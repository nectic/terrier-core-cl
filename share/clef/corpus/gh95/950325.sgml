DENISE O'Donoghue wishes she had said: ''Comedy is a serious
business.'' Well, she did say it. But what she means is that she wishes
she had said it first. This is perhaps not unconnected with the fact
that, as managing director of Hat Trick Productions, comedy for her is a
very serious business indeed. Seriously.
The joke is, of course, that the London-based independent production
house has given television more laughs than you could shake a tickling
stick at over the last decade (and, boy, have we needed them).
It was formed in 1986 by O'Donoghue, comedian Jimmy Mulville, and
comedy producer Geoffrey Perkins. Its beginnings were humble; the only
thing they had commissioned when they started was Chelmsford 123, a
curious Channel 4 sitcom set in Roman-occupied Britain. It wasn't
brilliant; not exactly at the cutting edge of television humour. But its
creators had ideas by the barrowload in their heads.
And those ideas were turned into programmes. Today its impressive list
of credits reads like a roll-call of everything that's good about
television comedy -- among them, Have I Got News For You, Whose Line Is
It Anyway?, Paul Merton -- The Series, Clive Anderson Talks Back, Room
101, and the second-funniest programme in the entire universe, Drop The
Dead Donkey (One Foot In The Grave beats it by a whisker).
This week sees the comically ambitious Hat Trick adding yet another
string to its bow with A Very Open Prison (BBC2, Sunday), its very first
full-length film. Starring Tom Wilkinson (Mr Pecksniff in Martin
Chuzzlewit) and Stephen Tompkinson (Damian in Drop The Dead Donkey), it
is a satirical comedy drama inspired by recent events in the prison
service. Written by Dead Donkey's creator Guy Jenkins, it opens BBC2's
latest Screen Two season.
Comedy, to use a variation on another old adage, is not so much about
timing for Hat Trick, it is more about speed. Earlier this year Jenkins
was in a taxi with other members of the fun factory's workforce. They
were heading for a meeting with the BBC to discuss the possibility of
making a topical drama. Being bright lads, it suddenly dawned on them
that the Beeb might just take a shine to the idea and ask them, there
and then, what they had in mind.
The problem was that, at that particular moment in time, they didn't
have anything specific to talk about. ''What about the prison service?''
someone said as the taxi sped through the London streets.
And so A Very Open Prison was born. It was conceived (in a taxi),
commissioned (shortly after they got out of the taxi) and written before
the taxi needed another tank of petrol (ie within a week). It will be
shown around the time the taxi needs its next service. We are talking
fast-work here.
Jenkins, of course, is no stranger to working at speed. One of the
great things about Drop The Dead Donkey is the way it includes gags
about real news events, some of which only happen the day before the
programme is transmitted.
This refreshing ''instant television'' approach to programme-making
looks like continuing. Hat Trick doesn't mess about. No sooner has it
done and dusted one quickfire movie than it is moving on to the next.
A Very Open Prison will be closely followed by a satirical drama about
football (A Very Open Game, Brian?), mopping up all the recent bad
publicity surrounding the game in England -- the bribery, the
match-fixing, the drugs and the violence. The intention is, once again,
to get it commissioned and made as fast as possible and then get it out
while it is still topical.
Of course, it doesn't always work out. It was disclosed last week that
Hat Trick's plan to make a movie version of Drop The Dead Donkey has
been shelved after two years in the pending tray. Channel 4, normally a
great champion of feature-film finance, decided that it couldn't
increase the #1.3m budget for the movie. But this obvious disappointment
won't stop the independent company pursuing other ambitious film
projects in the future.
So how did this comedy-on-speed company start? In a flash, presumably.
''Well, I think it was really a classic Yosser Hughes thing,'' explains
Denise O'Donoghue, who worked in the City before moving into television
production. ''We'd all been working on a series called Who Dares Wins
and we suddenly thought 'We can do that'.
''We just thought we could give it a go. To be honest, I don't think
we realised what it was going to be about. We didn't have a great deal
of foresight. But what we did have was good management and cost-control
skills. We also knew comedy and comedy was -- and still is -- an area
which is undersubscribed by people who know it well.''
Hat Trick's philosophy is ''to make comedy programmes for profit''.
This sounds perhaps a tad mercenary but it is no more than realistic. It
is a business, after all, and like all businesses it wouldn't exist if
it didn't make a profit. And, if it didn't exist, it would not be able
to do what it does best -- identify, nurture, and promote new comedy
talent.
Without Hat Trick's help it is unlikely that people like Angus
Deayton, Tony Slattery, Harry Enfield, Paul Merton, and Clive Anderson
would ever have made it thus far.
Did Denise O'Donoghue think that comedy had changed much since ''Hat
Trick, The Early Years''?
''Well, we've gone through the Thatcher years and they've passed and
hopefully we'll have passed the Major years in the not-too-distant
future; the world has changed and the country has changed. But what is
funny is funny and that doesn't change. The secret is to know what is
funny.''
Considering Hat Trick's astonishingly successful track record to date,
was there anything which she reckoned hadn't worked out?
''Wanting to maintain my relationships with the people that I work
with I would say that we go into making the programmes with the same
enthusiasm and dedication whatever the idea. Some ideas, of course, work
better than others and that's life,'' she explains.
Most of the company's programmes have been taken up by BBC2 and
Channel 4 -- does this mean that they have an aversion to mainstream
television?
''Not at all. We started off in Who Dares Wins with C4 and we've
always had a really good relationship with them. They've been very good
to us. BBC2 has, to a certain extent, mirrored Channel 4. But we're keen
on working for BBC1 and ITV.
''There's a new Hat Trick production -- Confessions which is hosted by
Simon Mayo -- which will take over the Noel's House Party slot on BBC1
on Saturday nights. We have gone to BBC1 with a lot of sitcom ideas over
the years; it's just that none of them have been chosen.
''And we've been developing a number of drama projects for a while and
we've set up a separate film company. We have a lot of successful
programmes but we wouldn't want them to last forever. The challenge is
not to keep doing the same shows it is to keep finding more,'' she says.
Well, funny you should say that, Denise. There are a couple of wee
ideas I have here which might just . . .
* THERE'S a great deal at stake for BBC Scotland with the start of its
six-part drama series Hamish Macbeth (BBC1, Sunday). Queen Margaret
Drive really needs a major mainstream network success and they hope that
this will be the one to deliver. Somewhat unfairly perhaps, it has been
compared to ITV's Heartbeat but, apart from the fact that both feature
village policemen, they are completely different.
The big question is whether or not the series, a charming, slightly
whimsical, offbeat cop show (in which the only car chases involve
tractors), will be accepted down south. It might take some time before
the audience really warms to it.
In Danny Boyle's first scene setting episode, PC Macbeth (Robert
Carlyle) has to investigate the theft of a huge quantity of salt from
the local grocer's. Could it be connected to the mysterious
disappearance of a local bully whose wife, Hamish discovers, is
suffering from some unexplained injuries? The characters are perhaps
just a wee bit larger than life but there is a nice laid-back feel to
the series. The secret is to accept that the haggis-and-heather is
really a send-up of the classic tourist board image of Scotland.
* WITH Absolutely Fabulous (BBC1, Thursday) Jennifer Saunders created
one of the best comedy programmes of the Nineties. This will be the
third and final series. Perhaps no bad thing, in the circumstances,
since the last batch was showing ever-so-slightly worrying signs of wear
and tear. It just wasn't as funny. Wisely Saunders, who wrote the
series, has decided to quit while she's ahead.
The new series moves along at a slightly slower pace, concentrating
more upon the characters than upon the situations. The concept, of
course, has been purchased by Roseanne Barr's production company for an
American version (no word yet on who will play the Saunders/Lumley
roles).
Sadly, it sounds as if the US show will be but a pale shadow of its
British counterpart. Despite the fact that Absolutely Fabulous's appeal
lies in the fact that it is gloriously and ironically un-PC, the
Americans have pressed the ''delete fun'' button and ordered a curb on
the swearing, the smoking, the drugs, and the bad language (a move that
says more about the hypocrisy of the USA than it does about the
programme).
In this week's opening episode, Edina (Saunders) decides it's high
time she organised her hectic high-powered life so she invests in a
computer. When that fails she decides to schedule her own life and sets
about solving her first two problems -- (1) what door handle should she
buy for the kitchen, and (2) where to drink lunch. Patsy (Joanna Lumley)
decides that New York is the only possible place to do both, so off they
go for a nibble at the Big Apple.

IT was never really necessary for Celtic people to wear a hard hat in
the old Jungle, but things are now changing in that part of the East End
of Glasgow, and in more ways than one. (Above) it looks as though
manager Tommy Burns had his breath -- and almost his hat -- taken away
with the view from the top of the new North Stand at Parkhead yesterday
as work continues on the redevelopment of the old ground, while (below)
the warning notice has been in place for ages, but Celtic supporters can
hardly wait for the day it is removed and once again the Hoops and take
to the grass.

THERE is confusion amongst some of your readers about the Clyde
Festival Gardens Proposal. There does not need to be a choice between a
permanent Garden Festival or a Science Centre -- Glasgow can have both
with our plan.
It is doubtful whether the Science Centre can survive on its own as
there will probably be a considerable revenue deficit. Only if a large
number of visitors are attracted to the area will it survive. That's why
we are also proposing what was so successful in 1988 -- the Garden
Festival. This, with a Maritime Heritage theme, would give Glasgow the
unique major tourist attraction which has been ''unequivocally
welcomed'' by the Scottish Tourist Board.
The plan as proposed by Miller/GDA is for a veritable cliff of
buildings, including a massive multi-screen cinema, lining the river
bank with very long, narrow walkways which block out the lovely views to
the north. From the south, these buildings will be seen across a huge
car-park.
Will people want to use such a place at night? No matter how well
designed the winning entry of the Science Centre competition, the
building is in a very awkward position stuck out on a narrow promontory.
It would be better to be in the position we have shown for such a
prestigious building with plenty of space around it.
The Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland ''strongly endorsed the
layout of this scheme'' and stated: ''The combination of a Tivoli,
Horden's Tower and the Maritime Centre might offer more than other plans
for the area.''

I AGREE with Neil MacCallum (Teaching dialect, March 20) on one thing
only -- he is no educationalist. Even Jean Brodie could accept that
education meant drawing out a child's potential, not force-feeding it
with irrelevancies. This is especially so where language is concerned.
I'm not sure that language can be taught at all; the teacher can only
try to provide optimum conditions for learning.
Emphasising to a child that the language of his home and family is ''a
bastard lingo compounded of rudimentary Scots on one hand and
mispronounced English on the other'' doesn't seem likely to provide much
motivation, only a reduplicated sense of rejection and alienation.
The days when children were belted for saying kye instead of cattle
are gone, thank Heaven, but Neil MacCallum seems to feel that the way
forward is to dish out punishment exercises for the use of the dialectal
form ''coos'' -- doubled if you forget that the correct Standard
Scottish spelling is ''cous''.
On behalf of the vast majority -- geesabrek!

DR BRIAN Mawhinney, Secretary of State for Transport, recently called
for a national debate on future policy regarding transport and the
environment. He said that such a debate should be properly informed and
should avoid day-dreaming. Sadly, the issue of freight transport and its
relation to road building, air quality, safety, rail use, and consumer
expectation has been riddled with uninformed prejudice and idealistic
wishful thinking.
Industry's view is that improved transport efficiency in recent years
means that there are now fewer goods vehicles moving more goods. The
newer breed of vehicles are cleaner and quieter and cause less wear to
the road and less emission to the atmosphere. Lorries are involved in
fewer accidents than any other type of vehicle. Lorry operators are
conscious of their obligations to the public, to other road users, and
to the environment.
Clearly, many conservation and environmental groups share a somewhat
different opinion. They say that we can reduce the amount of goods we
move around. They say that we can put all the freight on the railways.
They say that lorries pollute the atmosphere and are unsafe. They say
that we do not need roads, they only fill with traffic.
But goods only move if they are wanted either as a constituent part of
a manufacturing process or as an end product in themselves. So transport
is a sign of economic and consumer demand. If the public continues to
demand the range and quantity of goods now available and within reach of
almost all UK citizens, then the public needs to tolerate the transport
required to deliver them.
Somehow industry has to find an economic, efficient, and
environmentally friendly way to deliver tomorrow's breakfast and the
thousands of items that sustain our modern lifestyle every day.
We can do it on a developed roads infrastructure, on safe and clean
lorries operated by environmentally conscious companies, or we can allow
the roads infrastructure to decay, introduce more lorry bans, and raise
the levels of taxation on transport, reducing choice and increasing
costs.
After all, aside from satisfying consumer demand and creating jobs and
prosperity, why do we need all these goods anyway?

BRIAN Meek cannot be serious when he praises current standards on BR
and then claims that the Conservative Government is solely responsible
for the improved situation and his party has nothing to apologise for
regarding the state of the railways (March 16).
He contradicts himself when, in his final paragraph, he acknowledges
Mrs Thatcher's open hostility towards railways and the indifference of
many members of the Cabinet.
I would say that credit should go to the managers and staff of BR who
have done reasonably well under very adverse conditions, and one can
only imagine what could have been achieved under a forward-looking and
encouraging Government.
However, Brian Meek is on the right lines when he pleads with the
Government to abandon its current privatisation plans, and one can only
hope that it will observe all the signals it is being given and stop
before it causes a derailment.

THE thrust of Lord Gill's article, criticising the delays and
complexities of the civil legal systems, is commendable, if only to
canvass the issue before those whom it is intended to serve (March 22).
It seems to me that his criticism is solely directed against the Court
of Session, which is the supreme court in Scotland. I am sorry that Lord
Gill did not distinguish the position so far as the lower, sheriff court
is concerned.
While the problems highlighted by Lord Gill may essentially be shared
between the two courts, neither the cause nor the solution put forward
by Lord Gill reflect this practitioner's experience.
As recently as last year, the procedure in the sheriff court underwent
radical change. The system was considerably streamlined, producing, in
certain situations, manifest time-savings in comparison to its
predecessor; but only to those able to use the system.
There is, therefore, nothing wrong with the structure of the current
system per se. The system is designed to elicit the true dispute between
parties. Some disputes are crystal-clear; others are opaque. The new
powers of sheriffs to intervene should help separate the former from the
latter and thus reduce delay.
However, in true legalese, there is one essential exception to this
new utopia: the system is not serving the public, because it is
under-staffed and under-resourced.
When Lord Gill complains of the frustration among witnesses held in
court all day, only to be sent away without giving evidence, it is my
experience that the cause is invariably the lack of an available court,
which produces delay in the system.
Just as Parliament ultimately controls the evolution of the civil
justice system, based on advice from its practitioners, it also controls
the purse-strings, based on advice from its Treasury.
While Parliament has gone considerably forward in reforming the
system, the Treasury has gone considerably backward in funding. The net
result is that the system is not able to function efficiently, which
leads to delay and frustration.
More pervasively, the system has become available only to the very
poor, the very rich, the very brave, or the very stupid.
In the case of the civil legal system it is the Government's avowed
intention to make the system self-funding. Thus, last year we saw the
imposition of an arbitrary and iniquitous tax on using the system, with
a huge increase in fees payable to the courts. We were promised similar
annual rises thereafter, but this year, in a flurry of non-publicity,
the increase was suspended, though not abandoned.
The relentless annual restrictions on eligibility for legal aid have
further depleted access to civil courts.
It is not entirely the Government's fault: if it perceives that the
public does not wish to spend adequate sums to support a system open to
all, and if the public accepts that perception, then no tinkering with
the system will solve the nature of the problem.
Certainly the condemnation of an apparent complacency by its
practitioners, who allegedly hold a ''seeming indifference'' to
litigants' amazement at the complexities, costs, and delays, does not
advance any meaningful solution.
It is disappointing that Lord Gill has chosen to highlight a criticism
which bears little relevance to the true extent of the problem.

<TEXT>
I WAS delighted to read Lord Gill's article. It appeared to me that
this was the first time that a senior member of the Scottish legal
profession has expressed such an honest opinion on the inadequacies of
civil justice in this country.
The new sheriff court procedure and the new commercial court procedure
in the Court of Session have done little to improve the situation, even
although some sheriffs and Lord Penrose do strive to help.
If we have to await the judiciary and the profession being promoters
of reform, I suspect that we will wait an eternity. I also suspect that
Lord Gill may well be greatly disappointed at his retirement date of
2017.
I assume that Lord Gill was not referring to arbitration when he
quoted: ''If the law fails to meet the public's needs, there is the
ever-present danger of less savoury methods of dispute resolution.''
Lord Gill also says: ''We must move from the idea of the judge as the
passive arbiter to that of the judge as the manager of litigation.''
This may be the impression the judiciary and the profession have of
Scottish arbitration.
Why should that be the case? It is probably because Scottish
arbitration procedures are not laid down in statute but are recommended
to their clients by practitioners in the Scottish legal profession.
Those recommendations generally are a mirror image of the civil
litigation procedure, ie formal written pleadings, adjustments, legal
debates, amendments, and an adversarial proof before answer.
The Scottish legal profession do not seem to be prepared to allow the
arbiter to manage the arbitration. The problem is further compounded by
the fact that many Scottish commerical transactions are governed by
standard contracts which contain ancillary arbitration clauses.
The general rule of law in Scotland is that where the parties have
agreed to arbitration, to arbitration they must go. The parties then
attempt to agree the name of the arbiter, arbitration rules and
procedures. They generally then form a tripartite contract by way of a
formal deed of submission or appointment. These steps can take many
months. Thereafter, civil litigation-style procedure is adopted. There
are no perceived benefits in going to arbitration, only further delays.
I have been actively recommending that Scottish building construction
contracts should contain an arbitration procedure as well as an
ancillary arbitration clause. I have drafted my proposed procedure which
is non-adversarial and gives the arbiter power to visit the offices of
each party to inspect all the evidence which the parties wish to lay
before him.
I invite the committee to consider adopting and including such a
procedure into their standard forms of construction contract.

I was glad to read Harry Diamond's tribute to the late J B McLaren,
with special appreciation of his skills in the day-to-day journalism of
half a century ago. I hope it's not too late to add a word about another
side of Jim McLaren's enthusiastic pursuit of life's variety.
He loved the Scottish countryside and knew a lot about it, from days
when -- even before the internal combustion engine captured him for the
rest of his life -- he explored the roads round about Glasgow by
pushbike.
He loved the waterways of all kinds, especially of course those that
could be sailed upon or fished in -- and these pastimes, again, he
entered into with an exhilarating mixture of skill, enterprise, and
originality.
Does anyone remember ''McLaren's Planks'', the home-made catamaran he
sailed with hair-raising gusto over the windiest patches of Loch Lomond?
My own memories of him, partly of working side-by-side -- at one time
literally -- in the Herald office, are even more vividly connected with
the island of Lismore. He made many visits there in the fifties and
sixties, often driving me up the 100-odd miles in what I recall as a
remarkably short time. But he never took car or motor-bike across the
water, and we went all over the island on foot or on ancient bicycles.
He fished with skill and persistence in the island waters. On one of
his first visits he caught and gave away a huge lythe, and this
doubtless established his reputation, for while folk knew that he
''wrote about motors'', they usually alluded to him, and remember him
still, as ''your friend the fisherman''.
I am proud to have this memorial of a long friendship.

A FEW dozen yards from where the bones of John Knox lie beneath the
tarmac of the Court of Session car-park is court number 12. Two days ago
I would not have been surprised if revolving sounds were heard to
emanate from the ground as proceedings drew to a close in Lord Osborne's
court. Nothing less than the independence of the church from the state
was at stake.
Edinburgh is filled with reminders of how this question has echoed
through the past 500 years of Scottish history. Cheek by jowl with the
Court of Session is the pulpit of St Giles', from which Knox trumpeted
defiance at the state in 1560, holding out his ideal of a godly
commonwealth which was beholden to no monarch.
Down the hill is the kirkyard of Greyfriars where in 1638 the
Covenanters signed in their own blood a document proclaiming the freedom
of religion from state control. To the north, in the New Town, is the
kirk which was the scene of the famous General Assembly of 1843 in which
the Claim of Right (of Christ to be head of a church free from state
control) was asserted by a defection of one-third of Kirk ministers.
Notice how the issue has recurred again and again in our history,
thankfully in a more peaceful manner each time. By the time it reached
court number 12 on Thursday, it had become a legal argument between two
QCs in front of a judge, to be decided in a written judgment by Lord
Osborne when he returns from a trip abroad in a fortnight. As an
Episcopalian, Lord Osborne will be well aware of differences between
Scotland and England on this issue. The Church of England is
indisputably subject to Parliament in most matters, including doctrine.
Remember that it required a House of Commons vote to ordain women as
priests.
In Scotland a different solution has been reached -- albeit after much
Covenanter blood, legal sweat, and not a few tears. In 1921, to persuade
the successors of the 1843 seceders back into the fold, a new deal was
formed. The Church of Scotland Act effectively loosed the established
church from the bonds of the state and created a national church which
was free to change and modify its doctrine and practice. It came into
effect in 1926 by an Order in Council after the General Assembly and a
majority of presbyteries had approved it, and did the trick as far the
seceders were concerned since it led directly to the 1929 reunion.
In Article IV of the schedule to the Act, the issue was left beyond
doubt: ''This Church as part of the Universal Church wherein the Lord
Jesus Christ has appointed a government in the hands of Church office
bearers, and receives from Him, its Divine King and Head, and from Him
alone, the right and power subject to no civil authority to legislate
and to adjudicate finally in all matters of doctrine, worship
government, and discipline in the Church . . . and to define the
boundaries of the spheres of labour of its ministers and other office
bearers.'' There are other articles which underline the position but it
is pretty clear. Shockingly clear, in fact. It means that even if the
Kirk acts unjustly or incompetently, it is subject to no appeal to a
higher authority. There is no higher authority. It is master in its own
house.
Well, that is the legal position, but lots of things have happened
since 1921: the Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, employment
legislation and tribunals, judicial reviews, multi-faith policies by the
state in education. All these coexist with the 1921 Act but appear to
have no leverage over it.
That is, until the Rev Tom Logan won an interim interdict last week
apparently preventing Dumbarton Presbytery from suspending him. It is
the first time the 1921 Act has been dented. In 1984 the Rev Alex Buchan
tried to get an interdict from Lord Stewart but failed. A few years ago
a Falkirk minister who was being made redundant tried to get a hearing
from an industrial tribunal but the Kirk's solicitor turned up waving
the Articles Declaratory. The issue is not about Logan's Amway
networking activity.
Neither is it his disobedience of his presbytery (the actual nature of
the charge against him) nor the way the presbytery has acted in
arraigning him. The issue is now the purely legal one of whether or not
the Kirk is subject to Judicial Review.
By lunchtime on Thursday it didn't look as though they were. Comparing
the Kirk to the Court of Session itself and the criminal courts, the
Procurator, Alastair Dunlop QC, diplomatically but firmly suggested that
jurisdiction simply did not exist since the church was subject only to
Jesus Christ. However, in the afternoon Iain Bonomy, QC for Logan, had
done enough to sow doubt. Since Parliament had legislated the 1921 Act
in the first place and gave lawful effect to Article IV, it therefore
had the power of judicial review. This finger in the door, he then cited
West v Secretary of State for Scotland, a 1992 case in which the
judgment appeared to define the scope of such review. Perhaps anxious
not to undermine this ruling, Lord Osborne is taking time to issue his
judgment.
Meanwhile we have the bizarre stand-off of Logan legally continuing to
minister (under civil law) while suspended (under ecclesiastical law).
Whether or not his trial will go ahead on April 19 remains to be seen.
If the presbytery cancels it, it will seem to have admitted that the
Court of Session has the right to blow the whistle in its pitch. It's
possible it will get Logan to make a gesture of compliance. If he
doesn't, then he will be guilty of a much graver offence. But Logan
might take his case as far as the European Court of Human Rights, if his
Amway friends don't run out of money before then, and the longer the
conflict is prolonged the more likelihood someone will start querying
whether a church can be a law unto itself. If that happens, the bones in
the car-park will really begin to birl.

IT was a revelation to me to discover from the article by Lord Gill
that Scotland actually possesses at least one judge who is still capable
of logical thinking.
It was also refreshing, as well as almost unique, to hear a member of
the judiciary admit that the Scots legal system is less than perfect, a
conclusion that is self-evident to almost anyone who has been on the
receiving end of the scrambled hash which is what family law is in this
country.
Lord Gill stated that we might have something to learn from English
civil law. I will go further and say that we have a lot to learn from
many other parts of the world such as the USA, Scandinavia, and
Australia, where the acrimony of family breakdown is frequently handled
in a manner which leads to a great improvement on the scandalous figure,
in Scotland today, of 73% of children losing contact with one of their
parents after families split-up.
The Children (Scotland) Bill, which is in committee stage in the House
of Commons, has the potential to reverse the national disaster which the
above statistic represents.
For this potential to be realised, it is necessary for our MPs, as
they currently amend this Bill, to become aware that the 14,000 Scottish
children each year who are victims of family breakdown deserve some
attention.

RANGERS' under-fire goalkeeper, Ally Maxwell, is ready to quit the
Ibrox club in the summer when his contract comes up for renewal.
I understand that Maxwell, who was barracked by the Ibrox support at
Tynecastle last week, wants to kick-start a new career for himself at
another club.
The one-time Scotland keeper joined Rangers from Motherwell as a
back-up for Andy Goram three years ago. But his Ibrox career has been
dogged with controversy. After having lost a goal -- and the game -- in
an Old Firm clash at Ibrox last season, Maxwell was assaulted by a fan
two days later when returning to the stadium after training.
Last week when he lost two bad goals against Hearts as Rangers plunged
to defeat at Tynecastle for the second time in a month, he was jeered
mercilessly by his own club's support.
Now, I believe, he has told close friends that he has had enough.
He wants to move from Rangers and possibly find a club where the
pressures -- and perhaps the prejudices -- are less, and the spotlight
less ruthless. My understanding is that Maxwell has already indicated
this to the club.
He joined Rangers in a deal which took him from Motherwell, where he
had been a cup-final hero for the Fir Park club on the day they won that
trophy. He played on with broken ribs in the final at Hampden to ensure
victory.
But, afterwards, his time there was soured by a contract row which
resulted in him going out of the game for a spell.
Rangers rescued his career -- or so it seemed -- when he was signed as
reserve to Goram.
Unfortunately, when the 30-year-old has been asked to take over at
Ibrox, the comparisons have been less than flattering and the mistakes
have been frequent and often costly.
He retained his Scotland squad spot until this season and now he looks
to be on his way out at Ibrox.
Goram is set to return at the start of next season, and manager Walter
Smith may look around for another deputy.

ONE would imagine that with all the up-to-date equipment now used in
banks service would be immediate.
Not so. I took a US dollar cheque to my High Street bank and was told
it would take at least two weeks to clear it.
When you think I could send a letter to America (and get a reply),
could fly there and back in less than two weeks, it is ridiculous that,

THE British economy is now performing in the manner desired by every
post-war Chancellor, but seldom for long achieved by any one of them.
The real test will be of time: how long can the good news persist to be
more than a flash-in-the-pan, a fate which befell Chancellors as diverse
as Maudling, Jenkins, and Lawson? Time itself will tell; but things ran
very well last year, turning a huge trade deficit into a surplus which
certainly seems to be repeatable this year. This outcome derives from
the combination of low inflation, rising productivity, and inexpensive
sterling and has been helped by the strength of the mark which
encourages exports to Germany, our biggest customer.
The mark's strength also permits British penetration of other markets,
where its strength reduces German competition. It has helped, too, that
the dollar has been so weak: most world commodities are still priced in
dollars and we still import to re-export after adding value to what was
raw material. The conjunction of these currency movements has proved to
be extremely fortunate.
The Chancellor was understandably cook-a-hoop when discussing these
figures in Edinburgh yesterday. His own (to some surprising) prudence
has made its contribution, and it need not be ignored any more than the
efforts of UK exporters. The fundamental forces are, however, the value
of sterling and the way in which domestic consumer demand has been
subdued along with wage costs. Mr Clarke, and before him Mr Lamont,
subdued demand by clobbering taxpayers on all fronts except the nominal
rates of income tax.
This has been especially true of housing where the steady reduction in
mortgage tax relief has dampened down the possibility of any marked
recovery in house prices after the big fall in interest rates since
1992. A stagnant housing market has prevented equity release (profits
from house sales) fuelling the retail sector and sucking in imports, as
occurred often in the past. Instead, export markets have had a free run,
and capacity strains have yet to appear. The other side of this coin is
that its success does not immediately touch many, except that it
promotes more employment opportunities -- hence the improving trend of
unemployment. For that reason the Government will get little credit in
the shape of the so-called feel-good factor and its electoral
implications.
The other reason for the lack of public enthusiasm is the realisation
that what looks like sustainable good fortune has arrived more by
accident than design. Our leaving the ERM was enforced by factors beyond
the Government's control. Its related devaluation has proved to be
immensely beneficial, yet it represented the defeat of the policies to
which the Government was committed. On the other hand all previous
devaluations have had many of their potential benefits eliminated by
inflation. That this has not happened this time is to the Government's
credit. Not all of the outcome is popular, especially in its effect on
the incomes of those with savings in the likes of bank and building
society deposits where returns look very low no matter what they may be
in real terms.
These figures still have some political resonance. They will do Tory
morale at least some good before the local elections, which are widely
expected to deliver crushing blows. They do afford the Chancellor some
scope for manoeuvre on the interest-rate front. It is, however, on the
other deficit -- that on the public revenue account -- that the Tories
will want to focus. With taxation rising again next month, it is that
account which may provide for reduction. Any surplus would be better
spent on public services like education and the NHS, but Tories will
insist on lower income taxes, if only to bring things back to what they
were when Mr Major was first elected.

RUSSIA have underlined the importance they place on their European
Championship game against Scotland in Moscow next week by moving their
training camp to Germany, writes Ken Gallacher.
It was there, on Thursday, that the Russian coach, Oleg Romantsev,
gathered his 20 players around him.
The home-based Russians, along with those from Italy and Spain, were
flown to Frankfurt to join those who play in Germany where a special
preparation centre has been set up in advance of the group game.
A spokesman for the Russian FA explained: ''The coach believes this to
be one of the most important games we will play in the qualifying
section. He wants only the best situation for the players and he
believed that would exist in Germany. It is difficult, sometimes, to
have everyone happy in Moscow.
''So many of our players are used to living in the West now and so
they look for very different things. This way, by moving our meeting
place, we have, we hope, the best of both worlds.
''We have the players together for close to a week, which is vital for
a game such as this. And we have them putting themselves into the best
of condition with no complaints about the surroundings, facilities, or
the food.''
Last night Scotland manager Craig Brown, warned: ''This demonstrates
again just how seriously the Russians are taking us. They know we are
one of their rivals as far as reaching the finals is concerned.
''If you remember when they played us at Hampden and we drew with them
there they arrived in Scotland on the Friday before the game. Now they
have all been brought together almost a week before the match and
they're doing their training in the most professional football company
in Europe.
''That should tell us something about what is at stake on Wednesday.''
The Russians, in fact, will arrive in Moscow for their own home game
just a few hours ahead of the Scotland squad on Monday.
Meanwhile, Brown still faces injury problems over his own pool. Stuart
McCall and Craig Levein will face fitness tests when the players gather
at Motherwell today. It could be that the pair will be left at home,
further adding to the injury problems which have beset Brown since he
named his squad last week.
* JEAN-MICHEL Ferri, of Nantes, has been banned for eight matches by
the sport's governing body in Europe for ''extremely brutal'' conduct in
a recent UEFA Cup tie. He was sent off against Bayer Leverkusen, of
Germany, for elbowing an opponent.
* ENGLAND captain David Platt will not be in the Sampdoria line up
when the Italian club meet Arsenal in the semi-final stage of the
European Cup-winners' Cup.
The midfield player was sent off towards the end of the penalty
shoot-out win against Bobby Robson's Porto and so now is suspended.
Platt had hoped to escape with a one-match ban which would have meant
him being available for the return against the London side on April 20.
But UEFA's disciplinary committee took into account the nature of the
foul and his previous record in reaching their verdict.
* THE English league are hosting another National Family Day this
weekend at grounds throughout the country. Discounts, concessions, and
activities are on offer for family supporters at the 35 Endsleigh League
games taking place today and tomorrow.

THE GHK captain, Walter Malcolm, spoke for club skippers across the
breadth of Scotland yesterday when he declared that today's encounter
with Stirling County represents a ''huge'' game for the Old Anniesland
club.
Next season's league reconstruction -- with only eight clubs winning
places in Division One of the Premier League -- has concentrated minds
much in the manner of a ''guid hanging'' and GHK are not alone as they
face the prospect of 80 minutes play determining their fortunes, in some
cases literally, next term.
By the end of the season the old 14-team leagues will be consigned to
the archives and, for clubs with a mind to prosper in the upper echelons
of the new cut-and-thrust eight-team divisions, success today is vital.
GHK, currently in eighth place, have to win at Bridgehaugh if they are
to maintain the success story which saw them promoted as Division Two
champions last season.
Elsewhere, too, the heat is on. Hawick and Gala, for long enough
rugby's equivalent of the Old Firm, meet at Mansfield Park, where Hawick
in particular can settle their future without outside help only if they
win.
At the Greenyards, where last season's champions Melrose entertain
Heriot's FP, the city side, presently in ninth spot but with a postponed
game in hand -- albeit against champions Stirling County -- view the
prospect, in the words of coaching director Fraser Dall as ''make or
break for us''. They require three points from both games to make sure
that they do not drop out of the top division for the first time.
GHK have again lost Murray Wallace to a knee injury, but in the credit
balance Steve Hirini has made such an unexpectedly speedy recovery from
a cheekbone injury that he is in the team.
GHK have to beat the champions to be sure of being in the first
division of the restructured league. Defeat would mean relying on
Heriot's and West of Scotland slipping up.
At Mansfield Park, Hawick who recall Cammy Murray on the right wing
after a head injury, are four points ahead of West of Scotland whereas
Gala, though slightly further up the table, are the only one of the
eight contenders with a minus points differential. Hawick require a
single point to ensure first division survival.
For Gala, today's game represents what could well be a farewell league
appearance for Gregor Townsend and Mike Dods. Both have signed
provisional forms which may well take them south to Northampton next
season.
West are three points behind GHK though with a game in hand, and they
will be without David Barrett, their versatile Glasgow back, for the
remaining matches -- against Currie at Malleny Park and Edinburgh
Academicals next Saturday at Burnbrae.
Melrose will be without Craig Chalmers for the visit by Heriot's. The
Scotland stand-off, and his wife, have accepted a trip to the Hong Kong
sevens as guests. In the circumstances, his club's apparent
disappointment is understandable.

SEVEN European Union countries will abandon internal border controls
from tomorrow; the end of the world is not expected to ensue. This may
be something of a disappointment to Sir Teddy Taylor, the indefatigable
MP for Southend East, who loves a conspiracy theory if he can locate it
on the European Continent. There is an obsession, he confided to the
Prime Minister this week, in the rest of Europe specifically designed to
get rid of British border controls. Mr Major needed no urging to impale
himself on this one. Putting on his very serious face, he assured MPs
that any changes to Britain's controls were unacceptable and that he
would seek a treaty amendment to defend them if necessary. It is too
late for this ringing endorsement of the status quo to bring comfort to
British Customs officers who have seen their frontline numbers cut as
part of a reorganisation of our border controls. Nevertheless, there is
an element of truth in Sir Teddy's charges, and while it does not
qualify as a conspiracy it could certainly be described as malicious.
The French European Affairs Minister took evident delight in pointing
out that EU travellers whose countries had not signed up to the Schengen
accord, which is the treaty vehicle for dispensing with internal
controls, would find themselves facing tough passport controls. As tough
passport controls are just what our Government wants, how can we
complain?
Really, it is time for some commonsense to be brought to bear on the
borders issue. France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg,
Portugal, and Spain are the countries participating from tomorrow in the
Schengen accord, and most continental EU member nations are expected to
join as soon as they can. The worries of Sir Teddy and his colleagues
would be more easily accepted if there was not a suspicion that they are
yet another part of the general anti-Europe agenda which flourishes
rankly in the southern English undergrowth. Nobody, not even the most
ardent pro-European, is in favour of dropping those controls which are
essential to the well-being and protection of the nation. Nor (and this
may come as something of a surprise to Sir Teddy) are the Schengen
accord nations.
The relaxing of border controls within the participating EU nations is
accompanied by a compensating strengthening of external border controls.
A centralised computer system to track the movement of criminals is an
important feature of the system. Based in Strasbourg, this
super-computer contains 10 million files and the names of a million
undesirables. It will also be used to track stolen cars, crime suspects,
illegal arms, and forged money. This is the stuff of a Home Secretary's
dreams and though thumbscrews would be required to force Mr Howard to
admit it, he must regret the political strait-jacket which prevents his
department taking advantage. It is, of course, foolish to suggest that
Britain should join the Schengen accord simply because other EU nations
have done so, and more will. The way forward lies in a properly informed
debate devoid, as far as is humanly possible, of childish
scaremongering. Europe is a grown-up place; we must learn to behave like
adults, too.

AS ONE of Scotland's greatest entertainers, Davie Cooper, whose death
on Thursday remains impossible for Scottish football to comprehend,
would have appreciated that the show must go on, but the Scottish
international squad will not even start training today at Fir Park
without having a minute's silence to remember the man who wore the
dark-blue shirt 22 times.
''We also hope to wear black armbands and have a minute's respect for
Davie before the game with Russia on Wednesday,'' said manager Craig
Brown. No instructions from the Scottish League were issued for today's
matches but secretary Peter Donald said that he had no doubt that the
home clubs would organise an obligatory period of silence before their
matches.
The Scotland squad and officials would have been present at Cooper's
funeral on Monday in full complement but have to follow the travel
arrangements already scheduled and will be leaving that morning.
Brown has decided to delay decisions on the fitness of Stuart McCall,
of Rangers, and Hearts' Craig Levein until they turn up for training
today.
McCall, who has had a persistent ankle injury, is unlikely to be
considered a possible starter. If Levein also is ruled out, Brown would
then deem it necessary to add an extra name as cover in the pool.
''I feel we would have enough back-up in the defence if Craig is out,
but if both are out, I would prefer to bring another player as an extra
cover,'' said Brown, who will be thinking of men like Billy McKinlay, of
Dundee United, Celtic's Phil O'Donnell, and Pat Nevin, of Tranmere
Rovers, who is playing today against Millwall.
''The fitness of McCall and Levein will be left to our medical men but
I have spoken to Walter Smith, who is a bit worried about how his player
will react to training.''
Falkirk and Kilmarnock have the premier division to themselves today
when they meet at Brockville in the game postponed a week ago. Both will
be seeking a win to reduce the threat of relegation.
What does seem certain is that there will be plenty of action. In the
games between the teams this season there have been 11 goals, five red
and seven yellow cards, statistics which suggest it might be best not to
blink this afternoon.
Kilmarnock will almost certainly be without striker Tom Brown because
of an ankle injury and defender Mark Skilling, who has a broken nose,
but newcomer Billy Findlay is likely to start his first game.
Manager Alex Totten is likely to renew his efforts to sign Bolton's
Owen Coyle before next Friday's transfer deadline.
Falkirk have five players suspended, and John Clark is doubtful with a
groin injury.

Andrew MacKay discovers a beer which was originally brewed in the
farmhouses of Flanders and travels well across the Channel
WHEN the raw March winds penetrated Cellarman's waxed groundsheet of a
jacket, it was time to pump up the ABV and seek out some warmth. But
what is there to drink that comes by the imperial pint and provides
(Bovril apart) the needful measure of comfort? Thankfully many of our
brewers have responded by producing strong fruity ales with a scale of
aftertastes from the bittersweet, hoppy to lingering malt.
None is for session drinking, unless you are really feeling the cold,
as they possess upwards of 5% alcohol by volume. Abbot Ale from Greene
King, Young's Winter Warmer and Ridley's Winter Ale fall into this
category and are worth a try for their individual peculiarities. Despite
being made south of the Border, they turn up in some Scottish bars.
Available on a greater scale is Old Peculier, top of the range from
Theakston, smooth, fruity, rich and warming, with an ABV 5.6% has
everything one could desire.
Another ale that has the characteristics of the robust was discovered
by Cellarman after the wraps were lifted off the remains of the beer
from the New Year gathering. A couple of gems were surrounded by a few
delinquents who had probably chinked their way through the Chunnel in
the hold of a seatless Renault Espace.
Long and sleek, they looked quite grand. Just like bottles of
champagne without the silver paper around the cork. The label spoke in
French, Biere de Garde, brasee a l'ancienne, Ch'ti. In the background
was a drawing of a coal miner wearing a helmet.
What we have is the amber variety of beer from the Castelain Brewery,
Benifontaine, a brewery that specialises in bieres de garde under the
name Ch'ti, which is regional jargon for northerner. The area common to
these beers is close to the Belgian border in the French Lowlands.
Bieres de garde were first produced in February and March to ''lay
down'' for the summer months when the climate made brewing impossible.
Normally they are top-fermenting but in some cases a bottom yeast is
used at warm temperatures to produce the characteristics of a darker
ale.
When this type of beer was first made it was brewed in the farmhouse.
Customers would bring bottles or crocks to be filled in much the same
way as today's French public buy table wine by the plastic pitcher.
There are some specialist brewers who produce the beer all year round
and occasionally make a seasonal special such as Christmas beers or
Biere de Mars. The champagne-style bottle identifies bieres de garde and
has been acquired through the widespread use of malting barley grown in
the Champagne region of France.
The Ch'ti brewery, our specimen, is almost 70 years old and is located
in the one-time mining village of Benefontaine, just north of Lens on
the Borders of Flanders and Artois. The beer, just like folk, comes in
blonde, brune, and ambree varieties, and with distinctive
characteristics of taste.
The blonde has a malty flavour while the ambree is more complicated in
make-up but with a good depth of taste. The brune is nicely balanced
with a hint of port.
Castelain also makes a strong and fruity speciality beer called Sint
Arnoldus. It is first filtered and then re-yeasted before being bottled
sur lie (on sediment). Additional beers made by the brewery include
seasonal beers and an organic brew called Jade.
Ch'ti is available from Safeway shops at around #2.10 the bottle.
Of the same froth and spotted in Oddbins was Jenlain from the Duyck
brewery near Valenciennes. Jenlain was the brewery's first child and
arrived in a bottle, an adventurous move at the time. This pioneer is
named after the hamlet in which the brewery is located.
Felix Duyck founded the brewery at Jenlain in 1922 although brewing
appears to have been carried out by the family long before this. The
family house overlooks the brewery and the Duyck crest above the door
bears the date 1840. Despite a huge increase in production from those
early days the brewery has not lost the appearance of its youth and
still resembles a farmhouse.
Biere de Garde Jenlain makes a spicy alternative with a full malty
flavour is not insubstantial in strength with an ABV of 6.5%, 50cl
#1.75.
It's time for Cellarman to walk the dog; a pint of Pickled Squirrel or
Tommy Todd Porter is coming on. But where did they get those names?

After being lovingly restored certain treasures are almost ready to be
revealed. Lesley Duncan delights in a preview of the frescos which had
been hidden under the dust of decades
A NAKED Neptune, drawn by two Centaurs baring their teeth in horsy
grins, rises from the sea and approaches a virgin, who waits on the
shore with bared breast. The scene, depicted in vivid colours, conjures
up the sunlit, sensuous world of late Renaissance Italy.
Yet neither the public paying their #3.50 a head, nor the European
heads of State at the Edinburgh Summit, would have given a second glance
to this or any other of Lattanzio Gambara's eight frescos, set high on
the walls of the Great Stair of Holyroodhouse.
Layers of glue and varnish, and a century of neglect, gave them a
coating that obscured colour and obliterated detail.
''It was almost like looking into a cup of coffee,'' says Clare
Meredith, who has been co-ordinating the team of conservators in the
palace since work started last month on the frescos' first major
renovation in more than a century. Created for the Palazzo Pedrocca in
Brescia, Lombardy, more than four centuries ago, they were purchased by
Prince Albert in 1856, apparently as references for the new Houses of
Parliament. Having served that purpose, they languished at Kensington
Palace, until they were moved to Holyroodhouse in 1881 and transferred
on to canvas.
Until recently they lay, like huge oil paintings, in the palace
kitchen, where food for royals and moderators of the General Assembly of
the Church of Scotland is prepared. With its wall space, flat surfaces,
air-conditioning, and strip lighting, the kitchen was simply the most
convenient place to do renovation. Clare Meredith explained how the
weight of the frescos had caused the 1882 lining canvas to rip away at
the edges. Heavyweight polyester sailcloth was used to stabilise the
sides and they are now re-attached to their 1882 stretchers. The frescos
had been treated as oil paintings, and layers of varnish, glue, and
surface dirt had to be removed, using current conservation methods. The
kitchen's extractor fans dealt with the ammonia fumes at this point.
''There are,'' says Clare Meredith, ''inevitably areas of damage,
loss, and earlier repairs, but overall the frescos are in a good
condition and, now cleaned, show their true colours, as fresco is one of
the most permanent painting techniques.''
Ovid's Metamorphoses provides the storyline. The biggest of the works,
lying for the moment at the foot of the Great Stair, shows Neptune drawn
by two hippocampi. As they approach from the sea, a young woman waits,
remarkably unfazed, under a tree.
In Ovid's scenario, Neptune was intent on rape. His victim, the virgin
Caenis, was so determined to avoid this that she begged to be turned
into a man. As Caeneus, she became a hero in the fight of the Lapiths
against the Centaurs at the wedding of Pirithous and Hippodamia, the
subject of three further frescos.
Before leaving Neptune to his dastardly intents, I couldn't help
noting the three domestic irons that lay incongruously on a painted
surface with dampened paper underneath. Liz Rose used them to flatten
out bulges in the canvas, an example of the ingenuity of the
conservation team, a high-powered group with fine arts degrees and
postgraduate qualifications.
Clare Meredith was involved in what she called ''the icing on the
cake'', the in-painting or retouching of areas of loss or damage as well
as earlier restorers' fills and overpaints.
Jane Hutchison retouched the first of the nuptial scenes, showing the
hapless Hippodamia seized by the hair by a Centaur while plates and wine
vessels go flying. She worked with watercolours which have the twin
benefits of being readily reversible and sympathetic to the fresco. The
colours, inorganic pigments such as yellow ochre, raw umber, and raw
sienna, would have been in common use in the sixteenth century.
The Centaurs, who seem to have unusually long, though decorously
undefined, human torsos, get the worst of the marriage mayhem. One is
transfixed by a spear wielded by the groom Pirithous, while a man
dressed as Hercules in a lion-skin wields a club, and a woman's face
peers out from the melee.
Hercules's club shows the giornata line, where the artist finished his
work on wet plaster for the day and had to try to pick up the identical
colour on his next stint. Also visible are the divisions of the backing
canvases.
Perhaps the most beautiful of the scenes is that showing a young woman
astride a sheep or ram with a man in golden armour at her feet. The
woman's blonde hair, and pink and green draperies, billow in the wind.
Her face has an imperious, rosy composure. The pair may be an allegory
for Fortitude and Charity.
Sally Cheyne travelled daily from Glasgow to join the conservation
team. She worked on Mercury, whose winged helmet and tumbling curls have
emerged from the murk. ''The frescos have a really nice quality,'' she
says.
The public can make their own judgment on April 1, at the reopening of
the Great Stair, with its freshened frescos, its elaborately moulded
ceiling cleaned, its tapestries rehung, and a new carpet (soft blue with
thistle motif at the edges). The fresco work will have cost #12,000,
most of it funded by entrance charges.
Scotland's Royal palace has been undergoing other changes under
Colonel David Anderson, the former Royal Army Ordnance officer who
became superintendent 18 months ago. Colonel Anderson, who comes from
Belfast and was for five years deputy governor of the Tower of London,
brings enthusiasm and a fresh outlook to the job.
The red carpet has been literally rolled out for the public in the
throne room, and the curtains have released from their plastic bags.
Visitors can now take a close look at the portraits, which include
Lely's studies of the swarthy Charles II and his doting and
much-deceived wife, Catherine of Braganza.
Colonel Anderson is quite prepared to replace this carpet, and the one
in the picture gallery, if they are worn down by visitors' feet. Only
where irreplaceable carpets are too frail for general plodding will the
public be cordoned off. The apartments of Mary Queen of Scots are being
restored to their period condition, and a portrait of Mary discovered in
a ''big shed'' at Holyrood will be on view, along with other Stuart
memorabilia from Windsor. A four-language guide, including Japanese, is
being prepared.
The palace gardens, in the lee of Arthur's Seat, will be opened to the
public, and the mews are being developed, with a new shop and a tearoom
for much-needed refreshments. After all, exploring Scotland's history
can be a tiring, though enjoyable, business.

The Herald's team of reviewers offer an informed tour round the latest
sounds
Vibe, Steps Ahead (NYC)
* All hail the terpsichorean power of the new-now-jazz, from Ronny
Jordan to United Future Organisation! A seasoned vibraphone player, Mike
Mainieri has worked with top dudes ranging from David Sanborn to Buddy
Rich. On this album, he has assembled a smokin' ensemble of disciplined
young contenders whose names will become legend in their own right -- we
mean you, Rachel Z, Donny McCaslin, Adam Holzman, Michael Cain, Victor
Bailey, and Clarence Penn -- in order to create an atmospheric and
mellow brand of dance-oriented grooviness. Get vibed-up with Vibe today.
Medusa, Annie Lennox (RCA)
* Ms Lennox has an enjoyable bash at some of her fave songs, ones
originally recorded by other folk, including oor ain Blue Nile and Rab
Marley, plus Procol Harum, Talking Heads, the Clash, Neil Young. Mr
Young's Don't Let It Get You Down fares rather well, along with the
current hit single, No More I Love Yous, and the Tempts' I Can't Get
Next To You. Much more than acts of celebrity-karaoke, they all work
because they focus on the wondrous pipes of Ms Lennox herself. Ah, but
can Annie out-sing Niley-boy Paul Buchanan on Downtown Lights?
Apparently motivated by a spirit of Presbyterian prohibition, some
umbraged native critics have thought not. Me, I say all versions of Blue
Nile songs are good, because Blue Nile songs are holy and cannot help
but work miracles on folk who sing them, yay and verily, even unto such
tripesters as Runrig (should they ever get wise). Thank you, Ms Lennox.
Uptown Down South, various (Kent)
* A collection of 24 primal emotings recorded on a network of
interrelated Nashville soul and r&amp;b labels -- Excello, NASCO, A-Bet --
between 1967 and 1974. Among the best-known names are Marva Whitney,
Shirley Brown, and Z Z Hill. Among the near-unknowns are Percy Wiggins,
Skip Mahoaney and the Casuals, and Lee Brackett. What do you really need
to know? That this is an Afro-American pop corker.
One Step Ahead Of The Spider, MC 900Ft Jesus (American)
* Tom Waits as re-invented by Beck and De La Soul: whispery,
white-trash rap with a poetic eye for the low-life verities. Sample?
''It was just a couple of minutes before midnight when Bill waddled back
into the living-room carrying a huge bowl of butter-soaked popcorn. On
TV, a lithe, young Spandex-clad cheerleader type was touting the
benefits of the latest quick weight-loss programme. 'Oh, mind your own
business, you tedious bimbo,' yelled Bill as he gracefully eased his
360lb frame on to a well-worn sofa.'' Buy! April 9, King Tut's, Glasgow
. . . attend!
Compiled by David Belcher
Inchcolm, William Jackson (Linn)
* Jackson's first new recording since 1990's St Mungo Suite ranges in
style from a lovely thirteenth-century chant to a brave, rewarding
improvisation on a Kalil Gibran poem. In between are some typically
graceful tunes for folk group, and two stunners featuring the SCO
Strings, the lively Corryvreckan and the beautifully measured
Columcille, the most successful fusion of traditional and classical
forms since Shaun Davey's Brendan Voyage.
Jacky Terrasson, Jacky Terrasson (Blue Note)
* The opening track, a deftly camouflaged I Love Paris, signals a
piano playing talent of cunning, individuality, beautiful touch, and
considerable powers of invention -- and the other 10 tracks (most of
them far from standard-issue standards and all featuring Terrasson's
eminently capable trio) merely go on to confirm this. Beware: this CD
may require surgical removal from your machine.
Compiled by Rob Adams
Americans in Europe, various (Impulse)
* IN 1963, 25 Europe-based American jazzers took part in a concert in
Koblenz, Germany. Here are eight of the tracks recorded at the event,
played by such truly international groups as the Kenny Clarke Trio and
the Bill Smith Quartet. Their contributions are completely eclipsed by
four numbers by a quintet jointly headed by saxophonist Don Byas and
pianist Bud Powell. Byas's languorous tenor on I Remember Clifford makes
the Benny Golson melody even more haunting than usual; while Powell's
majestic, but flawed, playing is featured on Round Midnight. An
interesting, though not essential, collection.
East Side, West Side: Kenny Davern and his Jazz Band (Arbors Jazz)
* EXCELLENT showcase for the superb clarinettist Kenny Davern, joined
by an equally peerless, piano-less group including Dan Barrett (cornet),
Joel Helleny (trombone), and Bucky Pizzarelli (guitar). Only complaint?
Not enough Davern, so generous has he been in giving out featured
numbers. His own are the best, especially Am I Blue, but Barrett and
Helleny's trombone duet of Sidewalks of New York is a definite
runner-up.

FIRST DIVISION
SAINTS or sinners? Manager Paul Sturrock is in no doubt about the
majority of his St Johnstone squad and is about to start to prove it
between now and the end of the season, starting at McDiarmid Park today
against Ayr United.
Sturrock was one of many who came up through the Jim McLean school of
excellence at Tannadice. It therefore comes as no surprise that his
skills off the field in a managerial role now match what he did on it.
However, there is a contradiction.
Take the happy side. His youth team have reached the final of the BP
Youth Cup after a penalty shoot-out against Hearts. Meanwhile, the
senior section, while only having lost once at home this season, seem to
have a form of travel sickness with only three wins in 15 away games.
''We will be taking stock of the situation,'' said Sturrock. ''There
has been quite a change in personnel here, but if we do not gain
promotion we will have a reduction in staff.''
Then came the warning about the success of his youth policy, and what
obviously will make the more senior members of the team extremely
uncomfortable. ''The team is showing a lack of character away from home.
We need more winners.''
Sturrock is taking consolation from the fact that today's
confrontation is at Perth, but those who take the field know that the
games away to Hamilton, Stranraer, and Dundee between now and the middle
of May are vital.
Back to the junior section, with 17-year-old defence-cum-midfielder
Stuart McCluskey being brought into the squad for today. Sturrock, as
befits his experience in the game, added: ''Nice boys don't win.''
Master McCluskey, no doubt, may back up his theory.
Another set of Saints, the Paisley brigade, travel to meet Dunfermline
without skipper Norrie McWhirter, Martin Baker and David Elliott -- all
injured. Saints have been battling to climb out of the relegation zone
and games between these two are always tight. Stay away from the
bookies.
At Broadwood, Airdrie take on Dundee, who will be without defender
Noel Blake, but will have full backs Mike Teasdale and Mike Hutchinson
back in the frame. Airdrie go with the squad who won against Ayr last
week.

HE WILL emerge this morning from Plainfield Prison, Indiana, to be
ambushed by media folk all wanting to know the answer to the same
question; when will Mike Tyson get back into the ring?
The morality of a convicted rapist being feted again as a prospective
sports star is a topic which will occupy much air time for months to
come but, as he is whisked off to the airport in a stretch limousine,
the former undisputed world heavyweight champion, having done his
three-year porridge, can be certain that his manager/promoter/alter ego,
Don King, that Guru of Excess, will lay before him a plan to guarantee
him megabucks.
It is already being said that the the most famous ex-con in the world
will be able to embark upon a #200m deal with an American cable TV
company, a strategy that will probably involve trawling the lower
ratings to reel in a collection of willing but mediocre big men as
practice tackle while Tyson gets rid of the ring rust that must have
gathered during his spell in the clink.
There are suggestions that the man who became the youngest ever
heavyweight champion of the world at 20 may not be too keen on returning
to the questionable scenario that is pro boxing at the top level because
he has been recently converted to Islam. His spiritual guide, Muhammad
Siddeeq, plans a prayer service soon after the former champ is released,
but there is no confirmation that Tyson has succumbed to this new
lifestyle.
At any rate, the man who will be under probation for four years has
been reported both as ''mad as hell'' and ''relaxed and confident''
during his confinement.
Either way, it will come as a startling surprise if he opts to keep
away from boxing, even if it is true that he has become a bibliophile of
some distinction in prison, reputedly having read Dumas, Maotse-Tung,
and Tolstoy, among others.
The fighter who once dominated the heavyweight scene as no other since
Muhammad Ali's great days has been keeping himself fit, running eight
miles a day, but his reputation does not seem to be concerning the bunch
of champs and challengers on the scene three years after his
disappearance. In fact, they seem to be queuing up for a chance to test
out his strengths.
Britain's best homespun heavyweight, Frank Bruno, is one of many
willing to meet the old champ (he put up a good show, although
eventually dumped, when they met before) but is not convinced that Tyson
can recapture the ferocity of his pre-jail fights.
''Prison does funny things to you,'' said Frank, ''but his spell
inside could have made him hungrier, more positive, and wiser. They said
he was slipping, anyway, before he went inside but he had a lot of
problems.''
One old-timer with designs on meeting the ex-con is 46-year-old George
Foreman who has recently emerged from his eventide home to lift the WBC
championship.
Foreman does not think the spell in jail will have done Iron Mike any
harm. ''Everybody deserves a second chance because America is the land
of the second chance,'' he said -- they do go on like that at times --
and added: ''When he gets out he will be a better fighter because,
hopefully, prison will have made him a better person.''
Foreman, who claims in all seriousness that his real job is as a
preacher, insists that one of his dreams is to meet Tyson in the ring.
''You can't make money preaching,'' he added, with scant disregard for
the litany of American preachers who have been in similar places to
Tyson after apparently managing that feat, ''so I box and I know there
is a lot of money to be made for Mike and myself if we meet.''
He may have to wait in the queue a wee while, because Oliver McCall,
the man who took the WBC title from Britain's Lennox Lewis, feels he is
due a shot soon.
Before then, McCall has to take on another of the old guard,
ex-champion Larry Holmes, who is a year younger than Foreman, in his
first defence of the WBC crown, in Las Vegas on April 8.
Riddick Bowe, who took the WBO version of the title when he beat
anothr Briton, Herbie Hide, has been to see Tyson in the nick and
discussed a meeting between the two who come from the same Brooklyn
ghetto.
The fact is that Tyson has not fought since winning a 12-round
decision over Razor Ruddock in 1991 and the memory of his knock-out
defeat by James 'Buster' Douglas a year-and-a-half earlier is still
vivid in many fans' minds.
Prisoner 922335 may be on the brink of a fortune but there is a posse
out there awaitin' for Michael. He'd better be in form.

ALAN Robson, who dropped himself from Racing Club's winning team in
the Scottish six-stage relay championships last Sunday, attempts to
regain the Alloa half marathon title tomorrow.
Robson, four-time winner of the event, faces Fife's Terry Mitchell,
the defending champion, plus two of his own clubmates, Davie Ross, a
member of last week's winning sextet, and his own brother, John, who was
unable to run because of a toe injury.
The women's crown could go to Aberdeen's US invader, Liz Reilly, whose
main challenge will come form two veterans, defending champion Jan
Stevenson (Falkirk) and former Scottish Peoples's Marathon winner Sandra
Branney (City of Glasgow). Both men and women are chasing a #150 prize,
with #75 for second and #50 for third.

SECOND AND THIRD DIVISIONS
JIM Leishman is back in senior football. The man who once reigned in
the kingdom of Fife as the Dunfermline manager is the new man in charge
of lowly Meadowbank Thistle, who are struggling for survival in the
second division.
Club chairman Bill Hunter explained that Meadowbank wanted a high
profile manager for the team's move next season to Livingston.
The extrovert Leishman certainly fits the bill. He led Dunfermline to
the old second-division championship nine years ago, and the Fifers
gained promotion to the premier division the following season. Their
attacking style contributed to a yo-yo period, but at least Leishman had
led them out of the wilderness and restored large gates to East End
Park.
It is hard to imagine comparable success in either respect for
Meadowbank and it would be a significant achievement if he were to save
them from relegation. Today's fixture is a tall order in itself as
Meadowbank are hosts to leaders Dumbarton, who have striker Charlie
Gibson doubtful. Cowden striker Willie Callaghan has moved to Meadowbank
in a deal worth about #12,000 and he therefore will play under Leishman
at their fourth club together.
Late goals could be a popular topic in the dressing rooms today, not
least at Ochilview. Following the loss of a last-minute equaliser to
Queen of the South in midweek, manager Terry Christie will remind his
Stenhousemuir players that matches last 90 minutes. Their visitors,
Brechin City, have even more cause for regret after having lost late
goals in successive weeks to Clyde and Morton, costing them three points
in the battle to avoid relegation.
Clyde and Stirling Albion are back in the promotion hunt, but really
have to win fixtures such as they have today, difficult though they are,
away to teams above them in the table who each have lost only once at
home. Jamie McCarron is doubtful as Clyde head for Berwick, who give a
let check to striker Warren Hawke, while Stirling have a full squad for
the trip to Greenock. Morton midfielder Alan Mahood is definitely ruled
out.
The third division's banker would appear to be at Firs Park. East
Stirlingshire beat Cowdenbeath 4-1 at Central Park in midweek and surely
ought to account for them at home. The Fifers, who have lost seven in a
row, have Gordon Winter suspended today. Mungo McCallum is ruled out for
'Shire -- but they shouldn't really need him, should they?

WENDY JACK on the joys of a custom-made work station
THE ever-growing contract culture, freelance working, call it what you
will, has brought sea changes far beyond the strict parameters of work.
Nowadays the workplace is increasingly likely to be home, and that can
bring a whole new set of dilemmas in its wake. Home and work, like bread
and butter, can be happily compatible, but it's also capable of having
all the harmony of oil and water.
To begin with, in many homes these days space is at a premium. This
can immediately create difficulties in finding an appropriate place in
which to work unless there is an easy solution like having a spare
bedroom available which can become a dedicated office.
For many people, however, using a room which has another function, a
living room or hall perhaps, is the only feasible option. The problem
is, how do you reasonably house all the working clobber and equipment
while avoiding turning your home into something which uncomfortably
resembles an office?
It's the kind of conundrum over which lots of people have chewed. Some
never quite solve it, staggering along with a series of unsatisfactory
solutions, odd desks, filing cabinets, cupboards, tables, while others
buy the kind of home work station advertised in business magazines and
catalogues, often finding them too cramped.
There is, however, an attractive alternative solution: commission a
furniture maker to design and build a home-friendly work station which
will sit happily within your house, aesthetically pleasing yet
fulfilling all the criteria needed to make an effective, efficient home
office. This is not the solution for anyone on a strictly limited
budget, but for those who can afford the price it can provide the most
practical and elegant solution. A space for everything, and everything
in its place.
Chris Clutterbuck is a furniture maker, or, as he prefers to call
himself, a cabinet maker. Trained in furniture design and craft at the
London College of Furniture, he worked for a wooden toy manufacturer and
later as a cabinet maker for more than a decade. Six years ago he
decided to go it alone and set up his own workshop in South-east
England. In more recent times he found himself the kind of farm he and
his wife Kirstin craved, in Banffshire.
A large converted barn has created an ideal workshop, with inspiration
provided by the views over Strath Isla and the surrounding hills.
High-quality furniture, from kitchen dressers and library units to
tables, chairs, and gun cabinets, mainly in hardwoods, is Clutterbuck's
speciality, made to the specification and design of his clientele. One
of this group, a woman who works at home, asked him to make her a work
station that would fulfil all the criteria: good looks married to the
practical needs of work, brought together in a piece of furniture that
would enhance any home.
What he came up with seems an ideal solution. Birch wood was the
timber used for this job -- eventually polished by Kirstin to a
wonderful silvery sheen. Clutterbuck created a central desk with a
raised shelf for a monitor and a pull-out drawer for the keyboard.
Flanking it to either side are tall, glazed-doored, shelved cupboards
with astragalled panes, with deeper cupboards below housing files and
with space for office equipment. At #3500 for this commission, not all
home workers could afford it, but as a legitimate piece of office
equipment the accountants will probably be happy to pass it as a
chargeable expense for tax purposes.

BRITAIN'S World Cross Country Championship preparations erupted in
acrimony last night in Durham. The two Scots in the team were denied
their rightful places on the start-line; Scottish officials protested at
being snubbed; and the team's most senior member claims the juniors have
been treated like second-class citizens.
Tommy Murray and Robert Quinn won their places in the nine-strong UK
men's team by finishing fourth and fifth in the trial. Yet last night UK
(i.e. English) officials insisted that Adrian Passey (who finished
behind them) and Andrew Pearson (who dropped out) would line up ahead of
them on the start-line, where competitors can be nine deep.
''We should not be shoved to the back of the pen to accommodate
so-called stars whom we beat fair and square,'' said Quinn. ''We are not
stars, but we have earned our place.''
Quinn, twentieth in the world event as a junior in 1984, before
requiring two pins in his leg following a motor bike accident in 1986,
is back in the UK team for the first time since. ''But I have not seen a
penny of the #30,000 set aside to help us prepare,'' he said.
Murray supported Quinn's comments. ''I've had just #100.''
Scottish road-running and cross-country commission convenor Bob
McSwein has complained over the British Athletic Federation's failure to
invite any Scottish delegates to the celebratory function. Only the
presence of Scottish secretary Bob Greenoak -- a coincidence following
his election to vice chairmanship of BAF last weekend -- has relieved
the situation.
But at least the senior competitors have appropriate clothing. Dave
Clarke, competing for the twelfth time, said: ''The juniors have gone to
train on the course with insufficient clothing. If you have trained hard
to make the world championships you should be kitted out properly --
every other team is. In 18 years competing for Britain I've had just
#200.''
The seniors were given track suits and wet suits, plus shorts and
singlets, but the junior men and women received vest and shorts only.
The lack of support explains the absence of many of the UK elite, but
there will be more pressing priorities today than sartorial elegance and
savaged egos.
Kenya's Rose Cheruiyot, last year's women's runner-up and this year's
favourite, warned that her country was going for what would be a unique
clean sweep: all four individual and team titles.
Derartu Tulu, Ethiopia's Olympic 10,000 champion, could spoil the
plan. So, too, could Ireland's Catherina McKiernan, runner-up for the
past three years, who has just returned from altitude training. But
don't bet on it.
* TOMMY Murray runs for Britain today in the World Cross-country
championships, but a week on Thursday he will be running for office in
the local government elections.
The three-time Scottish champion is standing as SDLP candidate in a
Greenock ward.

Paul Young revisits the Helmsdale, an angry torrent which holds a
special charm for him, and finds refreshment in its changing moods and
warmth in the good humour of his companions.
THE Helmsdale was in angry mood. The snow flurries came horizontally
down the Strath of Kildonan. My fingers had lost all feeling and I could
barely see the far bank of the river. The wind tore at the fly line,
making casting almost impossible for those whose technique is flawed
(me), and I gave the river best as I staggered to meet my companions at
the hut. And they call this ''spring'' fishing on the Queen of Rivers.
But, of all the rivers in the country, the Helmsdale holds a special
charm for me and, no matter the weather, I try like the devil to find
the time to fish my March week. Last year, work intervened, so it was
with an enthusiasm doubled by long separation that I looked forward to
fishing some of those world-famous pools . . . Torrish, Kilphedir,
Saluscraggie and the Manse, the Bend or Baddy Wood.
The river is divided roughly at the Falls of Kildonan into the six
upper and six lower beats. Two rods are allowed on each beat, and you
can both fish above, fish below, or have a rod on each. As you fish, the
beats rotate downstream each day, so in the course of your week you have
the opportunity to fish the whole river. In early March, though, the
water has not always reached around 40 degrees, the seemingly critical
temperature for fish to run the falls, so we tend to concentrate on the
lower river.
I was fishing with Ian Bain, newly arrived from Dubai where he had
left temperatures in the thirties. As the Sutherland week started, it
was still in the thirties, but Fahrenheit rather than Celsius. So Ian's
long-johns, thermal vest, and neoprene gloves were all deemed necessary.
The balaclava and the red woolly hat with ''HELMSDALE'' knitted on the
front were deemed the marks of a man bereft of taste, but allowed on
compassionate grounds.
Our superb gillie and friend, John Sutherland, more fondly known as
Johnnie Hardy, because he is, is an integral part of our Helmsdale days.
He is on the water from the opening of the season in early January until
fishing finishes at the end of September, and he regularly walks the
river and its tributaries before and after the rod fishing season. His
knowledge of the river and constant good humour add immeasurably to the
pleasure of fishing the Helmsdale.
Monday had been quite pleasant and we had taken a kelt or two from one
of the least fancied beats at this time of year, Beat Four. We fished
Stoney Point and Baddy Wood, where the Pulpit Stone still stands as a
reminder of the pre-Clearance days, from where the minister would preach
to the small community on the other side of the river. Ian had three
grilse kelts and for a moment I wasn't sure whether the surge of my
first fish was that of a springer, but it was another kelt, landed and
returned gently. After that, as they say in the hospital, no further
movements for the day.
Tuesday, the Queen was not amusing. The snow flurries etc, etc . . . a
wonderfully hellish day. We sat in the car for the first hour, waiting
for the snow to go. A phalanx of sheep passed close to the car and Ian
kept us amused with a Miss World-type commentary. ''Here's Miss Torrish.
Her ambition is to meet a kangaroo and start a family of woolly
jumpers.'' The snow abated and we went down to the river. We had a
couple of hours before the snow returned . . . no fish to report. Lunch,
more wind and cold fingers and an early exit, fishless. Lots of deer by
the river as we drove home.
Wednesday dawned bright on Kilphedir. A day of little to report
despite much walking and covering good water.
Thursday, and the weather was beautiful. Not a cloud in the sky, warm,
no jacket and the sunglasses on. Saluscraggie, a long pool, the left
bank right by the road. Ian and Johnnie crossed over to fish the head
and I tried the tail. 10.25, and a fish took. Not a normal kelt lie. The
fish turned deep golden in the peaty water, and I knew it was a
springer, a fresh fish. Johnnie bounded down the far bank, waded across
the river and, barely breathing heavily, netted it for me. Only my tenth
fish in 12 years of fishing this glorious river. A nine-pounder with no
sea-lice, but fresh, fresh, fresh.
We had our lunch by the roadside and as the sun streamed down, the
Greylag Geese honked their way past us, the train from Thurso came down
the Strath and a Hen Harrier quartered the far bank, Johnnie ventured
the thought that if the Good Lord had created anything better than this,
he had kept it for himself.
I could not but agree. The Queen of Rivers, perhaps not amused or
amusing at the beginning of the week, had deigned to bestow a favour on
me.
Long live the Queen, I say.

HIGH on a western island, you watch a family of swans travelling the
blue motorway of the sound below, cruising at a steady fifty in a rising
and falling line. It is a long road north in spring, 600 miles from the
lochs and winter wheatfields of Scotland to their breeding ground near
the Iceland glaciers. They will see hardly a human till they return to
us in October. Since the end of the last ice age opened the food larders
of the far north 10,000 years ago, the swans have made the same journey
in the same season.
For almost as long, Whoopers have flown through human legend. In the
old Celtic tale, the children of King Lir are turned into swans by a
jealous stepmother and wander the cold northern waterways for 900 years,
a ''tragedy greater than death''. Only when their beautiful singing
becomes Christian do they regain their human form to die. Close to, the
rising double note which gives the swans their name is coarse, but heard
across an icy loch or high above a highland strath it is evocative of
great distances in time and space.
Long before the children of Lir, Socrates believed that the swansong
at their death was a song of joy because they are going to meet their
god -- Apollo, who was also god of the Hyperboreans, the people from
beyond the north wind. As the migrating swans reach the end of the sound
they rise 100 feet or so to check their course. No-one knows how
migrating birds find their way. Are they migrating from memory, as we
do? They set straight for the distant line of Tiree, across the silver
ocean to the land beyond the north wind.

The runt he rescued on its way to the cat and dog home proved a great
companion for many years. But Jim Hewitson knew it couldn't last for
ever and now has only fond memories to remind him of his old friend.
FOR months, I'd known that this column would have to be written. Alas,
the dread day has arrived. Sam, our old Alsatian -- bought in a pub on
his way to the cat and dog home and brought to a life of unimagined
freedom in Orkney -- my companion of a thousand beachcombing
expeditions, has today gone to meet his pointy-eared ancestors.
For weeks, it had been obvious that he was failing. A leg injury
sustained in a sprint across the links after his ball had never repaired
itself, his joints were stiffening, he was deaf and his eyesight
failing. Although of an indeterminate age, Sam was probably at least 12
-- a good innings for the breed, the vet told us, comfortingly.
With his tawny and black coat, white muzzle, bushy tail and
intelligent, inquisitive eyes Sam had, in the past eight years, become a
familiar sight trotting by my side along the muddy tracks of Papa
Westray.
However, this winter gone were the days when he could leap like a fawn
into the back of the van. The westerly gales which he defied for years
now buffeted him mercilessly as he staggered across the field of
Sunnybraes on his morning walk. These walks, once long rambling affairs
by the tideline or along the marshy margin of the loch to St Tredwell's
chapel, had been curtailed to a quarter-mile trek to the Old Pier and a
sniff around the derelict farmyard at Nouster.
His days as top dog on Papay were in the past. Our sheep in the
10-acre field sensed the dog had weakened and the boldest of the bunch,
Nobby and Stephan Noir, began to square up to him and sent him hobbling
back to the gate. Alice's predator chickens seemed to know Sam was just
about past his sell-by date and instead of exploding in a flurry of
feathers as he rounded the corner of the byre at Geirbolls, they stood
their ground, pecking menacingly. Hell, even the gallus bunnies strolled
across his bow. A sair fecht for an old hound.
When the vet left School Place to catch the Westray boat, I carried my
pal round to the garden where we'd booked a spot for him in the shelter
of the west dyke, a few yards from where Clarissa our Vietnamese pig
lies and just across the way from the cats and Kay's pet Siamese rats,
Polly and Sybil. An icy wind whipped in over the kirk wall.
I remembered fondly Sam's arrival on Papay, stoating around the
car-park at the airstrip blootered by sedatives which had kept him calm
on the flight north from Edinburgh. I recalled the night he returned
home in North Berwick disgraced, having come off second-best in a fight
with a blind Labrador. Sam carried the scars of many a scrap. He loved
people and hated dogs.
In his early days on Papay, he would go off courting to nearby farms,
once chewing his way through our shed door to commence his amorous
exploits. On that occasion he turned up at North Rendall where Alice,
convinced he was a ''vicious killer'', refused to leave the house and
was rescued feeding him scraps through the kitchen window.
On another occasion he climbed unseen into the back seat of nurse
Fiona's car for a bit of hanky-panky with their Labrador Bess. A litter
of Albradors was expected.His amazing relationship with the seals in the
South Wick almost cost him his life on one occasion when he swam out
beyond Surhoosse Taing and only just made it back to shore. I wrote
about this and a Fleet Street paper wanted the affair restaged for the
benefit of the camera. We politely declined.
Small for an Alsatian, we always suspected that he was the runt of the
litter. Perhaps that was why, as a misfit, he found himself so much at
home in the occasionaly crazy, always confused life of the Hewitsons.
Small of stature he may have been but he was a brave heart.
One particular fierce January day we walked through a blizzard to
carry hay to our horses. The return leg was simply hellish. In whiteout
conditions, with the snow freezing on our faces and the initial sense of
adventure rapidly turning to genuine apprehension, Sam paced back and
forward, his coat caked by snow, shepherding the family through the
drifts and down the hill to the safety of School Place.
It's going to be strange not to hear his warning bark when Jim the
Postie turns up the track or to hear him reminding me that it's teatime
by playing keepy-upy with his tin bowl. Already his den under the stairs
looks awfy empty. Latterly he was slow, stubborn, and, it has to be
said, a bit smelly. But we're a big bunch and there's little time to
stop and stare -- horses wait for their hay, the donkey and goat will
want down from the manse field to their wee byre, and there's a wheen of
cats to be fed.
Already I know I'm going to be lost without my sidekick. But perhaps
from time to time I'll follow our well-worn tracks down the road,
through the fields, along the shore and pick up a sea-turned boulder or
two to place on his grave. Goodbye Sam, it was fun.

Lurking in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle, Liz Taylor finds a shop
that puts the shine back on things
''YOU should come back when we're silver-plating. It's like
Frankenstein's laboratory down there then,'' says Alan P Robertson (he
insists on the P) pointing to a wooden hatch in the floor of his shop.
The hatch, when opened, reveals a steep stair down to the basement of
Robertson's premises, the Economic Electro-plating Company at Johnstone
Terrace in Edinburgh, in the shadow of the castle. It is one of the last
places in the country where people can take pieces of tarnished or
damaged brass, copper, silver, or gold plate for a complete renovation
service. The company has a staff of five.
Alan P Robertson's business has been in operation since 1887, and his
family have owned it since the Second World War. His wife, Ada, has
presided over the front counter for almost 40 years.
On the day I called there were paper-wrapped packets of brass stair
rods; two enormous brass chandeliers with inverted flower beds for the
light bulbs that belong to Edinburgh Castle; a brass lectern from a
church; several bronze bowls; a masterly bronze plaque showing a stag at
bay; a Chinese bronze bowl decorated with relief reeds and flowers; and
several Victorian tea services.
''Doing up granny's old teapot is among our most popular
commissions,'' says Ada Robertson, passing one gleaming example over for
inspection. ''Didn't they have big sugar bowls then? They must have used
far more sugar than we do.''
The shop has an out-of-time, olde-world atmosphere with its blue and
white paint and utilitarian wooden counter on one end of which stands a
burnished bronze till with the words ''Dayton, Ohio'' embossed on a
plaque on its back. Every now and again white-overalled workmen with
blackened faces rush through on their way to the basement premises. It
is easy to imagine that nothing has changed there since the days of
Queen Victoria.
Commissions brought to Economic Electro-plating range from the rare
and expensive to the commonplace. They have recently restored a huge
brass lantern from Holyrood House and gold-plated the Freedom Casket
that the City of Aberdeen presented this year to Aberdeen University to
mark its 500th anniversary.
A regular client was Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, who went to the Johnstone
Terrace shop to have the polish on the silver buckles on his shoes kept
as bright as new. The Robertsons speak fondly of him as one of their
favourite customers.
Another cherished customer was an American lawyer who, until he died,
made a regular pilgrimage to Edinburgh with all his silver to have it
kept pristine by Alan P Robertson.
When I was in the shop an old lady came in with two brass candlesticks
in the shape of hooded cobras. She wanted them treated because she was
going to give them to a relative ''and she doesn't want to have to
polish them like I've done for the past 50 years'', she said.
There, in a huge vat of silver cyanide solution, every three weeks or
so they restore silver by the process of metal deposition by
electrolysis and bring it back to its original beauty.
''People are always delighted when they get their things back because
they look like new when we're finished with them,'' says Ada Robertson
proudly.
* The Economic Electro-plating Company is at 3 Johnston Terrace,
Edinburgh, Tel: 0131-225 6587.

Jimmy Logan could not resist a special offer that gave him the chance
to live in state at Culzean for five years.
AS A life member of the National Trust for Scotland for more than 30
years I have often visited some of the beautiful homes and properties
and wondered what it would be like to live in one of them.
In 1965 I was flying back from America where I had just finished my
fourth coast-to-coast tour and I had a great longing to live in the
country, in Scotland, when I read in the flight magazine that the trust
had completed the restoration of a wing at Culzean Castle and were going
to lease it for five years. As soon as we landed I made an appointment
to see the wing.
Before we had looked at all the rooms (and there were 16 with four
bathrooms) I knew that, mad though it may seem, this was where I wanted
to live.
During the five years I was able to invite many friends like Tony
Bennett who left his heart in San Francisco, but not all of it. Some of
his heart he left at Culzean Castle. Tony was touring with Count Basie
and his Orchestra and I invited him to stay at Culzean.
Although it was July I told Mrs Duncan the housekeeper to put the
heating on. This involved putting on 35 off-peak heaters -- yes 35! --
but Tony was used to American heating and I didn't want this wonderful
singer catching a cold in Scotland.
When Tony arrived Mrs Duncan said: ''Are you Mr Bennett?'' Tony said:
''Yeah.'' ''The singer?'' ''Yeah, that's me, why?'' and Mrs Duncan said:
''Well, Mr Bennett, when I was told to put the heating on in July, I
thought it must be either Africans or heathens that were coming.'' Tony
wanted to take her back to America!
But Tony Bennett is also a fine painter and from the first window he
looked out of he saw, to his delight, a school of 20 painters at work
painting that lovely view of the Clyde. Tony took one look at the
scenery and fell in love with this beautiful part of Ayrshire.
Another friend was my neighbour in Glasgow, Dr Hector MacLennan. A
great Scot, a fine doctor, and an outstanding gynaecologist who was
overworking -- so, one weekend, the two of us slipped away to Culzean
and although it was the tail-end of the winter and the winds were
howling, the walls were thick, so we were settled with two large
whiskies and a nice fire, when the phone rang. Diane Wilson and her
husband Alec lived at the courtyard entance and she explained that her
dog was having pups and Alec was out. Could I help? ''Of course,'' I
said, ''I'll send someone round right away.''
Hector was stunned. ''Jimmy, I don't know anything about dogs having
pups.'' ''You don't need to know, Hector,'' I said. ''Just give the
woman some confidence.''
Next day Diane phoned and said: ''Will you thank your friend?'' I
said: ''Tell your dog she has had Sir Hector MacLennan, President of the
Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists for Great Britain and
the Commonwealth, at the birth of her pups and she is lucky we are not
sending in a bill.''
My interest in the castle led me to New York and a meeting in the
Waldorf Astoria Hotel with President Eisenhower. As I walked into the
room ''Ike'' stood up and seemed to drop 20 years from his age. He
mentioned all the staff at Culzean by name and it was obvious he was
proud of the tribute that had been paid to him on behalf of the people
of Scotland in his life tenure of the upper floor of the castle.
He was very interested in my idea of an area in the castle that would
reflect his great contribution to the Second World War. The President
suggested that the British Government might give replicas of his awards
and was proud that he was the only man to hold the medals of the US 1st
Army and the British 8th Army. He mentioned for example, his robes from
St Andrews. As I left he said: ''We've got to do something, Mr Logan --
after all, I am an honorary member of the Maybole Pipe Band.''
I thought for a moment I saw a hint of laughter in his eyes.
It is worth mentioning that during his visits to Culzean as President
Eisenhower this ancient Scottish castle became for a time the White
House of the United States of America.
Culzean was never mine. I shared it with thousands of visitors who
were so thrilled at being there and although some knew nothing of
Georgian architecture, and were seeing it for the first time, they
reacted with a sense of sheer pleasure that was a joy to share.
If the purpose of the trust is to preserve the great treasures of
Scotland for the people to love and appreciate, it is there at Culzean.

SCOTLAND striker Duncan Ferguson's injury call-off from the match
against Russia will today deny Fort William the support of their most
famous fan in their first cup final as a Highland League club.
Duncan Shearer had told Fort manager Henrick Madej he would be there
to cheer on his home-town club against Lossiemouth -- unless he was
called up by Craig Brown.
But that call came when Ferguson's injury ruled him out and now
Shearer's thoughts will wander away to the McEwan's North Cup final even
as he prepares for Moscow.
Strengthening Shearer's Lochaber link is the fact that his brother,
Finlay, will spearhead the Fort strike-force.
A fleet of buses and cars will leave Fort William and Lossiemouth with
supporters unused to success heading for the final at neutral Forres.
Fort won their last seven finals in their last two seasons as a
non-league side, but have never reached a final since joining the
Highland League in 1985.
Lossiemouth are out to end an even longer wait for silverware -- their
last trophy was the Highland League Cup in 1961-62. Lossie have no new
injury problems while Fort's Alan Murdoch has a slight knock but should
be okay.

MISTER Fire Eyes looks one of the first outstanding bets of the new
Flat turf season in the Northern Handicap at Doncaster today.
Clive Brittain has saddled winners on both of Doncaster's opening
days, adding to the fine form his stable has displayed during the winter
on the all-weather.
Mister Fire Eyes contributed to this with three wins on sand. Indeed,
the three-year-old has not looked back since winning on turf at
Folkestone in November.
But he remains handicapped on his form on grass, which means he comes
here on a 15lb lower mark than when scoring at Wolverhampton last month.
Add to that the fact that he is an improving horse who was felt by
connections to have needed his Wolverhampton run, and Mister Fire Eyes
looks to have been gifted a golden opportunity to extend his winning
sequence to five.
Punters should take an early price as he looks sure to be a popular
order.
In the feature race, Mellottie can master his younger rivals in the
Lincoln Handicap.
It would be easy to be put off the 10-year-old on grounds of age but
Mellottie has had a far from orthodox career and did not really peak
until he reached seven.
He had his first winnerless campaign last term but showed enough to
suggest he retains ability.
At Lingfield, Camden's Ransom can give Hamish Rowsell his biggest
winner to date by landing the Daily Star AWT Challenge Final.
Rowsell has a good pedigree for training, having worked for Andy
Turnell, Toby Balding, Bill Wightman, and a spell with Jonathan Sheppard
in the USS.

CONFUSION reigned at Kelso yesterday after the cup event.
It looked as though the race would be declared void -- as happened
following a novice chase here in 1993 -- after the fatal fall of Eastern
Oasis.
When the survivors came round again, they were confronted with a
course employee waving a warning flag, cones on the ground, and three
discs on top of the fence.
All bar two of the runners jumped the fence, and the race continued,
with Pims Gunner eventually beating Silver Stick.
The riders of Ceilidh Boy (Richard Guest) and Side of Hill (Fraser
Perratt) pulled up in the confusion following the incident and were
interviewed at length by the stewards, but it was soon announced that
the result would stand.

MAHOOL, beaten favourite in last year's William Hill Lincoln Handicap,
can take today's renewal at much more attractive odds.
After having tried to make all last April, he faded in the last
furlong to finish ninth, but a change of tactics can produce better
results this afternoon.
He was held up before swooping to head Jawaal at Kempton in July and
that rival was narrowly beaten next time out in Goodwood's Golden Mile.
Although Castel Rosselo is a recent winner, Mahool runs off the same
mark as when winning easily at Sandown in the summer, and he can take
full advantage.
Bagshot did all his best work at the end of last season, but trainer
Richard Hannon can be relied upon to have him ready for this test and he
merits each-way support.
Khamaseen could make a return to the winner's enclosure after the
Doncaster Shield. Lester Piggott gave this son of Slip Anchor a terrific
ride when fifth behind Erhaab in the Derby, and although the selection
has shown little in his two runs since, a long lay-off should have
revived his enthusiasm.
He won first time out last season and gets weight from principal rival
Cotteir Chief.
Juyush is fancied to land the third race on the card and sustain the
promise of his two-year-old season. After a close second to Eltish (who
then scored at Goodwood's July meeting), he won at Ascot and ran third
to the much talked-about Derby favourite, Celtic Swing, on this course
in the Racing Post Trophy. A winning appearance looks on the cards.
Jump racing continues at Newbury. The main event, named after Brown
Chamberlin, can go to Grange Brake, an excellent fourth to Rough West at
Cheltenham when having his first run for six months. He should be too
quick and too fresh for veteran Willsford.
Muntafi is by Unfuwain out of a mare by Roberto making him one of the
most classily bred hurdlers around. He has won twice already this year
and can improve enough to take the opener.
* SHARP Prospect landed a gamble in the Lincoln consolation race at
Doncaster yesterday. Backed down to 8-1 after having been available at
14-1, the five-year-old justified the backing in style in the Spring
Mile.
Travelling well in behind the leaders, Sharp Prospect was unleashed by
Richard Quinn just inside the final furlong and quickened away to defeat
Set Table by three lengths.
The victory demonstrated trainer Reg Akehurst's skill at rejuvenating
a cast-off from another stable. Sharp Prospect was sent to the Epsom
trainer in December having been with Peter Harris.
Clive Brittain registered his second success of the new turf season as
Upper Mount Clair popped up in the Cystic Fibrosis Research Cup.

IT is decision time in the Scottish men's first division tomorrow with
Glasgow Brightsiders playing hosts to champions Livingston Bulls at
Easterhouse Sports Centre.
Victory by just three points will give Glasgow the title for the first
time, but they will have to overcome memories of how they surrendered a
big lead and eventually lost by two points in the sides' first encounter
last November.
However, coach James McKechnie claims his biggest worry is how all the
supporters are going to get into the Easterhouse centre. ''If everyone
comes who says he's coming, I don't know what we'll do,'' he commented.
Any disappointed spectators will have a second chance when the two
sides meet again in the Scottish Cup final at Meadowbank on April 2.
Brightsiders have already made sure of winning two titles this season,
their juniors capturing the Bank of Scotland league title last weekend
to add to the Scottish under-23 title.

IAIN Grubb hopes to add another medal to his collection tomorrow, when
Glasgow Ragazzi face Kilmarnock in the final of the Royal Bank Scottish
Cup at Meadowbank.
Volleyball is all-consuming for 26-year-old Grubb, who trains four or
five nights a week, has a full-time job in the sport (as volleyball
development officer with Glasgow District Council) and has even married
a volleyball internationalist, Sandra.
Under coach Tommy Dowens Ragazzi have almost outgrown Scotland, yet
when they played in the European Champions' Cup for the first time last
autumn, they found they were out of their depth. ''I think only one of
our matches has lasted more than an hour this season in the league,''
said Grubb. ''It is too big a step for us to make to play in Europe if
we are not tested at home.''
So, is there a danger of complacency tomorrow? ''Not with Tommy as our
coach. Anyway, Sandra has four cup winners' medals and, if we win, I
will have three, so I'm determined to narrow the gap.''

Kennedy Wilson on a cool new fridge
ALTHOUGH fridges were manufactured before the First World War it was
not until the 1920s that they were perfected. It was thanks to an
American that refrigerators evolved from varnished wooden cabinets to
hard, white steel boxes.
In the 1930s Raymond Lowey, the American design master who streamlined
the Coke bottle, brought a touch of the automobile to fridges. Lowey's
dramatic curved edges of the 1935 Coldspot fridge helped make it a
design classic.
It was Lowey who helped make all fridges white, conveying an image of
utter cleanliness. Up until the 1950s fridges were a real luxury in
Britain while in the US as early as 1952 the fridge, or icebox as
Americans still call it, was voted the most popular appliance in the
American home.
For too long the functional fridge has been designed as an anonymous
white box. Like so many other home appliances the fridge has become a
heartless, soulless machine. Until now.
If you have the cash you can make a real design statement in your
kitchen with the Boxy fridge-freezer from Italian company Arc Linea. The
Boxy is tall with soft, round edges. Its dimensions are 168cm high by
72cm wide and 67.5cm deep.
The Boxy looks like a kind of elegant version of the sort of
super-fridge you might expect to see in the kitchen in TV's The Wonder
Years. It is available in white and pastel kitchen colours as well as
vivid mandarin orange and marine blue. There's also a delicious version
in burnished industrial stainless steel.
The stainless steel Boxy is by far the most popular, says Arc Linea's
Celia Warbrick: ''The Boxy is manufactured by Whirlpool, so it has a
worldwide guarantee. A lot of the fridges that go into fitted kitchens
today are integrated. The Boxy is freestanding. It's not just a
fridge-freezer, it's a fantastic looking piece of furniture. It's
unusual to get a free-standing piece that looks aesthetically pleasing
on its own. It's also colour co-ordinated to match our kitchens, but you
can buy it separately.''
* The Boxy fridge-freezer costs #1950. Contact Arc Linea, 164 Brompton
Road, Knightsbridge, London SW3 1HW (0171-581 2271) for nearest
stockist.

AUSTRALIA coach Bob Dwyer believes that the bookmakers have got it
wrong in naming his side as favourites for the Rugby World Cup in South
Africa.
''England's recent performances have been outstanding,'' said Dwyer.
''They came within a whisker of winning the title last time, but now
they are a more complete team.
''They showed tremendous urgency recently against Scotland and, like
all good teams, they are strong in all areas.''
Dwyer will be able to gauge Australia's prospects when he brings his
players together next month for the two-test home series against
Argentina.
The Australian side, with the exception of scrum half George Gregan,
are playing in the Super Ten provincial tournament for either New South
Wales or Queensland, but reports filtering back to Dwyer have been
mixed.
While Queensland, the defending Super Ten champions, remain unbeaten,
New South Wales have struggled.
Overall, Dwyer has been disappointed with the form and commitment of
several of his test regulars. Without naming individuals, he has made
his concerns plain by publicly canvassing the possibility of team
changes before the World Cup.
''Some individuals have been showing poor form and there would be a
few disappointed people if I picked the test team today based on current
form,'' Dwyer said. ''But I'm not about to commit suicide because we
have a long way to go before the World Cup.''

EUROPEAN Tour professionals Derrick Cooper and Richard Boxall, playing
superbly all day, won the Sunningdale Foursomes for the second time in
four years yesterday.

Tracey Craik, of Frilford Heath, 5 and 3 in the semi-finals, and five
under par for 17 holes in defeating Malcolm and Iain Mackenzie of
Sheffield 2 and 1 in the final.
In 32 holes they had only one bogey as they became the fifth pair in
the history of the competition to win the title twice.
''We've been winners twice and quarter-finalists twice in six
attempts,'' said Cooper. ''We'll be back next year to see if we can set
a record.'' Results:
Semi-finals -- I Mackenzie (Hallamshire) and M Mackenzie
(Hillsborough) (+1) beat J Little (Moor Park) and G Evans (Ealing)
(scr), 3 and 2; D Cooper (Birchwood) and R Boxall (Camberley Heath) (+2)

Helen Brown finds an unusual and stimulating selection of home-grown
crafts to lift the tone of that jaded wedding list
WELL-MEANT wedding gifts can lead to a sense of growing despair as the
decanters, toasters, candlesticks pile skywards. If you have lived
together for a while or this is the second time around and your house is
very nicely stocked with life's essentials thank you very much, why not
turn your thoughts to something altogether more aesthetic and,
incidentally, purely Scottish?
Amos Haniff, the architectural and interior design practice based in
Edinburgh's St Stephen Street is -- most unusually -- fronted by a small
craft gallery. Makers featured are all Scots or based in Scotland. Most
of them -- like Haniff and his partners Fergus Craig and Lynne Cranston
-- are graduates of the four art colleges. A stroll around the colourful
and slightly quirky shop may spark those wedding gift ideas and
Cranston, who takes care of the shop, will be happy to draw up and
manage your list.
Haniff and Craig met when they worked together on the design team at
Saltire Court, the building that filled Edinburgh's notorious hole in
the ground. Sharing common ideals, they took the big step of setting up
in business together, with Lynne Cranston as third partner.
Much of their interior design work has been for commercial clients,
but they enjoy undertaking commissions on a domestic scale also.
''We are often asked to design and make furniture,'' says Haniff.
''You may have to spend a little more than you would if you went to a
high street retail chain and bought off the shelf, but you will get
something unique and specially designed for your needs.''
The partners have gathered together a team of craftsmen including
metal workers, cabinet makers, decorators skilled in such arts as rag
rolling, sponging, and dragging and other special paint effects,
stained-glass artists, wood turners, and glass blowers through shop
sales.
''Many people are afraid that they will find commissioning interior
design work very expensive,'' says Haniff. ''In fact many of our clients
come through the door for the first time when they are looking at new
kitchens. We don't stock kitchens -- but they end up talking to us about
other needs. It's just that kitchens seem to be the only room that most
people are prepared to spend money on.''
If you are not looking for wholesale redecoration but simply for small
gifts or purchases -- or those wedding list ideas -- you could do no
better than browse around the shop. Mags Chalcroft's jauntily decorated
crockery ranges in price from #8 for a mug to #38 for teapots.
Dalton Ceramics of Dumfries has delightful toothbrush holders which
stick to the wall with glued pads and Velcro; these come in colourful
fish shapes and in charming his-and-her figures that clutch the
toothbrushes possessively. Both sets are #18 the pair.
Dalton also produces a boxed set of ''tartan'' ceramic napkin rings at
#35 for the set of six, tartan vases (#35) and assorted dishes from #19
to #49.
In the glass line, you might enjoy Adrienne McStay's witty Dancers
(floaty red figures supporting the goblet) at #37.50, or her cocktail
glasses which come complete with swizzle sticks decorated with lifelike
glass olives, also at #37.50.
There is a good choice of mirrors. Jane Phillips's small wall mirrors
framed by paper pulp, but heavily enough varnished to be usable in high
steam areas like bathrooms, cost around #25 to #50. Jane can match more
or less any colour on request, so if you have a particularly difficult
room bring in a sample of wallpaper or fabric for her to work from.
Lansdowne mirrors use a quaint decoupage method of decoration using
old 1920s and thirties scrapbook figures of little girls and cherubs to
create a most unusual feature. These cost #17 for the small size.
Tiles, turned wood, CD stands, clocks, lamp bases and shades, fire
screens and room screens -- you will find an unusual and stimulating
selection here. A visit could unlock ideas you never knew you had.

MARK Mouland moved closer to his first European Tour victory for seven
years in Majorca yesterday. The 33-year-old Welshman added a 69 to his
opening 67 and on the halfway total of 136, eight under par, leads the
#250,000 Turespana Balearic Open at Santa Ponsa by two strokes from
Italian Costantino Rocca.
Out at the start of the day, Mouland had four birdies in his first 10
holes and was hoping to set a daunting target of at least 10 under for
the others to chase. ''Then it just went wrong,'' said the
Kenilworth-based player, whose career has nosedived since he won the
1988 Dutch Open.
Further birdie chances were missed and at the last -- a par-3 with an
island green in the shape of Majorca -- he three-putted for a bogey 4.
It is his putting, however, that is bringing about this revival.
''I've been dreadful for the last five years, but I've a friend with
me this week (five-handicapper Steve Millichip) and he spotted that I
was moving my head,'' said Mouland.
Rocca, who dropped from joint first to tenth with a closing 75 in the
Portuguese Open last Sunday, put that memory behind him with a 67 which
included a left-handed shot from a bush at the long eighth, his
seventeenth.
The attempted recovery rebounded off a tree, but he made a curling
15-footer for his par-5 and holed from 10 feet at the last.
Four Scots made the cut, and they were led by Scottish Professional
champion Andrew Coltart, who shot a 69 yesterday for 143, one ahead of
Stephen McAllister. Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
136 -- M Mouland 67, 69.
138 -- C Rocca (Italy) 71, 67.

IRELAND and England have, down through the years, been the dominating
forces at youth level in men's hockey, and so it was again at Newport in
Wales on the opening day of the Four Nations tournament as they disputed
the leadership in both the under-16 and under-18 events.
The best Scottish performance was at under-18 level. They were beaten
2-0 by defending champions Ireland, but matched their opponents in most
phases of the game -- with one notable exception.
That was at set-pieces, which produced both Irish goals. The first
came from a penalty corner after 12 minutes by Dowie Holley and from a
penalty 10 minutes from time by Darren McBride.
Gavin Fraser, the Scottish coach, while disappointed, said: ''I am
well satisfied with the team's commitment.'' He picked out Alistair
Fraser, Andrew Balchin, Darren Jefferys and Ross MacPherson, on his
international debut, as Scotland's best players.
The manager of the Scottish under-16 side, Keith Joss, had high hopes
for his team prior to the tournament, but they were soundly beat 6-0 by
Ireland.
Their main failings were an inability to concentrate for the full 70
minutes and their defending at penalty corners, which produced
two-thirds of the Irish goal tally.
England began their defence of the under-16 title by beating Wales
7-1, and in the senior game England were even more impressive, winning
8-1.

LIKE their male counterparts before them, Scotland's women's team at
the Bank of Scotland World Junior championships in Perth lost their
unbeaten record at the last hurdle yesterday, going down 7-6 to Sweden.
Sweden are now became the only unbeaten team and qualify for today's
semi-finals at the top of the rankings.
The Scots won the toss and scored 2 at the first end. Sweden countered
with a single at the second end, and then Scotland moved further ahead
with another 2 at the third, but the tide turned in the fourth.
Ewart wrecked on a Swedish guard and then their skip took out the
exposed Scottish shot stone. Ewart was slightly short with her second
and this left Sweden with a hit and lie to count 3.
The Scots blanked the next two ends and then scored 2 in the seventh,
but Swedish singles in the last three ends of the game were enough to
give them victory.
Scotland face Canada in this morning's semi-final, while Sweden are up
against Switzerland. The The Scottish men are in semi-final action
against Sweden, and the winner will face either Canada or Germany in
tomorrow evening's final.
Women. Round 9 -- Canada 6, Switzerland 4; Sweden 7, Scotland 6; Japan
3; USA 7; Germany 8, Norway 7; Czech Republic 1, Denmark 18.
Rankings: Sweden 9 wins, 0 losses; Scotland 8-1; Canada 7-2;
Switzerland 5-4; Germany 5-4; USA 3-6; Japan 3-6; Norway 2-7; Denmark
2-7; Czech Republic 1-8.
Play-offs -- Germany 5, Switzerland 7 (Switzerland qualify for
semi-finals); Norway 5, Denmark 1 (Norway pre-qualify for next year's
event).

FORMULA ONE: BRAZIL GRAND PRIX
BRITAIN'S Damon Hill took command on the opening day of the 1995
Formula One season today -- with world champion Michael Schumacher lucky
to escape unhurt from a high-speed crash which may rule out the Benetton
team this weekend.
Hill, in a Renault-powered Williams, grabbed provisional pole position
for tomorrow's season-opening Brazilian Grand Prix in dominant style,
clocking a fastest lap of 1min 21.364sec and then trimming it down to
1:20.081 on the 2.637-mile Interlagos circuit.
For Hill, it was a perfect start to his campaign to take the
championship he lost so narrowly to Schumacher last year and he was able
to enjoy a comfortable supremacy over the 26-year-old German -- and his
young team-mate and fellow Briton David Coulthard.
At the end of the session, Hill finished up comfortably the fastest
ahead of Austrian Gerhard Berger in a Ferrari, who clocked 1:21.015, and
Coulthard who recorded a best lap time of 1:21.343.
Schumacher, though, lost control of his car after 40 minutes of the
one-hour session, running wide on some grass and then spinning heavily
into a wall of tyres on the approach to the deep right-hand Pinheirinho
corner.
It was a spectacular accident, but Schumacher was able to leap from
the damaged car and walk away uninjured after the crash at about 111
miles per hour. He finished sixth-quickest at the end of the session
during which he suffered more psychological damage than anything else.
Schumacher said later, in an interview with German television, that it
was possible the Benetton team might have to pull out of the rest of the
weekend if the exact cause of the accident could not be explained and
solved.
His British team-mate Johnny Herbert did not get to practice at all
due to the crash as Schumacher said: ''I lost the steering and the car
ran wide. I had no control and I went straight on. I spun it around by
braking in the corner and luckily I went backwards into the tyre wall.
''The new safety structure, which was developed over the winter,
worked well. But as to why I had no steering, we are still
investigating. Possibly it was a broken steering link -- that is why
Johnny did not go out to practise at all.''
Benetton team boss Flavio Briatore later played down the possibility
that the team would have to withdraw.
Hill was delighted with the way events worked out, and said: ''It's
bad luck for Michael, isn't it? It's especially nice to have a
two-second advantage on your biggest rival.
''I couldn't have asked for a more perfect start. The car felt good,
it was well balanced and we showed some true form. I just feel relieved
now that it has all come together.''
Berger and fourth-placed Jean Alesi were delighted, particularly as
Ferrari had had problems in pre-season testing and preparations.
Coulthard was disappointed not to have done better than third place
overnight on his first visit to Interlagos. ''I would have preferred to
have been second, especially when you look at the job Damon has been
able to do,'' he said.
Like all the drivers, Coulthard complained about the bumpy surface of
the Interlagos track. Times:
1, D Hill (GB) Williams 1min 20.081sec (average speed 194.428 kph); 2,
G Berger (Austria) Ferrari 1:21.015; 3, D Coulthard (GB) Williams

* NIGEL Mansell, already forced to sit out the first two races of the
campaign, could also miss the San Marino Grand Prix -- and may quit the
entire championship.
Engineers are frantically working on a new chassis after the
41-year-old former world champion revealed he felt too cramped in the
cockpit of his McLaren-Mercedes after testing at Estoril, Portugal,
earlier this month.
Fellow-Briton Mark Blundell will replace Mansell tomorrow and
Argentina a fortnight later -- and according to reports on Radio Five
Live, is being lined up to take Mansell's place at the Imola circuit on
April 30.

Ski clothing can be as much a fashion statement as protection against
the elements. However, good looks without good performance are of little
use on Scotland's perishing pistes. We sent five skiers out with a
selection of popular ski wear to find out just how effective it was.
SOS jacket (#280) and salopettes (#199).
Tested by Fergus Wyllie, journalist. 6ft. Usually wears Killy
one-piece suit or Fubar jacket and salopettes.
I MUST confess I have long been an admirer of Sportwear of Sweden ski
clothing. It looks great in a quiet, understated way and has a
reputation for working very effectively. The navy blue and yellow
insulated jacket I tested certainly kept me warm on Cairngorm when the
temperature hit -8[DEG]C and I had only a thermal vest and cotton
polo-neck underneath.
The navy blue salopettes were even warmer and I probably could have
done without my thermal long johns. I could not feel the wind through
the insulated salopettes, which are trouser not bib-and-brace style,
although the icy blast did touch my lower rib cage. However, I had
failed to notice a draw string in the elasticated waist which would
probably have cured the problem.
Believe it or not, it did not rain or sleet on the two days I skied in
the clothing but it is coated with Entrant GII, an improved version of
the wizard stuff that does a very good job of keeping water out of my
Killy suit.
The attention to detail is a hallmark of SOS. The jacket comes with a
heavy, stud-on hood and there is another, much lighter hood concealed in
a zipped pocket under the collar. There are zips under the arms to
provide ventilation on warm days and I just love the little pocket below
the right knee of the salopettes. I don't know what it is for but I just
love it.
There were enough pockets even for someone like me who carries
everything but the kitchen sink. The heavy, well-covered zips were
slightly stiff but I put that down to being new. The jacket cuffs are
fastened by a choice of three studs which form an effective seal but
make it very difficult to look at your watch. One thing missing from the
salopettes was protectors from ski edges which will result in cuts at
the bottom of the inside leg sooner or later.
The matt, canvas-like finish of the material and limited but effective
use of bright colours, particularly on the zip tags, make this a very
attractive outfit with classic style. It is not cheap at just under #500
but is definitely top quality.
Phoenix Black Diamond jacket (#290) and Spindripht salopettes (#180).
Tested by John Flynn, ski instructor. 5ft 7in. Usually wears Nevica
one-piece instructor's suit or Peak Performance two-piece suit.
THE shell jacket is made of Goretex to keep out the extreme weather
conditions braved by Scottish skiers. The outer material is a
good-grade, hard-wearing, cotton-like fabric and the inner is a mesh
which allows moisture from sweat to pass through the Goretex membrane.
I discovered its excellent wind-cheating qualities when I was stuck on
Cairngorm's West Wall chairlift for 20 minutes. It kept me warm in what
were awful conditions.
The two main waist-height pockets are awkward to open because they are
protected by a storm flap. The zips are also very fine and can catch the
pocket material. However, the two lapel pockets are well-placed,
well-protected, and a decent size. The hood folds into the collar and
provides easy access and wrap-around protection. There is also an
internal waist garter to stop wind and snow blowing in. The easily
adjusted cuff flaps work very well.
The jacket is not waisted and is cut quite straight from shoulders to
hips. This is not ideal for teaching as it makes it difficult to show
body movement. However, its length does keep those lower parts out of
the wind and warm.
The lined, shell salopettes have full-length zips on the outside leg,
making them very easy to get in and out of and to ventilate on a warm
day. There was plenty of room for my thermal long johns and thick
tracksuit bottoms with no resulting bagginess. Although the pockets are
a little shallow, the ski-edge protector is good and the salopettes were
very warm and windproof.
Although the quality of the garments is excellent and they work very
well, I feel they are slightly expensive for a shell.
Columbia Bugaboo jacket (#150) and Bugabib salopettes (#70).
Lowe Alpine Juneau jacket (#140).
Tested by Jennifer Cunningham, journalist. 5ft 7in. Usually wears a
Nevica one-piece.
FOUNDED by refugees from Nazi Germany, Columbia Sportswear combines
Teutonic technical expertise with American panache. The practical
intelligences which so endear outdoor kit to its wearers are all there:
tagged zips, adjustable cuffs, accessible pockets. Proof that they know
their market is in the six-page homily with each garment from ''Mother''
Gert Boyle, a Mrs Doubtfire lookalike who is chairman of the company.
Dear Gert,
I hae long been a convert to the draught-excluding, streamlined
comfort of one-piece outfits, but the disadvantage is that on a warm
spring day you cannot take off the jacket. Your Bugaboo, combining a
warm fleece with a waterproof shell, to give a choice of three separate
jackets, is a tempting alternative. Securely linked with inside zips and
sleeve fasteners, the double jacket is more comfortable than wearing a
separate jacket over a fleece.
The bulkiness of the jacket and trouser combination has been minimised
by elasticated side panels giving both flexibility and neatness to the
waist-high salopettes. On a mild day it more than passed warmth and
waterproof tests.
I think your patented Interchange zip system is long-overdue, applied
common sense and the tags on the zip-ends are what your fellow-Americans
would call neat. The trouser material is rather easily sliced by skis,
though -- just as well you have generous protector patches.
In Europe, Gert, we find electric blue and fuschia pink a rather loud
combination. While the verstaility of the Bugaboo meets all the
requirements of the unpredictable Scottish weather, to wear it in
Glencoe is a bit like planting a tropical orchid amid the heather; could
your state of the art design technology combine two quieter colours?
By comparison Lowe Alpine's Juneau jacket is understated practicality.
Lightweight but thoroughly wind and rain-proof, with a guarantee for the
breathing and rain-shedding powers of its triplepoint ceramic fabric, it
is more a walking than a skiing jacket, but the extra length and peaked
hood are all plus points for a reliable outer layer to wear over a
fleece in serious Scottish weather. Its American-Irish parentage is
quite undetectable in the colour range: harebell among the heather.
Couloir Evolution one-piece suit (#339).
Test by Marj King, instructor. 5ft 1in. Usually wears That
instructor's suit or Henri Duvillard two-piece.
BEING small, I've always had difficulty in finding skiwear to fit.
However, this Couloir suit has converted me to the warmth and comfort of
a one-piece.
Unlike others that I have tried, this pale yellow suit was
comfortable, giving me plenty of room for movement without drowning me
and, although it was a little long in the leg, the arm length was about
right. It felt very light to wear while keeping me warm throughout a
chilly day's teaching and breathed well with no build-up of moisture
inside, something which I have found with other skiwear.
Unfortunately, I did not manage to try it in the rain but Couloir has
a good reputation for being waterproof, even in Cairngorm weather. I
thought it lent itself to teaching as the shape enabled me to show body
movement to my class and the style allowed me to bend and stretch
without being baggy or bulky.
Teaching mainly on the windy slopes of Cairngorm I like a big collar
to cover my face and this one fitted the bill with the added advantage
of a warm, soft lining to stop the zip from sticking to my chin. I would
have preferred an outside pocket at about waist height for headband,
suncream, etc. However, this is a minor point as I usually carry a hat
and other bits and pieces down the front of my jacket and there was
plenty of room for that.
It is very easy to get on and off, which comes in handy when you have
to change in the car-park. Although narrow in the hips it opened wide
enough to allow the top half to slip on smoothly. A good buy and well
worth the money.
North Face EG Tech jacket (#300) and EG Tech salopettes (#210).
Tested by James Freeman, journalist. 6ft. Usually wears original Killy
jacket and Moniteur racing pants.
NORTH Face ski kit is not cheap. Every feature of the design exudes
class. The experienced skier immediately detects a climbing pedigree and
he would be right. North Face are the Californian company who bought the
assets of Black's of Greenock. The top-of-the-range EG Tech jacket and
salopettes which we tested are clearly based on climbing designs and are
part of a layering system. Cut from Gore-tex to a Scottish design, the
idea is to keep out snow, wind, and rain. The boot cuffs are a good
example of thoughtful design; the inner cuff is elasticated with Velcro
and studs over the boot-top while the outer, also with a Velcro vent,
double studs to make a perfect seal. The problem of stubborn zips, a
feature of most racing pants, is eliminated.
The seal was effective in the seriously wet snow of last weekend and,
no doubt, would be so in deep powder. Similarly the sleeves are cut wide
for ease of access but also Velcro tight to exclude powder or rain. The
hood is voluminous, showing the climbing influence.
The suits are tested by Gore to a very high standard, particularly for
waterproof qualities, before the design is approved. The entire cut is
generous to allow layers, including thermals, shirt, jersey, and fleece,
underneath. North Face's EG Tech ski range will be on sale in Scottish
outlets from September 1 this year, priced and aimed at the top end of
the outdoor market -- a direct response to climbers and hillwalkers who
found their earlier ranges perfect for skiing.

The wedge-shaped chunk of America that is Maryland tapers to a mere
two-and-a-half miles in the west of the state. But before that there are
plenty of wide-open spaces to explore on horseback and, as Angela
Humphery discovers, plenty of scope to hammer on about your favourite
seafood.
THE noise was deafening as I walked into Woody's Crab House at North
East -- a town whose name means more than just a direction. It stands at
the mouth of the North East River on Chesapeake Bay in Cecil County,
Maryland, 45 miles north of Baltimore.
I'd heard that Woody's had opened a year ago but thought it to be
still under construction, so loud was the sound of hammering. However,
this was a perfectly normal lunchtime with diners wielding little wooden
mallets rather than knives and forks. The two couples at the next table
had come all the way from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, just to lunch
here on steamed crabs and crab cakes, shrimp and scallops.
Maryland is a wedge-shaped slice of America, roughly halfway down the
Atlantic coast -- hence its temperate climate. At Hancock, in the west
of the state, it's a mere two-and-a-half-miles wide, and should you take
a wrong turn, as we did, in no time at all you're in Pennsylvania or
West Virginia.
Cecil County, named after the second Lord Baltimore, is a rural oasis
(one-fifth of the US population live within 300 miles of this county)
tucked up in the north-east corner along the famed Mason Dixon Line.
Five rivers feed from it into the top of Chesapeake Bay (the
Susquehanna, the North East, the Elk, the Bohemia, and Sassafras) so it
isn't too surprising that with 200 miles of waterfront, seafood features
prominently on every menu, and with 45 marinas and 4000 boat-slips
watersports and fishing are popular pastimes.
There's lots for landlubbers too. History galore from Indian lore to
the War of Independence and the Civil War with battlefields, war
re-enactments, and military museums, all serving as reminders of this
tiny state's contribution to the annals of history. In North East at the
Upper Bay Museum, located in an 1880 fish-house, you can see the
waterman's way of life as you'll never see it again. In historic
Charlestown there was a ''Tea Party'' before the one in Boston. while in
Earleville gracious living can still be seen at Mt Harmon, a restored
eighteenth-century tobacco plantation on the banks of the Sassafras
River.
Although squeezed into the right-hand corner of the state, Cecil
County is the centre of equestrian activity in Maryland, with 5600-acre
Fair Hill being home to two national equestrian organisations and
hosting numerous equestrian events. The highlights are Fair Hill Races
in spring and autumn and the annual October Fair Hill International
Three-Day Event, a world class competition.
With around 10,000 acres of horse country, Cecil County has the
largest thoroughbred horse production this side of Kentucky, and such
famous racehorses as Northern Dancer and Kelso hailed from here. Riders
and non-riders alike can take a Chesapeake Horse Country Tour with Hill
Holidays who have exclusive access to private spreads that are home to
equine legends. Kelso was born and is buried on Mrs Richard C du Pont's
Woodstock Farm. Unprecedented five times Horse of the Year, he has his
headstone inscribed: WHERE HE GALLOPS, THE EARTH SINGS.
However, the county isn't all crab houses, history, and horses. For
those who like to shop till they drop, help is at hand. Antiques,
auctions, boutiques, collectables (how I love that word), craft shows,
flea markets, and designer outlets are spread all around. The downtown
areas of of Chesapeake City, North East, and Elkton offer hours of
browsing while, driving along the back roads, you can pick up a bargain
at a roadside stall.
If names such as Nike and Claiborne ring a bell, then don't miss the
Perryville Outlet Center where 40 brand-name shops sell at
factory-outlet prices. Having splurged #25 at the duty-free at Gatwick
on a pair of Liz Claiborne sunglasses, I found an identical pair at
Perryville for a fiver.
Undoubtedly, the jewel in the county's crown is Chesapeake City. Not a
throbbing metropolis as its name suggests but a picture-postcard
nineteenth-century village -- a national historic district of tree-lined
streets bordered by lollipop-coloured clapboard houses. Originally
called Bohemia Village, Chesapeake City straddles the Chesapeake and
Delaware Canal, a 12-mile-long strip of water connecting the Delaware
River with Chesapeake Bay, thus saving shipping a 300-mile journey.
Born out of a dream of Augustine Herman (a native of Prague, Bohemia)
in 1764 a canal route was marked off but it wasn't until 1804 that
shovels, oak buckets, and mules started moving dirt. Chesapeake City
became the hub of the construction project, completed in 1829, and the
tiny town boomed for the next century.
However, some 25 years ago it went downhill and became a hang-out for
bikers and druggies with the houses and shops being boarded up and
falling into disrepair. About a decade ago Mrs du Pont, the racehorse
breeder and owner of the late Kelso, came to the rescue. She bought up
some of the houses, plus the Bayard House Restaurant (now painted in her
racing colours of yellow and grey), selling them to her friends and
staff for $1 apiece on condition that they renovated them. The town has
been given a new lease of life, bringing back traders, tourists, and
guests for the B &amp; Bs.
Talking of B &amp; Bs, I'd vote the Blue Max Inn on Bohemia Street, a
Georgian federal-style home built in 1854, as best B &amp; B ever. Pale blue
and white outside and Laura Ashley inside, it was once owned by author
Jack Hunter, who wrote the book (later filmed) after which the inn was
named. Today Maria Lure and Philip Braeunig Junior will welcome you.
Cecil County is certainly Maryland's best-kept secret and Chesapeake
City the county's best-kept secret. Here, in this step-back-in-time, you
can escape the Dunkin' Donut by simply pulling up the patchwork quilt
and pretending you're in a bygone era.

THIS afternoon, Dave Barrett, the West of Scotland stand off, will
make the trip to Malleny Park to watch his team-mates fight for a place
in next year's first division as they take on already relegated Currie.
Not bad for one who broke an ankle a week ago playing for West in a
friendly against Preston Lodge under lights.
On Saturday morning, in London, Barrett's leg break was the talk of
the Scottish Golden Oldies team as they took on their English
counterparts at London Scottish. News travelled fast that his injury had
caused his match to be abandoned.
''I'd like to go and see the boys play against Currie, even though it
is a 200 yard walk to the pitch,' said Barrett. ''After all, I haven't
been put off rugby totally. I came out of the anaesthetic at one o'clock
last Saturday afternoon, and still managed to watch the international at
2.30. I got my ankle caught in the ground and turned the wrong way,
which, I'm told, is the normal way to break it.
''I've never had a serious injury before, the odd broken finger and my
nose, but I knew this one was bad because of the noise the bone made as
it broke, and because everyone jumped out of the way. There were 10
minutes to go, they got a stretcher on to the pitch, and I think
everyone had had enough anyway so the game was stopped.''
Barrett, who has played 44 games for Glasgow and three times for
Scotland B, is a PE teacher at Glasgow High, and has already popped his
face back in the door at the school, on Wednesday, but there isn't much
a teacher can do with one leg in a plaster.
''I'll take a good break from it all, as I do every summer, and come
back to some kind of physical activity in the autumn,'' he said.
''No-one has said how long it will be, so I'll just have to wait, but I
have never had any pressure put on me by my employers, or my family, to
give it all up. We'll just have to wait and see.''
Barrett has always been one of the most gifted rugby players in
Scotland. He has a swerve that would break your heart, an ability to
step on the gas to back it all up, a look of confounding vulnerability,
and a kick that can be as clean as the morning dew.
His trouble is that he can be erratic. Laid back at times, and
mercurial. As in helping his side's win over Watsonians this season with
a last-gasp drop goal from the half-way line, which merely gave us the
quote that: ''It was about time I had done something useful because I
had been having a shocker.''
Now that West cannot rely on some Barrett magic to pull them through
-- the game is vital for the Burnbrae side -- does he think that they
can give themselves a lifeline by beating Currie? ''I'd like to think
that we can go there with some confidence and self belief about getting
the win, even though we haven't had very good away form this season,''
he said. ''Dave McKee is away skiing -- to be fair to him this is
another re-arranged game -- so the side is doubly weakened, but we must
go there with the right attitude.
Even if we do win, then it's not a case of definitely staying up, we
still have to look out for the results of the other sides in the same
area as us.''
Win lose or draw, and Barrett is not convinced that his side can avoid
the drop to the restructured second division in the new Premier League
set up, he sees a bright future for West of Scotland.
''I think that we are getting a good squad of young players together
now, a team that could challenge seriously in the future,'' he said.
''Even if we do go down, given the players that we have we could fight
to get back up next season. All the young guys are enjoying it, we enjoy
being involved with them, and we are now attracting the right kind of
player to the club.''
Getting and experienced grafter like Dave McVey has been a real boost,
and Dave has been doing the kind of on-field work that Gordon McPherson
did before he took up the coaching duties.''
Later today he will have to stand and watch as his team fights against
the drop. And that, always, is a lonely task. Everyone in Scottish rugby
will be hoping that the likeable Barrett will be able to bring some more
joie de vivre to the club scene before hanging up his boots, whenever
that may be.

As the clouds of terror clear over Northern Ireland, Jack McLean
returns to find the enthusiasm of its tourist bosses is not at all
misplaced . . . and, after many lean years, deserves to be amply
rewarded.
GIVE the Northern Irish Tourist Board a big hand, do. They have tried
so hard over the years. While Scotland's tourist people have oft rested
on the simple fact that they find it easy to attract visitors (if hard
to get anybody returning), Ireland, North and South, has found it very
difficult indeed since the beginning of the Troubles in the North.
Horribly unfair to the South, where the Republic is. Horribly unfair
to the North where the actual conflict has been for a quarter and more
of a century. But any journalist will tell you about what the Southern
Irish were wont to call ''the Black North'': we have been bombarded for
years with exhortations about why we should all visit Northern Ireland.
For those who thought you would be bombed out of your hotel and
Balaclava terrorists met you for cocktails, and British Army squaddies
poked automatic rifles into your ribs when you shopped in Woolworths,
for those who thought that, it was ever a revelation that, in fact,
Northern Ireland was generally a remarkably crime-free zone.
You will not get muggings in the streets as one would in Miami, or
Cardiff, or Pamplona, or any Italian resort you care to name. What you
did get at one time was an undeniable anxiety about certain areas of
Northern Irish cities and towns. What you missed was the sheer beauty of
the northern part of Ireland and the astounding hospitality of the
natives.
The Northern Irish Tourist people know how big a task it is to explain
about the province. Years ago I remember going to Bangor, a sea harbour
of astounding loveliness with a population which was not only
marvellously civilised but richer than any community I had ever seen
outside of Zurich.
Explain that, as a tourist lot, when the news programmes have nothing
but bombings in Newry or Crossmaglen. Explain that the people in the
North have a higher level of education than anywhere in Europe, second
only to, oddly, the Republic of Ireland.
Well, I found myself in the company of the redoubtable Joris Minnh, of
the NITB, and having a wee libation in The Herald's own Press Bar.
That's why I found myself two days later flying across to Belfast for a
trip across to Ulster.
I do not enjoy flying: indeed it takes the courage of a Spartacus for
me to commit it . . . well anyway, a good few Bushmills the night before
in Glasgow. I found myself on the plane across to Belfast. I hadn't been
there in six years. I went across with the head of the NITB, Lord
Strathcavan. The hostesses were awffy good to my me and Lord Strathcavan
and I could not understand why: I am not that handsome really. Turns out
it was Lord Strathcavan. I didn't know he was a lord and always thought
of him as Hugh O'Neil, who we in Scotland have known for years by that
moniker. Didn't know his daddy was a lord at all. There you are.
There we were, after a wee briefing with Joris and lots of lovely
girls with tourist clip-boards, in a pub with yet another Northern Irish
aristo. The pub was the Crown, a magnificent Edwardian pub. There can be
few tourist authorities who take you off to a pub first thing: most
pretend that pubs and bars don't exist and drag you off to the most
bourgeois of hotels, but Ireland is Ireland, North and South.
The Crown is actually the first port of call for visitors to Belfast
for it is not only virtually unspoiled (the lighting is still by
gaslight), it is the only public house in the UK which is owned and
operated by the National Trust. The noble who sat beside Lord
Strathcavan was another Northern Irish fellow, Randall McDonnell, the
grandson of the Earl of Antrim. Both had been brought together in this
marvellous hostelry for a feature piece for a French magazine, intrigued
to find two Irish noblemen from the two communities. Hugh is Prod and
Randall is Papist. The both speak in accents of the English public
schools, just like Scots toffs: it'd make you sick. Mind, they both
bought a drink. And in a pub at that. Scottish earls would rather close
down a pub than drink in one.
The Crown was splendid and a fine example of the Edwardiana of
Belfast. So were many other spots in Belfast. Disabuse yourself of the
notion that Belfast is the Falls Road and the Shankhill and nothing
else. It has ever been a prosperous city. I went there shortly after the
peace process and saw the change. You can walk into the pubs and
restaurants with impunity: you will even hear what should have been
heard these past 25 years: debates. Even sectarian ones, with the spice
of humour which has perhaps been lacking in this city for far too long.
Later, we found ourselves in the Golden Mile, where all the smart
restaurants (I much commend the Restaurant 44, in which I feasted on
both food and conversation) and pubs are, and very smart they are too.
Belfast has some of the best eating houses you can imagine in the
British islands. It is just that you don't expect that.
But the tourist board laid on more than that. They are dreadful, in
Ireland, for trying to cram too much in (awful keen on showing off
because not only do the Irish love a visitor, and are curious about
anybody from elsewhere, dammit, they need the money from tourism
itself), and they crammed in a visit for myself to Navan Fort in Armagh.
Armagh is bandit country, by tradition, but it is very beautiful, a
bit like the loveliest parts of Ayrshire indeed, rolling dales and
spruce hedgerows, and Armagh City could be Kilmarnock before the
supermarket chains turned up. It is a city simply because it has a
cathedral and very quiet the little place is. But Navan Fort is
something else. It is a big, round hill. It is also nearly #4m worth of
tourist development. And something for our Scottish tourist people to
see and learn from.
Indeed, as Navan Fort boss Paul Mullen, a one-time PR supremo whom I
remember myself years back, and him very high-powered, said to me: ''We
met some of your people from Glencoe, looking at what we had done
here.'' Indeed, I told him that for God's sake don't give them ideas,
for there is enough damage being done to Glencoe and Skye, and the West
Highland Way and Loch Lomond or whatever. Paul, a history graduate with
an enormous interest in his country's archaeology, and that particularly
of his own native Armagh, understood that when I explained the problems.
''But here,'' he said, ''we need people to come, not just tourists, but
our own people. We do a wonderful trip around for our children who
hardly know of the old legends of Ulster.''
And indeed they do. And splendid for those of other lands. The Navan
Fort stretches back into antiquity and is Northern Ireland's most
important prehistoric monument, the political and spiritual capital of
the ancient kings of Ulster. (They are horribly keen on kings in
Ireland; there seem to be loads of them.) But the centre itself which
cost nearly #4 m, saw over 50,000 visitors in its first year and you can
see why. It is gorgeously designed with a film and displays of a level
of hi-tech which would take your breath away. Considering that this
archaelogical find of world importance was only discovered in 1963, it
astounds one to confront this amazing relic. But even more astounding to
see what they have done with this centre.
It was a lot of money spent. It was, argues the Northern Irish Tourist
people, well spent. In the wake of the peace it seems to me it was. The
Guinness in the Crown in Belfast was nice too. Peaceful as well in the
dark of the bar, and the light of the day.

By ROBINSON HOLLOWAY in Florida
NICK Faldo, claiming no diminution of the game that has given him a
win, a second, and a fifth place finish in the last three weeks, missed
the cut at the Players' Championship by four strokes yesterday.
''I hit only two shots off line in 36 holes,'' said Faldo. Since his
ball striking was not at fault, Faldo looked to other explanations of
his 80-73 scoring -- the windy weather and equipment failure.
On Thursday, two minutes before he teed off, Faldo's caddie, Fanny
Sunesson, pulled out a sleeve of balata balls, 50 compression. Faldo
plays 40 compression, and sent someone scurrying back to the locker room
to get the right balls, but 50s were the only ones in his locker.
Yesterday. Faldo played the second round with a combination of old
balls and new, saying afterwards that the change in compression may have
cost him six or seven strokes.
The best score yesterday morning belonged to Davis Love III, who shot
a 67 to move to four under par, two behind overnight leader Corey Pavin.
Germany's Bernhard Langer also finished the second round at four under
par, shooting a 71.
Langer at one point on the back nine had it to seven under to take the
lead alone, but had a bogey and a double-bogey in his last five holes.
The last time he played this well at Sawgrass was 1993, when he finished
second to Nick Price and won the US Masters two weeks later.
Of the nine Europeans, six made the cut at five over par. Langer was
best placed with Ian Woosnam and Seve Ballesteros both under par for the
tournament at 143.
Jesper Parnevik easily made it, despite two mediocre scores of 74,
along with Jose Maria Olazabal. Colin Montgomerie had a 70 to make the
cut on the line at five over. Faldo, Sandy Lyle, and David Feherty all
missed. Leading scores (Americans unless stated):
139 -- C Pavin 66, 73; G Sauers 67, 72.
140 -- B Langer (Germany) 69, 71; D Love III 73, 67; S Stricker 69,
71.
141 -- H Irwin 73, 68; D Weibring 71, 70.
142 -- L Clements 71, 71; P Stewart 69, 73.
143 -- I Woosnam (Wales) 74, 69; S Ballesteros (Spain) 75, 68; R Gamez
74, 69; B Bryant 72, 71; T Lehman 71, 72; L Janzen 69, 74; B Andrade 74,
69; P Jacobsen 74, 69; Jeff Maggert 71, 72; T Watson 72, 71.
144 -- E Els (S Africa) 72, 72; M Ozaki (Japan) 72, 72; N Ozaki
(Japan) 74, 70; C Byrum 73, 71; B Claar 74, 70; P Mickelson 78, 66; G
Norman (Australia) 70, 74; N Price (Zimbabwe) 73, 71; J Cook 71, 73.
Other scores included: 148 -- J Parnevik (Sweden) 74, 74; J M Olazabal
(Spain) 78, 70. 149 -- C Montgomerie (Scotland) 79, 70. 153 -- N Faldo
(England) 80, 73. 155 -- S Lyle (Scotland) 79, 76; D Feherty (N Ireland)
73, 82.

THOUGH many greenhouses lie idle from November to March, they are
still very valuable and much sought-after items, writes IAN WALLS.
Here are key points to look for:
* Glazing systems. The sealed system is best. Glass is held in by bar
caps, but you will pay more.
* Ventilation. Make sure you have plenty. In my 6X8 Robinson
greenhouse I have a large automatic roof ventilator and a louvre vent in
the gable end. If I were getting another I would have two ventilators in
the roof. Plus two more on the side.
* Stability. This is important. Don't be frightened to push the side
of a showhouse. See if it moves in any way. If it is flimsy, vibration
will be bad in windy weather.
* Erection. Check on how easy it is to put up. Are there good
instructions? Are there base blocks or cleats? Firm anchorage is vital.
* Services. You need a good water and electricity supply. I supply
services via the house, with a fused plug at both ends to keep things
safe. Be careful with wiring. Unless you are fully competent, get in a
professional. A metal greenhouse can go live if you get things wrong.

THE conservatory can change your lifestyle in a climate not always
amenable to outdoor pursuits, writes EILEEN CRONE. It can be a restful
sun lounge, a second living room or den for teenagers, somewhere to grow
a grapevine and more tender plants, a dining room, kitchen, or spare
bedroom. More offbeat uses include observatory, games room, or artist's
studio.
In Victorian times the wood-built conservatory was used as a garden
room in which to enjoy year-round sunshine. It was popular in colonial
India, and a Paisley company exported many models to Pakistan and the
Far East.
The conservatory is classified as a structure having walls at least
50% of glass, and a roof at least 75% translucent, using glass or modern
polycarbonates. It can provide extra room when the family grows -- and,
not surprisingly, it has become more popular with the recession
inhibiting people's ability to move house.
If single-glazed, its use is more limited as it overheats like a
greenhouse in warm weather and there can be condensation problems. But
the more elaborate types are weather-proof, designed to be used all
year.
A conservatory can add value to your house, but this will seldom
exceed half of what it cost. But it may make the difference in achieving
a sale.
Costs vary from DIY kits at around #3500-#4000 (B &amp; Q offers a
Victorian design at #2000) to a bespoke design of up to #20,000 at the
top end of the market. An average mid-range model, 10ft by 12ft, costs
between #6000 and #9000. There has been a move away from the lean-to
style, though this is the most practical and least expensive.
You also need to think about heating and ventilation, perhaps with a
fan heater or gas appliance. A decorative Victorian-style ceiling fan
(up to 50in across) can help regulate temperature, and heat-retaining
blinds are useful in winter.
Most people light their conservatory with table or standard lamps, and
two or more power points will be needed. There is no British Standard
for a conservatory, though parts such as glass, sealed units, and locks
are covered.
The structure must be built properly to ensure good seals and a strong
frame. If you attempt to build your own, there are a number of skills
you need -- bricklaying, drainage, joinery, and electrics. Assembling
the kit can be complicated. It is not really a single-handed job, and
preparation of a concrete base for the average conservatory costs around
#1000.
A conservatory does not always require building warrants, provided it
uses an existing door from the house. The structure must be at least one
metre from boundaries with neighbouring land (otherwise a fire-resistant
wall is required), and it must be attached to a house, not a flat.
Generally, a building warrant is not required provided the floor area is
not more than 320sqft, and it does not contain a heater burning solid,
gas, or liquid fuel.
Costs and procedures for building warrant applications are the same
across Scotland, eg a #9000 conservatory has a fee of #148 and a #6000
conservatory has a fee of #100. The time it takes to process the
application varies from authority to authority.
You may need planning permission if a listed building or conservation
area is involved, or if the conservatory will be visible from the main
road.
As a preliminary it is best to check with your local planning
department and building control/property services. Putting your idea in
writing, with a small sketch, could save a great deal of time and
trouble. You don't want to find that you have floored over drains or
that the style of conservatory is not in keeping with the conservation
area that you may be part of.

A whole host of renovations and innovations are helping to put
Brighton firmly back on the tourist map, finds Kirsty Scott.
BRIGHTON is splashing out on its famous seafront, landscaping the
lower promenade and restoring the beautiful Victorian arches. The result
is that new clubs, pubs, restaurants, cafes, and other attractions are
moving into the lively Sussex resort.
There is also a burgeoning arts and crafts area as even the tiniest
arches are transformed into workshops, and two new ''living history''
museums are taking shape in the largest arches.
The Brighton Fishing Museum has just opened. It is at the centre of
the fishing quarter where the local fishermen still mend their nets and
sell their fish and it houses a full-size traditional Sussex fishing
boat -- a clinker-built punt.
Work is well-advanced to convert three arches into the Living
Postcards museum, due to open on the lower prom this summer. It will
trace the history of the seaside postcard, with a healthy dollop of
sauce and plenty of family fun.
Neighbouring Hove's fascinating Foredown Tower has new interactive
touch-screen computers with information and games about the environment.
The hilltop tower on the South Downs was built in 1909 and is now a
countryside pursuits centre. Its popular Camera Obscura gives visitors a
great view of the surrounding countryside.
On a watery theme, an Edwardian loo called The Falls is among the
treasures revealed in three attic rooms just opened to the public in
Brighton's Edwardian Preston Manor.
* A STUDY by tourism officials in Kent has uncovered a growing market
of holidaymakers with a strong interest in exploring landscape and
wildlife on foot as opposed to travelling by car or taking a
resort-based holiday.
Now, the firm EasyBreaks and Kent Tourism have launched a programme of
walking holidays taking in the county's picturesque rural scenery and
its dramatic coastline. Oast to Coast Trailways will offer holidaymakers
the opportunity to tailor-make their own itinerary or choose a complete
walk from a range of seven circular and four linear routes. Overnight
accommodation and a luggage-forwarding service where necessary are built
in.
Kent Tourism's David Hughes, said: ''There is a demand for holidays
which are in harmony with the environment. By packaging walks with
accommodation and without luggage we believe these holidays will appeal
to both the committed walkers and people just wanting to do away with
planning and any arduous back-packing.''
The routes use well-planned and signposted existing walks including
the Stour Valley walk, the Kentish part of the Greensand Way, the North
Downs Way, and a series of coastal walks. The price is based just on
accommodation and luggage-forwarding. Lowest cost is #28. A brochure is
available from Christine Holmes on 0892 511808 or Karen McKenzie at Kent
Tourism on 0622 696047.
* THE North Pennines, which markets itself as England's last
wilderness, is celebrating the Year of Arts and Culture by holding a
spring festival from April 22 to May 8.
Alston Market Cross will be the location for the first recital of the
Festival Fanfare, specially composed for 1995, on April 24.
The landscape of the North Pennines Area of Outstanding National
Beauty gives the Festival a wholly English backdrop. The local towns of
Alston, Allendale, and Stanhope are among the places hosting music,
walks, readings, and arts and craft events. Details: 0434 382069.
* THE English Riviera resorts of Torquay, Paignton, and Brixham have
launched a series of events for the summer season. The area's own
festival month is May, when Paignton celebrates its 700th birthday. The
town will hold a Mystery on the English Riviera event to celebrate the
region's connections with crime writers, notably Agatha Christie, and
there will be murder evenings, life-size Cluedo, journeys by steam
train, and a mystery trail. The month ends with the Brixham Heritage
Festival and the English Riviera dance festival. Further details: 0803
296296.
* MODEL train enthusiasts can fire their passion at a model railway
exhibition at the Historic Dockyard in Chatham, Kent, on June 10-11.
Featuring dozens of layouts and demonstrations, the event will fit in
well with the dockyard's normal seafaring transport exhibits.
A special River Day on the Medway on July 9 will feature free trips on
the paddle steamer Kingswear Castle, a sail-past, raft race, street
entertainers, a giant Rupert Bear balloon, and an air display over the
dockyard. The European Petanque Championship will also take place on
that day.
Details: 0634 812551.
* ENGINEERS began work recently on an underground cable network
designed to pull the leaning Tower of Pisa back from the brink of
collapse.
The system could replace the 600-ton lead ingots hurriedly put in
place to serve as counterweights on the 180-foot tower.
The new project involves connecting the tower to an underground
platform with 50 steel cables, each with varying degrees of tension
intended to stop the tilt and pull it slightly more upright. The system
is expected to be completed late this year.
The goal is to straighten the twelfth-century tower just 1.6 inches.
So far it has been straightened by half that amount by the
counterweights installed in July 1993.
The head of the international team installing the cables, Michele
Jiamiolkowski, said they could remain in place for 80 years, but he
still called it ''a non-permanent solution''.
''Hopefully other ideas and other technologies will arrive that will
definitively solve the problems of the monument,'' he said.
* MAGICIAN David Copperfield is planning to stage a show in communist
North Korea in July on the first anniversary of the death of ''Great
Leader'' Kim Il-sung.
The South Korean daily Chosun Ilbo said the North was negotiating with
an unnamed US sponsor on ways to transport about 60 tonnes of equipment
to the show in Pyongyang. The show is expected to be held on July 8 or
9.

WORLD champion Stephen Hendry required a fluke and then a deciding
frame to reach the semi-finals of the Benson and Hedges Masters at
Goffs, County Kildare.
Hendry defeated Irishman Ken Doherty 5-4, with the fireworks in the
eighth frame as Doherty led 4-3 and 58-50 after having been 3-1 down.
The Scot, twice attempting to play safe, failed to guide the cue ball
far enough to hit one of the last two reds. If he had missed a third
time he would have forfeited the frame and match, so he took a wild
swipe at the red nearest to him.
Fortune smiled on the Scot as the other red dropped into the bottom
pocket. ''It was a monster fluke, one bit of good fortune like that can
make all the difference,'' said Hendry.
In the decider, he missed the black after potting the final red, and a
colours clearance would have been enough to take Doherty through, but he
missed the brown.
Hendry next meets Ulsterman Joe Swail, who reeled off four frames in a
row to beat world No.3 James Wattana 5-3.

CLARKE, Nickolls &amp; Coombs shares jumped 46% -- from 5.5p to 7.5p -- as
the resurrected property company gave a foretaste of what is likely to
come in the years ahead.
Rental income is running at more than #6m a year compared with just
#2m in 1993 -- that includes some low-yielding property such as Fort
Matilda in Gourock, a former torpedo factory on a six-acre site, but
also a clutch of rather more profitable shopping centres and industrial
assets.
Pre-tax profits rose from #99,000 to #1.2m and analysts believe they
could further increase to about #1.5m in 1995.
CNC was rescued by Channel Hotels and Properties in 1993 and that
company is required to reduce its existing 47% stake to 29.9% by the
year-end. It is likely that that will be achieved through CNC buying
more property for shares, ideally a small company standing at a discount
to net asset value. Its own shares are at a 20% discount to net assets
of 9.38p and there are also #20m of tax losses available. This means it
will not be paying corporation tax for some time.
There is a final dividend of 0.1p, a total of 0.2p (nil) and a 3.3%
yield.

HAMLEYS, the toyshop group, rang up record profits last year of #5.6m
before tax, ahead of City expectations. That compares with taxable
profits of #2.7m in 1993, and was achieved on 25% higher sales of
#26.2m.
In its first full year as a public company, cash generation was strong
and the group ended the year free of debt and with a positive cash
balance of #3.7m.
Shareholders are to receive a final dividend of 5p, making a total
dividend for the year of 7p. This represents an increase of 49% over the
4.7p that would have been paid had the company been publicly quoted last
year.
The strong results buoyed Hamleys shares 10p higher to 192p where they
yield 4.6%.

Wendy Jack discovers that people who live in glass rooms often throw
parties
SILVER dawns, vermilion sunsets, a perpetual garden . . . people who
have invested in glass rooms have captured that seductive
other-worldiness that the nicest conservatories bring. A feeling of
stepping off the whirlwind of life for a bit, and sinking into the bliss
of true relaxation.
Is it the garden setting that does it? Or the light? Whatever, better
not to risk breaking the spell with too much analysis. Instead, sit back
and revel in it.
A couple of years after substantially extending their lovely
cottage-style home at Strathblane, John and Kirsty Watson decided they'd
like to add an extra room. ''We weren't particularly thinking of
conservatories as such,'' explains Kirsty. ''Just a nice, sunny room off
the kitchen where we and the three boys could get in and out of the
garden easily. It was also going to be somewhere for me to paint . . .''
Kirsty decorates everything from buckets to toy boxes and furniture to
great effect. ''We liked the idea, too, of a place for us to sit on
summer evenings instead of using our big main lounge,'' she adds.
What the Watsons eventually got was a brilliant room: a conservatory
in all but its slated roof. It has windows fully curtained in a warm,
floral fabric dancing with poppies and other flowers in rusts, golds,
creams, and ochres. The same fabric has been used on the cushions of the
canework suite. Full central heating allows the room to be used year
round, keeping it beautifully snug in spite of the terracotta floor,
''It's so comfortable and cosy,'' says Kirsty. ''On a summer evening
we love using it for drinks if I'm having a supper party in the
kitchen.''
A lovely focal point is an old wheelbarrow filled with rhododendrons
that the Watsons bought in an antique shop. ''It was covered in green
paint but I said to John, 'We've got to have this','' laughs Kirsty.
''He just looked at me and said, 'Oh God . . .' I explained I wanted to
strip it down and put plants in it. We spent hours working on it in the
garage, it was great fun and it's turned out to be absolutely
stunning.''
The slated roof on the Watsons' conservatory has increased the warmth
of the room in winter, keeps it from overheating in summer, and cuts
down on noise and dirt, they believe. All in all it's been a resounding
success.
But an extra room of glass can fulfil a working role as well as being
a place of leisure. Anne Mackintosh has a well-established reputation as
one of Scotland's leading portrait painters. Margaret Thatcher, John
Major, Ian Lang, Malcolm Rifkind, Lord Hanson, and more recently the
Duchess of York and General Patrick Cordingley, of Gulf war fame, are
among those who have sat for her.
A few years ago she added to her Stirlingshire home a studio and
conservatory for her work. The latter, she felt, ''would be a nice place
for my sitters to go when they needed a break and change of scene. It's
always light there, whatever the weather.''
When she got the conservatory at first, she explains, ''I had great
ideas about plants I'd put in it. Now, because I'm so busy, it has to be
things that thrive on neglect; I've made it a conservatory that's as
easy to run as possible.''
Inspiration must surely be drawn from the huge azalea, which has
delighted everyone since before Christmas with its profusion of large
pink blooms. Another, in pale pink, measuring several feet across, is
about to burst forth. Anne points to the jasmine in full flower,
explaining, ''Doesn't it smell gorgeous? And these primulas also have a
wonderful scent.''
Not only sitters appreciate this restful, pretty room -- Gorgeous
George, Anne's Burman cat, adores it. If he finds its door closed he
miaows appealingly to be let in before heading to a chair where he curls
up and snoozes happily. ''I think he was someone who had his portrait
painted a lot in another life,'' smiles Anne. ''I've painted him a few
times. He really is an excellent subject.''
Currently Anne is working on a portrait of the late John Smith as a
gift to his widow, Elizabeth. The couple attended Glasgow University for
part of the time that Anne Mackintosh and her doctor husband were
students there and the four subsequently met on a number of occasions
through mutual friends.
''There's nothing you can do to give comfort at these times,'' says
Anne wistfully. ''I'm working on the portrait from videos of John Smith,
which is much better than using a photograph because the essence of the
person shines through.''
In Edinburgh, Morag and David Carson have been enjoying the pretty,
Victorian-style conservatory, custom-built to complement their house of
that period, for nine years. With its faithfully reproduced finials
along the roof line and Gothic insets at the windows neighbours have
commented that ''it looks as if it belongs to the house'', says David
Carson, who heads his own media representation company in the city.
The couple own part of the fine old house, which was originally built
for the Melrose tea family. ''We wanted a room to relax in and enjoy the
sun,'' continues David Carson. ''Morag and I dine in it when it's nice
in summer, and it's a good room when we're entertaining. We have drinks
there before going to the dining room.''
With its fine sturdy double doors to the garden, and similar
astragalled doors leading into a reception room, the Carsons'
conservatory with its plants, candles, tiled floor with a Roman effect
mosaic detail, canework chairs, and terracotta-tiled table is a real
link between house and garden. ''In summer it's wonderful for
barbecues,'' says Morag. ''The only thing we didn't anticipate was the
noise when it rains really heavily.''
Just talking conservatories . . . doesn't it make you long for those
lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer again?

''THERE'S nothing like early retirement to keep you busy,'' says
Douglas Carlisle. And for him that means a spot of gardening.
From a quarter-acre site that was ''completely uncultivated'' he has
created a scene of colour and beauty.
''I suppose there must be 100 trees or shrubs and some other plants,''
he admits. ''There's the pond with frogs and newts and things like that.
I'm making another one for fish. Maybe add in a waterfall.
''It's great what you can do with a relatively small area. There's a
wee collection of trees, for example.''
That means: camellias, conifers, cordylines, Chinese and European fan
palms, eucalyptus, and pine trees. It includes the rare Mexican pine --
pinus Montezumae -- and pinus patula.
There are, he agrees, one or two rhododendrons. He likes them, and
they like local conditions. So he grows lots of them.
0 As a former quantity surveyor, Douglas Carlisle has put his skills
to good use designing and constructing his Helensburgh site. He keeps
cacti in his conservatory, and grows bedding seedlings in his
greenhouse.
And just to make sure he doesn't find time hanging on his hands, he's
now got a plot in the neighbourhood for vegetables and fruit.

THERE are few gardeners who haven't taken slips or cuttings from
parent plants, writes IAN WALLS. They produce roots and get great pride
in producing new plants.
Cuttings can be of various types and various sizes. With soft material
such as geraniums or chrysanthemums, cuttings are usually nodal -- cut
below a leaf joint or node and remove the lower leaves.
Insert the cuttings round the edge of a pot with some sandy compost.
Then put the pot into a large clear polythene bag. Seal it well and put
it on to a reasonably light window, but without direct sun.
Alternatively, with plants such as busy Lizzies, insert cuttings into
an inch or so of water. Use a jam jar. This way you can see the roots
forming.
Very soft cuttings can wilt for a few days. Don't worry too much. They
pick up again.
With cuttings from shrubs, it helps to take a heel. Remove the cutting
from the parent plant with a very sharp knife. Usually cuttings are 3in
to 4in long.
With border carnations you don't need to do any more than snap them
off. Whatever you do, remove all lower leaves and debris. Also ensure
that the rooting mixture is very free-draining.
Some gardeners swear by rooting hormone powder. Others swear at it.
You take your choice.

IT'S time to get on the gardening togs and go out into the garden,
writes IAN WALLS. If you don't know where to start, have a good look
around. That will give you inspiration enough.
With the blades set high on my cylinder mower I started by cutting the
lawn. If you wonder where all the humps and bumps come from it's because
the soil is never totally consistent. It can expand and contract due to
the effect of weather.
By the time you have finished mowing things should look a bit better.
If you are still concerned about the uneven state of the lawn it's time
to get a load of sand in.
Choose one of a gritty nature. It helps with the levels, and improves
surface drainage as well. Be wary that sand is pretty heavy and may do
the springs of your car no good.
It is better to have it delivered, to barrow it on to the lawn and
spread it evenly. Then you use the back of a big rake -- or a board with
handle attached -- to work the sand in.
The effect should be to fill up the low spots. You've seen
greenkeepers do this sort of thing. It's how they get a level surface.
Don't make the mistake of covering grass too deeply.
Brightening the garden should be a priority. There are lots of
attractive plants on sale, primroses in particular. There are plenty of
herbaceous plants and it is a good time to set them out.
Slugs will be waiting, of course. Be warned. A good tip is to surround
newly set-out plants with a circle of gritty sand. Better still, put
some ashes round. They help to deter slugs.
Don't be in a great hurry to do any serious digging. That does more
harm than good if the ground is still sticky. Certainly, don't think of
using a rotary cultivator until the ground is much drier. You can damage
the soil structure.
In greenhouses, and on window-sills, remember that the sun can be
surprisingly hot. It can be fatal to let young seedlings dry out. If you
are out all day, get some newspaper or tissue paper to cover vulnerable
young plants.
Plants in conservatories should be starting to brighten up. Don't
forget they may want extra feeding. Use Baby Bio or similar.
There is a lot of good liquid feed around. Some give a very rapid
boost to growth. Use the recommended dilution rates. Doubling up won't
improve the situation.
A job you may have to do is repair concrete paths or steps. If frost
has caused some disintegration, don't be in too much of a rush. Wait for
the frost to be past. That could be a few weeks yet.

SHOTTS-BASED Central Scotland Countryside Trust (CSCT) is possibly not
all that well known, but it keeps pretty busy all the same writes IAN
WALLS.
It began in 1985 as a small, low-profile, tree-planting charity. A few
years later it had increased its scope with the proposal for development
of the Central Scotland Forest.
Today it has turnover of more than #2.5m a year, employs 45 people,
and has planted something like seven million trees.
It works with the Scottish Office, seven district councils, three
regional councils, four local enterprise companies, Scottish Enterprise,
Scottish Natural Heritage, and the Forestry Commission, with various
other bodies and individuals contributing to the overall programme.
The Central Scotland Forest is being established in a 620 square mile
area, bounded roughly by Edinburgh in the east, Glasgow in the west,
Stirling in the north, and Lanark in the south.
The aim is to create a multi-purpose mosaic of farms, woodlands,
hedgerows, shelterbelts, towns, villages, and business sites in an area
with a history of mining and heavy engineering that has declined
significantly.
The project was undertaken for Strathkelvin District Council and
Dunbartonshire Enterprise under the CSCT's Brighter Business scheme.

THE intermittent cropping habits of apples in Scotland does much to
deter gardeners from growing them, writes IAN WALLS. The scourge of
apple canker and apple scab, the latter especially in wetter areas, is a
further deterrent.
Recent publicity afforded to Bramley seedling, however, reminds me
that this variety can do remarkably well here.
Research into the dreaded canker indicates that a lot of the infection
occurs at an early stage. You must be very selective where you buy.
Another problem is pollination. The Bramley needs a pollinator such as
Howgate Wonder to fruit well. Apple trees in a neighbour's garden may do
the trick, of course.
Finally, there is the quality of the fruit itself. No-one can deny
that this seedling is a superb variety. Before you dash out to buy,
however, remember that it is a vigorous variety. It needs room to give
of its best. Bramley seedlings come mainly as bushes, or half-standards.
Various root stocks control the rate at which they grow.
You want to avoid too dwarf a root stock. It may not be strong enough
to support branches once the bush gets established. Most bushes or trees
these days are available as container-grown stock. When planting, be
careful not to break up the root ball.
Don't just make a neat hole and pop the bush in. Dig out the ground
for some yards and put in organic matter. Ideally, the bush should be
staked using a patent tree tie, which avoids chafing but does not
restrict growth.
Bramley tends to fruit on long spurs. Pruning is more a question of
thinning out. Whether to prune a newly-planted bush is debatable. The
bush should not have any check if planted carefully. Leave pruning until
the autumn.
I found that new-season bushes have started coming into garden
centres. You will have to pay around #25. One snag is that the plant can
go on to a biennial pattern -- crop one year and miss the next. That is
why I advise no drastic pruning.

IT may seem odd, but those who know point out that too much rain does
your pond no good.
Excessive rainfall means fertilisers can be washed in, and that
results in unsightly growth of algae shortly after.
Right now some people may still have frozen edges to cope with. The
idea is to prevent icing with a floating heater, or a cover of bubble
wrap on a wooden frame.
Even putting in an old tennis ball can help to stop water freezing. In
any case don't smash up any ice that exists. It causes shock waves, and
that could kill any fish still in the pond.
Other points from experienced users: use a suitable water conditioner,
remove any excess soil that has gone into the pond, reduce acidity if
necessary.
If in doubt, ask those with experience. They're always willing to
help.

The Herald gardeners
answer your questions
Question: I am busy planning my vegetable garden and want to decide
whether it is worth growing main crop potatoes. The tubers get riddled
with small holes before they are all lifted. I am told this is caused by
eelworm. We like our potatoes, especially Golden Wonders. So is there
anything I can do?
Answer: It is a common misconception that eelworm causes small holes
like this. Potato cyst eelworm is a serious pest indeed and is rife in
many gardens. It can remain for many years.
The effect is to reduce overall crops, not to cause small holes. That
is definitely caused by slugs. They create uncountable damage up and
down the country.
A lot of research is going on. Apart from slug pellets there are
biological methods of control which are worth a try.
Many gardeners have become so fed up they grow only earlies. These are
usually out of the ground before the slugs make any real headway.
I am told on good authority that the barrel method of growing main
crop is a way of ensuring heavy crops free from slug damage. It is
easier to keep them at bay in a confined area. You grow potatoes in
barrels and constantly earth up. It is certainly worth a try. It will
not reduce the eelworm attack, however. Use fresh compost.
Q: I faithfully buy quality seed sowing compost. I use new seed and
provide ideal germinating conditions. And I still suffer from seedlings
keeling over and dying. This applies particularly to antirrhinum and
lobelia. What am I doing wrong?
A: You are suffering from damping off disease. It is caused by a
number of weak fungi floating around in the atmosphere. Commercial
growers have a range of preventive chemicals.
Amateurs have really only a limited range, of which old-fashioned
Cheshunt compound is probably the best. It should be watered on before
germination. Once the disease attacks, there's not a lot you can do
about it.
Trying to improve growing conditions with ventilation will help. It is
unfortunate that the practice of lining a greenhouse with bubble
polythene to conserve heat raises humidity considerably. That provides
ideal conditions for fungal development.
Damping off leads many gardeners to buy in seedlings or plantlets.

FOR the fifth successive year British alpine skiing's showcase racing
event, the British Land British National Ski Championships, will be
hosted by Tignes in France.
Tomorrow brings the first of two scheduled days of downhill training,
building up to Tuesday's championship downhill.
As an event sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS), it
has attracted a record entry for the organisers, the British Ski
Federation, with the entries coming from a dozen different nations
covering racing's widest spectrum, and ranging from the local French
regional teams to individuals from Peru and Senegal.
The field of British competitors, too, also is the largest in recent
years -- the result, perhaps, of the move to a later stage in the
season.
This feature alone means, from an athlete's point of view, that there
should be no excuses for poor performances.
In theory, it is hard to believe the name on the downhill title this
year will be any other than Bell, whether Martin or Graham.
This year, Martin, aged 30, has had mixed fortunes on a frustrating
World Cup tour which has been riddled with cancellations and
globe-spanning travel itineraries.
While for him, at least, the impetus to keep going at World Cup level
must be sorely tested, the opportunity to write his name into the
championships' history book should add a keen edge to his performance
this week.
He will be bidding to win the British Combined title for the fourth
time, a feat not yet achieved by a man in the 74-year history of the
event -- although he would be still one title adrift of Lesley Beck, who
has won the women's championship five times, having been unbeaten
between 1984 and 1987.
Graham Bell, 27, is acknowledged as weaker in the technical events --
slalom and giant slalom -- although he has won the overall championship
once in 1993.
But he has been consistently quicker than Martin this season and
glimpsed success in the Kitzbuhel World Cup, where he took nineteenth
place.
Both have been beaten on the lightly undulating, straightforward
Tignes course, where the best line is dictated by a couple of key turns.
In the past, their superior factory skis also have added to their edge
by a factor of up to one second.
Rising British-team downhiller Andrew Freshwater has beaten the
brothers in training and knows that this would be an equable platform to
show he has the potential to overtake them.
The defending British champion is Alain Baxter, like Freshwater, a
23-year-old from Aviemore, who took the title when the downhill was
cancelled last year because of bad weather. But he does have the
all-round strength across all four disciplines to retain his title.
Dunblane's Emma Carrick-Anderson will be defending her British Slalom
title and, for the first time in recent years, is racing in all four
disciplines. Equal measures of consistency in each would guarantee the
19-year-old her first British Combined title.
Highlight of the week is likely to be the new Home Nations Team
Parallel slalom, which closes the event next Saturday, an event which
Scotland should win comfortably.

'Working at Tynecastle with my best buddy in football was a really
enjoyable time because we knew what we wanted and how we should go about
getting it'
PERHAPS he is human enough to look at what has happened to Hearts
since he was dismissed four years ago and wonder if he could have done a
lot better, but it is not in Alex MacDonald's make-up to dwell on things
past, nor is he the type to harbour grudges.
He feels no bitterness at all towards the man who sent him packing,
Wallace Mercer, the same man who took him to Tynecastle 10 years
earlier. In his eyes Wallace might well have been influenced by others
''and acted on it'' but, whatever the reason, he has never felt any need
to carry anger around in his kit bag.
In fact, he still has chats with the Tynecastle secretary, Les
Porteous, he still keeps contact with players of his Hearts era, like
John Robertson and Gary Mackay, to whom he refers as ''good people''.
It is not the case, therefore, that there will be any special mission
out before his Airdrie players when they take on his old team at Hampden
in the Tennents Scottish Cup semi-final on April 8. The notion that he
would be proving a point did not apply when the teams met the year after
he was dismissed in the semis of the same competition. Airdrie won that
day but went on to lose to Rangers in the final.
The last time Hearts were in the final, 1985, they were under the
charge of MacDonald, who -- like all of the players, officials, and fans
of the club -- will be unable to forget the week when they lost to
Aberdeen in the cup after having missed the championship on goal
difference when they were beaten by Dundee at Dens Park.
Until now, he has never offered excuses for that last-day defeat and
would admit only now that a virus which had attacked the dressing room
may have had its effects.
''We had five players down with the virus, which had been going around
clubs that season. We actually went to pick up Craig Levein for the game
and he was in bed unable to travel. Brian Whittaker and Kenny Black were
affected, too, and we decided to put one of them on the bench to come on
and spell the other.''
The one decision he thinks he should have made was to play himself in
the circumstances, but he was not match fit and chose the alternative.
''Otherwise I would not change anything I did at Tynecastle or anywhere
else, for that matter.''
He would readily acknowledge that, in managerial terms, his happiest
days were when he and his former Ibrox team-mate, Sandy Jardine, ran the
show at Tynecastle. ''Working with my best buddy in football was a
really enjoyable time because we knew what we wanted and how we should
go about getting it.''
MacDonald, though fiercely competitive as a player and manager, has a
healthily pragmatic attitude towards the business as a whole. He
demonstrated that after he was dismissed by Hearts and spent nine months
out of the game, the only time in his adult life he was not involved
directly in football.
''To be honest, I actually enjoyed that period. It was a relief not to
have to look after a squad of players, to worry only about my family and
myself. It also taught me to realise there can be life after football.''
He has a wee chuckle when he remembers how he was collapsing under the
weight of sympathy. ''People were kind but it became embarrassing. I got
to the point where I thought I should carry a placard saying 'Yes, still
out of work', but instead went walks along the canal bank on my own.''
That experience, allied to his own pragmatic nature, has allowed
MacDonald to tackle his task with Airdrie in relatively relaxed style.
His great strength has always been to make players play up to and beyond
their capabilities and that talent will apply wherever he does his work.
In the season Airdrie went to that Scottish Cup final, they were
within touching distance of a place in the Skol Cup final, too, and
might well have made it, but for an error of judgment by referee Davie
Syme, who gave Dunfermline a penalty that wasn't.
MacDonald passes over that with the same shrug of the shoulders that
accompanies any other perceived misfortune along the way.
Nothing that has happened will take away the kick he gets out of
working with players, especially young ones, a joy he shared with
another former Ibrox colleague, the late Davie Cooper, whose brilliance
he recalled with unstinting admiration. ''Coop was absolutely
magnificent. He was a shy lad when he came to Rangers at first and it
was only in recent years that he came out of his shell a bit. What a
player he was, though.''
Like most ex-players, MacDonald misses playing more than anything else
but, unlike many others, he does so from a managerial standpoint, too.
''For me, there is nothing that can equal being able to tell players
what they did, right or wrong, moments after it has happened on the
park.
''You can see things on the park from an angle that you can't match in
the dug-out or the stand. On the field you can give a quick reassurance
to a young lad, for example, which works a lot better than doing it
after the game is over.''
His playing days were well rewarded, with four Scottish Cup winners'
medals, four League Cup, three League Championship badges, and a
European Cup-winners' Cup medal, and he went into the coaching side of
the game looking for a different kind of satisfaction, the sight of
players achieving their potential.
He would confess to wondering what it would have been like to spend
the really big money, a luxury he has not enjoyed in the manager's
chair, but can point to one or two shrewd bits of business in his own
right. The acquisition of Mike Galloway for #60,000 and his subsequent
transfer for #500,000 was good economics, while Dave McPherson was
bought from Rangers for #300,000 and sold back to them for #1m.
Alex can also recall trying to persuade Mercer to bid for Phil Babb,
then with Bradford City, who subsequently became an Irish
internationalist with Coventry City.
He has had to operate with even fewer resources at Airdrie and contend
with other problems that bigger clubs rarely face, like the walk-out of
two of his Anglos, Chris Honor and Wes Reid, both of whom simply took
off back south early this season.
MacDonald follows a simple philosophy which insists that he can sound
off at a noisy level to any of his players about their football
performance but precludes him from interfering in personal matters.
He is not one for paying much attention to criticism, either, and if
he reads this it will be a departure from his current habits. ''I don't
read newspapers. I haven't read them since I was a player at Ibrox, when
it upset me. I decided to do without that but I also try to protect my
players from stuff that I think is unfair.''
MacDonald knows just how much reaching the final would mean to the
current squad. ''They know there is nothing like being in a final now.
Getting there means it is a day out for the family, friends and
relatives, granny and everybody else.''
He claims he will be phoning Gary Mackay two days before the
semi-final to ''wind him up'' but, more seriously, believes reaching the
final would be perhaps a greater achievement than anything in his
managerial career to date.
He and Hearts' manager, Tommy McLean, are old pals from Ibrox days,
but ''can still ''fall out in the dug-out.''
It is feasible that Airdrie could meet Celtic in the final, thus
producing the first cup final between teams who have not played on their
own pitch all season. Unlike Celtic, however, Airdrie still await news
of their proposed new stadium and currently train at Strathclyde Park.
''We are grateful for the facilities but it is not quite the same as
your own place.''
MacDonald will not let it affect his players' commitment, just as he
accepts the arthritic pains in his knees as a consequence of playing the
game for much of his lifetime. ''I can hardly complain after the career
I have had, can I?''

LIZ McColgan will be absent from Durham today when the World Cross
Country Championships get under way. More's the pity, Britain deperately
needs a medal contender, but the former world 10,000 metres champion is
fine-tuning for the London Marathon next weekend.
Having been warned she might never run again, McColgan, typically, has
been provoked to train harder than at any time in her life. She is used
to being written off and is accustomed to turning negative vibes into a
positive incentive. But she is weary of being criticised for working too
hard.
The road and the miles to recovery for the Dundee athlete have been
long and painful. How far? The distance she is reluctant to give.''I
don't want to talk about it,'' she said, when I asked her to confirm my
belief that she recently approached 150 miles per week before cutting
back for London. But she effectively confirmed it: ''If the Chinese can
do it, so can I. I'm doing my own thing.''
McColgan has already proved her critics wrong with a catalogue of
honours unmatched by any UK endurance athlete, male or female. The
Chinese based their recent success on prodigious workloads, plus a
spartan life-style similar to that of the Kenyans, who are looking for
their tenth successive men's team win today.
The single-minded McColgan remains the last senior British athlete to
win a medal in this event: bronze in Antwerp (1992), just four months
after the birth of her daughter. No UK male or female looks capable of
emulating that this afternoon, though England's former world junior
winner, Paula Radcliffe, will be helped by a Durham course, and probable
muddy conditions, more akin to British traditions than the
billiard-table surfaces of recent years.
Britain may have given the sport to the world -- indeed, the inaugural
world championships were staged on Hamilton racecourse in 1903 -- but
the truth is that world endurance success, particularly on the country,
is more and more out of reach of Western athletes.
Radcliffe has spent much of the past year in Germany, training while
holding down a marketing job. She, too, is returning after prolonged
absence through injury, and her commitment is beyond reproach. But all
cosseted Westerners are immune to the rigours which only those from
developing nations can grasp. Despite sports science and technological
superiority, a basic life-style now seems a prerequisite of success.
McColgan, the product of a hard school -- a Tayside council estate and
YTS work in the jute mills -- is the only recent tangible proof that
Britons retain the ability to match nations who are beginning to unpick
our moral fibre. But even her background was less harsh than labouring
in the rice fields of Laoning or subsistence herding at altitude in East
Africa's Rift Valley. Put a Kenyan on any start-line, and it is not only
the Caucasians who are paralysed as if stricken by some voodoo talisman.
So what does it take to beat the Kenyan men? One of the few to know
the answer is Ethiopian Haile Gebresilasie, named after the Lion of
Judah, his country's last emperor. Gebresilasie was aged just 20 when he
won the 10,000 metres title at the 1993 World championships in
Stuttgart, controversially outsprinting Kenya's Moses Tanui after
clipping his heels and ripping off one of his spikes. Just a few days
earlier, the young policeman had finished runner-up to another Kenyan,
Ismael Kirui, in the 5000m.
''He knows life-style has a great deal to do with success,'' said
Gebresilasie's agent, Dutchman Jos Hermens. ''The Mercedes car which was
his prize for the 10,000 metres win in Stuttgart is still sitting in a
garage in Adis Abeba,'' says Hermens. ''Haile believes that having a car
makes you lazy. He hasn't got a license, so there is a practical force
to it. But he says that is why he has not taken lessons. It makes you
too keen to jump in the car -- makes you soft.
''As a child he ran to school every day, about 10,000 metres each way.
Haile recognises his people have advantages as runners, that Westerners
are over-fat, eat too much food as children.''
Gebresilasie, notionally still a policeman but in reality a full-time
athlete, has moved his family from a rural area into Adis. His mother
and sister have recently died, and his running provides the income for
his father and five brothers.
His relationship with his national federation is uneasy. It was they
who made him run both 5000m and 10,000m in Stuttgart, attempting a
double last achieved by Lasse Viren in the 1976 Olympics. ''They put
terrible pressure on him,'' says Hermens. ''They haven't a clue.''
Troubles in his homeland make Gabresilasie's frequent visits fraught.
The rest of the time he lives at Uden, Holland. One of his brothers, who
is seeking political asylum, lives there with him. Most inhabitants of
the house are runners. The Kenyans often stay with them, exploding the
myth that they can't get on with Ethiopians.
''Despite that controversy over the 10,000 metres, Moses Tanui has
shared the house with Gebresilassie, and they get on fine,'' adds
Hermens. ''They live very simply, prepare all their own food. Their only
real luxury is TV.''
On each of his half-dozen trips home each year, Gebresilasie returns
with traditional Ethiopian produce. When it is exhausted he lives mainly
on pasta and rice. ''Very occasionally he will eat out as a treat.
Where? He goes to McDonald's.''
But Gebreselasie has put his finger on the West's running disease.
First father buys a car; then learns to drive it. He drives his kids to
school. Later he buys a TV. His children graduate to videos and computer
games. A couple of generations later, the kids are indolent couch
potatoes.
Britain's next cross-country medal may have to wait untill Western
civilisation and its luxury trappings have eroded the primitive armour
which keeps Third World runners ahead of the pack.

<HEADLINE>ANM Group reveals #820,000 profit</HEADLINE>

THE farmers' co-operative AMN Group, which includes Aberdeen and
Northern Marts and Scotch Premier Meat, has turned in a trading profit
of #820,000, according to its annual report issued yesterday.
The results represented a very respectable financial performance, said
chairman, George Ritch in his report.
Throughput increased in value from #191.7m in 1993 to #231.98m last
year. The board is recommending a 7.25% dividend on share capital -- the
maximum permitted under the society's rules. It is proposed to transfer
#730,000 to reserves.
Chief executive Brian Pack said the past year had been one of great
achievement, especially for their meat business -- Scotch Premier. The
group had invested #300,000 in that business and spent a further
#700,000 on restructuring after the purchase of plants at Inverurie and
Edinburgh from Hillsdown Holdings.
It was an area to which he would look for future growth, he said. The
#211,000 profit on the meat side was still a good figure -- although
substantially down on last year's #909,000, he added.
The core business, Aberdeen and Northern Marts, returned a profit of
#406,000 despite operating what it claims as one of the lowest
commission rates in Scotland -- 2.75% for livestock and 2.50% for
slaughter cattle. Charging higher rates in line with some competitors
could have earned the company an additional #600,000, said Mr Pack,
''but we try to maintain commission rates at a level which is in our
members' interests''.
He appealed to the 8000 farmer members to give their full support to
the co-operative which they owned. ''We believe that a strong group
owned by farmers is strategically important, as the energy spent in
ensuring a successful business helps to guarantee the future for its
members,'' said Mr Pack.
''We would hope that when farmers decide where to place their trade,
their own business will be the first choice.''
After a spell of growth through acquisition, the group's aim now was
for organic expansion within its various businesses, said Mr Pack. He
did not, however, rule out further expansion by acquisition if the right
opportunity arose.
Part of the future effort in Scotch Premier Meat would be to drive up
exports, he said. ''In our original meat business exports represented
22% of our trade. The figure dropped to 10% on expansion and we are
looking to redress that balance in the enlarged meat operation.'' Export
directors have been appointed in France and Italy.
The company is promoting its Scotch Premier brand at wholesale level
and with individual High Street butchers. They are also suppliers to
Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco and Safeway. The Tesco takeover of William Low's
offered real opportunities for growth, said Mr Pack, the company hoped
to take full advantage of that.
The mart's non-agricultural activities include machinery sales, a
Sunday market, car auctions and furniture sales.

THE Scottish Agricultural College has won an additonal #155,000 from
the European Rural Development Fund to enable it to employ more staff to
conduct farm audits in the Highlands and Islands.
The audits will be used to support applications for aid from the #23m
Highlands and Islands Agriculture Programme.
The college's north advisory area director, Jim Seton, said resource
audits were required for the programme and there had been concern that
farmers and crofters were not going to get their applications in quickly
enough.
''We have already drafted in 11 extra advisers from outside the
Objective 1 area to help get things moving,'' he said. ''It is expected
that about 1700 crofters and farmers could qualify for a share of this
money and our existing staff are working round the clock to get these
audits done.''
The Agricultural Business Improvement Scheme provides funds of up to
#20,000 for applicants who can demonstrate that the money will improve
the income-generating potential of their farm, maintain rural
employment, and enhance the environment.
Applications have to be backed by a resource audit and business
assessment, which normally takes two days to complete and costs #500.
Half of the fee is met by the Scottish Office Agriculture Department.
''These audits are of crucial importance and can only be carried out
by organisations with considerable expertise in the economy of
agricultural and rural businesses,'' said Mr Seton. ''The Scottish
Office needs to see evidence of specific benefits before they will agree
to the European funding.''
With 40% grants for buildings and up to 70% for some environmental
measures the scheme could prove a real boost for many businesses, he
said.
''The Highlands and Islands have a justified reputation for the
quality of their produce but they have a tough climate for farming and
deserve all the help we can give them.''
Meanwhile, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has won an assurance that there
will be an early release of #125m worth of ERDF assistance for the
Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, and parts of Tayside and Grampian.
Under Objective 5b Assistance for Rural Areas, the European Commission
will give backing to agricultural diversification, investment in
forestry, environmental schemes and heritage projects. Assistance will
also be given to small businesses generally including increased
tele-working and technology transfer.
The National Farmers' Union of Scotland welcomed Mr Lang's
announcement of the early release of European funds. NFUS president John
Ross said his organisation had campaigned hard for the programme and
wanted farmers to be able to take advantage of the money as soon as
possible. The #10.5m earmarked for agricultural diversification would be
of considerable benefit to rural communities in the qualifying areas, he
added.

IF you were sufficiently well organised to get your 1994/5 personal
equity plan arranged earlier in this financial year you may be wishing
you had not. It has not been the happiest of years for investors. But at
least you would be spared the problem of deciding what on earth to do
now. The last minute rush to take up investment rations of #6000 into a
general PEP and #3000 into a single company one has to end by April 5.
Cheques need to be in before then as a PEP needs cleared funds.
There is still a little time left though so the problem remains: where
should the money go?
If you cannot be sure that the Footsie, which started the week in fine
form, is now definitely headed upwards, you can still sit on the fence
without losing your current year PEP ration. All you need do is find a
stockbroker who is also a PEP manager. He or she will almost certainly
allow you to put the cash into the PEP and leave it there -- gathering
tax-free interest -- until you have decided which shares, investment
trusts or unit trusts to buy.
The interest will remain tax-free so long as you eventually do use the
cash to buy shares. The Inland Revenue, which trawls round brokers'
offices checking up on these things, will charge you tax on the interest
if you withdraw the cash without using it to buy shares. Under current
rules there is no time limit on this, although for a single company PEP
you have only 42 days' grace before the money has to be invested.
While PEPs have mopped up some #20bn of investors' cash, there are
reckoned to be a fair number of people who have not yet plucked up the
courage for what is essentially an investment in shares. They prefer
safer but less exciting homes for their cash.
The Government has now promised that from next year corporate bonds,
which generally offer higher immediate income, effectively fixed at the
time of purchase, can be included in PEPs. Precise details are still
awaited so they are not expected to be available until some time in May,
although the new PEP year starts on April 6.
These bands are generally reckoned to be pretty safe, with the values
likely to fluctuate up and down with the general level of interest rates
or, in the case of securities convertible into Ordinary shares, with the
fate of the underlying shares.
However, the collapse of Barings has pointed out that corporate bonds
are not necessarily as safe as they might have appeared. Hopefully such
crashes will be rare, but the message is not to put all your eggs into
just one basket.
If corporate bond PEPs are what you fancy, you do not necessarily have
to lose the chance of taking up this year's PEP ration. No one is
beating the drum about it but, unless the final rules prohibit it, you
may well find a broker PEP manager who is prepared to take your cash and
invest in corporate bonds next tax year when you will also be allowed
another #6000 worth.
But for the puzzled investor agonising over which way the market is
going and worrying about putting all the cash into shares at just the
wrong time, there are other ways of dealing with the problem. A popular
method of investing is to drip-feed cash into the market month by month.
A lot of people buy unit or investment trusts this way. It means that
you buy more shares or units in months when the market is low and fewer
when it is riding high. Most managers of investment or unit trusts offer
such schemes for around #50 a month upwards.
The steady flow of money is reckoned to have been one of the ways in
which investment trusts narrowed the discounts between their market
prices and the value of their underlying investments. And unit trust
managers always like to see a flow of new money which enables them to
buy the shares they feel are the most promising at the time without
necessarily having to sell others. Not many offer the facility for PEP
holders however.
One group which does is Henderson T R where Richard Eats says: ''It is
more popular in years like this when people are feeling a little
nervous.''
With Henderson you can chose between nine investment trusts including
Witan, one of the biggest general trusts currently standing on a
discount, and 10 unit trusts. The cash can be drip-fed into your chosen
vehicle over three, six or 12 months. And Eats says: ''If you think the
market is going to go up in a straight line you can change your mind and
have all the remaining money invested within a couple of days.''
Murray Johnstone will take a #6000 lump sum now for the 1994/5 PEP and
drip-feed it into any one of its six PEPable unit trusts over 12 months.
Richard Eliott Lockhart reminds investors that the unspent cash is
invested to earn interest at money market rates, and says that with
Murray Johnstone too you can stop at any time and put the remaining
balance into your chosen fund.
He says that last year there was little interest in drip-feeding but
this year ''it is completely different''.
As an example of the benefit, he says that, taking February 1, 1994 as
the investment date, #6000 put into the Murray Equity Income Trust,
which performed better than average in its sector, would have had a
value of #4944 by February 1 this year. Phased investment shows a
smaller loss with a value of #5635. And while the single lump sum bought
only 5314 units in 1994, phased investment gave a PEP holder 6282 units
by February this year.
''The figures are quite surprising,'' he comments. ''We found in fact
that in three of the past five years phased investment was the most
effective method, particularly for the uninitiated investor.''

MANY investors who put money into unit or investment trusts around
this time last year must be feeling they have been cheated. Tempted to
transfer savings out of bank and building society accounts by higher
incomes, the prospect of capital growth, or both, they have seen their
investments fall in value instead.
On average, unit and investment trusts are now worth around 15% less
than they were a year ago, after buying expenses have been taken into
account. Interest rates on many bank and building society accounts, on
the other hand, have risen three times over the same period.
It is rather unfortunate, therefore, that the Association of
Investment Trust Companies did not bring out its new guide to investment
risk earlier. Its opening remark -- ''When you select an investment, it
is unlikely to turn out quite as you expected'' -- might have made some
investors stop and think.
Although unit and investment trust managers must give an obligatory
wealth warning on all their advertisements and brochures that the value
of your investments can go down as well as up, most investors --
sweet-talked into the joys of stock market investment -- undoubtedly
expected that after a year their returns would have been better than
those from their bank or building society account, not worse.
The challenge for the unit and investment trust industries now is to
reassure investors, to get them to sit tight and wait for results to
come through over the medium to long term. Five years is really the
minimum period for which an equity investment should be made. If you
were encouraged to put money into unit or investment trusts that you
might need earlier then you have been wrongly advised.
All the same, if the fall in your investment is making you feel unsure
about continuing with it, the AITC's free guide, entitled Making Risk
Work For You, should help to put the current situation in perspective.
Risk usually refers to the likelihood that you may lose money on your
investments. But according to the guide's author, Dr David Fleming, the
problem is not just of downside risk. He argues that, in the context of
investment, risk means uncertainty, and this is the chief reason why
investors in shares can expect a better return on their money than they
would get if they simply deposited their money in a savings account.
''The more uncertain an investment is, the greater the return you want
to get from it in compensation for your trouble,'' he says.
He explains that investors can use risk to their advantage by
spreading their investments, beginning with minimal risk and building up
to those which offer greater rewards for taking on a higher risk level.
But investors must be in a position to assess how much risk surrounds an
investment, and this is not always easy.
A few investment managers risk-rate their products. On the investment
trust side, Fleming, Foreign &amp; Colonial and Kleinwort Benson have
risk-rated their trusts, while Gartmore has done the same with its unit
trusts. But most companies leave investors to figure out the risks for
themselves.
For Dr Fleming, assessing the risk of an investment means ''knowing
how much you don't know about it''. He suggests three ways in which you
can measure this uncertainty. One is to look at how much the price of an
investment moves up and down; another is to examine the definition of
the investment, and the third is to look at its case history.
Price volatility can be measured by standard deviation. This shows how
it fluctuates around the general trend. The higher the number the more
volatile the fund. This is useful because it has a tendency to remain
roughly constant for a long time.
In future, the AITC will be providing standard deviation for
investment trusts in its Monthly Information Service. The statistical
service Micropal already provides three-year volatility figures for unit
trusts. Lowest on the scale are the cash funds which have an average
volatility of 0.16. Most volatile are the Far Eastern funds at 8.38,
with UK balanced funds around the halfway point at 4.34.
However, Dr Fleming stresses that you cannot rely on a formula alone,
personal judgments must also be made. This is why the definition of an
investment must be considered. In the case of investment trusts, he
points out that the investment objectives, sector and structure of a
trust must be taken into account. In addition, investors should look at
a trust's case history -- its performance and any recent events
affecting it, such as a change of management.
Assessing risk is not easy. Even deposit accounts in bank or building
societies are not risk-free, since the relatively low level of return
they offer may not be enough to protect your money against inflation.
The only risk-free investment currently available is Index-Linked
National Savings Certificates. These guarantee that your money keeps
pace with inflation and give you extra interest on top. But Dr Fleming
says: ''If you do everything in your power to avoid risk, you will have
to bear the cost of this in the form of a reduced return on your
investment. It therefore makes sense to face up to the existence of risk

MORTGAGES by phone may have sparked off a brand new price war among
lenders, but they look unlikely to revitalise the flagging first-time
buyer market.
Latest figures from the building societies show that lending in
February was 17% lower than in the same month last year, and loans in
the pipleline for the next few months are well down too.
There's not much to encourage hopes of a spring revival in the housing
market either. Next month tax relief on mortgages is to be cut from 20%
to 15%, and later in the year income support for home buyers who lose
their jobs is being curtailed too.
While fixing up a mortgage by phone is clearly attractive to those who
have been through the house buying process before, first-time buyers
could be left out in the cold.
The telephone-based services typically offer maximum loans of 85% of a
property's value -- only 75% at Bradford &amp; Bingley -- which rules out
hard-pressed first-time buyers who have little set aside for a deposit.
House prices in Scotland now stand at an average of just over #49,000,
according to building society figures, implying a deposit of #7350 for a
first-timer offered only an 85% loan.
Thousands of first-time buyers -- who provide an impetus for the rest
of the house-buying market -- decided against moving into home ownership
at the end of last year. Bank figures suggest that only 40% of new loans
were to first-timers in the last three months of 1994, compared to the
last quarter of 1993 when they accounted for half the total.
While first-time buyers may still be reluctant to take on the
commitment of a mortgage, established home owners are more than happy to
switch their loans from one organisation to another in search of the
best deal -- a process that has become even easier with the arrival of
mortgages by phone.
We've all become used to the idea of arranging car insurance in this
way since Direct Line and its tooting red telephone first hit the scene
a decade ago. Established insurance companies were soon forced to follow
suit as it became clear that we were all prepared to shop around by
phone -- without, it seems, feeling a shred of loyalty for our previous
insurer.
Now Direct Line is trying the same trick with mortgages, encouraged by
a pilot scheme among its existing insurance customers which attracted
#100m of new home loan business in just six months. Most of Direct
Line's customers have been borrowers transferring their mortgages from
higher-rate lenders, but other telephone lenders report that there are
just as many people moving house who are prepared to fix a loan by
phone.
In contrast to the huge range of different mortgage products now on
offer from building societies -- that leave first-time buyers bothered
and bewildered, but rarely bewitched -- Direct Line has just one simple
repayment mortgage.
At a rate of 7.42% it undercuts it parent, the Royal Bank of Scotland,
and most major building societies by around 1%. For example, that means
a monthly payment of just under #334 on a #60,000 loan against just over
#375 for a standard Halifax loan, currently at 8.35%.
While the Direct Line rate is higher than some of the special discount
mortgage deals available, its simplicity will appeal to many. There is
no arrangement fee, no need to take out new insurance, a free standard
valuation and no early redemption charges.
Special discount schemes from building societies mean lower interest
payments for a year or so, but can involve a host of other charges
including arrangement fees and compulsory insurance. Another drawback of
these schemes is that although you enjoy a low rate for a year or so,
you could be stuck with the lender for much longer than that.
Penalty charges used to be made during the term of the discount or
fixed rate. Now most lenders impose a penalty well beyond the end of
your discount term. This makes it expensive to take advantage of any
discount offer then available -- at a time when your loan has reverted
to the much higher standard rate.
First-time buyers taking out a mortgage at the Royal Bank are being
offered a discount of 4.5% on the normal mortgage rate until January
next year, for instance. But if that borrower wants to switch to another
loan before April 1998 the discount has to be repaid.
Because new telephone-based organisations, such as Direct Line's
operation in Glasgow, don't have expensive branch networks to pay for
they can afford to undercut their bigger rivals and still make a healthy
profit. The average profit margin for big High Street lenders is around
2%, but telephone lenders reckon they can make a decent living by paring
this to 1% or less.
It took a while for established motor and household insurers to
respond to the threat posed by telephone selling, but mortgage lenders
are determined to be quicker off the mark. Bradford &amp; Bingley's
telephone-based Mortgages Direct opened for business at the beginning of
this month and took 2000 calls from home buyers in the first week alone.
Its interest rate is 7.3% and there is a #300 refund on completion to
cover legal fees.
Bank of Scotland launched its own Mortgages Direct service four months
ago and has attracted more than #200m of business since then on an
interest rate of 7.34%. The Bank of Scotland's telephone mortgage
service is unusual in also offering 100% loans to potential borrowers,
albeit at a higher interest rate of 8.34%.
First Direct, the telephone banking arm of Midland Bank, has been
offering mortgages since it was launched in 1989. Competition in the
market has just brought its mortgage rate down from 8.34% to 7.39%.

BRITAIN came close to break-even on the current account of its balance
of payments last year, and in the second half a substantial surplus of
#1995m was recorded.
Last night some independent economists were contemplating the prospect
of a surplus this year, the first since the #2200m recorded in 1985, but
the figures are too erratic to permit reliable forecasting.
City analysts had thought that the previously reported third-quarter
surplus of #492m had been something of a freak and were not expecting a
repetition.
In the event, the third-quarter surplus was revised up to #1367m and
the fourth quarter produced an unexpected surplus of #628m.
For the year as a whole the current account deficit was just #168m, a
massive turn-round from 1993's #11.8bn. As recently as the end of
November the Treasury had forecast a deficit of #4000m.
Most of the improvement arose from a dramatic upsurge in invisible
earnings from City services and overseas investment.
Invisibles had contributed just #1549m to the balance of payments in
1993, but last year this figure soared to #10.4bn.
There were a number of factors at play, but the most important was a
jump in investment income from #1620m to #11.2bn, dwarfing the previous
record surplus of #4600m in 1986.
The huge investment surplus was mainly attributable to an upsurge in
the overseas profits of British companies and reduced net interest
payments by British banks.
This could turn out be an enduring feature of Britain's balance of
payments, but the figures, which are appallingly difficult to measure,
are subject to substantial revisions and are notoriously erratic.
The traditional surplus on services, such as insurance, banking, and
tourism, actually retreated from #5213m to #4759m.
The other main element in the greatly reduced current account balance
was a reduction in the visible trade deficit from #13.4bn in 1993 to
#10.5bn last year as British exporters made hay and imports were
virtually static for much of the year.
But the visible trade deficit rose from #1829m in the third quarter to
#2945m in the fourth as imports staged a recovery.
The invisibles surplus increased in the fourth quarter to a record
#3573m from #3196m in the third. But this was more than accounted for by
a #900m drop in the deficit on transfers, mainly to the EU, to #743m.
This was clearly a special factor which will not be sustained.
Transfers to the EU are on a rising trend, and the reduced payment in
the fourth quarter is likely to be clawed back in future transactions.
British Invisibles, a trade promotion body, was quick to underline the
contribution of its members.
Its economic adviser, Jill Leyland, said: ''Earnings from direct
investments abroad were so good, with Britain being one of the leaders
in this field, and also because banks having been paying out less
interest on their borrowings abroad.''
British companies have been building up their overseas investments in
recent years, especially in the United States. Profits from these
activities are burgeoning as the global recovery has gained momentum.
The Treasury's forecast for this year's current account is a deficit
of #3500m, but too much has happened since the mandarins crushed the
numbers. Goldman Sachs' David Walton does not expect the surplus to be
maintained. He is forecasting modest deficits of #4000m for this year
and next, which he says would not be troublesome.
The pound took heart from the balance of payments figures and from a
huge purchase of sterling by Glaxo to help meet the cash cost of
acquiring Wellcome. It gained 1.24 pfennigs to DM2.2518, but lost 0.42
cents to $1.5888 as the dollar staged a brave rally against the mark.
The trade weighted index added 0.4 to 85.6.
The National Accounts confirmed that the economy grew by 0.8% in the
fourth quarter, but the figures for each of the first three quarters
were revised up by 0.1%. So year-on-year growth reached 4.2% against the
3.9% originally estimated. Effectively this further narrows the output
gap, which may at some stage tip the scales in favour of an increase in
interest rates.
Retail sales made little headway in the final quarter, but consumers'
expenditure gained momentum. The 0.8% rise was supported by the National
Lottery and holidaying abroad.

ABERDEEN-based GRT Bus Group yesterday announced plans to enter into a
partnership with council-owned Nottingham City Transport.
The deal would involve NCT, which operates 450 buses in and around
Nottingham, taking a stake in GRT.
A minority holding in NCT, which would remain largely owned by
Nottingham City Council, would pass to GRT. Discussions between the
parties have commenced.
GRT said the arrangement confirmed its commitment to working in
partnership and forming strategic alliances with local authorities to
develop transport networks and new initiatives.
Nottingham is a new patch for GRT, whose operations include Grampian
Transport, Midland Bluebird, Leicester CityBus, Northampton Transport,
Eastern Counties, SMT, Lowland Omnibuses, Mairs Coaches, and Kirkpatrick
of Deeside.
GRT executive chairman Moir Lockhead said it was a tremendous
opportunity to work with Nottingham City Transport's management in
developing the transport network, with the Aberdeen company providing
some of the purchasing benefits of a larger group.
He added: ''Geographically this is a new area for us and, as such,
offers a fresh challenge.''
GRT shares closed unchanged at 256p.

IAN Grant, chairman of the Scottish Tourist Board is flying out for a
whirlwind tour of the US on Monday which will see him take in three
cities in four days.
He will be accompanied by the STB's director of publicity, Graham
Birse, and piper Willie Cochrane. The trio will be using the forthcoming
premiere of the film Rob Roy to sell Scotland as a tourist destination
to Americans.
First stop will be Boston then it will be on to Chicago and New York,
where they will attend previews of the film in the company of the elite
of the US journalistic corp.
The Scottish premiere of the film, which stars Liam Neeson and Jessica
Lange, will be on May 14 in Edinburgh.
Before packing his bags in readiness for his Stateside visit Graham
Birse told me: ''MGM have kindly made seats available to the press
previews for travel writers invited by ourselves, which means we will
have the travel editors of the New York Times and the Boston Globe in
attendance.''
The STB has already seen rushes of the film and believes it is a great
advert for the Highlands, including stunning views of Rannoch Moor,
Glencoe, Glen Nevis and Loch Lochy to name but a few.
Visitors sent
to Coventry
VISITORS to next month's Scottish Travel Fair are being sent to
Coventry.
The fair which is being held in the SECC in Glasgow on April 26 and 27
attracts travel agents and tour operators from all over the world, but
when applying to attend they have to write to a firm in Moore Street,
Coventry.
Explaining the use of an English firm to distribute credentials for a
Scottish travel fair, a Scottish Tourist Board spokesman said: ''We use
companies who have the right expertise to do the job, and in this case
it was a company in Coventry.''
Goodwin gets
his Berings
FRED Goodwin, who is quitting his post as chief operations officer in
charge of the BCCI liquidation to become deputy chief executive at the
Clydesdale Bank next month, may wonder what he has got himself into when
he hears staff talking about their Bering House HQ at Clydebank.
But he can relax. It is not a case of out of the frying pan into the
fire. It is just the pronunciation which is the same. Bering House has
no connection with the collapsed Barings Bank. It is the Clydesdale's
branch service centre HQ.
A signature
of some note
WE can't get away from names this week. Most banks are quite content
to have only one signature on their bank notes, normally that of their
general manager or chief executive, but it seems that for many years the
Royal Bank of Scotland had two names on its #1 notes.
It appears that during the mid-fifites WH Egan, an apprentice engraver
with W &amp; AK Johnston Ltd, took a very personal interest in the Royal
Bank notes printed by the company.
The young Egan etched his signature on to the reverse side of the
notes before emigrating to North America. The notes were produced until
1967 but the second signature escaped notice until 1989 when he returned
to Scotland for a visit, and called in to the Royal Bank's head office
to confess.
He politely explained to the chief cashier what he had been up to as a
young apprentice, and asked if he could have some of the notes to show
friends back home his handiwork.
The Egan signature in the forecourt of the Glasgow chief office
portrayed on the note had gone completely undetected, and an astonished
Royal Bank chief cashier exchanged some notes with him for those of the
required vintage.
This delightful tale is told in this month's Antiques Bulletin by
Trevor Jones, managing director of Banking Memorabilia.
He tells us that at present collectors can buy a good example of the
note for #10, but that with its new notoriety the value could very well
rise.
WH Egan obviously had an artistic bent, for when he emigrated he
became an actor in the TV Western series The Virginian.
Address chaos
for Chamber
STAFF at the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce were delighted with the
smooth way their temporary removal last year from their George Square
premises had gone.
Despite moving to Classic House in Renfield Street while their home at
30 George Square was being refurbished, it was a case of business as
usual. The chamber kept the same phone number and address throughout,
and it was only personal callers who realised that it was not in its
normal abode.
A few months ago it moved back into George Square, many people never
realising it had been away.
That is until BT took a hand! The new Glasgow phone book gives the
chamber's address as Classic House and mail is now arriving there -- and
having to be diverted back to George Square.
One member of staff remarked: ''We don't know where they picked up the

New town talks
about future
EAST Kilbride Business Forum had a successful meeting earlier this
week when local businesses, councillors and representatives from
Lanarkshire Development Agency gathered in the Stakis Westpoint Hotel.
More than 70 attended the meeting which discussed a number of areas of
concern for the new town. These included its dependency on inward
investment, the branch plant economy with external ownership of a large
part of the company base and, linked with this, the low indigenous
company formation.
Brian Bonnar, a senior partner in Ross Harper who is chairman of the
new town's business forum, told Business Diary that there would be a
further meeting in May. This will focus on current developments in East
Kilbride concerning the ownership of property being sold off by the
Development Corporation, which is being wound down by the Government
along with the other new town corporations.
Your chance to
save money
THERE are always plenty of comments flying around about how the
Government wastes our money, but we get few opportunities to tell the
powers that be how they could become more efficient.
Ernst &amp; Young is again sponsoring a competition organised by the Adam
Smith Institute to allow the public to air their suggestions as to how
Government departments could be more cost effective.
Finalists in the Economy in Government competition will have the
opportunity to formulate their ideas into ''business plans'' with the
help of management consultants from Ernst &amp; Young.
The overall winner receives #1500 and the runners up #250, with all
the finalists being invited to the awards lunch in October, when
Jonathan Aitken, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, will present the
prizes.
The competition is now in its third year, but the only competitor from
Scotland to reach the finals so far is Squadron Leader Mark Nash, who
was based at Lossiemouth.
He was one of the eight finalists in 1993 with his entry ''A plan to
improve the effectiveness, efficiency and economy of training in the
Royal Air Force''.
You can obtain competition entry information from the Adam Smith
Institute, 23 Great Smith Street, London SW1P 3BL. The closing date for
entries is Friday, June 30.

THE newly elected president of the Scottish Timber Trade Association
is Jimmy Forrest! The name struck a chord with me when I received a
press release this week headed ''Time to redress the Imbalance says
Timber's Mr Forrest''.
The imbalance he is speaking of is the ''ill-founded concerns about
deforestation and timber importation''.
During 1995, he says, he is going to help us see the ''wood for the
trees'', which must be a lot easier for him  than for the rest of us.

YOU'RE planning a new venture -- an expansion, a different product or
service, or maybe a new country or market. It's big in relation to the
size of your business, in terms of both people and funds.
In best entrepreneurial tradition you have attempted to quantify the
downside, the damage that would be done if it all went horribly wrong.
You believe such a disaster to be survivable even if you lost every
penny of the investment.
But that knowledge does not prevent you losing sleep over the
dimensions of the challenge. It's a hell of a risk. So, how can you
mitigate that risk, or even eliminate it?
For the right person, running the right company, that is not as
impossible as it sounds. Research in the US shows that the most
successful new ventures succeed because their backers were thoroughly
creative in their approach to planning and structuring the project.
Indeed, such creativity lies at the heart of most enterprising
companies. From the outset they do things differently from the
competition which more often than not involves larger, more bureaucratic
organisations.
I suppose our company could claim to fall into this category. It's not
as if we have consciously tried to be different in search of a
competitive edge, just that we don't know any other way -- it's how we
began.
This instinctively different approach tends to be an unrecognised
strength of growing companies. Often they do not appreciate just how
important a factor this creativity has been in gaining their market
position -- they become used to doing things successfully without any
real challenge from competitors.
This is the key to expansion without risk. It is at least partly true
that risk is an attitude of mind rather than commercial reality. Worry
about a development, foresee all that could go wrong, and quite often
you will not be disappointed. Such anticipation often generates a fait
accompli.
Again, US research among the fastest growing companies shows that
leading entrepreneurs do not hold with taking risks -- for the simple
reason that they perceive no risk in their plans.
They believe so passionately in what they are doing that the resultant
energy and confidence drives the project unrelentingly forward. Sure, it
can also end up being driven into the sea.
It is not nice to re-open old wounds, but I always recall being told a
few years back by David Murray that he would never embark on any venture
unless the maximum downside had been soundly calculated and could be
covered. He was speaking in the context of the imminent launch of his
Sunday Scot newspaper in the face of near-unanimous disbelief by media
pundits.
If it all goes wrong, and we never sell a copy or an advert, it will
cost me #2.5m, he said. As we now know, the collapse of the paper after
just 17 issues cost Murray International some #12m. Combined with a
subsequent slump in property values, this forced a radical restructuring
of the group. Perhaps more seriously still, it also took the shine off
Murray's reputation as Scotland's most successful entrepreneur. So he
paid a very high price for believing passionately in the project and,
perhaps, ignoring the very real risks involved.
So, how do you minimise your particular risk and become focussed on
success? Begin by analysing the components of that risk. Does it stem
from new products, markets, people -- or a frightening combination of
all three? If so, can you do it differently to eliminate at least one of
these factors?
How does the competition operate? Can you find someone who has
experience of that particular market who would be able to advise you how
to get around the barriers to entry?
How long before you run out of cash? Are there mechanisms you could
deploy to reduce that risk, boosting cashflow to fund a faster roll-out
or finding a partner already active in the market?
There are always options, always different ways to do things. As you
ponder them, remember this: the newcomer holds most of the aces. It is
up to him or her to set the pace and call the shots, to put the
competition on the back foot, stubbornly refusing to acknowledge there
is anything seriously risky involved.
When you come to think about it, it is only the supremely ignorant or
the supremely arrogant who can take such an attitude. Fact is, as often
as not, it is the arrogant who succeed these days.

We run a competitive business in a professional way but we try not to
do it in a bloodthirsty way. We believe in good relations with our
employees, suppliers and customers
FOR a man with leftward leaning political views to have to announce
2200 redundancies must be particularly painful, but Chris Haskins,
chairman of Northern Foods, has never flinched from taking difficult
management decisions, the latest deriving from the changes occurring in
food distribution as the big supermarkets tighten their grip.
Northern Foods has 24% of the total milk market, supplying all the
major supermarket chains and 21% of that delivered to doorsteps. It is
the largest supplier to Marks &amp; Spencer and the supermarkets of the
prepared meals which have become so popular in recent years. It also
provides smaller shops with products such as pies and sausages.
Doorstep delivery and the corner shop have been shattered by the much
lower prices supermarkets charge. As a result of the decline in demand,
the company has been forced to cut costs drastically, with the 2200
redundancies declared on Thursday following 1250 which had already been
announced.
Haskins is a believer in free markets and competition. He could hardly
have built up Northern Foods in the way he has if it were otherwise, but
he would undoubtedly prefer capitalism with a human face, and he felt at
odds with the Thatcherite creed.
It is such a surprise to find a man with self-professed leftward
leanings heading one of Britain's top 100 quoted companies that his
radicalism can be exaggerated.
Haskins did have radical opinions once -- in his youth he took part in
CND marches and was ''thrown out'' of the Labour Party for his views
even though he was not actually a paid-up member. But this radicalism
was more a symptom of youth than of conviction.
However, the drift to the right which so often happens with age has
not progressed far in his case and he has maintained left of centre
views. He is an admirer of the social market economy practised in Europe
and abhors free market extremism. So he is right behind Tony Blair's
attempt to modernise the Labour Party.
''The actions being taken are very encouraging and give Labour the
best chance it has had in 30 years of taking power at the next
election,'' he says.
He has clearly had some unofficial input into policy as one of the few
Labour supporters in the top echelons of business. ''I know the present
leadership and we meet and chat from time to time,'' he admits.
However, as a business leader he can not afford to ignore the present
Government and he appears to get on sufficiently well with ministers to
serve on committees, one for William Waldegrave looking at reform of the
Common Agriculture Policy and another for John Gummer on the
environment.
In fact, he thinks the Government is pursuing basically the right
economic policy of keeping inflation in check by reining back domestic
demand and enabling exporters to flourish. In the past he has been
critical of the lurch in the balance of power between trade unions and
big business, which took place with a change of Government and ruled out
consensus in almost any policy field. He is now hopeful of a more
constructive attitude from all sides.
He hopes John Major's Government won't spoil things by giving in to
the temptation of trying to bribe the electorate by cutting taxes too
much. He believes it essential that a future Labour administration puts
investment before consumption. He clearly feels Mr Blair will follow a
prudent policy.
Haskins is an approachable and easy going man with a certain sartorial
casualness. But as is often the case with such people, the inner core is
inaccessible and, according to colleagues, the reserve is increasing.
Perhaps there is a degree of disappointment that the world has not
turned out more humane than it has, but the way he dominates Northern
Foods suggests disenchantment has not arrived yet, though he would no
doubt be quite happy to concentrate on his 800 acre farm if
circumstances occasioned this.
He certainly did not start out with a burning ambition to become a top
businessman. His initial career ideas of being a farmer in his native
Wicklow or a journalist were thwarted, and he started working with De La
Rue, the banknote printer. Boredom prompted rebellion and he ended up
being fired. The next job, in Ford's personnel department, was more
successful. This was at the time when strikes were two a penny so it
proved far more exciting than his previous employment.
The big break really came when his father-in-law, Alec Horsley, asked
him to join the family firm, Northern Dairies. His first task was to
shake-up a string of dairies in Northern Ireland and from then he never
looked back.
He got on well with his brother-in-law Nicholas Horsley, and for a
time they ran the group together. But Horsley had to bow out through ill
health and Haskins became chairman in 1986.
At the time predators were stalking the stock market and Northern
Foods came into their sights. But Haskins saw them off by reorganising
the business and withdrawing from a misadventure in the US. Since then
it has gone from strength to strength, working closely with the
supermarkets in the development of the prepared food industry.
With its over-riding need for food safety and its highly organised
cold-chain distribution techniques, this has become a world beater.
Haskins did not shirk hard decisions then either. Rationalisation
following the purchase of Eden Vale and Express Dairies cost 1000 jobs.
''We run a competitive business in a professional way but we try not
to do it in a bloodthirsty way. We believe in good relations with our
employees, suppliers and customers. In the present case there is too
much supply to the market and it is necessary to make cuts for the
long-term health of the business and, therefore, of the great majority
employees who will not lose their jobs.''
The latest round of redundancies will be spread over two years and
Northern will try to give those affected as much notice as possible. It
will provide external job search services to help people find other
work.
It comes as something of a surprise that shareholders are not going to
share part of the burden. Their dividends are to be maintained despite
the cost of redundancies and the halving in the allocation to the
employees' profit sharing scheme. Haskins says the group can easily
afford this -- it is in a strong financial position and has to keep the
interests of shareholders in mind.
He is critical of the City of London's excesses but recognises what it
does for Britain in the international arena. As a manufacturer he is
exposed to the short-termism which has bedevilled British industry by
making it more difficult to obtain long-term finance for capital
investment, the lack of which has been the great failing of the economy.
He is convinced Britain could learn from the German model of long-term
relationships with shareholders and bankers which encourage consistently
high levels of capital investment. This is a major factor in Germany's
economic success, which not even a grossly overvalued Deutschmark can
seriously dent.
Given his beliefs, Haskins could not be anything other than supportive
of the European Union's Social Chapter which Britain opted out of, and
he does pursue its provisions to some extent within Northern. The
company is committed to equal opportunites, training and good
communications with employees. But it hasn't formed works councils, a
key part of the chapter, though he says these would not present any
problem.
He believes in employees having a stake in the business. So the
profit-sharing scheme consists of the distribution of shares.
Unfortunately, the reaction of most employees of Northern and other
companies which do the same is to turn their shares into cash as soon as
possible. This saddens him though he recognises that little can be done
about it. He also approves of share options as an incentive but only if
they are handled sensitively. The group has an option scheme for all
employees plus a separate one for directors.
As one would expect, Northern has been applying most of the
recommendations of the Cadbury Committee on Corporate Governance for
years. Executive directors' pay is decided by a three-person committee
of non-executive directors and they are certainly not generous with
Haskins himself. In 1993/94 he received #185,000, the same as in the
previous year. This is low for the chairman of a major business with
sales topping #2000m. He had a bonus, but only #14,500.
Nevertheless, he is wealthy enough to own a farm. At weekends he
unwinds by tramping across his 800 acres with his retinue of dogs. He
feeds the cattle and examines the crops, even though the farm is really
run by one of his five children. By his own admission, he is not too
good with the machinery, however, and is banned from the combine
harvester.
Haskins's life is compartmentalised -- ''some business management, a
bit of politicking, occasional writing and a bit of farming''. One
senses that at 58, when the time comes to hand over the reins, he will
be happy enough to give up the management, but definitely not the
politicking.

Save &amp; Prosper
deposit account
INVESTMENT house Save &amp; Prosper is taking advantage of the current
interest rate yield curve to launch a new term deposit account with
Robert Fleming, paying up to 8.375% gross for a five-year deposit.
The interest rate is guaranteed at the time of the deposit for the
whole term. There is a choice of one, three or five-year terms. The
minumum deposit is #10,000 with higher rates payable for deposits of
#25,000 or more.
The returns are 6.75% for a one-year deposit rising to 7.25% for
#25,000 and above, 7.75% for three years rising to 8.25%, and 8% for
five years rising to 8.375%. Interest is paid annually for the present
but quarterly and monthly payment is not ruled out in the future.
Ian Lindsey, executive director, says: ''The gap between long and
short-term rates is at its widest for several years, and investors
should take the opportunity to benefit from a high, fixed rate of
interest for up to five years with the capital security of a bank
deposit.
''The account meets the needs of people who require the comfort of
knowing their income will not fluctuate as interest rates change.''
New trust from
Stewart Ivory
EDINBURGH-based fund management group Stewart Ivory has launched a new
investment trust focusing on smaller Asian companies (excluding Japan)
by way of a placing sponsored by Brewin Dolphin Bell Lawrie.
Scottish Oriental Smaller Companies Trust is seeking to raise
#23.739m. The placing is not underwritten. The investment objective is
is to achieve long-term capital growth by investing mainly in companies
with a market capitalisation of under $500m.
Countries under initial consideration for investment are Singapore,
Hong Kong, Thailand, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, South
Korea, Sri Lanka, China and Taiwan. Ordinary shares of 25p are being
issued at 100p plus one-for-five warrants which will be exercisable at
100p in the years 1997-2007 inclusive.
Tax update by
Ernst &amp; Young
ACCOUNTANT and financial adviser Ernst &amp; Young has produced its
Tax-Saving Strategies Guide 1995. Written in a user-friendly way, it
enables the reader to identify tax-saving opportunities this year as
well as actively planning so that less tax will have to be paid in
future years.
The book covers tax considerations for both individual and business
needs whether as a self-employed professional or as an employee. It
includes all the tax changes announced in the November 1994 Budget as
well as key developments in this year's Finance Bill.
Tax-Saving Strategies Guide 1995 has been written with the huge
changes taking place in personal taxation specifically in mind.
''The burden for working out how much tax is due is moving from the
Inland Revenue on to the shoulders of the individual taxpayer -- with a
financial penalty if he or she can't cope. We hope this book will help
everyone prepare for self-assessment, and be in a position to face their
new responsibilities in 1996/7 with the confidence that they know what
is expected of them and how to deal with it,'' says Herald Personal
Finance writer Valerie Smart, who is a tax partner at Ernst &amp; Young and
one of the book's editorial panel.
Tax-Saving Strategies Guide 1995 is published by John Wiley and Sons
and costs #9.99.

And they all lived in little boxes/And they all looked just the same .
. . but unlike many 1960s system-built houses, prefabs came to be loved
by their inhabitants. Joe Donnelly investigates.
THIS was where John and Mary Birrell had their honeymoon. ''We
couldn't afford to go anywhere else. So it's more than just home to us,
that's for sure.'' More than just home, to John Birrell, is a
two-bedroom house in its own plot of land. There used to be thousands of
them, all over the country, all built to take the overcrowded and the
dispossessed and the homeless. More than just home is a Prefab.
Only a handful of them still exist, manufactured one-storey houses
that look like a hybrid between a Butlin's chalet and an upmarket Nissen
hut. A few still stand in Glasgow, a scant half-dozen or so. There are
some in Edinburgh, all of them under threat of the bulldozer. There's a
community of prefabs in Midlothian, where John and Mary Birrell have
lived contented lives for 26 years. There's even a rumour that one was
lifted on to a trailer and driven north to take a ferry to the Western
Isles where it, reputedly, still stands.
They are a rare and dying breed, if that's a fair enough phrase to use
about a tin house. It probably is, because the prefabs, built from
aluminium, asbestos, nuts, bolts, and concrete, just after the war,
became home to so many people that they became part of the culture, part
of the memory of the 50s and 60s. Even in the 90s people are prepared to
fight to save them, campaigning with as much anger and vigour as animal
rights supporters now battle.
It's clear that these little houses, stuck on cement bases and given a
few square yards of land of their own, were special. They might have
rattled in a gale and contracted with the cold in the winter, pinging
back again in the heat of a Scottish summer, but they were still magic.
Two bedrooms, a living-room and a kitchen; a bit of a hallway and
windows with steel frames. ''But it was more than that,'' says John.
''You had space and you had privacy and that was worth a whole lot.
People in the prefabs weren't crowded on top of each other, packed in
like sardines.''
He and Mary live in Sutties-Lee Drive, Newtongrange, where a few years
ago an enlightened local authority decided to clad the aluminium prefab
box and rehabilitate it. ''We came here 26 years ago, straight from our
wedding,'' John says. ''Our two daughters and our son came here as
babies and learned to walk and talk here. All the laughs and all the
tears happened here in this wee house. It's been a brilliant home and I
wouldn't shift for anything.''
That's just one man's view of his prefab castle, but it is by no means
unique. These little metal houses, borne of necessity and housing
poverty, are icons to the mid-twentieth century. They were conceived and
constructed for an emergency and an exploding population of post-war
baby boomers. The builders and designers had no conception that they
could become part of the culture, loved and lauded, architectural
landmarks of a nation's history.
They had no idea that their cheap assembly-line metal boxes would
become the focus of bitter battles to save them from demolition. Nor
would they have believed, back then in the forties and fifties, that
people would even be moved to write poetry about the humble prefab.
So what casts the spell? From the outside, looking in, it's not so
easy to comprehend. They were small and sometimes cold and draughty, yet
there are still battles to save them. It's a cultural thing. Folk who
lived in single ends, who lived up four flights in crumbling tenements,
or in overcrowded racks of grey sandstone without the luxury of an
inside toilet, they were the people who moved into the prefabs.
The new tenants found themselves with a bit of space, a piece of land
they could walk round and, even if rented, it was theirs. It was the
territorial imperative, a place all of their own, marked by all the
boundaries of a garden and a hedge or a fence. Strangely, it was that
privacy that bound the prefab communities together.
''It was always a happy scheme,'' says William Lawson, 56, one of the
last few residents left in what was once a thriving community in
Hangingshaw, near Hampden Park in the South Side of Glasgow. ''The
neighbours respected each other. You never had any trouble. There was a
real feeling of community. I lived in my prefab for 21 years and I
bought it when I got the chance. My wife Catherine and myself came from
a tenement in Govanhill and this place was a real breath of fresh air.
''My son Tony was just five then. He loved having a garden to play in
and I loved having one to work in and grow things. The house was just
the right size. Everybody loved having their own house and garden. Now
there's just a handful left here. They've knocked the guts out of the
place, out of what was once the best scheme in Glasgow. It really was a
sin.''
William's battle is still going on. ''It's like a bomb-site here. Most
of the prefabs have gone and now they want to demolish the last
half-dozen out of 52. We put up a great fight to save the others, but we
lost. They have offered us #30,000, but that's nowhere near enough to
buy somewhere like this anywhere else. It's nowhere near enough . . .
after all we've spent on putting in double glazing and central
heating.''
Despondently he adds: ''The council will get us out, though. I believe
that within four months this scheme will be finally and completely
cleared. This piece of ground will just end up as part of the car-park
for Hampden, mark my words.''
In Edinburgh, the battle is hotter. In Craigour Avenue, 146 prefabs
have been facing demolition. ''Over my dead body,'' says Sylvia Blyth.
''I've lived here for 12 years, but I've friends who have stayed in this
scheme for nearly 50. These houses were built in 1947 and the community
has grown up in that half century.
''Instead of knocking down the prefabs, they should preserve them. I
believe they should be made listed-buildings because they are an
important part of our history. They've been listed and protected in
other parts of Britain, but here, some councils and councillors seem
either short-sighted or downright blind.''
The pensioners of Craigour -- most of the folk living in the scheme
are senior citizens -- fighting to save the last of Edinburgh's prefabs
have won a stay of execution, though for how long, no-one is certain.
They've been battling for years to save the homes in the Moredun area of
the city. The district council claims the houses are structurally
unsound and too expensive to upgrade.
Sylvia and her neighbours have managed to persuade the housing
committee to look for an alternative solution. Whether they will find
one that is acceptably cheap is another matter. ''We've been told the
council will not demolish our homes, for now, so we've won a stay of
execution. We've won a victory, particularly because previously there
was no evidence that the council cared about the feelings of the people
living in the prefabs.
''But we have a community here, a strong and close-knit community.
Many of the residents are elderly and the worry and the upset in the
last few years has been devastating to them. I believe the strain has
led to a number of funerals that might not have taken place without all
this worry. Here, the prefabs are ideally suited to elderly folk and the
disabled who need peace and quiet and privacy.''
Edinburgh District Council says it will take no action for the moment,
although it insists that total refurbishment is ''unviable''. It is
prepared to consider options including minor repairs. Failing that, a
way of life will disappear forever, as it has in so many other cities.
Yet prefabs are still loved and lived in elsewhere. In Birmingham, 17
of them are part of a plan to have them listed as buildings of
historical and architectural importance -- as they have been described
by their aficionados in Scotland -- alongside churches and mansion
houses and castles. Almost 20 years ago, Birmingham announced a
three-year demolition programme. Local historians united with residents
to force a reprieve.
One resident said: ''The listed-building status doesn't change
anything. But it does make you feel that you're living somewhere a bit
special. Of course we've known that all along.''
In Midlothian, John Birrell would agree with that. The houses at
Sutties-Lee in Newtongrange were upgraded at a cost of up to #17,000
each, the aluminium panels covered with a skin of brick, a new roof
built and modern windows fitted.
''We've had more than a quarter of a century of happiness here and
nothing would make me give it up. The house was upgraded and modernised,
but inside, it's still got the same old familiar walls. I've been here
since I was married and I hope I'll be here the rest of my life.
Prefabs? They're magic, they really are.''
ODE TO A PREFAB
Farewell old friend, 'tis sad to know
Your time has come at last,
Our march of progress signifies
The prefabs' days are past.
However much its critics let
Their verbal fancies roam,
They can't deny the prefab was,
For many, home sweet home.
Although, alas, it must depart,
In changing times like these,
Nothing can demolish
The prefabs' memories.
J M Robertson, Circa 1963
The fab facts
* THE prefabs were designed as purely temporary structures, built for
a few hundred pounds, the product of the Temporary Housing Act, 1944.
The Act empowered the Government to spend #150m, then a truly enormous
sum of money, on providing emergency accommodation to replace homes
destroyed in the war.
Five prototypes of the first prefabricated homes were unveiled at the
Tate Gallery in May 1944, making them ipso facto works of art, icons of
the mid century.
Most of the homes were allocated to families of demobilised servicemen
and those dispossessed in the bombing. The construction programme --
each prefab came in a kit form and used more than 2000 components -- was
an early job-creation programme in both manufacturing and construction.
It was also a cultural and self-sufficiency programme. Each house had a
plot of land large enough to grow vegetables in the days of rationing.
Within five years, more than 150,000 new houses were constructed
throughout the country, most of them a cross between an army camp and a
holiday hut. They were supposed to last only 10 years. Many of them were
manufactured by Blackburn, a Dumbarton-based aircraft manufacturer that
re-tooled at the end of the war. Instead of making fighters and bombers,
it made homes for the air-crew -- and the soldiers and sailors -- to
come home to when the fighting ended. It was making homes fit for
returning heroes.
Most of the prefabs were indeed temporary, torn down and replaced by
brick and concrete council houses, but even in those early days such
demolitions were fought by the tenants who had grown fond of having
their own detached home. They had come to love the prefab.
Some councils listened to tenants and belatedly began to modernise and
uprgade. Initially improvements included rewiring and cavity-wall
insulation and later encompassed window replacement and exterior
cladding. Asbestos roofs were replaced with lightweight panels. Some
prefabs gained new kitchens and bathrooms, even central heating.
All of this was a far cry from the late forties when prefabs had a
cast-iron cooker, a boiler, and a mangle. To the young mothers of the
post-war era, after years of privation and hardship, a cooker and a
boiler, and a mangle were three of the ingredients of paradise.

* I am a relatively inexperienced investor, but through inheritance I
have built up a portfolio of investment trusts, unit trusts and shares.
The current value is about #20,000. For the first time I am having to
pay tax on the dividends. I am a higher rate taxpayer.
To reduce the tax payment would it be possible for me to convert my
portfolio or parts of it into PEPs, and if so, would it be worth the
trouble? The unit trusts are mainly M&amp;G and Murray Johnstone; the
investment trusts are Alliance and Foreign &amp; Colonial, and the shares
are BAA, BT and Marks &amp; Spencer.
* PEPs provide a shelter from income tax on dividends and capital
gains tax. Management charges have to be deducted from an individual's
potential benefits in assessing their suitability to his circumstances.
As a 40% taxpayer there is a clear advantage to you in holding
investments through PEPs. At this stage it is unlikely you would benefit
from the freedom from capital gains tax liability, since you would not
be liable to any tax because of your annual exemption limit.
You say you are a relatively inexperienced investor, but it would
appear you have a potentially rewarding portfolio. Unfortunately, you
cannot just transfer your existing investments into PEPs. Basically, the
shares have to be sold and bought back again by the PEP managers. The
management companies for your unit and investment trusts all operate
PEPs and corporate PEPs are available for your equities.
In each tax year (to April 5) you are entitled to put up to #6000 into
a general and up to #3000 into a single company PEP, and you can repeat
the process as soon as the new tax year starts. If you are married your
partner has the same entitlements. But note that each individual can
have only one general and one single company PEP a year.
Your best course is probably to contact the unit and investment trust
managers for details of their PEPs and your company registrars for
details of their corporate PEPs.
You should be able to work out for yourself how best to shelter your
investments from tax through PEPs. The Alliance Trust PEP restricts
investment in trust shares to #1500 but offers self-select facilities
for a wide range of blue chips both as a top up in its general PEP and
as single company PEPs. Charges are low.
* I have about #40,000 in Edinburgh Unit Trust Managers' Pacific fund.
This represents about one-third of my total investments. I want to take
profits within the capital gains tax allowance and reinvest it in the
same fund.
Would any tax complications arise from this? Would I be keeping too
many eggs in one basket and, if so, would this still be the case if I
invested in another fund run by the same managers? I am a basic rate
taxpayer.
* In the tax year which ends on April 5 you have a capital gains tax
exemption allowance of #5800 and this rises to #6000 in 1995/6. You can
index the cost of purchasing your investments for inflation and offset
your gains against any capital losses you may have.
So long as you get the arithmetic right, there should be no
complications from taking profits on your unit trust investment. If
necessary you can carry out the transactions over more than one tax
year. Any gains in excess of your allowance would be charged at your
highest tax rate.
The transaction you have in mind is known as bed and breakfasting,
where an asset is sold one day and bought back the next.
But we would strongly advise you to reduce your holding. Having
one-third of your capital tied up in one investment goes far beyond the
bounds of prudence. Reinvesting some of the money in another fund run by
the same managers would be better. However, your best course would be to
pick a fund or funds with other managers to reduce the risk.
We suspect you may need independent advice on achieving a proper
balance within your portfolio. This could be obtained from financial
advisers specialising in unit trusts or through a stockbroker. Your
adviser would assist with the capital gains tax calculations which can
be complex.
* Throughout the tax years 1989/90 to 1993/94 and for April and May
this tax year I was in non-pensionable employment. As a result I have
#94,709 in gross earnings from which I calculate that, at 20%, I have a
potential pension fund of #18,941 to invest in a personal pension scheme
using the carry-back principles.
As I am now in pensionable employment and have signed up for my
employer's non-contributory scheme, what is the best way forward for my
pension planning? I can afford to take the maximum allowable under a
free-standing AVC. I don't want to use the employer's AVC.
Should I take out such a plan and use it to mop up my unused
allowances from 1989/90? Or should I take out a separate personal
pension plan for my unused allowances through a single premium payment
and then take out a separate FAVC to boost current pension
contributions? Is there an advantage to me as a 40% taxpayer to go down
the PEPs route for either my unused allowances and/or my ''spare
capacity'' in current pension payment allowances?
* You can only make use of the carry back and carry forward procedure
within a personal pension policy applying to the years you were not in
pensionable employment. A free-standing AVC for making extra pension
contributions could only be used for the current tax year.
It would be sensible to invest as much as you can in a single premium
personal pension policy for the prior years, particularly as a quarter
of the fund can be taken as cash on retirement, when this degree of
flexibility is useful.
The question for this and subsequent years is whether you have a
free-standing AVC, obtaining tax relief on the premiums, or have a PEP,
which will generate tax-free income when required. As you are a 40%
taxpayer it is better to go down the FAVC route, unless you prefer not
to put too much of your savings into an inflexible pension policy, where
the capital cannot be touched until retirement when it has to be used to
buy income.
Savings advice
for student
* I am a 25-year-old student (non-taxpayer) in my first year at
university on a four-year course. I live in rented accommodation and
receive a full grant. I have no outstanding debts or policies and
currently have #17,000 in an ordinary savings account in a building
society. I would like the money put away for four or five years as I
don't need any of it for my education. I would like your advice on my
best course of action.
* This is a useful sum of my money to have at your disposal. If you
are sure that you do not require it for four or five years we would
suggest you invest the bulk of it in four or five investment trusts,
with the objective of achieving capital growth.
Your time span seems long enough to give such investments a reasonable
period to fructify. Most world stock markets are well below peak levels
attained early last year, suggesting that in the medium term there are
reasonable prospects of recovery.
You could pick from Dundee's Alliance Trust, Baillie Gifford's
Scottish Mortgage and Martin Currie's Scottish Eastern, both
Edinburgh-based, Murray (Johnstone) International in Glasgow, and
Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust in London.
The management companies operate low-cost share purchase schemes for
all these trusts, but if you feel that you need detailed advice on your
purchases you can buy investment trust shares through a stockbroker.
Investment trusts are ideal vehicles for the small investor since each
invests its funds in a spread of shares at home and abroad.
However, since no-one can predict the future, we would urge you to
retain a few thousand pounds in a high income savings account with a
bank or building society in case you need it.
We checked with the Scottish Education Department to see if your grant
could be affected by your savings. We were told that savings have no
bearing on a grant award, but any income from savings (such as interest
or dividends) above #800 per annum would be taken into account.
If you retained all your money in a bank or building society, the
interest could easily exceed #800. Dividends from the investment trusts
listed above are relatively modest except in the case of Murray
International.
Once you have completed your course at university you may wish to
realise some or all of your investments to use the cash for house
purchase and associated expenses.

correspondence can be entered into.
Way to change terms of will
* I know it is possible to change the terms of a will within a time
limit after death and I have been receiving conflicting advice on how to
reduce inheritance tax. My circumstances are that I am the only
beneficiary of my mother's will. She died recently leaving an estate in
excess of #200,000.
I would now like to donate some of the funds to charity and make gifts
to other relations before inheritance tax is charged. Can you tell me if
it is possible to use the #3000 annual exemptions or the small gift
exemptions of #250, neither of which were used during my mother's
lifetime?
* As your mother died within the last two years it is possible to vary
the terms of her will by the use of a Deed of Variation. This must be in
writing, must be made within two years of the date of your mother's
death, and as you are the sole beneficiary it need only be signed by
yourself.
You should ask your solicitor to draft the terms of the variation to
ensure that it achieves the result you want and is in a form which the
Capital Taxes Office accepts as meeting the terms of the inheritance tax
legislation. It is necessary to make and lodge with the Inland Revenue a
formal election within six months of the execution of the deed, which
will have the effect of making your mother's estate liable to
inheritance tax as though she had left her assets as set out in the
deed.
With regard to the terms of the variation, it is too late to make use
of the annual or small gift exemptions, as these only apply during the
person's lifetime. Legacies to other members of your family will still
be treated as chargeable transfers from the estate and will, therefore,
not reduce the inheritance liability, but gifts to charity will reduce
the amount of the estate liable to tax.
* Under the terms of our divorce agreement both my wife and I have
custody of our 10-year-old son for part of each year. Does this
arrangement exclude us from claiming the extra tax allowance which is
available to single parents?
* The tax allowance to which you refer is the additional personal
allowance in respect of children, and is available to single parents or
to a man whose wife is totally incapacitated.
The relief is in respect of children under 16 or over that age but
still in full-time education, who are resident with the parent for all
or part of the year. The fact that your son lives with his mother for
part of the year does not disqualify either of you from claiming the
allowance.
If both you and your wife make a claim, the allowance will be
apportioned between you, either in amounts which you can agree or,
failing that, in proportion to the length of time your son stays with
each of you during the year.
* I have often read about not retaining National Savings Certificates
too long. Could you please advise on the following situation.
My father is 83 and a widower. He has no income other than his state
pension and lives alone. He has held second issue index-linked
certificates since April 1982 and they constitute his only savings. He
is apparently keeping them for funeral expenses in spite of all my pleas
to cash them and spend the money.
Is there a better way of earning interest or should he leave them as
they are? I get the feeling that they are now earning very little and he
should transfer to some other means, but unless he sees advice from your
good selves he won't do anything.
* These certificates now pay nothing on top of indexation so the money
should definitely be moved elsewhere. The current eighth issue of
index-linked certificates yield 3% on top of indexation. However,
inflation is likely to remain subdued in coming years so your father
would be better off investing in the Pensioners' Bond which returns 7.5%
gross.

TINY Rowland's last stand against Dieter Bock ended with an honourable
defeat at yesterday's annual meeting where Mr Rowland's traditional army
of small shareholder supporters almost filled the 1100-seat Barbican
Theatre in London.
He only just missed receiving enough votes on a show of hands to
achieve his hope of continuing to have a say in the running of the
company he created.
But he had the consolation of knowing that the spirit of the meeting
was with him, as shareholder after shareholder said that without his
genius Lonrho would be nowhere and urged that his association with the
group was maintained.
The resolution to create the post of president, which Mr Rowland was
to have held, had to have a 75% majority. The show of hands came to
73.5% in favour of the resolution, which therefore failed.
There were calls for a recount in view of the narrowness of the
defeat, but Lonrho's chairman of four months, Sir John Leahy, said it
was pointless.
In fact, the whole vote was pointless, except to show Mr Rowland how
popular he remained, because Sir John had in his pocket proxies from the
big institutions representing more than half the votes.
Halfway through the meeting came the moment everyone had been waiting
for. Mr Rowland himself rose to address his loyal shareholders while his
former fellow directors looked on impassively. This was the first time
anyone could remember that he had spoken directly to shareholders.
He said that the vote did not matter to him; the only thing that
counted was the future of Lonrho. He pointed out that he had appointed
all the present board, including the chairman, with the exception of two
non-executives, Stephen Walls and Peter Harper.
After speaking a few sentences, Mr Rowland, who looked his 77 years,
handed over to a spokesman, John Beveridge. He said that when Mr Bock
was appointed it had been expected he would bring business to the group,
whereas Mr Rowland considered he had brought none. Mr Rowland had not
received answers to questions he had raised about Mr Bock's financial
position and his other business interests.
A statement signed by Mr Rowland had earlier been handed out to
shareholders going into the meeting. In this he criticised Mr Bock for
not finding new investment opportunities.
At the start of the meeting Mr Bock had addressed shareholders, saying
that 1995 should be an ''even better'' year for Lonrho.
''The income from our hotels is improving, the ouput of our mines is
increasing and our agricultural interests and specifically the sugar
operations are performing strongly,'' he said.
Acquisitions are planned in hotels, and opportunities will be
developed in the other activities. Mr Bock said the company had no
intention of divesting the African businesses which were, of course, Mr
Rowland's pride and joy.
Questions and comments from the floor were generally in favour of Mr
Rowland. One shareholder said that if the post of president was an
honorary one, then why should Mr Rowland not occupy it.
Sir John replied that it was pretty clear that Mr Rowland would not
have accepted an honorary post and that his exact role had been left for
later consideration.
Another asked why the two years since Mr Bock's appointment had not
been enough to judge Mr Rowland's suitability for the post of president.
There were several comments to the effect that no disagreement was
irreconcilable. Sir John replied that many attempts at reconciliation
had been made and all had failed.
On the other tack an elderly shareholder said that they could not have
a president who ran down the chief executive.
Sir John conducted the meeting with the diplomacy one would expect of
a former Foreign Office mandarin, judging the mood correctly when he
brought questions and comments to a close in order to conduct the vote.
We have not yet heard the last from Mr Rowland, as he has a writ
outstanding alleging unfair dismissal from Lonrho, but the last vestiges
of influence he had on the group's affairs have now ended.

Kenneth Wright looks at the new releases
AMERICA'S attitude towards the Noble Savage always reminds Couch
Potato more than somewhat of the Walrus's attitude to oysters. You will
of course remember how, in Lewis Carroll's poem in Alice, the Walrus and
the Carpenter escort a group of innocent little bivalves on a seaside
outing from which no oyster returns. ''Now, oysters!'', said the
Carpenter/ ''We've had a pleasant run/ Shall we be getting home
again?''/ But answer came there none/ Which wasn't odd, because, you
know/ They'd eaten every one.
The Carpenter's line on the whole affair was at least more honest than
the Walrus's. While the former called for more bread and butter to help
the oysters down (The Carpenter said nothing but/ ''Pass us another
slice/ I wish you were not quite so deaf/ I've had to ask you twice''),
the Walrus was shedding crocodile tears over the misfortunes of his
lunch. ''I weep for you'', the Walrus said/ ''I deeply sympathise''/ As
he plied his pocket handkerchief/ Around his streaming eyes/ While
choosing from among the crowd/ Four of the largest size . . .
Now, doesn't that remind you of what happened to, for example, the
Native Americans? First you massacre the lot, then you make films like
Dances With Wolves about what jolly decent chaps they were before they
got massacred. Well, Kevin Costner, star and director of that film
(retitled by the divine Pauline Kael as Plays With Camera), has since
been pursuing his interest in noble savages with Rapa Nui (rental, cert
12), an adventure allegory about another conveniently extinct people,
whose winsome piety makes anthropologist Margaret Mead look like Simon
Legree.
Costner is credited only as producer on this one, but you can safely
assume that it's his project and that it got the green light in the
Robin Hood/JFK/Wolves days when Kevin Costner was a bankable name. It's
the story of how the two tribes of Rapa Nui (known these days as Easter
Island) came to grief through class conflict based on the differing
sizes of their ears. This is embodied in the perilous annual
rites-of-passage competition among the young men to collect a bird's egg
from a neighbouring island and bring it back unbroken, and this year
it's a grudge match between love rivals Jason Scott Lee (Long Ear) and
Esai Morales (Short Ear).
Once it gets going, the thrillingly photographed competition and the
bloody rivalries it stirs up among the tribesfolks are very watchable in
a Nanook of the North sort of way, but first you have to get through a
long hour of serpent-in-Eden scene-setting burdened with cod-authentic
dialogue unequalled since Theda Bara cried Harness my zebras, gift of
the Nubian king!
Much more anthropologically interesting and almost as funny is Mike
Newell's Brit hit Four Weddings And A Funeral, now available to buy at
#12.99 (cert 15, and Couch Potato can't think why: PG at worst, surely).
Having enjoyed it immensely in the cinema and then jumped up and down on
its face on its first video release, Couch Potato's second-second
thoughts on this slick and speedy comedy of English upper-class mating
rituals are now more moderate.
Andie McDowell's smug, preppy characterisation of the femme lead
(''wood masquerading as porcelain'', as Couch Potato wishes he'd said
first) is still deeply unsympathetic. At the big wedding scene towards
the end you want to grab prospective groom Hugh Grant and say Don't even
look at that bitch in the fifth row! Yet the subplots, the details, and
the mostly irrelevant jokes have just about enough twinkle and heart to
keep one distracted from the overly cute and oddly heartless yuppie-love
central storyline.
The best things in the film are Simon Callow's screaming-queen act,
John Hannah's deep-toned and dignified performance as his working-class
Scottish boyfriend, and the funeral that arises out of that
relationship. What a good film this could have been (Couch Potato
thinks) if Callow and Hannah's warm and truly serious relationship had
been at the centre -- contrasted against all the frivolous heterosexual
houghmagandie going on all around them -- rather than being just a plot
device designed to demonstrate how hip, tolerant, and groovy all the
other characters are.
But then the film would have been a gay tragedy rather than a straight
comedy, and -- not sharing Philadelphia's advantage of having Tom Hanks
in the lead -- it would have died like a dog at the box-office. Hey . .
. that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise.

Laying aside mass-produced anonymity, Lesley Duncan goes off in search
of a practical yet attractive umbrella and finds we don't have to put up
with a washout in the design stakes.
MOST of us have done a lot of scowling in the rain recently. That
staple prop of North British life, the umbrella, is never far from our
hands, even if wheeched inside-out by gusting winds.
There are different philosophies of umbrellas. The businessman's black
gamp is deliberately anonymous. The typical golf umbrella, with its
segments of bright colour, seems to assert the owner's personality, defy
the elements to do their worst. I subscribe to the positive school of
brollies, though the golfing variety -- particularly those with steel
spikes for stabbing into fairways -- are too heavy, if not potentially
dangerous, for use in busy city streets.
So is it possible to find safe but sturdy umbrellas with a touch of
individuality? I had the ideal one once; have its remains still, though
its covering is punctured in places and its spokes need fixed.
My paragon of an umbrella came from the St Andrews Woollen Mill in
Fife. It shows a bucolic scene of sheep grazing under an azure sky
dotted with fluffy white clouds. It's big, almost of golf-umbrella
dimensions, but has an elegant curved wooden handle and no lethal point.
It could have prodded toffs in the royal enclosure at Ascot. I used it
shamelessly as a fashion accessory until it fell apart.
And that's another grouse. In this throwaway society, umbrella
repairing seems to be an almost lost art. Not one repairer is listed in
Glasgow's Yellow Pages. However -- happy find -- Nimbus Umbrellas, the
only city manufacturer listed, will do repairs. Owner Roderick Scott
explains that the firm stopped manufacturing quality ladies' umbrellas
in the 1970s because of cheap competition from Asia. Now they mostly
make promotional golf-style brollies.
Miniature, telescopic umbrellas are increasingly popular these days.
They're certainly convenient for stuffing into bags or briefcases but
are inherently less robust, because of size and extra joints, than their
full-size counterparts. And have you ever struggled with, or been poked
in the eye by, an unco-operative telescopic specimen that suddenly
twangs into life? Unnerving.
Umbrellas with straps (preferably leather) allow you to swing them
over your back when it's dry, leaving hands free. They're not all that
easy to find. A new trend is to have the brolly encased in a cover which
itself has a strap. All right in theory. But I've had an umbrella fall
out of its protective cradle while I walked on oblivious to my loss.
Anyway, what are you supposed to do with the discarded casing and strap
when you're actually using the umbrella? Black marks for
un-thought-through design here.
My hunt for strong, functional, but elegant gamps was not unrewarding.
Liberty's have a selection in characteristic floral prints in treated
cotton. The walking variety have curved wooden handles. The small
folding ones come with matching pouch. They're pricey but classy at
#39.95 and #35 respectively. The National Trust for Scotland shop has
golf-sized brollies with trust motifs on their handsome blue and green
coverings. Their handles have a good grip. They cost #19.95.
As for my pastoral brolly, could I find its like again? A tip-off led
to the Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, where the cloud-capped beauty
(it's black on the outside) is on sale at #55. Monet and Renoir scenes
offer Impressionist cheer at #22.50.
Yes, there's still an art in umbrellas. In Helensburgh, Pamela Randal
hand-paints steel-framed, silk-covered umbrellas of German provenance.
With their stylised flower motifs (Mackintosh rose, fuchsias and
butterflies, waterlilies, irises) in fresh pinks and blues and greens,
they could grace the stage in Madame Butterfly but are also functional.
Randal first draws her design with a wash-off pen, then, if she is
satisfied with that, uses an outliner which prevents her Deka silk paint
from running. This thin paint moves beautifully over silk surfaces. It
is set by heat when the fabric is ironed on the reverse side. Then it is
treated with waterproofing spray of the kind used for reproofing camping
and hiking gear. Seams are sprayed twice.
The resultant brollies may look like parasols (they would be ideal
shelters for bridal parties in summer downpours) but are as practical as
any businessman's gloomy prop. With their beech handles and detachable
shoulder straps, they cost #30 to #40. A tempting buy -- and they can be
teamed with matching silk scarves.
Nimbus Umbrellas, 93 Candleriggs, Glasgow (041 552 2849).
Pamela Randal works from home, 01436 675969, and shows her umbrellas
at craft fairs.

WHEN he asked ''Right, which will it be first, heroes or villains?'' I
thought I had misheard -- this was a telephone interview. I said we
should start with the hero. It turned out that I had not misheard and
John Sessions, a man of many parts, was under the impression I had
called him in his dressing room at the Criterion Theatre in Piccadilly
to ask for his chosen hero and villain. The discovery that this was not
the case led to some pretty hasty second thoughts, although these
appeared to come fairly easily to a man who is a master of
improvisation.
Sessions is currently starring in My Night With Reg, one of the
funniest and most moving plays in the West End. It deals with love,
death, and social disaster, and is that rarity, a story about a group of
homosexual men who have all slept with the same man, yet it is not aimed
at a closet audience. It may not be a family play, but it is a
mainstream-audience play.
Sessions comes from Largs. Hardly anybody in Scotland can be unaware
of the fact, but it is important to restate it since Sessions's hero is
also from Largs. ''It is my uncle, Bill Clark, who passed on six years
ago,'' he said. ''He used to live in Largs and was managing director of
a dye works in Kilbirnie. He was one of those people with genuine
panache, like James Stewart. He walked with style, he was very popular,
friendly, kind and decent. He really was my hero as a child -- he was
actually my father's brother-in-law.
''Bill was known to all and sundry in Largs. There was no snobbery
about him at all. He was as easy chatting with the guys on the boats as
he was with well-heeled West Coast businessmen, of which he was one. He
would go down and have a drink at the Clachan by the pier. Maybe he was
not a pillar of the community, but he was well-known, loved and
respected and many people had good reason to be grateful to him. He was
a very kind and considerate uncle, not just a case of slipping you the
odd fiver.''
Then Sessions said if that was enough of that, what about doing his
villain? ''Villain, you are supposed to be talking about heroes and
heroines,'' I said. ''Oh, my God,'' he said. ''Right, some quick
thinking is needed. It will have to be one of those old American film
stars. I would say someone like Bette Davis who took on the studios,
would not take any shit, and was probably the best actress ever to come
out of Hollywood. I really like those kind of ballsy women. I never met
her and this is based purely on what I think of her performances. She
could walk up and down a room smoking a cigarette and say her lines
better than anybody. She was not a looker but she got by.
''Katherine Hepburn, when she was young, was pretty good-looking, but
Bette had a low forehead, a highbeaked nose, and a wee face. She got by
on pure talent in films like Now Voyager, Little Foxes, Jezebel, and
Dark Victory. I would love to have met her. I have met a couple of those
old stars -- Maureen O'Hara and Lauren Bacall -- but I am sure Bette
would not have been a disappointment. You could have had a good dram
with her as well. I also think she would have got on with my uncle.''
Hero and heroine dealt with, who would his villain have been if he had
been allowed to choose one? ''Rupert Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch, and Rupert
Murdoch,'' he said, launching into an eloquent attack on the Dirty
Digger which would have had the lawyers turning pale if repeated. ''The
day he dies I am going to open a very expensive bottle of champagne.''
As for the play, he said the nice thing was that the audiences were a
good mix of folk, and only once had Mr and Mrs Bexhill-on-Sea been
outraged. I think I was there that night. The couple in the seats behind
me walked out halfway through. Everyone else stayed to applaud
rapturously.

CONSTRUCTION group John Mowlem has definitely turned the corner,
emerging last year with pre-tax profits of #4.8m compared with the 1993
provision-afflicted loss of #124m. It is its first time in the black
since 1990.
That reflects well on the management but leaves open the question of
where Mowlem goes from here to provide substantial earnings growth.
The contracting side benefited from hefty rationalisation and also a
slight improvement in turnover to #1110m for an operating margin of 3.9%
before #3.5m of charges.
Chairman Sir Philip Beck said conditions had not been made any easier
by the Government's retreat from public expenditure under cover of the
Private Finance Initiative.
The company is pushing ahead with what are now private sector projects
and is bidding for two more design-and-build prison tenders in addition
to the already occupied Blakenhurst.
Mowlem has had several approaches to buy at least a portion of its 90%
stake in the London City Airport but they have been turned down.
Passenger numbers are now running at around 500,000 a year and losses
were reduced from #4.8m to #2.9m. That was after #3.1m of bad debts
because of a couple of small airlines failing and start-up discounts for
newcomers such as Lufthansa. This was partially offset by a group
property profit of #1m.
SGB Hire saw a 6% increase in rates during the year which, with
cost-cutting, took some #30m of expense out of the group and swung it
from losses of #18m into a #12m surplus. That was helped by much more
efficient use of stock but one concern is higher prices for new kit
because of escalating steel prices.
With John Mowlem Homes sales' of #31m and last year's emergency rights
issue, which raised #63m at 100p, Mowlem is now well capitalised with
net cash of #41m.
The 2p a share dividend, as promised, will make little impact upon
that. There are further gains to come from the re-focusing of the group
and profits this year could hit about #12m to leave the shares at 83p
trading at 14 times possible earnings which seems high enough, unless
there is corporate activity with Mowlem probably at the receiving end,
with a 3% yield.

When Tony Calder and Andrew Oldham stopped talking way back in the
sixties the impact on their record label was immediate and disastrous.
Now they're talking again. And they have a great deal to say for
themselves, discovers David Belcher, and, suprisingly enough, a lot of
it seems to be about Abba.
FITTINGLY, we convene in a cramped attic in a converted coach-house
located down a cobbled mews in the heart of London's Belgravia, the
pulsing heart of the swinging sixties. It is an apposite spot because I
am here to meet two of that era's prime backroom movers and groovers,
and the conversational mood is non-stop, now-a-go-go, stay on the scene
like a sewing-machine . . .
There are gold discs on the attic wall, next to a plaque stating that
Art creates the Business, Business does not create the Art.
Secretary-birds ebb and flow up the narrow stairway; the telly's on in
the corner; the phone never stops . . . and bullet-headed, Buddha-shaped
barrow-boy Tony Calder is absently barking scabrous stories at me from
behind his desk, in between answering phone-callers via a headset
looping 'twixt his ears and mouth.
Tall tales from gruff Tony's 30 years in the chart-life, stories which
begin: ''The Bay City Rollers? I saw them play live in Edinburgh early
on, and they were atrocious . . . but there were police outside holding
back lines of screaming kids and Tam Paton was running my kind of a
scam, so I thought I'd grab a stake in some of that.'' Or there's the
story which begins: ''So Brian Epstein turns to me, a country boy fresh
from the sticks, and he says: 'This man's out of order!'
''All because I was making up these wonderful stories for the papers
about Wayne Fontana . . . not that there was any harm in them, not like
the stories that get made up for the papers these days.''
Regrets? Tony Calder has very few. Certainly not about the geezer
whose ankles he once gripped whilst dangling the rest of the geezer out
of a fifth-storey window. ''I can't remember who the geezer was
anymore.'' Tony was in there, you see, at the start of the great British
beat boom that rocked the world in the sixties. In there with his finger
on the popular pulse and his fists tightly locked round opportunity's
throat.
Beatles' manager Epstein eventually took rather a shine to the young
Calder -- ''He chased me round the table more than once, actually'' --
and appointed him publicist to his burgeoning Merseybeat empire: the
Beatles, Wayne Fontana, Freddie and the Dreamers, Gerry and the
Pacemakers.
Tony had begun in the music business as a wee laddie, a fan. ''Decca
paid me for submitting reports to their Teen and Twenty Disc Club on
Radio Luxembourg. It got me out of doing a paper round, and more
importantly it got me the latest test-pressings.''
Shortly afterwards, Tony became a young recordbiz Herbert full-time,
round the clock. ''Decca by day, as a sales and marketing trainee, and
Mecca by night . . . Jimmy Savile taught me how to DJ at the first
dances that didn't use live bands, at what were then called
off-the-record sessions in Mecca Ballrooms up and down the country.''
Then Tony met the legendary London ace-face with whom he formed the
nearly-as-legendary Immediate record label, British pop's first
successful independent . . . the star-making Svengali memorably
described as a ''gangsterish nocturnal enigma'' . . . the
entrepreneurial sixties-zeitgeist-kinda-guy who was often lauded in
contemporary reports as the sixth Rolling Stone . . . the man who, that
very afternoon in London, had been exiting the converted Belgravia mews
coach-house as I was entering it . . . former Rolling Stones' manager
Andrew Oldham.
''We got on until 1969, me and Andrew, but then he had his problems
and was away in France, and I had mine, with ulcers and wanting to go
off and live in Antigua,'' Tony is saying, looking back to the one time
in his joint-career with Andrew ''Loog'' Oldham -- Immediate's fiscal
eclipse -- when acting like grown-ups might have been useful. ''We
didn't speak to each other when we should have, when it would have been
more sensible to keep the show on the road. When we might have merged
with other, bigger labels.
''But instead the Immediate catalogue got sold off, and it got
prostituted and badly-handled . . . and the acts got no royalties when
they should have done -- and every time I say this I get threatened with
having my legs broken, but why should I get the blame when I never got
any of the money, and Andrew never got any of the money?
''That'll be our next project, me and Andrew . . .''
Next project? Apart from running a new, resurrected Immediate label?
Old motto: Happy To Be A Part Of The Industry Of Human Happiness? New
motto: Happy To Be Apart From The General Malaise?
''Yeah . . . the next project is The Management Tell Everything. Did
you rip your bands off? Yes . . . but not as much as accountants and
lawyers do with all their pension plans and flow-charts. It's better for
a band to be with their manager when a bit of their money goes missing .
. . you can give it back to them if you get found out. OK, lads, you
want your $5m, the money's in my briefcase under the desk.''
Whoa, hang on. Forget the next project, and let's deal with the
current project. Messrs Calder and Oldham have just written a two-fisted
biography of Abba in which they hail the Swedish foursome as the
twentieth-century's supreme songwriters. Additionally, they applaud
Abba's lack of hipness; slag Bob Dylan and the bulk of the music of the
sixties for being profoundly meaningless, and accuse their most famous
ex-client, Mick Jagger, of ''craven narcissism''.
Apart from the last bit, this is somewhat surprising -- but not as
surprising as Andrew Oldham's continuing absence from our interview.
Where is he? What's he doing? Setting up some dodgy management
connections? Having a few geezers hung off tall buildings by their
ankles?
Andrew returns, all leather and a reddish goatee. He has been on the
phone. Laying into a teacher. At his son's school. In Bogota. Colombia.
''I've been living there since . . . 1974, 1975? For 20 years English
has been my second language. I'm not often back here . . . have I been
back here this year, Tony?''
As Tony shakes his head, you realise that Andrew's wheezy, slurring,
jet-lagged tones are strangely familiar. You realise that Andrew Oldham
speaks with Keith Richard's vague and deathless languor. Or vice versa.
Sentences winding down into nothing. A voice that is liquid; laid-back;
gravelly; halting; rheumy; kippered; aged for centuries in the
high-octane malt liquor of rock'n'roll.
So in the light of this . . . in the light of Andrew Oldham's own
colourful and authentic rock'n'roll history, there can only be one
question with which to begin: Andrew Oldham, formerly known as Andrew
''Loog'' Oldham in a percipient act of homage to the brutal yob-speak
created by Anthony ''Droog'' Burgess in his novel Clockwork Orange . . .
how come Abba aren't writing a book about you?
You're much more interesting than they are. All they ever did was
dress badly, trot out a few cretinous tunes, and quaintly mispronounce
the English language.
Andrew Oldham laughs a swampy and primordial-sounding laugh, much
tickled.
''It's not to do with interesting,'' he says, stalking around the
restrictive confines of Tony's office in a curiously-folded-at-the-waist
and preoccupied fashion., his eyes desperately scanning the horizon,
with one hand holding a cigarette. ''It's about the amount of pleasure
that Abba have given people. The songs, the sound . . . there's an aura
that affects people.
''Folk don't need to know what Abba's words mean. You just have to
feel comfortable with the phrases they use. It's like . . . there's
people . . . all over South America . . . my wife's Colombian and she
sings: 'I can't get no satisfaction' and she doesn't know . . . like,
what it means, but it . . . feels right.
''Abba,'' Andrew says, his sentences having become more disconnected.
''Abba . . . have the English language . . . down to . . . a mundane . .
. level. They have mastered . . . the use of. . . no words.''
Abba made no preposterous claims. That's another reason why Andrew
likes them so much.
''For me, Abba are like the Everly Brothers . . . it's an incestual
thing . . . if that's a word. Abba's craft. I love their consistency.
The volume of stuff they did. Raising hairs on your hands and lumps in
your throat.
''And except for the glitter, there's the feeling that it could be you
doing it. That has a good cause-and-effect on people . . . perfecting
the idea of a family singing along in every room with you when you're on
the telly.
''I've never put on an Abba record and taken it off before it's
finished. It's never been a wrong call. They're very clever and very
lucky. Their songs are like movies, but they allow you to write the
screenplay. Lindsay Kemp, right? We never got to meet him in the
sixties, we were so busy then, we had no time, but he came to Bogota . .
. the state of his feet, he works . . . and he was wild.
''Cut to the chase . . . Lindsay Kemp came in, and he started -- and
suddenly I had no luggage. And Abba can do that.'' Andrew fixes me with
a stare of urgent triumph. Do I understand what he's trying to say? I
think I do.
Neither Andrew nor Tony met Abba. Didn't even try to. ''The book's not
meant as an intrusion. It's meant to be another reward. It's not like
the old days when we were making stuff up to keep the New Musical
Express filled every week.''
What do you think of current British music? ''Portishead . . . a
voice, and songs, and they're radio-friendly, they're good. The rest of
the industry is over-salaried peons who don't know when to leave. We're
in the world of overkill. We didn't know that after the Rolling Stones
there was going to be a second chapter . . . and we'd have no control of
what was written.''
As the man who dreamt up Would You Let Your Daughter Marry A Rolling
Stone for the Daily Express, fancy writing me a similarly-arresting
headline for this story?
''I like that. Very nice. So much so that I'm stumped. Hang on. I'm
not going to give you something clever with no substance.''
As Andrew ponders, we ruminate about the Glasgow band who signed to
Immediate in the sixties, the Poets. ''The lawyers for my first
marriage, to Sheila Clyne, which took place in Glasgow . . . why did we
go to Glasgow to get married, Tony?
''Anyway, these lawyers said: 'By the way, we've got this band.' So we
saw them, signed them. I met this taxi-driver in London about four years
ago who was more impressed that I'd signed the Poets than managed the
Stones . . . Now We're Through, what a single.
''Got one!''
What?
''A headline. Thank You For The Music -- Now Buy The Book.''
If you're selling, Mr Oldham and Mr Calder, we can't help buying.

Bujumbura, Friday
BURUNDI'S capital Bujumbura faced a second night of chaos, renewing
fears that the country may slide into genocide like neighbouring Rwanda.
Gunfire and grenades echoed around the streets and smoke hung in the
air after fighting between groups of Hutus and Tutsis started this
afternoon.
At least one man was shot down in broad daylight in the city centre
and several houses in nearby suburbs were ablaze.
The city centre was deserted long before the 7pm curfew and telephone
lines in many parts of the capital had been cut.
French Co-operation Minister Bernard Debre, who flew into Bujumbura
yesterday as part of a European delegation to study the crisis, said
French women and children could be evacuated at Easter.
Aid workers say the international community is not doing enough to
stop Burundi sliding into the bloodbath endured by Rwanda last year.
''I'm sure violence will increase over the next few weeks, not just
here in Bujumbura and in the north but all over the country,'' said
Graziella Godain of the French charity Medicins sans Frontieres.
On Sunday three Belgians were shot dead in an ambush by Hutu
guerrillas on a road outside the capital.
Violence has surged in the last 18 months since the country's first
democratically-elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, was killed by
renegade Tutsi troops.
A fresh wave of clashes erupted recently, killing and wounding dozens
of people. The increasingly shaky government has appealed for calm but
taken little action.
Up to one million people were killed in genocide involving Hutus and
Tutsis in Rwanda. In Burundi up to 50,000 people were killed in fighting
in 1993 after Ndadaye's death.
Bujumbura's central market is more often closed than open these days
and there are reports of kidnappings. A bus with 30 people aboard
disappeared when gunman seized it on Thursday.--Reuter.

THE Dillons bookstore in Inverness is to close as part of the
restructuring of the chain following its acquisition by Thorn EMI for
#36m.
After undertaking a comprehensive review of the business, Thorn EMI
has decided to retain 100 outlets trading as Dillons, Hatchards and
Hodges Figgis throughout the UK and Ireland.
These shops represent around 90% of the turnover generated by the
Dillons chain in the year ended December 31 and account for 1875 jobs,
or 85% of the total staff.
Thorn looked at 140 trading outlets and property leases after it had
agreed to buy selected assets and liabilities of the Dillons chain from
the receiver of Pentos group.
The outlets not selected include 20 Claude Gill bargain bookstores
which remain with the receiver. A small number of stores are still under
negotiation.
Sir Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI, said the property review
had identified a number of high-rent stores that failed to meet the
criteria required for the successful future of the chain.
''It is our intention to restore the Dillons business to profitability
and to invest in its future growth,'' he said. In the first six months
of 1994, Pentos made a trading loss of #13m.
Thorn EMI will pay the employees affected by the closure programme,
more than 300 people, severence payments fully in line with their
previous employment contracts. Costs associated with the redundancy
programme are estimated to be #420,000.
A legacy of over-expansion during the consumer boom of the eighties
and high shop rents proved to be the downfall of Pentos, which went into
receivership earlier this month. Before that Pentos had voluntarily
placed its Athena posters and greetings card chain into receivership to
try to save the rest of the group.
Although the acquisition is initially dilutive, City analysts are
positive about the purchase because it provides an upmarket distribution
outlet for electronic publishing. CD-i and CD-ROM based titles are
growing rapidly and offer higher margins than books.

PATRICK BROGAN in Washington, Friday
THE Senate passed a line-item veto Bill last night, signifying the
largest shift in power from Congress to president in a generation.
The Senate version of the Bill has to be reconciled with the one
passed by the House of Representatives, but there is no doubt that the
measure will become law by the summer.
President Clinton is delighted. Like all his recent predecessors, he
has enthusiastically sought the authority to strike individual items
from spending Bills. This Bill was one of the main items on the
Republican agenda, and the vote is a triumph for Senator Bob Dole, the
Republican leader in the Senate.
Every year Congress prepares appropriations Bills for each of the 13
departments of government and they often include scores of millions of
dollars in special spending projects.
The senators from New York, for instance, one Democratic, one
Republican, repeatedly insert into the defence appropriations Bill money
to preserve the Grumman aircraft factory on Long Island, even though the
Pentagon has been trying to shut it down for years.
Every member of Congress has a special project in his district that he
tries to get through, and a large part of the political business in
Washington is trading between the demands of Congressmen.
Presidents have had very little to do in the process: they could
hardly veto the entire defence department appropriation Bill, some
$290bn (#1930m), because they object to a few hundred million in
unnecessary defence projects.
When the new law comes into effect, the president will be able to
strike any item he pleases. The two versions of the Bill promote
different methods of dealing with the presidential veto, but the one
likely to prevail is that a single veto can be overturned only by a
two-thirds majority in both houses.
This will kill off most ''pork-barrel'' spending projects. It will
give the president immense power over the political destiny of members
of Congress. If they want a project in their district, they must win the
approval not only of their party leaders and the chairman of the
committee, but of the president.
That Congress should submit to so important a shift in the balance of
power is all the more remarkable when a Republican Congress is handing
power to a Democratic president. It is altogether probable that Mr
Clinton will knock down the favourite projects of those Republican
members who oppose him most vociferously, including freshmen who
defeated Democratic incumbents last November.
The Republicans, of course, hope to win the White House in 1996. If
they fail, they may be stuck with a most unwelcome novelty. It has to be
renewed after five years, but it will probably be very difficult to
oppose it, once it has become law.

THE French Ministry of Defence does not usually pay much attention to
the annual military parade in Cyprus in honour of the national Greek
holiday.
In today's marchpast, however, many eyes will be pinned on six
French-made Exocet missiles -- the proof, the French and Cypriot
Governments say, that arms flown out of France last autumn were indeed
destined for this apparently harmless Mediterranean island, and not for
the revolutionary regime in Tehran.
In Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates and home last week
to the international Idex '95 arms fair, French arms manufacturers will
today be trying to persuade Arab clients that reports of a French
violation of the embargo on Iran are malicious nonsense.
Lies and spies: like the best espionage stories, France's version of
Irangate is already enmeshed in a mass of untruths, energetic
assertions, and angry denials.
Only one thing is sure: that allegations about embargo-breaking
published on Thursday can only harm France's arms industry and the
chances of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in the presidential election.
The only party likely to benefit is the United States.
The weekly magazine L'Express, usually well informed, alleged last
week that France's Minister of the Interior, Charles Pasqua, last
October mastermined the exportation to Tehran of arms, ''probably air to
ground missiles''.
An Algerian airliner had flown the cargo from France to Cyprus, from
whence an Iranian aircraft transferred it to Tehran.
Even by the standards of French politicians made nervous by the
presidential election campaign, the official counterattack against
L'Express has been massive.
Mr Balladur issued a statement saying the report was untrue, while his
spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy described it as yet another ''beneath the
belt'' blow in the campaign. Mr Pasqua described the article as
''misinformation'' and took steps to sue the magazine.
The French Foreign Office, quoted as a source in the article, denied
all knowledge of anything and the Algerian Government denied all
involvement.
The Cypriot Government then admitted having received a cargo of French
missiles in October, but denied they had gone further east, and said
they would be on show in today's military parade.
The French Defence Minister Francois Leotard has voiced not only his
own feelings but those of many in the French Foreign Office and the
Ministry of the Interior. Without naming the United States, he said it
was likely that ''one of France's major competitors in the arms market
in the Gulf'' had fed a story to L'Express.
If such is the case, the timing was exquisite. US Defence Secretary
William Perry was touring the Gulf States last week and named Iran as
the main security threat in the region. On Thursday, the day the article
appeared, France signed a #156m deal for 12 helicopters with the United
Arab Emirates.
French arms experts are worried that future contracts with the Gulf
States, in a market estimated at between #25 and #50 billion over the
next five years, in which France and the USA are the main contenders,
will be compromised.
If American intelligence is behind the report, they picked an ideal
target in Mr Pasqua. In December 1993 he turned down a Swiss demand to
extradite two Iranians accused of murdering an opponent of the Tehran
regime and sent them home instead.
Indeed, his strange kindness towards Iran over the years, and his
meddling in Middle Eastern affairs, which so riles France's Foreign
Affairs Ministry, have earned him the nickname among Iranian diplomats
of ''France's Minister of Iranian Foreign Affairs''.

Gainesville, Florida, Friday
A SECOND mistrial was declared early today in the case of a Florida
teenager accused of shooting British tourist Gary Colley dead in 1993.
After seven hours, the jury trying 18-year-old John ''Billy Joe''
Crumitie, said it was unable to reach a verdict on murder charges
against him and the judge declared a mistrial.
Crumitie is charged with murdering Mr Colley, 34, from Bradford, West
Yorkshire, and wounding his girlfriend Margaret Jagger at a remote
highway rest stop in northern Florida.
He is the only one of four youths charged in the botched robbery who
did not reach a plea bargain with prosecutors.
Crumitie's first trial ended in a hung jury last November and a
mistrial was also declared.
Miss Jagger just shook her head at the news as prosecutors said they
planned to go to trial once again.
Her mother Muriel said she had received a telephone call from her
saying: ''I'm just absolutely shattered by it all.''
Mr Colley's mother said at her home in Bradford that the uncertainty
would drag on for the family.
''It is very hard to carry on with your life with trial after trial,''
said Mrs Brenda Armitage. ''I can't understand what is happening over
there.''

Women artists did not fare very well at the beginning of the century.
But, says Liz Taylor, at least some of their work is appreciated now
THE first time I ever heard of Phoebe Anna Traquair was about 20 years
ago at a Sotheby's auction when an enamelled box, exquisitely painted by
her, was among the lots on offer. It fetched a modest price because,
like me, most of the people at the auction knew little about her.
Since then she has achieved greater fame, especially during the last
Edinburgh Festival when murals she did for a church in Mansfield Place,
Edinburgh, were exhibited to an admiring public.
Phoebe Moss, as she was called before she married, was born in Dublin
in 1852 and died in Edinburgh in 1936, but during her lifetime and for
decades afterwards she was not awarded the recognition that her talents
deserved. That fate is sadly shared by many other women artists of the
period. Even the now much-lauded Gwen John, whom some critics rate as a
superior artist to her famous brother Augustus, was never taken really
seriously by the art world while she was alive.
Women artists, on the whole, were relegated to painting ''pretty''
pictures of cottages with flower-filled gardens, playful puppies and
kittens, religious pictures, romantic Arthurian or ethereal fairy-tale
scenes. Like many others, Phoebe Traquair took the religious road.
After studying at Dublin School of Art for two years, and winning the
Queen's prize for a painted fan while there, at the age of 20 she
married Ramsay H Traquair who, in 1884, became Keeper of Natural History
at the Royal Scottish Museum in Edinburgh. The couple lived for the rest
of their lives at 8 Dean Park Crescent in the city.
There Phoebe Traquair continued her artistic interests, executing
embroideries, illuminating manuscripts, and designing bookplates. She
also worked with enamels like the little box that first alerted me to
her existence. What was to make her name, however, were the mural
paintings she executed in the mid 1880s, often in co-operation with an
artist called John Duncan who, like her, was very keen on the Celtic
revival.
Murals she painted for the mortuary of the Sick Children's Hospital in
Edinburgh were later resited in the chapel; she made enamelled armorial
plates for every stall in the Thistle Chapel; painted a series of panels
for St Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh; and did the murals in the Catholic
Apostolic Church, East London Street.
She also worked in Glasgow, painting altarpieces in three churches
including All Saints' Church in St Mary's Cathedral. She decorated the
chancel of a church in Nottingham and made a triptych for the Cathedral
of St James in Chicago.
In spite of her output and the approval of the architect Lorimer who
frequently employed her, she was refused honorary membership of the
Royal Scottish Academy in 1900 but in 1920 the diehard reactionaries
relented and made her the first woman honorary member.
One of her more unusual artistic enterprises was to decorate a grand
piano for the Tennant family who owned Lympne Castle in Kent. The member
of the family who commissioned the paintings was a collector of Dante
Gabriel Rossetti's work, and images from Rossetti's sonnet Willowwood
were devised by Traquair for her design on the piano keyboard panel.
Inside the piano case she painted nine watercolours on themes ranging
from The Song of Solomon to Scottish scenery and when she completed the
commission in 1908, she said of her handiwork: ''I do honestly think it
is the best painting I have ever done, wood is so delightful to work
on.''
The piano stood in the Great Hall at Lympne for some years before
being moved to a Tennant house in Scotland but after that it
''disppeared'' until 1952 when a couple on holiday from America bought
it in Inverness for #350 and shipped it to the USA. Thereafter, although
its existence was known by scholars in this country, its whereabouts
were a mystery.
Now, however, the American owners have decided to sell and have
returned the piano to Britain where it is likely to fetch a better price
than in America. On March 28 it comes up for auction at Phillips' rooms
in London, and will be star lot in their Art Nouveau sale. Because it is
in magnificent condition, with Phoebe Anna Traquair's paintings still
strong and vibrant, the piano is expected to fetch between #60,000 and
#80,000.
If that does not put Traquair into the front rank of
turn-of-the-century painters, nothing will.
Another woman painter who was marginalised by the prejudices of her
time was Mabel Dawson who was born in Edinburgh in 1887 and died there
in 1965, being part of the time contemporaneous with Phoebe Traquair.
Dawson's father was a canon of St Mary's Cathedral and the family
lived in Palmerston Place where she had a studio. Not surprisingly, she
produced many works on religious themes and one of them, entitled The
Server showing an angelic young boy lighting the candles on a church
altar, which Dawson painted in 1912, turned up in an auction in Suffolk
recently where it was bought by Diana Bruce who, with her husband Bill,
owns Mainhill Gallery in Ancrum near Jedburgh. It is now part of an
exhibition that runs at Mainhill Gallery until April 9.
The painting caught Diana Bruce's fancy and from details on the back
of the canvas she found out that the server in the picture was an
eight-year-old boy called Henry J Wilson and the church was described as
All Saints, now St Michael and All Saints, in Brougham Place, Edinburgh.
She was intrigued to find out more about Henry and visited the church
where records revealed that he was confirmed there at the age of 15, but
after that the trail went cold and Bruce has not been able to find out
any more about him.
She would love to know anything anyone can tell her about what
happened to the golden-haired young lad in the church's Lady Chapel.
MARKET TIP
Cleanliness is not next to godliness as far as antique furniture is
concerned.
''Dealers love dirt,'' said the Antiques Trade Gazette when describing
a sale held recently in Canterbury where two George IV dining tables
experienced different fates. The leaves of the first one had been found
behind a wardrobe and because they were very dirty, an estimate of only
around #1500 was put on the table. Another contemporary table with a
brightly repolished top had an estimate of around #3000. In the event,
the dirty table went for #4000 to a Surrey dealer and the squeaky-clean
one was sold to a Maltese buyer for #2800.

A Scotland which addresses the constitutional crisis while avoiding
the spiritual crisis may not necessarily be an attractive country to
inhabit. Ron Ferguson examines Christianity on trial
WHEN Rita, in Willy Russell's Educating Rita, goes back from
university to visit her old stamping ground, she becomes depressed in
her local pub and bursts out, ''There must be better songs to sing than
this!''
There's something wrong.
But then, this is a preacher speaking.
Parables of our time, Number 1. A working-class kid-made-good is
speaking frantically on the phone in Singapore. The sweat is pouring
down his neck. This game of Monopoly is becoming lethal.
Parables of our time, Number 2. One of the most wanted men in the
world sits staring at his computer screen. His skill as a hacker has
brought him the Visa numbers of 20,000 people. Neighbours describe him
as a ''loner''.
Parables of our time, Number 3. Stephen Norris, Minister for
Transport, says he prefers to travel alone in his own car. He can choose
his own music, set the temperature for his own comfort and, most
importantly, he doesn't have to sit beside any of the Great British
Public.
Parables of our time, Numbers 4 to1000. Take your pick.
There must be better songs to sing than this.
It's important not to exaggerate. Lots of people are doing rather
well, and that's a cause for celebration, rather than for lamentation by
sour-pussed preachers. Families which two generations ago were living in
hardship now own their own home, have a car, and enjoy holidays abroad
each year.
But there's something wrong, isn't there?
What has happened, for instance, to the vision of work and money being
shared, of many people working a three-day week and having lots of
leisure time? What we are witnessing instead is people working longer
hours than ever, on short-term contracts, watching their backs and
fearing their bosses.
Poorer people have always known this insecurity, but no-one has
bothered much. They are disposable, and they know it. I have seen it as
a minister in Easterhouse, time after time. The hopelessness of the
position in the urban and rural Sowetos of our nation is tangible. It
feeds the rapid growth of a despairing underclass tranquillised by a
drug-habit which exacts a terrible price.
The difference in the mid-1990s is that the professional classes are
feeling the bite. Insecurity is rampant now. As firms ''downsize'', it
is often managers who are shocked to be out in the street. Loyalty?
Forget it.
And the promise that the new technologies would set us all free?
Computers have led to more work for fewer people. As doctors and nurses
and teachers struggle to fill up endless forms and questionnaires, so
the burgeoning bureaucracies of the health and education services grow
apace. (This manic science has infected the Church, too. My former
colleague in Kirkwall, Brian Wilkinson, and I had to fill up a form sent
by the Kirk headquarters. Among the questions was the following gem:
''What are the likes and dislikes of your community? What could it
possibly mean? We decided not to spend too much time on it. Under likes,
we wrote, ''Cheese and onion crisps,'' and under dislikes, we put,
''Sailing across the Pentland Firth.'' Nothing has been heard since.
Does the silence mean that the questionnaire was simply stuck in a
filing cabinet? Or is there a big missionary map at 121 George Street
with a flashing sign above Kirkwall saying, ''Cheese and onion
crisps?'') I am reminded of W
H Auden's poem:
Thou shalt not answer
questionnaires
Nor quizzes upon world affairs,
Nor with compliance
Take any test. Thou shalt not sit
With statisticians, nor commit
A social science.
The sense of disaffection is made worse by looking at Parliament. So
much of what happens in the Westminster beatpit seems far removed from
the concerns of ordinary people. National institutions such as the
monarchy, the Church, and the law courts, are increasingly felt to be
out of touch, tarnished, eroded, less and less able to respond to real
human concerns. The situation is compounded by the manic whirl of the
media. Widespread cynicism is the inevitable consequence.
The malaise is difficult to quantify, but it is there, spreading like
a contagion. It is a felt sense, a taste of ash in the mouth. At the
very point at which we should be feeling good about our lives, there is
a sense of silent disintegration. The quiet spread of mysterious,
hard-to-pinpoint afflictions of the immune system feels like a parable
pointing to the erosion of something vital at the core of our life.
There is, not too far from the surface, a sense of loss, of grief.
Suddenly, at strange times and in unpredictable places, a millennial
fear pops up -- a fear of a new barbarism, of a Dark Age. This is no
nation ''at ease with itself''. Nor should it be. No wonder the
Government has problems with the ''feel-good'' factor.
The post-modern contagion is directly related to the focus on
excessive individualism, and a corresponding loss of human compassion.
The loner at his computer, hacking into confidential financial records,
represents the end of a particular line. It signals an amoral, sad,
disturbing extreme. Despite all the surrounding technology, it pictures
a disconnected, lonely life -- disconnected from the context of
relationships, values, meaning. Virtual reality has become substitute
reality.
The development of the individual is entirely desirable. Economic
wellbeing has provided a springboard for a welcome sense of freedom and
new possibilities. The privatising tendency runs riot, however, and
destroys the very matrix of individual development. Once we are defined
primarily as consumers, we start to consume ourselves, like necrotising
fasciitis, the deadly flesh-eating disease.
The healthy development of individual personhood requires, demands,
relationship with other persons. Uprooted from this context, it becomes
distorted and damaging. The ''in-your-face'' lifestyle of rampant modern
capitalism is ultimately seriously damaging for everyone, and should
carry a Government health warning.
The crisis is one of fragmentation, of meaningless. How we address it
will determine our future. The constitution of our country is in
desperate need of a radical overhaul. But a Scotland which addresses the
constitutional crisis while bodyswerving the spiritual crisis may not
necessarily be an attractive country to inhabit.
But where can we find help?
Enter evangelist on left, with a quick-fix dose of religion and a
placard saying ''I told you so''? No. Nor can it ever be that simple
again. It is Christianity itself which is on trial. After a bloody
century of wars in which ''Christian'' nations have beaten the living
hell out of each other, and in which representatives of one European
Christian nation have murdered six million Jews, chirpy, confident
evangelism is an obscenity. Chaste language and ambition are definitely
in order.
Theology is no longer the Queen of Sciences. She looks tired, her
mascara is running, and she looks for all the world as if she has been
indecently assaulted. As Lawrence Durrell put it, ''Theology is very old
ice cream, pretty tame sausage.''
But it needn't be like that. Theology can be an exciting discipline,
especially where honesty and open curiosity are not allowed but
welcomed. The paradigms of Christian faith are still very powerful when
freed from their set-in-concrete contexts, and when ministers give up
the need to protect their flock from hard questions. At such a time of
crisis, when so many of the foundations are shaken, the fundamentalist
and authoritarian options inevitably gain ground. But under hard
scrutiny, fundamentalist theology retreats into a series of circular
arguments from which there is no escape. Hungry people look for
theological bread and they are given the stones of a hard, unbelievable
ideology. So they look elsewhere.
Theology is for consenting adults. People understand perfectly well
that talk about God can never pretend to be a literal science. As
Professor Robert Carroll of Glasgow University puts it: ''If the
definition of the divine is to include that which is beyond human
comprehension, then any account of God which knows as much as
traditional religions claim to know about such a being offends against
that principle. Creeds and confessions, Bibles and Korans, all appear to
be able to specify the inside-leg measurements of their god to such a
degree of accuracy that they can persecute and prosecute any who differ
from them in any detail.''
Many people hold that Christianity is incredible, discredited, played
out. But for quite a number in the West, Christianity may still be the
main avenue by which the quest for ultimate meaning is pursued. At the
end of the second millennium, Christianity itself stands in need of
radical transformation, perhaps of the dramatic type faced by the early
Church when it had to make a choice between the security of remaining a
Jewish sect or the risky adventure of becoming a universal movement.
We need a new spirituality. The tragedy of much spirituality today is
that it has been torn from its natural context of justice and care for
the neighbour and individualised almost to vanishing point. It has
degenerated into technique without content -- deep breathing through
alternate nostrils, the chanting of mantras, the focus on the self to
the point of self-absorption. As a form of relaxation for stressed
people this is fine, but as a way of finding meaning for our lives it
has serious limitations. It simply cannot bear the weight.
The official religious track record is at best ambiguous, and at worst
lethal. But thankfully, Christianity also has alternative versions to
the once-dominant all-singing all-dancing persecuting triumphalist
ideology. They speak of a body-mind-spirit spirituality which is tested
in how people treat each other. At its heart is a transcendent sense of
meaning, associated with persistent rumours about unconditional love at
the heart of things. Somewhere at the core of this lies the shaping of
an answer to our deep sense of loss.
But, this is a preacher speaking. And you expect this kind of
sentimental guff from preachers.
What about the Church in all this, particularly the Auld Kirk of
Scotland?
The Kirk is like a prizefighter who has had one fight too many.
Bloodied, the fighter gets up from the canvas, ready to face more
punishment. Many people are pleased the fighter is getting a ''doing''
-- he's had it coming for years. Lots would like to see him counted down
for good. The requiem for an unsteady heavyweight can't come soon
enough.
Does it matter?
I think it does. For all its faults, and the undeniably dark side of
its history, the Kirk has been influential in the shaping of Scotland,
for better as well as for worse. It is part of the soul of Scotland.
From John Knox onwards, it has had a radical vision of an educated and
democratic country, and a healthy refusal to bow the knee to
principalities and powers. At its best moments, the Kirk has represented
a broad, inclusive, generous tradition. Even at its weakest times, it
has helped keep alive the rumour of God in Scotland. It has insisted
that truth, however elusive, is a public matter, and that people in
power have to be held to account before God and the people. At a time of
low national esteem, it has provided the nearest thing to a Scottish
Parliament, and has helped to sustain the dream of new constitutional
possibilities. Yes, it does matter.
But the Kirk can be of service in the shaping of a new Scotland only
if it comes clean; if it stops shouting at bewildered people the way
folk do when they try to make foreign visitors understand how to get to
Lochgelly, acknowledges its historic wounds and present-day weaknesses,
and invites whoever wants to come to join it on pilgrimage. In company
with people from other traditions, it can point towards some of the
beautiful and unexplored treasures of the whole Christian enterprise. It
may be that not many people will want to come on this particular
journey, but it could be surprising. Increasing numbers who have come up
against the limitations of consumerism and its harsh ideology are asking
''Is this all there is?'' and are looking for more compassionate and
more meaningful ways to live.
This year sees the centenary of the birth of a great Scottish
churchman. For all his theological and psychological fault lines, George
Fielden MacLeod embodied something very important in the Scottish
tradition. He was a profoundly spiritual man who would have nothing to
do with any privatised spirituality which avoids the issue of ''who is
my neighbour?'' He spoke up for the under-privileged and the vulnerable,
yet he had a sense of the glory and mystery of God which he communicated
in brilliant, multifaceted poetic language.
We are all post-Christian children of a fragmented and disquieted era.
Many of the old bearings have gone in this age of man-come-of-age, of
post-modern woman with a question mark where her soul used to be. The
experience of pilgrimage today can feel like following a traveller who
walks in an eerie silence broken only by the tapping of his own white
stick. It is a fearsome and exciting time to be alive.
In Scotland, we approach a time of new possibilities.
Where can we find better songs than this?
Some of them are there already. We've known them all the time, way
below the surface. And we can write new ones -- songs of bread and
spirit that include the weak and the vulnerable. And in our singing, we
can keep alive the dream of new possibilities and traces of angels:
until that day when the loving Stranger, who insists on calling us his
friends, returns with nail prints in his transfigured and translucent
hands ... until that day, beyond pain and death, when we sing a new song
in an unimaginable promised land.
But this is a preacher speaking.
The Rev Ron Ferguson is minister of St Magnus Cathedral, Orkney. A
former journalist, he is the author of a number of books, including

Sally Beamish (pictured), mother of two young sons, is a prolific and
highly regarded composer. She describes what she eats and drinks on a
typically creative working day.
I GOT up as usual about 7am and had a cup of ginseng tea. I've found
that ordinary tea makes me tired. Ginseng tea sort of wakes me up. I
made packed lunches for the kids to take to school and helped my husband
get the kids into the car. As soon as they were gone, I had a piece of
toast, while clearing up breakfast. Then down to work. For lunch, Robert
made soup as he often does. If I'm very pushed for time he brings it
into the music room. We lunched together with soup, salad, and a cup of
tea -- ginseng again.
Back to the music room. Robert teaches or rehearses in the afternoon
(he's a cellist) so I have the kids after school. They're still at the
stage where they won't eat what we eat so I made them baked potatoes
with grated cheese, ham, and veg and we had a stir-fry with baked
potatoes between 5.30 and 6pm.
We try to eat with the kids. After they're in bed, there's paperwork
to do. I had a cup of cocoa about 10 and got to bed quite early. I will
occasionally have a glass of wine, but only when everything's done.
It makes you more productive if time is limited; on the whole, I try
to trick myself into not having windows when I can sit down. Things like
cups of tea can be quite dangerous!

ALTHOUGH it bothers me sometimes, I still swear too much. My only
defence is that, for me, there's nothing that relieves tension better
than a well-placed expletive. I'm fairly inured to others' cursing, and
I can't get shocked by four-letter words. Sometimes the effort of not
swearing is more ridiculous.
Last Saturday I saw a column by an ex-rugby internationalist in an
English-based newspaper (a journalistic euphemism for the Sun). I don't
normally buy it, but my duties at an Edinburgh-based radio station
require access to all the newspapers' sports sections. The tabloids,
though, consist mostly of pictures of semi-professional footballers
posing in their everyday work gear, topped by a punning headline (for
teachers it would read ''Top of the Class'', or if he's a butcher it
would be ''United for the chop?'').
Anyway, as part of the rugby match preview, he wrote that he hoped
Scotland would give ''. . . the arrogant English a right good kick up
the a***e'' (their asterisk). The rest of the paper had been full of
sexual innuendo, half-truths, and irrelevancies, but somehow they felt
that the word ''arse'' was too offensive for their readers.
It never ceases to amaze me that people can get so offended by bad
language. TV goes to ridiculous lengths to hide four letters. Films are
shown where some American cop is bundling a drug dealer into custody,
and the hardened criminal will suddenly adopt a bizarre American/Welsh
accent and shout ''Git your hands off me you bandit. Free you, mother
framer!''
Even those who haven't noticed the shift in accent can sense that
while his voice says ''bandit'', his eyes (and lips) are saying
something a tad stronger. Any interest in the film dissipates once you
realise that it has been sanitised by some ad-man whose main aim is to
avoid upsetting the makers of whichever fizzy drink he's trying to flog.
It's not enough for films to be good any more, they have to have their
characters neutralised so they can be watched by the nine-year-old kids
whose teeth the drink-maker is desperately trying to rot. The nine
o'clock watershed has become obsolete: now we have to watch Sesame
Street all night because over-indulgent parents can neither throw young
Norbert up to bed, nor tell Kelly-Marie that she cannot have a
television in her room.
My first experience of language censorship was on the Billy Connolly
record about wellies, which, incidentally, must surely be the only
number one song ever to have featured the word ''pleurisy''. The line
that goes ''. . . When some beep takes off his wellies'' always
intrigued me. I presume, with the wisdom of adulthood, that he said
''bugger'' (if there are asterisks here, they're not mine), but I don't
know for sure as I've only ever heard the song on the radio.
To the primary seven ear, the beep could have hidden anything, and I
would have been disappointed had I known that it was only ''bugger'' --
even my granny used that word!
Viewers get particularly upset about swearing on TV. The ''F'' and
''B'' words (to avoid any offence, we'll just call them X and Y) possess
the capacity to generate sackfuls of complaints no matter the time of
transmission.
In contrast, Del Boy continually calls Rodney a plonker with its heavy
phallic undertone, causing only teary eyed amusement all round.
''Plonker'' is really just a spoken beep, sheltering us from words we
all know a similar character would use in real life. Strangely, people
are quite happy to know that someone said X, as long as they don't
actually hear it. It's almost as if they're quite content as long as
they feel that someone has taken the trouble to shelter them, that
they'll not feel a need to complain.
Are subtitles dubbed? I just wonder if it's the guttural sounds that
offend, and it would be pretty pointless dubbing for a group of people
so adept at lip-reading.
People maintain that TV has to be really careful because it's a
particularly invasive medium, arriving uninvited into our living rooms
and forcing its opinions on us. Anyone who thinks TV is like that has
obviously not met my dad. That's invasive.
Television is no more ''uninvited'' than newspapers. In my house
watching TV requires you to switch on, turn the volume down, stop
whichever Disney video is on constant-play mode, and finally chisel away
the 3in coating of Weetabix from the screen. If anyone can find a
television that cleans itself up before switching itself on then I'd be
delighted to have my living room invaded.
The main argument for language censorship before 9pm is that it stops
children hearing and repeating swear words. I agree: kids should have
more imagination. There should be a national competition to encourage
schoolchildren to invent new curses. These words should have no previous
recognised meaning, and should contain a maximum of two syllables and,
if possible, the letter ''K''. Kids might invent words as expressive as
''gok'' (Cumbernauld c1975. Noun: meaning ''idiot'') or ''dobber'' (see:
''gok''). These words have major advantages: they help to release
tension, don't offend anyone and, more importantly, can still make you
smirk when you recount them 20 years later.
Broadsheet newspapers don't get too hung up on swearing. After a
fruity court case, the big papers will have every last syllable in its
place, keeping the flavour of the session intact. The tabloids, however,
will revel in the ''Wow, he said bastard!'' school of journalism.
The attitude to four-letter words supports the observation that the
tabloids' style approximates to a reading age of eight. They should just
go the whole hog and call page three girls soppy cissies, and insist
that the photo-desk draws specs and moustaches on their faces.
There are two occasions when swearing is completely inexcusable.
1.) When it's done by a woman, especially inside a football ground (a
case of the unwanted shouting words they shouldn't understand at a game
they'll never understand).
2.) When it's a product of laziness rather than emotion. The ''F''
word in particular is an easy resort because of its ability to act as a
noun, a verb, an adverb, an adjective, or just a good old exclamation.
The word may be versatile, but that's what they said about Mike Yarwood,
and look what happened to him.
On a practical note, most people recommend that in a stressful
situation, you try to calm down and count to 10 before you lose your
temper and start swearing. That's quite right: there's no point in just
rushing in with the same old hackneyed tirade, and leaving yourself
feeling foolish once things have calmed down. So while you're counting
to 10, just make a mental note of all your favourites, then you can
really give the bank manager what for.

As Hollywood prepares for the annual Oscar bash, Douglas Thompson
takes a look at the candidates for the coveted golden statuette.
IT is where angels fear to tread time but let's be a devil. Up in Las
Vegas the polyester-clad oddsmakers will not give you much of a deal on
backing Tom Hanks and Jodie Foster as Best Actor and Actress for the
Oscars on Monday evening. Precedent dictates that ''worthy'' movies like
Hanks's Forrest Gump and Foster's Nell find the approval of the voters
of the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences. Sadly, both films
weren't great but 1994, for which the awards are being presented, was
not vintage cinema.
More funerals than weddings.
Gump which has hard-to-believe 13 nominations and made money --
another important Midas for gold-plated statuettes -- is Disney with
people, not animation. Nell has the always watchable Foster as a
backwoods recluse. She is so out of the real world she is superhuman.
Her co-stars are Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson but the Academy and
you won't remember them, for Foster steals what show there is. Both of
the Oscar front-runners are very mom and pop and apple pie. The bookies
won't give you mortgage relief. You have to look elsewhere.
The shoo-in for Best Picture appears to be Gump, but if it's a race
Robert Redford's admirable Quiz Show will take it over Four Weddings and
a Funeral. The serious threat for Hanks's simpleton Gump is Pulp Fiction
which created its own genre -- film noir on smack. Quentin Tarantino is
nominated as Best Director for a film which shortly after you start
watching you want to see again. There is so much going on. Tarantino has
moved so fast from Reservoir Dogs and True Romance to the Cannes winner
Pulp that the former video store salesman is now getting the
kick-away-the-pedestal treatment.
That movement will hinder his chances on Monday. But the major plus
for him is that his films are making money, and in Tinseltown box office
is as vital as worthy art. Hence the tinsel. John Travolta's go in Pulp
Fiction as a druggie killer will not help endorse his chances at the
Best Actor Oscar. But in illegal Hollywood betting games they are giving
odds-on to Travolta against Hanks who won the 13[1/2]in statuette last
year for his show as a lawyer dying from Aids in Philadelphia.
The fanciable outsider in this especially handicapped year -- remember
this is a horse race and there are no certainties -- is Paul Newman. Now
70 he was perfect in Nobody's Fool and any of the 4972 dithering voters
might just have put their mark next to his name. It would produce a
''worthy'' standing ovation.
The Best Actor contest is rounded out by Morgan Freeman for The
Shawshank Redemption which everybody liked but nobody saw. Nigel
Hawthorne would be delighted to say ''Yes, Please'' and be the winner
for The Madness of King George but if there is a Brit win it is likely
to be of a different gender. The Oscars being the Oscars, Hanks remains
the bet.
Britain's Miranda Richardson is a hugely admired actress in Hollywood
and has been nominated before, for Damage. This year she is a contender
for Best Actress for Tom and Viv, running with Susan Sarandon (The
Client), Winona Ryder (Little Women), Foster for Nell, and her major
opposition and probable winner, Jessica Lange, for Blue Sky, a movie
which had to be lifted off the video shelves (shown in American cinemas
in December last year) to become eligible for the awards. Lange is the
wise bet.
The one genuine hot shot is Martin Landau as Best Supporting Actor. He
plays horror-movie star Bela Lugosi to Johnny Depp's director Ed Wood,
and for all the talk of our Paul Scofield in Quiz Show, there doesn't
appear to be a battle in this category.
The same goes for Best Supporting Actress. Dianne Wiest, a Woody Allen
veteran, is the winner for Bullets Over Broadway. The more lavishly
endowed ladies Helen Mirren (The Madness of King George) and Uma Thurman
(Pulp Fiction) will presumably not go home alone but without Oscar. As
will Wiest's co-star Jennifer Tilly and Rosemary Harris, who turned in a
memorable performance in Tom and Viv. Landau and Wiest are the ones who
will show.
Like Landau, the director Robert Zemeckis appears a bet you cannot not
make for Forrest Gump. His opposition for Best Director includes Redford
for Quiz Show, Tarantino for Pulp Fiction, Woody Allen for Bullets Over
Broadway, and Krzysztof Kleslowski for Red.
The Madness of King George is the biggie in Brit nominations. As well
as Nigel Hawthorne for Best Actor and Helen Mirren for Best Supporting
Actress the writer of the play/movie, Alan Bennett, is nominated for his
script. It's Bennett's year. His collection of prose, Writing Home, has
been a publishing sensation. Woody Allen, like Bennett, prefers the
spotlight on his work rather than his personal life. Allen has had a
couple of bad years, plagued by child abuse charges from former lover
Mia Farrow. On Monday he will be playing the clarinet in New York's
Greenwich Village while nominated for two Oscars as writer and director
of Bullets Over Broadway.
Tartan hopes are on Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life which was
written and directed by Peter Capaldi. It is nominated as Best
Live-Action Short. The production money came from BBC Scotland and the
Scottish Film Production Fund.
Eat Drink Man Woman will win the Oscar for Best Foreign Film.
An alternative list might have included The Lion King, Tommy Lee Jones
as troubled baseball great Ty Cobb, Gary Oldman in Immortal Beloved --
Satan on Prozac -- and Big Arnold's True Lies, which was an
entertainment.
BBC2 are doing the Oscars 'live' starting at 3am Monday/Tuesday. If
you get up late all you will miss is Best Supporting Actress (Dianne
Wiest) and the waffle.
But the 67th Academy Awards will open with the Make 'em Laugh number
performed on screen by Donald O'Connor in MGM's 1952 classic Singin' in
the Rain. ''Live'' on stage will be Rocky Horror Show graduate and
accomplished actor Tim Curry with Kathy Najimy and young star Mara
Wilson doing the honours. The montage of today and yesterday will
continue with turns by W C Fields, the Marx Brothers, Woody Allen, and
Marilyn Monroe. Groucho to Monroe: ''Real diamonds! They must be worth
their weight in gold!''
Which Oscars are. But there are such things as dumb bucks. Every Oscar
win means a jump in salary for those involved. As does a box office
bonanza. The ''star'' expects to get the pick of the script crop. Bruce
Willis wanted Hamlet after Die Hard. Michael J Fox, Charlie Sheen, and
Woody Harrelson thought it was their own turf after success.
Willis slumped. He saved himself by doing small cameo shows in Pulp
Fiction and Nobody's Fool, and for comparatively little money. It was
showy roles rather than big pay-offs. John Travolta's comeback with Pulp
Fiction is being cashed in by his agents. Just a couple of weeks ago his
asking price was $9m a film. Now it is $10m. That's what his people
demanded from United Artists for his involvement with Fireworks. The
studio passed.
Patrick Swayze, who has been as elusive as a ghost for the past couple
of years -- sad showings like City of Joy and Father Hood -- acted for
almost nothing in Disney's Tall Tale this year. Everyone says he is
brilliant, and so is the film.
Tom Hanks -- the safety bet for Oscar Monday -- has had a fine run
with Sleepless in Seattle, Philadelphia and is now nominee bandleader as
Forrest Gump. His agents now want $15m a movie.
Gump's maybe not so dumb.

THEY carry their passports on their faces. I've forgotten who said it,
but the phrase came starkly to mind with the news that the Government is
intent on another clampdown on immigration and asylum seekers.
How do you imagine employers faced with stiff fines for employing
illegal immigrants will check on the background of people applying for a
job? A long bureaucratic trawl, perhaps, through official records at the
Home Office? Sheafs of time-consuming, costly correspondence with the
requisite departments of employment, social security, or the Foreign
Office? Nah. Just look at the colour of the face, see, simple. And it
would of course be much easier to make it work if we introduced a system
of identity cards, now wouldn't it . . .
Last November a leaked Conservative Central Office report on the
causes of disaffection among ''natural'' Tory voters identified
immigration as one of the core values of the defectors. Written by John
Maples, the party's deputy chairman and a former Treasury Minister, it
was based on extensive research among people who voted Conservative in
April 1992 but wouldn't now.
It found that the voters felt they had been let down by the
Conservative Government, but added: ''. . . many of these individuals'
other views -- very right-wing views on crime and immigration . . . deep
disapproval of scrounging -- make them 'natural' Conservatives''.
It is, then, hardly surprising to find that the broad outlines of a
legislative programme for next year, disclosed months ahead of the usual
parliamentary timetable, contain -- like a moth-eaten rabbit pulled out
of a mouldy old hat -- plans to clamp down on immigration and asylum
procedures.
No, it's hardly surprising. Feeling good? No? Let's rummel up some
fear then, stoke the old terrors. Then you'll return on shaky legs to
the bosom of the Tory Party in the nick of time for the election.
Attaboy.
Let's look at the reality. Since 1993 when the Asylum and Immigration
Appeals Act came into effect, 80% of applications for asylum have been
rejected outright, as opposed to 16% before its introduction. In 1994
only 825 asylum seekers were granted full refugee status.
Amnesty International has accused the Government of systematically
violating international law over the detention of asylum seekers. A
study of 50 cases showed widespread detention for long periods without
explanation or opportunity to challenge the decision. Current
immigration laws provide officials with sweeping powers to subject
asylum seekers to indefinite detention without recourse to any court or
independent review body.
People have been held for up to 17 months. Others have been returned
to unknown fates in countries where death squads roam airports awaiting
the return of dissidents.
This Government is not alone in using the race card to gain favour
with voters. The evidence across Europe is of ruling parties using the
issue to win votes. A raft of policies is in place to exclude refugees
and asylum seekers from entering Fortress Europe.
The question arises: where is the wave of immigrants the Government so
fears? Immigration into the EU was rising until 1993. It has been
falling since. There was an increase in migrants fleeing conflict in
former Yugoslavia. But they were not granted asylum: only provisional
rights to stay. Now governments around Europe have started sending
people back to ''safe'' areas in Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo.
The assumed mass emigration from Eastern Europe has not materialised.
Immigration from Third World countries, former Commonwealth countries,
is virtually nil now. People born in this country can't get their
grannies in from Pakistan to attend their weddings for fear they might
hang about and erode our untouchably precious quality of life.
My favourite political conference of all time was the 1993
Conservative conference. For fans of fantastical voyages around truth it
was vintage stuff.
Out across the gilded auditorium, where rows of elderly people snoozed
and smiled and clapped in their sleep, Peter Lilley, like a small pink
English rose, unfurled to expose his sickly roots.
In a masterly conflation he evoked the three favourite conference
bogeys: foreigners, scroungers, and drug addicts became Superghoul, the
foreign, scrounging, drug addict.
Foreigners were filching our dole to finance their filthy habits:
''It's beyond the pale,'' he shouted. We all know what's beyond the
pale, don't we? The swarthy.
The idea that hordes of doped continentals were sneaking in the back
door to mug benefits offices and hit the jackpot was clearly a fantasy.
Yet the signal it sent reached beyond the upholstered ladies and
scrubbed faces of middle England writhing ecstatically, eyes rolling
heavenward, in the aisles. He was reaching out with clammy hand to hit
the clitoris of Tory unthinking.
It was Trollope who rather rudely said there was nothing that stank so
badly in the nose of a Tory politician that he could not swallow it in
the interests of getting a vote.
Odd that he should be Mr Major's favourite author. But then these are
the people who belt out Jerusalem thinking it's a hymn to Great
Britishness, in flagrant violation of William Blake's bitter intent.

YOU can't deny that the Material Girl is persistent. She has been
desperate to be ''Evita'' for a decade as the
on-off-on-again-off-again-on-again Lloyd-Webber musical has struggled to
move from stage to celluloid. Everyone from Meryl Streep to Linda
Ronstadt was to take the title role. Oliver Stone was last year's
director and the year before that it was Sydney Lumet and before that it
was Richard Attenborough. The paranoia and the paperwork involved has
been like the Marx Brothers at the opera, just not so amusing.
But -- for now -- Madonna gets centre stage. Britain's Alan Parker --
The Commitments among other memorable turns -- is to direct. And the
word is serious enough for the much more subdued lady to cancel her
concert tour to promote her Bedtime Stories album.
It may be the Oscars on Monday but for Hollywood veterans the big
event will be one week today. That is when Chasen's restaurant closes.
It may be on April 1 but it's no Fools' Day joke. This was the place
from which Ronald Reagan imported chilli to the White House, and where
Howard Hughes designed a bra for Jane Russell on a napkin. For once, he
was working to scale.
Angie Dickinson won't admit it, but this is where she would dine with
JFK. Wrinkled, gnarled, and, well, let's be truthful, getting on rather
a bit, the Chasen's clientele have done well to survive their tab. But
it was a watering hole where movie buffs could go and eat and think
Bogart and the rest of the romance of the movies. Chasen's is now to be
part of a shopping mall.
Oscar candidate Quentin Tarantino has decided he will not play
Napoleon Solo, the debonair superspy created by Robert Vaughn in
television's A Man From UNCLE. Pug-nosed Quentin thinks Keanu Reeve
might look better in the leather waistcoat and Beretta holster in his
big-screen resurrection. He still plans for Vaughn and Scots actor David
McCallum to make cameo appearances.
The aptly named Rhino films are to make a film version of Hunter S
Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The gonzo journalism king was
too busy with the bourbon -- and branch water -- and machine-gunning
posters of LBJ at his Woody Creek spread a good 20-minute drive from the
trendies of Aspen, Colorado, to discuss the casting this week. However
Stephen Nemeth of Rhino -- and he better be thick-skinned -- said of the
$20m dollar film: ''We're hoping the movie will be a yearly annuity for
us. A Mickey Mouse for the intelligentsia.''
VAL KILMER, as the new Caped Crusader, is sensational in Batman
Forever which you should see in June. Bob Kane, who created the Batman
characters for D C Comics in 1938, said: ''This is not really a sequel.
It's a brand-new ball game. It's an original.''
Western revival: there is word of a remake of The Searchers which made
John Wayne a serious person, and also of Red River and a string of other
Wayne/John Ford material. The copycat enthusiasm is because of the
wonderful reception for the re-release of Sam Peckinpah's The Wild
Bunch. The attitude seems to mirror that of William Holden's Pike Bishop
in that movie when he said: ''Let's do it.''

John Linklater fastens on to a riveting account of a ubiquitous
twentieth-century gadget and unlikely fashion accessory
IN Minnesota just over a century ago a big man called Whitcombe Judson
was struggling with a small ignominy. His bulk was making it
uncomfortable for him to lace his shoes. In another age Judson might
have considered slimming or investing in an alternative style of
footwear, but this was the first great phase of American technological
discovery, the quarter century which witnessed the arrival of the
telephone, the phonograph, the electric light, the box camera and the
typewriter. Judson's contribution was to solve his personal difficulty
with shoes by inventing the zip.
He called it the ''clasp locker''. That was the title of the
innovation accepted by the US Patent and Trademark Office on August 25,
1893, and granted patent number 504038. Judson's illustration might be
mistaken today for a pair of those dreadful central-zipped bootee
slippers, the most embarrassing sensible Christmas gift a pre-pubescent
youngster could receive in the late 1950s. The only visible difference
is that the sliding clasp in Judson's invention was removed after
zipping up, and turned upside down to unzip.
Manufacturing began in late 1895 through the Universal Fastener
Company. It was a disaster. There were problems with machining the
intricate mechanisms. The biggest order for the fastener in these lean
initial years was from the Post Office Department for 20 to be attached
to mail sacks. The order was never repeated.
A modified version was marketed from 1905 as the C-Curity fastener
with little more success. The C-Curity had a problematic feature. It was
insecure. Applied to skirts, when ladies bent over the fastner would pop
open. Judson baled out of the company the next year to pursue other
inventions. He died three years later, remembered only as the man who
had tried to devise an air- compression-powered tramcar, a brief (very
brief) contender before the advent of electric cable cars. He never
profited by the zip.
This was a common fate among his generation of manic inventors. The
man who exploited Judson's idea was a Swedish immigrant engineer called
Gideon Sundback. In 1913 he secured a patent for a more flexible
fastener than the ill-fated C-Curity. The Plako fastener was an
improvement and it kept the Automatic Hook &amp; Eye Company of Hogoken
afloat as Sundback studiously tinkered and experimented to evolve the
modern zipper, with which he had his first breakthrough in 1917. He
first called it the hookless hooker. It would take another seven years
to catch on and slide smoothly to success. And, fortunately, it was
considered judicious to rename it.
The story of the zip is remarkable because it required such
persistence and dogged faith to make it work. As anyone who has ever
tried to mend one must have concluded, it is the most complicated
engineering solution every applied to such a mundane task. The ingenuity
of Sundback's final design is a marvel. Try describing the modern zip in
words. It is like an inventor's party trick making two miniature stacks
of soup spoons interlock and separate.
A measure of the intricacy is that it took three decades to sort out
the zip. Compare that with the electric light bulb. Within months of
Thomas Edison's 1882 invention a switch was thrown to illuminate
American cities, the La Scala Opera House in Milan and the dining room
of the House of Commons. Against the equally rapid development of the
aeroplane, the telegraph, the telephone, motion pictures and radio, the
zipper jarred and snagged into existence with a reluctance that
infuriated its backers.
It was not until 1923 that the zipper gained its current name and
began its first major promotion. Ironically, given Judson's original
conception, it was introduced as the fastener for a new line of galoshes
launched by the Goodrich Rubber Company, Akron, Ohio. The boots were
called Zippers, but that name would soon stick exclusively to the
fastening device.
The sheer novelty of the zip fastener solved the second problem that
had confronted it for the 30 years of its development. The fact was, and
remains, there is not a single application of the zipper that cannot be
performed adequately by traditional buttons, stays, clasps, laces,
buckles, hooks &amp; eyes, snaps or flaps. But once it became trendy, the
zipper never looked back. It became a style element, synonymous with
modern living, from handbags to corsets, tobacco pouches to aviator
suits. It quickly moved from novelty to necessity. This explains the
strange paradox of the zip, ubiquitous but unnecessary, which Robert
Friedel explores in a fascinating new history of its development*.
When, in the 1930s, that international arbiter of male fashion, Edward
Prince of Wales, adopted zippers, the so-called ''battle of the fly''
was won. The breakthrough in women's fashion came with the zippering of
the collection of Paris couturier Elsa Schiaparelli from 1935. The zip
became an agent of the ''poured-in'' look or the ''pencil-slim'' line.
Zipper production in 1941 topped 500 million in the United States. This
was the decade in which zips became sexy.
SINCE the 1850s the word ''zip'' had been used to denote speed through
the sound registered by a flying bullet. Now there was a new
connotation: speed allied to seduction. The zipper suggested effortless
disrobing, with a hint of mechanised sexuality. The notion survived into
the 1970s when Erica Jong, in the novel Fear of Flying, introduced a
heroine, Isadora, in quest of the ''zipless f***''. ''Zipless because
when you came together zippers fell away like rose petals, underwear
blew off in one breath like dandelion fluff.'' It was sex without guilt,
consequences or power games. And it was ''rarer than the unicorn''.
Unzip a banana, the adverts used to urge, with jovial
disingenuousness, Sticky Fingers warned the Rolling Stones from the
cover of an album sleeve designed by Andy Warhol, featuring a real zip
running down the crotch of Mick Jagger's pants. At suggestive half-mast,
the zipper has always mixed collusive come-on with threat, never more
memorably symbolised than in the zippery network lacerating Marlon
Brando's biker jacket in The Wild One.
''Put a zip on it!'' It is a terse command for silence in more than
one form of English patois. Those who take you for an idiot are abruptly
disabused of the thought that your head is zipped up the back. But zips
down the front, as in the studiedly superfluous accessories worn on
bikini top and briefs by Samantha Fox, register a different message. The
zip makes a dotted line for the eye to scissor along. The journey ends
in zippered eroticism, more than Whitcombe Judson could possibly have
bargained for when he first investigated an easier way to secure his
shoe-laces.

WOMEN prisoners in Scotland will be able to be housed in the same
jails as men from the end of the year.
It will mean short-term convicted women prisoners could serve their
sentences closer to home. Accommodation in halls separate from male
cells at Aberdeen and Inverness prisons and at Dumfries Prison will be
upgraded for women, allowing easier visiting and therefore maintaining
local family.
It will also lead to both sexes being housed at Cornton Vale Women's
Prison near Stirling.
Cornton Vale would effectively become two separate prisons within one
perimeter, with one part used to house low-category young male
offenders.
The changes are aimed at giving women equality of treatment with men.
The details were announced yesterday by Mr Edward Frizzell, chief
executive of the Scottish Prison Service, as he addressed a conference
on women offenders sponsored by the prison reform organisation, Sacro.
Women admitted locally to Dumfries, Aberdeen and Inverness prisons to
start sentences up to and including six months would in future remain
there while women sentenced to between six months and two years would be
given the option of moving to Cornton Vale.
Cornton Vale is also to get a detoxification programme for drug
abusers, involving the use of the heroin substitute methadone on a
reducing basis. Similar programmes are already in place in a number of
male prisons in Scotland.
Women who had responded to the prison survey had identified the need
for a drugs programme. Two out of five said that they had used drugs,
mainly cannabis, at some point in prison in the previous six months,
nine women had admitted injecting and -- of greater concern, he said --
six of these admitted sharing needles.
Post-release programmes lasting several months are also planned. The
limit of one year for women in Cornton Vale to keep their babies is
currently under review, Mr Frizzell said.
The area of greatest tension at Cornton Vale surrounded visits, Mr
Frizzell stated, but he gave a clear warning that staff would continue
to be vigilant to prevent visits being used for the smuggling of drugs.
The SPS, Mr Frizzell said, would also be examining the possibility of
converting a training for freedom hostel outside Polmont Young
Offenders' Institution into a self-contained, pre-release facility for
women prisoners from Cornton Vale, providing a progression for women
nearing the end of their sentence.
It would house up to 16 and allow for outside work placements, giving
women the opportunity of resocialising already accorded to men.
There is also a plan for cognitive training schemes for women at
Cornton Vale, education aimed at teaching offenders to pause and
consider the consequences before acting, to seek other ways of
responding to problems and to consider the impact of their behaviour on
their victims.
The number of women in Scottish prisons has remained constant at
around 3% of the prison population for a decade, he said.

Lady Claire Macdonald rediscovers a traditional taste-sensation from
the garden which combines versatility and tartness
THE first early forced fragile-pink stems of rhubarb were seen by me
for sale in Marks &amp; Spencer before Christmas -- at some price. I can't
remember ever seeing rhubarb for sale so early, but by now we should be
able to buy it much less expensively, and rhubarb is so delicious, and
so versatile, that I like to make the most of it while it is in season.
When you buy rhubarb, the stalks should be stiff -- so that you could
snap them in half. If they feel flabby, the rhubarb is old. It is a very
tart fruit, and needs lots of sweetener as it cooks -- you can use
honey, which not only does the job of sweetening, but also has a flavour
which enhances the rhubarb. If you use sugar, I find soft brown sugar
the nicest.
The thin, pink stalks of rhubarb take scarcely any cooking at all --
the very briefest time. Main-crop rhubarb takes much longer, but don't
be tempted to add any water to the dish, if you bake it, or to the
saucepan (preferably not aluminium) if you are cooking it on top of the
stove. Providing you cook it gently, with the lid on, enough juice will
seep from the rhubarb as it cooks and the sugar or honey dissolves
around it.
Rhubarb is usually associated with pies and crumbles, but there are a
number of more elegant puddings to be made with this fruit. There are
two flavours which seem to be created to go with rhubarb -- orange and
ginger. Just as basil belongs with tomatoes, so, I feel, do orange
and/or ginger go with rhubarb.
Ice-cream made with pureed, cooked rhubarb and with chopped, preserved
ginger is delicious; the same combination makes a good mousse. A rhubarb
meringue-tart is very good if you put ground ginger into the pastry
mixture. And, if you like the combination of rhubarb and orange as much
as I do, whenever you cook rhubarb, add the grated rind of one or two
oranges -- depending on the amount of rhubarb you are cooking -- and the
juice of the oranges.
Just a word about grating oranges -- or lemons, limes, or grapefruit
for that matter.
Many of you will already be aware that all citrus fruits, unless it
states otherwise, are sprayed with a preservative. So wash all the fruit
well before use, if you are going to use the skin or peel in any way.
Rhubarb makes a good sauce to serve with meringues sandwiched together
with whipped cream -- and you can add chopped ginger to the whipped
cream, if you like -- or with baked vanilla-sponge pudding or sliced,
warm flapjacks. This is a good way of using up the tough, elderly stalks
of rhubarb as the season wears on.
For a puree which is to be served as a sauce, you do need a velvety
smoothness, and this usually means sieving the puree. Whether you think
this is necessary depends on you -- and the sharpness of the blades on
your processor or liquidiser! Rhubarb freezes extremely well either cut
in chunks or made into a puree for serving as a sauce. You could then
use the puree as the basis for mousse or ice-cream. As a sorbet --
rhubarb and ginger sorbet is both refreshing and delicious, for example.
The recipe today is for a set rhubarb puree, called a suedoise. You
can make a suedoise from any type of fruit, but should you use a soft,
summer fruit -- instead of rhubarb, in coming months -- and sharpen up
the flavour with lemon juice. There is no need to sharpen up the flavour
of rhubarb, it is quite acidic enough! But it does make an ideal pud,
served, as I suggest, with ginger cream and small ginger-meringues.
You can make the suedoise either in a pudding-bowl or in a loaf-tin.
Either looks attractive covered with the cream and studded with the
meringues. The suedoise can be made a couple of days in advance, and the
meringues can be made and stored in an airtight container, so all you
need to do is to turn out the suedoise and assemble it with cream and
meringues on a serving-plate.
Serves 6-8
* For the suedoise:
2lbs (800g) rhubarb, weighed when trimmed and cut into chunks
pared rind of 1 orange
juice of 1 orange
5-6oz (125g-150g) soft brown sugar
2 sachets of gelatine (1oz/25g) or 8 leaves of gelatine
* For the meringue:
2 egg whites
4oz (100g) caster sugar
1 teaspoon powdered ginger
* For the ginger cream:
[1/2] pint (250ml) double cream, whipped fairly stiffly
5-6 pieces preserved ginger, drained and chopped
FIRST make the meringues. Line a baking tray with a sheet of baking
parchment. In a clean bowl whisk the egg-whites till they are stiff,
then add the sugar, a spoonful at a time, whisking continuously till the
sugar is all used up and you have a stiff meringue. With a metal spoon,
fold in the powdered ginger quickly. Pipe the mixture, using a
star-shaped nozzle, into even-sized small meringues, about the size of a
10p. Bake in a low oven 225F, gas mark mark [1/2], 100C for 1[1/2]-2
hours. The meringues should lift easily off the paper when they are
cooked.
MAKE the suedoise by putting the chunks of rhubarb in a non-aluminium
saucepan with the orange rind, its juice and the sugar. Over a gentle
heat, with the lid on the pan, cook till the sugar dissolves and the
rhubarb chunks are quite soft. Then either feed in the gelatine leaves
or sprinkle in the powdered gelatine and stir till it dissolves.
Liquidise and then sieve the puree into either a loaf-tin (a 2-3lb tin)
or a pudding-bowl, but whichever you use rinse it out in cold water
before you pour in the puree. Leave to set, preferably overnight. Dip
the tin briefly in warm water to turn on to a serving plate. Spread the
whipped cream over the surface -- this will be easier a few minutes
after you have turned out the suedoise -- then cover with chopped
ginger, pressing it into the cream, and stud with meringues.

Research which promised to be mostly about figures has provided some
amazing facts about the restoration of Iona Abbey, Lorn Macintyre
reveals
WHEN I saw the 200 boxes locked away behind a grille in St Andrews
University Library I hesitated about taking on the commission to write
the biography of Sir David Russell, proprietor of the Fife paper mills,
Tullis Russell. They would be mostly dull business papers, I thought.
But when I asked for one of the boxes marked Iona, and read letters
from Lord George MacLeod that his biographer Ron Ferguson had not had
access to, I wrote that night to accept the commission.
MacLeod is credited with the idea of restoring Iona Abbey, but the
unpublished Russell papers tell a different story -- and a story that
needs to be made public.
David Russell was a brilliant but shy man who used his wealth to
create one of the most technically advanced paper mills in Europe, and
to expand his mind. In the 1920s he built workers' houses complete with
the most modern conveniences, including electric irons, and he
established a Sunlight Clinic at the mills for debilitated employees.
Russell bought a house on Iona in the 1930s. He had long dreamed of
the restoration of the monastic ruins and in 1931 commissioned Reginald
Fairlie to prepare plans. But there was a race on to rebuild the ruins.
The American Iona Society wanted to establish a Celtic university,
restoring the monastic ruins on Iona as a campus. Another contender was
the Rev George MacLeod, with a scheme for a ''Community settlement''.
MacLeod prepared a confidential memorandum: ''Since the public press
notices regarding the Celtic College on the mainland with its 'spiritual
centre' still in Iona, I have had a talk with Mr Angus Robertson, the
Inspirer of the whole project. While of course I cannot speak for him,
nor could he speak for the American Iona Society, it is worth saying,
unofficially, that he appeared to look on such a scheme as outlined
above as in no way antithetical to his conceived purposes but
complementary to them.''
I came across another name that has never featured in the history of
the restoration of the Iona ruins. Clare Vyner, of the Northampton
family who had Torloisk estate on Mull, was owner of Fountains Abbey
near Ripon in Yorkshire, said to be the finest monastic ruin in Britain.
Having viewed Fairlie's plans, Vyner went to see the architect. Vyner
suggested that the Iona ruins could be restored and used as a centre for
social work in the Western Isles.
An intrigued Russell received a copy of the Vyner scheme. ''The
training would be definitely undenominational . . . but there would
naturally be a certain amount of theological study, as it is essential
that the two should be linked together.
''The major portion of their training should be to enable them when
they leave Iona to be useful servants to the people amongst whom they
are going to work. On completing their time on Iona, these students or
'missionaries' would be appointed to different parishes.''
George MacLeod wrote to Russell from his Govan parish in November
1936: ''Thank you for sending me the Vyner papers. I am frankly not
impressed with the picture. Undenominational Social Service has had its
days. I intend this early spring to make up my mind finally whether I am
'in on' an experiment beginning at Iona. If I am, I shall claim that it
will be of firmer stuff than this spreading of arts and crafts to the
(largely denuded) Western Isles.
''I shall go for Fifty Thousand Pounds right away, if not from one man
(there are latent Nuffields north of the Border) then from no more than
five.
''If I am not on, then it is no concern of mine what happens to the
buildings; but I would privately prognosticate dereliction for a vaguely
Christian Social Scheme in those stern walls. I rather think the very
stones would cry out.''
But MacLeod must have been attracted to at least part of Vyner's plan,
because they met in Govan, with the object of drawing up a scheme for
submission to the Iona Cathedral Trustees.
Following the meeting, Vyner reported to David Russell: ''The major
issue 'Iona' seems to be very much in MacLeod's hands. His idea of
making it a setting-off place for a pilgrimage of national scope may be
excellent. If he goes ahead with his idea, it will be a very alive
business and obviously is a concrete scheme and as such is probably the
one to hope for.''
In the Russell archive I discovered that the Marquis of Bute tried to
buy Iona from the Duke of Argyll in early 1938. Though the sacred
buildings and sites would be excluded from such a sale, there was alarm
that Iona might be turned into a Catholic seminary.
But MacLeod was already moving on his ''Community'' scheme, using
Russell's plans for the restoration of the Iona buildings. MacLeod wrote
to the richest man he knew, Sir James Lithgow, the Clyde shipbuilder,
whose yacht came into Iona in the summer.
MacLeod asked him for #5000. The battleship builder invited MacLeod to
spend the night, and put a proposition to him. ''If I give you #5000,
will you give up your pacifism?'' MacLeod replied: 'Not on your life!''
He got his money anyway. Russell wrote a private memorandum on the
modern saga of Iona for his private archive.
* Sir David Russell -- A Biography was published yesterday by
Canongate at #14.99.

THE retiring deputy chief executive of the Scottish Prison Service,
who quit only yesterday, has been headhunted by the service's English
counterpart to become its joint number two.
Mr Alan Walker, 56, is to start next month as operational director in
charge of 59 prisons in the southern half of England. His appointment --
approved by the English prisons Minister, Mr Michael Forsyth, and Home
Secretary Michael Howard -- is a slap in the face for the English
prisons hierarchy.
It is also a notable feather in the cap of the Prison Service in
Scotland, and a recognition of the operational stability which has been
achieved here, in contrast to the headline-grabbing chaos south of the
Border.
When his decision to retire after 25 years in the Scottish service was
made public by The Herald a few months ago, a number of jobs were known
to be on offer to Mr Walker.
His salary is likely to be close to the #83,000 ceiling for the job.

Margaret Hughes discovers once again that most restaurants are not
always what they seem
WORD of mouth is important in any business; in the restaurant business
it is crucial to the success or failure of a new venture. I have
recently been inundated with advice on where I should eat and why.
People have also taken a great deal of pleasure in telling me about
awful service, terrible food, astronomical prices, and restaurants which
I should definitely avoid.
For the most part I do not join in, preferring to find out for myself
just how good or bad somewhere is, and I rarely base an eating-out
decision on a tall tale told after several bottles of wine and hazy
memories of just what people have eaten.
However, I am not immune to the criticism or praise which is heaped on
restaurants. One name which has cropped up time and again over the past
few weeks is The Big Blue. Comments ranged from how brilliant the decor
is, to how enjoyable the food is, and how laid-back and trendy it is. My
curiosity was aroused -- those recommending it are serious eaters, whose
judgment I trust. I went along ready to be dazzled.
The Big Blue is easy to miss on Glasgow's Great Western Road. I drove
by it twice. Closer inspection of a big sign in a small window
eventually revealed that this was the right place.
The name of the restaurant had suggested two things to me, first that
the menu would be heavily biased towards fish and seafood and, secondly,
that the music would be cool jazz. As I descended the stairs in the
restaurant the interior design was simple and appealing; the white walls
decorated with mosaics of brilliant blue implied a descent into the
ocean.
On reaching the restaurant the first thing which hits you is the
darkness; it takes a few minutes for your eyes to adjust to the moody,
smoky light. And rather than the laid-back ambience of a trendy jazz
joint, the atmosphere is frenetic and filled with very loud pop music.
The Big Blue is trendy, students in outlandish outfits jostle for
position with men in Italian suits, while women in little black numbers
dangle fake Chanel bags over their shoulders.
I do not usually like trendy joints, I always feel their life is so
ephemeral and that their whole existence relies too much on the whims of
people ready to change their allegiance at the drop of a hemline.
Restaurants need loyal customers, committed, ''untrendy'' people like
me, who do not care what is ''in'', but do care what is good.
The Big Blue is a bar and restaurant combined. The bar area was
crowded and tables were scarce in the restaurant, which is quite small
and a little too cramped. However, the waiting staff move around the
tables nimbly and seem very happy to be there.
The menu in the restaurant is not extensive. Starters are limited, the
bruschetta sounded tempting, the spicy grilled chicken wings just
sounded too predictable, so I decided on the minestrone soup. It was
disappointing. The stock lacked flavour and the vegetables were too
finely chopped. It was not at all the hearty broth that one expects from
minestrone soup.
Main courses include several pasta dishes, from a simple penne al
pomodoro e basilico, a tomato and basil sauce, to the more exotic
spaghetti allo scoglio, a mix of fish, shellfish, chillies, and
tomatoes. I had psyched myself up for some fish, but the only offering
was blackened redfish cooked in Cajun spices. Most other people were
eating pasta, and appeared to be enjoying it. I wanted something a bit
more substantial than pasta and chose pollo alla crema, which is chicken
cooked in a creamy sauce with mushrooms and served with rice.
The chicken breast was succulent, but the sauce was bland, although a
more than liberal sprinkling of pepper did give it some character. There
were many mushrooms but these had failed to impart any of their flavour
to the sauce, which really just tasted like cream. In the dim light it
was also difficult to distinguish the colour of anything.
However, the dish was saved by the fresh salad of lollo rosso,
peppers, tomatoes, and onions. This would have been better served on a
side plate, rather than on the same plate as the main course, where it
swam in the creamy sauce.
The dessert menu is limited to crepes with a variety of fillings, such
as sugar and lemon or Grand Marnier, chocolate fudge cake and ice-cream.
I chose the chocolate-filled crepe. The waiter advised that because the
crepes are freshly made it would take around 10 minutes before it was
served. I was very optimistic that it would arrive at the table piping
hot and covered in a rich, velvety chocolate sauce. The crepe was indeed
well cooked, but it was nowhere near the exceptionally good ones which
vendors sell on Parisian streets.
The chocolate sauce was runny and cloying and shone brilliantly in the
dim light. I would say this was chocolate of a poor quality that had
been melted and dribbled over the crepe. After only one mouthful I
needed several gulps of water. I then scraped away the remaining
chocolate and attempted to enjoy the rest of the crepe.
Not surprisingly, the wine-list is quite small. Whites include
Frascati Superiore and Orvieto. There are flasks of Chianti for those
who prefer red, as well as Settesoli and Barolo.
The biggest attraction of The Big Blue is the atmosphere -- it is a
noisy, bustling restaurant where tables are turned around quickly, but
where the staff are friendly, service is good, and the clientele is
mixed.
The Big Blue is an audacious, fun restaurant, it is a place which
people will naturally talk about and recommend to friends. Not because
the food is wonderful, but because it's the sort of place where you can
meet lots of friends and make lots of noise. The trendy element might
well move on, but I suspect The Big Blue will gain its fair shore of
devotees to enjoy its reasonably priced food and seriously friendly
atmosphere.
* The Big Blue, 445 Great Western Road, Glasgow, is open seven days a
week, and food is served until 8.30pm. Three courses plus wine cost
around #15.
The Abbot's Inch, Arkleston Road, Renfrew. Tel: 0141 886 4988.
THE Abbot's Inch is a bar and restaurant on the boundary where Renfrew
meets Paisley. From the outside it does look inviting. However, it is an
appealing mix of wood and stained-glass.
Lunch in the pub consists of the basic staples of soup, sandwiches,
and baked potatoes and is reasonably priced.
The restaurant offers a slightly more formal setting and a menu that
includes starters such as melon, soup, and gravadlax -- a huge portion
of very good smoked salmon.
Main courses are far more interesting and include venison, salmon, and
chicken dishes. The smoked haddock is served with poached egg and is
very filling. The vegetarian option is pasta in a tomato sauce and is
simple but satisfying.
Desserts include a sumptuous apple pie, deliciously sweet caramel
mousse, and rich, steamed gingerbread pudding and custard.
* The Abbot's Inch is open seven days a week and food is served all
day. Lunch at the pub costs around #5, including coffee. The table
d'hote menu in the restaurant offers two courses plus coffee for #7.95,
or three courses plus coffee for #9.95.

HOLLYWOOD MOVIE STILLS
Joel W Finler
Batsford, #15.99
THEY may be called moving pictures, but often it is the still picture
that is remembered long after the moving ones have been consigned to
oblivion. Stills are not simply frames lifted from the film. The
photographs, taken by special cameramen for publicity purposes,
sometimes recreate a moment from the film, sometimes show it being made,
sometimes illustrate what the audience should expect without actually
giving anything away.
Charles Laughton, for instance, is never seen full face in publicity
stills from The Hunchback of Notre Dame because the makers did not wish
to reveal the secret of his makeup. For Hitchcock's Psycho, although
today we know that Norman Bates did it, the publicity stills of the time
keep the secret and show Anthony Perkins expressing fear as well as John
Gavin, Vera Miles and Janet Leigh.
Sometimes Finler gives the game away, showing, for instance, how a
shot of Sydney Poitier and Rod Steiger from In the Heat of the Night was
taken. They are looking down at a man working underneath a car and, to
get the point of view of the man being spoken to, are placed on a small
rostrum. Finler gives the film's version and the production still,
which, as well as making the stars look slightly ridiculous, is a mine
of information about the film making process.
There are stills taken of people long before they became stars, but in
which the elusive star quality shines through. Finler points out in one
of the young Betty Grable dancing in a party scene that somehow she
manages to take the thing over from the long forgotten leading lady.
There are stills of people meeting the real person they played in some
biopic. The young Natalie Wood with the real Gypsy Rose Lee looks good
casting, but Rosalind Russell and Sister Kenny make a bizarre pairing.
And there are stills of stars at home -- Cary Grant and Randolph Scott
sharing the kitchen chores is one of those pictures that speaks a
thousand words.
It is a lovely book, one to dip into, to return to, the perfect
companion to all those marvellous movies, and a reminder of a near
forgotten craft because today's stills are poor things by comparison.

ASTONISHING THE GODS
Ben Okri
Phoenix House, #12
THIS is a wonderfully mysterious book which I read at a sitting and
look forward to reading again. On one level Okri's intentions are clear.
But just when we imagine we have grasped his meaning, or understood the
book's agenda another facet is revealed. It is textured between
consciousness and memory. Has a search for identity at its core. And
concerns a faceless, nameless narrator who is burdened by immortality.
It is a progression of paradoxes, and the first is declared at the
very beginning: ''He was born invisible. His mother was invisible too,
and that was why she could see him.'' Though he wants to be a shepherd,
he is condemned to find ''the secret of invisibility,'' having
discovered he is invisible by reading books. He searched for mention of
himself and his people. ''And discovered to his youthful astonishment
that he didn't exist.''
Okri's problem of how to approach his subject without resorting to
meaningless abstraction or definition is partly solved by his use of the
initial paradox, followed by a succession of paradoxes, which brings him
dangerously close to cliche.
Were we to take his fable literally -- as with, say, the later works
of Flaubert or Tolstoy -- it would hardly convince us of anything other
than Okri's imaginative potency or his skills as a fabulist. By turning
invisibility into a metaphor for poverty, and coupling this with his
belief that innocence is the purest state of knowledge, he converts the
narrator's journey, and its paradoxes into a way of learning and
unlearning our own layers of knowledge.
The narrator proceeds by learning to love the paradoxes, by accepting
the fusion of opposites, by following his own rhythm and believing in
his own discoveries.
''The world was telling him to stop looking and then he would see
beyond; to stop thinking then he would comprehend; to stop trying to
make sense of things, for then he would find the truest grace.''
Okri's position is unique in contemporary literature. His third novel,
The Famished Road, won the Booker Prize in 1991. But his work is as far
removed from the mainstream of British literary fiction as it is
possible to be, making a nonsense of convenient classifications. He
seems to be writing from a deeper, communal source, giving voice and
articulation to a collective literature, where he is part of a community
whose everyday life he re-interprets for the benefit of successive
generations, recording rites and values as naturally as the events
themselves using imagination and fable as a means of discovery rather
than invention.
In the end it is the narrative itself, the simple self-conscious act
of storytelling which produces the dignity, richness and potential, the
means of transferring from invisibility to substance. For Okri offers a
hopeful new belief system, where present trends and values are inverted,
where opposites are fused to produce a world where hospitals are filled
with healthy people and money is redundant, where everyone is ''building
a great new future in invisible space''.
His achievement is to make the impossible seem possible and to
articulate what has often been regarded as shapeless or unworthy, or has
simply been ignored. His continuing refusal to compromise, to
persistently fuse realism with fantasy and to make them interchangeable
has created a work of simple power and dignity, which re-affirms the
triumph of the imagination and strength of the invisible peoples whose
life and culture is unrecorded and ignored, whose response is silence.

While most of us get ready to indulge our mothers tomorrow - after
all, it's only for one day of the year - KIRSTY SCOTT looks at the
plight of children forced to survive on the streets without any parental
support
THE YOUNG boy who was being interviewed by social workers on the
streets of Nairobi refused, despite repeated requests, to put down his
only possession -- an old hessian sack. ''This is not a sack,'' he
finally told them. ''It is my father and mother, my house, my car, and
my daily bread. I can't steal without it.''
His response has become a kind of mantra for the Undugu Society of
Kenya, which works among the juvenile flotsam and jetsam on the streets
of the country's capital.
Undugu was set up by a handful of volunteers 22 years ago to deal with
the small number of young boys who had taken up residence on the city
streets and who made money by parking cars for tourists and shoppers.
They now cope with around 3000 children who have been driven into the
city centre by poverty, family disintegration, ethnic clashes, and a
series of disastrous economic policies which have marginalised those at
the bottom of the social scale.
World-wide it is estimated that there are more than 30 million
children living by their wits on city streets. In Sao Paulo, Brazil,
there are some 500,000 street children, in Calcutta there are 300,000,
in Kenya 500,000, and in Nairobi, around 30,000.
Aloys Opiyo, Undugu Society executive director, is in Scotland this
week to visit the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund, which
contributes to the programme, and to discuss children and poverty in a
global context.
The society's principal activities are education and training, and
they run a variety of centres where youngsters can be taught social and
professional skills. They are also working on preventative measures,
such as setting up development projects in Nairobi's three worst slums
to try to stop the children moving away in the first place.
In the past two decades they have managed to help 5000 children find a
different life away from the streets. It is a grim existence for the
youngsters and an arduous task for the volunteers.
''You can find some as young as six or seven among the children on the
streets,'' said Opiyo. ''They face violence from the police, violence
from older children, sexually transmitted diseases, rape, addictions,
glue-sniffing. They also develop a hard-core attitude to authority and
ultimately they can become robbers.''
Every Monday night between 6pm and 9pm social workers from Undugu
scour the alleys and back streets of Nairobi, looking for the chuoms,
the small groups of children who have banded together for security and
companionship.
When they find them they try to develop a rapport and persuade as many
as possible to join their programme and choose an alternative lifestyle.
''It is easy to persuade them to join us if they have been on the
streets for a year or less. If they have been on the streets for more
than three years it's very hard. It's a lifestyle for them and it makes
you hardened in your heart,'' said Opiyo, tapping his chest.
''Two-thirds of the time they are drunk or sniffing glue.''
Until the 1980s the street children were overwhelmingly boys, but in
the early 80s Undugu started to notice an influx of young girls. It is
thought that the breakdown of traditional African values, which normally
see young girls at home helping their mothers, is partly to blame.
Sexual exploitation of the girls is rampant. They can become caught in
a web of prostitution or be passed around the male members of their
chuom. There is a high rate of sexually transmitted diseases, including
HIV, and many of the girls display severe psychological trauma from the
sexual abuse they have suffered.
''You find girls of about nine years old out for commercial sex,''
said Opiyo. ''It's the worst form of child abuse. We never used to have
girls on the streets until the 1980s, now many girls are going out
there. It's a phenomenon which is really disturbing.''
Opiyo said Kenya's dispossessed youngsters don't face the same level
of public hostility as their counterparts in South America, but violence
against the street kids has been increasing. They can also be rounded up
if city officials want the streets clear for a major conference.
''Recently a child was shot by a police reservist. The argument was
that the child was challenging him. Some children have been killed and
the killers claim they were violent, so people begin to stigmatise them
as thieves and troublemakers. When there is a big conference, sometimes
they are arrested and kept in police stations or remand centres. The
media also sometimes portray these children as dangerous criminals,
which makes society become hostile.''
Opiyo and his colleagues have been trying to educate the public about
the street kids programme and the basic rights which the children should
be able to enjoy.
They have had numerous successes, with children going on to university
or setting up their own businesses and offering jobs to those coming
along behind them. Many are married with their own families.
He is wary of aid agencies who hope to try to tackle the problem by
dropping in and offering feeding programmes. The children will eat and
then disappear back on to the streets.
''We believe strongly in one thing. Any rehabilitation programme which
is not anchored in education and training is futile. It's a long-term
commitment.''
Opiyo would like to see that commitment applied in Scotland and
anywhere else across the globe where there are children living in
poverty. It is naive to believe the problem exists only in Africa and
other developing nations, he said.
''In Scotland there are some pockets of suffering and poverty. Where
there is suffering, whether in Scotland or Kenya, you must give hope. I
remember visiting a centre for the homeless here in Glasgow two years
ago and speaking to some of the children who, I think, were a little bit
drunk.
''The problems of poverty in the world are the same. If you are poor
in England or Bangladesh, it's poverty, it's the same thing. By looking
at your own situation you are able to respond intelligently to problems
elsewhere, but I think it is human to see the problems elsewhere
first.''

* TO WRITE a novel about death and mortality and call it The Anatomy
Lesson (Abacus, #8.99) when Philip Roth has already addressed the same
subject under the same title, demands a certain degree of chutzpah. But
when it's also a confessional novel told by an expatriate in Amsterdam,
and its key is an Old Master painting -- thus inviting comparisons with
Albert Camus's The Fall -- then the author really is cruising for a
bruising.
Without these accidental or deliberate allusions, John David Morley's
cool-toned tale of two young American brothers (apparently well-adjusted
elder genius versus aimless hippie waster) would stand up well enough.
But in the Roth/Camus heavyweight division, a merely skilful exploration
of sibling rivalry and juvenile nihilism is keeping dangerous company,
especially when the narrator's stoned indifference is so well
transmitted to the reader.
Those who have survived the long wait for the follow-up to Henry
Roth's brilliant debut Call It Sleep will not be disappointed in The
Mercy Of A Rude Stream: A Star Shines Over Mount Morris Park (Phoenix,
#5.99). Covering the same working-class, New York-Jewish ground as Call
It Sleep, this exhilarating and frankly autobiographical human drama,
teeming with life and memory and a little touch of schmaltz, proves that
there is life in the family novel yet. However, this first volume of a
projected longer work takes Roth's young alter-ego Ira Stigman only from
the beginning of the First World War to the early days of Prohibition;
so Roth had better get his skates on before he and his readers die of
old age.
The cover blurb ''Already as acclaimed as Sylvia Plath's The Bell
Jar'' does not -- there is nothing remotely romantic about insanity --
predispose one kindly to Susanna Kaysen's teenage mental-hospital memoir
Girl, Interrupted (Virago, #8.99). The story of two years (1967-69) in a
private asylum in Massachusetts, brought on by a combination of genuine
distress and wilful adolescent angst, is told with wry humour and an
agreeable lack of self-pity, but the parallels claimed with One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest are vitiated by the acknowledgement that the
author would have been released -- nay, evicted -- the moment her
parents stopped paying the fees of $60 a day.
Randle P MacMurphy never had it this easy; and a comparison of
Kaysen's book with Ken Kesey's demonstrates precisely the difference
between tourism and residence in the country of madness.
There are plenty of people madder than Susanna Kaysen ever was in
Bridget O'Connor's story collection Here Comes John (Picador, #5.99),
but they're not locked up. Tales of tough girls doing what's needed to
get by in the London lowlife, they have a cynical wit and a ruthlessness
about the war of the sexes that occasionally collapses to reveal a
tenderness and pity for their characters' twitchy, precarious lives. One
to watch.

VAGABOND OF VERSE:
Robert Service: A Biography
James Mackay
Mainstream, #20
THOUGH he wrote some of the most popular poems of the twentieth
century -- slim volume Songs of a Sourdough (1907) was a massive
bestseller -- Robert Service belittled his work and for too long
literary authorities have authorised his opinion. Critics continue to be
unkind to him: The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English (1993)
mentions ''melodramatic verse . . . of comparatively little literary
merit'', The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry (1994) ignores
Service altogether.
It is about time serious questions were asked and answered about
Service. Did he, for example, write ''Eskimo Nell''? If he did, he was
an outstanding poet for that ballad, with its intricate internal rhymes
and thrusting rhythms, is the work of a master. In appreciation of its
brilliance, the common reader has attributed it, quite mistakenly, to
Noel Coward, commonly called The Mater. But ''Eskimo Nell'' sounds more
like Service than Coward.
It sounds like ''The Shooting of Dan McGrew'' which Service included
in Songs of a Sourdough as he rushed for gold in volumes of verse that
made him, as James Mackay observes, ''in fact . . . the most successful
poet of the twentieth century in material terms''. While Service got
cash for Dan McGrew and Sam McGee and other characters he got no credit
for Eskimo Nell as she was too hot for any respectable man to handle in
the days before Lady Chatterley liberated the literary world.
For all his research into Service, Mackay cannot make up his mind
about the authorship of ''Eskimo Nell''. Judging on internal evidence, I
am certain Service created Nell but could not risk his reputation by
associating himself with a whore of a modern heroine. Similarly, Auden
never came clean about writing ''A Platonic Blow'' because it was known
as a dirty poem.
Service was more complex than the characters he created. Born in
Preston and brought up in Kilwinning then Glasgow, where he served seven
years as a bank clerk before emigrating to Canada, Service turned his
talent to profitable use in poems and ballads that earned him fame and
the name of the Canadian Kipling. We get a better measure of the man by
thinking of him as the Scottish Swinburne. Like Swinburne, Service could
coin memorable cliches for our linguistic currency.
When he wasn't writing sexual poems for his own satisfaction,
Swinburne wrote like this: ''From too much love of living,/From hope and
fear set free,/We thank with brief thanksgiving/Whatever gods may
be/That no life lives for ever,/That dead men rise up never;/That even
the weariest river/Winds somewhere safe to sea.''
When he wasn't under the spell of Eskimo Nell, Service wrote something
like that about the Spell of the Yukon: ''There's a land where the
mountains are nameless,/And the rivers all run God knows where;/There
are lives that are erring and aimless,/And deaths that just hang by a
hair.'' Service never acknowledged his Swinburnean aesthetic as he
projected himself as a literary lout.
Service claimed a connection with Burns who was also coy about his
crude poems. In his imaginative autobiography, Ploughman of the Moon
(1945), Service suggested his great-grandfather had boozed with Burns
though Mackay, who questions chronology according to Service, considers
that a likely story. So much speculation.
Mackay is not above speculating on his subject: ''It is interesting to
speculate on whether Service and Hemingway met. If they did, then both
kept silent on the matter.'' Service seems to have kept silent on many
matters. Mackay calls his subject ''one of the literary enigmas of our
time'' but feels he has the facts Service concealed in Ploughman of the
Moon and biographers Carl Klinck (1976) and Wallace Lockhart (1991)
failed to reveal. At least Mackay knows his Scotland and ridicules
Klinck for thinking Kilwinning, the Long Grey Town of Service's early
upbringing, was a Highland home.
Mackay knows his Kilwinning, knows Service survived the enforced piety
of the place before moving to Glasgow where he established himself as
''a street tough'' before becoming a banker in 1888: ''In fact the bank
was the Stobcross branch of the Commercial Bank of Scotland.'' He knows
Service told lies about his life when he dated his departure to Canada
to 1895: ''In fact, his resignation from the Commercial Bank took effect
on 31 March 1896.'' Mackay is keen to face the facts: ''In fact, the
first ship of the season was due to leave the Clyde on 15 April
[1896]''; ''the ship was, in fact, the SS Concordia''.
The facts of a literary life are not enough to explain the artistry
of an author. Mackay is an excellent chronicler of Service's life in
England, Scotland, Canada and France and accounts for the career of a
banker and poetic professional by fanfaring his own parade of acts: ''In
fact, it is probable that [Service] would enjoy a higher literary
standing today had he rested on his laurels.'' Fact is, no restlessly
creative individual can rest on his laurels.
Mackay's biography is constructed as a contradiction of Service's
autobiography. Whatever Service said, Mackay says the opposite. Service
said he composed Songs of a Sourdough in a couple of months, Mackay says
he took years to complete his classic. This is a fascinating book for
those who want the facts as avoided by Service and asserted by Mackay.
The facts of a life of Service summed up by Mackay as the career of a
''wiry little Scotsman'' who was ''in essence, a poet in the literal
sense''.
I believe Service was more a poet in the literary sense of being a
believer in the larger life that lies beyond facts. I believe he came
alive when, in fact, he stopped counting his cash and, in fantasy, fell
in love with ladies known as Lou or Eskimo Nell.

A DECISION on miscarriage of justice appeals by Scotland's senior
judge was swept aside yesterday by five of his colleagues.
They said that not only had Lord Justice-General Hope wrongly
interpreted the law, he had flown in the face of his own previous
decisions and failed to follow established High Court procedures.
In the Court of Criminal Appeal yesterday, Lord Ross, the Lord
Justice-Clerk, made clear his view that it was not competent for judges
to modify the language of an Act of Parliament to bring it into line
with their own views of what was right or reasonable.
The judge said he was aware that in recent years there had been
criticism of the approach taken by the court in cases where the
existence of additional evidence not heard at the trial was alleged to
have led to a miscarriage of justice.
He pointed out, however, that since the passing of the Criminal
Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 ''it is Parliament and not the court which
has imposed restrictions upon the leading of additional evidence in such
circumstances''.
The position was now being reviewed by the Government and the
Sutherland Committee, of which Lord Ross is a member, was currently
looking at the question of appeals and miscarriages of justice.
It might be that the committee would propose changes in the law, but
unless and until it did, the court had to apply the law as it stood.
The current split in the ranks of the court has arisen over the
decision last month by Lord Hope, supported by Lords Allanbridge and
Brand, in the case of Alan Church.
Church was jailed for eight years for a building society robbery in
Glasgow but has now produced video-enhancement evidence which he says
casts doubt on his conviction.
Lord Hope accepted that this evidence was available at the trial and
could reasonably have been made available, and under the law as it had
been understood since 1980, that would have been fatal to Church's case.
However, the court agreed to allow the ''new'' evidence on the basis
that Church had given a ''reasonable explanation'' for failing to
produce it at his trial.
The following week, in the case of Angus Elliott, jailed for life at
the High Court in Kirkcaldy last year for murdering his policewoman
girlfriend, Lord Ross cast serious doubt on the decision in Church and
it was agreed to test the law before five judges.
Yesterday, in a 48-page opinion, Lord Ross said the law on fresh
evidence cases was contained in section 228(2) of the Criminal Procedure
(Scotland) Act and had been considered in a number of earlier cases.
The Act allowed a review of any alleged miscarriage of justice on the
basis of additional evidence not heard at the trial, not available, and
which could not reasonably have been made available.
In the Church case the court had allowed the new evidence although it
failed the stringent test laid down in the Act.
Lord Ross added: ''In so holding, the court in Church were disagreeing
with the law as laid down in a number of cases. In these circumstances,
with all respect to the judges who sat in Church, I am of the opinion
that that case itself should have been remitted to a full bench.''
It was well-established in the High Court that a bench of three was
bound by an earlier decision by an equal number of judges.
Lord Ross referred to the case of Salusbury-Hughes in 1987 in which he
himself had said: ''To be the basis of an alleged miscarriage of justice
it must be shown that the additional evidence which was not heard at the
trial and was not available could not reasonably have been made
available.''
In his opinion that was the plain import of the language used by
Parliament.
The judge then outlined a series of cases in which that test had been
followed by appeal judges.
He said: ''It will be observed that all three judges in Church have
been members of courts which have in the past supported the construction
set out in Salusbury-Hughes.
''With all respect to these judges, they do not appear to have
explained in Church why they they have altered the views which they
previously expressed.''
He did not understand how they had come to accept a ''reasonable
explanation'' for having failed to lead evidence at Church's trial when
Parliament had laid down a more exacting test.
The four other judges -- Lords McCluskey, Morison, Morton, and Cowie
-- joined him in disapproving of and over-ruling the decision in Church.
They also decided to reject Elliott's attempt to lead fresh
psychiatric evidence.
They said it could have been led at the trial and, in any event, fell
far short of supporting a plea of diminished responsibility.
Despite yesterday's decision, Church's appeal will go ahead because a
ruling has already been made in his favour, even although it has now
turned out to be wrong.

PRINCESS Margaret visited East Kilbride yesterday to open the Inland
Revenue's Centre 1 building -- for the second time.
It is almost 27 years since she opened the first building, but it
leaked so much that a new one had to be constructed.
Located two miles from the previous building, the #24m centre
accommodates 1600 staff and includes a restaurant, creche, and keep-fit
facilities.
Princess Margaret's tour of the building included the post room, where
25,000 items of mail are dealt with every week, and the creche where she
was presented with a posy by three-year-old Jamie Crichton whose mother,
Lesley, is a typist at the centre.
Later, Sir Anthony Battishill, the chairman of the board of the Inland
Revenue, said: ''We are committed to providing a quality service to all
employers and employees in Scotland and good working conditions for our
staff. This fine building will ensure that we do both.''
Centre 1 deals with all the 2.2m PAYE taxpayers who work for employers
based in Scotland. When staff moved into the new building in January, it
took 14 removal vans and 18,000 crates to shift all the files.
The previous building, a typical 1960s tower block, 19 storeys high,
faced the prevailing wind and as a result suffered from building defects
mainly caused by leaks. It was deemed too costly to repair.
This time, as the Inland Revenue cheerfully points out: ''all the
water features are on the outside'', for the landscaping around the
centre includes a pond and a weir -- and you thought the taxman didn't
have a sense of humour.

Professor George Browning describes the impact on his life after being
diagnosed as HIV positive
FROM the outside it was easy to imagine that George Browning's world
fell apart in the last few days before Christmas when he was diagnosed
as being HIV positive.
For days he was in the eye of a hurricane of publicity as former
patients called a health board helpline to discover the implications for
themselves.
Shattered by the diagnosis, and ill with pneumonia, he had to break
the news to his wife, Annette. He told his three children on Christmas
Eve with half-an-hour to spare before his identity was broadcast to the
world.
As he contemplated his return to work in the ear, nose, and throat
departments at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and Gartnavel General Hospital,
Professor Browning yesterday looked tanned and perky after a
recuperative holiday with friends in South Africa.
''I am feeling very well,'' he said, a slightly drawn appearance and
occasional hoarse quiver in his voice the only clue to the ordeal of the
past three months.
It had been a different picture towards the end of last year, when he
went to see his GP with chest problems and was referred to a specialist
at the Royal.
''Because of the nature of the infection, and what they saw on the
X-rays, they suggested a test for HIV -- it wasn't that I went along
thinking I had HIV,'' he said.
The diagnosis had major implications not only for him but for Greater
Glasgow Health Board, which had to execute swiftly the measures laid
down for dealing with the emergence of HIV in a health worker.
That meant hurried preparations to man a helpline over Christmas, and
a press conference on Christmas Eve to announce the fact. Professor
Browning was entitled to remain anonymous, but he said yesterday: ''On
the previous evening I had made up my mind to suggest that my
confidentiality was not important when taken against the needs of my
patients.
''I came into the open because I thought it was the right thing to do,
and I do not regret it. I still think it was the right thing to do.
''The fact that I have received so much support and that no-one has
been negative about it suggests I did the right thing. There is no
reason to suggest anyone else should not do the same, but obviously
people's individual personalities may make it different. There is no one
right solution.
''I think simply having a named individual allows the number of people
who are going to be concerned to be reduced considerably. Much more
important is to get across that the dangers are so low.
''If someone else came along I hope it would excite less patient
concern simply because of the publicity this has had. It is a gradual
educational process, not just for the health board who have to deal with
these things but for the public who have to react.''
Notwithstanding the inevitable sensationalism, Professor Browning
believed the media had reported his illness reasonably fairly, but its
speed and efficiency at spreading the word took him aback.
''The press knew about someone being infected before I knew the
diagnosis myself. The fact that I had to tell my family fairly quickly
had its advantages and disadvantages; they reacted very well.''
Nor, it has been established, have they been infected.
Professor Browning was unwilling to go into how he became infected --
in fact he claimed he did not know specifically. But he said he did not
contest reports on the matter at the time (that he was bisexual).
''Many of my friends knew that in the past few weeks I had not been
terribly well and had pneumonia. Nobody has really asked me how I got
it. They have basically been very sympathetic. I have been at no
particular pains to hide this.
''The question is still being investigated as to my ability to go into
theatre and give advice and I sincerely hope that that will be given,
and I see no reason why it should not be given.
''There are many ways of teaching which do not require you to do the
surgery on real-life patients. One of the considerable advantages of ear
surgery is that you can demonstrate how to do it on cadaveric tissue. In
Glasgow we have a history of running courses of that nature, it is not
just students from Glasgow who have benefited.
''Monday is very much a date set by the health board. I have done a
few undergraduate lectures and been in and out of the hospital picking
up my mail and doing my writing.''
When he entered medicine he had been following a family tradition, but
added: ''It seems very trite to say a desire to help other people;
that's what I said at the time, but I didn't really think about it. But
subsequently one does think about it, and there are some people who do
wish to contribute to society as opposed to other things in life, and
for some people this is the way to do it.
''But when you start off in medicine at the age of 18 you are young
and you don't really know what life is about.
''The other good thing about medicine which I think I realised at the
time is that it is so broad-ranging in the skills required that it can
embrace every individual's aptitude.''
Had he given much thought to the fact that he was ill and that his
life was likely to be foreshortened?
''Yes, of course. I am not ill at present, and long may that stay the
case, but one has to accept that it is not always going to be the case,
but that is the case for every person.
''It just so happens that I am more aware what my time is likely to be
than you are. That itself has its advantages. It does allow one to plan
what remains in a meaningful way.
''The option was given for me to stop doing medicine and my initial
reaction was, no way. But you take your time to think about it. Medicine
has been my biggest contribution and will continue to be. Medicine is
the best use of the time I have, rather than a new career.
''Outwith that, I may be more specific about how I spend my time. But
everyone should be doing that anyway -- everybody every so often should
sit down and think about what they are doing and whether they are
achieving what they think they are achieving.
''I don't want to go bungee-jumping . . . a little bit of white water
river rafting maybe. I went sailing on a tall ship before I was ill and
I enjoyed that. I have done most things. The trouble is -- nothing to do
with my illness -- as you get older there are some things you are
physically less able to do.
''The offers I have had to go to some places I haven't been, or see
friends I haven't seen for a long while, become more important.
''I was shattered when I got the diagnosis. Like any of these serious
things you adapt to it fairly quickly. In some ways the media attention
tended to divert my attention from my own problems at that time.''

POWER generators who have been heavily criticised recently for paying
their chief executives vast increases while shedding thousands of
workers are now agreeing to share their huge profits with their depleted
staffs.
PowerGen, which last year paid its chief executive #1.2m in salary,
pension and share options, has now agreed an inflation-busting 5.5% rise
for its 4000 employees and National Power's 5000 workers are in line for
a package worth up to 8% made up of increases averaging 4.5% plus a #460
lump sum.
These deals, which will not help Government attempts to curb wage
inflation, were immediately seized upon by Unison negotiators as
''pathfinder settlements'' which they said should be followed by other
power supply companies using their ample profits to give staff a decent
pay rise.
Last month union negotiators lodged claims with the 19 national and
regional power companies on behalf of 30,000 employees based on the
''bonanza'' power bosses had awarded themselves over the past year.
GMB national energy secretary Donald MacGregor maintained the
inflation-plus deals were more than well deserved. ''Given the obscene
rises in the bosses' pay everyone will recognise that our case was more
than justified,'' he said.
Under the two-year PowerGen deal basic salaries will rise by 5.5% from
April and will increase next April by the then inflation rate plus 0.5%.
The average salary of #20,145 will increase by #1108.
The National Power deal is also over two years with the second stage
giving increases of up to 8%, although the company expects them to
average out at about 5%.
Offers still under consideration include Hydro-Eletric, where staff
have been offered 2.8% plus a profit-related element said to take the
total for the year to 7.4%.

A lifelike dummy fooled warders for more than 12 hours before they
realised a prisoner had escaped from Downview prison in Sutton, south
London, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.
Jason Payne, 25, slipped out after he convinced a prison officer he
was a visitor with a headache who needed some tablets which were in his
car. Payne, a locksmith of Croydon, pleaded guilty to escaping custody.
He was given a 12-month sentence to run consecutively to the three-year
jail term he is already serving for conspiring to forge banknotes.

<TEXT>
EDINBURGH District Council, already under fire for its policy of
licensing saunas, which some believe are being used as brothels, has
granted a licence for a sex shop near the new Festival Theatre and two
mosques.
The licensing committee yesterday granted the licence to Del Boy
Enterprises for the basement of the tenement property at 8b Drummond
Street, Edinburgh. The sole director of Del Boy Enterprises is Mr
Vincent Delicato. He owns a video hire shop on the ground floor of the
tenement.
Plans for the sex shop have been attacked by local residents, the
business community, Edinburgh Central MP Alistair Darling, the Old Town
Trust, Edinburgh University students, the Church of Scotland and the
Imams of two mosques in the vicinity.
The Rev Ann Inglis, convener of the social and community interests
committee of the Presbytery of Edinburgh, said the Church of Scotland
wished to align itself with the other faiths in objecting to the shop.
''This application is as unacceptable to Christian people as to those
of other faiths'', she said. ''Such an establishment would be contrary
to the beliefs and standards which we hold are very important.''
Mrs Patricia Brindle, of the crime prevention panel for the area,
pointed out that the sex shop would be very close to the Canongate Youth
Project.
She was very concerned about the effect the shop would have on the
quality of life for people in the area.
Appearing for the applicant, Mr Ian Kennedy, admitted the committee
was faced with a ''difficult and complex issue''. Much had been made, he
said, of moral and physical danger being created in the area. Protesters
had mentioned the encouragement of prostitutes, vandalism, harassment of
women.
The protesters claimed it would not be safe for women or children to
walk the streets. ''There is only one problem,'' he said. ''There is not
a single shred of evidence to support this. Not a single crime
statistic.
''These objections are wholly misconceived and must be challenged.''
He added that when an activity was prohibited, all that happened was it
was driven underground. Licensing that activity meant a guarantee of
proper control and regulation.
''This is not about licensing a shop which intends to sell
pornography'', he said. ''That is against the law. It will not serve
children. Its product range will not be visible from the street.''
He added that the goods on sale were already available through mail
order firms. ''It may not be everyone's cup of tea'', he said, but to
refuse the licence would encourage intolerance and prejudice.

THREE years ago, Sunday afternoons offered an extended treat with
Radio Scotland's magisterial series, Scotland's Music. John Purser in
his survey of North British composers, from neolithic hornblowers to
contemporary musicians, was sometimes over-generous in his assessments.
But the quality of Scottish music of the Renaissance period could not
fail to impress the most sceptical listener.
Now Radio 3 has got the message about a Caledonian master. Robert
Carver, whose life (c 1490-1566) spanned the Scottish Reformation, is
This Week's Composer. The choice is all the more satisfying for falling
under the banner of Fairest Isle, Radio 3's year-long celebration of
British music. The Purcell song from which the title is taken implies
more than somewhat that Cupid's ''fav'rite nation'' is England. So it's
good to have this acknowledgement of Scottish cultural achievement
before union of crown or parliament had a chance to uncivilise us.
Carver's music is not only simply thrilling but complicatedly so. The
polyphonic effects of the 19-part motet O bone Jesu hang in the air, the
great block chords moving around to produce, in John Purser's words,
''astonishing effects''. Compliments to the singers, the Taverner Choir
and The Sixteen, who breeze through the complications of Carver's
scores. (I still blush to recall my inept public effort to hold on to
the second-top line of a Tallis motet -- and that had only 17 parts.)
Tuesday morning's work was the Carver mass based on the melody of the
popular fifteenth-century continental song, L'Homme Arme. Pat Kane's
Radio Scotland series Kane over America looked on Sunday at the armed
man, transatlantic version. And a fearsome sight he is too, whether in
the form of an overweight New York cop adding to his waist bulge with
his ironmongery or plaid-jacketed hunters taking off into the
Pennsylvanian or Californian undergrowth in the fall. The inalienable
(god-given?) right to carry weapons, enshrined in the second amendment
to the American constitution, has a lot to answer for.
Kane himself, remaining the detached interrogator, was able to pose
shrewd questions and elicit unguardedly revealing replies from gun
apologists and critics alike (even the latter seemed to possess their
own weaponry). It's a far cry (if not hue) from the rather intense young
man of yesteryear. I'll certainly try to catch the rest of his series,
whose topics include rural America (repeated tomorrow); the American way
of law; and sex, death, and God in Los Angeles. Joseph Heller of Catch
22 contributes to the final programme which examines the moral and
metaphysical state of the nation. Gosh.
The moral doubts of one pre-eminent American intellectual intruded on
lunchtime torpor on Sunday. Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Los
Alamos atom bomb project in the Second World War, mused on the fact
that, ''In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humour, no
overstatement can quite extinguish, the physicists have known sin.'' A
one-minute programme that haunted the rest of the day. It was from
Poetic Theorems -- a series of similarly succinct mind-bites from
thinkers ranging from Marcus Aurelius and Sir Isaac Newton to Thomas
Huxley and Stephen Hawkings.
Poetic Theorems was Radio Scotland's contribution to National Science
Week. All credit to Keith Halden for compiling this cerebral sequence
(read by David Rintoul of Dr Finlay fame). Radios 3 or 4 should have
snatched it up (was it offered to them?). Certainly on Monday night's
showing it had much more impact than Radio 3's own nightly Catalyst,
which aimed to examine the most important scientific developments of the
1940s. The first programme -- on the background to Crick's and Watson's
double-helix discovery -- got bogged down in a morass of voices and
information about earlier research.

TWENTY-THREE years on, Sparks' fraternal duo of Ron and Russell Mael
are still producing a radical, timelessly-futuristic, literate, witty,
compelling, and perfectly peculiar form of dance-pop. How best to
describe Thursday's night's show? Was it camp Hi-NRG glam-disco? Ironic
post-industrial synth-bop?
Amid the band's own on-stage potted palms, trickling fountain, and
marbled grecian columns, were we witnessing the hitherto largely-unsung
inventors of such disparate keyboard-based partnerships as Suicide and
the Pet Shop Boys? How come Russell Mael looks younger now than he did
in 1974? Ron's tap-dancing: did he teach Fred Astaire? How might one
obtain a phone number for slinky all-action percussionist Christi
Haydon?
Most importantly, are Sparks the only band in the world whose audience
can encompass -- as it did in Auld Reekie -- mature gay clones with
walrus moustaches; small children; lumpy blokes from Whitburn; bearded
hill-farmers wearing Barbour jackets, and young blonde women who have
rather thrillingly retro-styled themselves on a 1973 Chelsea Girl
catalogue?
But do you know the weirdest Sparks-facts of all? Despite Russell
still singing in his Germanic falsetto while immobile Ron retains the
same mask of simian mistrust he's always worn, Sparks' music hasn't
dated one bit and it's entirely unlike anything else in the whole
musical universe.
Check out Sparks' splendid new album, Gratuitous Sax and Senseless
Violins. If you like it, count yourself as strangely singular as the
crowd at a Sparks' gig. Impossibly, beautifully strange . . . that's
Sparks.

THE BEST OF FRIENDS
Joanna Trollope
Bloomsbury, #15.99
FERGUS starts it. Anyone who has changed his name from Leslie (after L
Howard, film star) is obviously suspect. And Fergus Bedford's sudden
decision to abandon wife, teenage daughter, and immaculate mausoleum of
a house to go off to London is the catalyst for all the emotional
upheaval in Joanna Trollope's latest novel, The Best of Friends.
The town of Whittingbourne, with its ruined abbey and episcopal
associations, may have a whiff of Barchester, but the human tragi-comedy
is strictly contemporary. Different generations are involved in this
not-so-merry-go-round of love. First there's the middle generation: the
Bedfords and the Woods. Fergus's wife Gina and Laurence Wood have been
close friends since schooldays. Nonetheless Laurence has opted for
marriage with stickit doctor Hilary -- tall, dark, and bespectacled --
and now runs a family hotel with her.
The emotional equilibrium between the four is destroyed by Fergus's
apostasy. Gina, depressed and unresourceful, throws herself on the other
couple and is finally diverted into counselling. Her counsellor tells
her: ''The thing is, victims get so greedy. They allow their needs to
develop to such a pitch that they make bottomless demands on other
people.'' The analysis, whether textbook or Trollope's own, is wise.
Gina takes to heart the advice that for rehabilitation ''love is a
very good place to start'' and is soon snogging with Laurence, her
erstwhile platonic friend. She feels a lot better. Understandably,
Laurence's displaced wife and both couples' children don't. Meanwhile
Fergus is in a cosy menage a deux with a gay admirer -- rendering his
daughter Sophy's already brittle psyche even more fragile.
Sophy is really the central character of this almost-morality tale.
Her resentful inability to communicate with her mother and doomed
hero-worship of her father ring psychologically true, as does her final
hardening into the blase teenage mould, any emotional dependency now
transferred to her peer group. Her brief, predatory sexual experience
with George, the eldest of the three Wood boys, is a rite of passage in
her inevitable but sad growing-up.
One may not warm to the new Sophy but the teenage Woods are a trio of
charmers, though they keep their bedrooms like bear-pits and smoke
surreptitiously. Joanna Trollope surely has affectionate access to male
young in real life to write so engagingly about them. Fourteen-year-old
Gus, two years Sophie's junior, is the girl's devoted swain. Will this
be the lasting friendship that echoes that of the parental generation?
Alas, Gus's idealistic ''crush'' seems to have evaporated by the final
pages.
It's left to the geriatric generation to make an unsullied pitch for
love. Gina's mother Vi is devoted to Dan, fellow inmate of sheltered
housing and as neat and shipshape as she is untidily flamboyant. This
affair is terminated not by deceit but death.
In the end, predictably, the Woods stay together. Gina has to find
non-sexual solace. It's a satisfyingly harsh, realistic, conclusion for
a novel whose earlier stages threatened to display the facile
romanticism of women's mags. There is a price to pay for grasping at
happiness regardless of responsibilities to others, Joanna Trollope
seems to be saying.
But -- I kept wondering -- would many men read this book? Its
exploration of the female psyche is more convincing than that of the
male equivalent. The two middle-aged husbands remain shadowy, though
animators of the novel's action.
Perhaps in the end the most endearing aspect of The Best of Friends is
its incidental aperus like the description of the distraught Gus as
''gaunt and gawky like a wet fledgling''. That and the humour. As of Vi
on her grand-daughter: ''Poor Sophy. More toilets than she knows what to
do with, and hardly a friend to her name.'' Or the scene in the
laundrette where George, recognising a girl from school now clutching a
large bald baby, is determined not to break the silence with a facetious
''That your's?'' and of course blurts out exactly those words.

There were times when the audience thought they'd die laughing, others
when comedians died a death. It was a tough apprenticeship and if you
survived the club circuit, you could survive anything. But times have
changed and it's the tradition itself that is dying. In his own
inimitable style, Andy Cameron looks back on the days when the show went
on regardless of beer cans or brickbats
WHERE have all the clubs gone? Well, they are still there, or most of
them are, but they have precious few turns nowadays. Not like the
seventies and early eighties when a turn could work every day of the
year and not perform in the same club twice. OK, some of them didn't
invite you back and others you wouldn't have gone back to anyway, but
that doesn't change the fact that they were there and they were
providing a stage on which to learn your trade.
Nowadays, of course, there are comedy clubs where young performers can
do stand-up (when I started out you were a comic or a chanter, or a
speciality act). But where do the young singers or musicians learn to
play an audience? In 1972 when I first stood on a stage with the sweat
running down my back and my knees knocking so loud the audience thought
I was a drum corps, the UCL was my Alma Mater. The University of
Clubland stretched from the Labour Club in Dumfries to the Dounreay
Social Club in Caithness and in between there were a million lessons to
be learned.
First lesson was: don't let the committee grind you down. How many
acts have heard the damning words of a committee man: ''Yer no' the top
of the bill here, son. The bingo comes first''? Or heard an MC announce
''Best of order for the bingo. Ye'll have bags of time tae talk when the
turn's on''?
My big argument with committee people was that I wouldn't do two spots
and that it was much better to have a comic on for one long spot than
breaking it up into two shorter spots which were separated by bingo,
pies and peas, and several meetings with Whyte and Mackay and Mr
Smirnoff!
Oh that I had a pound for every time I paralysed an audience in the
first half only to die the death an hour later. And don't believe a
comic who says: ''I've never died the death.'' Their first gig is
tomorrow.
These clubs I've mentioned were of course the exception rather than
the rule. There were a few ''stoaters'' in Clubland but most of them
were well-run and right good learning halls of the craft.
The thing about Clubland was that you could work in different parts of
the country every night of the week or you could ply your trade in one
area like Fife, say, and never leave a radius of 20 miles. Ah, Fife. The
Kingdom was magic. Lochore Welfare, Crosshill Miners, Caesar's Palace,
Lumphinnans. Venues that would turn The Gladiators into Morris dancers,
whose motto was ''In search of entertainment we leave no turn
unstoned''! Oh happy days. If you could get laughs in these places you
could work anywhere.
In those days in Fife there were miners. The salt of the earth. Real
people who worked hard and could drink more than Jack McLean thinks he
can. One night in Lochgelly Miners a man with hands like shovels handed
me my fee. ''Christ, son, hoo dae ye de that? Ye were up there for a
hale oor telling jokes. A hale oor. A dinnae ken hoo ye dae it.'' Now
this was a man who was getting up at five in the morning to do an
eight-hour shift doon the pit for less money a week than I was getting
for that night. And he was in awe of what I did for a living!
Ayrshire was another mecca of clubs in the seventies and one club
there was responsible for me deciding to carry on trying to make it
rather than selling my stage suit to the nearest ragman. One Sunday
morning I'd died the death in Danderhall Miners in the Lothians and was
all for calling Ochiltree Club in Ayrshire to tell them I'd had an
accident and wouldn't be on that evening in their club. However, having
been brought up right I couldn't let them down and off I headed to
darkest Burns country trying to convince myself that this was how George
Burns started. What a difference from the earlier debacle -- here was a
club that not only gave you a bit of order but they also gave you a
sit-doon tea at the interval. What a spread. I was beginning to think I
was George Burns.
Mind you, that was not unusual in Ayrshire clubs. New Cumnock Working
Men's Club did a rare tea, three courses and lovely teabread for afters.
No wonder the committee were all over 16 stones. One club which always
puzzled me in Ayrshire was Mauchline Kilmarnock Supporters and the
reason is simple. They had all the top acts in Scotland performing there
and they had some of the best turns among their own members.
Big Samson would have given Tom Jones a 10 break at the chanting and
beaten him by a mile. Billy McEwan could play the organ so well you'd
wonder where the rest of the orchestra were hiding, and every singer
from the audience was a star turn. Mauchline was the only club where I
ever felt I was imposing on the members. I always felt that a better
turn was sitting there watching me.
Of course there are still clubs that do cabaret -- bowling clubs, golf
clubs, and some others -- but it's not the big business it was 20 years
ago. What happened to change things? An assortment of things, really.
Most of the clubs were run by enthusiastic amateurs when it was really a
profession. The video age happened and a couple could get a video, a
carry-out, and have a good night at home for a tenner instead of paying
a tenner for two tickets for the show of the month when really we, the
acts, weren't giving them a lot that was different. Most of the comics
were stealing gags from each other and I'm as guilty as the rest, so
what the punter was getting was the same menu from very similar chefs.
There was a lot of right good acts in the clubs. One singer from
England whose name I forget was billed as the Voice from Nowhere because
he sang his first song outside the club on a radio mike and came in
through the nearest door to the stage. This took quite a trick until one
night at Tannochside Big Club somebody locked the door and he was caught
in a summer deluge. He gave us the next song looking like Jacques
Cousteau after a session exploring the Great Barrier Reef.
Maureen Hart was as funny a lady as I've ever seen. She told it like
it was. Big Mo could have them rolling in the aisles one minute and
greetin' into their drinks the next as she sung one of her own
compositions. Sadly she was taken by leukaemia before she made it right
to the very top.
The Great Scrodini, Clem Dane, Christian, they could all fill clubs
and Sydney Devine was the number one headliner in the clubs until he hit
the big time and then did the same in theatres. But the King of Clubland
was the auld yin, Hector Nicol. He was the daddy of them all. I saw a
woman one lunchtime in the Glacier Metal Club in Kilmarnock begging
Hector to stop because she was so sore laughing. That's what you call a
comic.
What was the top venue in Scotland? Well, how long is a piece of
string? There was the Rangers Club which is now the Edmiston Suite at
Ibrox where such stars as Billy Connolly, Lulu, Matt Munro, Tony
Christie, and dozens more were regulars. However, every act has their
favourites. Me? I liked St Brendans in Linwood, Gartcosh Social Club,
the Logie Club in Dundee, but anywhere you got laughs was a good club.
Even the Jubilee Bowling Club, where after doing an hour and a quarter
on Sunday lunchtime and the crowd yelling for more only to be told by
the MC: ''Aye, don't worry. Andy Cameron's coming back oan . . . he's
peyed tae quarter tae four!'' was a pleasure to work.
Certainly it was better than the Sullom Voe Oil Workers' Club which
would have had John Wayne and Walter Brennan running for cover. I played
there one night with two other acts and the response from the punters
was to build pyramids of beer-cans at every table and on a signal from
some wally at the front they were knocked over and you could hear the
clatter in Norway. On the flight back I can assure you nobody was
singing There's No Business Like Showbusiness.
So why did we do it? It was great fun. Some nights you could snap your
fingers and they'd laugh. Other nights you'd swear they'd been drinking
cement!
Some of my contemporaries say that the comics of today wouldn't last
two minutes in Clubland of yesterday. Aye they would . . . they'd have
to or they wouldn't work.

LOCAL residents have vowed to continue their fight to halt a #10m
courthouse project on common ground in Dumbarton despite claims by the
district council yesterday that the project was almost certain to
proceed.
Dumbarton District Council said the Scottish Courts Administration had
confirmed it now fully supported the local authority's decision to build
a new sheriff court for Dunbartonshire on Dumbarton Common.
The decision, based on the results of a geotechnical survey,
effectively rules out the possibility that the new courthouse could be
sited in Clydebank. Both Dumbarton and Clydebank district councils had
been vying for the past five years to have the replacement for the old
Dumbarton Sheriff Court sited in their area.
The courts authority will now enter into negotiations with the local
authority in Dumbarton for the sale of the land.
The final decision on the sale will be taken by the Court of Session
because the site is in common ownership. The court will publicise the
petition and take into account the views of local people before making a
decision. The procedure is likely to take several months.
The council's proposal stirred up protests from a number of local
people who do not want to lose Dumbarton Common. It is recognised as ''a
valuable community asset'' and has been in the ownership of citizens
since the seventeenth century.
Objectors have proposed that a new sheriff court building should be
built on a site at Church Street and Castle Street beside the existing
listed court building, incorporating the existing courthouse as part of
a new burgh hall.
They argue that it would provide the creation of a new public square
on land which is derelict and that it would save two listed buildings,
bringing more benefit to the town centre.
However, Provost Patrick O'Neill, said yesterday: ''While there are
some concerns in the community about the sale of common land, I believe
the overriding concern is to keep the court in Dumbarton for historic
and economic reasons.''

COMPLAINING about plagiarism in pop is almost as dumb as moaning about
improvisation in jazz, it is such an integral part of the form. Pop will
indeed eat itself, regurgitate, and then sit down to supper. So the fact
that Elastica don't do anything breathtakingly original is really
neither here nor there.
With their debut album straight in at number one, they are already a
great deal bigger than their oft-cited influence, left-field punk band
Wire, ever were, and their lift from the Stranglers' No More Heroes is
so blatant as to be rather endearing.
The illumination of a natty blue neon sign bearing the band's name may
have sparked one of the sporadic bouts of pogoing, but punk was never as
well played as this. Justine Frischmann and her cohort are a fine poppy
rock 'n' roll band and look and act the part.
Guitarist Donna Matthews is not only a great player she also swigs
lager and smokes ostentatiously while still looking rather too young and
cute to be the new Keith Richards. Drummer Justin, the token chap, is a
scrawny-looking powerhouse, and has that endearing habit of all the best
rock drummers of standing up at the end of songs.
They didn't really play much (just all they know), but those tunes
bristle with hooks, even if some of them have been appropriated from
elsewhere.
The neon sign was the centrepiece of an all-enveloping lighting rig of
coloured tubes and strobey lamps that was constructed just like a
outsized jukebox. An elaborate joke at the expense of their detractors?
It's nice to believe that's true.

BONNIE PRINCE CHARLIE IN LOVE:
The private passions of Prince Charles Edward Stuart
Hugh Douglas
Allan Sutton, #17.99
THIS year is the 250th anniversary of the Jacobite Rising of 1745, and
we may expect a plethora of books to celebrate the occasion. First into
the breach is Hugh Douglas with an eminently sensible and lucid account
of the Bonnie Prince's love life and sexual adventures.
Fifty years ago, Sir Compton Mackenzie wrote a book very much along
these lines but there were gaping holes in his knowledge. Recent
scholarly work has shed much more light on Charles Edward's private
life, so that it is extremely useful to have a concise overview of the
state of our knowledge on this subject.
The frequent taunt about all books written on the Jacobites is that
the subject has been written into the ground; such sentiments were
common even in 1945, on the two hundredth anniversary of the '45. For a
subject allegedly so well canvassed, it is remarkable how little was
actually known until a few years ago. As recently as 1973, Margaret
Forster in her The Rash Adventurer stated categorically that Charles
Edward was a virgin until his affair with the Princesse de Talmont in
1747.
In fact, as French sources particularly show, in 1746-47 he was as
promiscuous as any Regency buck. Then in 1747, before the Talmont
affair, he had a passionate but ultimately disastrous liaison with
Louise, Duchesse de Montbazon.
Moreover, he had commenced an affair with Clementina Walkinshaw in
Bannockburn in early 1746, and in 1752 took up with her again, in murky
circumstances which have only recently been unravelled. Marriage to
Louise of Stolberg completed the ''big four'' of important women in the
Prince's life, but there were dozens of other casual flings with maids,
adventuresses and courtesans.
''Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived'' is the
mnemonic many of us were taught at school about the six wives of Henry
the Eighth. ''Bolted, rejected, rejected, bolted'' might work as a
similar tag for the quartet of significant women in the Prince's life.
The affair with the most chance of success -- and probably the only time
the Prince was really in love -- was with Louise of Montbazon, but the
liaison became snarled up in raison d'etat, as Louis XV sought to expel
the Prince from his domains and the Prince resisted just as adamantly.
His dramatic arrest and physical ejection from France at the end of
1748 closed the chapter on the Montbazon romance, but the Prince sneaked
back into France and carried on his affair with the Princesse de
Talmont, partly in a Parisian convent and partly in Luneville. This
affair, with a significantly older bluestocking, was always doomed to
failure, for the couple were chalk and cheese.
What torpedoed the second liaison with Clementina Walkinshaw (1752-60)
was the Prince's discovery that, between the Bannockburn tryst and 1752
she had been the mistress of John William O'Sullivan, formerly his
principal Irish favourite and one of the famous ''seven men of
Moidart''.
In 1760, unable to take more of the Prince's drunken rages, beatings
and mental cruelty, Clementina did a disappearing act, with the
connivance of the French, taking Charlotte (the daughter she had borne
the Prince) with her. Twenty years later, in an uncanny rerun (for she
too lasted just eight years in his company, having married him in 1772),
Charles's wife Louise of Stolberg, a childless aesthete and would-be
bluestocking, also decamped from the Stuart household, and took up with
the poet Vittorio Alfieri.
Why were the Prince's relationships with women so disastrous? There is
no physical explanation, since the Prince was a highly-sexed man who
liked bedding women, unlike his homosexual brother, Cardinal York. It
seems to have been the old (and modern) problem of failure to integrate
love and sexuality. In the Prince's case, his ambivalence towards women
(needing them sexually, but despising them) was almost certainly the
product of his disastrous childhood experiences with his mother,
Clementina Sobieska, a neurotic and religious maniac who starved herself
to death when the Prince was 14.
Compounding the problem was the Prince's hatred for his father James
Francis Stuart, the ''Old Pretender''. The Prince finished his formative
years hating all authority figures, all older men who tried, as he put
it, ''to give him laws''.
''Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law'' is a maxim
attributed to Aleister Crowley, but it could have been the Prince's
motto. With few promptings of conscience, no ''superego'' controls
internalised from his father, and an image of women as pathetic and
weak, the Prince, not surprisingly, was as unhappy in his private life
as he was unsuccessful on the public stage.

Her joys might cause you agonies, her pleasures might provoke your
censure . . . but life with mum was never a matter of indifference
MOTHERS are always to blame, because your mother . . . was a
smothering, kind of cosy, but keenly claustrophobic symbol of
homeliness: a near-destroyer of your independence, who, maybe without
meaning to, projected into your young burgeoning sense of self her own
unfulfilled ambitions: putting her hopes and dreams into a cosy hot pot
and making you eat up every hated spoonful. (Before it had even cooled).
She was, you were sure, rather pathetically ashamed of the rough
school up north she went to, thought she pretends she wasn't, and simply
wanted the best for you. So what did she do? She sent you to an
appalling (though academically excellent) private one, making you feel
guilty as hell about the sacrifice involved and resulting in your
picking up that posh accent, which still sticks to your tongue like a
bur.
How could she do that to you? The result being that at university
nobody thought you were real. Everyone thought you were rich. Then you
hardly spoke at sociology tutorials out of pure radical embarrassment.
After all, you couldn't bring your ''Mam from Newcastle'' into every
single session, could you?
Your mother was shaped by a fifties notion of the maternal and of
course, she is not culpable, but it is amazing you have survived at all.
Unwittingly, she was a rotten role model for you in your formative
years, what with her lack of career, her total absence of chutzpah and
that habit she had of ironing not only dish towels but knickers, face
clothes and, for God's sake, socks.
And that's why you never got a first. (Like your friend Irene did).
Mothers are always to blame, because your mother . . . did not
completely manage to alienate you in spite of her being a self-centred
egomaniac, who warmly, expansively, and oh so liberally assented to all
your requests and demands.
No matter where, no matter when, no matter who with. As long as you
all bloody discussed it. And deep down you knew the truth. That your
mother would have said, ''Yes, all right, if that's what you really
want, sweetheart . . .'' to anything which did not involve her (a)
staying at home with her children or (b) giving you the necessary
restrictions which go with actually caring.
The year you were born she had a great job at the BBC, where she
famously took you to work from week one in what would become known, much
later, as a Moses basket. There was a photo of her holding you -- ''the
Bush House Baby'' -- the captions in the papers read. After the
photographers left she probably gave a canteen lady her autograph, and a
kiss on both cheeks as a down payment for doubling as a wet nurse.
The proof is in the pudding. (Talking of puddings, who wants a size
eight mother, when you are going through puberty?)
All the proof is right there in the photograph album. Not one
normal-looking pram in one normal-looking garden containing you in
sight. You had to suffer the slings and hammocks, back packs and front
packs, because she was in the forefront of fashion.
She was breaking new ground, a pioneer! She could have broken your
back. You wanted a proper Silver Cross pram with cotton sheets, fluffy
blankets and a proper synthetic bunny. Instead you lay naked on a real
lambskin.
Of course, she was educated at a fabulous-sounding Brighton boarding
school, where she obviously had a hilarious time, all laughter, A-levels
and lacrosse -- but, by the time she had acquired you, she had also
acquired a conscience, hadn't she?
So you were sent to this god-awful state dump in West London, like
something from a bloody Ken Loach film set, where nobody learnt
anything, and everybody distrusted you, and your friends' adapted
accents: the ones with parents who were posh or Labour MPs or arty.
So you never had a social life hardly at all during your teenage
years, because Mother and her friends gave you private tuition in the
evenings so you wouldn't become a plumber just for spite. All work and
no play, while they endlessly wined and defined. The pure hypocrisy of
it. And that's why you didn't finish your degree, (like your friend,
Justin did).
Mothers are always to blame, because your mother . . . is sweet,
generous, sixties, sensitive soul. You don't mean in her sixties. You
just mean ''sixties''. Yes, still. Encore. Ancora. To this day.
Even now she lights joss-sticks to welcome you home. Other people get
homesick when they smell freshly-baked bread, or scones or steak pie --
but for you it's the smokey waft of Neroli oil gently warming in its
little terracota dish. For decades it seems, she's been quoting that
Quentin Crisp line about dust not mattering after so many years.
One day in a botany class, everyone was asked did our mothers keep
plants? Your hand shot up and you proudly told your teacher that your
mum tends her plants so carefully, they live in a tin-foil-lined
cupboard in your kitchen, kept cosy by the light of their very own
anglepoise.
She believed domesticity was as dated as an anti-macassar. She still
thinks Dettol is a herbal laxative. She was held up by all your friends
as the parental ideal, while in private you lusted after their families'
privet hedges, and yearned for lawnmowers, fitted carpets, matching
towels on heated rails, and Frosties.
She bellowed ''abattoir'' every time she passed the local butchers.
Yes, all this seems perfectly familiar now, like yesteryear's New Age,
but in those days it made you into Daughter of Madam Bizarre -- round
where I lived anyhow.
She sent you to a Steiner school and, as it happens, you didn't learn
to read till you were 12. Your grandparents were going berserk,
threatening a cancellation of that Premium Bond inheritance. They
wouldn't invite your mother over for Christmas, and you wanted to go,
but didn't want to leave your mum. It was awful.
No first-footing them either at Hogmanay, it was horrible. She cried
about it, but she wouldn't budge you. But then, when you were 12,
everything turned around and became all right again.
It was a shame your grandparents didn't live to see you get your
double first. You would have probably asked them to the graduation.
But your mother didn't come to your graduation, did she? She didn't
know you wanted her to, because you didn't invite her. At the same time,
you didn't think, as your mother would say, that graduation ceremonies
were Her Thing.
(Other people's parents, the ones out buying hats and booking
non-vegetarian restaurants for the big day, they hadn't needed asking
had they?)
Mothers are always to blame, because they are the first ones we hit
with a small, fat fist. And most of us, the blessed majority, get
swiftly kissed back. Hugged in retaliation.
Our first fight was a soft touch with her. Wilde says we need to kill
the thing we love, so maybe it's natural, then, to accuse that which in
all probability loves us most.

TWELVE preludes and fugues may be fewer than 24 or 48, but never mind
the quantity -- the question that matters is, should they be played
singly or as a set?
Since David Johnson has described his own new contribution to the
genre as ''a personal document'' the implication is that he sees his 12
preludes and fugues for solo piano as an entity and that was how Peter
Evans played them at Edinburgh University on Thursday.
As a personal document, however, they perhaps meant more to their
composer than to the audience. Bach, Debussy, and Shostakovich cast
recognisable shadows across them, but in so doing tended to obscure what
lay beneath.
Though the composer's programme-note promised not only ''climaxes of
anger'' but ''bruised passion, hangover, and regret'', the music itself
seemed content to pursue a vein of comfortable whimsy, with reliance on
nursery rhymes, folk songs, Highland lullabies, innocuous bits of jazz,
and so forth.
Eking it out to fill a complete recital seemed to be stretching the
work's ambitions rather far. There were some nice touches of nostalgia,
with perhaps some far-off musical equivalent of Alan Bennett in an F
major fugue depicting ''red noses and white knees at the seaside''.
Though the preludes, full of deliberate hesitations and digressions,
seriously lacked propulsion, the fugues were rewardingly tighter-knit.
Peter Evans played them all in the quiet domestic way they seemed to
demand.

THIS debut by Diva gets off to an auspicious start, with an arresting
blaze of sound and vision heralding a particularly spectacular entrance
by Fiona Bell. As runaway bride Rosannah Deluce she plunges headlong
into the Alaskan log cabin of the reclusive Henry Harry (Sam Graham),
escaping the roaring blizzard outside but finding no respite from
personal demons within.
Exhausted and confused, Rosannah garbles about a dead car and
collapses. She awakes two days later to find that Henry has washed and
cared for her but has cooked her satin slippers, a quirky detail which
becomes a missile in their combative relationship -- ''You cooked my
shoes!'' -- and which is eventually revealed to carry great emotional
significance for Henry.
Directed with bold panache by Caroline Hall, the semi-cryptic
exchanges interrupted by explosive physical struggles, this play by the
American Cindy Lou Johnson is both tender and tenacious, capturing as it
does exquisite scenes of human vulnerability and capably grappling with
existential themes. Rosannah, on the brink of nervous collapse, has been
overwhelmed by a sensation of isolation and has fled from her wedding
guests on a hysteria-fuelled drive from Arizona to Alaska, desperately
seeking ''one person who connects you to this earth''. Henry has sought
isolation following a personal tragedy.
The two have complementary needs to love and be loved, but can only
find redemption after fraught emotional catharsis, which Bell and Graham
convey compellingly. Bell's evocation of distress has great conviction,
if sometimes over tremulous, while Graham's performance is superb, his
still, calm poise radiating a muscular energy.

THE Government, faced with the problem of trying to legislate on
privacy before the next General Election, may pass the problem over to
the Press Complaints Commission.
Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, said yesterday work had been
undertaken to draw up a report on privacy which he was considering
publishing.
''I think it would be possible for the commission to use that material
as part of their system,'' he said.
He added he believed the self-regulatory process in place could be
used and the code provided by the research carried out by his department
should also apply to the electronic media. However, if a criminal
offence was involved, legislation would be required.
Meanwhile, restrictions on photographing people in their own gardens
were eased yesterday.
The move comes after a review by the Editors' Code Committee of clause
four of the newspaper industry's code of practice dealing with privacy.
The code stated intrusions or inquiries into an individual's private
life without their consent were ''not generally acceptable'' unless in
the public interest, including pictures of people on private property
without their agreement. The committee decided this should be eased to
allow photographs to be taken without telephoto lenses if the person is
''fully visible'' to the public.

Tokyo, Friday
THE Japanese religious sect linked to a nerve gas attack on the Tokyo
subway publicly proclaimed its innocence today, but Russian authorities
were reported to be considering a ban on the group.
Shoko Asahara, founder of the Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth Sect),
denied in a tape sent to Japanese television that chemicals seized by
police in sect buildings this week were related to Monday's attacks,
which killed 10 people and left 5500 sick.
In a separate interview, cult spokesman Yoshinobu Aoyama claimed that
US military forces based in Japan could have been responsible for the
subway killings. The American Embassy dismissed the charge as unworthy
of comment.
Aoyama, a lawyer and sect member, announced that he was suing the
Tokyo city administration for compensation for three days of police
raids on its various premises.
In what has amounted to a military-style operation involving thousands
of officers and chemical experts wearing gas masks, police have turned
up tonnes of chemicals inside the sect's warehouses at Kamiku Isshiki
village, west of Tokyo.
Police said they were keen to question the elusive Asahara about why
his group had the chemicals, identified as key ingredients of sarin, the
gas used on the Tokyo subway.
Russia, meanwhile, was reported to be considering whether to bar the
sect from its territory. Aum, which says it has 30,000 members in
Russia, broadcast regular messages to Russia and Japan until the
transmissions were stopped this week.
Interfax news agency quoted Deputy Justice Minister Vladimir Kuzmin as
saying Moscow would revoke the sect's registration if proof emerged that
it carried out the subway attack.
Sect leader Asahara said in the television videotape that the chemical
stocks found on Aum premises had nothing to do with the sarin attack and
were intended for peaceful purposes.
''This is all a bashing campaign against our sect,'' said the bearded,
long-haired guru.
''Sodium fluoride is used to make pottery,'' he said calmly.
''Phosphorus trichloride is used to make plastic materials and also as a
herbicide. I cannot see how one can make sarin out of these
substances.''
Chemical experts were sceptical. ''I have never heard of sodium
fluoride being used for pottery,'' said a professor at the Tokyo
University of Fine Arts.
Meanwhile, public prosecutors formally arrested today four doctors
detained earlier this week in the raids on sect premises. They were
charged with false imprisonment and illegal administration of
drugs.--Reuter.

Port Stanley, Friday
THE governor of the Falkland Islands, David Tatham, said today that
the islanders would never improve relations with Argentina until Buenos
Aires dropped its claim to the southern archipelago.
Speaking at the residence stormed by invading Argentine troops in
1982, he said: ''The islanders find it difficult to have a rapprochement
with a country that says we will take you over by the year 2000.''
He dismissed moves by Argentina to win over the islanders with
reported offers of cash to surrender their sovereignty and free holidays
in Argentina.
''I think it is both insulting and in vain, and also a sad reflection
on the morals of Argentine politics, the belief that everyone has their
price,'' he said.
''They are definitely playing a hearts and minds campaign but they do
not understand the Falklands character.''
President Carlos Menem has pledged Argentina will regain the islands
it calls the Malvinas by peaceful means by the year 2000. That claim is
enshrined in the Argentine constitution.
''Relations with Argentina are bound to be distant as long as the
Argentine claim to the islands is there. Until they drop it, it is
difficult for us to treat them as neighbours,'' said Mr Tatham.
London and Buenos Aires have had talks about joint oil exploration but
the Government has made it plain that the way oil exploration develops
is up to the islanders.
Mr Tatham said it ''seemed to be impossible'' to find a formula for
oil development that would gain Argentine consent.--Reuter.

ANYONE who has ever been trapped in a lift with a journalist (stay
calm and bang your head off the nearest wall until help arrives) will
know that the profession's fascination with itself is matchless. Only
the media would fail to find the publication of endless media columns as
self-regarding as a bathroom-mirror salesman; only on television would
the making of TV news count as news.
There is nothing you can do about it, of course. Whose News ran for
most of the week on Channel 4 and set itself the task of asking who
controls and shapes the factual commodity. Evidently it did not expect
us also to inquire who, at the fourth channel, decided we had to know.
Journalism is important; every journalist says so.
The result, though, amounted to little more than a bunch of
distinguished hacks agonising, some seeds of vapid theory borne on the
trade winds from America, and the occasional profoundly inarticulate
mogul trying to pretend that megalomania is just part of life's rich
tapestry.
Ted Turner, founder of CNN, is one, and such a one. Naked Truth -- The
Tycoon (Thursday) had him delivering the usual schtick about news as the
voice of democracy, claiming a ''personal role'' in the ending of the
cold war, and demonstrating in a face-to-face with Castro that the
network's survival has nothing to do with its owner's journalistic
instincts. Such was the documentary's relentless pursuit of truth that
no-one even mentioned Ted's odd marriage to Jane Fonda.
A friend, presumably now a former friend, of the Georgia guru did note
that ''Ted always hated news. He thought it was bad. He thought it made
people feel bad''. That's the spirit. Otherwise we were offered the
hoary old line about the media making news (the O J Simpson circus)
rather than just reporting it. Is that, for anyone currently breathing,
still news?
The media being what we are it was, of course, inevitable that The
Late Show (BBC2, Thursday) would trash Naked Truth before this column
could produce its baseball bat. As is now traditional with Mark Lawson's
snake-pit, well-paid journalists worried about the profession's malign
influence as though it had nothing to do with them before proceeding to
flay a couple of hapless authors.
The flaying of Martin Amis, proceeding nicely throughout the
English-speaking world, was some compensation for the South Bank Show
(ITV, Sunday), the programme that never, ever plugs anything. Amis,
visage like a melting ice-cream, paid for his ITV luck by reading his
own work very badly on BBC2 and having yer man Tom Paulin trample over
it in pit boots. A lousy job, but someone has to do it.
Paulin, who deserves his own show (Natural Born Curmudgeons?) then
proceeded to tear strips off Alan Bennett, another eighties icon, and
his movie about mad George III. My notes suggest that Paulin called it
''royalist tosh'' and ''monarchist piss'' but I'm not sure we can say
''monarchist piss'' in The Herald. We can say it's high time more people
on television took such an attitude to the unmagical business of
writing.
The thought comes too late to save last week's Bookmark (BBC2,
Saturday), however. The Ordinary Madness of Charles Bukowski was the
story of a man whose real talent was for luck, of which he had more than
a dozen lottery winners. Chuck was ''born knowing he was a genius'', a
condition which is nearly always fatal. This was the romance of failure
as success, a reverential attempt to ask if you really can booze and
write.
As well ask if you can write and not booze, if you can booze and not
write, if writing is not just a style accessory for the self-fixated.
Bukowski was beaten by his father, he said, and beaten by life. He
therefore made being beaten a way of life, and of art. Inevitably a
doctor told him to stop drinking or die; inevitably he went right on
drinking. He had a face like the ruins of Troy but they were the ruins
of Troy, Indiana. Could he write? Left with Bookmark's evidence alone
we'll never know.
In Four Walls, the second of BBC2's Lambrusco Nights, Elaine C Smith
played a woman who knew all about being beaten yet who needed, more than
anything, a little more writing.
Doreen McCardle's script glittered, but only fitfully, and the point
at which the inevitability of her character's tragedy became cliche
could be sighted some way in advance, like a slow train on a clear day.
It may be a cruel thing to say about a serious subject, but Four Walls,
well played and directed, was predictable.
Trust a man to say so. Trust this one to put up with Patrick Stewart
roaring the commentary for MGM: When the Lion Roars (BBC2, Saturday)
simply to learn a little more about Irving Thalberg, the original Last
Tycoon and the only studio suit the Marx Brothers ever trusted. That's
no small praise, but this account of Metro from 1924 to 1936 was
redeemed only by the clips.
Otherwise it quickly revealed itself as one of those corporate
''celebrations'' which have more to do with shifting the back catalogue
than with art or fun.
Manningham Diaries (C4, Saturday) was a good example of why the Red
Light Zone season is failing to ignite. Bradford prostitutes, rehearsed
and directed, wandered an old warehouse reading accounts of their lives.
This was dull. They all knew their lines and soon you had them by heart
too. This also was dull.
There was a TV set in a dustbin and a perverse homage to Peter
Sutcliffe, icon of serial killers, a sad little geek in a Sta-prest
suit, for no obvious reason. There was romance, not reality, video
romance, sleeze romance, a set designer's romantic squalor.
Chuck Bukowski would have loved it, yet it only proved why Band of
Gold (ITV, Sunday), a proper drama of the whore's life, is infinitely
preferable.
Still, all is not lost. Blackadder the Third (BBC1, Tuesday) is being
repeated for the umpteenth time and still managing to be the funniest
thing on TV. Edmund, thank God, has ''a plan so cunning you could pin a
tail on it and call it a weasel''. That's writing too, if only
television's arts departments knew it.

UNCERTAINTY surrounded the future of the island of Eigg yesterday, as
its controversial owner, Mr Keith Schellenberg, steadfastly denied he
had sold his estate for #1.6m.
There are claims that Mr Marlin Maruma, a German artist and
millionaire, has bought the West Coast island which in recent years has
been torn by acrimony between the 75 residents and their laird.
Yesterday, however, Mr Schellenberg, a former British Olympic
bobsleigher, was at his desk in his island lodge office, and insisting
he is still the owner.
He said: ''The island has not been sold. I can't answer as to why this
chap is saying that he has bought it. The island is not for sale, it is
not on the market, and has not been put on the market.
''It is completely incorrect to say that the island has been sold, or
say that it ever will be. The more this type of thing appears, then the
less likely any changes will occur at all.''
Asked if any deal was pending with Mr Maruma, or if any sale document
was waiting to be signed, Mr Schellenberg replied: ''I don't want to
comment on that.''
He also refused to say if there ever had been a deal pending between
him and Mr Maruma, or if they had ever been in contact.
Speculation has been rife on the island that Mr Maruma has bought, or
is about to buy Eigg, and the local Residents Association is hoping Mr
Schellenberg will sell.
Its spokesman, Dr Christopher Tiarks, was equally confused by the
publicity surrounding the future of his island home.
He said: ''Your guess is as good as mine about what is going on. I
wish I knew. We are not privvy to any information at all. I believe Mr
Maruma was on the island a year ago but, as far as I know, he has not
been in touch with anyone on the island recently. Certainly, he hasn't
informed me that he is the new owner.''
Quoting from a statement issued on behalf of all residents, he added:
''The fact that the island may have been sold without the community
having any knowledge, let alone involvement, typifies the problems of
land ownership in Scotland, and gives us no assurance.''

Ankara, Friday
TURKISH planes were today accused of bombing several remote mountain
settlements inside Iraq in defiance of Western calls to safeguard
civilians during Ankara's operation against Kurdish rebels.
Six houses in the village of Dergele, 60 miles east of the Iraqi
border town of Zakho, were badly damaged, villagers said. They added
that one person was wounded in the air strikes on Wednesday.
''Three planes came and dropped bombs. Then they left and came back
and dropped more,'' said one 40-year-old man from Dergele. Nearby
villages of Besili and Gulka were also hit by Turkish jets, people said.
However Turkish military spokesman Colonel Dogu Silahcioglu insisted
today there had been no air raids on Dergele, saying: ''There is
definitely nothing like that.''
Turkish officials say there have been no civilian casualties in five
days of a land and air operation launched into northern Iraq to root out
guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. The guerrillas use
bases in northern Iraq to hit targets in Turkey.
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said earlier she had given ''the strictest
orders ever'' that civilians be spared, but EU foreign ministers
visiting Ankara today still demanded a swift end to Turkey's invasion.
Ciller called for international action to prevent the rebels from
exploiting lawlessness in northern Iraq that started with the end of the
Gulf War in 1991.
''This is not our making. If we do not want the Turkish soldiers to be
there to protect our innocent people then we have to come up with an
international solution to the problem,'' she said. ''The European Union
has to help us to provide that security to the borders.''
Turkish forces were today said to be firmly in control of the main
roads in a 25-mile deep zone in north Iraq.
Iraqi Kurds in northern Iraq are protected against possible attack by
Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein by Western aircraft taking part in
Operation Provide Comfort, which is based in Turkey.
The planes resumed flights yesterday to enforce the no-fly zone over
northern Iraq, but are staying away from Turkey's incursion, US
officials said.--Reuter.

THE General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing moved a step
closer to lifting the union's ban on industrial action during a visit to
Scotland yesterday.
Speaking at the opening of the annual Scottish conference in Glasgow,
Ms Christine Hancock said the so-called no-strike rule was ''outdated''.
She later told The Herald: ''I am committed to changing the rule,
although not committed to striking.'' Her comments are thought to be
stronger than previous official statements.
Nurses and officials gathered at the opening address, which was
organised as part of the union's Fair Deal pay campaign. The union
represents 32,000 nurses in Scotland.
They demanded a 3% pay rise for all nurses -- the Government has
offered a guaranteed increase of just 1%, and said nurses must negotiate
further rises with their local health managers.
Ms Hancock said trusts in Scotland appeared to have taken a harder
line in pay talks than their counterparts in the rest of Britain.
Several hospitals in London have already offered rises of around 3%.
She said higher awards in other areas could lead to nurses leaving
Scotland for better salaries.
Ms Hancock told her audience that the campaign to win a 3% rise should
be maintained. She said the 1% offer was a ''public smack in the face''
for nurses.
She said: ''Nurses feel unvalued and undermined -- the money is there
to pay each and every nurse in the country 3%. Together we can make
ourselves heard loud and clear.''
Ms Hancock said the college's traditional ban on industrial action had
been overtaken by changes in legislation and the health service.
She added: ''I have never heard nurses use the words 'strike action'
as strongly and frequently as they have recently.
''I still don't believe nurses would actually walk away and leave sick
patients. The principle of not harming patients is one nurses want to
hold as strongly as they ever did, but they want to have some way of
putting pressure on individual local employers.''
The ban on industrial action will be discussed at the college's
national council meeting next month, and the union's congress in May.

SCOTTISH Natural Heritage has submitted its bid for #10m funding from
the Millennium Commission for its Paths for All initiative.
The project is aimed at improving access to the countryside around
Scotland's cities, towns, and villages through greatly improved networks
of local paths. The initiative was first proposed last October when SNH
launched its policy paper on access.
A spokesman for SNH said: ''Scotland has much poorer opportunities for
access than the rest of Britain and a major effort is needed to help
people get out into the countryside for recreation near to where they
live.''
If the Millennium Fund bid is successful, it is hoped that 200
networks will be created within the first 10 years.
It is anticipated that half the total cost of #20m will be met by the
Millennium Commission, the remainder being made up by SNH, local
authorities, and other organisations such as local enterprise companies.
SNH is taking the lead in a consortium of interests including local
communities, land-owning and managing interests, and the public bodies
which help to fund and manage facilities for open air recreation.
Launching the bid, Mr Magnus Magnusson, the chairman of SNH, said:
''Paths for All will provide the perfect opportunity for everyone in
Scotland, no matter where they live, to get out and enjoy the
countryside.
''Walking is an activity which appeals to us all. A network of
well-maintained and signposted paths will greatly help people feel more
assured and welcome in the countryside.
''It will help land managers through making sure that paths are
located to avoid problems, it will give a boost to local economies in
the tourist areas, and it will add to the quality of life in Scotland.''

Stiletto heels are a fashion statement. And the statement would seem
to announce that here totters a misbegotten, shameful object, ripe for
abuse. Anvar Khan tiptoes into the world of the neanderthals
STILETTOS are man-made. This is an important fact to remember,
especially when looking for scapegoats to curse. Stilettos are the
Caucasian equivalent of foot-binding. The idea of any deformity being
sexually attractive is dodgy, as if guys want their own, special
Quasimodo. But deform they do. Stilettos break the mind, the heart, the
body, and the spirit. And how.
These small, screwdriver daggers are associated with high fashion and
adventurous sex. So much so, that feminists felt it was safer to ignore
them than tackle the seriously seedy aspects of male and female
sexuality they flirt with. Stilettos are a blatant advert for
heterosexual sex. And even if men claim they do not understand the
nature of womankind, they gather that if she puts on a pair of Marquis
de Sade heels, she has consciously made the decision to reduce her
sentient self into an object. Stilettos are shorthand for availability,
like short skirts. There are elements of clothing which will never set a
woman free from prejudice or blame.
I have, therefore, always believed that nobody sensible wears
stilettos, and after a day in red, patent six-inchers, I know this to be
true. You need a lot of time on your hands because nothing can be done
quickly. Cars go at miles per hour, you go at centimetres per second, in
not so much a gliding walk as a regimented creep.
The neds were out and about town. Nae job, nae money, nae class. There
were swarms of them, boys who think that picking their nose is a
competitive sport. Neds always feel free to pass comment on the effort
one has made with one's appearance. Men, in general, however ugly and
uncouth, suffer from wild delusions of grandeur.
The smelliest, most unkempt, unspectacular specimen will really
believe that it's his prerogative to chat up the sexiest, most
beautiful, or most elegant of women. I was not in any such thoroughbred
league in stilettos, especially when I found it impossible even to stand
up properly, but, nevertheless, my stooped posture and hiccuping mince
made me fair game.
Attractiveness combined with incapacitation is definitely some kind of
aphrodisiac for our hirsute and horrendous playmates. There were whoops
and hollers of primate approval as I was rushed by a sprawling plasma of
undesirable homeboys, who, I imagined, had bikini pix of Pamela Anderson
in their rooms alongside Celtic and Rangers match memorabilia. I'm not
going to repeat what they said in my ear as they engulfed me, because
this is a family newspaper, and there are some things you just don't
need to hear.
But given my footwear, I was in a bigger position of physical weakness
than usual. And for the endless minutes it took for them to filter
through, I felt sick with intimidation.
In a pair of a stilettos, decent people do pay homage to the beast of
womanhood. They make the effort to dodge you. Subconsciously, they
realise that you are restricted in movement, and if there isn't to be a
collision on the pavement then it's up to them. Woman in stilettos has
right of way. Sometimes, though, when it's busy, it's best to stop and
wait until things clear, because once you've mastered the art of the
straight line it's best to try to stick to it.
If anything, wearing high heels teaches you humility -- you're always
on the verge of falling down. The inevitable tactical problems are real
and numerous. Stilettos ask you to tip-toe instead of walk, like a
ballerina on blocks. The muscles of a dancer are vital, as well as the
15 years' training. Suddenly, you have loads of leg and nowhere to put
them.
In transit, your body becomes an inelegant shambles getting in and out
of a car or taxi, but never bus it. Ladies don't travel by bus. It's
important to swing backwards and forwards in your seat to gain enough
momentum to rise. I wore my stilettos with a mummifying, Black Watch
tartan skirt, and believe me, the inner-thigh-squeeze is the only
exercise which will prevent you from showing more than you are already.
That, and matching knickerbockers.
But throughout the whole afternoon, while I broke my pain threshold to
shuffle past roadworks and bum-baring, pie-eating diggers; while I
braved an unexpected onslaught of snow and wind and rain (you need fixed
climactic conditions, not variable), and wished the council would smooth
out all the valleys, cliffs, and crevices in the pavements, the one
image which kept entering my fevered and resentful mind was that of
church steeples, jutting out like stalagmites from the floor of the
planet. If the man who fell to earth had been a bit bigger, he would
have been punctured within any two-mile radius of the city. Elongated
winklepicker heels cover Britain like a bed of nails.
Stilettos do not add to a person, they detract. They are physically
dangerous and psychologically corrupt, for reasons that I'm not yet sure
of. It is masochistic to wear stilettos. It is sadistic to design them
in the first place. Any sexual power they claim is twisted. And if that
doesn't propel you into buying a pair, nothing will.

PERTH and Kinross District Council has won its fight to prevent
drilling operations by an American company.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang dismissed an appeal against planning
permission refusal for a mine at Duntanlich, by MI-Great Britain, a
subsidiary of the MI Drilling Fluids Company of the USA.
The firm wanted to extract 200,000 tonnes of barytes annually over the
next 30 years.
The appeal resulted in a public inquiry into the proposal for a site
which lies within the upland area between Loch Tummel and Strathtay.
Part of the site also falls within a National Scenic Area and the
remainder is in an Environmentally Sensitive Area.
Mr Lang said he had to weigh up the possible environmental impact on
the National Scenic Area against the likely economic and employment
benefits if the mine was to proceed.
He added: ''In this instance, given the clear evidence presented at
the inquiry on the environmental damage which could be caused, I have
concluded that the benefits that could accrue from this development are
not sufficient to outweigh my obligations to conserve the Scottish
landscape in this particular area.''

A FOUR-year-old boy who ''didn't like the games that daddy was playing
with him'' was among almost 150,000 children who telephoned ChildLine
Scotland last year.
Counsellors on the helpline believe the boy was being sexually abused
and advised him to talk to his mother about the problem. The case was
not followed up because the charity's strict confidentiality policy
deems this should only happen in life-threatening situations.
The harrowing case emerged yesterday as Ms Esther Rantzen made an
impassioned plea for the Government to match the generosity of the
British public in supporting ChildLine.
The helpline founder and current chairman made her appeal in Glasgow,
at the opening of the charity's new Scottish headquarters.
Pointing out the charity -- set up eight years ago -- was relatively
new compared to more established charities, she said: ''The British
public are very generous because they believe that children are
important. I believe the Government ought to match that generosity.''
Although 12,000 calls a month are received north of the Border from
children aged from four to 18, the charity claims that pressure on
resources means that only one in four calls are actually answered. About
17,500 children were given advice by trained counsellors on the helpline
last year.
ChildLine Scotland has counselled more than 68,000 children since it
was set up in 1990, as part of the UK children's helpline.
The specially-converted accommodation in Albion Street should
ultimately allow twice as many calls to be heard. However, ChildLine
Scotland says it still needs #60,000 to complete work on the facility.

THE lead singer of a British pop group died in a German hospital
yesterday following a minibus crash.
Mr Alan Barton, of the band Smokie and formerly front man for
Eurovision Song contest group Black Lace, had suffered serious head
injuries in the accident on Sunday.
He had been in a coma in a Cologne hospital since then.
His wife Jacky was by his bedside when he died, the group's manager
told German television.
The 41-year-old singer was injured when a minibus carrying members of
the band to Dusseldorf airport after a concert careered off the road and
plunged down a ravine during a hailstorm.
Guitarists Alan Silson and Terry Uttley were also injured in the
crash.
Mr Uttley, who needed stitches in his face, and Mr Silson, who broke
his nose, were reported to have returned home to Ilkley, in West
Yorkshire.
Smokie first hit the charts in 1975 when If You Think You Know How To
Love Me reached number three.
They followed this with easy-listening melodies, including Don't Play
Your Rock 'n' Roll To Me, Living Next Door To Alice, It's Your life,
Needles and Pins, and Oh Carol -- all of which were in the top ten.
Mr Barton, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, became lead singer for the
band in 1992, replacing Chris Norman.
He leaves his wife and two children.

AN AYRSHIRE policewoman became the most senior female officer in
Scotland yesterday when she was promoted to the rank of chief
superintendant.
Miss Sandra Hood, 48, formerly a superintendent and currently serving
in F Division in Glasgow's South Side, was appointed divisional
commander in Ayr by the Chief Constable of Strathclyde, Mr Leslie Sharp.
She is likely to be the only woman ever to hold the rank of chief
superintendant in Scotland. It will be officially phased out on April 1
as a result of recommendations in the Sheehy Report.
Chief Superintendent Hood said her appointment was a clear indication
that women were already being treated equally in the police.
''When I joined 25 years ago, women worked mainly with inquiries
concerning women and children or crime concerning women and children.
That has changed immensely.''
During her career, she carried out full operational duties and served
for five years as a chief inspector in one of Scotland's busiest beats
in Glasgow city centre.
More recently, Miss Hood was deputy divisional commander at F
Division based at Aikenhead Road police office in Glasgow where her
duties included being match commander at big games at Hampden Park.
''This is an exciting time for women. You just have to look through
the force. Everywhere women are deployed and doing responsible jobs,''
she said.
She will now become the senior police officer in the division where
she began her police career: ''I was born and brought up in Ayr, it is
pleasing for me to go back to R division where I served as a constable
on the beat.''

THE COMPANY which built the private HCI hospital at Clydebank is part
of a consortium preparing a bid to design, build and maintain a
multi-million pound NHS hospital in Edinburgh.
The Herald can reveal that John Laing Construction has joined British
Linen Bank and the Miller Group to form the consortium which has
expressed an interest in the contract for the new Edinburgh Royal
Infirmary.
Among the other firms preparing a bid for the new hospital, expected
to cost around #150m, is McAlpine Healthcare Limited, a recently formed
company specialising in NHS contracts.
Around 30 companies from all over Europe, the majority from Britain,
will compete to win the contract to build the 950-bed hospital at Little
France on the south side of Edinburgh.
The consortium which wins the contract will bring in architects to
design the building and build it themselves. Once it opens they would
bring in a management company to do, among other things, run the
catering facilities, look after the gardens and employ porters.
Last night the Scottish secretary of health union Unison, Mr Matt
Smith, said the private sector interest shown in building the new ERI
was part of ''the creeping privatisation'' in the health service.
Mr Smith said: ''Even as short a time as five years ago the majority
of the building work on new hospitals would have been done in-house.''
The notes of interest came in after the trust which runs the present
Royal Infirmary, which is due to close in six years, placed contract
details for the new hospital with the European Union.
Senior workers at the ERI will now evaluate the interest.
One local source said: ''Three groups will be shortlisted by the end
of May. Then the trust will sit down and talk to them and come up with
one which they prefer.
''In effect the private company would own the building and lease it to
the trust who would staff the hospital.
''This is where the Scottish Office comes in. They will have to give
any private scheme the go-ahead.
''Lord Fraser said in November he had not completely ruled out public
funding for the project.''
Work is expected to start next year and be completed around the turn
of the century.
Both John Laing Construction and McAlpine Healthcare Limited last
night confirmed they had noted interest in the hospital.
There is still a question mark over the future of the present ERI site
off the Meadows. The district council has had plans to take it over and
turn it into a community-led development rejected by the Scottish
Office.
Local councillors and Edinburgh Central MP Alistair Darling are
concerned that the old ERI site may be offered as a sweetener to the
consortium which wins the competition to run the new hospital.
Edinburgh District Council leader Lesley Hinds said the Government
should try to build the hospital from its own cash reserves.
She said the Scottish Office would be guaranteed up to #8m from the
sale of the old ERI site.

Brussels
SEVEN European Union states will tomorrow dismantle internal border
controls but Britain's resistance to the idea means that travel could
become more complicated for UK citizens.
The seven -- Germany, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain
and Portugal -- are all signatories to the Schengen Agreement, so called
because it was drawn up in the Luxembourg town of that name.
Their move is the first significant attempt by EU states to bring
about the freedom of movement the Community believes is necessary for
the effective working of the European single market. The new arrangement
will be accompanied by tougher immigration measures along the EU's
external borders.
From tomorrow there will be new, fast-lane channels at airports and
ports for citizens of states which have signed the Schengen accord. This
means other EU citizens, including the British and Irish, will have to
join queues where passports are still checked. Delays could occur.
One British Tory MEP, Sir Jack Stewart-Clark, warned on Thursday that
the UK authorities would resist increased checks. ''We will be ready to
make a very big complaint if this happens,'' he said.
Britain has remained outside the Schengen deal because it fears it
would allow illegal immigration through the EU to the UK and that it
will weaken measures aimed at preventing terrorism and other
international criminal activities.
This is the latest issue on which the UK has isolated itself in Europe
although it has the unwilling support of the Irish who feel compelled to
follow the British example because so much of its cross-border traffic
is with British ports.
Other states are moving towards joining the Schengen seven. Italy and
Greece have signed the agreement and will join when their computerised
information systems are compatible. Austria, an observer since July
1994, is to become a full member next month.
Denmark is currently negotiating the observer status. Finland and
Sweden, which have a passport union already, want to join the accord but
their situation is complicated by Norway, which declined EU membership
last year.
''Norway cannot become a member of Schengen because it is not a member
of the EU,'' French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure said.
From tomorrow passengers moving within the Schengen states' internal
borders will use domestic departure gates at airports without being
required routinely to submit to identity checks.
Airports have rushed to construct special terminals to accommodate
three different kinds of passenger -- EU Schengen travellers, those from
EU non-Schengen states such as the British, and third country nationals.
Mr Lamassoure said that soon all continental EU members would be
aboard, putting pressure on Ireland and Britain. ''I think that once our
British friends see travellers between Heathrow and Roissy facing the
same controls as those coming from Washington they will see the sense of
joining Schengen,'' he said.
The Schengen computer, based in the French town of Strasbourg,
contains 10 million files and a million names of people considered
undesirable. Police can use the system to track stolen cars, suspects,
illegal arms and forged money.

A POLICE inspector and his wife won a total of #10,500 damages from a
78-year-old widow yesterday. Anna Marsh, who insists on being called
Madame, launched a campaign against Inspector William Matheson, 50, and
his wife Rosemary, after their friendship soured.
She wrote to the couple's employers, their neighbours and the
procurator-fiscal claiming the policeman had persuaded her to alter her
will in his favour and conned her into a freebie holiday.
She also complained in her letter to Leslie Sharp, Chief Constable of
Strathclyde, that Mr Matheson, based at Lanark, had dressed scruffily
during the trip to Belgium.
But in awarding damages Sheriff Ian Simpson stated in a written
judgment at Airdrie Sheriff Court that her allegations were false and
were motivated by malice.
Mr Matheson, of Brownlee Road, Law, Lanarkshire, underwent a fruitless
year-long investigation by police disciplinary officers after Madame
Marsh's allegations.
He said during the case: ''It was one of the most difficult
experiences of my life.''
The inspector and Madame Marsh had become friendly through a shared
interest in cats and caravanning.
Madame Marsh, of Campbell House, Berryhill Road, Cumbernauld, even
altered her will to leave her motor home to Mr Matheson, when he offered
to look after her Siamese cats when she died.
The policeman offered to accompany Madame Marsh abroad where she
claimed she was going to exchange her motor home for a new one.
He said he did this because he was worried for her health. But he
became concerned about the friendship during the trip.
Mr Matheson told the court: ''She said that she needed to have a
10-minute period of prayer so that she could ask for the Almighty to
destroy her enemies.
''She said that as a result of that type of action at least two people
she knew had passed away. She said she thought of that as a punishment
for people who crossed her.''
Madame Marsh, who conducted her own defence in the action, was
criticised by Sheriff Ian Simpson. He said her arguments were long,
repetitive and irrelevant.
Madame Marsh's claim that Mr Matheson pressured her into changing her
will, was ''pure nonsense,'' said Sheriff Simpson.
He said Madame Marsh's claim that Mr Matheson had stolen a cooker from
her was also false.
Awarding Mr Matheson #8000 damages, Sheriff Simpson said: ''He
suffered two years of extreme distress as a result of the defender's
slander and defamation of him.''
Mrs Matheson was awarded #2500. Sheriff Simpson added: ''She suffered
unwarranted allegations concerning her honesty and integrity and,
embarrassingly, these allegations were made to her neighbours.''
Madame Marsh was prevented by court interdict from any further
slanderous behaviour towards the couple.
The sheriff will decide costs and a possible contempt of court by
Madame Marsh on March 30.

Alf Young, Economics Editor, argues that the Government is torturing
honest numbers into telling a story which will reflect well on its
policies
YOU must all be feeling better already. Inflation last month, as
measured by the Government's newest published indicator RPI(Y), was a
mere 1.8%, down from 1.9% in January.
Officially registered unemployment reached a four-year low in Scotland
in February and the Government's statisticians went a long way to
resolving an outstanding conundrum -- why month upon month of apparently
shrinking dole queues have not been accompanied by an equivalent surge
in the numbers of people in work -- by finding an additional 120,000 new
jobs across the UK, most of them in construction, all inexplicably
overlooked at the time.
The latest CBI survey of retailers painted a gloomy picture. But
within days Whitehall was telling us that February retail sales were
1.2% higher than in January.
Now we've been told that Britain's balance of payments deficit
virtually evaporated last year -- a mere #168m against #11,800m in 1993.
After all that it was no surprise to switch on BBC's Question Time on
Thursday evening to hear our own Secretary of State, Ian Lang, promise
that Scotland's economy will grow by 5% in each of the next two years.
Feeling good? Forget that killjoy Ken Clarke. I haven't felt this
bullish since it started raining, for the winter, some time last
September.
All these numbers churned out regularly by the Central Statistical
Office have an awesome power. They move markets. They prod Chancellors
and central bankers into raising or lowering taxes and the cost of
money. They are batted back and forth across the despatch box by rival
politicians in pursuit of superior economic integrity and savoir-faire.
The cost of living, as inflation used to be called, was once the
benchmark for annual pay claims. The length of the dole queues and the
size of our trade deficit have won and lost elections. The only
predictably ever-present items on some national television newscasts are
that day's movement in the FTSE 100, the main stock exchange index, and
the behaviour of the pound against both the German mark and the dollar.
But the really troubling question is this: does this sustained
statistical onslaught tell us something meaningful about the state of
the real economy? Do all these disparate numbers add up to a rational
picture of our collective economic existence? And, if they do and the
numbers are now all coming good, can the feel-good factor be far behind?
Take RPI(Y), now the Bank of England's preferred measure of inflation.
It not only excludes mortgage interest payments from the calculation.
The impact of indirect tax changes are dropped as well. It's just the
latest in a long line of alternative measures of the cost of living from
RPI minus food (too seasonal), through the tax and prices index (useful
when Mrs Thatcher was promising to get taxes down), to RPI(X) (the
headline rate minus mortgage interest).
You can see why Ministers and central bankers like it. To them, the
economy is that thing out there they are trying to control. They want to
know about price pressures in that outside economy so they can move
their own control levers accordingly.
But, for you and me, an extra 20 quid on the monthly mortgage payment,
thanks to three successive rises in base rates, or threepence on a litre
of petrol and VAT on the electricity bill, thanks to successive Budgets,
are additions, in real pounds and pence, to the cost of living,
indistinguishable from dearer vegetables, thanks to a bad harvest, or
pricier toys, thanks to the surging price of the raw polymer from which
the things are made.
When we try to make sense of the cost of living on our family budgets,
it's the headline rate which matters, not RPI(X), RPI(Y) or any other
devious derivative. In that regard, it was good to see the FT headline
its story yesterday: ''Higher mortgages push UK inflation to 28-month
peak.'' RPI(Y) didn't make its entrance until the tenth paragraph.
Official unemployment statistics have been treated to so many
revisions down the years that most of us have lost count of the changes.
As a measure of the real extent of joblessness in our economy I now
treat the official claimant count as, at best, a rough proxy for the
real position.
Our Government is better at counting the unemployed (or rather those
who  claim benefit) than enumerating those of us in work. That led to
embarrassing differences between the various counts of people in
employment and an unanswered question about why the thousands leaving
the dole queues were not swelling the ranks of the employed. That
question has now been answered by a statistical revision producing
120,000 additional jobs.
Error or fiddle? Who knows. But the integrity of all economic
statistics suffer as a result. Nor are they helped by Mr Lang's
prediction of 5% Scottish growth in each of the next two years. For a
start, the latest estimates of Scottish gross domestic product growth we
have are for 1992, published by the Scottish Office only last August.
The average annual increase between 1981 and 1992 was 2.1%. In that
context, two successive years of 5% GDP growth is, at best, political
moonshine.
Don't get me wrong. I happen to like numbers. I do not subscribe to
the view that trading in statistics is work fit only for knaves and
mountebanks. Blame the residual physicist in me, if you will, but I do
not equate statistics with snake oil.
That said, I am, thanks to the healthy scepticism bred into me by a
scientific education, wary of those who invest economic numbers with far
greater significance than they often deserve.
As Paul Ormerod pointed out in his book The Death of Economics, a
cricketer running to catch a ball does not need to be able to solve all
the complex differential equations necessary to describe its flight path
to catch it. Economists who purport, through their mathematical models
and number-crunching, to be able to predict the flight path of whole
economies are, usually, having us on.
Ormerod reports a 1993 University of Colorado study which examined 77
American macro-economic forecast series in the decade 1981 to 1991. The
researchers concluded that, of the 77, only two supported the idea that
the economic future could be rationally predicted in advance.
And yet the numbers still flood forth and City institutions pay their
economic forecasters telephone-number salaries to crunch, chart, and
choreograph them into supposedly rational conclusions. To paraphrase
Churchill, never was so much paid to so few to produce so little of
lasting substance.

DILLONS bookshop in Inverness is among the 20 casualties of a review
carried out by the chain's new owner, Thorn EMI, it was announced
yesterday.
Its doors closed for the last time last night, with the loss of 11
jobs, a spokesman said. The workers will receive their statutory
redundancy pay of one month's salary.
However, the stores in Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Stirling are to remain
open. They are among the 100 shops the company has decided to retain.
The music and rental group, which earlier this month bought Dillons
and other book stores from receivers for the Pentos Group, said 317 jobs
would be shed throughout Britain.
Thorn EMI's chairman, Sir Colin Southgate, said: ''The review
identified a number of high rent stores that failed to meet the criteria
required for the chain's successful future.''
He added that the level of rent being charged for the Inverness store,
in the town's Ingle Street, did not make economic sense.

YOU ARE not a pretty picture. You don't make much money but you know
how to spend it. You watch too much trash TV and you read a tabloid
paper. You're the one tearing up his slip in the bookie's after that nag
has let you down.
You're the one standing impatiently in the queue at the supermarket
truly believing that just six lucky numbers can change the world. You
don't think you gamble much but you'd probably bet on rainfall in the
Himalayas.
Thus far, Citizens' Advice Scotland says you are not presenting
yourself as one of its problems, but that might only be a matter of
time.
The Henley Centre for Forecasting says you are aged between 25 and 34,
earning between #9500 and #15,500 a year, and daft on the lottery. One
Edinburgh bookie, who wisely prefers not to be named, says you are ''a
born mug -- and a wonderful customer'' who thinks betting is as natural
as breathing. You are, if you didn't already know it, the Gambling Scot,
the National Lottery's best customer.
There is nothing special about the GS; most Scots would answer to the
name. In a report published this week Henley calculates, for example,
that 81% of the population of Scotland is playing the lottery against
odds which would get a casino closed down. American researchers
recognise you, meanwhile, as the second cousin of poor, inner-city
blacks spending scarce food money on foolish dreams. They believe the
day will not be long in coming when some of you turn up at Gamblers
Anonymous, thoroughly and expensively addicted to the ''light-hearted''
sense of ''national community'' that comes with a state-sponsored game
of next-to-no-chance.
The Americans add, too, that gambling breeds gambling; that when the
state sanctions gaming all bets are, psychologically speaking, off; and
that teenagers are the first victims. In Maryland, for example, a recent
study concluded that one in 20 adults was involved in ''problem or
pathological gambling'', prompting legislation requiring all state
lottery tickets to carry the warning ''Compulsive Gambling is a
Treatable Illness''. Sales were not halted or harmed.
Similarly a 1990 survey of 2700 high school students across four
states concluded that half gambled at least once a year; 13% financed
their gaming with crime, and 5% were ''pathological gamblers''. Most had
begun their careers with an innocent lottery ticket. Thus Valerie
Lornez, of the US national Centre for Pathological Gambling, is able to
claim that lotteries encourage young people to start gambling. She adds
that the hot-line at her Baltimore centre is dominated by lottery
addicts.
This proves nothing about Scotland, but a less scientific look at one
Edinburgh primary four class brought quick confirmation that ''almost
all'' the 30 children play the lottery, albeit with the assistance of
parents. One small shopkeeper, blessing the extra business the mania has
brought, admits that children, though barred from buying the tickets
themselves, are avid participants none the less.
In a middle-class part of Edinburgh he admits: ''We can't keep them
away.'' But why, in cold business terms, should the customers of the
future be discouraged? The truth is that no-one is clear about the
reasons why the Scots have taken to this new game in such a big way.
They have followed the pools and the horses for years, avidly but not
conspicuously, and they have been conditioned by newspaper bingo games,
but no more so than people elsewhere in the UK. Figures for gambling had
not, before Henley's research, isolated a uniquely Scottish dimension in
any case.
Pockets of deprivation may play a part, at least according to US
evidence, but the phenomenon of the poor paying a voluntary tax to
subsidise the cultural pursuits of the rich is not unique to Scotland.
The best bet (no pun intended) is that deprivation and the absence of
real cultural inhibitions have combined to give Scotland the game, if
not the winners, it has been waiting for.
Certainly the churches have made no real stand against the lottery,
perhaps because they know their flocks too well. In this, they merely
imitate their American counterparts, who grew coy about criticising
venal state lotteries when it was pointed out that they were making
hundreds of millions of dollars for their own ''good causes'' from
bingo.
It is plainly not the case, however, that Scots find nothing morally
repugnant about gambling. Too many working-class households have seen
the devastating effects of addiction to the dogs or the horses. Rather
Camelot, the lottery's organisers, have somehow managed to persuade
Scots in particular that their game is not gambling at all. With
everything to play for and nothing to lose, given the chance to buy a
whole new life on the cheap, Scots have flocked to the little blue
terminals.
America is still our best guide to what the lottery might hold in
store, however. Thirty years ago three US states had draws; now 37 run
them.
In 1992 Americans legally wagered $330bn -- an increase of 1800% over
1976. In 1995 they are expected to lose a cool $35bn, yet real social
benefits are still hard to identify -- hardly surprising since states
choose to use lottery income as a substitute for tax revenues rather
than as a windfall. In California, for example, a portion of lottery
profits is dedicated by law to education. This has not helped the
schools since, predictably enough, official education budgets have been
slashed since the game began.
The problem, if the American experience is anything to go by, is that
governments can just as easily become addicted to gambling as
individuals. Once hooked on easy revenue there is no going back, despite
some gruesome consequences.
Thus, when sales of the Michigan state lottery began to sag in 1977, a
new game was introduced. Entitled ''Daily'' it was based, unblushingly,
on the old numbers racket and targeted at inner-city Detroit, where
enthusiasm for the lottery had been highest.
Three hundred ticket machines were installed in liquor stores in poor
areas where spending on betting soon became proportionately much higher
among welfare recipients than among the prosperous. Or as the Rev Hames
Holley, a Detroit minister, was quoted as saying five years ago: ''The
state gives them money and then figures out a way to get it back. It's
the craziest thing I've ever seen.''
If any of that sounds familiar, that may be because hopelessness is
international. Some may play the lottery to transform their standard of
living; many Scots are hooked, it seems, because they have nothing left
to lose. This is not precisely what John Major said when he claimed that
''every man and woman in this country can be a direct beneficiary'' of
the game but it makes perfect sense in a rat-hole housing scheme.
Meanwhile, gambling is being described in the US as the ''Addiction of
the nineties''. In a country in which gaming was long associated with
organised crime, lotteries have made an old vice respectable and
ubiquitous. And as with Camelot's cheery and expensive campaign for its
contest, the American organisers attempt to portray lotteries as
innocent, acceptable, and above all normal pastimes.
In California, for example, a print ad for the game shows a kindly
rural shopkeeper hanging out his lottery sign while his dog sits on the
front porch and a school bus passes. That isn't how they buy tickets in
Watts or in Craigmillar, but in the US, lotteries are a $25bn business,
and the UK, with first-year sales expected to top #3000m, is not so very
far behind.
Yet there is no mystery, and no need for surprise. Desperation and
greed are potent in all human affairs; if social inhibitions fall,
people who would not be seen near a racetrack or a casino will have
their ''flutter''.
When Florida's roll-over jackpot reached $106m in 1990, retailers were
selling 44,000 tickets a minute in the days before the draw and
appealing vainly for calm. Having socialised gambling in Scotland by
turning ticket-buying into a national pastime in less than five months,
Camelot need only sit back and count its money.
What the phenomenon of the Gambling Scot tells us, perhaps, is that we
are far from being a contented people. Enthusiasm for miracles -- and
winning the National Lottery would meet most people's definition --
happens most often among the unhappy and desperate. Scots are not yet
notably addicted to gambling as such but they are, clearly, a nation
transfixed by wishful thinking. They want to escape their lives, and
that fact alone is all the comment needed about the nature of Scottish
society.
The phenomenon of the Gambling Scot can be viewed, if you like, in
reverse. Ask yourself what the reaction would be if the Government
announced tomorrow that there would be no more instant millionaires. How
many now would cheer? If gaming is a disease, Scots have become
incurable.
Regard the parables. In 1988 Sheelah Ryan was a 63-year-old New Yorker
living in a rundown mobile home and wondering where her next meal was
coming from. The next day the miracle had come to pass and she had won
$55.16m. Asked how she felt, she could, unsurprisingly, find no coherent
answer. ''This is the first time I've ever won $55m,'' she said.
Tonight, four out of five Scots will again be checking their six
numbers, forgetting addiction, problem teenagers, regressive taxation by
deceit, harsh lives, Camelot's profits, the ''good causes'' that mean
nothing to them, and the odds few can comprehend while they too wonder
just how it might feel.

CRYSTAL Palace fan Matthew Simmons pleaded not guilty yesterday to two
public order charges linked to the disturbance involving Manchester
United player Eric Cantona at Palace's Selhurst Park ground in January.
Mr Simmons, 20, from Thornton Heath, south London, appeared before
Croydon magistrates charged with using threatening, abusive or insulting
words or behaviour likely to cause immediately unlawful violence by
another person.
He is also charged with using threatening, abusive or insulting words
or behaviour within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused
harassment, alarm or distress.
He denied both charges.
Mr Simmons was bailed unconditionally to reappear before the court on
May 23 and 24.
The charges carry a maximum penalty of six months in prison and a
#6000 fine.
At the start of yesterday's hearing prosecution solicitor Jeffery
McCann sought a contempt of court order banning any reporting of the
proceedings against Mr Simmons.
But he withdrew the application after hearing representations from the
press.

Elizabeth Buie reports how scientists are divided over dire warnings
that the Antarctic ice-cap is melting
AS SCIENTISTS from Argentina say they have evidence that the Antarctic
ice-shelf is melting, delegates from more than 100 countries are
gathering in Berlin for the first Climate Summit to follow the United
Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.
The warnings from Dr Rodolfo del Valle, head of the earth sciences
department of Argentina's National Antarctic Direction, may well provide
added impetus to the Alliance of Small Island Nations who have most to
fear if climate change causes dangerous rises of the sea-level.
But just as some scientists' fears are becoming more pronounced, a new
backlash against predictions of an environmental apocalypse is growing,
not least in Britain.
This week, Dr del Valle said he had discovered a 40-mile-long crack in
the northernmost part of the Larsen ice-shelf that runs 600 miles up the
Antarctic peninsula. The cracking of the shelf was, he said, an even
more worrying sign of warming in the peninsula than the giant iceberg
that British scientists said broke off the shelf in January.
The significance of the Argentinians' discovery lies in the prediction
made by American scientists in the 1970s that the melting of
Antarctica's ice-shelf would be a clear signal of accelerating global
warming.
The earth's ice-shelves help insulate the continental ice-cap from
warmer weather, and while few scientists believe the entire ice-cap can
melt, even its partial disappearance could prove catastrophic.
The ice-cap covers the continent like a giant wedding-cake and is, on
average, 6000ft thick. It contains 70% of the world's fresh water and if
it all melted away would cause sea-levels to rise by 120ft to 300ft.
Measurements in the Antarctic peninsula show its average temperature has
risen by more than 2 degrees Centigrade since 1930, with about half the
warming occurring in the past 20 years.
The question exercising scientists now is whether this warming is in
line with historical trends, accounted for by solar activity, or whether
it is being caused by man-made action.
Dr del Valle thinks the warming may be taking place naturally, but
that greenhouse gases may be accelerating the process dangerously.
''I think the process is like a father pushing his child in a swing.
If the father pushes too hard the swing twists around, the child falls
down, and the game is over,'' he said.
However, while many nations will be advocating a ''precautionary''
approach at next week's conference -- that action should be taken now to
curb the growth of pollutants such as carbon dioxide -- others will be
insisting that global warming exists only in the imaginations of the
misguided.
A small, but very vocal group of British writers has recently started
to buttress the views of the so-called American ''contrarians'' who
claim that the public, media, politicians, and policy-makers are being
led by the nose by a bunch of hysterical millenarians.
Most prominent among the British contrarians are: Wilfred Beckerman, a
retired Oxford University economist who worked for the World Bank and on
the 1974 Royal Commission for Environmental Pollution; Richard D North,
a former environmental correspondent with the Independent and the Sunday
Times; and Matt Ridley, the scientist nephew of Lord Ridley and a Sunday
Telegraph columnist.
The contrarian view on resource exhaustion, for example, tends to run
along the lines that humanity has never yet run out of any natural
resource; on global famine, that while the world's population has
doubled since 1945, food production has tripled; on pollution, that
since 1972 the US population has risen 22% and the economy grown almost
60%, but air pollutants have not increased as expected; on the Antarctic
ozone hole, that it is little more than a localised phenomenon.
''As far as we are concerned, there is no evidence for global warming,
and by the year 2000, the man-made greenhouse theory will probably be
regarded as the biggest scientific gaffe of the century,'' said Mr Piers
Corbyn, astrophysicist at London's Weather Action forecasting
organisation.
But environmentalists who believe in the greenhouse effect say the
world is warming up because of carbon emissions from power stations and
cars and that this will lead to catastrophe as ice-caps melt and
low-lying areas of the world are inundated.
The Alliance of Small Island States, 36 nations which face disaster if
global warming does cause the predicted changes in sea-levels, will be
proposing at next week's Climate Summit that a legally binding protocol
be added to the Climate Change Convention agreed at Rio. This would
require industrialised countries to reduce their carbon dioxide
emissions by 20% from 1990 levels by the year 2005. Under the Rio
agreement, signatories are loosely committed to stabilising emissions to
1990 levels by the year 2000 -- a target seen by many as inadequate.
Friends of the Earth Scotland is expected to issue its own target for
cuts in emissions next week to coincide with the Climate Summit.
According to its estimates of what would be Scotland's fair share of
CO2 emissions, also allowing developing nations some room to increase
their emissions for a time as they industrialise, this country would
have to cut its emissions by 34% by the year 2010 and by 79% by 2050.
Friends of the Earth Scotland is expected to suggest that these
targets could be reached by strong investment in energy efficiency and
renewable energy, measures which would create jobs, but which would also
require some form of energy tax.
However, although from a global warming perspective nuclear power
generation has reduced the amount of CO2 produced by Scotland, Friends
of the Earth Scotland is unlikely to embrace this form of power
generation, given concerns about nuclear waste disposal.
Mr Kevin Dunion, director of FoE Scotland, said: ''The climate change
conference may be a crucial event for humanity. The world's governments
must not be allowed simply to congratulate each other and set a few easy
targets. Facing such potentially huge and irreversible changes, we
cannot afford to wait and see. We must take heed of the warnings of the
scientific community and pledge ourselves to challenging limits on
emissions.
''It is the developing world that will suffer first -- while we will
be busy building sea-walls and shifting sandbags, they will be drowning.
But climate change will be disastrous for everyone.''

ELECTRICITY bills for most householders in Scotland will go up next
week, despite the announcement last year by the industry's regulator
that price restraints would save Scottish customers #300m.
ScottishPower revealed yesterday that it is putting the domestic
tariff up by 1.8% from April 1, which will mean average bills going up
by more than #50 a year.
Professor Tom Carbery, chairman of the Southern Scotland Electricity
Consumers' Committee, said the rise was disappointing, and accused
ScottishPower of being too interested in its shareholders rather than in
the customers.
ScottishPower described the rise as a ''saving in real terms''. It
argued that, with inflation running at 3.4%, a rise of 1.8% was in fact
a reduction when inflation was taken into account.
The rise, though, will not help consumers who pay their bills with
Powercards. About 5000 families in the ScottishPower area regularly
suffer what is called ''self-disconnection'' by not having enough money
to buy the Powercards which they insert in their meters. The rise will
not reduce that number, Professor Carbery pointed out yesterday.
The tariff for small businesses in the ScottishPower area is not being
increased, which will be welcomed by the 100,000 small business
customers.
Hydro-Electric, which covers the north of Scotland, will not announce
any price changes until the autumn.
The electricity industry regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild,
reviewed ScottishPower's prices last September, and ordered the company
to give its customers an 11% saving over three years.
However, the company says that inflation has still to be taken into
account, which is why it says it can have an increase but still argue it
is on course to achieve the 11% saving. It is unlikely, though, that the
actual bills will ever be reduced in hard cash terms.
Professor Carbery, the consumer watchdog, said the main beneficiary
was the small business sector. ''When the Director General of
Electricity Supply conducted his review of the distribution and supply
business of the two Scottish companies last year, we estimated that by
1998 the drop in real price terms to the domestic customer would be
about 11%. Despite the latest tariff adjustments, that should still
happen, but we are disappointed with today's announcement.
''The see-saw of interest between shareholders and consumers is still
tilted much too severely in the interests of the shareholders. This was
not the reason for the privatisation of the electricity supply
industry.''
Making the price rise even more painful for Scottish consumers was the
announcement yesterday that customers in England and Wales could receive
lump sum payments of between #50 and #100 as Professor Littlechild is
considering further price curbs south of the Border.
Labour consumer spokesman Nigel Griffiths said it was vindication of
his party's long-standing claims that the privatised electricity
companies were making too much money at the expense of the public.
Scotland is not included, however, as it is felt that the review of
ScottishPower got it about right, while electricity companies in England
and Wales were dealt with too leniently. The review of Hydro-Electric
prices has gone to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for further
investigation.
Mr Bill Landels, ScottishPower's managing director of distribution and
supply, commented: ''Already since 1991 we have operated under tighter
price controls than the electricity companies in England and Wales, and
in that time our prices have come down by around 5% compared with the
cost of living.''

<HEADLINE>Army patrols are ended in streets of Belfast Up to 90% of the province has been cleared of mobile military presence</HEADLINE>

ROUTINE troop mobile patrols stopped in the greater Belfast area from
midnight last night.
Nearly seven months into the IRA ceasefire, streets in vast areas of
Northern Ireland are now without soldiers for the first time since
August, 1969.
As Sinn Fein and the Government try to agree a formula for the start
of exploratory talks between the two sides at Ministerial level, it was
disclosed last night that up to 90% of the province has been cleared of
a mobile military presence.
Belfast, Londonderry and virtually every major town are free of
troops. It is understood that another Army battalion is expected to be
pulled out at Easter as part of the developing peace process.
Apart from south Armagh, east Tyrone and some border areas of
Londonderry and Fermanagh where they have police back-up, all military
patrols have been halted.
There are no plans to close Army bases and if violence flares,
soldiers will be back on the streets again and stand-by troops based in
Britain ordered in.
Even though tensions have emerged with some of the loyalist
paramilitary factions in Belfast, confidence among security chiefs that
the ceasefires will hold was confirmed by this latest move.
Within 48 hours of 400 men being withdrawn from Tyrone and Armagh, the
assistant chief constable, Mr Bill Stewart, and the Army's senior
officer in Belfast, Brigadier Seymour Monroe, decided it was time to end
military patrols in the greater Belfast police area.
This stretches from Lisburn, just outside the city, to Antrim, further
north on the shores of Lough Neagh.
Daytime patrols have already stopped and troops are off the streets
completely in the city centre and east Belfast. It is not clear where
the battalion due to leave at Easter is based, but back-up for the
police will be maintained.
A statement said: ''Army support for the RUC will continue to be
available should this be operationally necessary.''
Unionists reacted cautiously, but one MP criticised the decision.
Mr Peter Robinson of east Belfast, deputy leader of the Rev Ian
Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party, said: ''What kind of a world do we
live in where terrorists keep their organisations intact, they hold on
to their arms and their ammunition and explosives and the Government
instructs the Army to demilitarise?''
Meanwhile, Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said he
regretted the conclusions of the Ulster Unionists who had explained why
they could not accept the UK-Irish framework proposals as the basis for
discussion.
However, he added: ''I applaud their readiness to discuss both with
the Government and other political parties ways of making progress to an
agreed, comprehensive settlement in Northern Ireland.''
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton issued a direct appeal to
paramilitary groups to give up their arms.
At a Dublin meeting of the Irish Government's National Forum for Peace
and Reconciliation, Mr Bruton declared: ''I will speak very directly to
those in the paramilitary organisations who still have stocks of guns,
which, by their own declaration, they don't have any use for, because if
they are committed to peace, these guns are no longer necessary.
''Please get rid of them. Please tell us that you are going to get rid
of them. Then everybody will feel more secure.''
Mr Martin McGuinness, head of the Sinn Fein delegation which has been
involved in exploratory talks with civil servants at Stormont, said the
British had never objected to the issue of demilitarisation in previous
meetings.
He said: ''Demilitarisation must therefore be part of the peace
process. How can we have an effective peace process which does not
include a discussion on demilitarisation? We need to deal with all the
conseqences of conflict.''
Mr McGuinness said no issues should be excluded from the talks.
He added: ''We will enter any discussions on the basis of our
electoral mandate. It is essential that this mandate is recognised and
the rights of our voters to equality of treatment is accepted.''

TOMORROW evening's launch of the BBC Scotland TV series Hamish Macbeth
will be boycotted in many homes in the very Highland beauty spot where
it was filmed.
For Sunday television watching in the village of Plockton and
surrounding area is taboo among staunch members of the Free Church, Free
Presbyterian Church and the Associated Presbyterian Church.
The antics of the offbeat policeman Hamish Macbeth will be screened
each Sunday for the next six weeks.
A BBC spokesman in Glasgow admitted yesterday: ''We must have
overlooked the Sabbath aspect when scheduling the programme. But we can
understand people's religious beliefs. Then he added: ''They will just
have to wait until this delightful series is perhaps re-shown on a
weekday.''
During three months of filming last autumn, production crews virtually
took over the Wester Ross village (population 300) renaming it Loch
Dubh.
Plockton's Free Church minister, the Rev Roddy Rankin, said yesterday:
''There's no doubt some people will choose not to watch the programme,
preferring to spend the time in more worthwhile worship. They will feel
it is not right to watch TV on the Sabbath. I'm sorry this is being
shown on Sunday.''
But he conceded: ''As for videoing it for watching it on Monday, it is
up to individual consciences. I will not be lambasting anyone from the
pulpit on Sunday about the use of videos.''
Local community councillor Mr Charlie MacRae found himself in the hot
seat yesterday. For he has a part in the series and is also a member of
the Free Church. With Macbeth in mind -- or was it Hamlet? -- he said:
''To watch or not to watch -- that's a good question.
''I'm sure there'll be quite a few who won't, because of their
religious convictions. But there has been a large influx of newcomers to
the village over the past few years.
''I'm in a bit of a conflict with my conscience over this. But I have
two teenage sons eager to watch the programme, and I'd be very unpopular
if I said no.''

PROFESSOR George Browning will return to clinical duties at Glasgow
Royal Infirmary on Monday for the first time since he was diagnosed as
being HIV-positive three months ago.
A leading ear, nose and throat surgeon, and professor of
otolaryngology at Glasgow University, Professor Browning will no longer
operate on patients or carry out other invasive procedures.
The medical director of the Royal Infirmary Trust, Professor Ross
Lorimer, said that Professor Browning would be involved in out-patient
clinics, ward rounds and teaching at the Royal and at Gartnavel General,
where his ENT surgery was previously carried out.
Flanked at a news conference in the Royal Infirmary boardroom by
Professor Lorimer, Dr Adam Bryson, the medical executive for Gartnavel,
and Dr Iain Symington, director of the Glasgow Occupational Health
Service, Professor Browning, 54, who has been on sick leave, said he was
delighted and thrilled to be returning to work.
''I have missed it considerably,'' he said. He admitted he was sad
that his medical role had been circumscribed, but added: ''There are
many other things I can do. I look forward to helping to train my
colleagues in the surgical role which will be passed to them.''
In an interview later with The Herald, Professor Browning said the
question of him entering theatre during operations to advise the
surgeons doing the work was still under investigation, but he hoped for
clearance to do this.
Dr Symington said the professor's return to work followed very full
consideration of all the medical issues relating to patient safety, and
he was satisfied they were doing the right thing.
''We are mindful of the fairly recent guidance from the UK Health
Department on the management of infective health-care workers,'' he
said.
It was the first case he knew of a health care worker returning to
work after being diagnosed HIV positive.
Professor Lorimer said that Professor Browning's return had been
discussed with hospital staff and had their full support.
''We do not think there is any risk to patients,'' he added. However,
any patient who did not wish to be treated by Professor Browning would
be offered an immediate apppointment with one of the registrars at the
clinic, or an appointment with another consultant in the near future.
This was reinforced by Dr Bryson, who said: ''It is fundamental that
patients are treated with their consent, and are entitled to withhold
that consent. No patient need have any health concern, or any grounds
for withholding consent, but it is understandable that a few may wish to
do so.''
There is no known instance worldwide of an HIV-positive surgeon
infecting a patient. However the health board took steps to inform the
700 patients operated on by Professor Browning over the past 10 years of
the situation.
About 500 people called the helpline, and Professor Browning said:
''The fact that there were as many calls from people concerned about me
rather than themselves is very gratifying.''
Professor Browning, who did not dispute reports that he was bisexual,
said he did not know how he had become infected. He was tested in
December following an illness, but he said: ''It wasn't that I went
along thinking I had HIV.''
He is married with two daughters, aged 23 and 19, and a son of 16, and
said his family had been very supportive.

<HEADLINE>Letter bomb sent to Scots cancer charity</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A SCOTTISH cancer charity last night attacked as ''malicious and
evil'' the people responsible for sending it a letter bomb.
The package was delivered on Thursday -- the same day an animal
stockman from Bannockburn, who was convicted of using excessive force to
control cattle, received a suspect package through the post.
Police have not ruled out a link between the two incidents.
Mr Derek Napier, chief executive of the St Andrews-based Association
for International Cancer Research, revealed the letter bomb had been
opened by a memeber of his staff.
The woman became suspicious and alerted the police.
Officers removed the packet and took it to forensic laboratories in
Dundee. A police spokesman later confirmed that the package had
contained an incendiary device.
Mr Napier, hit out at the would-be bombers, who are suspected of being
linked to extreme animal rights campaigners.
He said: ''We are a charity which raises funds for charity research.
Why anyone would want to target us is beyond belief.''
However, he added that several cancer research organisations had been
sent letter bombs in recent months and that staff at the charity had
been warned to be on the look-out for suspicious mail.
He said: ''We do keep an eye open for this kind of thing. The lady who
was opening it, sussed it out fairly quickly and followed all the
correct procedures. But I am furious that these evil and malicious
people should have put an innocent woman at risk.''
A suspect package was sent to the Bannockburn home of stockman John
Davidson, recently seen by TV viewers hitting cattle with a stick in a
film shot secretly by animal rights activists and later shown on the BBC
television programme Frontline Scotland.
Davidson later pled guilty at Stirling Sheriff Court to using
excessive force to control cattle at the Kildean Auction Mart in
Stirling and was fined #100.
The court heard the offence was low on the scale of animal abuse, and
there was no evidence any suffering had been caused. Police were called
in on Thursday evening, after Mr Davidson, 31, and his wife, Linda,
returned home from work to find the suspected letter bomb on the mat
inside their front door.
Detective Inspector John Anderson of Central Scotland CID confirmed a
package had been delivered to the house, bearing an English postmark.
It is understood Ministry of Defence bomb disposal experts removed the
package, although it is not yet known whether it was a bomb or an
elaborate hoax. No-one has claimed responsibility.
Police would not say if known animal rights activists were being
questioned, but an incident room has been set up at Central Scotland
Police headquarters.
The Director of Advocates for Animals, Mr Les Ward, condemned the
suspected letter bomb attack. He said last night: ''We believe human
life is just as important as animal life. We hope that whoever has done
this will be caught. Animal welfare will not be furthered at all in this
way.''

A DOCTOR caused a two-car crash after misjudging the power of a
minibus he was driving, Stirling Sheriff Court was told yesterday.
Consultant paediatrician Armit Sarmah, 46, had hired the vehicle to
give his in-laws from India a tour of Scotland, but he ran out of road
while overtaking on the A84 near Callander.
Procurator-fiscal depute Robbie Brown said two oncoming cars were
forced to swerve on to the grass verge to avoid the minibus, which was
coming straight at them. In their desperate bid to get out of the way
they collided, but the minibus drove on without pausing.
Dr Sarmah, of Abbotsbury Road, Hayes, Kent, admitted careless driving
and failing to stop after an accident.
Fining him #400, Sheriff Richard Macfarlane said: ''This was at the
high end of the scale for careless driving.'' He also ordered Dr
Sarmah's licence to be endorsed with eight penalty points.

CALEDONIAN MacBrayne yesterday confirmed it had placed an order for a
#2.2m car ferry, for the Sound of Harris, with a Merseyside yard.
McTay Marine, in Bromborough, which has already built CalMac ferries
for the Fionphort/Iona and Claonaig/Lochranza services, beat three
Scottish yards for the contract.
CalMac's managing director, Mr Colin Paterson, said he was
disappointed that he could not place the order with a Scottish yard, but
they had not been competitive enough.
He said the firm hoped to take delivery of the ferry in April next
year, with the service in operation later in the month. ''She will be
able to carry 18 cars on what is a new route between Leverburgh in the
south of Harris to Otternish in the north of North Uist.''

THREE teenage girls were warned yesterday that they could face jail
sentences, after being convicted of robbing the actress and model Miss
Elizabeth Hurley.
A jury at London's Southwark Crown Court dismissed their claims that
only a fourth girl, who had already pleaded guilty, carried out the
crime.
Judge Gerald Butler, QC, adjourning the case until April 12, warned
the girls: ''I have in mind a custodial sentence.''
But the girls' relatives complained they had received harsh treatment
because their victim was a high-profile celebrity.
Christina Guerrine, 18, of Bethnal Green, east London; Carlene Irving,
18, of Shepherd's Bush, west London; and Tamara Flowers, 17, of
Stratford, east London, had all denied robbing Miss Hurley of #10 and
some photographs.
The fourth girl, Helen Danso, 17, of Bethnal Green, pleaded guilty on
Wednesday. All were remanded in custody.
Miss Hurley, 29, who has a multi-million pound contract with the
cosmetic company Estee Lauder, flew to the US with her actor boyfriend
Hugh Grant on Thursday, after giving evidence.
The prosecution claimed the girls robbed Miss Hurley at knifepoint
last November as she walked alone to the home she shares with Mr Grant,
star of Four Weddings and a Funeral, in Kensington.
Miss Hurley told the court on Wednesday that one of the girls held a
six-inch knife about an inch from her stomach. She gave them #10, but
one of them sneered: ''Is that all you've got? That's not enough. We
can't even get some Big Macs with that.''
She escaped when she ran into the road and waved down a passing van
driver.
The jury reached its unanimous decision after retiring for an hour.
Angry relatives of the girls later criticised the verdict. One, who
refused to give her name, said: ''They got convicted because it was Liz
Hurley. Who does she think she is, anyway?''
The girls' solicitor, Mr Jonathan Cummins, said: ''It was a fair trial
and there is no question of an appeal.'' He said he would be seeing the
girls again to arrange mitigation.

A ROAD safety campaigner last night demanded stricter penalties for
offending motorists after another driver was convicted of travelling at
around twice the legal limit.
Accountant Jeffrey Meek yesterday admitted driving his Porsche at
130mph on the M9 and was fined #400 and given a two-month driving ban at
Linlithgow Sheriff Court.
His plea of not guilty to dangerous driving was accepted by the court
and he admitted careless driving.
Earlier this week, car salesman Charles Young, 27, of Penicuik, was
fined #250 and banned from driving for six months at Peebles Sheriff
Court after he admitted driving dangerously in a Mercedes at speeds of
up to 143 mph.
Ms Isobel Brydie, chairwoman of the Scottish Campaign Against
Irresponsible Drivers, said it was ridiculous that ''thrillseekers''
were being let off lightly by the courts.
She said: ''The court should never have accepted Meek's plea of guilty
to careless driving. They should have gone for dangerous driving where
the penalties are much greater.
''Travelling at over 100mph for a considerable distance is not a
momentary lapse in attention. Driving at this kind of speed is dangerous
and the courts should recognise that.''
Meek's solicitor, Mr Alistair Duff, told the court that his client
flashed past a stopped police car on the M9 in July last year.
He added: ''The police were attracted to the make of car. He was well
into the distance when they got under way. I don't think they got
anywhere near him.''
Meek, 32, of Old Edinburgh Road, Linlithgow, was finally caught when
he was forced to slow down after he left the motorway at Newbridge.
Outside the court, Meek said he would be selling his #20,000 Porsche.
He said: ''I'll get something the police are less likely to follow.''
However, he denied he had been let off lightly by Sheriff James
Penman. He said: ''The ban was a bit longer than I might have
expected.''

MINISTERS were yesterday fighting off charges from the Tory right that
its legislative programme for the next Parliament ''lacked beef''.
Mr Michael Portillo, the Cabinet's leading right-winger, said that the
core proposals, agreed on Thursday by Ministers, set out a distinctive
agenda for the run-up to the next General Election.
However, Mr Edward Leigh, a former Trade Minister and a leading Tory
critic of the Prime Minister, said the lack of radical proposals showed
the Government had lost its populist touch.
Labour leader Tony Blair said the announcement of the measures -- at
least three months earlier than usual -- was a ''panic measure'' by a
Government without energy or direction.
Mr Portillo, though, insisted that the measures agreed -- including a
new clampdown on bogus asylum seekers and vouchers for nursery education
-- emphasised the clear differences between the two parties.
''It does emphasise that what the Government wishes to do is to ensure
that we have an entirely distinctive programme which continues to carry
forward the things that Conservatives believe in,'' he said on BBC Radio
4's the World at One programme.
However, there was a clear sense of disappointment among the Tory
right who want Ministers to counter Mr Blair's drive to seize the
political centre ground with a radical package to put some ''clear blue
water'' between the two parties.
There was particular disappointment that, with the decision not to try
to resurrect the Post Office sell-off, there would be no high profile
privatisation in the programme.
Mr Leigh said that, if the Government had produced a more dynamic
package, it would have distracted attention away from the sex scandals
and Ministerial resignations besetting the party.
''It could do better in terms of more radicalism and more beef,'' he
added.
The other bills in the programme include criminal justice legislation
to tighten up the rules on the disclosure of evidence to defendents; a
partial relaxation of the rules on media cross-ownership between
television companies and newspapers; measures to control the cost of
legal aid; an end to ''quickie'' divorces; and new powers for the Health
Service Ombudsman.

<HEADLINE>Climbers are warned on avalanche risk</HEADLINE>

HUNDREDS of climbers are expected to take to the Scottish mountains
this weekend, amid renewed avalanche alerts and warnings of freezing
winds, gusting at more than 100mph, on the mountains by Sunday.
Rescue team leaders are bracing themselves for a busy couple of days
as fresh mountain warnings are posted throughout the Highlands.
A spokesman for the Scottish Avalanche Information Service said
yesterday: ''The avalanche hazard is increasing all the time . . . there
will be large deposits of unstable snow and windslab in many mountain
areas.''
In Glencoe, the Northern Cairngorms and Aonach Mor, near Fort William,
the risk of avalanche is likely to be ''considerable'' today and
tomorrow, with the highest danger in gullies above 2500ft.
Cairngorm mountain rescue team leader John Allen, said he would be on
24-hour stand-by this weekend.
He said yesterday: ''We are aware of the danger. Cornices will be
collapsing and shooting down gullies all over the place.
''But while there are still great winter climbing conditions up there,
you can be sure the mountains will be packed with people.''
Mr Allen added: ''I would urge climbers to stick to mountain areas
where the avalanche risk is obviously low.''
Mr Douglas Yule, of Weather Watchers, based in Castle Douglas, said
yesterday: ''Climbers should expect the worst.
''Saturday will see snow showers and a strong, fresh westerly wind.
Sunday will turn very much colder, with heavy blizzards blasted by gusts
of over 100 mph. You wouldn't catch me up there.''
Scotland's two western ski resorts, Glencoe's White Corries centre and
Nevis Range at Aonach Mor were storm-bound yesterday, with winds
reaching 80 mph.
Both centres had good snow cover and hope to open today.
The three more easterly resorts, at Cairngorm, the Lecht and Glenshee,
were open yesterday. About 1000 hardy skiers braved heavy sleet showers
which turned to snow later in the day.
These centres also predicted they would open today and about 10,000
revellers are expected at Cairngorm Chairlift Company's annual fun
''Snow Festival', which ends tomorrow.

A MOTHER yesterday praised the courage of a lollipop lady who jumped
in front of a car to save her child after a collision in Glasgow.
Mother-of-three Ms Angela Paterson, 24, with 12-month-old daughter
Helen Moody, sons Paul, six, and James, two, were standing with
patrolwoman Mrs Christine Mackie, 57, waiting to cross the city's
Carntyne Road on the way to school.
There was a collision between two cars at the junction of Carntyne
Road and Glencorse Street, following which one of the vehicles careered
out of control and mounted the pavement.
Mrs Mackie dived in front of Ms Paterson's pram, suffering two broken
legs and a broken arm. She was last night ''stable'' in the city's Royal
Infirmary.
Ms Paterson and daughter Helen were treated for bruising and shock
before being released. Both drivers were treated for shock and whiplash
injuries and then released.
Speaking from her home in Carntyne last night, Ms Paterson said: ''If
it was not for Mrs Mackie two of my children would be dead.''

NURSERY education dominated the local election campaign yesterday with
the Scottish National Party and the Scottish Liberal Democrats both
promising more pre-school places.
Mrs Margaret Ewing, the SNP's Parliamentary leader, speaking in
Glasgow, said the party had a long-standing commitment to nursery
education for three and four-year-olds, unlike the Government, which,
she claimed, had allowed services for pre-school children to slip to the
second worst in the European Union.
''It is a scandal that Scotland's children are languishing at the
bottom of the Euro-league for nursery provision, putting them at a
disadvantage right at the start of their education,'' she said.
The SNP points out that in Grampian, where the SNP is involved in the
administration, six new nursery units have opened in the last year, and
in SNP-controlled Tayside region, additional resources are promised in
the next year.
At a news conference in Edinburgh Mrs Ray Michie, the Liberal Democrat
MP for Argyll and Bute, attacked the Government's ''duplicity'' for
pledging increased nursery places, while at the same time cutting
councils' financial resources.
''With further real term cuts in local spending planned, the crisis in
education can only deepen,'' she said.
''While some authorities have acted to preserve nursery education, it
is inevitable that pre-school provision will suffer. Expansion will stop
and cuts may have to be made in some areas.''
The Liberal Democrats would invest a penny of income tax in education
and extra money for nursery education would be their top priority, she
said.
The party aimed to provide places for every three and four-year-old
whose parents wanted it. Liberal Democrat councils had already acted on
this pledge, she said.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party in Renfrewshire has been split following
the disciplining of five sitting councillors.
Three councillors have been expelled and two others suspended after
three Labour Renfrew district councillors, bitter at not being nominated
to stand as official candidates for the new Renfrewshire single-tier
authority, decided to stand as Independents against the official party
nominees.
Councillors Richard Manser and Paul Mack put themselves forward as
''Labour'' candidates in the Huntershill and Sandyford Wards, despite
not being officially endorsed. They are the only ''Labour'' contenders
for the two seats.
Councillors Elsie McFaull, Ken McGinley, and Bobby Stevenson, are also
in trouble with the party chiefs for opposing adopted candidates.
Labour Party spokeswoman Maureen Smith said: ''Bobby Stevenson, Elsie
McFaull and Ken McGinley have debarred themselves from membership of the
party through their actions.
''Paul Mack and Richard Manser have been suspended pending a full
investigation.''

<HEADLINE>Exhausted teenagers found safe after 17 hours lost in lime quarry tunnels. Escape from the labyrinth</HEADLINE>

THREE Scots teenagers were rescued yesterday from a labyrinth of
underground tunnels after their search for adventure went dramatically
wrong.
They emerged after 17 hours, exhausted and dirty but physically
virtually unscathed, from disused lime workings having been found by
mine rescue volunteers who had combed the dark passages running under
the Fife countryside.
The youths, Graham McBride, 15, Wayne Allan, 17, and Ronnie Thomson,
19, all from Kennoway, later praised their rescuers and told how after
getting lost and breaking their only torch they had wandered the maze of
tunnels stopping occasionally to sleep.
One of those who had been involved in the rescue operation said: ''You
could lose an army in there and it would take another army to find
them.''
It later emerged they were found in an area that had been searched
several times indicating the extent of their travels in the underground
honeycomb.
Last night Fife police and the Mine Rescue Service indicated they
would be taking measures to minimise the dangers that can occur from
open entrances to disused workings.
Assistant Chief Constable Andrew Mathieson said both organisations
would be raising the issue of sealing the entrances with the landowners.
One of the mine rescue workers said they were surprised the entrances
had not been closed before. ''We would not, in the mining industry, be
allowed to leave something like that open.''
He said the youths were very lucky and could have been lost for a very
long time. The teenagers were fortunate because the temperature
underground was reasonable and no gases were involved in the system.
The teenagers had gone out around 9.30pm on Thursday to the remote
Cults Hill limework quarry, which has not been worked for a number of
years.
The trio went down into a gully and entered through an entrance above
which someone had painted the words ''The Black Hole''.
Army cadet Wayne later told how one of them had been carrying a torch
but this had been broken in a fall. ''It was dark and pretty cold in
there and I was pretty scared.''
Two friends who had also gone to the area but did not enter the mine,
which is known to have had roof-falls and been affected by water in the
past, became worried and raised the alarm.
Mine rescuers from Crossgates and Longannet in Fife went to the area
and teams of two immediately began a search leaving messages at
different points in the grid system of tunnels indicating to the youths
help was at hand.
After 17 hours one of the teams came across the exhausted youths and
brought them to safety from an entrance 600 yards away from the orginal
point of entry.
Relatives who had waited anxiously for news hugged them as they were
brought out.
Mr John Allan, Wayne's father, said they had gone to the disused mine
''just for adventure''.
''It's brilliant they're out and I have the utmost respect for their
rescuers.''

<HEADLINE>Scots warned of 20p tax rise Major raises the  cash stakes in devolution row</HEADLINE>

THE Prime Minister warned yesterday that income tax rates in Scotland
could soar after devolution to as much as an extra 20p in the pound if
current levels of public spending were to be maintained.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, on a visit to Edinburgh to boost the
Tories' local elections campaign, also made one of the most scornful
attacks yet by a senior Minister on Labour's plans for a Scottish
Parliament.
He described it as ''fanciful nonsense'' and ''a silly idea -- a sop
to the Nationalists''. He admitted later, however, that if it were ever
established the Tories should not boycott it. They should stand for
membership and he forecast that a lot of them would get elected.
Under Labour's present plans a Scottish Parliament would be limited to
imposing an extra 3p in the pound, which the Prime Minister said would
cost the average family an extra #6 a week.
But the Government calculates that at present Scotland receives #603
per head more public spending than the UK average, equivalent to #3087m.
The Inland Revenue reckons that an income tax increase of 1p in the
pound would yield #150m in Scotland.
If the #3087m shortfall were to be funded from income tax alone, the
rate would have to go up by more than 20p in the pound.
In a Commons written answer, Mr Major said: ''I have no intention of
introducing a Scottish Parliament which would undermine the integrity of
the Union and make Scotland the highest-taxed part of the UK.''
His answer pointed out that if public spending in Scotland were
reduced to the UK average the shortfall would be much more than could be
covered by the current planned tax limit on the devolved Parliament of
3p.
He said: ''The proponents of a Scottish Parliament should have
calculated the cost to taxpayers in Scotland before they committed
themselves to its introduction.''
The timing of the written reply appeared to be part of a combined
operation against Labour's devolution plans spearheaded in Scotland by
Mr Clarke, speaking to industrialists in Edinburgh, and Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang, who was visiting Dundee.
The Chancellor said that if a devolved assembly were set up in
Edinburgh many English taxpayers ''would undoubtedly expect more of this
higher public spending in Scotland to be raised in Scotland''.
In any event, he said, the 3p limit proposed by Labour was ''a wholly
arbitrary figure''. It would only be a matter of time before the
assembly asked for power to levy any amount of income tax it chose.
''The result would inevitably be that every Scottish taxpayer would
wind up paying more tax on their wages than every English taxpayer on
the same rate of pay. If that put pressure on Scottish pay rates to go
up that would make Scottish business less competitive than business in
the south.''
Mr Clarke referred to ''the chilling prospect'' of the effect a
socialist-dominated Scottish executive would have on potential foreign
investors who in the past five years had created or protected nearly
50,000 Scottish jobs.
The world class financial centre of Edinburgh would undoubtedly be
destabilised by any move towards an independent Scotland. ''Investors
outside Scotland would, I am sure, at least think twice about investing
money in the financial capital of an independent state with a new
central bank and an executive run by socialists and nationalists.''
Mr Clarke said the Scottish economy contributed to the UK economy
''and I believe the rest of the UK economy assists the performance of
the Scottish economy''. He added: ''No-one will persuade me that
devolution does not have its roots in the appeasement of Scottish
separatism.''
The West Lothian question was one that would not go away either, he
said, and Labour leader Tony Blair ''had taken leave of his senses'' if
he thought the question was no longer an issue. He gave two examples
which he declared would ''incense the voters of Middle England''.
They would not sit quietly by while Scots MPs at Westminster voted on
the contents of the English National Schools Curriculum or on
appropriate sentences for crimes committed in England while English MPs
would have no say in the equivalent subjects for Scotland.
Mr Clarke added: ''I know the Scots are a proud people. They are a
nation but they do not need to try to prove it in the modern competitive
world by pursuing devolution or full independence.'' The Union for which
the Conservatives stood was based on its members' mutual respect and
mutual self interest.
Mr Lang warned in Dundee: ''The Union would be under threat from a
devolved Scottish Parliament. There would be an intrinsically unstable
relationship between Edinburgh and Westminster and some politicians
would be working assiduously to undermine the Union at every turn.''
A Labour spokesman said the Prime Minister's 20p figure was absurd. It
was based on the assumption that Scottish public spending would be
reduced to the UK average, but, under Labour, spending would be on the
principle of equalisation based on need rather than on the tax base of
any particular area. ''Therefore public spending in Scotland would not
fall to the UK average and there would be no need for any increase in
Scotland.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said the Chancellor was
showing his ignorance of Labour's plans which would give a Scottish
Parliament power to cut income tax by up to 3p in the pound.
''Scots won't pay 1p more in tax unless they vote for it and it's a
bit rich for Ken Clarke -- the man who has raised taxes by 7p in the
pound when he said he would cut them -- to come up to Scotland and start
telling lies about Labour's programme.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said Mr Clarke's attack on Scottish
independence was further proof that the Tories were running scared of
the Nationalists.
The Chancellor, he pointed out, had no experience of running a
business.

CHANCELLOR of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke last night was celebrating
Britain's best balance-of-payments performance since 1985.
A huge upsurge in the investment income of British companies with
overseas operations was largely responsible for a deficit on the current
account last year of just #168m, well below the #4000m forecast by the
Treasury at the end of November and a huge improvement on 1993's
#11.8bn.
The strength of invisibles -- earnings from City services, travel, and
investment -- produced a surplus on the current account of #628m in the
final quarter of last year after one of #1367m in the third quarter.
The traditional surplus on invisible trade rose from #1549m in 1993 to
#10.4bn last year. Britain's export-led recovery made a more modest
contribution to the sharp fall in the deficit, as did a one-off #900m
drop in transfers to the EU at the end of the year.
The Chancellor said living standards were set to rise for years to
come.
''By the end of the year, output was over 4% higher, unemployment over
a third of a million lower, investment in manufacturing was up by more
than 8% and the current account had returned to surplus,'' he added.
The balance-of-payments figures were much better than the City had
expected and helped give a much needed boost to sterling, which gained
over a pfennig against the German mark.
Mr Clarke told reporters in Edinburgh on a local election campaign
visit: ''If we keep on course and ignore the foolish advice of our
opponents, then Scottish and British industry over the next years,
probably the remainder of the nineties, will steadily deliver rising
prosperity and secure jobs.''
Asked when the ''feelgood factor'' might take effect, he said: ''What
happens if you get people accustomed to living in a healthy modern
economy is they steadily feel a sense of greater prosperity, greater
security, greater self-confidence because Britain can hold its own in
the modern world.
''My job as Chancellor is to keep taking the decisions that produce
the climate in which we can get this good news, and for people
themselves to decide when they start feeling cheerful about it.''

TORY chiefs are believed to be battling to prevent a back-bench MP
from being declared bankrupt, which would mean his resignation and
another probable by-election loss for the Government.
The MP, whose name is being kept a closely-guarded secret by a few
leading figures in the party and the Government whips, is understood to
be facing combined business and gambling debts of more than #100,000.
The MP is understood not to be a ''new boy'', elected for the first
time in 1992.
Speculation has centred on two, one from the Midlands the other from
the West Country who have been rumoured to be in financial trouble. The
MP's difficulties do not arise, said one source, from losses on Lloyds.
Rich party members have helped out colleagues in difficulties before,
one case being that of Mr Harvey Proctor the former MP for Billericay,
but with the party organisation itself in financial trouble with debts
of more than #16m few may be willing to help shoulder this personal
debt.
Mr Major's majority is currently 13, but could fall to 11 if it loses
the Perth and Kinross by-election and the vacant North Down seat is won
by a Unionist uncommitted to supporting the Government.
Wealthy Tories reported to have assisted colleagues before now include
former Trade Minister, Mr Tim Sainsbury; President of the Board of Trade
Michael Heseltine; Treasury Minister Jonathan Aitken; and Mr David
Evans, a 1922 Committee executive member, who made a fortune in business
before becoming an MP.
Labour MP Andrew Mackinlay tabled a Commons question asking whether an
MP who receives a gift or loan to prevent his disqualification from
Parliament would have to declare it in the Register of Members'
Interests. The Thurrock MP said he believed it was declarable.
''Such a gift or loan is intended to affect voting in the House of
Commons, and manifestly so, in a particular direction,'' he said.
