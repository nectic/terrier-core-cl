IN the purpose-built environment of the SECC it is easy to forget how
hand-knitted the arrangements for the earliest motor shows in Scotland
sometimes turned out to be.
The first motor and cycle exhibition in Scotland -- from which this
year's Diamond Jubilee show dates the start of its history -- was held
in 1897 in Edinburgh's Waverley Market, which also played host to the
next few in the series.
There was the ridiculous situation that, on a pre-arranged day, all
the exhibits had to be cleared away to allow the capital's fruit and
vegetable sellers to set up their once-a-week stalls.
In 1995 we are unlikely to have a repeat of the incident when a car
was actually started up on one of the stands. The exhibitor leaned over
to make some adjustment, and sent it bounding uncontrollably away. It
cannoned off one nearby vehicle and came to an embarrassed halt crashed
into another.
Once the fledgling Scottish Motor Manufacturers and Traders'
Association (today's Scottish Motor Trade Association) took over the
show, it became a much more business-like affair altogether, and
thoroughly justified its new title as the national motor show.
Until the First World War, most of the shows were held in Edinburgh,
although the original organisers missed a year in 1902, when there was a
rival exhibition in a Glasgow drill hall, and the official show came
West for a one-off visit in 1912.
The post-war shows, however, were established from 1920 in Glasgow's
new Kelvin Hall. Unfortunately, the architect had been rather vague
about ventilation arrangements in the low-roofed building, and the
atmosphere was choking. After a few days on duty, the people manning the
stands would say to one another, ''Wouldn't it be wonderful if this
place just burned down?'' Coincidentally or otherwise, it did.
In 1925 the show had to return briefly to Edinburgh, where the
Industrial Hall was equally uncomfortable, although in a different way.
One magazine commented: ''It is not true that an unpleasant smell on
Monday was traced to the thawing corpse of a visitor frozen to death on
Friday morning.''
The present-day Kelvin Hall, with all its roof-level towers and
twiddles, was ready by 1926. The Scottish Motor Show came back, and was
held there until the SECC opened in 1985.
While things are much more sensibly arranged now, on the group-stand
basis, a snag with many of the Kelvin Hall shows was that different
dealers in the same make might set up rival stands. Once, there were
eight examples of the same model dotted around the hall.
And there were occasional organisational glitches. One exhibitor
turned out to be the proprietor of a children's roundabout, complete
with blaring music. He refused point-blank to remove it, on the grounds,
so the story goes, that ''there are wee caurs gaun' roon', aren't
there?''

AS the Diamond Jubilee motor show, this year's is naturally the 60th
in a series which started in 1897. But the long-time organising body,
the Scottish Motor Trade Association, came on the scene in 1903.
That was when the principal firms in the Scottish motor industry --
manufacturing, coachbuilding and retail -- formed themselves into what
was at first the Scottish Motor Manufacturers' and Traders' Association.
John Stirling of Hamilton, whose company was the first one in Scotland
to make a profit out of importing and marketing cars, was the first
president. Earlier, he had been the first motorist to drive a car along
what is now the M74 route to Carlisle, and made a two-day journey to
London as early as 1899.
Stirlings opened the first car showroom in Glasgow, that same year, at
a Sauchiehall Street address which, until not long ago, had a dip in the
pavement edge, showing where the 19th-century salesmen would move their
stock of cars in and out from the street.
Other figures and firms involved in the original SMMTA included Harry
Prosser and Andrew Rennie, whose family names are still in the Glasgow
motor trade; A C Penman, whose Dumfries coachbuilding company built
bodies for Albion and Arrol-Johnston; and Albion itself, established in
the last days of 1899 and, although long since out of the car and
commercial vehicle building business, a flourishing component maker
heading for its century.
As the Scottish motor manufacturing industry faded out, the
association renamed itself simply the Scottish Motor Trade Association.
Its offices in Palmerston Place, Edinburgh, have a dozen staff involved
not just in the biennial Scottish Motor Show, but also in making sure
the SMTA remains the public face of the Scottish retail motor trade.
It keeps an eye on garage and showroom standards, and all the
legislation about consumer interests, health and safety at work, and so
on. It lobbies government and other public bodies, deals with training
matters, and can be called upon in any disputes between its members and
their customers.
Currently, there are about 1100 member firms in the SMTA. Most of them
are in the retail trade all over Scotland -- there are flourishing
centres in Orkney and Shetland. Some members have associate status. The
associates include service and supply companies, as well as most of the
motor manufacturers and importers. That is how, for example, a company
like Daewoo, which has no conventional retail network, is able, thanks
to its associate SMTA membership, to exhibit at the SECC.
Current president of the association, serving the usual two-year term,
is George Watt, of the Harper Motor Company in Aberdeen. He can trace
his company's history back to late Victorian times. More than that, its
founder John Harper and his chief mechanic Thomas Mowat built not one
but two pioneering vehicles in Aberdeen. The Harper and the Mowat may be
footnotes in motoring history, but the link with the early days is
there.

IN its simplest form a car is a self-propelled vehicle used for travel
on land. Its fundamental structure consists of seven basic systems: the
engine, usually mounted in front and driving either the two front, two
rear, or all four wheels; the fuel system, using a carburettor or some
form of fuel injection to produce the optimal combustible mixture of
fuel and air; the electrical system, including a battery that provides a
power source to the ignition; the cooling, steering and suspension, and
braking systems; and the transmission, which transmits power from the
engine crankshaft to the wheels by means of a series of gears.
Or, to put it even more simply, it is for most people first and
foremost a saloon; all other derivatives arrived later and are simply
variations on the common three box theme.
Saloons haven't had so much a bad press recently as virtually no press
at all. The current fashion for MPVs, coupes, sports cars and 4x4s has
all but masked the fact that the saloon remains the mainstay of the
motor industry in this country.
At the SECC we will be treated to an unprecedented number of new and
reworked saloons on which the fiscal hopes of various manufacturers are
firmly pinned.
The 1996 Mondeo, best-selling UK saloon, is mentioned elsewhere, but
most of the show attention looks like being hogged by Vauxhall's
Cavalier replacement, the Vectra.
Vauxhall knows the Vectra must succeed if the company is to retain its
position as Ford's only real challenger in the British volume car market
and the depth of models up for inspection reflects this.
Five trim levels and a choice of six engines are on offer and Vauxhall
say the Vectra's chassis concept promises to make it one of the most
comfortable and best-handling cars of its type.
It uses a multi-link rear axle with both front and rear systems
mounted on subframes, insulated from the body to reduce engine,
transmission, tyre and road noise.
Elsewhere engines are simultaneously more powerful and produce better
fuel economy -- no mean feat, while both active and passive safety
features abound.
All in all the Vectra has set new benchmarks by which every other
mainstream saloon coming on the market over the next year or two will be
judged -- and it looks like being a hard act to follow.
But some of the Glasgow exhibitors are more concerned with
establishing a presence here rather than simply chasing volume sales.
Count among these Chrysler and Suzuki, who pitch in with two brand-new
cars, the Neon and Baleno.
Chrysler retreated from the UK in some disarray some years ago when
the company's North American parent was in danger of sinking, but has
now bounced back, encouraged by the runaway success of the Jeep
Cherokee.
Now the Neon is in the spotlight and the first models for sale are
expected to arrive in June next year. Over 270,000 have already been
sold in the US, so the car will be well and truly ''sorted out'' for our
consumption.
Although fairly compact it is powered by a beefy two-litre,
four-cylinder 16-valve engine developing an impressive 131bhp. Range
toppers will come fully loaded, with air conditioning, central locking,
electric windows, cruise control and alloys all part of the package.
A company spokesman said gear ratios have been altered to suit
European tastes and he also promises easy access courtesy of larger than
average doors, together with ''class leading'' interior room. In fact
there is 98% of the space offered in the much larger Ford Mondeo, so
full marks to Chrysler's design team for some clever work with their
pencils.
Suzuki is normally thought of in Scotland as a minor league player,
but the Japanese concern does have modest expansion plans for the UK.
Its SECC display may be one of the smallest, but it is none the less
interesting for that.
The little Cappuccino sports car was a big hit in 1993 and the Baleno,
while not so visually compelling, is still well worth a look.
A 1.8-litre saloon, it features a brand-new 121bhp 16-valve power unit
and lots of advanced technology, including four-channel, four-sensor
anti-lock brakes, twin air bags, suspension control system and plenty of
electronics. Another car due to arrive in 1996, it is as yet unpriced.
Look out too for Hyundai's new Lantra. It will be offered from
December with a choice of 1.6 or 1.8-litre power and it borrows some
styling features from the Accent, launched this time last year.
BMW buffs (and who would want to miss the latest Three and Five series
models), will be catered for once again by Lanarkshire dealer Douglas
Park, long-time supporter of the show and a man not afraid to dig into
his own coffers to avoid disappointing his customers.
With new-to-Scotland cars from Rover, Renault, Proton and others, the
old grumble about manufacturers giving the event scant attention hardly
stands up.
Very few have opted to stay away this year and, quite frankly, it will
be their loss. The Scottish Motor Show, oversubscribed again this year,
is too big to be concerned with the odd truant.

DOUBLED first-quarter profits from British Sky Broadcasting were ahead
of expectations and the shares jumped 16p to 386p, writes CHRISTOPHER
SIMS.
Fuelled by new subscriber growth, profits rose from #24.4m to #50.8m
in the three months to September. The subscriber list grew by 214,000 to
4,380,000 and the group believes its strength in movies and sports
coverage is fuelling the growth.
''Our sports line-up on Sky is spectacular . . . and we now have
virtually the entire output of Hollywood,'' declared finance director
Richard Brooke.
BSkyB outbid terrestrial broadcasters for coverage of FA Premiership
Football and has recently broadcast the Ryder Cup and two world title
boxing fights.
All this cost money and programming expenses were up 34%, making up
the bulk of operating costs of #148m, a rise of 37%. The Disney channel
was launched last month and six further channels on November 1,
including the controversial, soft-porn Playboy TV. This brings the total
to 28 channels.
Chief executive Sam Chisholm said: ''We enter the peak pre-Christmas
selling season with our best-ever line-up of entertainment, sport and
new channels.''
Operating revenues were 37% ahead at #214m, with subscriptions
accounting for 85%. About 57% of subscribers take all the premium
channels, which cost extra.

COMPUTERS
BOB Beaty, who has been head of IBM's computer factory in Greenock for
two years, will retire in January.
His replacement will be Ian Crawford, 41, another Scot, who for the
last year has been director of logistics process re-engineering at the
headquarters of IBM's PC division at Raleigh, North Carolina.
Mr Beaty, 52, is Greenock born and bred and has spent most of his 27
years with IBM at the group's Scottish plant.
This employs about 3000 people and is the company's main manufacturing
centre for personal computers sold in Europe, the Middle East and
Africa.
Mr Beaty said he was leaving of his own accord and had not been
pushed, adding that he had been working very hard and wanted to slow
down a bit.
''To run a place like this successfully you have to commit yourself
110% to it and that's exactly what I have done, working seven days a
week,'' he said.
Mr Beaty has no plans to slip into idle retirement though. He would
like to be more active in the Scottish Electronics Forum and on the
board of Renfrewshire Enterprise as well as in promoting links between
Scottish universities and industry.
At the same time he is considering the offer of a visiting
professorship at Glasgow University and several proposals to become a
non-executive board member of other companies.
Mr Crawford, who replaces him, has several years experience at the
Greenock plant, where he is well known.
David Hoyte, IBM's general manager for the manufacturing, distribution
and procurement of personal computers, said that in addition to running
Greenock he would provide business direction to IBM joint ventures in
Russia, Israel and South Africa.
''The strong manufacturing and logistics experience which Ian brings
is particularly relevant to his new and challenging position,'' he said.
Mr Beaty said IBM Greenock had weathered a difficult time in the
computer industry and was headed for record orders in the fourth quarter
of this year.
''I think we are well on the upslope now and things are looking quite
good,'' he said.
Mr Beaty does not envisage any switch in focus away from personal
computer manufacturing at Greenock, but he predicted the plant would
continue to enrich its manufacturing role with more research and
development and customer service facilities.
Earlier this year IBM sited a multi-lingual telephone help centre
covering the whole of Europe in Greenock.

Scottish Opera's former music director John Mauceri is now pursuing a
successful career in the United States. But despite this and his
disappointment over the circumstances of his departure from Scotland, he
tells Ruth Wishart that he still feels for the company and is concerned
about its future
THE study of his New York apartment groans with musical memorabilia,
photographs with the Queen entertainingly juxtaposed with snaps of his
long-time mentor and friend Lenny Bernstein; shots of wife Betty and son
Ben alongside some of the starrier friends in his firmament.
But there's still room on John Mauceri's shelves between the Tony and
Emmy awards for some peculiarly Scottish mementoes of his life and times
as the musical director of Scottish Opera: framed hand-written
instructions for checking out his kilt length, a printed card from the
Old Course Hotel advising him that conditions would be rain with cloud
plus wind.
Whatever his relationship latterly with the Scottish Opera management,
and there's much of that over which he prefers to draw a discreet veil
(which doesn't quite mask the disappointment), he still retains
affection for the company and real concern for its future.
''I was always proud of working with a company which took its
responsibilities to the country so seriously. I loved the commitment it
had to things like Opera Go Round and a host of civic initiatives which
you just didn't get from companies in England.''
He's followed from a distance the current shenanigans, and,
interestingly, shares the view of his successor that neither dispensing
with the in-house orchestra, or using the services of other existing
bands is really in Scottish Opera's long-term interests.
''OK, you can see why a music director would say that, because without
an orchestra he has nothing much to direct! But a national opera company
has three building blocks: an administration which has to get the
finances and the structure right, its orchestra, and its chorus. The
chorus has benefited greatly from having an enthusiastic chorus master
and is in great shape. And when I left the orchestra was also in great
form.
''Now maybe you could have a guest orchestra for the Edinburgh
Festival but it would be difficult for the rest of the time. Not just
because of scheduling problems though when the company went down that
road before with the SCO and the SNO that proved a major headache. But
the fact is that your own orchestra knows the repertoire when you're
doing revivals, it knows the acoustic in the venue, and consequently it
actually saves money in terms of things like rehearsal time.''
Its much-criticised under use, he suspects, may be a partially
self-inflicted wound in that it was not encouraged to do too much in the
run-up to the proposed merger with the BBC SSO in order to make the case
for that scenario more persuasive.
But in any event he thinks comparisons with set-ups like Glyndebourne
are on the whole pretty odious. ''You can't compare getting in outside
orchestras for what is effectively a season with sustaining a national
opera company which Scotland deserves.''
He thinks the part-time scenario may be less damaging than many of us
fear, given that there was a history of summer breaks and that the
audience might not notice that so very much. But he concedes that
putting people on shorter-term contracts is an easy way to lose the best
talent to other offers.
More generally he identifies part of the funding difficulties in a UK
context as the reluctance to think in terms of raising more funds
privately. ''I understand that people worry that if they get money from
elsewhere they may lose government support. But as an American I'm not
uncomfortable with looking to other sources more often. I think, for
instance, that we could have got sponsorship to complete the Ring cycle
if there had been a willingness to have a dialogue with people who had
expressed an interest. But that's history now.''
What isn't history is Mauceri's passionate crusade against musical
demarcation lines. Just as his Glasgow years found him interspersing
Bernstein with Verdi in the much-acclaimed Candide and his sumptuous
Forza del Destino, his debut with the New York Philharmonic this month
was an intermingling of straight orchestral pieces with film scores . .
. complete with giant screen playing the relevant scenes from movies
like Ben Hur, Madame Bovary and the original Robin Hood.
His three nights at the Lincoln Centre were a central part of what he
calls his ''missionary journey'' to restore the reputations of emigre
composers like Miklos Rozsa, and Erich Korngold who were first feted by
pre-war Europe for their symphonic talents and then scorned by the great
concert halls and opera houses for their apparently unpardonable sin of
writing film scores.
The richness and interchangeability of those talents was underscored
at these New York concerts by the way Mauceri programmed the evening,
Korngold's Symphonic Serenade followed by some rollicking Robin Hood,
and Rozsa's arresting Theme Variations and Finale rounded off by Bovary
and Ben Hur.
Entirely new territory for the notoriously conservative New York Phil,
and rapturously received by the New York audience.
To John's huge delight, Rosza, then 88, visited the Hollywood Bowl for
the recording that orchestra made of his work last year, just before
Rosza's death. When they replayed the tape in the studio a faint throaty
''bravo'' was on it, the blind composer's spontaneous tribute. At John's
insistence, the bravo remains on the disc.
His two recording companies threw a joint supper party for him in New
York, evidence of their delight at his selling power. He makes five or
six recordings in the year, taking huge delight in continuing to
challenge accepted wisdom about what constitutes good music. The summer
months are spent in Los Angeles conducting a Bowl orchestra which was
created for him four years ago, and which kept him out of the clutches
of Boston who seemed set to lure him to their Pops orchestra last year.
The rest of the year finds him on a circular tour which takes him
regularly to Italy and Berlin, will find him on one of many trips to
Japan over Christmas, and more recently took him to Leipzig where he
made his debut with the radio orchestra. He and Betty arrived home in
New York to find a message from Andrew Lloyd Webber asking him to come
back to London immediately to record the film soundtrack of Evita with
Madonna. They clambered aboard Concorde, he made the recording, and they
hurled back to rehearse with the Philharmonic for last week's concerts.
The more you reflect on all of which, the more you wonder if Scottish
Opera knew what they had, and knew what they let go.

PAPERMAKING
INVERESK, the Dunfermline-based paper manufacturer, has agreed to buy
Weir Paper Holdings, which operates a paper factory and a wastepaper
recycling company in Alloa, for #20.6m.
Inveresk will also assume responsibility for up to #12m of Weir
Paper's debt.
Managing director Stefan Kay said the main aim of the acquisition was
to give Inveresk access to Weir Paper's wastepaper recycling plant.
This will enable the group to cut its consumption of virgin wood pulp,
control its cost base and start commercial sales of recycled pulp.
Control of the adjacent Kilbagie Mills paper factory will boost
Inveresk's production capacity and give the group access to new
customers, especially in Continental Europe.
Weir Paper produced 39,000 tonnes of printing and writing paper last
year and exported 17% of its output to continental Europe.
The company made a pre-tax profit of #1.4m on turnover of #34.5m.
Inveresk is purchasing Weir Paper from Australia's Pratt Group, which
is pulling out of fine paper manufacturing to concentrate on its core
business of paper and cardboard packaging.
It is Inveresk's first acquisition since it was floated on the Stock
Exchange in June 1993 and is due to be earnings enhancing in the first
full financial year.
Mr Kay said the Alloa paper factory and recycling plant will be
integrated with Inveresk's existing Caldwells paper mill 15 miles away
at Inverkeithing in Fife under a single management structure.
Both plants produce similar types of fine paper which are used for
books, writing paper, office stationery and industrial product labels.
Between them they will absorb up to 80% of the bleached pulp from the
Alloa recycling plant.
Mr Kay said 25 to 30 jobs in administration and sales would be lost
when Alloa and Caldwells are placed under a single management, but this
represented a small proportion of the combined staff of 530.
''We are not talking about taking the knife out,'' he said.
Weir Paper's recycling operation, set up last year at a cost of #10m,
produces 70 tonnes per day of de-inked pulp.
This will rise to 80 tonnes per day by the end of 1996 and Mr Kay said
some of this output would continue to be sold on the open market.
The key advantage of the recycling operation is that it uses waste
paper collected free of charge from contracting companies and local
authorities.
This avoids the need to buy in waste paper from commercial contractors
at prices that fluctuate wildly from #70 to #250 per tonne.
Pulp and paper prices have soared over the past year, but Mr Kay said
they had now peaked and would probably stabilise.
''We have certainly come to the current peak of the paper cycle,'' he
said. ''but we see a stabilisation rather than a sharp reduction of
prices.''
Mr Kay said Inveresk was on course to improve on last year's
performance, when the group made a pre-tax profit of #8.1m on turnover
of #101.2m.
Inveresk owns four paper mills in addition to its new acquisition in
Alloa. Three are situated in central Scotland and one at Wells in
Somerset.
Mr Kay said Inveresk, a small specialist paper manufacturer, was still
on the lookout of other acquisition opportunities.
''We are always interested in high quality specialist paper mills,''
he said.
Inveresk shares closed up 3p at 187p after announcing the Weir Paper
deal.    The shares are usually lightly traded since ownership is
tightly concentrated in the hands of directors, managers, employees and
a handful of institutional investors.

NATIONAL Power has lifted its interim dividend by 24% to 5.4p on the
back of a 20% rise in profits to #254m in the 27 weeks to October 1.
The actual cost of the dividend is 14% higher, the difference being
due to the share buy-in earlier this year. Dividend cover is scheduled
to fall to 2.5 times by next summer. The better trading performance
reflects continuing gains in efficiency, with staff productivity rising
17%, reflecting a 13% fall in employee numbers to 4854.
National Power's sales volume was up 3% in the six months but this was
partly because the comparable period was a week shorter. Market share
slipped from 32% to 30% as competitive pressures increased, though the
fall was in line with expectations.
Sales through the wholesale pool fell by 4% and unit output prices
were down 6%. Direct sales to large customers were up 6% at #293m, and
sales of gas and by-products were also higher.
On the operating front, National Power said its plant performed well
and emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides continued to fall
because of the Drax desulphurisation project and a growing proportion of
output coming from gas turbine plant.
Commissioning of the delayed Little Barford plant will now take place
early next year, while Didcot is on schedule, as is the plan to burn
orimulsion in the Pembroke plant. Total capital spending came to #140m.
The group said a new organisational structure had been put in place
which would enable resources to be used more effectively.

SPIRITS, retailing, and brewing group Allied Domecq yesterday left the
City wondering what would happen next after it revealed 12-month figures
in line with expectations but with little to say about the future.
There was relief that there was no dividend cut as had been feared by
some analysts. The group announced an effective 6.3% increase and a
12.8p final for the 18-month period to August. However, there was no
indication of what moves had been taken to resolve the succession with
many expecting chairman Michael Jackaman to stand down soon in favour of
Sir Christopher Hogg.
The shares closed unchanged on the day at 493p.
Pre-tax profits for the 12-month period before exceptional charges
were held exactly at #635m. But this time there was a #90m
reorganisation charge of which #6m related to changes at Allied
Distillers where about 200 people are leaving Dumbarton in both
production and marketing out of a total Scottish spirits workforce of
about 2000. That in part reflected the need to make changes to working
practices to meet a more volatile global market for Scotch.
Pre-tax profits after exceptionals declined 21% to #494m on turnover
7.7% greater at #6051m.
The spirits division overall made profits of #501m a record level and
puts Allied Domecq fairly into second place in the global league.
Ballantine's continues as the major money spinner with the brand being
heavily supported although there are some excellent long-term profits
being developed the US market.
Allied is trying to force up the price of Teacher's in the domestic
market -- it achieved a greater net gain last Christmas than either
Bell's or Famous Grouse and that is sorely needed to enable distillers
to obtain an adequate return.
But pricing in almost all markets continues to be sticky with even
keeping up with inflation in markets where there is concentration of
retailing extremely difficult.
In hindsight, the timing of the Pedro Domecq acquisition could not
have been worse. Profits of #129m announced in August have since been
undermined by the continuing depreciation of the Mexican peso. That
country brought in #48m profit for the year but that is now worth just
#23m.
The bulk of the reorganisation costs, amounting to #60m relate to the
Carlsberg-Tetley associate. In that division, the Warrington brewery is
being closed with 500 job losses. Carlsberg-Tetley saw its profits
contribution slump from #75m to #47m despite selling beer to the Allied
pub estate at prices well above the UK average. There was a one-off hit
of #3m because of a failure in Tetley widgets which led to a recall.
In retailing, the pubs benefited from rising food sales. There was
further improvement at Victoria Wine thanks to the integration of
Augustus Barnett and possibly the clearest marketing strategy within the
whole group. The Baskin-Robbins ice-cream and Dunkin' Donuts franchise
systems also helped profits.

The multi-purpose vehicle has a gathering interest among those looking
for extra space, James Currie reports
ONE of the fascinating things about the motor industry is its
never-ending ability to inspire, create and direct new fashion trends.
Perhaps not to the wasteful extent of the United States in the fifties
and sixties when every car in every range had to be dramatically changed
once every year. Not for them a new number plate. Americans asked for --
and got -- cars so markedly different that Mr Jones was left in no doubt
that his neighbour had splashed out a lot of money.
If the pace of change has slowed just a little, the capacity of the
industry to come up with fresh ideas remains a powerful force in the
market place.
Hence the current emphasis on MPVs. call them people carriers,
recreational vehicles or whatever, but not vans with windows. These
cars, for the most part, have been designed from the ground up to drive
and handle just as well or better than any saloon.
One notable exception which can be seen at the SECC is Daihatsu's
cheap and cheerful little Hijet people carrier. Unashamedly van-based it
is nicely upholstered and will carry seven people with ease. It also
costs around half the price of a dedicated MPV, which makes it perfect
transport for the large family operating on a small budget.
Even so, it is the products from the mainstream European companies
that are set to dominate what they claim is a market that will
experience steady growth over the next few years. Doubters should note
that Ford has sold 137,000 Windstars in the US this year, the Windstar
being a Galaxy with a 3.8-litre engine fitted, and that MPVs currently
occupy four out of the top 10 places in that country's best-seller list.
The UK Galaxy was launched earlier this year, quickly followed by the
Volkswagen Sharan and (in Spain) the Seat Alhambra.
These three vehicles are the result of a joint VW/Ford cost-sharing
exercise and are built by the same people, in the same factory, on the
same platform, but thereafter go their different ways.
And the differences are more than just a matter of giving each car an
individual nose and badge. The Ford Galaxy, which starts at #16,440 for
the 2-litre Aspen, provides driving characteristics and interior
furnishings that will ring a bell with any previous owners of the
Scorpio.
Likewise VW, whose own 2-litre entry model, the Sharan CL, costs
slightly less. The German company has gone for slightly different ride
characteristics -- and again the detail in the passenger compartment is
reassuringly VW.
Seat's Alhambra, the third of this trio, wasn't originally scheduled
to be a contender in the British market, but Seat has been encouraged by
the interest generated by the whole MPV concept and has given it the
role of flagship model for its entire range of vehicles.
All three vehicles have doors which open and shut just like those in
''normal'' saloons and hatchbacks, which is where they differ from the
rival products from the Fiat/Citroen/Peugeot stable.
Yes another triumvirate, in this instance producing the Fiat Ulysse,
Citroen Synergie and the less imaginatively named Peugeot 806.
This group has opted for sliding doors at the sides, pointing out that
these are more functional (and safer when being opened in busy streets).
Operating them is a simple enough chore, easily accomplished with one
hand, but the ageing process could see some rattles and squeaks
manifesting themselves.
Two engines are offered: petrol and diesel, with the latter being
particularly powerful and flexible while returning commendable fuel
economy.
A useful feature is the ''walk through'' cab, which has the gear lever
mounted off the floor and positioned just at the bottom of the
dashboard, allowing the driver easy access from either side of the car.
The Fiat Peugeot and Citroen vehicles are good value and cost rather
less than those from Ford and VW. The most expensive of the newcomers is
the Honda Shuttle, ownership of which means being prepared to write out
a cheque for almost #24,000, but if it is less practical than its rivals
it is also one of the best equipped and is hugely comfortable -- just
the machine for that leisurely tour of the Continent.
And these are just the newcomers, to be joined at the show by
established favourites such as the Toyota Previa and Renault Espace,
both of which have been spruced up to meet what promises to be a stiff
challenge to their market leadership over the next few months.
Something slightly different? That's the US-built Voyager on
Chrysler's stand. They call it a caravan in America, but here it
qualifies as a luxury people carrier.
So if you are tired of the sardine effect induced whenever you climb
into the faithful family hatchback and can afford the price of a
reasonably specified medium saloon, take a look at the new MPVs.
They've got it all -- especially space.

ONE type of vehicle with which the Scottish Motor Show is well stocked
is the often maligned 4x4. Many critics wonder why it should attract
people who have rarely, like Tam o' Shanter, ''skelpit on through dub
and mire''.
But that is to miss the point about the 4x4. For many owners it is not
so much an off-roader as an all-purpose car. And motorists who need the
capabilities of a 4x4, even occasionally during the year, do not have to
pay any heed to remarks that they are just a bunch of poseurs.
Apart from the usually rugged build -- except in the case of a few
lightweight ''recreational'' types -- there are four main attractions of
the 4x4, some of them particularly appropriate in Scotland at this time
of year.
First of all, even the models which are not designed and equipped to
batter their way up Ben Nevis are able to cope with almost any kind of
off-tarmac use to which an owner interested in outdoor pursuits will put
them. Trips down to fishing stances at a riverbank, or on to a grouse
moor, or over rough tracks to the start of a climb are usually easy for
them.
Secondly, if a farmer, or a civil engineer, or somebody involved with
building sites during the week can afford only one vehicle for working
as well as for family or sporting use, a 4x4 will play both roles.
Thirdly, and this is something constantly forgotten by writers who
moan about 4x4 buyers, many of these owners are not interested in going
off road, but they have a trailer, boat, caravan, racing or rally car,
maybe even a glider to tow. And there is simply no normal saloon car
which will do that as well as a hefty 4x4.
Lastly, in winter conditions a 4x4 has the traction to keep going on
snow and ice which might be quite dodgy for an ordinary car to tackle,
and its high ground clearance makes it able to cope with flooded roads
which would strand something more ground-hugging.
In winter, a 4x4 with ABS braking is one of the most secure-feeling
vehicles on the road. Its virtues outweigh any drawbacks such as heavy
fuel consumption.
At the SECC there are examples of 4x4s, petrol and diesel, which are
proper workhorses, as well as others which are just as happy on the
school run or being loaded up for the holidays.
The range of engine capacities, performance levels, accommodation and
price is quite remarkable. While some 4x4s are pretty rough and ready,
others are sophisticated in engineering and appearance.
Some of these 4x4s are closely related or, indeed, the same vehicle
rebadged. The Nissan Terrano and Ford Maverick are two sides of the same
coin, just like the Isuzu Trooper and Vauxhall Monterey. Vauxhall's
Frontera also has Isuzu origins, although its Japanese counterpart has
never been marketed here.
Japanese manufacturers export 4x4s all over the world. Toyota has an
extensive range from the RAV4 in three-door and five-door styles, via
the workaday 4Runner to the massive Landcruiser. Suzuki's V6 engine
transplant in the Vitara was one of its best moves of 1995, and it is
also showing the little X-90 4x4 which will be added to its range next
year.
The Mitsubishi Shogun has been aimed from the start at country types,
backed by substantial promotional investment in events such as horse
trials. With a different market in mind, the Daihatsu Fourtrak is a real
work machine, while the smaller Sportrak is intended more for hobby use.
SsangYong of Korea has come strongly into the UK market with the
Mercedes-powered Musso, while a much more basic 4x4, due to be revised
early in 1996, is the Russian Lada Niva.
Chrysler Jeep has done well, since January 1993, in establishing the
Cherokee on the UK market. The much bigger Grand Cherokee, on show at
the SECC, goes on sale here next year after selling more than
half-a-million units in the US.
The agreed top-prestige car on the 4x4 scene, however, remains the
Range Rover in its various models up to a 4.6-litre. A size and price
bracket lower, the Discovery still manages to be partly a ''lifestyle''
buy.
The lines and basic design of the original Land Rover can still be
seen in the Defender. Modified and to some extent refined over the
years, the Defender is still recognisable as a direct descendant of
Britain's first volume production 4x4, designed and marketed in a hurry
in 1948.

A DEFINITION of luxury cars is not easy to arrive at. While the top
models in some ranges which include more pedestrian versions do arguably
break into the category, there is no doubt whatever about the cars which
are there on merit.
It is not just a matter of price. There is a certain atmosphere about
a luxury car which mutton dressed as lamb will never achieve, but it is
fair to say that not much under #20,000 has any hope of even being
considered.
Several mainstream manufacturers, the bulk of whose profits come from
small and medium-sized cars, feel the need to nudge into the luxury, or
at least the upper executive sector of the market. Some make a pretty
good job of it, others are there only on sufferance.
Part of the problem may be that the manufacturing company's top
management, and the dealer principals in its retail sales network, often
want a prestige car with the badge of the make they are involved with
prominently displayed.
There are several cars of this type whose continued production could
hardly be justified by anybody who took a cold look at the financial and
sales figures. But there may be some benefit in marketing a car which is
some kind of loss leader in prestige terms.
The main British-based companies all specify and price their top
models in the luxury car sector. Ford with the upper level Scorpio,
Vauxhall with the similar class Omega, and Rover with the highest
specification 800 are all involved.
On the Continent, much the same role is played by the top-priced
versions of the Citroen XM, the Saab 9000 in turbocharged or V6 trim,
and the Volvo 960-series. Japan weighs in with the top model Nissan QX,
the Mazda Xedos 9 and the higher-priced Honda Legend.
It may be possible to make a case that, if #20,000 is the gateway
figure for the luxury class, anything costing more than twice that
amount is definitely in the upper bracket. At the SECC, only five makes
qualify, and they come from three different countries.
Toyota made a conscious effort to move into this part of the market
when it created its Lexus subsidiary and threw technology at the new
marque. The two GS300 models, one a recently arrived Sport, are there to
give the Lexus network a wider spread of cars to sell. But it is the
LS400 which represents the company's best shot at top-class engineering,
lavish technical specification and on-the-road refinement.
The appearance of a BMW at the show was not certain at the time of
writing, but if one is on display it may be an example of the 7-series.
These three-litre, four-litre and 5.4-litre saloons are Munich's finest,
both in appointments and in impeccable engineering.
With the appearance this summer of the long wheelbase models, Jaguar
has consolidated its position in the luxury class. The 12-cylinder
engine may be coming towards the end of its production life, but to sit
behind a six-litre V12 is one of the grand experiences of motoring.
Although no longer a separate make, but the top model of Jaguar
saloon, the Daimler in Double Six form revives the name of the royal
cars of the era of George V and Queen Mary. And Daimler's appearance in
the catalogue keeps alive the memory of a British make which celebrates
its centenary in 1996, even though its name came from the original
German patent holder.
At the pinnacle of the luxury car class, certainly in price, elegance
and lavish interior appointments, come Rolls-Royce and Bentley.
Recently, it has been fascinating to watch the resurgence of Bentley as
a separate model range. This is a far cry from the situation when
Bentleys were simply Rolls-Royces without the famous flying lady mascot.
At the SECC, Rolls-Royce is represented -- in addition to the original
1907 Silver Ghost -- by the latest Silver Spirit III. There is a
definite split in intentions in Crewe's marketing strategy, with
Rolls-Royce being aimed more at the straight luxury market, and Bentley
being more performance orientated.
So one of the Bentleys at the show is the Turbo R. The other is the
magnificent Azure convertible, about which not much more need be said
than that customers are showing no signs of baulking at its showroom
price of #215,000.

A number of cars that are making an appearance at the show are not yet
in the showrooms, Ross Finlay looks at some examples
MORE than ever before, this year's Scottish Motor Show features cars
which may have been mentioned in the press but have not yet arrived in
the showrooms They go on sale after the show, in some cases as long
after it as the autumn of 1996.
From the exhibition organisers' point of view, of course, this is an
excellent development. There is no way of seeing most of these cars, for
the moment at least, without going along to the SECC.
In some cases, the new models are visually much the same as before,
but have uprated engines, or enhanced trim and equipment levels. That is
what happens in the normal pre-planned schedule of keeping the
specifications of any range up to scratch.
Other manufacturers, though, are showing completely new cars, not
improved versions of existing models. Either that, or their 1996
offerings have radical technical changes.
Taking them alphabetically, make by make, there are three Alfa Romeos
due for launch next year. The 145 Cloverleaf -- more exotic-sounding in
Italian as the Quadrifoglio -- will go on sale in mid-February, while
the eye-catching GTV and Spider are expected a couple of months later.
Chrysler Jeep Imports, a subsidiary of the Inchcape group, is bringing
in new models in three quite different categories. The Jeep Grand
Cherokee arrives in February, the Illinois-built Neon saloon in June,
and the Voyager MPV, assembled in right-hand drive form at Graz in
Austria, next October.
Latest in the line of Citroen Xantia developments, the Activa comes
with one of the world's most sophisticated computer-controlled
production car suspension systems. The UK launch is timed for around the
New Year.
Fiat's almost-matching Brava and Bravo models are replacements for the
Tipo. Three and five-door models go on sale late next month.
Of all the new cars, the one which will be highest up the best-seller
lists is the latest series of Ford Fiesta. After a long pre-launch
publicity programme, it will go on sale later this month.
Honda is ringing the changes, as it has done regularly during the past
few decades, in its Civic range. On display at the SECC, the latest
three-door and five-door models go on sale in January.
Biggest of the Korean companies, which expect to make a much greater
impact world-wide by the time the new century starts, is Hyundai. The
1996 model-year Lantras which replace the existing line will be
available later this month.
Built in Holland, the Mitsubishi Carisma has been delayed in
right-hand drive form and will now go on sale in the New Year. A
possible future production development is on display at the SECC, in the
form of the striking ''evolution'' model restyled and to some extent
re-engineered by Tom Walkinshaw's Oxfordshire-based TWR design.
The long-serving Peugeot 405 saloon is being replaced by the 406.
British journalists have tested French-specification cars, but
right-hand drive examples will be here early in January.
Renault is showing an example of the Megane, the model which replaces
the 19. It is having a two-part introduction to UK showrooms, the
hatchback due in April and the coupe in May.
Rover's new 200, which caused such an impact at last month's London
Motor Show, goes on sale in December. The 400 four-door saloon range
will be in the showrooms next spring.
Suzuki's new-model programmes always cause some puzzlement in
Scotland. The little X90 recreational vehicle, on show at the SECC, is
likely to be on retail sale some time early in 1996.
The 850-series Volvos are building up in number, and high performance
versions are now taken for granted. A volume production version of the
limited-run T-5R which astonished the company by the number of people
who rushed to buy it, the 854R has an even higher power output. Like the
new 850TDI, it goes on sale in January. The brand-new S4 range, perhaps
with a different model name or number by that time, will not be
available till June.

AT the press launch of one new car, an English journalist objected to
the use of the word ''estate'', on the grounds that few people these
days are actually landed proprietors in any significant way.
Station wagon is another description which may not be entirely
appropriate, but it is difficult to imagine just what politically
correct label could be put on a type of car which is handy, even in
these days of fold-down seats in smaller hatchbacks.
No hatchback matches an estate car for carrying volume. Apart from
MPVs, only estates can find space for a third row of seats. And they are
often purpose-built for the job, with not just extended bodywork but
also, in some cases, revised suspension settings or layout, as well as
automatic self-levelling.
There is also the case of the estate car as a luxury item rather than
pantechnicon. The BMW Touring is the prime example here, and Rover
continues with the original 400 Tourer. Estates appeal to people who
sometimes have to transport holiday or sporting kit around, need a cargo
space for their business journeys, or just make occasional forays with
bags of garden refuse in the direction of the nearest tip.
So there are estate cars of all sizes, prices and technical features,
depending on just what role they are expected to play. Many
manufacturers do little more than a body job, others have dedicated
estate designs.
Ford offers estate car versions of the Escort, Mondeo and Scorpio.
Vauxhall does the same with the Astra and Omega, and in time will begin
selling a Vectra estate. Peugeot's 405 estate continues despite the
imminent arrival of the 406 saloon. The new Hyundai Lantra is shown at
the SECC in estate as well as saloon style. Other manufacturers such as
Toyota, Nissan, Volkswagen and Lada build estates of, to put it mildly,
varying degrees of sophistication.
Although it offers four-wheel drive all through its range, Subaru does
not market a full-scale 4x4. However, the 4WD Legacy estate is very well
equipped in both carrying capacity and traction. Volvo has built up a
strong estate business in the UK, partly because of the undeniable
ruggedess of its cars. It continues to expand the range with the
appearance of the new 855 estate.
The Citroen Xantia and XM benefit from the standard fitting of
self-levelling hydropneumatic suspension, which among other things keeps
well laden cars on an even keel.
A recent arrival on the estate car scene is the Renault Laguna, which
is a heavily modified version of the saloon. Options include
self-levelling suspension and a Family Pack with rear-facing children's
seats.
The back of the Laguna estate body is strengthened to take a rear-end
impact, and there is an ingenious roof box arrangement which helps to
solve the problem of where the luggage goes when the children's seats
are occupied.

MOST of the major European manufacturers have spent 1995 jostling each
other in the 4x4, MPV and medium saloon car sectors of the market, which
means fewer than usual small cars at the show can proudly wear an ''all
new'' tag.
But the most important one of them all, the Ford Fiesta, certainly
can.
Key features of the radically reworked newcomer, which is to be sold
alongside the existing range, include a new family of multi-valve light
alloy engines (with some design input from Yamaha), new front and rear
suspension and a fresh new body style.
Safety and security have also been given a high priority and cost of
ownership has been lowered thanks to extended service intervals and
items such as valve clearances, which only have to be checked every
100,000 miles.
Sampled last month in France, the 1.25-litre Fiesta was quicker,
smoother and nimbler than its predecessor and has all the hallmarks of a
winner.
The current Fiesta will undergo a name change at that time, becoming
the Fiesta Classic, and the good news if you have just taken delivery of
one is that it will remain in production ''for some time'', much as the
Peugeot 205 did on the introduction of the 106.
Each of the four series has been developed as an individual package.
The family models are tagged Encore and Fiesta LX, with the traditional
Ghia luxury model also on offer. The fastest Fiesta will be the Si.
All will use versions of the advanced Zetec-SE16-valve engine. It will
initially have an output of 75PS from a displacement of 1.25 litres, but
a 90PS 1.4 will be slotted in next year.
Also available from the outset will be a reduced-emission 1.3 version
of the existing 1.3-litre HCS unit, renamed the Endura E. Completing the
line-up is a naturally aspirated version of the 60PS 1.8-litre OHC
diesel, which becomes the Endura-D.
But the body shape will grab all the early attention. Rounded, with
soft angles between its panels, it has a traditional oval grille but a
deeper nose. The tail looks nothing like the existing model, instead
bearing a strong resemblance to the KA concept vehicle seen at the last
Scottish Motor Show.
Interiors are all brand new, with the emphasis on quality, comfort and
spaciousness to counter similar features to be found in the rival
Vauxhall Corsa.
Ford say customers will be able to specify an attractive array of
special features on the new generation Fiesta that are normally
associated with more expensive cars. These include CFC-free air
conditioning which will even send chilled air into the glovebox to keep
your bar of chocolate cool in the hottest weather.
Naturally Vauxhall has been keeping a weather eye on developments at
Ford and has responded by adding value to its established Corsa range,
while the 1996 Peugeot 106 has also been updated.
And if you want to see just how far ''hot'' tiddlers have progressed
over the past 35 years, take a look at the Mini Cooper on the Rover
stand and then run the rule over Fiat's Cinquecento Sporting. Are we
talking progress, or what?

IN a more relaxed era of Grand Prix racing, while reflecting on the
Innes Ireland, Jim Clark, Jackie Stewart succession, Graham Hill once
said about the Scots that ''there aren't many of them, but they are a
damned nuisance''.
One curious thing about international motorsport today is that, while
there are still not many of them, they remain, from the Graham Hill
point of view, as much of a damned nuisance as ever.
David Coulthard, a year ago regarded by some people as a rather
fortunate Grand Prix apprentice, now frequently leads the chase after
Michael Schumacher, and is a race winner for Williams-Renault in his own
right.
These days, the hardest psychological pressures on a Formula One
driver often seem to come from members, management not excluded, of his
own team. Coulthard counters with a level-headed approach and a strong,
confident appreciation of ''who he is''.
Over in world championship rallying, the Scottish crew of Colin McRae
and Derek Ringer are in the very top international bracket. McRae won
last year's RAC Rally and is preparing for this year's event jointly
leading the championship -- with his Subaru team-mate Carlos Sainz -- as
the deciding round in the British forests approaches.
McRae has an exuberant driving style which spectators all over the
world love to see. And, in common with the other top rally men like
Sainz, Juha Kankkunen and Didier Auriol, he has that humorous,
non-hung-up approach to interviews which should be compulsory viewing
for Grand Prix drivers.
In a unique family double, Alister McRae won the Mobil 1/Top Gear
Rally Championship for Nissan. His success came on UK, Irish and Isle of
Man roads, but the series was contested by drivers from many countries
in Europe, and he can count it as a victory in the face of international
competition.
The same applies to John Cleland, Scotland's finest saloon-car racer,
who won the British Touring Car Championship, driving for Vauxhall. The
BTCC attracts huge television audiences. Few competitors who figure in
it have either the will to win, the mastery of driving technique, the
racecraft or the pungent responses to interviewers' questions which John
Cleland displays.
Anthony Reid has been doing so well in touring car races in Japan that
some curious oriental manoeuvres have been made to try to put him out of
the game. And Dario Franchitti is one of the front runners in the German
championship, which may not be as close as the BTCC but features much
more powerful cars.
His signing for a second year with Mercedes shows that there are
career paths in motor racing away from the familiar single-seater route.
They may lead back to it, of course. It was Mercedes, in sports car
racing, which opened the door for Michael Schumacher.

Ross Finlay has a yearning for the high performers and exotics
PERHAPS the greatest appeal of any well-stocked motor show is that
visitors whose budgets stretch to the most modest of hatchbacks can go
along and gaze longingly at the sporting, exotic and high performance
cars they would love to own -- if only.
Even before going into the exhibition halls at the SECC, the
Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost and the Ferrari F40 on special display in the
concourse make up a pair of cars which, if they were sold as one lot at
an auction, would demand the financial resources of someone like the
Sultan of Brunei.
Until a few years ago it was easy to define a sports car. It would
have two seats, a hood, hairy performance, more than likely a bias
towards power over handling -- and certainly over ride.
Modern volume production sports cars and coupes come in many shapes,
sizes, performance levels and price tags. Some are difficult to
categorise. Cars like the Vauxhall Tigra and Calibra, the Rover Coupe
and the single-design Ford Probe and Mazda MX-6 are not really sporting
in character.
Neither is the Honda Prelude, intriguing though its rear-wheel
steering system may be.
Exactly what is the Subaru Impreza Turbo 2000 4WD -- highly tuned
saloon, sports car with a saloon appearance? But nobody could possibly
mistake the growling V10 Chrysler Viper for anything other than a sports
car in the raw.
Mazda makes an unarguable sports car in the little MX-5. It has clean
two-seater lines, rear-wheel drive to give it the handling style of a
sports car from a couple of decades ago, an exhaust note picked from
something like 500 which were tried on prototypes, and a gear change as
positive as a rifle bolt slipping home.
Britain chimes in with the MGF which, in VVC form, is technically one
of the most sophisticated cars in its class. Totally different in almost
every design department, the Jaguar XJ-R is a supercharged saloon aimed
right at the heart of the performance market, while all the other cars
in the XJ saloon range are executive or luxury affairs first and
foremost.
Think continental sporting cars and you may automatically think
Italian, although it is only quite recently that Italy's volume
manufacturers have come seriously back on to the sports car scene. The
Fiat Coupe is an eye-catching design with one model for handling
finesse, another using a turbocharged engine for straight-line speed.
Fiat has also begun to import the Barchetta. Here is another vehicle
with classic sports car lines, but it will come here in quite small
numbers, only with left-hand drive.
Alfa Romeo is right back in contention with two cars of stunning
appearance. The Spider is an exuberant two-seater open model, while the
closed coupe version revives the old model designation of GTV.
Although it has never built an out-and-out sports car, Volvo is
becoming more enthusiastic about providing blistering performance from
its top level saloons. The 850R is the most powerful Volvo ever put into
volume production, while the SECC display includes an 850 decked out as
for the British Touring Car Championship, in which the Swedish saloons
are among the front runners.
BTCC winner John Cleland took this year's title driving a Vauxhall
Cavalier. For the first few days of the show, his 1996 race-prepared
Vectra will be on display.
Fed up with being considered a manufacturer of mass-market fodder,
Toyota came up with the Supra to top a range which also contains the MR2
abd Celica. It is a twin-turbocharged coupe whose automatic traction
control system is a sensible feature of the specification, since it has
326bhp to pour on the tarmac, wet or dry.
Mitsubishi brings in tiny numbers of its recently revised 3000GT. The
flagship of the range features another twin-turbo engine, active
aerodynamics, and computer control of both brakes and suspension.
Honda's CRX is a genuine little sports car, but there is a lot more to
the company's sporting range than that. Hand built in a factory within a
factory, the NSX is one more Japanese supercar with high performance,
unexpectedly refined manners and, this year, a choice of closed or
Targa-topped bodywork.

Cars are still too easy to steal, Ross Finlay looks at some devices
that may deter the thief
IT'S the experience every motorist dreads. Returning to where you
parked your car only to find that it has gone.
The awful feeling in the pit of your stomach doesn't get any better
simply because you are insured. Losing your car is almost as bad as
having your home burgled -- and it can mean an even bigger financial
loss.
In recent years the claims issued by manufacturers with regard to
vehicle security have been loud enough and frequent enough to give the
impression that today's cars are well nigh impossible to steal other
than by bodily hoisting them on to a low loader.
Not so, say some people. A shock report in a recent issue of What Car?
magazine, based on the biggest independent car security survey ever
carried out in the UK, claimed life is still far too easy for the thief.
Out of 60 cars tested, priced between #7000 and #70,000, an
astonishing 50 could be broken into within two minutes.
Thirty models, some fitted with immobilisers, could be driven away in
under three minutes. Only six vehicles passed both entry and drive-away
tests, conducted in line with stringent new Home Office draft guidelines
which set time limits for how long cars must hold out under ''attack
testing'' conditions.
The magazine said the results were so disappointing, car buyers may be
better off choosing a model with no pretensions to security rather than
one stuffed with ineffective anti-theft equipment.
As always the truth of the matter lies somewhere in between.
Manufacturers have been investing a great deal of money in an effort to
deter all but the professional thief, who accounts for a fairly small,
if still significant, portion of the total losses paid out each year by
the insurers.
Where they have succeeded is in defeating thousands of attempts by
so-called joy riders to take away cars without their owner's consent,
which is why insurance companies offer preferential rates to drivers who
have gone to the trouble and expense of having immobilisers and other
devices fitted -- and offering lower groupings to those cars similarly
armed as standard.
So in this respect it is never a waste of money to opt for deadlocks,
immobilisers and other devices that are offered on a new model. And even
the crude but highly visible steering wheel or clutch/gear lever lock
which costs just a few pounds has been proven to be well worth fitting.
Just how many stolen cars have been whisked away simply because the
owner left a door open or even a key in the ignition? We don't know,
simply because few are willing to own up to such negligence for fear
that their insurer will either refuse to pay out or do so and then slap
on a hefty premium increase to next year's policy.
Take a look at the specification of the cars on view at the SECC and
take the level of security provided into account when comparing models
for value.
That ''bargain'' model pitched a thousand pounds or so cheaper than
its counterpart from another manufacturer might not be such a good buy
if it disappears in the night simply because it was just too easy to get
into.
There is no such thing as a thiefproof car and there never will be,
but sophisticated systems such as Tracker will make even seasoned
villains think twice. And this is generally all it takes for them to
shift their attention to easier targets.
The same goes for humbler fitments. What you are paying for is an item
that will buy you those precious few minutes during which a thief will
become frustrated or nervous. And this is often enough to save you from
that sinking feeling when you return to the car park.

The Scottish Motor Show promises to be one of the best yet with many
models so fresh that they are not yet in the showrooms, Ross Finlay
reports
AT 1pm on Friday in the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre,
with Ally McCoist of Rangers and Pierre Van Hooijdonk of Celtic, playing
on the same side for a change, officially declare the Diamond Jubilee
event open, the best Scottish Motor Show in recent years will be under
way.
In fact, visitors are to be admitted from midday on Friday, and one of
the main features of the show will already be obvious. While it has
often been the case that most of the cars on display could also be seen
in the showrooms and out on the road, the 60th Scottish Motor Show
exhibits a remarkable number of new and revised models which will not be
on sale until later this year, or even into 1996.
This really is a new car show, because it is the first opportunity in
Scotland to see many of the cars which will be the mainstay of
production during the latter half of the decade. That includes not just
saloons and hatchbacks, but also coupes and 4x4s.
In the SECC concourse there will be two special exhibits which are
definitely not for sale. One is the most famous Edwardian car ever
built, and would almost certainly, if it were sent for auction, turn out
to be the most valuable car in the world. The other is a sensational
limited-production GT car of the 1980s.
Peter Vardy's Ferrari F40 looks stunning. It is powered by a classic
479bhp V8 engine and is clothed in dramatic Pininfarina bodywork. When
new, the F40 was sold in the UK at a price approaching #200,000, but in
the heady days of the eighties some well-heeled collectors were said to
be waving seven-figure cheques around in an effort to be among the first
on the owners' list.
The other special exhibit is no less a car than AX 201, the original
1907 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. Not ''a Silver Ghost'', but the very car,
a 40/50hp model with supremely elegant Roi de Belges coachwork, which
was built for Rolls-Royce managing director Claude Johnson.
Johnson had it finished with silver-plated headlamps, windscreen
frame, hubs, door handles and so on, and he fitted a special plate on
the scuttle, engraved with the words ''The Silver Ghost''.
While it is one of the most superb-looking cars ever built, AX 201 did
not lead a pampered life. One of the best of the pioneer drivers,
Johnson entered it for the 2000-mile, five-day Scottish Reliability
Trial of 1907, which included the tough competition climbs at the Rest
and be Thankful and Trinafour, and immediately afterwards submitted the
car for an RAC test.
Under strict observation, it was driven, on the road every day, from
Glasgow to London and back, until it had covered 15,000 miles -- a
substantial mileage for the first decade of the century.
Stripped down and examined, it was found to be ''in all respects in
perfect running order and in exceptionally good condition''. During the
15,000 miles it had made only one involuntary stop, when a particularly
rough stretch of road vibrated the petrol tap to ''off''.
It was exploits like these, in addition to the quality of the design
and engineering, which gained Rolls-Royce its early reputation as making
the finest cars in the world.
Modern Rolls-Royces, and the Bentleys which are built alongside them
at Crewe, naturally figure in the main part of the show. So do Jaguar,
BMW, Range Rover, Lexus and other makes in the top bracket.
There is a strong technical interest in many of the cars here. For
example, the Citroen Xantia Activa, still to go on sale, has advanced
computer-controlled suspension. The Saab Sensonic uses a clutchless but
manual-change transmission of a kind which will surely become more
general.
The mid-engined MGF has three features of particular note. Its Rover
K-series engine has been enlarged to a 1.8-litre capacity originally
thought impossible to achieve, the VVC model has patented variable valve
control, and the power steering optional on the base model but standard
on the VVC is a unique electrical system.
Although it is not fundamental to the actual running of the car, the
new Vauxhall Vectra uses the world's most sophisticated
production-vehicle clock.
It links in with the radio signals of the pan-European RDS Time
system, not only checking the time shown on the car clock by
speed-of-light messages from the world's most accurate atomic clock at
Brunswick University in Germany, but also changing the display to take
account of the Vectra's movements through different time zones.
Vectra owners did not need to change their clock displays manually
when British Summer Time ended. The car did it for them. That is an
early example of the kind of seemingly futuristic technology which will
be available to car manufacturers -- and owners -- as we approach the
end of the century.
Still to appear in the showrooms, but on display at the SECC, are new
models from Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Ford, Chrysler, Citroen, Renault, Rover,
Hyundai, Honda, Peugeot, Mitsubishi, Vauxhall and Volvo.
Sports and GT cars are well represented. They include the MGF, the
Alfa Romeo GTV and Spider, as well as cars like the splendid Honda NSX,
Toyota Supra, Mazda MX-5 and Mitsubishi 3000GT from Japan. The
formidable V10-engined Chrysler Viper takes its Scottish exhibition bow.
The wide range of 4x4s includes vehicles from Ford, Vauxhall, Chrysler
Jeep, Toyota, Land Rover, Daihatsu, Lada, Mitsubishi, SsangYong, Isuzu,
Nissan and Suzuki. Rivals for the interest of customers looking for
something different from a conventional saloon, estate, coupe or
hatchback are the MPVs -- multi-purpose vehicles -- from Honda, Citroen,
Peugeot, Fiat, Chrysler, Renault, Mitsubishi and Volkswagen.
In addition to all the makes mentioned earlier, other stands are
devoted to Proton with its latest range from Malaysia, Daewoo of Korea,
pioneer of an individual style of retail network, and Subaru from Japan,
manufacturer of Colin McRae's cars in the World Rally Championship.
Ford's exhibits cover the greatest floor space, since they occupy
three complete halls at the SECC. But not all are static. In hall one
Ford is offering visitors the chance to try their skills at the wheel in
skid car manoeuvres. Professional drivers will also provide
demonstrations of how it really ought to be done.
Hall one will change its use on the last day of the show. The DVLA
take it over then for an auction of ''cherished'' number plates.
The 60th Scottish Motor Show is open from Friday until a week on
Sunday, normally between 10am and 10pm, except on the final day, Sunday,
November 19, when the doors will close at 8pm.
Admission prices are #6 for an adult, #4 for a child's ticket, OAP or
concession, and there is an all-in family ticket which costs #15 for two
adults and up to three children. Discounts for larger groups are also
available.

BILL SINCLAIR looks at the region's wealth of indigenous attractions.
SUDDENLY, all the world is aware of the stunning beauty and romantic
history of the heartland of Scotland, thanks to the Hollywoood movies
Rob Roy and Braveheart. Today the dramatic scenery is still there for
all to enjoy, but the modern Central Region has much more to offer.
The region incorporates the two main towns of Falkirk and Stirling,
the Hillfoots villages, the spectacular Trossachs and the River Forth.
It is blessed with excellent road and rail communications, giving its
population ready access to Glasgow Edinburgh and Tayside.
For most people in central Scotland, Falkirk's great attraction is its
shopping. It is home to the the impressive Howgate Centre just off the
High Street, which has 40 shops, an indoor market and 700 parking
places. At the East End of the High Street now the longest continuous
pedestrianised shopping area in Scotland is the new Callendar Square
Centre, a three-level atrium of quality shops. There is an outdoor
market on Wednesdays and Saturdays.
Falkirk has excellent road and rail communications to Edinburgh (M9),
Glasgow (M876) and Stirling (M80). There are two train stations, the
High serving the main Glasgow-Edinburgh line and Grahamston for trains
going north.
Before the railway arrived in Falkirk the Forth and Clyde Canal and
the Union Canal ferried passengers and cargo. Today these canals have a
new role as a valuable recreation resource, offering boat trips,
restaurants and inns, pleasant walks on their banks and some of the best
coarse fishing in the country.
Falkirk has excellent sports and leisure facilities. At the Mariner
Leisure Centre, Camelon, the accent is on fun with the exotic pool with
islands, chute and wave machine. There is also a sports hall, multi-gym
and squash courts, with a lounge and cafe to relax in. Kids parties are
a speciality.
Callendar Park, with its splendid museum within Callendar House,
offers traditional family entertainment in the form of boating, electric
cars and pitch-and-putt contained in its 170 acres.
There is an 18-hole golf course at Polment Hill as well as a variety
of nine and 18-hole private golf clubs throughout the district.
Each of the Hillfoots villages -- Dollar, Tillicoultry, Alva and
Menstrie -- has its own loyal following, though in housing terms Dollar
is seen as more exclusive than the others.
Thirteen miles east of Stirling on the A91, and within a 16-mile
radius of Alloa, Falkirk and Dunfermline, Dollar is best known for its
Academy, one of Scotland's leading schools. Today, the families of the
Academy's staff and pupils account for about one third of the town's
population. Dollar also has a good primary school, Strathdevon.
Dollar has an 18-hole golf course, tennis and bowling clubs, and
excellent local pubs, some serving the real ales of the local
Harviestoun Brewery.
Mill Green Park, the cherry-tree lined Dollar Burn and the fairytale
Dollar Glen offer appealing walks.
Stirling is a thriving historic royal burgh reminiscent of Edinburgh,
with its crag-top castle and old town, and its new Lower town. Like
Edinburgh it is a university and tourist town, and its central location
and mainline rail links allow easy access to all parts of Scotland.
The town is expanding to take in adjacent communities like Bannockburn
and Cambusbarron, growing rapidly as an enjoyable place to live and
work, in textiles, agriculture, electronics and service industries.
However, the provincial character of Stirling remains. As Tom Lannon
wrote in The Making of Modern Stirling: ''too small to be big, too big
to be small''.
There are excellent shopping facilities at the Thistle Centre, and
Thistle Centre II is under construction.
Educational needs are met by a wealth of nurseries, primary schools
and secondary schools and, of course, Stirling University. Leisure
facilities range from tennis to swimming to golf.
Local golf courses include the noted King's Park Course. On the
doorstep there is marvellous countryside for walkers -- west to the
Trossachs and north to the Highlands. There are easy climbs in the
Campsie Fells at the south-west of the Carron Valley.
The MacRobert Arts Centre on the university campus hosts art house
movies and theatrical productions.
Just some of the attractions within an hour's drive of Stirling are
the Wallace Monument and the Bannockburn Heritage Centre, Inchmahome,
Loup of Fintry and the Falls of Dochart. There's the the Blair Drummond
Safari Park, and Culcreuch, Finlarig, Campbell and Airth castles, as
well as Rough Castle on the Antonine Wall, and Watling Lodge.
North and north-west of Stirling are Bridge of Allan, Dunblane and
Doune -- all popular places to live.

<HEADLINE>The rugby team with a taste for religion rather than beer. Samoans offer more than just a prayer</HEADLINE>

THE true tale which epitomises best the visitors to our shores from
Western Samoa concerns a full case of beer, presented by their hotel
management when they arrived in Edinburgh last Thursday. It is still in
the team room. It is still full.
''That would not have happened in my day,'' admitted their manager, a
United Reform minister and theologian, the Rev Dr Faitala Talapusi.
''The present bunch of guys are not great drinkers.'' But as Scottish
sides are about to find out, they are very fine rugby players.
''After the World Cup in South Africa we were rated No.6,'' their
leader informed me. Is that ahead of us, I queried? ''And Australia.''
Dr Talapusi, a striking man with a head of hair we baldies can barely
remember, is a former captain of his country. He won 15 caps as a No.8
between 1970-79.
His only game in the UK was in Sheffield, where he happened to be
attending an ecumenical conference. These days the minister is more
teacher than preacher, but Christianity is an important component of his
side.
''We went to St Giles last Sunday and we have a prayer meeting every
night. Religion is important to us. Ours is a society dominated by the
family, yet I hope we do not force it on others.
''At home we would never play or train on a Sunday, but we agreed to
the Scotland A game at Hawick this Sunday because we did not want to
cause any difficulties for our hosts.''
Nor did they complain, as many would have, in being sent on a 51-hour
round the world trip to be here at all -- ''I guess it was the cheapest
way.''
In Western Samoa, rugby is the most popular of the 'imported' sports,
though many of the current touring party have also played rugby league
and football. As amateurs . . . honest!
But the most popular sport of all is Samoan cricket. ''It has slightly
different rules to the ones used at Lord's, but we think it is more
fun.''
There are no overs, bowlers come in from whichever end is convenient,
sides can be 30-strong and you are out if you do not attempt to hit the
ball. Geoff Boycott would never have been a star.
Back on the rugby field, Dr Talapusi spoke frankly about the advent of
professionalism. ''A country like ours is at a massive disadvantage. We
simply do not have the money to pay.
''Our players are poached by rugby league, by Australia, by Japan, by
New Zealand, and there is nothing we can do about it. We wish these
players well. It is hard, though, to build a successful international
side.''
The Western Samoans are disappointed -- no, hurt -- by their exclusion
from the new Super 12 competition which would have brought them extra
revenue. They are, however, fighting back.
''We have put forward proposals for a pan-Pacific series, which would
involve the likes of Fiji, Tonga, Japan, Argentina, the USA, Canada, and
Hong Kong. If this gets under way next season we might be able to pay
our players something.''
Since the World Cup the Samoans have lost two men to rugby league, one
to New Zealand and three could not make the tour because of work and
family commitments.
The average wage in Western Samoa is #50 a week, a sobering thought
for some of our would-be superstars. There are about 2000 rugby players
and the game is popular in schools.
''I still believe we have a good squad,'' the manager insisted
loyally. ''We have not lost a game at home since 1991 and play before
crowds of 18,000.''
But Dr Talapusi knows that away victories over Scotland, or England,
on this tour would give the sport, and the financial coffers, a massive
boost. ''Against the background of professional rugby this is one of the
most important trips we have ever made.
''Coming to terms with the conditions is our major problem. We played
our last match before we left home in 80F.'' He accepted my assurance
that this was a sweltering November. ''The drier the ground the better
we like it. We want to move the ball.''
Coach Bryan Williams is an old aquaintance, the former All Black wing
was in Scotland with the 1991 party. ''It's great to be back,'' he
chipped in.
The SRU's man with the party, Ken Crichton, opined that this was the
happiest bunch of tourists with which he had ever been involved. He
declined the suggestion that he might like to go teetotal in support.
I believe myself that the Scottish public will love their style.
Whether our players will be quite so appreciative we are about to find
out.
An advertisement in yesterday's Herald referred to Scotland playing
Western Samoa at Hawick on Sunday, which will come as a big surprise to
Rob Wainwright and his men. The game at Hawick is, of course that
between  Western Samoa and Scotland A.

LINK Homes, the commercial arm of the Link Housing Association, is
currently letting a number of two-bedroom flats at the recently
completed Whinwell Road in Stirling, refurbished tenement flats at Bank
Street in Falkirk city centre, and two bedroom semi-detached homes with
gardens built by local builder Murdoch Smith, also in Falkirk.
All the properties are partly furnished with white goods, carpets and
curtains and are at the upper end of the rented market, with rents from
#360 to #390/month.
Murray MacMillan, regional housing manager says: ''We are aimimg for
the mobile professional or young families who don't want the bother of
buying or selling for a year or two.
''Vacancies come up every six months, which is the six-month
short-assured tenacy term, though tenants can have the tenancy as long
as they wish. It is first come first served, so it is really advisable
to get your name down as soon as you can.''

ALAN Thomson aims to make the most of his surprise recall to the
Scottish team for his fifth world championships in Egypt next week.
It was the unavailability of Peter Nicol and Martin Heath that opened
the door for the 35 year-old Thomson to add to his 64 caps. ''I'm
fortunate to get back in but delighted,'' he said. ''I realise that this
is likely to be my swan-song, and I'm just hoping that this weakened
team can do ourselves credit.''
With Canada, Ireland, and Austria in the same section, Thomson is
confident that the side completed by Austrian-based Alasdair Taylor,
Belgian-based Dave Gordon, and Newlands' Barry Sutherland can retain a
place among the top 16.
''But the shame of the situation is that if Peter and Martin had been
in the side, there would have been a great chance of a medal,'' Thomson
claimed.
Victory in the 1992 European championships was the highlight of
Thomson's career but, although Egypt may be his last appearance for the
full side, he is already carving out a second international career as an
over-35.
He is the Scottish champion, and recently achieved a double by winning
the main title and the over-35 event in the Middlesex championships.
At the men's World Open in Cyprus today, Peter Nicol meets Finland's
Sami Elopuro, with the victor going through to the quarter-finals.

GLASGOW tenements come in all sorts, shapes and sizes, but very few
come like the second-floor flat at 128 Raeberry Street. It used to be a
standard four-apartment tenement in one of the less prestigious parts of
town. Now it is an open plan, postmodern interior with neo-classical
touches and a strong maritime influence.
This exceptional home was designed for himself and his wife in the
early 1980s by the late architect John M Cowell. And its part of the
city is now on the way up. Raeberry Street, just off Belmont Street in
Kelvinbridge, has seen a rise in owner occupation in recent years.
Every interior wall in the tenement was demolished by Cowell and his
colleague, the architect and builder Ian Milliken. Floating floors were
installed above cork sound-proofing. New walls and a split-level
interior were created, complete with neo-classical pediments.
As an architect with the well-known Glasgow firm of Gillespie Kidd &amp;
Coia, John Cowell knew what he was doing -- although his wife Ann was
not convinced at the time.
''We were living in Hyndland, but it was too much like sleepy
hollow,'' she recalls. ''We had friends who moved to Raeberry Street and
we liked the atmosphere there. When a tenement came on the market John
wanted to buy it, but I thought it looked terrible and said there was no
way I was moving there. He insisted that it could look great -- if he
could design it in his own way.''
And he did. Gutting and re-building the interior took three years,
including a seven-month stint when the Cowells had to live elsewhere
while the worst of the work was being carried out.
''It was well worth it,'' says Mrs Cowell now. ''John created a
marvellous home for us. Since we were alone we did not need lots of
bedrooms, so he was able to make the best of the space.''
Some people dislike open-plan living because there is so much space to
keep tidy. But Cowell's designs included a central core which contains
much of the apartment's storage space -- wardrobes, filing cabinets,
wine cellar, and containers for daily clutter.
Sadly, John Cowell died a couple of years ago and Ann now feels it is
time to move on. ''We were very happy here, and I want someone else to
be just as happy.''
In an unusual touch, a corner high up in the living room is filled
with a trompe l'oeil painting, by artist Callum McKenzie, of a shelf of
books. ''It seems to fit so well into that corner that I'll be leaving
it behind, along with all of the fitted bookcases,'' says Mrs Cowell.
But she will be taking a fleet of model boats with her when she sails
off to her new home. Over the years she and her husband amassed a
collection of some 110 model boats of all shapes and sizes.
Her tenement is sometimes described as being in ''Mackintosh'' style,
but she rejects that. ''It's not Mackintosh -- it's Cowell. My husband
designed the house entirely his own way.''
The accommodation comprises a large lounge, a raised kitchen and
dining-room area, a bedroom, and a study which doubles as a spare
bedroom. The split-level home has hardwood floors.
Solicitors Breeze, Paterson &amp; Chapman are seeking offers over #65,000.
''I can make this place
special, the architect
insisted. And he did . . .''

WITH the decline of many traditional industries, the last 20 years
have seen a great deal of population movement with Central Region as new
jobs often involved relocation for employees.
Many families have taken the opportunity to change from older housing
with its traditional problems of draughts, damp and traffic noise, to
new homes with all the advantages and convenience now built-in by
today's developers.
Forward-looking builders are persuading people to buy with incentives
such as discounted mortgages, assisted move schemes, part-exchange deals
and, in some cases, companies have been cutting their profit margins to
keep the market moving.
As well as local movement, there have been a lot of incomers to the
region, many demanding new homes, reports Malcolm Cordwell-Smith, area
manager at estate agents Allen &amp; Harris.
He says: ''Twenty years ago there was not a lot of new house building
in Central Region, though Dunblane went through a terrific expansion as
a popular dormitory town at the end of a motorway.
''There ware also developments in Bridge of Allan and Stirling of
semis and detached homes with two and three bedrooms.
''Fifteen years ago, more executive-type properties were built, for
example four-bedroom houses at Hopetoun Drive in Bridge of Allan, and
these now sell for #150,000.
''There was a gap in development for a number of years until five
years ago when there was a further surge with the like of CALA at
Dunblane.
''In the last 18 months there has been an explosion of new properties
within the region, from flats by Tulloch at Stirling to the exclusive
Laurelhill homes by CALA on the edge of the attractive King's Park area
of Stirling, and at Copperbeech at Killearn. Wimpey have built in
Dollar, and Richmond Homes who have a history of building at Merlin Park
in Dollar, are currently building at the Ness.''
As befits a company with its headquarters in Falkirk, CALA have been
involved in a number of developments in Central Region, mainly building
detached homes at the upper end of the market. Each new site is,
however, dealt with individually.
Their latest development, at Annfield in Stirling city centre, follows
on the success of their development of four and five-bedroom luxury
detached homes at Laurelhill, only half-a-mile mile away.
Gillian Gray, sales and marketing manager for the Stirling area, says:
''At Annfield, we are looking to those moving out of larger homes who
want good-sized luxury apartments, and also to those younger people
moving up the property ladder to smaller and cheaper detached homes than
we previously built in Stirling.
''We have a mix of eight one, two and three-bedroom flats left at
Annfield Gardens, ranging in price from #49,000 to #85,000. There are
also two detached homes currently available at Annfield Grove, the show
house -- a Sherbourne and a Newick house style.
The Sherbourne has generous upstairs storage plus a coombed ceiling in
the master bedroom. The Newick is a more compact family home, with
elegant double doors linking the drawing room and the dining room. Both
homes have four bedrooms upstairs.
At Tullibody, an attractive village just outside Stirling on the A907
Stirling to Alloa Road, MacKenzie Developments (Linlithgow) has chosen
the picturesque setting in the woods overlooking the Braehead Golf
Course for their Golf Course Homes development of three, four and
five-bedroom detached houses on large plots. Prices start at #83,750.
The current interior designed show-house has been released for sale at
the give-away price of #110,750 to include the carpets and curtains. The
recent takeover by Wilcon Homes of L&amp;C may provide an autumn windfall
for new house buyers at Station Wynd, Doune. Gordon Miller, Scottish
director of this leading housebuilder, has plans to standardise house
styles in their developments across the country, and so massive
reductions are being offered on the Told L&amp;C styles. A select number of
plots is having #5000 taken off the price if you can conclude missives
within 14 days.
There are two types of detached villas left at Station Wynd: the
four-bedroom Laggan starting at #89,950, and the four-bedroom Morar at
#111,950.
At Lochgreen, Falkirk, Bett Homes are selling four-bedroom detached
homes, including the Fife, with detached garage, for #127,950, and the
Roxburgh, with attached garage, for #137,250. There are 15 plots in
total, with five different house styles.
At The Pines in Stirling, Bett offers luxury flats and four and
five-bedroom detached houses, some with integral garages. Prices run
from #100,950 to #211,950 for the five-bedroom Rothesay. The Rothesay
has en-suite facilities in the master and guest bedrooms.

IF you like to breathe and move with absolute freedom, in one fell
swoop you can your way into this large modern house in the village of
Blanefield, under the steep slopes of the Campsie Fells.
Standing prominently on Campsie Dene Road, The Fells was built around
1960 and extended ten years ago, even though it was quite big already.
So spacious is not quite the word for this family home offering 5000sq
ft of floor area laid out as: a central lounge, sitting room, dining
room, three bedrooms (two of which have en-suite bathrooms), a guest
suite with its own bedroom and bathroom, a study, a games room, a
gallery overlooking the lounge, and an integral double garage.
The lounge has three large windows which have views across the garden
to Stockiemuir. Outside, the house has a stable block, tack room, shed
and greenhouse.
The garden mainly consists of lawn, surrounded by mature trees and
woodland. Slater Hogg &amp; Howison is seeking offers over #295,000.

DOUG GILLON CONCLUDES HIS LOOK AT SPORT AND SPORTSMEN IN NORWAY.
COMMON sense, a philosopher observed, is so out of fashion that it is
now often mistaken for genius.
Perhaps. It is certainly amazing how life's truths are often so
obvious that they are ignored, especially in football.
You would think, as the game in Britain goes down the toilet that the
experience should give us cause for reflection.
So Scotland is about to qualify for the European Championships? A
formality? Great, let's hope so. But let us not delude ourselves that
our game is healthy.
If Scottish football was an export company, it would be bankrupt, yet
we are blind to the evidence of the balance sheet of decline. We used to
have players dotted around Europe, while simultaneously, Scots formed
the backbone of almost every English side challenging for any honour.
Now Europe is devoid of our exports, and Scots of influence in the
English Premiership are scarce.
Surely we can learn something from other small countries where the
game is successful?
Like Norway, perhaps, whose national team made it to the World Cup
finals in the USA last year, while Britain's four teams foundered?
Norway, whose women's national XI five months ago beat Germany 2-1, to
win the women's World Cup.
Norway, whose champions, Rosenburg from Trondheim, have already
humiliated Blackburn in the Champions' League, with a team dismissed as
being part-time.
Norway, which has six females playing professionally in Japan and
whose Viking males have invaded the leagues of Europe -- more than 100
players over the years, and whose current influential UK exports include
Stig Inge Bjornbye (Liverpool), Lars Bohinen and Henning Berg (both
Blackburn), Erik Thorstvedt (Spurs), Jan Age Fjortoft (Middlesbrough),
and Jastein Flo (Sheffield United).
All this from a nation with 800,000 fewer people than Scotland's
5.13m, winters that would freeze all our clubs' assets, and a mega
geography problem. Turn Norway upside down, and its most northerly
mainland outpost, instead of being 320 miles inside the Arctic Circle,
would be just a ski jump or two north of Rome. Include the island of
Spitzbergen, and it would be in the northern Sahara.
That puts whinging about travel problems as a result of Highland
League influence in the Scottish League into perspective.
Eddie Turnbull was a crusty though endearing manager. What he would
have made of the modern Norwegian footballer can best be assessed from a
comment directed in frustration at Alan Gordon, when he was with
Hibernian. Gordon, a graduate playing professionally at the highest
level would be a virtual dinosaur in Scottish football today.
''The trouble wi' you, Gordon, is that a' yer brains are in yer
heid,'' assessed Turnbull, suspicious of educated players.
Indoctrinated by respected managers like Turnbull, and with the
prejudice reinforced by generations of commentators who still dismiss
teams of part-timers of any nationality, many people fell into the trap,
believing it to be true.
Yet not so long ago there was a clue, visible for any who chose to
see. It came on a day when England's commentators were typically
dismissive of just such a team, in Oslo.
Scots, particularly, will recall the occasion. For us, there is always
a frisson of pleasure in watching the English getting humped. At
anything. But most especially football. And no matter by whom.
A gentleman called Bjorge Lillelein, commentating on Norway's 2-1 home
victory in a 1981 World Cup qualifier, enriched one of life's memorable
moments. Invoking Horatio Nelson, the Duke of Wellington, Winston
Churchill, and a horde of other English heroes, Lillelien, a doyen of
David Francie status, concluded majestically: ''Are you listening Maggie
Thatcher? Your boys took a hell of a beating.''
Helge Sovdsnes, Norwegian FA secretary, confirms that almost all of
his country's players spend much of their career part-time, because of
their studies. Around 80% of professionals in Norway have brains in
their heads as well as feet. They are either students or graduates.
When Norwegian pupils travel to matches, they are obliged to take text
books, and keep up with studies.
''We view education at university level as essential to developing the
sport,'' said Andreas Morisbakk, manager of the NFA's department of
development. ''Players must be intelligent, approach the game in a
questioning way.''
Graeme Souness, in the aftermath of an early Rangers exit from Europe
during his term at Ibrox, is the only Scot publicly to have acknowledged
this truth, observing that our footballers: ''lack the intelligence of
the continental player.''
Despite spending 24 hours a day in the dark during winter, vision is
not lacking in Norway.
At their National Sports Centre, goalkeepers from football, handball,
and ice hockey train together, convinced they can learn from one
another. Reflexes are important? Right? Who have the best reflexes?
Karate players. So the country's leading karateka train with the
footballers. Keepers fall, suffering injury. What sport is all about
falling? Judo. So Norway's leading judo players also train with the
keepers.
Goalkeeper injury is consequently a rarity. ''We all learn from one
another,'' says Arne Myhrvold, president of the Norwegian Olympic
Committee.
Ballet dancers and gymnasts are brought in to teach balance. Arsenal
once employed a ballet coach, but the programme was quickly abandoned.
Players were not sufficiently supple even to do the warm-up prescribed.
Though so-called part-time, the average Norwegian player spends more
time training than our pampered football divas, almost all of whom are
on the way home by lunchtime. Why are Norwegians snapped up around
Europe? Perish the thought that it is because they are perceived as
fitter, with better skills than Scots.
Egil ''Drillo'' (The Dribbler) Olsen, head coach of the national men's
team, is dismissive of the British approach. ''You are frightened of the
intellectual way to analyse football,'' he said. ''We have a more
professional culture, and the right way to live -- maybe that's because
we started the game 50 years after you.''
He thinks England's recent international managers are obsessed with
playing attractively. ''England would have won the World Cup in 1990 if
they had not changed their style,'' claims Olsen. ''The whole country
played in a direct way, yet they changed their style for the national
team. I still can't understand why.
''We try to develop a well-organised, zonal defence, with a direct,
penetrative style in attack. It's physical, based on strength and
endurance, but we have achieved good results. I am not concerned about
attractive football, only results.''
It is no coincidence, then, that the only UK team left with any chance
of progressing in Europe is Nottingham Forest. Under Frank Clark, left
back when they won the European Cup in 1979, Forest have stuck with the
same, penetrative system introduced then by Brian Clough.
Morten Larsen, head of talent development for the NFA, confirms a
budget of #1m for youth development.
A recent report at the University of Illinois identified Norwegians as
the happiest people in the world, because they have genuine equality of
the sexes, a good sex life, and healthy lifestyle. Equality is a feature
of women's football. At under-16 level half of the country's 1027 teams
are female.
The climate is conquered by completing the national league-and-cup
programme in the summer (it ended last weekend), and by playing in six,
full-size indoor halls, with another eight planned.
It would be over-simplifying matters to say Norwegian sportsmen and
women are better drilled thanks to oil revenue. They still have the
highest taxation in Europe, but their innovative, indomitable nature
suggests the midnight sun will not set on their competitors striking
gold.

PARTS of Edinburgh's Georgian New town are seeing prices collapse.
Deserted by their former office occupants, landlords are having to
accept less than half of what they might once have expected. A new breed
of buyer, the residential developer, is moving in to take advantage of
low prices.
As offices, townhouses were fetching up to #800,000 or more in the
late 1980s. None can command anything like that now and owners are
having to accept the market's new realities.
Several significant residential conversions have already taken place.
Now John Brown of estate agents DTZ Debenham Thorpe is selling a former
office property at a huge mark-down.
Number 49 Manor Place is a typical period townhouse with accommodation
on five floors. It was previously used as an office and could be sold as
such, if the demand were there. But John Brown believes the property is
ideal for residential conversion -- and is selling it a price that
reflects the demise of this office district.
''During the boom in the office market in the late 80s, 49 Manor Place
would have sold for around half a million. But the market has moved on
and today we are looking for offers over #190,000,'' he says.
Meanwhile Rothesay Terrace, which until recently consisted entirely of
offices, could soon be totally returned to residential use.
Hydro-Electric's former HQ took up most of the houses in Rothesay
Terrace's crescent, but these were sold recently for residential con
version. Now DTZ has been asked to market the last two buildings in the
crescent, 17 and 18, on behalf of the Common Services Agency. The large
properties have private gardens to the front and enjoy views over the
Dean Village to the rear.
Offers over #220,000 and #240,000 are sought. ''If they are sold for
residential conversion, the entire crescent side of the Terrace would be
returned to its original use,'' says John Brown.

The homes market is stuck in the mud and a real Budget booster is
needed to pull it out. Stewart McIntosh considers two new reports.
HOUSE prices in Scotland have stood still over the last three months,
according to two market reports on activity during the third quarter of
1995.
A healthy blast of realism is blowing through the property market as
estate agents and lenders acknowedge that 1995 turned out to be a
tougher year than the pundits had predicted.
In his firm's latest market report Colvil Johnston, managing director
of estate agents Slater Hogg &amp; Howison, is sharply critical of those who
tried to talk the market up. He also has a go at those who were too
gloomy . . .
''It is hard to remember a year during which there have been more
contrasting reports on the health of the property market in Scotland,''
he says. ''With everyone keen to voice an opinion -- ranging from 14%
increases to mass negative equity -- the distressed house-buyer and
seller has every reason to be more confused than ever.
''Some of these statistics are a clumsy attempt to talk up the market,
while others are simply incorrect.''
Slater Hogg completed just under #100 million sales during the third
quarter of this year throughout its 32 branches, a strong market share
which Johnston believes gives his firm ''the most reliable indicator as
to the health of the market in Central Scotland''.
He claims three reasons for the veracity of his statistics:
* They are based on actual sales, which is different from lending
institutions whose property surveys are calculated on the amount of
lending during a set period. ''Unfortunately, however well-intentioned,
this can be unreliable as lending criteria varies from lender to lender
and week to week,'' says Johnston.
* Slater Hogg sells property from tiny flats up to #500,000 mansions,
and everything in between. ''Our sales are representative of every level
of the market and are not concentrated in any particular price
bracket,'' he says.
* Other agencies do not have the same size of network or volume of
sales as Slater Hogg to provide them with an accurate overall picture.
Meanwhile, Johnston's latest report reveals that prices have shown no
increase whatsoever in the Central Belt of Scotland. ''There is more
evidence for prices falling than there is for prices rising,'' says the
report. ''As far as we can see, the only price rises in Scotland this
year have happened within the West End of Glasgow and that levelled off
during the third quarter.''
Slater Hogg's average selling price during the third quarter was
#59,351, an apparent increase of 1.7% compared with the same time last
year -- but in reality merely a reflection of the fact that the firm
sold property of a slightly higher-than-usual value.
With two exceptions, the choice of property available on the market
remains strong and varied. There is a shortage at the top end of the
market for detached properties worth more than #250,000 in superb
condition. These still have a market if they are truly a one-off within
their district.
The other exception is in three bedroom semi-detached villas. It
appears that the current occupiers of these properties are not making
the move up to the next level of house, creating a bottleneck in the
market.
The choice for first-time buyers has never been better, says the
report. As many potential first-time buyers are choosing to stay at home
longer, or to rent their property instead, there are more properties
available for a smaller number of first-timers.
Property is currently very affordable, thanks to a combination of the
fall in house prices over the last two years and steady interest rates.
Johnston's refreshing realism about the state of the market is backed
by the Nationwide Building Society's latest Housing Finance Review. The
Nationwide review supports Slater Hogg's in saying that prices in
Scotland stood still during the third quarter of this year -- and goes
on to say that prices have fallen north of the Border by 1.7% over the
last 12 months.
The building society predicts that total house sales in the UK this
year will be 10% down on 1994, only slightly better than the the 1.2
million sales in 1992 -- the worst year of the UK property market
recession.
The good news is that Nationwide sees grounds for believing the market
will see the beginnings of recovery next year, but much will depend on
the economy and on the Government's housing policy. Lower taxes in the
Budget, combined with the recent lower mortgage rates, could provide the
basis for an upturn in the housing market.
''However, confidence remains poor and restoring it is a precondition
for sustained market recovery,'' concludes the Nationwide's report. ''It
is in this respect that any action to support the housing market in the
forthcoming Budget could have most impact, sending a positive signal to
the market in reaffirming the Government's commitment to
owner-occupation.''

RICHARD Corsie declared himself ''quite happy'' with the draw for
February's Churchill Insurance world indoor championship which was made
in Preston yesterday.
The three times winner has been paired against former Irish and
British champion Jeremy Henry. ''We've met once before when he beat me
in last year's Irish Masters,'' said Corsie. ''He's a good player and it
won't be easy but then again none of them are in the world
championship.''
Should Corsie win he could well line up against fellow Scot Paul
Conlan in the second round, provided the Midlothian man can overcome
Australia's Adam Jeffrey.
Hugh Duff, winner of the recent Saga Open, faces Welsh opposition in
the shape of Martyn Roberts as does Tweedbank's Joyce Lindores, who
takes on Stephen Rees.
Graham Robertson, seeded No.8, has a tough match against Commonwealth
gold medalist Neil Burkett, from South Africa, while Prestwick's David
Gourlay Jr faces world outdoor champion and No.6 seed Tony Allcock.
Draw:
Singles -- A Thomson (England) v K Kerkow (Australia), D Corkill
(Ireland) v Hong Kong qualifier, W Richards (England) v M Gilliland
(Canada), G Robertson (Scotland) v N Burkett (S Africa), H Duff
(Scotland) v M Roberts (Wales), G Smith (England) v S Rankin (Scotland),
I Taylor (Australia) v L Nixon (Jersey), I Schuback (Australia) v I Bond
(England), N McMahon (Australia) v G Harlow (England), R Brassey (N
Zealand) v A Welsh (Guernsey), J Price (Wales) v M Johnston (Ireland), T
Allcock (England) v D Gourlay Jr (Scotland), M King (England) v New
Zealand qualifier, S Rees (Wales) v J Lindores (Scotland), P Conlan
(Scotland) v A Jeffrey (Austrlia), R Corsie (Scotland) v J Henry

CLARE Wood, who regained the singles title at the recent Guardian
Direct championships in Telford, heads for Edinburgh next week to
contest the Texaco Women's Challenger at the Craiglockhart which starts
on Tuesday.
The event is being held in Scotland for the first time, and the
27-year-old from Brighton is one of three British players accepted into
the 32 draw.
Wood, who lost her place on the WTA Tour after having slipped almost
100 places to 185 on the world ranking after being hampered by a
hamstring injury last year, will be looking to use the Texaco event to
help her climb back into the top flight.
''I've been struggling with injuries over the past 12 months,'' said
Wood, ''but hopefully that's all behind me now and I can concentrate on
getting back into the top 100 again.''
Exeter left-hander Karen Cross and Florida-based Rachel Viollet
complete the British line-up, although national runner-up Samantha
Smith, the 1994 Scottish champion, is expected to be awarded one of the
two wild cards on offer.
Czech teenager Sandra Kleinova, the world No.131, is favourite for the
event which has attracted players from 19 countries, while Scottish No.1
Michele Mair will be in action in this weekend's qualifying.
* BRITAIN'S Tim Henman reached the second round of the #16,000 ATP
Challenger event in Beijing yesterday.
The 21-year-old from Oxford, who landed his first national title by
beating Greg Rusedski at Telford, overcame China's Hai Bo Deng 6-3, 4-6,
6-3.
Henman, favourite to take the title, now takes on Indonesia's Benny
Wijaya, but countryman Mark Petchey, the No.8 seed, suffered a surprise
4-6, 6-4, 6-4 defeat by Michael Geserer, of Germany.

MELBOURNE CUP
MYSTERY surrounds Double Trigger's poor showing in the Melbourne Cup
following reports before the race suggested that Mark Johnston's runner
had supplied an ''irregular swab'' during a routine dope test.
Double Trigger, the 7-1 favourite, finished seventeenth of the 21
runners, and as the field went to post, it was reported that officials
had discovered the problem.
Johnston was asked for an explanation by course officials. When the
trainer told them he had ''given the horse nothing at all,'' Double
Trigger was allowed to take his chance.
''I can't explain what happened,'' said Johnston. ''The stewards took
a post-race sample from him and told me, at this stage, not to be too
concerned.''
Double Trigger was a beaten runner five furlongs out, dropping back
through the field from fourth to finish more than 50 lengths behind the
winner.
The race was won by locally trained Doriemus, with the Irish trained
Vintage Crop third.
Damien Oliver brought Doriemus, drawn very wide, to land the first
prize of #660,891 for winning trainer Lee Freedman.
''Great horse, great ride, great effort,'' said the trainer, who also
saddled the fourth home, Quick Ransom, trained by Johnston in last
year's running of the race.

MILLIONS of pounds of taxpayers' money have been wasted by the
Government awarding building contracts to the lowest bidder instead of
focusing on quality and reliability, the Prime Minister's efficiency
unit has found in a report published yesterday.
The by-pass linking Edinburgh to the M8 extension was included in a
list of 20 projects studied by the unit. Some had exceeded their initial
estimates by a total of #500m.
The report does not specify which overshot, but a Scottish Office
spokeswoman said yesterday: ''We can claim confidently that the M8
extension is one of the shining examples and is not alone in other
recent successful projects in Scotland. It will be completed within
budget, ahead of time and without a single contractual claim.''
The unit, headed by Sir Peter Levene, stated that some departments had
been too ''inward looking''. Obsession with the lowest bid could cost
more in the long term, it stated.
Sir Peter told a Cabinet Office news conference that the Government
spends #6bn a year on construction projects and by becoming a ''better
client'' and keeping a closer eye on projects millions can be saved.
The projects studied included the British Library, near King's Cross,
London, the M4 extension, the new Inland Revenue headquarters at
Nottingham and the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.
Sir Peter called for a ''new deal'' between the Government and the
construction industry. The Government should supervise and manage
contracts better. The industry ''should be less adversarial and more
customer focused in the way it operates.''
Public Services Minister Roger Freeman promised to ensure that the
Government would obtain ''best value for money'' in future contracts by
following the committee's advice and monitoring them more carefully.

IT WAS the afternoon after quite a night before for some Tory MPs.
Those who had not already prudently divested themselves of consultancies
probably had been taking steps that morning before the spotlight of
publicity shines.
When Mr Michael Heseltine explained that he was taking Prime
Minister's Questions because Mr Major was en route to New Zealand, an
Opposition wag shouted: ''He wants to get as far away as possible.''
Mr Major may have been keener not to face some of his own back
benchers than the rampantly cheerful Opposition. It was he, after all,
who set up the Nolan Committee from whom all these embarrassments to
many of his own side have flowed.
Mr Heseltine was careful to point that out, though he added that it
was this act which had enabled the House to take the decision on
publicising earnings from consultancies the previous night. Put another
way, it was the act which enabled the House to kick him in the teeth and
thin the wallets of some who, not long before, had reinstated him as
their leader.
The Prime Minister of New Zealand, who sounds like the kind of host
whose parties one visits only once, has said he might well ''take a
ruler'' to Mr Major for his support for French nuclear tests.
Notwithstanding, Wellington might well have been a jollier spot to touch
down on than Westminster yesterday.
Mindful of those members of the law-and-order party who are muttering
about breaking the rules because the rules do not suit them, Mr John
Prescott got Mr Heseltine into a corner in which he could only say that
he and the Prime Minister believed the spirit and the letter of the
rules should be obeyed.
The Opposition, daily behaving more like a hunting pack which has
almost brought its prey down, went after its next favourite version of
Tory sleaze -- the anonymous and sometimes foreign donations to the
party.
The DPM tried to turn the tables and several times bellowed ''Trade
unions''. But, in the current climate, this is like holding a crucifix
before an atheistical vampire and hoping he will go away. Mr Blair's new
Labour Party may be in hock hook, line, and sinker to the old barons as
Hezza charged, but, just as present, he does not look in hock to
anybody.
Mr Heseltine protested that the vast majority of Members were
motivated by the highest standards of public service and was greeted by
derisive guffaws from those simple Labour MPs who believe their own
propaganda.
He was given some respite when Liberal Democrat Alan Beith suggested
that the next thing which should be done to let the voters sleep easier
in their beds was the introduction of proportional representation. The
DPM rather surprisingly roared that this would take us back to the Dark
Ages, asking us to believe that Attila the Hun was a Liberal Democrat.
Perhaps he meant to the confusion for which the Dark Ages are noted.
Labour kept on at him and Hezza, only six days away from a kidney
stone operation, looked a bit tired, so that one almost felt that ref
Betty should stop the fight.
But, as thoroughbred old warhorses can, he came good. Mr Martyn Jones
(Clwyd South-West -- Lab.) suggested that Mr Heseltine was costing the
taxpayer a lot of money and not doing much for it.
Only the other week, said Hezza grandly, he had brought the Siemens
#1bn investment to the North-east -- ''I think I am cheap at the
price''. It salvaged something even if it was the same line that some
Tory consultants have been using until Monday night.

PEERS last night rejected a call to follow the example of the Commons
and disclose details of payments made for consultancies and lobbying.
The call came from Labour's Lord Jenkins of Putney as the House
formally approved new arrangements to ban lobbying and to set up a
public register of members' financial interests.
Lord Jenkins told peers: ''While there is no necessity for the two
chambers to work in equity with each other in these matters or in the
same direction, it is at least desirable that we should take into
consideration what has happened elsewhere.''
Labour's Lord Boston of Faversham, Chairman of Committees, replied
that the Lords were ''in charge of their own procedures, quite
independently of what might or might not happen in the Commons''.
Peers decided in principle last week to break with centuries of
tradition and set up a register of financial interests.
Lord Boston confirmed to Liberal Democrat Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank,
a Griffiths committee member, that peers should declare relevant
financial interests before speaking on each day of a Bill's stages in
the Lords.
However, it would not be necessary to repeat the declaration each time
the peer spoke that day.
Lord Stoddart of Swindon (Lab) protested: ''This House has managed
without this sort of policy for the last 600 or 700 years.''
He added: ''The Prime Minister perhaps was driven too quickly, which
has led to the decisions we are taking today. By acting in haste, we may
very well be arriving at the wrong decisions at the wrong time and which
may have an adverse effect on Parliament and parliamentarians.''

COMMONS Speaker Betty Boothroyd yesterday severely censured a Tory MP
who accused Labour's Glenda Jackson of ''corruption'' in her use of
parliamentary facilities.
Mr David Shaw was told by Miss Boothroyd not to abuse the ''treasured
possession'' of freedom of speech and warned that a ''more drastic
course of action'' could follow if he did not heed her advice.
A bitter row broke out last week when Dover MP Mr Shaw claimed that Ms
Jackson (Hampstead and Highgate) had booked a Commons room for a Labour
Party meeting to discuss her #5500 sponsorship by train drivers' union
Aslef.
He alleged then that this was ''corrupt use of House of Commons
facilities''.
In a statement yesterday, Miss Boothroyd told MPs she had asked the
Serjeant at Arms to look into the use of stationery.
''Whatever the outcome of the inquiry, I do not believe that any of
the facts laid before me sustain the charge of corruption in the use of
parliamentary facilities.''
To loud Labour cheers, the Speaker told Mr Shaw, who sat stoney-faced
throughout: ''Free speech is one of this House's most treasured
possessions. For that reason, it must be used responsibly and not
abused.
''You should take careful note of that in future. I would much prefer
your co-operation in this than be compelled to any more drastic course
of action.''
Mr Shaw was involved in another row on Monday, when, to Opposition
protests, he accused Labour's Margaret Hodge of having a reputation for
''aiding and abetting child abuse''.
After being rebuked by the Speaker, Mr Shaw withdrew his allegation
against Mrs Hodge (Barking), who was leader of Islington Council when
council-employed social workers were at the centre of a child abuse
scandal.

MOVES to merge a committee of MPs investigating employment were
criticised on both sides in the Commons last night, with a senior Tory
accusing Ministers of trying to fob off the problem of the jobless.
The Commons backed amalgamation of the Education and Employment select
committees in line with Mr Major's decision in the summer to combine the
two ministries under Gillian Shephard.
Labour's Greville Janner (Leicester West), Employment Select Committee
chairman, protested: ''It's all part of a confidence trick by the
Government in an attempt to remove the attention of the public from the
reality of the existing and totally unacceptable unemployment.''
Employment Select Committee member Tory Sir Ralph Howell (Norfolk
North) protested: ''Unemployment is the biggest problem confronting the
advanced world and trying to hide it in another ministry won't solve the
problem at all.''
He warned: ''The Government is doing itself no service in trying to
fob off the problem of unemployment as if because it's falling a little
bit all is well.
''All is not well with 2.25 million people doing nothing and costing,
even on Government figures, #11.4bn, which is a total waste because
society gets nothing in return for it.''
THE Equal Opportunities Commission and the Commission for Racial
Equality are bracing themselves for ''massive'' cuts to pay for
Government tax cuts, according to the staff unions. The National Union
of Civil and Public Servants and the Civil and Public Services
Association disclosed that both of the equality agencies had been told
to expect budget cuts of at least 5% in the November 28 Budget. They
point out that, as the 20th anniversary of the Sex Discrimination and
Equal Pay Acts approaches, such cuts would make it more difficult to
help in fighting against inequality.
SPENDING of #1.6m on refurbishing cafeterias and kitchens at
Parliament came under fire last night. Labour left-winger Dennis Skinner
(Bolsover) said more should be done to provide facilities for the public
visiting the Houses of Parliament. It had been disclosed that #1.6m was
spent on the Members' and Strangers' cafeterias and kitchen and the
Speaker's state kitchen this year, and this was part of a seven-year
modernisation programme for cafeterias, kitchens, bars and dining rooms
in the Commons approved last July by MPs. Mr Skinner said the #1.6m was
the tip of the iceberg and he had heard the total for work over this
year's summer break was nearer #30m. He said: ''The Establishment can
always find money when it is providing facilities in Parliament.''
ALAN HOWARTH, the Tory MP who defected to Labour last month, will not
defend his present seat at the next General Election. He has been told
by Labour officials that he will have to find another constituency which
has not yet found a candidate. Mr Howarth, member for Stratford-on-Avon,
said yesterday he ''deeply regretted'' not being able to stand there.
''I'm afraid I was not eligible to be considered because they were very
well down the track as far as selecting their candidate.''
BRITAIN will not be given any information from the current French
nuclear weapons testing programme, the Government insisted last night.
Ministers have refused to join international condemnation of the three
recent French tests in the South Pacific. Defence Procurement Minister
James Arbuthnot said in a Commons written reply last night: ''We have
neither asked for, nor been offered, information or data resulting from
the current French test programme.''

THE mother of a young woman who died within hours of taking part in
stage hypnosis promised last night to fight on to have such acts banned,
despite an official report which found little evidence of serious risk.
The report, by a panel of experts set up by the Home Office amid fears
that people were being harmed, concluded: ''There is not enough evidence
of serious risk to the public to warrant banning stage hypnotism.''
However, it called for controls to be tightened, recommending that
consideration should be given to toughening licensing arrangements and
giving people more information about potential risks.
There was a delighted reaction from leading hypnotist Paul McKenna,
who said: ''This report only confirms what all the genuine experts
already knew -- that stage hypnosis is perfectly safe when conducted
properly and poses no danger to anyone.''
However, Mrs Margaret Harper, who founded the Campaign Against Stage
Hypnosis after her daughter Sharron Tabarn died within hours of taking
part in a club act, insisted she would fight on to have it banned.
''There is no way we can bring Sharron back, but one day we will stop
anyone else being traumatised by hypnosis,'' she said.
Mrs Harper, of Hesketh Bank, near Preston, added: ''I am very, very
disappointed at this moment, but we are still going to campaign and this
is going to make us even stronger in our resolve. We have to go for a
complete ban.''
The report recommends that the present licensing arrangements and
guidelines to local authorities should be revised, including:
* Consideration of licensing private performances which are currently
exempt from licensing.
* Clearer guidance on exemptions for performances for ''scientific or
research purposes.''
* More information for audiences on the small risks of participation
in stage hypnosis.
* Clearer guidance on precautions to be taken to minimise those risks.
The experts said: ''Those cases where serious harm has occurred are
extremely few in number and only some of these have been demonstrated to
have been caused by the prior participation in stage hypnosis. Some may
have been caused or triggered largely, or entirely, by other factors.''
Thousands of people took part each year, but only a small number of
cases had been put forward alleging physical or psychological damage.
It was important that people should be made aware of the possibility
of unpleasant side-effects, though the experts pointed out that most
people who took part found it enjoyable and entertaining and suffered no
ill-effects.
Mr McKenna said: ''This report should now bring to an end the campaign
by those people that have cashed in on the fears of the general public,
fears that their own campaign has effectively served to create.
''I hope that the media in turn will now cease to report often
hysterical news stories and stop supporting populist and bogus campaigns
which have no factual foundation.''
However, Mrs Harper said: ''I have spent a phenomenal amount of money
conducting this campaign and it's most offensive to say we have cashed
in on this.''
She said the cases in the report were only the ''tip of the iceberg''
and there were many people who had suffered who had not come forward.
Her daughter, 24, was brought out of a trance by a hypnotist by being
told to imagine 10,000 volts of electricity going through her.
An inquest returned a verdict of death by natural causes.

A CHINESE trade delegation is in Scotland with a #4000m list of
pollution control equipment they want to buy. Scotland is one of only
four European countries that the 13-member delegation from China's
National Environmental Protection Agency is visiting.
''Persuading the delegation to come to Scotland is a major coup,''
said Mr David Taylor, director of the Government agency Scottish Trade
International.
''Environmental projects in China are very hard to target due to lack
of funding. The attraction of the projects that this delegation is
bringing is that many will have guaranteed funding.''
The Chinese agreed to visit Scotland only after seven months of talks
with STI representatives in Beijing and Glasgow.
Firms being visited during the five-day trip include engineering
concerns Howden's, Weir Pumps, and Mitsui Babcock, as well as pollution
control and water companies including Tritton, Begg Cousland, and Crouch
Hogg Waterman.
Weir has been trading successfully with China for the past 20 years,
winning multi-million-pound orders to supply equipment for power
generation and water and sewage treatment.
A spokesman said China was a vast market with an economy growing by
10% a year.

<HEADLINE>Inquiry call on troops' injections. MoD response on 'Gulf war syndrome' attacked</HEADLINE>

THE Government's response to sufferers of so-called ''Gulf war
syndrome'' has been characterised by ''scepticism, defensiveness and
general torpor'', according to a highly critical report by the all-party
Commons Defence Select Committee.
The MPs claim the Ministry of Defence has shown a distinct lack of
compassion to the Servicemen and women who took part in the Gulf war,
700 of whom have since reported a variety of illnesses which have left
some of them incapacitated.
In its report, published yesterday, the select committee calls on the
Government to investigate the ''cocktail'' of vaccinations administered
to British troops to protect them against Iraqi chemical weapons.
It accepts the claim that no proof has yet been found to connect
service in the Gulf with the illnesses reported, but the MPs argue that
''this merely reflects the absence of thorough research or statistical
analysis''.
It also calls on the Government to provide the funding for more
research. The MPs urge the MoD ''to identify, with a degree of urgency
not hitherto displayed, those areas where further research is required;
and to provide sufficient funding to enable this vital work to be
carried out.''
The MPs criticise the MoD for offering only one site -- in Wiltshire,
for the Medical Assessment Programme it established, under public and
parliamentary pressure -- to examine those veterans who have reported
problems.
''There is little reason why some of the assessments could not have
been carried out at a second location, in the north of England, where
many of the veterans are based,'' the report states.
0 Liberal Democrat Defence spokesman Menzies Campbell, a member of the
committee, accused the MoD of playing down the seriousness of the
problem. ''Their response to complaints of Gulf war syndrome has been
grossly inadequate,'' he said.
''The MoD has behaved as if it were more concerned with the threat of
mitigation than with the truth. Insufficient resources were allocated
for investigation of the illness and this has been a depressing
situation for the plight of the victims.''
About 700 British veterans of the 1991 war are demanding compensation
or war pensions for illnesses they claim were caused by their service
and the drugs they received to protect them against biological and
chemical warfare. One soldier received nine injections in a day,
including ones against anthrax and bubonic plague.
The report found that in France, which did not innoculate its troops
before the war, no cases of Gulf war syndrome were reported. In the
United States, which innoculated all its troops, one in three veterans
has reported problems. In Britain those affected account for just 1% of
British forces in the Gulf.
Symptoms include severe weight and memory loss, chronic fatigue,
dizziness, swollen joints, depression and lack of concentration. In
addition, it is claimed that 40 Gulf War babies were born with rare
abnormalities.
The committee was particularly scathing about the difference between
the American and British Governments' responses to the problem.
''Whereas the US administration, at all levels, has displayed
compassion for those affected, a commitment to finding the best
treatments for them and a determination to investigate the possibility
of a common cause, the MoD's response has been reactive rather than
proactive and characterised throughout by scepticism, defensiveness and
general torpor.''
Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames rejected most of the report's
conclusions and dismissed it as ''unhelpful and disappointing''. He
said: ''Everything possible that can be done has been done and will be
done. We retain an open mind on this issue and we are certainly not
complacent.
''We are anxious for the health of our Servicemen and women and we
will continue to provide first-class care and attention for them. We now
know the scale of Saddam Hussein's chemical and biological weapons
programme. What would have happened if we had not provided this
protection for our Servicemen and women?''
However, Labour's Shadow Defence Secretary David Clark accused the MoD
of having failed British Gulf War veterans. ''Our troops risked their
lives for our country but all the MoD has done is sweep this issue under
the carpet. The MoD has failed our veterans. Our armed forces deserve
something better,'' he said.
Gulf War veterans welcomed the committee's findings but attacked the
Ministry of Defence for its ''ponderous and ill resourced'' treatment of
the problem so far.
They called on the Government to act immediately to fund adequate
investigation of Gulf war-related illnesses.
Solicitors Donn and Co representing the ''syndrome'' victims said that
680 veterans have registered claims for compensation for the illness.
A total of 412 have applied for war pensions since the hostilities
ended, of whom 216 have been granted pensions.
However, none has been granted anything for Gulf War syndrome, with
all the veterans receiving their pensions on the basis that they have
another identified illness.
Solicitor Hilary Meredith of Donn and Co said 40 babies have been born
with congenital abnormalities to parents who served in the Gulf and
other couples have been advised not to start families.
She said: ''We welcome the MoD findings that medical assessment for
Gulf war Syndrome has, so far, seemed hopelessly inadequate.
Mr Eddie Blench of the Gulf Veterans' Association described the
committee report as ''A major triumph for all the veterans in this
country.''
Veteran Paul Ash, 28, from Northumberland, who served in the Third
Battalion of Fusiliers as a Lance-corporal during the Gulf war and is
now a spokesman for the GVA, described his suffering since the war.
He said: ''As soon as I returned home, I had abdominal pains and pains
in the muscles of my legs, and I kept vomiting all the time and had
stomach problems.
''I have been medically assessed and given a war pension, but they
don't say it's for Gulf war Syndrome
''I'm really glad that this report has come out and hopefully it will
prompt the MoD to conduct some decent and proper investigations into the
problem.''
Another veteran, Tony Flint, 48, of London, told how he had been
warned by doctors not to have children after serving as a private in the
Gulf.
Since returning from the Gulf War he has suffered asthma, post
traumatic stress disorder, nerve damage to his shoulder neck and arm and
a glandular fever-related virus and has undergone a personality change,
leaving him unable to work.
He said: ''My GP doesn't know how to treat me because she doesn't know
what has gone into my body.''
* A petition signed by about 13,000 people on behalf of Navy veterans
who claim to have contracted terminal disease from exposure to asbestos
on warships was presented in the Commons last night.
The ex-Servicemen allege they were exposed to the deadly material in
the 1940s, '50s and '60s, said David Jamieson, Labour MP for Plymouth
Devonport, who delivered the document.

IS the letting side of housing going upmarket? The question is
prompted by the fact that some really interesting properties are coming
forward at the moment.
''The answer has to be yes,'' says Ronnie Carpenter, letting manager
with Slater Hogg Letting in Glasgow. ''And I would say there is a
definite change in people's attitude.
''Rental has become a first choice for many. They have decided that
they don't particularly want to buy -- not at the present, and not for a
variety of reasons.
''It may be the general economic situation. Or it doesn't suit their
particular arrangements -- they are looking for a variety of experience
in their chosen work, and don't want to be tied down to one place.
''This is certainly the view of those on the professional side who
come to the west of Scotland and want to be able to walk in to a
property. No hassle. No fuss. They want a place that is really a
home-substitute. Good quality, to meet their needs.
''And they are looking not just for high standards but for properties
with a difference.''
That could include the church conversion in Milngavie, where the
former show flat, on two levels, is currently on offer. With luxurious
fittings -- and private parking -- it is handy for commuting to Glasgow,
or escaping to the countryside.
There is a door entry system, hallway, lounge, dining area, two
bedrooms, kitchen, en suite shower room, study, and main bathroom.
Rental is #850 a month.
Another option would be a ranch-type bungalow by Larkhall, in a third
of an acre of ground. Two public rooms, four bedrooms, and one en suite
arrangement. And you have your own gardener coming in to keep the place
neat and tidy. All for #650 a month.
As an alternative, try a mature sandstone lodge house down by Gourock,
on the outskirts of town, handy for commuting but literally only minutes
from the shore front.
You get a vestibule with cloakroom, a large hallway, lounge, family
room, kitchen, three bedrooms, and bathroom with four-piece suite.
Gas-fired central heating -- by LPG, as it happens -- plus double
glazing. Level gardens, and all within a private estate .
Erskine can offer a detached villa of around 3000sq ft, with lounge,
family room, dining room, kitchen, utility room and downstairs toilet,
four bedrooms and main bathroom upstairs. Plus full gas-fired central
heating, and an integral garage. It comes, unfurnished, at #750 a month.
Going into town, Queens Park is always a popular area. There is a
refurbished lower conversion available, with some natural wood features,
a formal lounge, two bedrooms, dining kitchen and bathroom, with
gas-fired central heating. It goes for #550 a month.
Kilmacolm has a stone-built semi-detached cottage, close by the M8,
with lounge, kitchen, double bedroom and bathroom, for #400 a month.

A TELEVISION documentary, which portrays west and central Scotland as
fundamentally split by sectarian hatred, last night united Celtic and
Rangers in opposition to the programme.
After watching a preview, Celtic's chief executive Fergus McCann
pulled out of a discussion programme which will follow the documentary.
Rangers confirmed that their long-standing position of having nothing to
do with the project would be upheld.
The hour-long programme, Football, Faith, and Flutes, is to be
screened on Sunday night as part of the Channel 4 Witness series. It
contains footage of supporters during a recent Old Firm derby, shows
rival Republican and Loyalist marching bands, and follows two Roman
Catholic and Protestant families in Lanarkshire.
The film is the result of an 18-month project by Glasgow-based
production company Wark Clements, which was commissioned by the channel.
In it, interviewees express hardline sectarian viewpoints, with one
saying: ''The only difference between Scotland and Ulster is that there
are no guns on the street.''
After withdrawing his participation, Mr McCann issued a statement
condemning the programme as ''an insult''. He said: ''Rather than being
a balanced presentation, it is a gross caricature of the extremist
attitudes of unfortunate individuals.
''They do not represent the mainstream of supporters in Glasgow or
elsewhere. The result is a manipulated example of 'tabloid television'
which responsible people should deplore.''
Mr McCann was to have appeared on a discussion panel after the
broadcast which features MP George Galloway, Bishop Joseph Devine, the
Rev Andrew McLellan, Scottish Orange Order secretary Jack Ramsay, and
senior Republican and Unionist politicians from Northern Ireland.
Rangers director Donald Findlay, QC, who also was to have appeared as
an individual and not as a club representative, withdrew earlier this
week through work committments. Yesterday, Rangers refused to comment on
the programme.
However, the programme's producer, Mr Alan Clements, husband of
television presenter Kirsty Wark, said: ''It is an honest appraisal of
sectarianism in Scotland. It is the great untold story and it seems to
be in no-one's interests to talk about it.''
He called the stance of the Old Firm clubs' ''disappointing''.
During the making of the film, Mr Clements said he had received
serious threats and had his car vandalised.
Glasgow City Council leader Pat Lally joined in the condemnation of
the programme. He said it portrayed only negative aspects of the city
and did not represent the views of the great majority of citizens.
A spokesman for the Scottish Football League, which refused the
programme makers access to film within Scottish grounds, said: ''These
views have nothing to do with the vast majority of supporters. It is a
kick in the teeth.''

THE Princess of Wales yesterday met a paralysed schoolgirl who wrote
an inspiring letter to Superman actor Christopher Reeve after he was
left paralysed by a horse-riding accident.
The princess -- patron of the International Spinal Research Trust --
chatted with 11-year-old Gemma Quinn in a private room at Liverpool's
Anglican cathedral.
After the meeting -- which lasted several minutes -- Gemma said: ''She
is dead nice. She's tall, isn't she?
''She was lovely. It was weird meeting her. She doesn't seem like a
princess -- she is a human being. I liked her, she's like anyone else
with a busy life.''
The girl's father, computer programmer Mike Quinn, 36, mother Jackie,
33, and sister Gillian, 14, were introduced to the princess, along with
Gemma's care assistant Michelle Lomax, 20, who the family describe as
''Gemma's hands and arms''.
Mrs Quinn said: ''She teased us about the clothes we were wearing and
asked, 'Is black the family colour? It looks like a crows' outing'.
''She had us all laughing and put us at our ease immediately.''
In contrast, the princess was wearing an apricot knee-length suit with
matching black accessories.
Mr Quinn said: ''She knew all about Gemma's letter to Christopher
Reeve and said she thought Gemma had a lot of courage as well.''
''As she was leaving, she told her, 'You have a lot of courage' and
squeezed her leg.''
Gemma was left paralysed by a car accident four years ago but has
taught herself to swim using her neck muscles and this year began as a
pupil at Liverpool's Broad Green comprehensive school.
Next year, she will host the Liverpool to Southport stage of the Push
2000 Land's End to John O'Groats fundraising journey by three
paraplegics for the ISRT.
The aim is to raise #500,000 towards a #6m target to develop treatment
which it is hoped will overcome the ''permanence of paralysis''.

<HEADLINE>Leader jailed for assaulting four teenage Scouts</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A SCOUT leader has been jailed for 18 months for molesting teenage
boys from his troop.
Peter Atkins, 25, preyed on four boys between 1990 and 1993, when he
was an assistant Scoutleader.
He was jailed by Sheriff Iain Macphail QC at Edinburgh Sheriff Court
yesterday.
''These are serious offences, made all the more grave by the position
of trust in which you were placed,'' said the sheriff.
Atkins had earlier admitted four charges of sexual assault involving
the boys, aged 16, 14, 17 and 13.
He failed to escape prison despite a plea by his advocate, Mr Raj
Jandoo, that Atkins did not want to be homosexual and had adopted a
''strict Christian lifestyle'' in a bid to change.
The court heard at an earlier hearing that Atkins, of Steele Avenue,
Dalkeith, attacked the boys when they were sleeping in the same room as
him.
Depute-fiscal Pamela Watson said the boys were woken by Atkins
touching them through their sleeping bags or underwear.
On one occasion, the victim had gone to a campsite near Dumfries with
Atkins but the trip was cut short when he was woken by Atkins molesting
him in their two-man tent.
The teenager locked himself in Atkins' car for the rest of the night
and insisted that the assistant Scoutleader drove him home in the
morning.
Another of Atkins' victims could not bring himself to talk about his
ordeal for two months before eventually confiding in his sister. She
confronted Atkins but he denied everything.
The youngest victim displayed behavioural problems after being abused
and his mother eventually went to the police.
Police investigations also turned up the other incidents but, when
interviewed, Atkins refused to answer questions on the advice of his
solicitor.
Mr Jandoo said Atkins was ''deeply sorry'' about the offences.
Before they came to light, he had gone to his own GP seeking
psychiatric help but a psychiatric report before the court revealed that
Atkins did not have any treatable disorder.
Mr Jandoo told Sheriff Macphail that Atkins drank heavily due to
problems at home and that alcohol brought out the homosexual feelings
with which he was struggling to cope.
He now no longer drinks, has a girlfriend he hopes to marry, and has
weekly counselling sessions with his pastor at the Christian Centres
Ministries in Edinburgh.

<RECORDNO>975487164</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BBC news chiefs yesterday sparked a row by claiming that the
corporation had established a massive dominance over ITV and Channel 4
in TV news and current affairs.
Taking the whole range of news and current affairs programmes
together, the BBC had almost two-thirds of the total audience, they
claimed.
While the BBC's news and current affairs programming was expanding
fast, the independent terrestrial channels' coverage was ''in decline'',
said the corporation's managing director of news and current affairs, Mr
Tony Hall.
There was an angry reaction from ITV and Channel 4, who accused the
BBC of making dubious and misleading claims based on selective
statistics.
Comparing like with like, ITV programmes like The Cook Report, World
in Action, and News at Ten were well ahead of their BBC counterparts in
the ratings, insisted Mr Stuart Prebble, ITV controller of factual
network programmes.
The BBC's figures show that its share of the total news and
current-affairs audience has increased by 11% in the past two years to
63%, compared with 37% for ITV and Channel 4 combined.
The rise in the BBC share has coincided with an increase of 34 hours a
month devoted to news and current affairs.
Mr Hall said: ''These figures prove that we are the only provider of
serious, wide-ranging current affairs in the UK.''
Mr Prebble dismissed the accusation, commenting: ''It is very sad --
as well as somewhat mystifying -- to see a great organisation like the
BBC indulging in a propaganda exercise based on half-truths,
distortions, extremely selective research data, and misleading
comparisons.
''When an objective analysis is made, comparing like with like, it is
self evident that ITV's news and current affairs programmes are well
ahead of the BBC's and that our commitment has never been stronger.''
Mr David Lloyd, senior commissioning editor for news and current
affairs at Channel 4, said: ''The BBC should be ashamed of itself for
pretending it is 'the only provider of serious, wide-ranging current
affairs in the UK'.''

A DRIVER who killed two boys after he fell asleep at the wheel was
fined #200 for careless driving yesterday.
The devastated families of friends Gareth Horton, 14, and Gavin
Parsons, 17, of South Elmsall, West Yorkshire, attacked the penalty as
''disgusting''.
Mr James Inglis, 52, hit the army cadet friends after dozing off. He
had volunteered to work a fortnight of 12-hour shifts at a tractor
factory to pay for his daughter's wedding in Kenya.
He was fined #200 by Pontefract magistrates in West Yorkshire after he
admitted careless driving.
The assembly worker was also fined #360 for having no insurance. He
was ordered to pay court costs of #50. His licence was endorsed with
eight penalty points.
Inglis, of Stockingate, South Kirkby, West Yorkshire, told police he
had fallen asleep at the wheel.
''I was driving up the road towards home. I think I fell asleep. I
cannot remember anything except a loud bang,'' he told police.
He said he had driven with the window open and the demister on in an
attempt to ward off drowsiness.
Outside the court, Gareth's father, David, 44, with ex-wife Maureen,
42, and their 21-year-old daughter Debbie, by his side, called for a
change in the law.
He said the family was taking legal advice but criticised the fine.
''I am absolutely devastated. There is no justice in this decision
whatsoever,'' he said.
''I am absolutely disgusted. We've had no support from the Crown
Prosecution Service, the coroner, the police or the law. My boy's life
seems to be worth just #100.''
Mrs Horton added: ''It's a terrible decision but it is too late now,
whatever changes will not bring back my son.''
Gavin's father, Mr Leslie Parsons, 52, also an HGV driver, said: ''In
my opinion, he should have been charged at least with causing death by
dangerous driving. I always stop when I feel tired. It is the law for
HGV drivers -- there should be a similar law for car drivers.''
Gavin and Gareth were walking along Minsthorpe Lane, South Elmsall,
with their Army cadet friends Timothy Benwinter, 16, and Neil Dickinson,
14, when Inglis's Toyota Tercel veered on to the pavement and hit the
group.
Mr Thomas Klouda, prosecuting, said Timothy and Gareth were thrown
over the wall. Timothy had serious leg and arm injuries but Gareth died
from head injuries later that day.
Gavin also received serious head injuries and died in the
neurosurgical unit at Leeds General Infirmary a week later.
Mr Klouda said police investigations showed Inglis was driving about
30 to 35 mph.
Mr Gordon Richardson, defending, reminded the magistrates that Inglis
was facing only a charge of careless driving because he was not speeding
and his driving had been good before he fell asleep.
''Your responsibility is to judge this defendant as to the quality of
his driving that night and not the terrible consequence of it,'' Mr
Richardson said.
Inglis had bought the car just 10 days before but had been unable to
insure it because he was spending all his time at work, he said.
Magistrates chairman, Mr Andrew Hancocks, said: ''We are here today to
adjudicate on a charge of driving without due care and attention. Our
penalties are based only on the charge before us. We are taking into
account your guilty plea and your ability to pay any financial penalty
we impose.''
Outside court, Inglis said of the youngsters who died: ''I'm
shattered. I don't think I shall ever drive again.
''I can understand the families' grief and anger. I'm so sorry, I
don't know what else to say.''
The Crown Prosecution Service yesterday defended the charge brought
against Inglis.
Mr Richard Cragg, spokesman for the CPS's North area, said: ''While we
have every sympathy for the families involved, the file was reviewed at
a senior level and in accordance with the code for Crown Prosecutors.
''We have to select the most appropriate charge based on the evidence
available.''

EVERTON hope Scottish football chiefs will shelve a 12-match ban on
jailed striker Duncan Ferguson at an appeals tribunal today in Glasgow.
Manager Joe Royle and chairman Peter Johnson visited the former
Rangers player at Glasgow's Barlinnie Prison, where he is serving a
three-month sentence for an on-field assault.
They are hoping the Scottish Football Association will wipe out the
ban, 11 matches of which remain, or allow it to run concurrently with
the prison sentence.
''I feel very strongly that Duncan should be only punished once,''
said Johnson.
''If a thug knocks an old lady down in the street and is sent to jail
no-one says he must serve another punishment when he comes out. And when
the SFA set the ban they didn't know about the three-month sentence.''
The three-man tribunal comprises independent chairman MP Menzies
Campbell, SFA President Bill Dickie or his nominee, and a representative
of the Scottish Professional Footballers' Association.
Meanwhile, Ferguson, who is expected to be released from jail before
the end of this month, has issued a message of thanks to Everton fans
from his prison cell.
The striker said: ''I have been overwhelmed by the fantastic support I
have received from Everton fans everywhere.
''It has helped to keep my spirits up through this most difficult
period in my life. I feel it is very important to tell people just how
much those messages have helped to lift my spirits.
''I didn't realise just how much I would miss football.
''Obviously, I have no special privileges here but I am trying to keep
as fit as I possibly can in the circumstances, '' revealed Ferguson in
last night's Liverpool Echo.

HERE is a treasurable house for an art lover. It is strongly connected
with two famous Scottish painters, a grandfather and grandson . . .
Standing in a large woodland garden at Loanhead, Midlothian, Hillwood
dates from the mid-nineteenth century. After it was bought by the
outstanding landscape painter William McTaggart (1835-1910) it stayed in
the family to become the childhood home of his grandson -- whose
importance in the Scottish art world saw him knighted as Sir William
McTaggart (1903-81).
Most of the principal rooms have bow-ended walls with large windows
overlooking the garden. The billiard room (used as a picture gallery by
the McTaggarts) is particularly impressive, with oak panelling and two
fireplaces.
That room apart, the accommodation comprises: hall, three reception
rooms, five bedrooms, two bathrooms, cloakroom, and kitchen. There is a
double garage, and outbuildings including a conservatory and two
greenhouses, one with a 100-year-old vine.
Approached on a private no-through road, Hillwood has been designated
a Conservation Area. Brodies of Edinburgh is seeking offers over
#340,000.

WORLD football chiefs yesterday denied they are to increase the size
of goals in order to boost the game's strike rate.
FIFA have told the International Board -- the body responsible for the
laws of the game -- to look at ways of increasing the number of goals
scored at their next meeting in March.
But while FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper admitted giving players a bigger
target was an option, he insisted: ''The chances of there being a change
of this magnitude before the 1998 World Cup are remote in the extreme.''
He added: ''FIFA have asked the International Board to come up with
suggestions, and it is possible experiments will then be conducted.
''We have a number of on-going experiments taking place at the moment.
Time-outs were used during the women's World Cup last summer and the use
of kick-ins rather than throw-ins has also being looked at.
''But procedures to change the laws of the game must be considered
carefully and therefore such developments come in very, very slowly.''
The possibility of increasing the height and width of goals is
examined in the BBC1 programme 'Here and Now' tonight (7.30).
The programme reports that the modern scoring rate is half that of a
century ago and producers even persuaded Scotland players to take part
in an experimental match using bigger goals.
Those used were a foot wider and higher to reflect the fact that
today's goalkeepers are, on average, 10 inches taller than those when
the laws of soccer were formulated in the 1860s.
Scotland manager Craig Brown said: ''I was disappointed players didn't
put as many shots on the new goal as I would have hoped. But we scored
goals which otherwise wouldn't have been.''
That was backed up by findings in tests conducted on Scottish
internationalists John McGinlay and Pat Nevin by Professor Adrian Lees
of the John Moore's University in Liverpool.
Both players improved their goal-ratio from three out of 10 to seven
out of 10 using the bigger goals.

PETER Wright will learn his fate today after a disciplinary hearing at
Murrayfield last night which will decide whether or not he plays against
Western Samoa in 11 days' time, writes Derek Douglas.
The Scotland prop was sent off by international referee Ken McCartney
during Boroughmuir's premiership match with Gala at Netherdale 10 days
ago.
Wright received his marching orders for what McCartney said was
''misconduct'' after having been involved in a number of verbal
exchanges with the referee.
A vacant slot has been left in the line-up to meet Western Samoa
depending on the result of the hearing.
Wright requested a personal hearing after receiving a copy of the
referee's report.
Last night, after the 10-minute appearance before the disciplinary
panel, Wright said: ''There wasn't much more to be said. They had the
referee's report and they had my statement. I've to phone them in the
morning and they'll tell me the result.''

EDINBURGH, who have the honour and the responsibility of first tilt at
the touring Western Samoans, have no intention of adopting a
safety-first approach -- which should mean a cracker of a match today.
The Samoans' acclimatisation continued yesterday as they worked out at
Inverleith, the venue for the tour opener (kick-off 2.0).
0 Meanwhile, Edinburgh's preparation has been hampered by injury and
the late call-off by Dougie Wyllie due to business commitments. In fact,
Edinburgh manager Rob Flockhart reckoned that about half of the listed
40 players are unavailable.
Nevertheless, he is confident that the side can give a good account of
themselves against the Samoans who, it has to be recalled, were World
Cup quarter-finalists.
Edinburgh are certainly equipped to do just that and none more so than
ameron Glasgow. The Herioter, who campaigned with Scotland through the
summer, still seeks that elusive first cap.
He failed to make the Scotland A side to play the Samoans because the
selectors considered that he was not yet match fit. Today, he has the
opportunity to prove them wrong.
Edinburgh -- N Mardon; D Macrae (both Boroughmuir), G Lawrie (Heriot's
FP), D Laird (Boroughmuir), C Glasgow (Heriot's FP); A Donaldson
(Currie), G Beveridge (Boroughmuir); R McNulty (Stewart's-Melville), P
Haslett (Edinburgh Academicals), S Paul (Heriot's FP), D Burns
(Boroughmuir), S Murray (Edinburgh Academicals), B Ward (Currie), T
McVie, G Dall (both Heriot's FP).
Replacements -- B Stewart (Edinburgh Academicals), A Cadzow
(Boroughmuir), D Clark (Stewart's-Melville FP), F McMillan (Heriot's
FP), L Graham (Biggar), F Henderson (Watsonians).
Western Samoa -- V Patu; B Lima, G Leaupepe, T Vaega, A Telea; C
Burnes, M Vaeaq; B Reidy, T Leiasamaivao, G Latu, P Leavasu, M
Birtwhistle, S Kaleta, P Lam, S Vaifela.
Replacements -- T Faaiuaso, S Leaegu, J Filemu, S Smith, T Leota, P
Fatialofa.
* NEGOTATIATIONS aimed at Newcastle securing the services of Gary
Armstrong and Doddie Weir are continuing. The Border duo, who were
offered six-figure, three-year contracts by Sir John Hall last week, are
almost certain to leave Melrose and Jed-Forest if a mutually acceptable
deal can be agreed.
Armstrong captains Scotland A against Western Samoa on Sunday while
Weir wins his thirty-third cap against the Samoans at Murrayfield on
Saturday week.
* THE Tennents SRU Premiership race, which was building up to a
last-gasp dash for the line by at least three clubs -- Boroughmuir,
Melrose, and Stirling County -- is forced into untimely abeyance on
Saturday due to the conflicting demands of representative rugby. All but
one of the country's top games have been postponed. Edinburgh
Academicals v Melrose goes ahead as scheduled.
Stirling County v Boroughmuir and Watsonians v Hawick will now be
played on December 2 as will the Melrose v Gala game scheduled for
Sunday, November 19, the postponement in this case being due to heavy
Melrose involvement in the Murrayfield Test match against Western Samoa
the previous day. The Gala v Heriot's game has been rescheduled for
December 9.

THE increasing part professionals from Sweden are playing on the PGA
European Tour was reflected yesterday in the nomination of Jarmo
Sandelin, aged 28 and born in Finland, as winner of the 1995 Sir Henry
Cotton Rookie of the Year Award.
Sandelin finished his first full season in twenty-first place on the
order of merit, having won #173,856 and captured the Canary Islands Open
in February.
Sandelin's delighted response was: ''It was unbelievable to win so
early in the year after going three times to the qualifying school and
finally making it through the Challenge Tour. Before that there had been
seven very lean years.''
He is the second Swede to have been selected, after Per-Ulrik
Johansson four years ago.

DUNFERMLINE have started negotiations with Finnish internationalist
Kari Rissanen from Finn-pa, Helsinki.
The defender is at East End Park on a fortnight's trial and played in
a Reserve League Cup tie against Arbroath.
Manager Bert Paton intends to play him against Clydebank on Saturday.
''He was impressive against Arboathm'' said the Dunfermline manager,
''and if he plays well against Clydebank I would hope to sign him.''
Paton's side is still plagued with injuries, the latest to be crocked
is winger Allan Moore, who will be side-lined on Saturday with a
hamstring problem. But midfielder Craig Robertson is expected to return.

HEARTS stole off down the M8 with a point in the hamper, their goal
intact, and their position above Motherwell in the league protected.
They may never get off as lightly again this season, however, if any
team dominates them as much as the Fir Park side did for virtually all
of the 90 minutes. The fact that the scoreline remained blank was down
to remarkable misses, fine goalkeeping, and a fair slice of capital good
fortune.
From beginning to end, Motherwell were the team with the positive
ideas, but they contrived to miss the opportunities they created and
when they did get through, French keeper Gilles Rousset was up to the
task.
Time and again waves of claret and amber rolled in towards the tall
keeper but he, Neil Berry, and the entire Tynecastle defence refused to
buckle.
In the end their resolution was rewarded, but don't try convincing any
of the Motherwell fans in the 5595 crowd -- their lowest attendance of
the season -- of that.
Already without two forwards, Tommy Coyne and Shaun McSkimming,
Motherwell had to count another two out because of injury, Dougie Arnott
and John Hendry, but you would not have guessed so as they played the
ball about with a confidence that belied their recent appalling record.
There were some impressive passing movements from the home team,
perhaps because Hearts seemed prepared to let them have the ball for a
while, but it was a rare error by John Robertson that almost let them in
to score before six minutes had passed.
The striker lost the ball to Alex Burns, whose pass was well weighted
towards Andy Roddie, who made room on his left and will be annoyed with
himself for not doing better from about 12 yards than shoot over.
Jamie Dolan was a big influence in midfield, in attack and on the rare
occasions when he needed to defend, and one superb, long, cross-field
pass to Roddie deserved a better finish than a mis-hit cross against a
defender.
The locals began to get a bit restless as time wore on. Alex Burns did
try to alter that with a header from a John Philliben cross but his
effort went well past.
Hearts very nearly stole a lead when they broke quickly and Gary Locke
sent in a hard, low shot that Scott Howie did well to touch for a
corner.
Burns was certainly having a go, as he demonstrated once more with a
fierce effort that went only a foot over, but Motherwell went in at the
interval wondering if and when they would score.
They were still wondering after two near things immediately on their
return. First, a cross-cum-shot by Paul Lambert was pushed away by
Rousset and then Roddie, given a shooting chance by Dolan, steered the
ball across goal and away from danger.
The Hearts survival reached incredible status when Motherwell's next
raid ended in a fortunate, if worthy, save by Rousset.
Roddie had done well to make room on the left and, when his knee-high
cross came over, Lambert met it about six yards out at full pace, but
the ball landed in the arms of the keeper.
It all got a bit too much for Jim Jefferies, who got just a bit too
angry when Hans Eskillson was pulled up for a foul, and suffered the
wrath of referee Willie Young, who raced over to give him a stern
lecture at the dugout.
Still, the relentless pressure on Hearts' goal went on but if the
Tynecastle side had contributed little in an attacking sense, they were
defending with great discipline.
All it needed was for them to sneak upfield, grab a goal and one of
the great travesties of the season would have been completed.
Motherwell tried to off-set such a snatch by bringing on young Irish
striker Roy Essandoh for Roddie. Before the new man had made contact
with the ball, however, he saw Eskillson nearly get past Howie with a
header that went over the bar.
Both managers seemed quite pleased. Motherwell's Alex McLeish was
disappointed that his team failed to score, but in every other way he
was delighted with their performance. ''We dominated from start to
finish and it's not often you do that in any game.''
For Jim Jefferies, the Hearts manager, the clean scoresheet was
another bonus. ''We have been losing goals and yet that's two games now
with nothing against us.''
MOTHERWELL -- Howie, Philliben, McMillan, Krivokapic, Martin, McCart,
Lambert, Dolan, Burns, Roddie, Davies. Substitutes -- Essandoh, I
Ritchie, Denham.
HEARTS -- Rousset, Locke, P Ritchie, Smith, Berry, Bruno, Johnston,
Eskillson, Robertson, Fulton, Millar. Substitutes -- Lawrence, O'Connor,
Jamieson.
Referee -- W Young (Clarkston).

A BID by the British Boxing Board of Control to have their
recently-introduced safety measures adopted world-wide will be put
before the annual convention of the World Boxing Council in Thailand
this week.
The tragic deaths of British boxers Bradley Stone and Jim Murray
prompted the BBBC to bring in a host of new measures, including
mandatory brain scans, longer suspensions for knocked-out boxers, and
earlier weigh-ins.
The WBC are also expected to discuss the great heavyweight controversy
surrounding title-holder Frank Bruno, fellow Britain Lennox Lewis and
Mike Tyson.
Lewis has taken his legal fight to the American courts, after losing
the verdict in London's High Court last week.
Bruno is expected to take on Tyson in Las Vegas on March 16, but Lewis
claims that he should be installed as the mandatory challenger following
the WBC's 1994 decision to make his fight with Lionel Butler an official
eliminator.
Lewis won the showdown with Butler in May, but the WBC now look likely
to allow Tyson a route to the title following his release from prison
earlier this year.

<HEADLINE>In-and-out-form does no-one any good. Gascoigne must let feet do the talking</HEADLINE>

THERE must be times when Paul Gascoigne does not know which way to
turn. Whatever he does or says becomes public knowledge either
immediately or gradually through the rumour factory which drip feeds the
gossips among us.
However, if he wishes to ease his load then all he has to do is
perform in Rangers' midfield. Perform like the footballer Rangers
thought they were buying, that is.
Gascoigne has played only spasmodically and has much more to give. He
must have, otherwise Terry Venables would not have listed him yesterday
in the England squad for next week's match against Switzerland.
No-one can hope to understand what goes on inside Gascoigne's head,
but when he is fully focused on his work, he becomes the player Walter
Smith wants to see, and if the Englishman is in the mood this evening,
Kilmarnock will have problems trying to subdue him and Rangers at Rugby
Park.
Yet, lately it has looked as though he is becoming more sluggish in
his work rather than sharper, although on Saturday a thigh injury
prevented him from playing against Falkirk, who play at Pittodrie
tonight.
He has recovered quickly and although Venables has the right to call
him to the English gathering on Saturday, he will play against Aberdeen
at Ibrox before travelling south, where the spotlight will fall on him
once again.
There will be no escape, so the sooner Gascoigne shuts everything out
and just plays the better.
While he has recovered, another midfield player, Stuart McCall, has
been injured again. He took a blow against Falkirk and aggravated the
rib-muscle problem which kept him out prior to that match, but Smith is
confident the player will be fit in time to play against Aberdeen.
''It is important for us to win both these matches to keep the
momentum in the league championship going,'' said Smith. ''Kilmarnock
had a good result on Saturday and they always compete well against us.
We will have to meet the challenge and make sure we stay at the top of
the division.''
Smith had hoped to sign Morton's Derek McInnes by now, but because of
the intricacies in the midfield player's contract, the deal continues to
be delayed. The signing could be completed today or later in the week,
but no-one can say for definite until Morton honour the terms of sale
which they agreed to with McInnes.
Smith is willing to let the matter run its course, and as more of his
players begin to emerge from periods of inactivity caused by injuries,
he can afford to wait. ''Players are returning and that might give me a
chance to spell some people who found that they were recovering from
injuries and having to play sometimes three times in little more than a
week,'' Smith said.
Andy Goram and Craig Moore are expected to be fit to play against
Aberdeen and Brian Laudrup and David Robertson could be ready in time to
play against Celtic next weekend.
Alex Totten will have to decide between the experience of veteran
keeper Bobby Geddes or the youthful Colin Meldrum because of the
automatic, one-match suspension imposed on Dragoje Lekovic, sent off on
Saturday against Raith Rovers. Meldrum, a 19-year-old former Scotland
youth cap, played four times in the first team last season.
''Obviously Bobby, who has played for us already this season, has all
the experience, but Colin is a great prospect,'' said Kilmarnock manager
Alex Totten.
The Rugby Park side have been lifted by recent performances after a
dreadful few months, and Totten added: ''It's a very happy dressing room
and everyone is looking forward to playing against Rangers.
''There will be a big crowd and the players can only respond well to
the kind of atmosphere which will be generated. Also, after having moved
up the division into sixth place, we have to go into this game with
confidence.''
The manager hopes to be able to include Colin McKee (ankle), Billy
Findlay (knee), and Mark Roberts (back) in his plans as all three appear
to have recovered, but Steve Maskrey, who has damaged a knee, has been
unable to train and will be left out.
The Dons, beaten 2-1 by Hibernian on Saturday, will have to do much
more if they want to satisfy their manager, Roy Aitken, who is a hard
taskmaster. ''I am looking for that bit extra from the players to turn
things around,'' he said before tonight's match against Falkirk.
''Falkirk are in good hands with people like John Lambie and Gerry
Collins in charge. Their team may be sitting at the bottom of the
division, but they know what it takes to pick up points.''
Scott Booth and Stewart McKimmie will be given fitness tests sometime
today, but Aitken is confident at least one of them will play. If Booth
is out, Duncan Shearer will start in only his second match of the
current campaign.
Teenager Michael Craig has been promoted to the first-team squad
because of his form since being signed from Celtic.

PAUL Ince, signed by Inter-Milan for #7m from Manchester United, has
struggled to fit in with the Italian side, and as a result England
manager Terry Venables has told the player he must organise himself
before he can be considered for recall to the England squad.
Venables, who yesterday announced his squad for next week's friendly
against Switzerland, insists he has not written off the 16-cap midfield
player but, after travelling to Genoa to watch and talk to him at the
weekend, he is not convinced -- on or off the field.
While fit-again David Platt and Paul Gascoigne were rehabilitated into
his plans, Ince is left fretting about his future with the clock
counting down to next summer's European Championship finals.
''If you take every player in the squad I'm sure they've all got some
problem or other where I may be able to help them,'' said the manager,
''but I'm afraid I cannot consider Paul the priority.''
Peter Beardsley was named yesterday, Stuart Pearce has been retained,
but John Barnes is still missing, although Venables insists there is
nothing sinister in that as he continues to look at young players like
Liverpool team-mates Jamie Redknapp and Steve McManaman, and fringe men
like Steve Stone and Gareth Southgate.
''John can come in at any stage, not only as a player but also because
of his involvement and experience,'' said the manager. ''He's playing
well -- as well as for a long time. I've spoken to Liverpool and he
knows how I feel.''
Venables has reinstated Tim Flowers and Graeme Le Saux plus Steve
Howey after injury. But the return of Gascoigne and David Platt, who can
provide goalscoring inspiration, pleases him most.
And Trevor Sinclair had double cause for celebration yesterday when
first he was named Carling Player of the Month for October, to be
followed by selection for the Switzerland game.
''I couldn't believe it at first,'' said the player, ''It seemed too
good to be true. Obviously there had been a lot of talk about England
calling me up but I didn't pay any attention to it.''
With Alan Shearer still favoured despite eight games without a goal,
Platt's return of 26 in 55 appearances is more than useful.

JUNINHO swaps the speed of the Premiership with Middlesbrough for the
white-hot atmosphere of the biggest game in South American football
today.
The #4.5m player, who made his English debut at the weekend against
Leeds, is expected to be wearing the No.10 shirt made famous by Pele
when Brazil face Argentina in Buenos Aires.
Juninho's international call means he will miss Middlesbrough's home
Coca-Cola Cup, third-round replay with Crystal Palace tonight -- and
'Boro are still hoping to persuade the Brazilian FA to allow the
22-year-old to miss an Olympic qualifying tournament in February and
March.
Brazil are insisting Juninho must be made available for their Under-23
squad's six-week assignment in Argentina -- and that means he could miss
eight games at a crucial stage of the season for Bryan Robson's side.
* INJURY has forced Liverpool striker Ian Rush to pull out of Wales'
squad for next week's European Championship qualifier against Albania in
Tirana.
Rush, left out of the team named by manager Bobby Gould last week, was
expected to make the journey as a coaching assistant. But he has now
withdrawn from the trip, explaining: ''I have a back and ankle injury.''
* JUVENTUS striker Gianluca Vialli has issued a plea to former
team-mate Roberto Mancini to stay in Italy after reports linked the
Sampdoria captain to a move to England.
Rumours that Mancini is ready to quit Serie A surfaced after he was
sent-off during Sampdoria's recent draw with Inter-Milan. Mancini was
booked for diving in the penalty area and then asked Sampdoria coach
Sven Goran Eriksson to substitute him.
The player has been linked with Arsenal, and as Sampdoria play the
London side at Highbury tomorrow, rumour has it that a deal could be
agreed then.
* JACK Charlton has recalled former Celtic defender Chris Morris to
the Republic of Ireland squad for next Wednesday's crucial European
Championship final qualifier in Portugal. A draw would put Portugal
through to the finals.

NASEEM Hamed has been forced to pull out of his defence of the World
Boxing Organisation featherweight title against unbeaten Mexican Arnulfo
Castillo at London Arena on December 9.
Hamed sustained a fractured right hand in training and a specialist
says he will not be able to fight before the end of January at the
earliest.
Now Bristol's Ross Hale and Londoner Paul Ryan top the bill in a
triple light-welterweight title fight. It is being moved to the smaller
arena, but still presents both men with a big chance to make the most of
prime-time exposure -- and press a claim for a WBO world championship
chance.
Hale, winner of 26 of his 27 contests, defends the British and
Commonwealth titles he retained with a second-round knock-out of Charlie
Kane 10 days ago.
''That didn't take much out of me,'' said Hale, ''so it's a chance to
keep busy as well as take another pay-day.''
Ryan defends the WBO Inter-Continental belt. He has won all his 21
professional bouts, although his rival has beaten better quality men.
Ryan said: ''It's a dream chance for me.''
* HERBIE Hide has decided to forego a #120,000 purse to challenge for
the European heavyweight title. Hide has withdrawn from his December 9
bout in Stuttgart against the Croatian holder, Zelkjo Mavrovic, because
he is not keen to fight in Germany.
It would have been Hide's first ring appearance since losing his WBO
title to Riddick Bowe in March, a fight which earned him #2m, and was
scheduled to support the Axel Schulz-Frans Botha clash for the vacant
IBF heavyweight championship.
Hide said: ''I didn't want to fight in Germany. I wanted the fight to
go ahead in front of my own fans in Norwich.''

THEY may not have made much of an impact on foreign fields, but
Rangers have impressed their rivals as far as their application to the
defence of their premier division title is concerned. Billy Stark,
assistant manager of Celtic, believes his own team would have been
leading the championship race in normal circumstances, having collected
24 points at this stage of the season.
''That would have been more than enough to have us at the top at this
time last year,'' he said, ''but Rangers have made a phenomenal start
and we will have to keep on winning to stay in the chase.''
From the start of the season, he and manager Tommy Burns have been
working on the philosophy that Celtic have to try to take maximum points
from games outwith Old Firm confrontations. ''Those games take care of
themselves, '' he said, ''and can go either way.''
The chances are Celtic will be unchanged against Raith Rovers at
Parkhead tonight after the side did well in the 2-0 defeat of Motherwell
at Fir Park on Saturday, although there is a doubt about Peter Grant,
who has bad blisters on his heels after playing in new boots. No-one
would have guessed Grant's discomfort at Fir Park, where he had perhaps
his best performance of the season.
John Collins, who was left out of the side for tactical reasons, may
have to play a back-up role again unless Grant is out, despite coming on
to score a memorable goal in the last minute. ''We have tremendous
competition in midfield,'' said the assistant manager, who announced the
same 14 as the weekend with the addition of Pat Bonner, Rudi Vata and
Stuart Gray, who has recovered from a knee injury.
The Parkhead management is delighted at the impact the young players
have had on the team and Stark indicated that they are now even adding a
''wee touch of arrogance'' to their play. Brian McLaughlin, Simon
Donnelly and Jackie McNamara have helped bring a new dimension to the
side and will be expected to keep up the good work against Rovers.
Psychologically, Raith went into free-fall after their marvellous
efforts against Bayern Munich a week ago and it was probably no great
surprise that they lost their way at Kilmarnock, although the 5-1 result
was exceptional.
Manager Jimmy Nicholl had resisted the temptation to tell his players
what he thought of that display in the circumstances. ''No-one is worse
than me in defeat, but too many good things have happened to this club
to spoil it all by bawling them out. We have enjoyed our European
adventure, but that is now in the past. I have decided to give them the
benefit of the doubt and let them start afresh.''
He will ask for a hard night's shift at Parkhead to redeem reputations
after the debacle at Rugby Park. Shaun Dennis is fit again after injury,
but Mark Buist is out.
Hibs, who are motoring along in great style just behind the two
leaders, will be expected to collect three points at home to Partick
Thistle but will remember the first game of the season at Firhill, where
they outplayed Thistle but managed only a draw.
Manager Alex Miller has no fresh injury problems but points out that
the long-term injured, Willie Miller, David Farrell, Mickey Weir, Graham
Mitchell and Andy Millen, may have a job getting back in if the
replacements keep up the good work.
Thistle's manager, Murdo MacLeod, who was Miller's assistant not so
long ago, would love the choice that his old boss has, even without the
injured division, but must soldier on with the limited pool at his
disposal. He will have Tommy Turner back after the flu and asks only
that his players give him their all.
''If they do that and lose I can accept, it but anything less is no
good to me,'' said McLeod.

MONDAY'S vote by MPs in favour of disclosing earnings relating to
their Parliamentary work was welcome, particularly the larger than
expected majority supporting it.
Personally, I cannot see the problem with disclosure unless there is
something unsavoury that individuals would prefer to keep hidden. Maybe
when some constituents realise the extent of external earnings for
particular MPs they will wonder how they find time to represent their
constitutents.
There are parallels with the business world in that certain people
appear as non-executive directors on several boards picking up in excess
of #10,000 in each case. Shareholders may wonder if the companies are
well served by such individuals but the financial performance of the
companies in question is visible to all.
Most responsible large public companies publish details of the
salaries of named directors in their annual reports. Many of them also
disclose whether or not they make political donations.
In seeking to prevent paid advocacy MPs are not prevented from
listening to the views of outside lobbyists, something which they have
done throughout history. The only difference now is that lobbying has
become a huge industry in its own right with organisations both in the
private and public sector, including charities, feeling it necessary to
employ Parliamentary advisers and lobbyists to get their views across to
MPs both in the UK and, increasingly, in Continental Europe.
The run-up to the Budget always produces a flurry of activity from
various vested interests keen to make their voices heard and hopefully
secure preferential treatment from the Chancellor. Detailed proposals
are published by a variety of organisations including the Society of
Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the Brewers &amp; Licensed Retailers
Association. Other bodies such as charities and think-tanks also make
their views known.
For example, the Adam Smith Institute has with cross-party support
called on the Chancellor to cut alcohol taxes in the Budget. It argues
that relatively high excise duties in the UK encourage smuggling and
undermine the domestic drinks industry.
Everyone expects such lobbying to happen and there is no problem as
long as it all remains visible and above board.
MPs can take comfort from the fact that the vast majority of the
public would not want them to have no interests outside Parliament. As
it is, the vast majority of MPs are already quite out of touch with what
people want. Far from seeking to curb their income, there are many who
would support an increase in their salaries to properly reflect the job
the best of them do.
It is only when an individual appears to step completely out of line
that public concern is expressed. This was the case with Cedric Brown,
chief executive of British Gas, who was catapulted from relative
obscurity in the financial world to national prominence when he received
a 71% increase in salary and benefits at a time when British Gas was
cutting staff and reducing customer service.
There are many high earning company executives such as Marks &amp;
Spencer's Sir Richard Greenbury, who earned #807,000 last year, who fail
to attract public approbrium. They are seen to be doing a good job in
responsibly managing the interests of all the stakeholders in the
business: shareholders, customers and suppliers.
Politicians and utility company bosses have shared a similar drop in
their level of public esteem. Both have appeared to have their
proverbial snouts in the trough.
The actions of a few have given the majority a bad name. Once lost it
is hard to win back public support, particularly given the generally
higher levels of cynicism with which most of us regard those in
leadership roles whether in the public or private sector.

MEMBERS of one of the least-well-off sectors of the farming industry
are to be asked to find an additional #1m to promote their products next
year, writes VICTOR ROBERTSON.
This follows the decision by the Meat and Livestock Commission's pork
and bacon promotion council to increase promotional spending from #7.5m
in the current year to #8.4m from next April. It will mean an increase
in the bolt-on levy from 54p to 60p per pig.
Council chairman Jim Macaulay said this was essential to continue the
improvement in pig meat sales seen in the last two years largely through
the Recipe for Love television advertisements.
More cash is also being directed at the fast-developing catering
sector which accounts for 29% of all pig meat sales and at new product
development.
Reduced pig slaughterings in the current year have cut the total
planned budget by #100,000 but this has been spread over all activities,
leaving the television advertising spend at #2.8m with a further #1m on
trade promotion back-up.

THE Scottish Pride Shareholders' Association, which was left with a
legal bill of #20,000 after it raised a challenge at the annual general
meeting to the way the company was being run, is to continue its
existence.
Robin Christie of the Dourie Farming Company, Fort William, who is
chairman of the association, said a general meeting of members had
expressed a strong desire that it remain in being.
''There was a general view among those representing shareholders from
across a wide geographic area that the association could fill a valuable
role by promoting a greater two-way understanding of the views of
shareholders on the one hand and the directors and management on the
other,'' he said.
Scottish Pride, which has its headquarters in Govan, is a major player
in the milk and cheese markets in Scotland. Before deregulation last
year it was the manufacturing and retailing arm of the old Scottish Milk
Marketing Board.
Mr Christie said the company was unusual in that is had relatively
large numbers of small shareholders, most of them dairy farmers
representing continuing producer interest. Nobody could more
democratically represent them than their elected spokesmen.
Murray Rhind from Wigtown, a retired dairy farmer and secretary of the
association, said it had about 250 members. ''It is our wish to be
constructive rather than confrontational,'' he said.
''The company chairman, Lord Sanderson, has been speaking of the
possibility of a rights issue to raise additional capital for the
development of the business. There could be a role for the shareholders'
association in helping to explain to ordinary shareholders the need for
such a shares issue.''
At the time of the annual general meeting this summer relations
between the Scottish Pride board and the association were far from
cordial with five resolutions critical of the board submitted.
Mr Christie expressed the desire that an era of better understanding
could be established. ''We have every hope that our contribution will be
treated as constructively as intended,'' he said.
The association was open to all Scottish Pride shareholders who
supported retaining ownership and control of the company in the hands of
producers, he said. ''The company's assets were originally and willingly
funded by producers to act as a force for stability in the whole
industry.''
Mr Christie said most producers wanted dairy farmers to remain in
control.
''The great generosity which many have displayed in helping to defray
the legal costs resulting from our agm requisitions suggests that many
shareholders support our basic aims,'' he added.
A spokesman for Scottish Pride said the company welcomed constructive
communication with all shareholders.

George Russell (above left), former chairman and chief executive of
Euroscot Holdings which operated a major meat plant in Bathgate, has a
new role in promoting Scotland's seafood industry. He is chairman of the
Scottish Seafood Project, aimed at boosting the competitive performance
of the industry. The project will seek to counter the effects of strong
marketing by other seafood countries and will target the key markets of
Europe, including France, Germany and Spain as well as the UK. The
Scottish Enterprise Food Team, which is backing the project, estimates
that additional sales worth #65m could be generated, creating more than
200 jobs. On the right of the picture is the vice-chairman of the
project, Danny Couper, managing director of Couper's Seafoods.

PACKAGING
MACFARLANE (Clansman), the Scottish packaging group, has sold its
Macfarlane Interiors office furniture supply business to a management
buy-out group for an undisclosed sum.
The MBO, believed to be worth nearly #1m, was led by managing director
Jack Robertson, with the support of venture capital firm 3i, which has
taken a 22.5% equity stake, and loans and overdraft facilities from
Clydesdale Bank.
Macfarlane Interiors, which has been renamed Mico, sells high-quality
office furniture from showrooms in Glasgow and London.
The company, which has 18 staff, achieved annual sales of #4.5m and
what Mr Robertson describes as ''a six-figure profit''.
He expects to boost sales to between #4.7m and #4.8m in 1995.

BIOMEDICAL
SCOTTISH universities are looking for a larger slice of the billions
spent yearly on biomedical research around the world, writes KRISTY
DORSEY.
The Scottish Biomedical Research Trust, founded in May, is hoping to
attract an additional #50m in research funds to Scotland during the next
five years. The trust comprises staff from the research departments from
six of Scotland's leading universities.
Dr Stephen Hammond, its chief executive, said he believed the
single-door approach would attract investment from major research
companies in Japan and the US. ''That's where the big money is -- that's
where the big investment is,'' he said yesterday.
Trust chairman Dr Jim Stewart said it was essential to market Scottish
scientific achievements on a broad basis to take advantage of the
country's expertise and achievements. ''That is still a growth area --
one of the few left in the world,'' he said. ''We've got to take what we
have and capitalise on that. I really, fervently, believe that.''
Member univerisities are Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, St Andrews,
Strathclyde and Paisley. David Macauley, director of the Healthcare
Liasion Office, said the trust linked them into one top-class
organisation that could compete for funds at world level.
The trust is particularly looking for funds for research into
cardiovascular, inflammatory, respiratory and infectious diseases, as
well as cancer, diabetes, immunology, opthalmology, neurosciences and
bone disease.

<TEXT>
IT is no surprise that water stocks generally surged yesterday after
Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang gave the nod to France's Lyonnaise
des Eaux to make a formal bid for Northumbrian Water should it so
desire.
The clearance immediately raised the prospect in the market that water
companies could be a target for bids and mergers in much the same
fashion as the regional electricity companies. For the most part,
though, the critics believe the electricity companies have not, so far,
faced too searching an examination, whereas the proposed offer from
Lyonnaise did prompt a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission (MMC).
Ian Byatt, the director-general of Water Services, was anxious to
dispel any suggestion that we are likely to see a spate of takeovers in
the industry. He emphasised that any takeover of monopoly supplies of a
basic service such as water needs to be carefully considered by the
public authorities.
In deciding whether or not a merger is against the public interest the
MMC must consider the effect it would have on the director-general's
ability to make comparisons between different water companies. Mr Byatt
stated categorically that if a merger proceeded he would seek a remedy
to compensate for the loss of a comparator, normally through substantial
price reductions which would have the effect of pushing the newly-merged
company to the forefront of efficiency in the industry.
In the case of Northumbrian Water Group, the clearance is subject to a
number of conditions, including the imposition of price cuts of 15% over
the next six years if the merger goes ahead, a better deal than
originally suggested by the MMC. Lyonnaise has been waiting since March
for the verdict, and the terms seem far from onerous.
The two companies have agreed to meet but Northumbrian is still making
ritual noises about staying independent and Lyonnaise is also making
tactical noises about how tough the demands are. Northumbrian's share
price soared 66p to 1074p.
Lyonnaise could walk away but this is thought highly unlikely though a
hostile bid, contested by Northumbrian, could be on the cards. Unlike
the proposed takeover of the port of Dover, sentiment plays no part in
keeping out the French.
No end in sight
ALLIED Domecq chairman Michael Jackaman looked remarkably hale and
hearty on his 60th birthday yesterday but still felt it was not an
appropriate occasion to reveal the identity of his successor or even the
timing of the changeover. However, the general belief is that it will be
Sir Christopher Hogg of Courtaulds and Reuters.
Allied's confidence appears to be unsettled by the Domecq link. That
has seen a #995m acquisition reduced in value to just #241m thanks to
goodwill write-offs and currency depreciation.
The strategic emphasis is on cost-cutting, and Allied is paying the
price for not having taken decisions two or three years earlier. Its
Carlsberg-Tetley associate continues to be a far from satisfactory
operation and may remain so even after the closure of the Warrington
brewery in about a year. That will take a large chunk out of costs and
remove about 10% of group brewing capacity.
At present, the division is benefiting from selling beer to the Allied
licensed estate at prices about #100 a barrel above the industry
average. This leads to the conclusion, although it was denied yesterday,
that Carlsberg shareholders are benefiting more out of the arrangement
than Allied's -- the operating margin in the estate is 12% compared with
about 19% at both Bass and Whitbread.
Mr Jackaman refused to confirm that Goldman Sachs has been appointed
to seek a solution to the Carlsberg-Tetley situation where there are
three logical buyers. One is Carlsberg itself, which has pre-emptive
rights to over-bid anyone else. Another is Whitbread whose marketing
abilities could propel Britain's best selling Tetley bitter to new
heights. Guinness is the third potential buyer.
If it bought Carlsberg-Tetley, Guinness, a distilling oriented group,
would then have up to about 22% of the UK beer market depending on what
arrangements it made with Carlsberg.
While speculative turmoil will continue, Allied does have the benefit
of excellent international brands that will protect shareholder value.
However, the company needs a much more imaginative approach than is
currently provided.
Decision time
CRITICAL events which will determine the future shape of National
Power are fast approaching with the decision on a possible reference to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) of its Southern Electric bid
likely soon and the outcome of the sale of three power stations due in
the New Year.
National Power is optimistic about an MMC decision in the week
beginning November 20 and naturally hopes approval will be given. This
seems a reasonable assumption given the way the Government has let
through other bids in the sector, even disregarding advice from
regulators in doing so.
True, a bid for a regional electricity company (REC) from a power
generator is different from an American utility buying a REC but
ScottishPower had no trouble with its offer for Manweb.
The regulator, Stephen Littlechild, has submitted his views and
National Power says it stands ready to address any issues he has raised.
In particular it would pledge not to buy another REC.
The group can see no reason on competition grounds for a refusal and
the market seems to agree. Going by the movements in Southern's share
price it considers there is a one-third risk of a referral. Once
approval comes through National Power can move quickly to consummate the
deal as it has more than 50% acceptances plus market purchases.
The acquisition will push up National Power's gearing to 150% but that
is where the other deal cuts in. The sale of the power stations will
realise about #1000m and that of Southern's 11% National Grid stake will
bring in around #350m. So gearing will be quickly reduced to a
reasonable level.
Final bids for the power stations from the four companies interested
have to be in shortly and it is hoped to complete the sale by March.
The disposal was insisted upon by the regulator to increase
competition in generation. It will certainly succeed in this as it will
cut National Power's market share to between 20% and 25%.
These strategic moves will make the group a more integrated energy
business, taking in generation and distribution in the UK with interests
in various generating projects overseas. The latter have still to prove
their worth given the #214m invested in them. Potential returns are high
but are difficult to translate into actual profits.

THE feel-good factor is conspicuous by its prolonged absence from the
High Street despite the proximity of Christmas. No retailer has escaped
from the subsequent downturn in demand, Marks &amp; Spencer included.
As the market leader in clothing, its perceived ''outstanding value''
has traditionally allowed it to buck the market, but it too is feeling
the effects of consumer caution.
Profits in the six months to September 30 were 9% ahead at #385.4m, in
the middle of City expectations. Although clothing sales were difficult
in August and September, partly affected by the unseasonably warm
weather, food sales were good, rising 5.9%.
Fresh produce, meat, fish, sandwiches and soft drinks were popular.
Food price inflation was 3% with negligible inflation elsewhere in the
group.
Home furnishing sales increased 4.7%. There was another excellent
performance from financial activities with profits up a massive 45.1%,
although they are not expected to rise at the same rate in the second
half. There was continuing growth from financial services and a strong
contribution from the group's treasury operations.
The period also included the first results from the introduction of
new life assurance services. Take-up was lower than the company
expected, reflecting consumers' continued caution about the sector.
Although clothing and footwear sales were weaker than the comparable
period last year, up just 2.7%, M&amp;S held its market share and remains
confident about the attractiveness of its merchandise and prices.
Commenting on the results, chairman Sir Richard Greenbury said they
''represented an outstanding performance against a background of
consumer restraint and intense competition for disposable income''.
The outlook for the second half is mixed. Clothing sales are also said
to have been lower in October. However, Sir Richard is confident the
traditional strength of its food line at Christmas will ensure a
successful autumn trading period. The company will issue a Christmas
trading statement in January.
Overall, international sales advanced by 10% in the first half
although its eight Parisian shops had a tough time as shoppers were
scared away by the bomb attacks on the metro. Further international
expansion is to take place in the Far East.
The results, which were keenly awaited by the City after last week's
disappointing results from Boots and Sainsbury, were seen as
particularly good given a #9m higher pension contribution and a
continued poor performance from Brooks Brothers in the US because of
markdowns to shift stock. They boosted M&amp;S shares 4p to 411p. Retail
analysts are awaiting tomorrow's interim trading statement from rival
Burton Group.

INVESTMENT TRUST
SCOTTISH National Trust, one of the UK's largest split-capital
investment funds, enjoyed strong gains in its second half to
end-September, writes IAN McCONNELL.
Total assets, which showed only a marginal improvement at the halfway
stage, were up 12.8% at #412m by the year-end.
In terms of total return, the Gartmore Scotland-managed fund was well
ahead of the TOPSI-100 index but slightly adrift of the All-Share.
Trust chairman Sandy Struthers believes, on a short-term view, the
recently buoyant UK stockmarket looks to be fully discounting the
expected improvement in company profits.
However, he considers the rate of economic growth will remain above
its long-term average, and expects further improvement in profits to
benefit equity investments in terms of both capital and dividends in the
longer term.
The high yielding fund's strong second-half performance would have
been something of a relief to capital shareholders.
At the halfway stage, the net asset value of Scottish National's
non-dividend capital shares was down 26% at 31.8p. However, the net
asset value at end-September was 76.7p, up 79% over the 12 months.
After a final payout of 2.7p, Scottish National's total dividend on
income shares was up 2.7% at 7.7p. This was just covered by earnings of
7.81p.
This was the first increase in the full-year payout since it was
forced to cut its dividend three years ago.
Mr Struthers said the trust expected at least to maintain this higher
dividend next year.
In the 12 months to end-September, Scottish National's gross revenue
was up 3.8% at #22.7m.

BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION
BALFOUR Beatty, which claims the highest share of the general
contracting market in Scotland, has had its executive chairman poached
by rival group AMEC.
An official at Balfour Beatty's parent company, BICC, yesterday
admitted disappointment at the departure of Peter Mason.
BICC chief executive Alan Jones will assume the dual role of Balfour
Beatty chairman, with Mike Welton, 49, stepping up from joint managing
director to chief executive of Balfour Beatty when Mr Mason leaves at
the end of January.
Mr Mason, who earlier in his career worked for AMEC in Scotland,
joined Balfour Beatty as chief executive nearly four years ago. He
became executive chairman 18 months later.
Balfour Beatty puts its share of the Scottish general contracting
market at 6% and claims slightly more than 1% of the market south of the
Border. It accounts for nearly half of BICC's #3700m annual turnover
AMEC, which has been looking for a new chief executive for some
months, said Mr Mason, 49, would be expected to lead the group's
strategic development and ''help to secure profitable business in its
increasingly competitive international market-place''.
All of Britain's major building contractors have been struggling to
maintain margins in the past year, as workloads at home shrink and
competition increases.
Companies like AMEC and Balfour Beatty have been pursuing higher
value, project-based work, with a sizeable element of specialist
engineering or financial management.
Mr Welton, who has been with Balfour Beatty since 1978, has been
responsible for civil engineering, construction and building services
during the last 18 months.
The BICC official said: ''Peter Mason is a good guy and it is
disappointing to lose him but Mike Welton is an excellent successor, so
it is business as usual.''
BICC shares, having plunged to an intra-day low of 246p after the
news, eventually recovered to 255p, up 1p on the day. Shares in AMEC
were unchanged at 58p.
Balfour Beatty, which was founded in London in the early part of the
century, has had a strong presence in Scotland since it opened an office
north of the Border in 1910.
Recent commissions include the design and construction of the
second-stage expansion of the international facilities at Glasgow
Airport and the #4m redevelopment of Ibrox stadium for Rangers Football
Club.
AMEC has worked with Mr Mason, a main board director of BICC, on major
projects such as the extension of the London Underground's Jubilee line
between Green Park and Waterloo.
Balfour Beatty and AMEC are also partners in the new Hong Kong airport
project at Chek Lap Kok.

WEW and the Royal Bank of Scotland as issuer have both been somewhat
surprised by the success of the bargain store group's credit card which
should have some 30,000 holders by the year-end.
This is a valuable source of credit for those whose only other access
to secondary financing would be through credit checks, while also
bringing in much needed repeat business.
The Glasgow-based chain with some 82 outlets has been hard hit by the
general retail uncertainty with like-for-like sales plummeting
alarmingly. In the year to early August there was an overall decline of
9.4%, but in the fourth quarter that had accelerated to 16% and in the
last three months to 19%.
However, retiring executive chairman Peter Carr said yesterday that
the fall had eased to 9% in the last week with indications that
Christmas shopping has started.
Further ahead, there is the possibility of a loyalty card being
introduced.
Mr Carr, who was appointed to try to create some semblance of order
out of the remains of Amber Day, is being succeeded after the annual
meeting by James Millar, formerly of both Invergordon Distillers and Wm
Low. This raises the slightest of prospects that a bid could eventually
wend its way to WEW, although that will obviously be a long way in the
future. In the meantime, it means there is a heavyweight figure at the
top.
The National Lottery has hit hard but there has also been some loss of
purpose which is now being put right by the recruitment of Richard
Boland from Sears as chief executive and the appointment of new buying
directors.
There will be some effort to move the range slightly more upmarket
with an emphasis on value rather than cheapness. At any one time about
20% of the range will be a special offer with the concentration on
ladies' wear, which accounts for about 30% of the business.
Last year, group pre-tax profits rose a quarter to #4.06m on turnover
11% greater at #122m. Market expectations had been lowered by the
warning in June that there would be a second-half loss -- that emerged
at #1.78m.
Now with clear evidence that WEW has a coherent strategy both to
enhance its image in the High Street and also to invest in the business
through the introduction of proper stock control systems, the shares
advanced 3p to 17p. Profits during the year were hit by about #900,000
of stock clearances.
The dividend total has been held at 0.7p with a 0.35p final to put the
shares on a 5.1% yield.
Mr Carr was downbeat about immediate prospects so at this stage
maintained profit has to be the best assumption one can make for the
current year, initital benefits from new management possibly being
offset by no improvement in the High Street. But on a medium-term view
there are interesting speculative possibilities.

OIL AND GAS
BRITISH Petroleum's third-quarter performance is at the top end of
market projections, up 28% at #532m on a replacement cost basis which
strips out the effects of oil price changes, and ahead of exceptional
charges.
The shares, though, showed little reaction yesterday at 468p, which
compares with year's 'high' of 502p and a 'low' of 392p.
For the full nine months, replacement cost profits were 43% ahead. As
an initial step on the group's programme to rationalise its refining
network, BP has already announced the sale of its Marcus Hook refinery
in Pennsylvania, which has meant a #244m after-tax exceptional charge in
the third quarter to cover book value losses and potential environmental
liabilities.
Exploration and production operating profit for the quarter was up on
the same period of 1994 despite a slight fall in prices and and a
special charge in respect of Alaskan crude oil tankers. BP also
benefited from lower explration write-offs, reflecting the ''continuing
success'' of its exploration programme.
Rationalisation charges on European operations hit third-quarter
refining and marketing operations which were lower than a year ago
though improved over the second quarter. Lower refining margins were
offset by better refinery performance and throughput.
Chemicals improved over the nine months period with good margins and
steady volumes for most products as well as operating efficiencies.
However, third-quarter operating profits dipped to #225m compared with
#258m in the previous quarter with volumes reduced due to planned
maintenance shutdowns and by some weakening in demand.
Margins began to ease from the high levels of the first half of 1995
when there was considerable stock building as well as underlying
strength in consumption.

INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS' SURVEY
BUSINESS confidence has fallen to its lowest level since the pound was
forced to leave Europe's exchange rate mechanism in September 1992,
according to a survey published this morning by the Institute of
Directors.
For the first time in three years, the number of directors less
optimistic about future economic prospects has exceeded those who said
they were more optimistic.
The proportion of directors more optimistic about the economy remained
at the same level of 28% recorded in August. Those less confident
increased from 28% to 30%.
The institute said if there were any further signs of weakness in the
economy the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, should not
hesitate to cut interest rates.
Later this morning the Bank of England will publish its first
quarterly inflation report since the Governor, Eddie George, dropped his
demands for an increase in rates.
In its August report, the Bank was still arguing that the Government
would miss its target of reducing underlying inflation to 2.5% or less
by the end of the current Parliament in 1997.
But the Bank conceded that its projections showed that inflation would
fall below 2.5% later in 1997.
The slowdown in activity over the summer was a major factor in the
Bank's change of heart over rates. Today's report will be closely
studied to see if the Governor would put up a fight should the
Chancellor deem it necessary to cut rates.
Meanwhile, the institute said that political uncertainty, cited by 34%
of directors, was a significant factor in diminishing business
confidence.
The level of economic growth in the domestic economy was of concern to
33%, and tax and spendings levels were specified by 17% of directors.
Directors were more positive about their own businesses than the
general economic situation. However, company optimism slipped back to
51% from 58% in August. The decline was more pronounced in the south
where optimism had been stronger.
Yet a large a majority of 83% felt their companies were doing well or
fairly well, down only marginally from August's 84%.
There was evidence that the slowdown in activity was hitting business
volumes, profits, and output intentions. The proportion of directors
reporting an increased volume of business fell from 68% to 62%.
The number of directors reporting higher profits fell by 10 percentage
points to 52%. Only 44% of directors said they planned to increase
output in the next three months, down from 50% in August and 56% in
June.
Employment intentions were broadly stable with the proportion of
directors expecting to take on more staff falling just 1% to 44%.
Slightly more -- 23% against 21% in August -- planned to increase prices
within the next three months.
Ruth Lea, head of the institute's policy unit, said: ''These survey
results which come on top of Moday's figures showing a 0.6% decline in
manufacturing output will make uneasy reading for the Chancellor in the
run-up to the Budget.''
Business was clearly concerned about the economic slowdown which had
hit Government finances and which would reduce the Chancellor's scope
for cutting taxes, she added. The deterioration should be seen in the
context of a business sector which was continuing to perform well.
''The Chancellor should make bold spending cuts to finance the tax
cuts business needs, and, if there are further signs of weakening in the
economy, he should not hesitate to cut interest rates,'' she said.

CURRENCIES
FRENCH financial markets were initially thrown into turmoil yesterday
when the Elysee Palace announced that Alain Juppe's unpopular Government
had resigned, writes R E DUNDAS.
But the panic did not last long, as it emerged that Mr Juppe would
stay on as Prime Minister and the administration would be slimmed down
and reconstructed the better able to carry out the austerity programme
needed to get France back on course for European monetary union by 1999.
The franc rebounded and on the Paris bourse bonds and equities took
heart from the political developments. France is currently running a
public sector deficit equal to 5% of gross domestic product. It must get
this down to 3% under the Maastricht Treaty's guidelines for monetary
union.
Playing musical chairs is an easy game compared with the agonising
decisions which lie ahead. Consider what cutting Government borrowing
has done to the political standing of John Major's Government.
France has already paid a high price in terms of high unemployment for
its ''franc fort'' policy.

IT IS a mild day yet Patricia Fraser is wearing a long mink coat. She
needs it, she needs to wear it insouciantly and to talk about its hefty
value, to remind herself and others that she, once a working-class girl
from the Welsh valleys, made good by marrying James Fraser, younger
brother of Malcolm, Laird of Reelig. For that high life has disappeared.
Patricia, 40, is now divorced and no longer has money or status or the
power and self-importance they bring. Additionally, she feels stripped
of her identity, rejected by the upper class yet unable to return to her
former existence.
She lets herself into a house owned by friends, where she is staying
temporarily, deposits the mink on the bannister and, a victim of
childhood polio, limps into the lounge.
The eye is drawn to the mantelpiece and a pair of elegant bronze
horses, the only antiques to remain in her possession. They look
incongruous, standing over a gas fire in the bare front room of a
terraced house situated in the ''rough end'' of Evesham, near
Birmingham. ''If I'd married a builder's labourer I'd have ended up with
more,'' says Patricia miserably. ''Now I'm back to where I started.''
She grew up in the Welsh mining village of Oakdale, where her father
was a cinema manager and lived with her parents, brother, sister and
grandparents in a rented cottage next to a pub. The family washed in a
tin tub in front of the fire, managed without a car and only ever
possessed a black and white television set. The children's clothes were
second-hand or made by Patricia's grandmother. The miners' children, she
says, were better off.
Yet it was a happy childhood. She rode Welsh mountain ponies belonging
to a neighbouring farmer, worked in Woolworths on a Saturday and never
minded that she spent much of her life in hospital undergoing operations
that attempted to correct her limp.
Consequently, she left school with no qualifications and at 17 married
a local boy, a bus driver.
One day Patricia paid a visit to her parents-in-law and found them
sitting on either side of the fireplace. That will be us in 40 years'
time, she thought with horror, sitting in unless we've scraped enough
money for a night out at bingo and looking old before our time. One day,
she promised herself, she would leave that enforced life of poverty.
When her marriage broke up six years later Patricia seized her chance.
She answered an advert for a nanny and left the Welsh valleys to look
after the four children of an Arab princess in Saudi Arabia, allowing
her a first taste of vast wealth.
Eighteen months later she took a new job, this time in Monte Carlo,
caring for a retired MP. It was there, in 1980, when Patricia was 25,
that she met James Fraser.
''I was helping out one night at a local drama group and this very
tall man 6'3", walked into the room. Everybody turned and looked at him.
He was stunningly handsome,'' she remembers. ''And the way he spoke was
gorgeous. Like Prince Charles. Ultra posh.''
A week later, after they had met on just four occasions, he arrived at
her employer's house, went down on bended knee and proposed.
''There I was, in a beautiful villa overlooking the Mediterranean with
James asking me to marry him and producing from his pocket an enormous
antique diamond and sapphire ring. I was bowled over. I never stopped to
think, why me? I mean, I wasn't young, I wasn't glamorous, I wasn't a
pop singer. Perhaps he just wanted a wife, any wife -- he was 48 and
maybe people were talking. Maybe he'd believed the rumour going round
that I'd just divorced a rich Arab.
''But everything was so sudden and it was like a dream. I wasn't
thinking clearly at all.''
Flinging herself into the fairy-tale, Patricia accepted, and from that
moment entered the grand charmed existence of high society.
''Until then the only place I could ever afford to go for clothes was
C&amp;A and there I was in Christian Dior, buying whatever I wanted,'' she
laughs. ''Once I paid #350 for a nightdress, a very ordinary nightdress.
I just did it because I could.''
James's family may have disapproved of his choice of bride, but the
couple were married at Inverness Cathedral three months later with a
reception for 200 at the family's seat, once frequented by George VI.
The only member of Patricia's family present was her mother, a decision
she says that was taken by James and his mother, as was the choice of
wedding gown from Harrods.
Although hurt, Mrs Fraser, now related by marriage to the Duke of
Athol and to a former lady-in-waiting to the Queen Mother, quickly
settled into being the wife of a wealthy member of the aristocracy.
The couple lived in Monte Carlo, then in London, staying at the
Mayfair Hotel for six months while James's flat was being redecorated.
Later they moved to Wiltshire, to a beautiful Georgian house, then spent
six years in Andorra, where Patricia was attended by a maid who would
lay out her very expensive clothes every morning.
She travelled in style, often in chauffeur-driven limousines, received
personal and fawning attention in shops, and was invited to garden
parties and charity dos; she even met Princess Margaret.
Holidays were taken in rather more exotic destinations than her
childhood visits to Blackpool.
''We would spend Christmas at Claridges. That's my favourite hotel,''
she says, forgetting that these days she cannot afford even to take tea
there.
It seems Patricia adapted surprisingly easily to her new status, or
rather to the wealth. ''It does come naturally,'' she says. ''Soon you
get used to having money. And you expect it. But I felt on edge whenever
I was with his family. I was scared to speak in case I said the wrong
thing. It was the same with his friends.''
Although she tried to avoid embarrassing her husband, Patricia
declined his offer of elocution lessons, and occasionally found herself
speaking out of turn.
''We once gave a dinner party in Scotland and his friends really
pissed me off. They were talking about the unemployed, calling them
'those people' and lay-abouts. I said, 'you can't generalise like that.
What do you think, that you get hundreds of pounds on the dole?' They
really had no idea. They lived in a dream world, protected by their
money and who they are and patronising about everyone who was beneath
them.''
Her own family, now living in a council house in Wiltshire, certainly
was, but Patricia stayed in touch with her siblings and widowed mother.
And while she may have rejected cold nights by the fire in the Welsh
valleys she kept the memory of her roots alive by regular sessions at
the nearest bingo hall.
''Much to James's disapproval,'' she grins. ''My cleaning lady and
gardener would keep a table for me.''
However, although Patricia loved her husband, the social gulf between
them was impossible to bridge. Long distanced from her own friends yet
unable to enter James's circle, Patricia's loneliness and her husband's
unwillingness to have children, led her to seek a divorce three years
ago.
Her life of luxury came to an abrupt end. With no money of her own,
and unable to survive on the #45 a week from social security, Patricia
sold the few items in her possession, including her engagement ring.
When the divorce was finalised this year, she accepted a #3000
settlement.
''I had debts to pay,'' she explains. ''I'd been led to believe I'd
get a bigger settlement, so I'd set about buying a house and had bills
from a surveyor and builder. I was also behind with the payments on my
car which had been bought on HP while I was still married.''
Patricia, now working for a nursing agency, is planning to write a
book, a kiss-and-tell account of her life with James, which she says
held some unsavoury secrets, and is looking for a publisher. She hopes
it will bring financial gain for it is proving too difficult to adapt to
being once more just a working-class girl from the Welsh Valleys.
It may be difficult to feel sympathy for Patricia Fraser. After all
she led a spoilt existence for 15 years. Yet she cuts a sorry figure,
the victim of marital breakdown, class difference and financial
acclimatisation, desperately clinging on to the last vestiges of a life
that was prosperous and pretentious.
''Not long ago I was with some friends and I refused to go into a fish
and chip shop. I'm used to all the best places. I just can't adapt to
having McDonald's. I'm afraid I can't,'' she says, her voice rising in
panic.
''I've been ostracised by James's family, but I can't go back to being
how I was. I don't feel I belong anywhere now.
''Once I paid #350 for a very ordinary nightdress. I just did it
because I could.''

THE Scottish limb of the Royal Orchestral Exchange, which will see the
Royal SNO this week touring to Liverpool, Birmingham and London, gets
under way tonight with an opening concert at Liverpool's Philharmonic
Hall, where the RSNO will be under the direction of principal conductor
Walter Weller, with the amazing Russian pianist Grigory Sokolov as
soloist in Brahms's First Piano Concerto.
The Royal Orchestral Exchange -- a complex structure in which each of
Britain's three Royal orchestras: the Royal Philharmonic from London,
the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, and the Royal SNO, will play at each
other's home bases -- had a curious origin. It began in two places at
once.
In Glasgow, RSNO chief executive Paul Hughes was entertaining his
opposite number from the Royal Philharmonic in a West End eaterie, when
the rather fanciful idea of some sort of exchange between the two
orchestras was mooted.
Meanwhile in Liverpool, the boss of the RLPO was approached by
executives of the Royal Insurance, whose head offices are in that city.
The insurance company was investigating ways of celebrating its 150th
anniversary this year, and was keen to be associated with a cultural
project involving the RLPO.
Back in Glasgow, the notion of extending an exchange project to the
country's third Royal orchestra seemed the logical next step, so the
Scottish and London orchestra executives then approached their colleague
in Liverpool. By all accounts, the reaction from Liverpool was: ''Well,
funnily enough . . .''
Enter the Royal Insurance, which bought up the project lock, stock,
and barrel. And an extremely complicated schedule was then worked out to
allow each orchestra to visit the other's territory. (The Liverpool
orchestra is in Glasgow next Thursday with its chief conductor, Libor
Pesek, and the Royal Philharmonic, with the wee Russian dazzler, Yuri
Temirkanov, arrives in the middle of next month.)
It gets even more complex, because, at some stage, Birmingham also
entered the picture. And nobody seems sure why. Anyway, each orchestra,
while on their ''Royal'' tour, will also play Birmingham's wonderful
Symphony Hall.
The global figure for the Royal Insurance's sponsorship is #185,000,
which will cover the costs of transporting three big orchestras around
the country, along with accommodation, marketing, and promotion costs.
In terms of repertoire, it was decided to have a unifying theme. Each
orchestra would feature a Dvorak symphony. The Royal SNO will play
number five, the Royal Liverpool Phil number six, and the Royal
Philharmonic number eight.
Specifically to coincide with the 150th birthday of the insurance
company, it was also decided to feature a set of works composed in 1845.
For the Royal SNO, with its own winter season schedule continuing
regardless, it means a hectic 10 days. Between tonight and Friday they
will play Liverpool, Birmingham and London. Then with the same programme
and artists, next week they will fulfil winter season commitments in
Aberdeen, Inverness, and Edinburgh, before slotting in their final Royal
Orchestral Exchange concert in Glasgow a week on Saturday. Band on the
run, indeed.

CLIFFORD ODETS holds a special place in many British left-wing hearts.
After all, in the mid-30s, his Waiting For Lefty, was the banner-waving
play for a whole generation of socialists hopeful of a better world.
Fifteen years later The Country Girl, however, looked forward in a
different way -- to do more with personal than collective change.
One of a long line of plays about backstage theatrical life, it
contains one of the most startlingly honest portrayals of booze, its
deceits and dependencies, and an exploration of a triangular tug-of-war
that has the potential to be heart-rending.
One can only imagine how the 1952 British premiere must have gone with
Michael Redgrave as the dypso-ed great actor, Frank Elgin, Googie
Withers as his long-suffering wife, Georgie, and Sam Wanamaker as Bernie
Dodd, the young Italian-American director blinded by ambition and his
conviction that he can wring one last great performance from the fallen
idol.
Annie Castledine's production with Corin Redgrave in his father's
shoes and Kika Markham as Georgie, however, barely hints at what might
have been. Woefully under-energised and at a speed that only reinforces
Odets's odd, faltering rhythms -- both pre-dating today's naturalism
forms yet still harbouring the dying embers of a starchier, more
sentimental time -- the whole affair staggers, on Simon Banham's
cumbersome drawbridge set, to an unconvincing conclusion.
A play certainly of great humanity, you can see why Castledine would
have warmed to the play -- particularly one that set out to rehabilitate
the abused Georgie. But in a production that lacks any consistent sense
of emotional focus or rigour (save Redgrave and Daniel Stewart's odd
moments of tension) -- this one does Odets no favours.

ONLY Steven Berkoff could make Herod a hero. The butcher of babies and
an incestuous tyrant is portrayed as a delightful and malevolent madman.
In truth, his majesty is a maniac who wears a cartoon crown.
As he struts the stage like the royal peacocks he offers Salome in
place of the baptist's head, he can transform from a raging Yosemite Sam
to a petulant cockney child in a blink.
You are reminded of the cult of the serial killer. Berkoff is Hannibal
Lector, imagined by Oscar Wilde.
However, it is sex rather than death which is the glue that sticks
this play to the forefront of your mind.
There are images of the exotic; a girl so desirable a king could lose
his soul; the dance of the seven veils as a strip-tease mime, side-long
glances which will chill the soul yet torch the veins.
Wilde's script is a carousel throwing out jewel-like scenes which
Berkoff buffs, shines, then at times discards, in favour of his own
demented brilliance.
The story of Salome's illicit request was once banned for blasphemy in
Britain, yet today it stands almost as a morality tale against the
darkness of desire.
''You will do this thing for me'' is the line Zigi Ellison as Salome
chants, in effect, to her death. While the actors move like mannequins
in a deathly dance, Salome is a bad thought on castors, stirred on to
her doom by a piano, the notes from which are priceless.
A trilogy of superb performances is completed by Jolyon Baker as John
the Baptist, a man convincing enough to start his own cult. But Berkoff
remains the man who would be king.
If Wilde was a man to indulge his purple prose style, it would be
Berkoff who would bathe in it, and emerge, still smelling of roses.

Music
WELL, they got away with it. Just. I suspect that, in a bigger venue
with a more spacious acoustic, the technical flaws that peppered the
performance yesterday of Dvorak's great A major Piano Quintet, in which
the Edinburgh Quartet was joined by pianist Murray McLachlan, would have
stood out glaringly.
As with the last few times I have heard the quartet, the problem was
one of intonation. It's not that it's off, though it does slip off
centre. There is generally a feeling of instability of intonation,
within the ensemble and right across the group, as though it's never
quite dead centre, never fully focused, and thus never entirely stable.
The effect is edgy and uncomfortable, and unquestionably undermines
the structure and flow of the music to hand. By and large, in Dvorak's
ebullient and sunny Quintet, the general effect, especially in the many
racing, bustling pages, communicated itself with colour, brilliance and
immediacy in the confined quarters of Hutchesons Hall.
But when the strings were on their own -- especially in the opening
section of the third movement Scherzo -- a distinct feeling of
scrappiness, with a sense that the group's intention wasn't well-defined
in the planning, showed right through the texture.
It's not my place to offer advice to performing groups, especially not
one as experienced and -- in its day -- distinguished as the Edinburgh
Quartet. But whenever I have heard them in recent years, it does seem as
though something crucial in the fabric has slipped.
String quartets are still thin on the Scottish scene -- though the
brilliant Yggdrasil Quartet of Aberdeen has swept all before it. The
Edinburgh Quartet still has a role to play, but I would suggest that
they must get themselves on tape, and listen honestly and critically to
the results.

I KNOW there have already been two claims on these pages for the first
panto of the season, but if the jury is still out I'd like to submit a
last-minute nomination for Barnum.
After all, with clowns in the foyer, songs for every occasion and many
for no occasion at all, a plot that never gets its hands dirty even when
it deals with infidelity, death and politics, and even the same director
-- David Kelsey -- as the King's forthcoming Cinderella, it would only
take a man in drag and a couple of song-sheets for it to be
indistinguishable from the genuine article.
Except that I hope to enjoy the genuine article rather more. It's not
that there's anything terribly wrong with this production, it's just
that a show about as spectacular a character as the 19th-century circus
impresario P T Barnum cannot get away with being average. It has to
excel if it is to make any impression at all.
So we might admire Andrew O'Connor's pluck for carrying such a
demanding central role, but as long as his charisma is more like that of
a lippy bank clerk than an extravagant showman, we are simply not
convinced.
If the plot were not geared up for minimum exposition, maximum music,
it might have given him the personality clues to fall back on, but as it
is, he's like the shell of a character eagerly but meaninglessly going
through the motions.
It's the same with the stunts -- and the show's full of them -- which
are competent but not dazzling, and for all the ringmaster's talk of
flannel and humbug, this production is more bunkum than Barnum.

JIM Cartwright's impressionistic account of the motley characters
living along a road in a small Lancashire town is a brutal distillation
of the times -- sharply observed sketches, redolent with subtle
symbolism, of those whose lives have been impoverished in so many ways
by the economic and spiritual ravages of unemployment.
Cartwright gives urgent voice to the dispossessed who whisper, yell,
laugh, and cry out their disappointments, which are many. These are
people surrounded by poverty and pain who have to look hard for their
pleasures, mostly searching at the bottom of a bottle, but as often as
not finding them in harmless memories of the past or panic-flecked hopes
for the future.
Cartwright draws deep on the traditions of oral history in these
remembrances, a tradition at once acknowledged and gently mocked through
the character of the Professor, the cloth capped amateur anthropologist
who pathetically clutches his tape recorder and seeks a sense of
identity through capturing the voices of others.
Despite an abundance of coarse wit it's a bleak play and perhaps the
most affecting aspect is that it seems as timely now as it did in 1986
in this updated production by the final year students.
Director Ian Wooldridge handles Cartwright's visceral, edgy dialogue
with great consideration, drawing measured performances from his
nine-strong cast who handle over two dozen roles with relish and a
commendable command of the Lancashire tongue.
A few miserable tables and chairs dot a stark stage, with an
incongruous silver strand curtain as a backdrop. Behind that tawdry,
shimmering screen is a massive television monitor, its flickering images
the opium of people depressed beyond endurance.

Brussels
LABOUR MEPs will be asked to make full disclosure of their earnings
from consultants and lobbyists and to implement fully Lord Nolan's
recommendations.
They might go further than their Westminster colleagues by putting
politically-related earnings on the Internet, it emerged last night.
A check yesterday of Euro-MPs' register of interests showed that only
one of the eight Scottish members has not disclosed fees paid for
consultancy work.
Mr Ken Collins (Labour, Strathclyde East) has disclosed that he a
''European adviser'' for a consultancy called European Public Policy
Advisers. However, he gives no details of the fee paid.
Under existing rules, MEPs must fill in a form listing their
professional activities and must their paid activities but not
necessarily their fees.
Mr Collins said last night he supported disclosure and would wait for
the European Parliament's decision on the matter in December when two
reports on proposed new rules for lobbyists' and the receipt of
consultancy fees by Euro-MPs will be discussed.
He said his work for European Public Policy Advisers involved meeting
from time to time the head of the consultancy, Mr Jeremy Kane, ''to
discuss community high politics, if you like''.
Asked how much he was paid, he replied: ''Put it this way -- much less
than #5000 by quite a bit.''
He said he wanted to make clear his work at no time involved tabling
questions or amendments or writing letters on behalf of anyone. ''This
was agreed,'' Mr Collins said, adding that he thought the register of
MEPs' interests should be made available in the member states and not
just Brussels, Strasbourg, and Luxembourg.
Meanwhile, Labour's Mr John Tomlinson (Birmingham West) said the
party's 63 MEPs should put disclosure of their extra earnings on the
Internet. He said: ''I don't think there will be any dissent from
that.''

NOW that the mystery surrounding the authorship of Goodnight Girl is
over, another sweet little mystery has come to light with the
publication of Brian Beacom's book on the soggy Clydebank popsters,
titled A Sweet Little Mystery.
The Wets' have their very own own book but there's no chapter on their
experiences with plagiarism.
Page 73 of Brian's book points out two instances of m'learned friends'
involvement when Van Morrison took a bit of umbrage at their lifting
bits of his song, Sense of Wonder, and on Angel Eyes the Wets sang:
''The saddest thing I've ever seen on my TV screen was a dying man who
died for his team, the toughest thing I ever heard was that newborn
scream in this wicked world.''
This bears more than a passing resemblance to the previously published
Squeeze song, Heartbreaking World, which contains: ''The saddest thing
I've ever seen was a football fan dying for his team; the greatest sound
I've ever heard was a baby cry in this wicked world.''
Money changed hands on both occasions, but the band laughed it off as
''paying homage''. See Brian Beacom? See homage? This book isn't.
Withering heights
NO mystery about the headline from The Kathmandu Post of October 22,
which bills itself as Nepal's National Newspaper and has on its front
page ''Missing ladder deters Indian team from conquering Everest''. What
the diary finds mysterious is that Catherine Dobbie, our informant, sent
the newspaper from Campbeltown.
Refreshers
THE traditional way of life in the Western Isles has at last been
recognised by the powers that be in Stornoway and its young people are
being prepared to follow in the occasionally uncertain footsteps of
their forefathers and mothers by the introduction of a Scotvec module at
Lews Castle College (or Colaisde a' Chaisteil, if you prefer the
Gaelic).
The course starts this month and is titled Introduction to Alcoholic
Beverages. Just to make sure they don't enjoy it too much, it commences
on Thursday mornings at 9am and continues until 1.15pm. There is no
mention of the course being continued in the afternoon.
Like a kipper
THE high-pitched whine you hear is the late Lord Fraser birling in his
Kilmarnock lair. A reader from Busby received an invitation from General
Manager Richard Hopkins of the House of Fraser in Glasgow to join them
for a meal.
A very nice gesture, she thought, until on reading further she
realised she had been invited to a complimentary English Breakfast
(Fraser's capitals).
No Mr Dopey
CULLED from the pages of the magazine Police is the true tale of PC
Terry Swales, who charged a suspect with possession of cannabis in
contravention of the Misuse of Drugs Act. The arrested one indignantly
replied: ''I wasn't misusing them. I was smoking them.''
The trying game
THE Diary is the proud owner of a Murrayfield debenture entitling us,
for the meagre sum of #1200, the magnificent privilege of buying one
ticket for every home game. Tickets for the England and France games are
now #23, up #1 from last year and nearly doubled from pre-debenture
days. The price for the somewhat meaningless and much-devalued game
against Western Samoa next week is #18.
According to Suave Gav, the SRU may have something to learn about
professionalism, but don't seem to need much education in red of tooth
and claw capitalism. There is a tiny marketing irony. On the reverse of
the ticket is a silver security film with holograms, to deter forgers.
One of these images, complete with eye-patch and parrot, is of a pirate.
Takes all sorts
AMONG the articles recently advertised for sale in The Buteman by
Robert Ainslie &amp; Sons, Auctioneers, of Rothesay, were a red plastic
basin, a peddle (sic) bin, a coat-hanger, golf sticks, and wine bottles.
No, not bottles of wine, wine bottles. And what is a golf stick?
On the front page of the same issue is a picture of a very pleasant
wedding couple. Part of the caption reads: ''The page boy was the
bride's sister Iain Simpson.'' Our thanks to Mike Blair of Bute and
Cowal Tourist Board.
Re-recycling
THIS story, involving a penurious family on Bute, was related by a
retired police superintendent. Back in the days when toilet paper was
shiny, marked Izal, and no-one in our immediate social circle could
afford it, a wee laddie turned up at the local chemist shop with an
envelope with the exact cost of a roll of Izal in it and a note asking
them to wrap it securely.
On the Monday he was back with the parcel untouched and another note,
this one asking for a refund as: ''The visitors didn't come.''
Jobs for the girls
AN advertisment in the jobs section of the British Medical Journal
requests a VSO volunteer for three to six months. ''A doctor with
experience of sexually-transmitted diseases is urgently required to work
at Tuol Kok Dike Clinic in the red light district of Phnom Pehn. The
volunteer must be a woman.'' Naturally, but what about the Toul Kok
section?
What's in a name?
THOSE of you in possession of some of that new-fangled computer
technology will no doubt be fully familiar with the Spellcheck facility
available on Microsoft software, which appears to have developed a taste
for human gossip. How else could we explain that as an alternative to
'Duncan Ferguson' it suggested 'Dunce Freemason'?

BLONDES have more fun, so the saying goes. I've spent a large part of
my life trying to disprove it, practising a ''let's hear it for the
brunettes'' kind of hedonism. But now I have to admit defeat.
After trying it out for myself I have to acknowledge that blondes
certainly get more attention. Now, damn it, I suspect the fairer of the
fairer sex really are the fairest and all that stands between me and a
lifetime of glamour with legions of adoring menfolk is a bottle of
bleach.
Enlightenment dawned last weekend when I donned a long platinum wig
for a fancy dress party held by myself and the Boy Reporter. It was a
post-Hallowe'en, pre-Guy Fawkes fireworks extravaganza and guests had
been warned that not only was fancy dress obligatory it had to be OTT.
We knew they would get into the spirit of things. Our friends are very
competitive people.
Plans and strategies had been carefully discussed for months
beforehand with the Boy. He had generously agreed to provide the venue
-- his palatial residence -- for what we were determined would be the
most magnificent extravaganza ever to be seen in Glasgow.
He provided the flat and I provided the fizz. I reckoned he was the
producer of the party, taking care of the organisational side of things,
and I was the director, providing the creative spark. I don't think he
saw it that way. Well, the Boy has artistic aspirations.
This co-hosting thing seemed like the perfect way to throw a party --
all of the fun and none of the slog. Or so I imagined until I showed up
on the morning of the bash, was faced with what looked like a building
site instead of a party room, and was handed a mop.
The Boy promptly took to the phone to engage in so-called ''urgent''
conversations which seemed to involve lots of flirty giggling. The Boy
had not only taken pains to point out to everyone that our joint
invitations were no indication of coupledom, he was also going to great
lengths to ensure he invited every young, single woman in town.
And they all showed up. ''Wow! Major babefest!'' gasped all my male
mates, while my female friends spent most of the party desperately
seeking spare men. But the only guys to be found were the stuffed ones
tended by kids at the corners of streets.
Even male characters -- such as Dracula and a particularly dashing
naval officer -- were actually gorgeous, pouting girls. The Boy had
certainly pulled it off.
The only sizable group of men was a crowd of chaps dressed up as
Scouser numpties from the Harry Enfield sketch. Their shell suits, fuzzy
black wigs and droopy moustaches weren't particularly attractive.
Neither was the fact that they stayed in character for the duration of
the evening, responding ''aye, aye'' in high-pitched voices while
bobbing their heads to any query.
It was impossible to engage them in conversation, never mind chat them
up.
The Scousers had come in a group but there were a few accidental
doubles. My pre-party attempts to be casting director to ensure
everyone's costume was unique had floundered in the face of the kind of
secrecy you would normally associate with Cold War espionage.
Subsequently, there were more Charleston girls than you could shake a
cigarette holder at.
Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction were a big influence. Two Uma Thurmans
walked through the door one after the other, causing everyone to do a
double take. Alison K had the edge on the accessory front, with a deadly
looking revolver and a packet of cocaine -- she assured us it was talcum
powder -- pinned to her lapel.
There was also a quintet of Catwomen. Alison M looking slinkily feline
in a tight PVC suit and Alison B -- for some reason, most of the women
at this party were called Alison -- purring and cracking a whip.
The Batman theme was continued with the Boy's costume. He was garishly
and splendidly togged up as the Joker, with stunning face make-up
courtesy of yours truly. It was a potentially irritating get-up as he
had a pocketful of tricks to annoy us with.
A doctor was on hand, the Boy's brother, but he was a fake so we made
sure the Statue of Liberty, a trained physic, was standing by when the
fireworks were set off.
As the Snow Queen I abdicated all responsibility. ''I'm not going near
them, I'm highly flammable!'' I shrieked from a safe distance, all
flouncy nylon net and acrylic wig. ''And will you bloody Scousers stop
chucking sparklers at me!''
Despite the flying sparklers the display went off safely, although the
Statue of Liberty's services were required later in the evening when
Pocahontas sat on a broken bottle, lacerated her ligament. Her brother
visited the next day to assure the Boy she had had a brilliant time. The
party was that good.
THERE was a moment of mild panic when Kelly showed up with a bunny
girl costume and the kind of cleavage Elizabeth Bennett would have
killed for. Her arrival triggered an eerie calm: conversation ceased
while tongues lolled out.
I wasn't creating that kind of sensation but my new look was causing a
stir. Every time I tried to take my wig off some guy persuaded me to
stick it back on again. It troubled me somewhat that a ghastly #6.50
mess of acrylic tresses seemed so preferrable to my own conditioned
brown locks.
The wig was hot, causing sweat to pour down my face making my
pantomine make-up run (the Boy's lower face make-up had also
mysteriously disappeared after a sortie with a female Noel Coward).
''Leave it on, you look good,'' I was told. ''I don't want to look
good,'' I snapped back. ''I'm supposed to look evil.'' I was getting
paranoid that I looked like the fairy from the Christmas tree.
I slunk off in the early hours while the festivities were still going
strong, selfishly leaving the Boy the task of clearing it all up. He
could dig out the Mr Muscle. I was off to look for that bottle of
bleach.

GUITARIST Eric Clapton received an OBE from the Prince of Wales at
Buckingham Palace yesterday and confessed he was at last ''mellowing out
with age''.
The reformed alcoholic, who has admitted he conquered drug addiction
and has had a long series of women in his life, was dressed as soberly
as anyone at the ceremony.
Wearing a smart grey suit and neatly knotted dark blue spotted tie, he
bowed to the prince before receiving the award, announced in the New
Year Honours list.
As the 50-year-old took his seat after the ceremony among nearly 150
other recipients and hundreds of guests, he said he regarded his OBE as
''a very, very great honour''.
Would he have accepted such an honour a few years ago? ''Maybe not,''
he said. ''I think I may be mellowing out with age. Now I know it's a
wonderful thing and I'm very, very proud of it -- even more so when I
think where I have been and where I have come from.
''I have met the prince before and today he said he was very glad I
had got it. I was excited, I have to admit, and I'm pleased to be
here.''
The man hailed as the rock's greatest guitarist played before the
Prince and Princess of Wales at the Royal Albert Hall 12 years ago in a
fund-raising concert.
Yesterday, when he entered the Great Ballroom where the investiture
was held, he looked with obvious interest at the musicians of the Band
of the Grenadier Guards, up in the music gallery, who were playing a
selection from My Fair Lady.
The nearest the band's programme got to the blues loved by Clapton was
Leroy Anderson's light music classic from a world before rock'n'roll,
Blue Tango. Clapton was to have attended an investiture earlier this
year but the ceremony was delayed as he was out of the country on tours.
He said he had decided to go to the palace alone rather than take the
permitted three guests. ''I decided it would be easier to come on my own
rather than find someone who would enjoy it as much as I did.''
Asked about his plans, he said: ''I'm resting at the moment but not
for long.''
Also receiving an OBE from the prince was actress Susan Hampshire, who
got the award for services to dyslexic people.
Miss Hampshire, who is president of the Dyslexia Institute, is a
long-standing campaigner for wider recognition of the condition, which
hampers many children's reading and spelling.
Hours after being presented with the OBE, Clapton received a top music
award -- the Q Magazine merit award -- from Oscar-winning actress and
singer Cher at a celebrity lunch at the Park Lane Hotel in London's
Mayfair.

THE point of Alice M Morrison's letter (November 4) is lost on me, I'm
afraid. I found the article by Sally Magnusson warm, evocative, and
highly amusing. I'm sure she wasn't seeking sympathy at all, and I bet
the children had just as good a time in the caravan, as they would if
they had been kept at home.
I have been there -- well, not in deepest Argyll, but in a caravan,
all the same, in St Andrews. I had an eye infection, our eldest daughter
had whooping cough, our twin babies had chest infections (on
antibiotics!) and our other wee fellow sustained a sprained ankle within
minutes of arriving at our destination. It poured for a week.
Parents like us, with five children (now!), reckless though we appear
to be, do believe in ''getting on'' with it. Our philosophy, shared
obviously by Sally Magnusson and her husband, is to ignore Sod's Law.
And everyone who has children will know that Sod's Law generally strikes
at the beginning of school holidays, or after one has made elaborate
arrangements to enjoy an evening out, as a couple.
To search the article, as Alice Morrison obviously has, for a deeper
meaning is, in my opinion, a waste of time.
So what if the purpose of writing is to contribute to the family
income? I've done that for years, when and where I can, to relieve the
financial pressure from my husband.
So I suppose I've had my cake -- and eaten it too. The only difference
is that along with Sally Magnusson and countless other women who ''enjoy
life'', we bake the cakes ourselves''
Sally Magnusson should keep on cushioning her standard of living, and
long may she continue to contribute to a first-class newspaper.

LIKE Alice C Morrison I would consider myself to be broadly feminist,
because I feel that women should have more recognition for what they do.
However, her letter (November 4) upset me. I'm sure it also upset Sally
Magnusson, and many other women like her.
Why not just keep shovelling the guilt, until we disappear under it?
Yes, we mothers do feel guilty. It seems to come part and parcel with
motherhood as we try to juggle our family duties with our own needs. How
often are fathers made to feel guilty as they try to combine work with a
family?
If Alice Morrison is a mother, then surely she would remember that if
you put off going out simply because one of the children has a cough or
a sniffle, the first five years of your children's lives would be spent
entirely in the house! Furthermore, Sally Magnusson would be aware that
to cancel the holiday would have brought on displays as spectacular as
those seen on November 5.
I thoroughly enjoyed her article (and a previous one a few weeks ago).
I enjoyed her ability to make us see the humorous side of motherhood,
but also respect her for the honesty with which she writes.
Alice Morrison asked who were to feel sorry for. She is the one I feel
sorry for. How could she write such a mean letter in the name of
feminism?

BRIAN Wilson uses the Quebec referendum result for another attack on
Scottish independence (November 3).
Despite what he says, there has not been a great deal of welding
together during the two centuries since the French were defeated at
Quebec. Even today there is some justification for the view that the
French and British Canadians regard each other as foreigners, not
fellow-countrymen.
A whiff of this antipathy runs through Mr Wilson's article. There is
no charity shown to the majority of French speakers who have seen their
aspirations shattered -- only a stern lecture on their errors.
It is not that Mr Wilson himself has been steadfast in his political
leanings. Not so long ago he was bitterly opposed to the setting-up of a
Scottish assembly. Whatever the reason for his about-turn, we can rest
assured that it was not caused by the ''power of song'' which he once
claimed was the attraction that drew him into the arms of the CND
movement; no man alive could make a song about devolution.
It is a silly notion that the attainment of independence would take
our country away from us. The opposite is the case. Independence is the
fulfilment of nationhood: through it men and women rediscover their own
land in a great adventure.

TORY MPs have been ordered to comply with the new rules forcing
disclosure of outside earnings, as Labour sought to capitalise on the
humiliation inflicted on the Prime Minister by Monday night's historic
vote.
Labour deputy leader John Prescott said his party would now
concentrate on pressing the Government to allow the Nolan inquiry to
investigate party political funding.
There were angry exchanges at Prime Minister's questions as Deputy
Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, deputising for Mr John Major, resisted
Mr Prescott's call.
Raising claims of bought peerages and donations to the Tories from
foreign businessmen, Mr Prescott challenged Mr Heseltine: ''What has
your party got to hide? Isn't it time that the Prime Minister came clean
on where his party gets its money from or has the Tory Party got
something else to hide?''
Mr Heseltine countered that Labour wanted to see ''one-track'' MPs
with no outside experience.
Mr Prescott said Mr Heseltine and Mr Major were out of step with
public opinion for wanting to keep MPs' outside earnings secret. ''Do
you share my sense of outrage that some Conservative MPs are already
making it clear that they won't observe the decision of the House? Will
you make clear this will be totally unacceptable to you and the Prime
Minsiter?''
Mr Heseltine replied: ''I can say unreservedly on behalf of the Prime
Minister and myself that both of us believe that it is right for all MPs
to enter into the spirit and the letter of the decision taken yesterday
evening. That was the will of the House.''
Earlier, before he left for the Commonwealth heads of government
conference in New Zealand, Mr Major said: ''I have always felt the broad
thrust of Nolan was right. It doesn't mean that I have accepted each
tiny dot and comma. Lord Nolan and his committee were invited to report
to Parliament, not to tell Parliament precisely what to do.''
With a number of backbenchers threatening to ignore the requirement to
disclose outside earnings, agreed by the Commons after 52 Tory MPs voted
with Labour or abstained against Mr Major's express wishes, the
Government had been under pressure to back the will of the House.
The Government was forced to step in to defuse a potentially
embarrassing revolt as a number of Tory MPs made it clear they were
unhappy at the prospect of revealing how much they earned in addition to
their #33,000 annual Commons salary.
Romford MP Sir Michael Neubert claimed the new rule was not ''the law
of the land'' and said he would have to think carefully about whether he
observed it.
Some Tory backbenchers indicated they would consider standing down at
the next election rather than continue under the new arrangements, which
will require them to declare their earnings in bands of #5000 by March
next year.
Mr Alan Duncan, Tory MP for Rutland and Melton, said: ''I think some
people will leave Parliament. I think that is very sad. I think it is
important for democracy and for Britain that it should be a raw cauldron
of interests, of argument, of policies, and if we sanitise it too much
and nationalise it with full-time, incompetent, inexperienced nerds then
you will see a backlash and real disaffection.''
The measure will cut across all parties. Tories with consultancies,
such as Tayside North MP Bill Walker, will be expected to declare their
earnings, as will those such as Labour MP Gordon Brown and Liberal
Democrat MP Charles Kennedy, who write newspaper columns.
Last night, Labour published a breakdown of the vote based on the
Register of Members' Interests, which shows that the Tories who voted
against disclosure hold, on average, twice as many consultancies as
those, such as Eastwood MP Allan Stewart, who voted for openness.
The party plans to write to every Tory MP who opposed disclosure to
demand that they make a full declaration of earnings. Warning that
refusal to do so would be an ''outrage'', Labour shadow Public Services
Minister Derek Foster said: ''We will ensure that every Tory MP who is
listed as having consultancies is asked whether they are contemplating
defying Parliament.''
Shadow Leader of the House Ann Taylor warned: ''Those Conservatives
who voted for secrecy will now have to explain to their constituents why
they voted to continue the cover-up.''

I TRAVEL extensively in Scotland and abroad and I agree entirely with
what Jill Crawshaw has written. Allowing for the many restaurants,
hotels, and museums which do an excellent job in a difficult industry, I
am continually disappointed and angered that in spite of all the good
things Scotland and its people have to offer we never quite manage to
pull it off.
Frowzy hotel bedrooms, sour-faced staff, indifferent food, greasy
cooking smells that linger on the clothes -- a traveller will meet with
these occasionally anywhere from San Francisco to Southend. In Scotland,
to find anything different is a bonus.
Can I suggest one reason why this is so? The Scots don't know their
own country. We get everywhere, we eat anything, we enjoy everything --
so long as it's abroad. Too often, during years of travel in Scotland,
mine has been the lone Scots voice in the dining-room.
At home, I am surrounded by chardonnay nationalists who bad-mouth
anything that isn't Scottish, while never taking the trouble to venture
north of Oban. They sigh over their country's oppression, and reach for
the glossy brochures to get away from it all.
They blame the weather, of course, but while thinking no further than
two weeks in the sun their notion of what Scotland has to offer can
remain safely petrified in memories of biscuit tins, and wet weekends in
Auntie Rita's fusty caravan in the Borders.
Until the Scots start to make higher demands of themselves, in their
tourist industry as in most other things, we will make no progress.
Could we not draft in some Americans to show us how?

MY main gripe against bed and breakfast establishments in Scotland is
the insistence on serving breakfast too early. If you are on holiday the
last thing you want to do is leap out of bed and rush to breakfast at
some unearthly hour, especially after a late night out.
I travel regularly in the Republic of Ireland and this year I booked
into Shillogher House, Kilkenny. While taking in the details of my room
I came across a notice which laid out times for breakfast. My heart
sank, the Scottish disease was spreading. My fears were unfounded, the
notice read: ''Breakfast served in dining-room 8am till 9.30am and
served in bed 9.30am till 10.30am''.
Any intelligent person knows that it's a business being run but the
Irish manage to conduct their affairs in such a way that for the
duration of your stay you are treated like a close friend of the family.
Everyone involved in the Scottish tourism industry should be sent to
tour Ireland for a compulsory period and take note of how things should
be done.

IN response to the series by Jill Crawshaw, how sad and how true. I
make my living from tourism near Oban, an area not visited by her, but
undoubtedly the same would apply.
The norm in Scotland for the average visitor is mediocrity in service,
choice, value, and, in fact, every other aspect which leads to maximum
customer satisfaction and a desire to return again. Good service and
value for money seem to be exceptional.
What is the problem? The things that bring the visitors to our country
-- our scenery (second to none), and our rich heritage -- have been
given to us. Surely then the very least we can do is endeavour to match
their splendour with our own efforts. This means having pride in what
you do at whatever level in the tourism industry.
This is the industry in Scotland now and it affects us all, not just
the obvious points of sale. We have to work hard at it and give our
visitors a reason to come back. There is no shame in working in a
service industry.
Jill Crawshaw's articles have made me even more determined to show to
our visitors that Scottish hospitality is as much to be remembered as
its hills and glens and I thank her for bringing her deplorable
experiences to our attention. I hope others will feel the same way.

WHAT should a Scot do who happens to believe in a small state, low
taxes and frugal public expenditure? The short answer is to get out, but
not all of us can ply our trade anywhere we please.
The trouble is that this point of view is simply not allowed in
Scotland. We have just about got beyond the stage of regarding it as
wicked, even evil, a matter of incredulous horror. It was too obvious in
retrospect that the big state before 1979 had not done us much good.
But the conclusions which follow have still not been drawn, despite
the evidence from other countries, from the United States to New Zealand
to Italy, that the more you roll back the state, the more you prosper.
That is why millions of people round the world want the state to be
rolled back more.
There is in fact plenty of similar evidence in Scotland too. We now
have a richer economy, with more people employed in it, than ever
before, after only the modest rolling back of the state we have
experienced. Coupled with that is the evidence of what happens where the
big state holds out, in a Labour establishment riddled with corruption,
in the monstrous featherbedding of quangocrats and councillors, in the
dependency culture generally and in its inevitable result, the inability
of Scots, politicians and people alike, to think and act for themselves.
Nearly 200 years ago the economist David Ricardo pointed out the
''moral hazard'' of forcing one group in society to pay for the wants of
another. The second group might become better off, but it would also
become worse. Not only would it unlearn the use of its physical and
mental skills, but its morality would degenerate. It would become idle,
venal, selfish.
Ricardo's theory seems perfectly applicable to the era, in Scotland
not yet over, of the big state, high taxes and lavish public
expenditure. It does make Scotland morally worse. A sure sign of that is
the Scottish blindness to the outrage of having the state spend on us
20%, and in quite recent times up to 30%, more than on our British
fellow-citizens.
What is the purpose of a system of public expenditure, beyond covering
the necessary functions of the state? It is surely to take from the rich
and give to the poor, moral hazard or no. There are, of course, many
poor Scots who, on the premises of the system, are entitled to enjoy its
benefits along with the poor in the rest of the United Kingdom. But that
was not the argument deployed by Michael Forsyth during his negotiations
in Cabinet over public expenditure, or by previous Secretaries of State
in their negotiations. They have all said that Scotland as such deserves
more money than any other part of Britain. This argument does not stand
up.
Scotland as such is no longer a poor part of Britain. Our unemployment
is below the average. Our incomes are close to the average, though that
average is pulled up by the high incomes in the South-east of England;
if we contrast Scotland with the other regions of England, Scotland is
richer than almost all of them. And averages conceal much detail.
I live in the Lothian Region, which is the seventh-richest local
authority area in Britain. Hampshire, for example, is poorer. Yet the
system arranges for a net transfer of resources from a man on the same
income in Hampshire to me.
The Secretary of State says I need it or, if I do not, there are
others in Scotland who do. No doubt maintaining the fabric of life in
the Highlands is fantastically expensive, and the sparseness of the
Scottish population is the main traditional pretext for the high public
expenditure. But is the population of Wales less sparse? So far as I
recall, Wales too has a crowded industrial belt with a scattering of
peasants in the mountains beyond. What is more, the Welsh are poorer
than we are. Yet public spending treats them nothing like as generously.
If you look at exactly where the money goes in Scotland, you find that
by far the biggest deviation on any particular item from the British
norm, up to 250%, is on concessionary fares. I would have thought them
largely an urban phenomenon, but I leave that aside.
They are meant mainly for poor pensioners. Yet as a group, pensioners
are not specially poor. Most have a lifetime of earning and saving
behind them, and their financial commitments are over. In recent times
their incomes have risen faster than those of any other group. I am all
in favour of truly poor pensioners going on the buses for free. But I do
not see why rich old ladies should be subsidised to ride into town and
do their shopping.
These are all particular points about a system of public expenditure
which in fact fails to fulfil its purpose, of taking from the rich to
give to the poor. It is not an arrow that hits the target of need
exactly on the bull's-eye. It is a spray of lead from a shotgun that
shoots all over the place.
We in Scotland are one of the big reasons why the aim is so faulty.
Even here, with public money raining down, the best method for getting
some of it is not so much to demonstrate need as to belong to a pressure
group which can exert political muscle and grab it for you. And Scotland
herself is about the biggest pressure group in Britain.
That, presumably, is why we are not allowed to want a small state, low
taxes and frugal public expenditure, not even by the Tory Party. The
Tory Party has proved to be well capable of ruining itself, but this
will be the ruin of us all.

TOYS are magic. Look into the face of a child happily occupied with a
simple plaything -- say a Hornby Military Muscle Men Seawolf Enforcer PT
Boat -- and you glimpse an innocence lost to adults.
Which man among us, in the stale years of his maturity, can still
comprehend the thrill of a Red Dragon Thunderzord with its cute slashing
and maiming attachment? What woman can still appreciate the deep and
very special meaning of a Polly Pocket Wonderful Wedding Party (groom's
family not included)?
It is fashionable, of course, to allege that the modern toy industry
is pernicious. Hand-wringing moralists claim it imposes a false
consciousness on our young, exposing them to baleful influences and
failing to prepare them for life. A glance at any toy catalogue as
Christmas approaches should set minds at rest.
Think as a child might. What could be a better introduction to the
real world of work than the Talking Whiz Kid Power Mouse fun laptop?
With a real little mouse in hand, your child can gain that first,
crucial understanding of repetitive strain injury and spend up to 60
hours a week in imaginative play pretending to stave off redundancy,
just like daddy.
Or what of the VTech Telephone Answering Machine for ages
two-and-a-half years ''and up''? With its 70 pre-programmed messages
(''You're fired''; ''Your divorce is in the oven''; ''Regarding your
overdraft arrangement . . .'') this simple machine, no more expensive
than the real thing, could transform a youngster's communication skills.
It is often suggested, of course, that the toy industry promotes
sexism. Again, the charge is easy to rebut. Nowhere do makers claim that
Newborn Babies -- one black, one white, and each with the sweetest
little umbilical suture -- is intended exclusively for girls. Equally
there is nothing whatever to stop an imaginative lad from enjoying a
Fabulous Hair Friends Salon, or Sindy's ever-popular I Love Make-up
Room.
Indeed, given that child-rearing is clearly a joint responsibility in
our dual-income society, it would be foolish to believe the Tiny Tears
Safe &amp; Sound imitation baby alarm (paranoia sold separately) is aimed at
one sex only, simply because the catalogue illustrates it with a
photograph of a perfect little girl clutching a sinister pink mannequin.
No, the truth is that the industry does a superb job of gently
familiarising children with social realities. With Lord Mackay working
valiantly to modernise the institution of marriage, a towering My Size
Bride Barbie at only #84.49 seems the ideal gift for the girl (or boy)
who will one day confound every divorce statistic.
Granted, few lives are generally quite as freakishly rose-coloured as
those of Sindy and Barbie, but that doesn't mean toys are out of touch.
Every girl can now appreciate gender differences with Shavin' Fun Ken,
his lifelike three-day growth and his own little razor.
All the world is here for the little lad or lass, in other words, a
bright future laid out step by cheerful step: the Wonderful Wedding; the
Coochy Coo Baby; the Complete Nursery Set; the Shopper Combi Pram; the
Super Cook Kitchen; the Contour Vacuum Cleaner; and, given the
inevitability of another dynamic economic recovery, the Polly Pocket
Magnificent Mansion (Valium prescribed separately).
If all this seems a touch domesticated, never fear. Consider instead
the Robocop Armoured Vehicle, complete with the sort of heavy machine
gun your child can expect to see on almost any high street soon.
Lest it appear that traditional toys are being overlooked, we might
also mention the Hornby Intercity 225 train set, a snip of a franchise
at only #59.99 (track authority sold separately), or the Hornby
Eurostar, a novel item that goes very fast on one side of the room and
slows to an irritating crawl on the other.
Then, as always, there are those much-loved board games: You Be the
Judge -- ''The Game of Real Life Court Dramas'' (wrongful convictions
not included); Lottery -- ''The Game That Is Taking the Nation by
Storm'' (addiction optional); and, for the budding MP in your life,
After Dinner Games -- ''from the Cheatwell company''.
But what do children learn from all this? Research suggests they
master the most important social skill of all: how to watch television
for hours on end like anaesthetised gerbils and buy absolutely anything
it is selling. The game is called My Little Consumer.

SOME readers will be aware of recent developments in Liverpool, a city
with long-established industrial, political, family, and sentimental
ties with Glasgow. Among a number of serious industrial relations
disputes, that in the fire service has attracted most publicity and
attention.
While that dispute is about substantial matters such as job losses and
worsening conditions of service it is also aggravated by an
authoritarian management style which is becoming more widespread -- and
not only in Liverpool.
The other serious dispute, though it has been the subject of much less
media attention, concerns the summary dismissal of 500 dockers -- on
full-time contracts, with the vacancies advertised as part-time by the
Mersey Docks and Harbour Company.
The dismissals are ostensibly for refusing to cross the picket lines
arising from an earlier and still ongoing dispute, between other
dismissed employees of Torside, a company also engaged in dockwork on
Merseyside.
The underlying issues in the MDHC dispute are, however, the attempt by
the company to complete the return to casualisation, and destruction of
the union, made possible by the Government's 1989 abolition of the
National Dock Labour Scheme established after the war.
The dispute on Merseyside is, of course, part of a general shift, by
substantial numbers of employers and endorsed by the Government, towards
an increasingly casualised, insecure, low-paid labour force. This trend
has far-reaching social and economic implications and is now estimated
as affecting more than one-third of all those in employment.
There is also the matter of the right to strike. This is, among other
employment rights, perhaps the most significant: it is a human right on
a par with the vote and freedom of conscience and speech. Its effective
denial allows the unscrupulous (and tempts the normally scrupulous)
employer to reduce pay and conditions to intolerable levels and remove
even minimal guarantees of job security.
Paradoxically, the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company is seeking to
eliminate employment rights and cut its labour costs when it is earning
substantial profits on turnover at levels higher than in the post-war
trade boom. It is also currently in receipt of Government and EU
subsidies.
The TGWU, representing the dockers, is unable to act effectively in
their defence given the severe constraints imposed by the law even in
the case of official, lawful disputes. Britain has never had unequivocal
protection for the right to strike and striking employees remain in
breach of their individual contracts of employment.
British employers' virtual freedom to dismiss strikers and re-hire
them selectively has no parallel in the European Union. The only
comparable, and unfortunate, case is that of the USA where employers
have had the right to ''permanently replace'' strikers since 1938 but
did not exercise it in large numbers until the early 1980s.
The absence in Britain of a right to strike, in the context of
unacceptable employer practices, should be attracting serious national
concern and debate both in itself and as an aspect of the widespread and
continuing erosion of civil liberties and human rights.

I WOULD like to highlight the efforts of one group whose experience
sets the tone for tourism as a whole. The Dunfermline Hoteliers
Association has devoted considerable time and resources to upgrading not
only the quality of their hotels but also to developing the local
tourism product.
In-house they have introduced a series of SVQs -- their investment in
the people in tourism. They have also initiated a varied events
programme: a food festival, a Jazz and Blues festival, an Oktoberfest,
and weekend breaks with a variety of themes.
Their faith in Scottish tourism is paying off. Room occupancy rates
are high with ever-increasing numbers of day-trippers and repeat
visitors providing further proof of the health of the local tourism
industry.
These are challenging times for the tourism industry in Scotland as we
strive to retain and expand our market share in the face of stiff
competition overseas. All I would ask is that The Herald presents the
whole story, not one unfortunate chapter, and gives credit where it is
so obviously due.

READING Brian Wilson's latest offering (November 3), it seems Labour
have finally come out of the closet; as the great champions of the Union
between England and Scotland. They are firmly British, and the arguments
in favour of Scotland remaining part of this Union sound suspiciously
like those used by the Tory party.
With one crucial difference, a devolved Parliament for Scotland which,
as most sceptics realise, has more to do with stemming the tide of
Nationalism, and ensuring a Labour majority at Westminster, than it does
with democracy.
He implies that the ''fundamentalists'' (Scottish Nationalists) are
like those awful Quebecois who were trying to ''steal'' Quebec from the
people who also live in Quebec, but who are not ethnically French
Canadian.
Any country that was taken by force, as Quebec was, or that was bribed
into submission, as Scotland was, has a lasting suspicion that its best
interest has not been represented by the people who took it over.
This suspicion has as much to do with the geographical location of
where they live, and how their locality is treated, as it does with the
''ethnic'' origin of the citizen.
Where his article truly becomes farcical is blaming the Nationalists
for absorbing so much of Labour's energy, that should be used on
''real'' issues. Fundamental ones such as the nuclear arsenal on the
Clyde, decent pensions for our elderly, and the restoration of benefits
to our 16- and 17-year-olds -- issues which Labour does not address, but
the SNP does. People of all ethnic origins in Scotland are noticing
this.

SINCE Brian Wilson is now so delighted with the Union and almost
enamoured of its many gifts showered on Scotland like Trident, local
government reorganisation, educational changes, and taxation -- all of
which will remain unchanged as he knows in any subsequent Westminster
Parliament -- perhaps he feels an affinity with the Quebec student he
quotes (November 3).
Can we assume that Brian Wilson would have been rejoicing on May 1,
1707, to find that his country had been taken away from him by an
unnecessary Treaty of Union?

I HAVE just completed my eighth year as a Scottish tourist guide. In
that time I have shown Scotland to literally thousands of people.
Three weeks ago I conducted a group of journalists from English
regional papers on a tour as part of the Scottish Tourist Board Autumn
Gold promotion. It was spectacularly successful.
There are very many good things going on -- the wee boys and girls in
our hotels who take the trouble to learn some German or French phrases,
the dentists who are called out late at night for a case of raging
toothache and waive their fee, the staff at places like Inveraray Jail
who have gone to great efforts to learn the languages of their visitors.
I think The Herald owes it to those going that extra mile in the
tourism industry to give them credit for it.

THE Gulf War which ended Saddam Hussein's ambitions in Kuwait has left
an unfortunate medical legacy, whose existence is not properly
recognised by the British military authorities. Many of those who served
in Desert Storm, the main operation which overthrew the Iraqi army, have
developed unusual, nasty, and often acutely debilitating, medical
conditions. British sufferers are not unique, for a large number of
American soldiers seem also to have encountered a range of afflictions.
In the American case, a connection between these conditions and the
experience of the sufferers in the field has been accepted along with
the costs imposed by the conditions on the soldiers involved. The
Americans have also launched a major programme of studies to assess the
full nature and extent of the various conditions which have emerged and
been linked by the phrase ''Gulf War syndrome''. Their reasoning is
obvious: if the very nature of contemporary warfare with its
sophisticated technology is going to have what conveniently might be
called ''side effects'' it is better that these are understood from the
beginning and taken account of in planning and executing military
operations. Putting that another way: the Americans are placing
themselves in a position to identify and accept a new kind of real but
temporarily elusive battlefield casualty.
The British military -- and Governmental -- response has been very
different. Basically it denies the existence of Gulf War syndrome
altogether. It does not deny the existence of individual cases of acute
illness but its medical men can identify no linkage, no common factor.
We apparently believe that, given the size of the British involvement, a
similar range of ailments might reasonably be expected to emerge from
any similar-sized deployment in a contemporary military campaign. In
other words, what has been experienced by the afflicted men in this case
represents a normal statistical distribution. This seems highly
improbable. Nothing even remotely comparable was found in the aftermath
of the liberation of the Falkland Islands. Of course, participants there
were not exposed to a range of prophylactics against tropical diseases
and toxic chemical warfare. And there was no atomic artillery used. But
that is, of course, the point -- the war against Iraq was a very hi-tech
affair. It was novel, and that some of its fall-out should also be novel
need occasion little surprise.
Admitting this novelty in the unusual casualties would involve
considerable costs. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that this factor
is a very large one in closing some British minds to the possibility
that something new as well as nasty is involved here. The Defence
Committee of the House of Commons is fully justified in calling on the
Defence Chiefs to institute an inquiry and investigation into this
affair. What has been done so far has satisfied no-one and its contrast
with the American response, even allowing for the huge budget at the
Americans' disposal, is disturbing. There has been some British
investigation but it can hardly be said to have been sustained. The use
of the word ''syndrome'' refers to conditions which may not easily be
recognised as being related. That old saw of researchers -- ''more work
has to be done'' -- seems all too true in this case. A thorough
investigation is owed to the sufferers who look to be casualties of war,
though not admitted as such by the Ministry of Defence. The official
attitude seems tainted by a mean sense of economy rather than
intellectual scepticism. Men who risked their lives in the Gulf feel let
down. They, their families and dependants, need to be reassured.

TWO men were injured when a gun was discharged accidentally by a
shooting-party colleague on Gospetry Estate near Gateside in Fife
yesterday.
One man was struck on his right arm and chest, and the other received
injuries to his left arm. They were taken to Queen Margaret Hospital in
Dunfermline for treatment where their injuries were described as minor.

THE authority of the Prime Minister is a thing of rags and tatters
this morning. He has suffered a serious reverse in the House of Commons
over the Nolan affair and will find no solace in New Zealand. An opinion
poll in England last week illustrated convincingly what everyone had
expected; that Mr Blair and the Labour Party had by far the best of the
conference season. Our System Three poll this morning shows that
languishing Scottish Tories need expect no help from the SNP in denting
Labour now that the antique froth and nonsense of Braveheart has finally
blown away. To begin at the beginning with the Nolan affair; there is a
strong feeling that Mr Major established the Nolan Committee because he
thought it would relieve him of a serious problem, although five minutes
of serious thought could have expelled any such notions. Subsequently it
appears clear that although the Prime Minister should have been aware
that many of his MPs were badly out of touch with public feelings on the
issue of full disclosure he allowed himself to be persuaded into a
disastrous course by a minority of agitators. Was the Prime Minister
genuinely convinced by their arguments, indeed so sufficiently convinced
that he changed his own original stance on disclosure? More likely is
the view that he was bounced into unwise action because appeasing rebels
and right-wingers has become something of a habit.
To say this is to assert that Mr Major himself is out of touch with
public opinion. If this is true it is a serious situation for a
political leader who has never appeared at ease with political
machinations or the manoeuvrings and manipulations of Westminster, but
who was at his best when standing on a soap box articulating simple
nostrums which held immediate, if short-lived, appeal. If Mr Major has
lost even this minor political talent of discerning, however dimly, the
public mood and responding, he is in trouble indeed.
Yet there is another serious charge to be made against the Prime
Minister, and that is that he has failed utterly to act as a leader. His
actions are responses to the moods and behaviour of others, and as the
''others'' in question are principally the extremists and noise-makers
in his own party, his problems are multiplied. He is not alone in
shouldering blame for the lack of leadership and management within the
Conservative Party. He has been most disgracefully let down by party
Whips who, if they had the slightest shred of conscience, should resign
immediately. On two occasions they have failed to warn him of trouble.
Firstly over the Family Homes and Domestic Violence Bill where the Whips
ignored the rumblings among the extremists, and secondly on the Nolan
affair where, having failed to warn the leadership of the mood in the
party, the Whips became invisible on the night of the (admittedly free)
vote.
This is not a defining moment in the collapse of a Government, not
yet. The Budget next month presents Mr Major with probably the last
chance to resuscitate both his party and his own position at the head of
it. His options are clear: he must reassert his leadership and impose a
coherent will on the party, and he must stop listening to every noisy
eccentric on his back benches in the fond hope that they might have
answers which have eluded proper political thinkers. If he does this,
and if his Chancellor manages a Budget which is sensitive to the needs
of the nation rather than to the needs of Conservative voters, he might
yet drag back part of the Labour lead. Somehow, though, we doubt it.

A PAINTER forced to watch as workers jumped from the Piper Alpha oil
rig into the North Sea began a High Court action yesterday to win
compensation for psychiatric damage.
Mr William Hegarty, 43, was aboard the rig-support vessel Tharos a few
hundred metres from the Piper Alpha when the first of a series of
explosions ripped through the oil rig on July 6, 1988.
Mr Hegarty's counsel, Mr Jonathan Waite, said rig owners EE Caledonia
had failed to protect Mr Hegarty under their statutory duties and, as a
result, he suffered psychiatric illness.
Mr Hegarty, of Alexandria, Dunbartonshire, had been gathering blankets
for the injured as the Tharos moved towards the blazing Piper Alpha rig,
when it exploded.
Mr Waite said: ''There were people in the water swimming towards the
Tharos. The sea was ablaze because of the oil on the surface.''
Further explosions forced the Tharos to retreat.Mr Hegarty was taken
off the vessel by helicopter.
He told the hearing: ''There was a massive explosion which came over
the Tharos and I ran and began praying for my life.''
The hearing continues.

IT was the Liberal candidate in a recent by-election who confused a
group of sixth formers by describing Westminster as ''the harlot of
parliaments''.
This, it transpired, was meant as an attack on the voting system
rather than on the personal morality of lady members. However, whatever
the past prerogatives may have been, you are more likely to find
responsibility without power in the Commons than the opposite way round.
Free votes are fun in the Commons even if some are freer to vote than
others. When the Whips come off then so do the wheels and all sorts of
splendid confusion results. And so has the Westminster gravy train hit
the buffers or will the Alan B'Stards of this world merely find
inventive new ways to have their greasy palms crossed with yet more
silver?
At first sight the Commons has taken a substantial step at muckin oot
the byre as they might put it in the North-east. One thing that payments
to MPs do not thrive on is publicity and openness.
There are, to be sure, several honourable members with the brass neck
to have something to declare and to keep taking the money. However, in
these days of heavily publicised snouts in the corporate trough,
companies are unlikely to be as enthusiastic about such financial
donations being exposed to the light of day.
The Commons debate on Monday night had an unreal quality to it not
helped by the Leader of the House's almost total inability to explain
the exact nature of the Select Committee proposals.
Even Ted Heath, who is usually good on these sort of occasions,
produced the extraordinary argument that MPs had a right of privacy for
their financial dealings connected with their public duty.
Well, MPs and particularly their families have, or should have, a
right to privacy. However, it would be remarkable to extend this to
concealing the amount of payments made in connection with their service
as public representatives. Even the grandest of old men should be
prepared to tell us how many grand he is making from political services.
On this can I say to reader Michael Ashmore who is concerned to find
out how much I am paid per epistle in The Herald that the answer is
#127. This is excellent value for money even for a Tory-inclined reader
and is, in fact, covered by the rules on declaration which I voted for
on Monday evening.
What Heath did was to provide an inadvertent insight into how this
measure will be avoided by some of his colleagues. In the course of the
debate he, almost casually, remarked that none of his own outside
interests had anything to do with the House of Commons.
I am sure that in his case that this statement will be true. What is
also certain, however, that some of his less scrupulous colleagues will
find it impossible to define ''advice'' in such a way as to remove it
from connection with parliamentary duties and thus from the declaration
of earnings.
There is a second dodge available to less than honourable members. The
impact of Nolan and the new rules will make it much less attractive for
companies to pay Members of Parliament directly. To do so will incur the
sort of public odium which few companies are able to regard with total
equanimity.
What better way to proceed, then, but to shelter payments behind the
screen of one the myriad of lobbying organisations which have sprung up
in Westminster over the past decade? As ever in regulation, one effect
of a tightening of the corset will be to create bulges elsewhere.
It was to this abuse that the Nolan Committee devoted one of their
strongest calls for immediate action saying that ''we can see no
justification for consultancy agreements between Members and public
relations or lobbying firms which are themselves acting as advisers and
advocates for a constantly changing range of miscellaneous and often
undisclosed interests.''
To their great shame both Tory and Labour on the Select Committee
agreed to sideline this clarion call for action claiming that this was
already covered in the present declaration-of-interest rules which ask
for the identity of the final beneficiary as well as the lobbying
intermediary.
In fact, many MPs simply enter the words ''various clients'' which is
hardly helpful in identifying who is paying the piper. An SNP amendment
which would have stopped MPs having financial contracts with such
multi-client companies went down by 243 votes to 48 with the Labour
front bench not only sitting on their own hands but urging their back
benchers to abstain.
Given that the Tory vote against this was actually less than on
disclosure this issue could have been won. To paraphrase the Labour
campaign against the Tories on disclosure I am wondering now what Labour
have to lose from the end of such agreements.
The Prime Minister emerged as the big political loser on Monday night.
On the same issue of financial sleaze he used to have a reputation
better than that of his party. As a result of first starting Nolan and
then trying to stop it, it is now just as bad and no criticism could be
harsher.
In terms of winners, perhaps the reputation of MPs will move up a
fraction but I doubt whether it is just financial sleaze which has
brought the House of Commons into such disrepute.

CAMPAIGNERS against the Dangerous Dogs Act held a funeral service
yesterday for a bull terrier which lost a four-year fight to escape a
destruction order.
The terrier named Buster was destroyed last Friday after Walton Street
magistrates in south-west London issued the order, saying there were no
further appeals following the long-running debate over whether it was a
pit-bull.
About 20 campaigners had collected the animal's body from Fulham
police station in London.
The funeral, at which poems were read and wreaths laid, took place at
a farm belonging to Dr Roger Mugford, a dog psychiatrist and animal
campaigner who has treated two of the Queen's corgis.
Buster, owned by pensioner Sam Crothers, 77, of Fulham, was seized in
October 1991 following a complaint from a neighbour about its barking.
Mr Crothers claimed the animal was a Staffordshire bull terrier.
Mr Crothers told campaigners that he was too upset to attend the
funeral.
His son Sam has now taken over the legal battle which is set to move
to the European Court of Human Rights.
A spokesman for the Endangered Dogs Association said: ''We also want
to find out who the vet was who administered the injection.
''There may be some sort of legal proceedings to be taken against him
at some later time.''
Dr Mugford, who works at the Animal Behaviour Clinic, Chertsey,
Surrey, said Buster had been buried alongside two other alleged
dangerous dogs which he said had been ''killed by the system''.
''Sam lives in fairly poor circumstances in London and he cannot bury
it in his own garden, while we have a little wood where there will be
three dogs who have died as a result of this cursed legislation.''
He said the ceremony would help the owner deal with the grief of
''losing a family member''.
In a written statement, the Metropolitan Police said the animal had
been seized for being unmuzzled contrary to the Dangerous Dogs Act.
Magistrates had issued a destruction order in October 1992.

AN American navy submarine rescue vessel was flown into Glasgow
Airport from San Diego early yesterday morning for a crew rescue
exercise in the Clyde later this month.
The 50ft deep-submergence rescue vehicle was then driven by road to
the Faslane Naval Base on the Clyde. It will be used alongside a similar
British commmercial craft, the LR5, in the mock rescue of personnel on
board the Vanguard class submarine HMS Victorious.
According to the Royal Navy, the two submersibles will be attached to
two hatches on top of HMS Victorious, acting as a stricken submarine,
allowing the crew to escape. The trial will also involve the frigate HMS
Campbeltown and a multi-service craft, Nordica.
The American vessel has been in service since 1971, can operate at a
depth of up to 5000ft, travel at speeds of up to four knots, and
accommodate 24 rescued crew members. It has also an external arm which
can prise open the hatches of a crippled submarine.
After the exercise, the submersible will be flown back to the US where
it will be available to all Nato submarines in the event of an
emergency.

Against all the odds Lochgelly North School is flourishing. Dick
Louden reports on how staff, parents, and pupils are achieving
remarkable success
SOME of the richest crops grow in apparently infertile soil. Set in an
economically deprived area of Fife where one in eight adults is
unemployed and 20% of children live with lone parents, Lochgelly North
School provides for 18 pupils aged between two and 19, nearly all with
severe physical disabilities.
The task is enormous, yet a prestigious report published today states
that ''the school will never appear in league tables of examination
performance but if there were such measures for staff dedication and
parental support and satisfaction it would rank among the best in the
United Kingdom''.
''Success Against the Odds'', the final report of the National
Commission on Education, offers case studies of 11 UK schools in
disadvantaged areas which have worked wonders when failure could
reasonably have been expected.
Lochgelly North was the only Scottish school in the project, which in
each case involved an evaluation by three professionals -- one from
education, one from business and one concerned with economic
regeneration. Lochgelly's assessment team consisted of Professor John
MacBeath, director of the Quality in Education Centre at Strathclyde
University; Ron Lander, managing director of Scotlander plc, a business
training consultancy; and Ron Cully, managing director of Govan
Initiative.
What enthused the research team to describe Lochgelly as ''a very
special school'' when it was once called ''a dumping ground for weans
that nobody else wanted''? The array of problems facing a staff of three
full-time teachers, three instructors and three auxiliaries is
formidable. Ten pupils have severe mobility problems. Seven suffer from
epilepsy, four from cerebral palsy and one from Down's syndrome. Nine,
including two who are autistic, have emotional and behavioural
difficulties.
Success like Lochgelly's cannot happen without a head teacher of
quality, and the research team pays tribute to Maureen Lorimer, a
teacher in the school for eight years and its head since 1992. Apart
from her ''conviction and commitment to a robust educational
philosophy'', her strengths lie in ''an openness and willingness to
learn from the youngest member of staff or from the newest of parents''.
In the words of one parent, ''she doesn't carry her professionalism in
front of her''.
Maureen Lorimer herself attributes the national recognition her school
has attracted to ''the active role we encourage the children to play,
our focus on rewarding success and achievement, and our ethos of respect
-- everybody values everybody else''.
The research team agrees. Lochgelly North is classed as
''exceptional'' in the values shared by all its staff and communicated
to pupils and parents in terms of high expectations. Parents come into
school, observe and work with their children, and help them consolidate
their skills at home.
Parents are learning to take risks and avoid being over-protective.
When five-year-old Fiona first ventured out to stand for five minutes in
the pouring rain and her teacher joined her -- to share and celebrate
her achievement -- Fiona's mother might have reacted adversely but did
not. She had come to appreciate the value of independent behaviour.
The culture of Lochgelly North is to acknowledge every target which is
met. These targets are agreed with parents and each achievement is
recorded, not only in writing but on videotapes which are sent home
along with daily diaries of pupil activity. Parents read, and respond
to, the diaries, explaining what has been happening at home. This close
link between home and school is a critical factor in Lochgelly's
success.
Maureen Lorimer has united the community behind the school. ''When the
children go out shopping or learning road safety, they meet the same
friendly people and develop their social skills. When we do
fund-raising, the community offers us tremendous support. Fife region
has a strong structure for special education and our links with local
schools are excellent -- Lochgelly High is going to help our children
develop a focus on technology.''
Pupils have made gigantic strides. Mark, aged 16, arrived two years
ago with a report describing him as aggressive and unresponsive.
Lochgelly North taught his mother to focus on positive aspects of his
behaviour instead of control and confrontation. Now his aggression is
almost non-existent, he likes taking responsibility for younger children
and his learning has developed -- he has good concentration, understands
fairly intricate text and does simple addition in his head.
Kelly, who will be four next month and has complex learning
difficulties, came to the school over a year ago. According to Maureen
Lorimer: ''She wasn't interacting with her environment -- she wasn't
reaching for objects, wasn't moving around, had only fleeting eye
contact and ate only pulped food.'' The school drew up a programme for
her, involving all staff plus visiting therapists. She now brings food
to her mouth, knows which foods she likes or dislikes, has lively eye
contact, and loves exploring.
Most of us take such skills for granted. In the challenging world of
Lochgelly North, they represent major personal progress. If we should
judge schools by what they achieve with the raw materials they inherit,
Lochgelly North is best judged by the verdict of its last school
secretary, Lorraine McLean.
''Watching them go out the door, you wouldn't recognise them as the
same kids. A complete personality change like that; you wouldn't ever
have believed it was possible.''

Anne Johnstone examines the growing incidence of ageism within
companies when employees in their forties are often considered to be
over the hill
CLIVE BURTON was 48 when the public relations company he worked for
handed him his P45. ''They wanted to make salary savings and they could
save more by getting rid of the older people.'' It turned out to be a
false saving because Clive walked away with not just his accumulated
experience in the business but also a number of valuable clients.
He was out of work for more than a year. During that time he applied
for about one job every week. ''I would have applied for more. There
were lots of ads for jobs which looked ideal for me but then at the end
it always said something like 'candidates should be aged 35 or less'.
''Other times no age was mentioned but when I applied, I'd get a reply
saying something like 'You appear to have more experience than we are
looking for'. It was a way of saying they thought I was past it. It just
made me more determined to find somebody who would appreciate the skills
I had on offer,'' said Clive, who comes from Irvine.
His story had a happy ending. He's now 52 and working again, this time
as press officer for the Association of Retired People and Over-50s
(ARP050), which campaigns against ageism on behalf of its 100,000
members.
According to a survey out today, Clive may have been lucky to stay in
work until 48. The research, commissioned by outplacement specialists
Sanders and Sidney, suggests that ageism in the workplace begins to bite
at 42.
Previous studies have concentrated on the so-called Third Age group of
50 to 74-year-olds. The new survey shows that employees as young as 35
are being excluded from job interviews or offers because of their age.
It's not only because they are seen as more expensive than younger
applicants. They are also viewed by employers as less adaptable and also
less likely to be computer literate.
''Ageism is perceived by candidates to be an ever-increasing threat to
a normal working lifespan,'' says Sanders and Sidney managing director
Frances Cook. ''A key factor may be that company hierarchies are
themselves becoming younger.''
Those aged 35 to 45 said age was limiting their ability to try new
career avenues. For over-45s the issue was whether they would be able to
get any job. We're not talking about people's perceptions here but the
brutal reality of the British jobs market. About 45% cited specific age
limits on job advertising and a similar number had experienced negative
feedback from recruitment agencies or potential employers on account of
their age. Some said they had received no response to applications,
despite holding all the required qualifications.
Such findings come as no surprise to Richard Worsley, director of the
UK's Carnegie Third Age Programme. ''Although we deal mainly with the
over-50s, ageism in the jobs market starts long before that. Every day I
get people in their 40s saying to me that there isn't a hope in hell of
them getting a job. The biggest difficulty is getting over the first
hurdle and getting considered for the job,'' he says.
He calculates that between a quarter and a half of all job ads are age
specific. Even where age isn't specified, some recruitment agencies see
age as a legitimate way of cutting down the numbers of applicants. ''I
suspect some agencies are doing this without the employers' knowledge.
If a company is going to the trouble and expense of advertising, what's
the point of ruling out of consideration a large proportion of those who
apply on arbitrary grounds which have nothing to do with the ability to
do the job?'' asks Worsley.
He believes employers are starting to wake up to the illogicality of
age discrimination which, he says, is a habit they have slipped into
because of a series of mistaken assumptions and flawed stereotypes about
older workers.
The image of the older worker as inflexible and allergic to new
technology isn't borne out by research. In fact, B&amp;Q, the DIY chain,
which has gone out of its way to employ over-50s for several years,
recently published survey evidence showing that the policy has reaped
dividends for both the business and the employees. Older staff emerged
as good team players, who brought a vast reservoir of experience to
their work from previous jobs. They are also highly motivated and
strongly committed to customer service.
The Carnegie Campaign, which has been endorsed by both John Major and
Tony Blair, recently won the support of 90 major company bosses. All
agreed not to use age limits in future recruitment advertising. Most
also pledged to extend their equal opportunities policies to oppose age
discrimination.
This all sounds very heartening for those who feared life ends at 40.
The list includes such big names as Marks &amp; Spencer, Scottish &amp;
Newcastle Breweries and the Royal Bank of Scotland. But, as Worsley
points out, these 90 companies are the ones who replied to the Carnegie
survey on ageism.
''I'm worried about what goes on in the 400 companies which didn't
reply. And even in these 90, I wonder how far these declarations of
intent will go in changing the culture of the company. Will these
policies be adopted by line managers and those involved in the
recruiting process?''
And what about employees themselves? One finding of today's survey
from Sanders and Sidney is that employers think some workers appear to
write themselves off unnecessarily. Clive Burton of ARP050 says older
candidates should try to maintain a positive attitude even in the face
of clear age discrimination.
A neatly printed CV, emphasising their experience, and a properly lit
studio photograph also help. And they shouldn't shy away from new
technology: ''With the correct teaching and a lot of self-help, you can
easily master the basics.''
One of the questions Richard Worsley is often asked by older workers
is ''Should I lie about my age?'' He says that though it's a dangerous
thing to do, it's a measure of their desperation.
Today's report is likely to add further fuel to the debate over the
Labour Party's proposal to introduce legislation to combat age
discrimination. Ageism isn't an issue that will fade away. After all, by
2031 half the British population will be over 45.

ONE member of staff has been sacked and others warned after drunken
employees went on the rampage at Skibo Castle, Peter de Savary's
millionaires' playground in Sutherland.
In a bad week for the #2000-per-year, #300-a-night club, its Rolls
Royce Silver Wraith was seriously damaged in a crash.
A group of staff removed an electric buggy and drove it round the
castle's tree-lined grounds to its marble-lined Olympic-sized swimming
pool, which they broke into.
The workers at the exclusive club overlooking the Dornoch Firth were
said to be under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident,
which happened in the early hours of the morning.
The buggies, used to convey guests round the castle grounds, are
strictly off limits to workers. A group of young butlers were reported
to the general manager by security staff, who heard the disturbance.
Yesterday, Mr de Savary, 50, said: ''The youngsters were drunk and
behaved in a very foolish manner and have been severely reprimanded. One
of the boys had a previous blemish on his employment record and has been
sacked because we will not tolerate that sort of behaviour.
''We have to be very careful with security here at Skibo Castle.
Anyone employed at Skibo should know better than to behave like that. If
they do not, they should not be working here.
''We offer young people a career and a future with the company but
there is a strict set of rules to be adhered to. This is an exclusive
club and our guests do not expect staff to be behaving in this manner.''
To make matters worse for the man who used to own John O' Groats and
Lands End, his prized 1940s Rolls Royce, believed to be worth in excess
of #100,000, was badly damaged in a crash as its driver attempted to
turn off the A9.
Skibo Castle was transformed by Scottish-born American steel magnate
Andrew Carnegie into a building of palatial luxury at the turn of the
century at the modern day cost equivalent of #200m.
Dunfermline-born Carnegie dubbed the castle and the surrounding 8000
acres of grounds as his ''heaven on earth''.
Mr de Savary has spent #15m recreating Skibo's original regal-standard
opulence during the past four years. The Carnegie Club at Skibo Castle
officially opened last April and offers a wide range of top-class
facilities to affluent members from throughout the world.

<TEXT>
HIGH street chemists last night were clearing their shelves of
head-lice treatments containing a pesticide which may be linked to
cancer.
The move came after a Government warning that shampoos and lotions
prepared with carbaryl might be a potential cancer risk.
Ministers decided that, in future, treatments made with carbaryl
should be sold only on prescription.
The change will take effect in the new year. Meantime, the Royal
Pharmaceutical Society has advised its 39,000 members not to sell
head-lice products containing carbaryl over the counter with immediate
effect.
Carbaryl products, which make up about 10% of the market, are sold
under the brand names Carylderm lotion and shampoo, Clinicide lotion,
Derbac-C lotion and shampoo, and Suleo-C lotion and shampoo.
The Government acted after new research commissioned by the makers of
carbaryl found that the drug caused tumours in rats and mice.
While there was no evidence that carbaryl was hazardous to humans, the
Government's committee on carcinogenicity advised the potential danger
could not be ignored.
Dr Kenneth Calman, the Government's chief medical officer, said in a
statement today: ''In the absence of any firm toxicological evidence to
the contrary, prudence dictates that we must assume that what happens in
laboratory animals -- rats and mice -- could conceivably happen in
humans.''
Dr John Maunder, from Cambridge University, an expert on head lice,
assured the public there was no need to worry and the Department of
Health move was ''precautionary''.
If there was any danger from the shampoos, the risk would be ''very
low''.
He said there was a chance that all treatments would eventually be
made available on prescription only -- unless the public learned to use
them properly.
''Although there are only 60,000 cases a year, three million bottles
of preparation are put on children each year in the vain hope of keeping
lice away, so a lot of it is sheer misuse,'' said Dr Maunder.
There are 132,000 prescriptions for carbaryl head-lice products a year
but more would be sold over the counter.
However, carbaryl products are not as popular as some other brands.
Alternative treatments contained malathion, permethrin, and phenothrin
as lice-killing ingredients instead of carbaryl.
The Government asked the French-American makers of carbaryl, Rhone
Poulenc -- which has a plant in Dagenham, Essex -- to conduct the new
research after results from a previous American study proved inadequate.
Under the Control of Pesticides Regulations, 1986, companies must
inform the Government whenever a new problem is discovered concerning a
pesticide.
A spokeswoman for the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said yesterday:
''The society will be writing to all its members today to advise them
not to issue any head-lice preparation containing carbaryl without a
prescription, with immediate effect.
''Pharmacists will be reassuring parents of children who use this
product and advising them of alternatives for future use.
''The point is to reduce the human exposure. If people do want a
preparation containing carbaryl, they should see their GP.''
Seton, Britain's leading suppliers of head-lice products, said it
would be co-operating fully with the changes to the status of treatments
containing carbaryl.
Meanwhile, the Cancer Research charity welcomed the decision as a
''sensible precaution''.
The pesticide is also used in cat flea-collars and animal shampoos.
In a separate move, the Government's veterinary products committee is
considering whether action should be taken over veterinary products
containing carbaryl.

FORMER Rangers and Liverpool manager Graeme Souness last night agreed
to accept just #100,000 of the #750,000 libel damages he won last June
from the People newspaper.
Souness said he had been advised by his lawyers to accept a lower sum
because of ''legal precedent''.
Mirror Group Newspapers, owners of the People, had paid Souness
#250,000 in settlement pending an appeal against liability and the
amount of the damages.
Souness said in a statement issued by his lawyers: ''I received a
massive vindication from a libel jury in my action against Mirror Group
Newspapers. I had asked for an apology and for the right to put the
record straight. The newspaper refused.
''I believe that the size of the award reflected how the jury felt
about Mirror Group Newspapers.
''I have been advised that because of legal precedent it would be
sensible to accept a more moderate sum. My sole purpose has always been
to clear my name.''
Souness, now coach of the Turkish side Galatasaray, had sued following
an article in the People quoting remarks by his ex-wife Danielle.
The award was the fourth highest awarded in this country. An MGN
spokesman said: ''He will have to write a cheque for us.''
People editor Bridget Rowe said: ''This is an important day for our
industry when common sense has prevailed.
''Libel awards against newspapers have been a better bet than the
National Lottery in recent years and, while we still believe this award
to be excessive, none the less it is a step in the right direction in
making these awards more sensible and in line with awards in personal
injury cases.''
In a statement later, MGN said: ''The People never abandoned its
appeal on liability but took the view (that) should it succeed in the
appeal on liability, the mother of his children would have to go through
the ordeal of giving evidence again, and being relentlessly
cross-examined by Graeme Souness's barrister on his instructions, and
consequently the reduction of #650,000 was an offer we were prepared to
accept in order to spare her that ordeal.''
Souness and Danielle were divorced in May 1994. A month later, Souness
married actress Karen Levy, in Las Vegas.

William Russell argues that John Major is, once again, courting
disaster with his apparent policy of appeasing the right-wing
backbenchers in his party rather than providing strong leadership
THERE are times when John Major seems to leave Pearl White -- the
legendary silent screen heroine who was always escaping certain death at
the last minute -- standing.
Reports of Mr Major's political death keep turning out to be
premature, but sometimes one wonders whether he does not occasionally
willfully court almost certain death. Given the latest self-inflicted
humiliation of Monday night's Commons vote on disclosure of members'
interests, may he not this time have done so once too often?
He has, however, shown himself an india rubber man in the past and it
would be foolish to take bets that he will not once again bounce back.
When he wrong-footed his would-be successors in July by calling a snap
leadership election three months early, disposing comfortably of the
only challenger, John Redwood, in the process, it seemed a masterstroke.
He had ensured he would lead the party into the next election.
The worse the opinion polls, the weaker the chances of a pre-election
revival, the greater the readiness of his heirs-in-waiting to leave him
the job of losing it. Then they could pick up the pieces in opposition,
reshaping them to their own satisfaction. If he pulled it off, well
their turn would still come.
The summer recess passed quietly enough, but when Parliament is on
holiday political controversy always dies down. The annual Tory party
conference in Blackpool last month, as ever a stage-managed occasion,
provided Mr Major with a much-needed boost. Having secured his
leadership, he now had to confirm it with the conference and, in the
event, his closing rally speech proved a hit in its own right.
Another bonus was that one of the wannabes, Michael Portillo, who at
times does not appear to know his political onions, shot himself in the
foot with an appallingly jingoistic speech which offended pretty well
everyone. But elsewhere in Blackpool, although not creating waves like
Enoch Powell used to do from the sidelines, the right were doing very
nicely thank you in setting the agenda.
But a political calm is always deceptive and Major's troubles had
begun well before Monday's result. Prime Ministers cannot know
everything, but they must always be seen to be in control, not to be
bowing to pressures, and certainly not to pressures subsequently
revealed to be rather small.
If they do, then the impression is given -- and in politics perception
counts much more than reality -- of drift, muddle and lack of
leadership. Lady Thatcher always led. She might be leading in the wrong
direction. She might be somewhat muddled as to her reasons for chosing
the route. But she always gave the impression of being both keeper of
the road map and the steering wheel. Mr Major can appear to have lost
one and found the other has come away in his hands.
It was the fate of two pieces of legislation sponsored by the Lord
Chancellor, Lord Mackay, on which the right set their sights, that
started things going visibly wrong. First there was the rebellion over
the Family Homes and Domestic Violence Bill.
When launched last February it was so uncontentious it was endorsed by
the Home Affairs Select Committee. The fact is the Tory Whips were
simply not doing their job. They would have known its contents spelt
trouble if they had had their ears to the ground. Admittedly the Second
Reading Committee in the Commons on June 26 only took nine minutes and
the final report stage should have been a simple rubber-stamp affair.
But Government business managers had failed to take the Daily Mail, that
bastion of family values, into account.
The Mail launched a campaign warning that the Bill threatened to
sabotage the very institution of marriage itself by giving radical new
property rights to live-in girlfriends. Lord Mackay was lobbied by Tory
MPs led by Lady Olga Maitland and it duly disappeared from the
parliamentary schedule. Asked why, Mr Major said the Lord Chancellor had
misjudged the mood, but so had everyone else, which was handsome of him
because if there was any misjudgment it was his in allowing the
fundamentalist right of his party to dictate the Bill's fate.
Then there was the row last week over next session's proposed divorce
Bill in which backbench opposition was led by two of the more prominent
Tory dinosaurs, Dame Jill Knight and John Townsend. The result -- a
clear signal from Downing Street that divorce would not be in the
Queen's Speech. But whatever happened to leadership?
The signals from Major at present are not those of a leader of people,
but of an appeaser of backbenchers. Were those MPs opposed really so
strong in numbers that they could not be told to behave without leading
to a Government defeat? Whatever the rights and wrongs the damage was
done to his image.
Then there was the race card played by the Home Secretary, Michael
Howard, and the inference that Europe was no longer at the heart of Tory
policy. Both are vote-catching ploys which voters long ago learned to
recognise as such and appear to be part of a lurch to the right.
Then came the Prime Minister's decision to shift his stance over
Nolan. Having started off believing in complete disclosure, Major ended
up backing the majority report from the Commons Select Committee and
making clear he expected his troops to do likewise. Handed this free
ammunition on a plate, the opposition parties used it to devastating
effect. The Select Committee had decided that a ban on paid advocacy
would be enough, a view with which the outside world did not agree. In
the event, the vociferous band of Tory MPs opposed to total disclosure
proved louder in decibel count than strong in numbers.
But the whole purpose of that July leadership gauntlet he threw down
was to give him the authority to maintain his status quo as a
middle-of-the-road man. In his assessment of his situation he presumably
feels it did not work.
Major, with some justification, accused Tony Blair last week of
squatting in the centre-right, his rightful place and that of the party
he leads. The question is, how did Blair get there if the Tories were
occupying it at the time? The other thing is that he appears not to have
learned the lesson, after the Euro-rebels lost the whip, of what happens
when backbenchers are kept under inadequate control.
Backbenchers, not a lot, but enough to make a loud noise, are once
again shouting the odds.
Having seized the initiative so boldly in July Major appears not to
have known what to do with it, hence this impression of drift, of
concessions to the right, and the renewed doubts about the future.

Does Gulf war syndrome exist? Margaret Vaughan reports on the
suffering of one British veteran
THERE are just two questions James Brenner wants a Government minister
to answer. What was in the biological injection labelled ''The Porton
Down Cocktail''? And were anti-nerve agent tablets tested on humans over
a prolonged period before they were fed to troops every eight hours
throughout the Gulf war?
Brenner was a vital, healthy young man until he signed up for the Gulf
in 1991. He was in the Territorials, kept in shape at 11[1/2] stone,
running, assault courses, fitting in charity work as an entertainer.
After he came home from Riyadh, his weight dropped three stones,
severe arthritis set in, he needed two sticks to walk 100 yards, there's
blood in his urine, liver troubles, every cold turns into a major chest
infection . . . to say nothing of the three suicide attempts, the
troughs of depression, short-term memory loss, fatigue, and sharp mood
swings. Still, at least he's alive. He knows of others who took their
own lives.
Something profound happened to Brenner in the Gulf. Something no-one
has the guts to admit, he says. He's not interested in money;
compensation is not what he's after. Just some honesty, an admission
that something went very wrong, even if it wasn't intended.
The 42-year-old, from Avoch in Ross-shire, is one of the 800 or so
British veterans who attribute their illnesses to service during the
Gulf war. Of the 500,000 Americans who fought in the Gulf, some 20,000
claim to have associated illnesses. Veterans' associations in America
say more than 4000 have died.
The collection of illnesses cited on both sides of Atlantic range from
headaches and fatigue to motor neurone disease, heart conditions, and
cancer. They are popularly known as Gulf war syndrome. And they are
reputedly spreading to family members. Several babies have been born
with deformities. But still the Government insists there is no such
thing as Gulf war syndrome.
Brenner gave up his job as a theatre nurse to serve with the Royal
Army Medical Corps in Riyadh as a surgical team member, a theatre
nursing officer with the rank of lieutenant.
He got all the injections. Some 12 to 16 different drugs. All the
troops were given them. Polio, typhoid, cholera, anti-malaria, tetanus,
pertussis and anthrax, and bubonic plague. And, of course, the nerve
agent pre-treatment sets, NAPS, which the troops had to take throughout
their tour of duty.
''There has been no research into the effects of that cocktail of NAPS
and inoculations,'' says Elizabeth Sigmund, co-ordinator of the Gulf
Syndrome Study Group. ''The damage to the immune system which could be
caused by inoculations administered over short periods might account for
some of the illness. But the NAPS, which were not even licensed at the
time of the Gulf war, and other chemical exposure could well cause other
symptoms.''
Brenner recalls falling ill for two days after the plague injection.
He needed nebulised Ventalyn to open his airways, to breathe, but
thought it was the desert dust. So many things didn't add up then.
When he came home he was diagnosed with severe post traumatic stress
disorder. He has suffered constant ill health since. Brenner is now a
charge nurse in an operating theatre at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness.
His employers have been sympathetic to his long poor sickness record.
He can't sit down at lunchtime without falling asleep. He is
perpetually tired and fretful. Yet his medical records bear testament to
rude good health before he signed up.
''It hurts a lot when people, politicans, imply you are a whinger, a
moaner, some sort of compensation-seeker. That's not the case. I just
want people to admit we were given drugs on trial.''
Nobody will ever know what the families of veterans have suffered, he
says. His mood swings affect his wife and children who are aged six and
eight. He is a different man.
Is it really possible that all these veterans hysterically recount
strikingly similar symptoms? Can women hysterically produce babies with
birth defects? What about the advice given unofficially to 300 or so
young women nurses in Riyadh, told by senior surgeons to put off having
babies for a year or so, which was sharply countermanded when it reached
official ears?
There were so many odd unexplained things happening then. Maybe there
always are in conflict. There was, wasn't there, the insistence that no
chemical weapons were used? Yet the nerve-agent detectors, that look
like portable radiators, used to go off all around Brenner. It was just
the dust, they were told.
Were there chemical or biological attacks during the Gulf war? While
our politicians insist there weren't, the Czech Republic said its unit
detected mustard gas and sarin -- the chemical agent used to murderous
effect in Japan. Traces of sarin were found around the Iraqi border. The
Pentagon later confirmed the Czech findings.
The chemicals could have been released either by a missile or blown on
the wind after allied bombing of Iraqi weapons dumps. In October last
year US Senator Donald Riegle published two reports on chemical and
biological warfare in Iraq and the impact it may have had on Gulf
veterans.
His report confirmed that contrary to the official information from
both US and UK government officials, 2000 litres of mustard gas and
another blister agent were found in August 1991 by members of the UK and
US armed forces after the war in Kuwait, placed there by the Iraqis
during its occupation.
The materials used to test the liquid, all of which showed positive
for a dangerous chemical, were ''turned over to personnel wearing desert
camouflage uniforms with no rank or distinguishing patches''. Riegle was
told that these were UN personnel assigned to the team from the Chemical
and Biological Defence Establishment at Porton Down, employees of the
MoD.
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Defence, Lord Henley, told the
Lords last October: ''There is no evidence that chemical weapons were
used in the Gulf war.''
Brenner believes whatever happened has to be addressed to protect
troops who go into conflict areas in future. And as he speaks you sense,
still, an urgency, a need to explain. This is true. It's real. It's
happening. He wants to be sure you believe. Unfortunately, it's not me
he has to convince.

While Europe presses ahead with paternity-leave legislation without
British participation, Kirsty Scott examines the lot of fathers here
THE agreement between Europe's employers and unions this week to give
fathers and mothers three months' leave after the birth of a baby was
greeted with a mixture of frustration and relief in Britain. The new
deal, which has still to be ratified, will not apply to Britain where
the Government begged off under the social policy opt-out.
The deal provides a minimum of three months off work without pay to
care for a child at any period in the first eight years after birth or
adoption.
Unions and equal opportunity campaigners in Britain say we are being
left behind in the push for better and fairer treatment of workers, but
employers' representatives say the public and private purses could not
afford to add fathers to statutory maternity leave.
At the moment, there is no paternity entitlement in Britain, although
a recent study of 356 organisations across the country found that 69%,
employing almost 2.5m people, had some form of paternity-leave
arrangements. In all but two of the cases, the leave was paid. The most
common reason given for the introduction of paternity leave was equal
opportunities, and the average length of paid leave was five days.
In the rest of Europe the entitlement varies from country to country.
In Ireland, there is no statutory entitlement for fathers, although the
Government is keen to extend the maternity provision for mothers to
their partners.
In France, mothers and fathers can take a year's unpaid leave during
the first three years after the birth. Companies with fewer than 100
employees can opt out. In Germany, either parent can take three years'
leave at #250 a month for the first six months. Those on leave can even
work part-time for someone else if they choose. In Italy, mothers get
six months' leave at 30% of normal pay and can transfer part or all of
that time to the father.
At the offices of the Scottish Trades Union Congress in Glasgow,
assistant secretary Grahame Smith has just taken advantage of the
organisation's two-week paternity leave entitlement.
''Our position at the STUC is that we support the introduction of
paternity leave,'' he said. ''Certainly some employers are making it
part of their conditions of service. It's something which strengthens
the role the father can play in bringing up the children.
''In our own organisation we have two weeks' paternity leave, which
I've just taken. It's very helpful in allowing fathers to be involved at
that very early stage and assisting the mothers at what can be a
difficult time.''
Mr Smith said it would be extremely difficult to draw up the ideal
package of paternity rights, but flexibility should be the key.
''I would think it would be better to be flexible. Certainly from a
union's point of view we would be campaigning for paid leave over a
short period with the option of a longer period of unpaid leave.
''It's difficult to say what would be the ideal. It's very much down
to the company and the workers themselves, and we believe it would be
useful to have minimum standards set by the Government. It's something
that is increasingly on the collective-bargaining agenda. It's just a
sign of the times.''
TUC general secretary John Monks said it was unfortunate that
Britain's parents would not enjoy the entitlement drawn up in Europe.
''But trade unions will now start to negotiate with employers with the
aim of securing them in this country,'' he said. ''Our first target will
be those employers that operate across Europe and will therefore be
granting these rights in European workplaces outside the UK.''
The British Govermment has argued that the issue of paternity leave is
a matter for employers and should not need legislation. Where employers
could afford to give fathers time off they could, but they should not be
forced to. The Government argued that it would prove expensive and make
businesses less competitive.
Paul Walker, of the CBI in Scotland, said yesterday that they
supported the Government's stance on the issue. ''Our position is that
we are supportive of the opt-out on this one, not least because it would
detract from UK competitiveness.''
In 1992, researchers looked at the cost of introducing a statutory
right to fully-paid paternity leave for all employees. The estimates
covered the cost to the Exchequer of a State-funded scheme. If 90% of
employed fathers took paternity leave and if they earned the average
male earnings the wage cost would be about #213m if the entitlement was
five days on full pay.
At the moment, it's estimated that about #60m is spent a year on
providing employees with paid paternity leave.

STIRLING University students have nominated pop singer Ray Davies for
honorary president of the students' association.
The front man of seventies icons the Kinks signed the papers after a
concert in Glasgow when he was approached by student Simon Ward.
Mr Ward, 19, said yesterday: ''Ray is famous without being arrogant,
he knows the area well, and I think he'd be the ideal role model for
students.
''His music has a big following on the campus even today, and has been
a huge influence on contemporary bands like Blur.
''I think the university needs a well-known figurehead to put it on
the map.''
Davies, who wrote Kinks hits including Lola and Waterloo Sunset, joins
another three candidates in the election contest -- newspaper columnist
Mr Bob Shields and undergraduates Mr Jonny Barton, 23, and Mr Matt Lee,
20. Nominations closed yesterday.
Mr Barton, who is studying divinity, wears a kilt to classes and used
to live in a cave in woods on the Stirling campus until thrown out by
university administrators.
He moved temporarily to a disused bunker and now sleeps rough in a
mountaineer's bivouac bag.
He is also known for turning up at lectures wearing only a giant
cardboard box advertising coffee sold direct by Third World traders.
The election, which takes place in two weeks, follows a poll last
month when students, faced with a choice between Prince Edward and
former Special Branch agent Ben Goodwin, a mature student at the
university, voted to re-open nominations.
The post of honorary president is Stirling's equivalent of rector.

Is this the end of supermodel supremacy? John Davidson goes on the
town and faces up to the latest New York dolls during fashion week
NEW YORK, New York. It's one helluva town. And it's a helluva place
for fashion too. All those grand Park Avenue ladies still need a tricksy
little suit (or 10) in which to lunch. And if their idea of dressing for
a charity gala is inspired by those extraordinary doll-figures used by
every respectable suburban household to disguise the spare toilet roll
-- well, Oscar de la Renta, Bill Blass and Carolina Herrera answer such
needs unswervingly.
Is there a more modern answer to the wardrobe needs of the dressing-up
classes? The clean but distinguished lines of Richard Tyler's shantung
suits and shirtwaister dresses seem to be exactly the sort of thing
which Claude Montana would be designing today had he not taken a wrong
turning years ago into a stylistic cul-de-sac. It's so easy to
understand why Tyler's clothes sell so well at trunk shows in key
locations across the US. His tailoring has just enough form and
structure to flatter women edging past their first youth; yet dowdy it
most certainly ain't. And it actually looks expensive.
Which is more than could possibly be said of Anna Sui's youthful
japery. She presented a jolly romp down the Kings Road circa
Beatle-Mod-yester-era. We had Liberty-print mini-dresses,
Dannimac-lookalikes for beachwear (would you believe?), and sparkly
pictures of the designer herself sprinkled over Naomi Campbell's famous
frame in an attempt at after-dark glamour. It might all seem fabulous as
disposable fashion, the stuff of great high street window displays
perhaps, but hardly important enough for a major international runway.
On charges of style without substance, we find Ms Sui thoroughly guilty.
Another of New York's bright sparks, Todd Oldham, lit up the night sky
on Hallowe'en with his unique brand of fashion fireworks. So the
supermodels are extinct? Don't believe a word of it. Almost every last
one of the old darlings pranced down his runway in a multi-coloured
cavalcade of coffee bar mosaic prints, madcap patchworks, and zig-zag or
wiggly-wobbly knits. At their exuberant best, these clothes were kitsch
yet cute; they could happily costume an EastEnders' cast party.
The celebrity models on Oldham's runway were matched by an impressive
front row turn-out, including Matt Dillon, RuPaul, Julia Roberts, Tim
Robbins . . . and celebrating the twentieth anniversary of her
appearance in The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Susan Sarandon. But they
had all missed the real horror show of the day. That had been presented
earlier by British design label, Ghost.
Guests were first tormented by an eerie cacophony of synthesized
sound, manufactured live on the runway by two boffin types who looked as
if their regular instruments must surely be the spoons. Had celebrated
hairstylist Sam McKnight been inspired by the original Rocky Horror's
time-warping Transylvanians when he devised the 10,000 volt freak-out
coiffures?
Consider the loveliness of pedal pushers, trimmed with a hip-circling
frill? Or an evening gown, saucily ruched up the cleft of the derriere?
Or a stretchy A-line skirt in grim grey teamed with matching footless
tights? Yes: all just fractionally more torturous than the synthesizer
music had been.
Oh the struggle to be hip! Marc Jacobs was exhausted in the process.
Maybe he had an idea about clothes for the post-modern American
debutante. That might explain little shantung frocks with a beaded cardi
tossed carelessly around the shoulders. But some of his little
princesses had been forced to take a job on the counter at MacDonalds --
others in a seedy downtown bar.
Ralph Lauren proved that he has no intention of trying to make his
line look hip. Out came perfect, if perfectly unremarkable, tailored
jackets and peacoats with soft, wide pants -- all in navy and cream. Out
they came. And they came. And they continued to come.
Something a little less refined? Essex girl reared her
leather-bottomed end in colourful kid trousers as a presage of bright
colour and black. For a finale, Lauren gave each model a differently
coloured silk column, forming a line-up which was terrifyingly Miss
World.
Lauren accepted his end-of-show ovation dressed in tight black jeans
and a muscle-hugging ribbed sweater. He looked as if he has the body of
a teenage athlete grafted on to the head of a 60-year-old man. Pity then
that all the fashion ideas must have come from the head section.
Although this had been a show packed with clothes which many grown women
would love to wear, it lacked any fashion fizz.
Colour was the big news at Donna Karan. It was a bold (and bare) essay
in skinny shapes and citrus-sharp shades of orange, lemon and lime,
starting with her DKNY tube idea -- a shiny, stretchy pull-up (or down)
effort over which softer, kinder and more shapely garments might be
worn. In her mainline collection, really short or very long skirts came
partnered with a fuss-free jacket fastened by one single hook.
As a passionate demonstration of minimalist modernity, it was all
convincing enough -- if a little difficult to swallow from a designer
who established her name and reputation on the basis of softer, more
woman-friendly view of fashion.
Calvin Klein got it just about right. His show seemed to crystallize
so many of the ideas which have been floating around the fashion ether.
Colour from Calvin? And how! Pastel blues, apricot . . . even his
signature neutrals were coloured up to nude.
This must have been Linda Evangelista's last season on the runways.
She has now bravely owned up to being 30 and must surely now have
reached the point where she should no longer care to display her body in
a backless, frontless, topless, bottomless creation which purports to be
high fashion. It's true that the fashion pack is totally bored with the
original supers. So move over Naomi, Helena, Cindy and Claudia; you are
all past your sell-by date. The new New York dolls are Amber Valetta,
Shalom Harlow, and Scots beauty Kirsty Hume.

A HUSBAND who killed his wife after only three months of marriage when
she began associating with a former boyfriend was jailed for two years
yesterday.
Derek King, 53, was originally charged with the murder of his wife,
Margaret, 47, on July 1 or 2 last year in their home in Balfour Wynd,
Larkhall, but the Crown accepted his guilty plea to the lesser charge of
culpable homicide.
Mr Craig Scott, Advocate-depute, told the High Court in Edinburgh that
the couple married in March last year but both had a drink problem and
the relationship was not particularly happy.
Previously, Mrs King had a relationship with another man and this was
rekindled because of the difficulties with the marriage.
On July 1, there was another row and King handed over the keys to the
house before leaving his wife and the other man. He returned later and,
after another argument about why King should be the one to leave, the
other man went.
In the early hours of the following morning, King went to a
neighbour's house and asked for the police and ambulance to be called
because he thought his wife might be dead.
Police found her body in bed and King told them: ''We had a punch-up
about two hours ago. I think I fell asleep.''
The Advocate-depute said Mrs King had died through choking on her own
vomit while unconscious. The accused had struck her on the head and
while that could not have been the direct cause of her death, it was
enough to have rendered her unconscious.
Mr Ian Hamilton QC, defence counsel, said that in his long experience
in the courts he could not remember a case in which he had tendered a
guilty plea with more reluctance.
King's assault had involved only gripping her by the throat and
slapping her twice on the face but that could not be ruled out as the
cause of her unconsciousness.
Mr Hamilton told the court that the couple had met in the autumn of
1993 when they were drinking soft drinks in a pub and recognised each
other as fellow alcoholics.
Together, they had fought off drink but their relationship was
disturbed by the constant reappearance of the former boyfriend.
Jailing King for two years, Lord Clyde told him that he accepted the
violence used towards his wife was mild but it was none the less rash.
Mrs King's mother last night criticised the sentence.
Mrs Catherine Craw, 72, of Larkhall, Lanarkshire, said: ''It should be
a life for a life.''
The victim's daughter, Ms Diane McIntosh, of Larkhall, said she was
''devastated'' by the sentence. ''I just feel the sentence he got is
nothing compared to what we are suffering.''

LABOUR'S national executive is expected to abandon normal procedures
and appoint current MP Irene Adams as the party's future candidate in
the trouble-torn Paisley North constituency without putting it to a vote
of local members.
The executive will now step in after the Scottish Labour Party
yesterday cancelled tonight's first meeting of the new constituency
party after numerous complaints about irregularities.
Halting the meeting is tacit admission by Labour's senior officials
that they have been unable to clear up the party's difficulties in the
Paisley area where there have been allegations of manipulation of
membership numbers and tenuous links to drug dealing and money
laundering.
Mrs Adams, who has publicly stood up to the drug dealers in Paisley,
was said to be so incensed at sinister attempts to remove her as
Labour's candidate that she was threatening to resign as MP and expose
under parliamentary privilege alleged links between certain local Labour
members and crime.
With Labour running such a high-profile campaign against so-called
Tory sleaze, the continuing problems in Paisley will cause the party
considerable embarrassment.
Three neighbouring constituency parties -- Paisley North, Paisley
South, and Renfrew West and Inverclyde -- were suspended in the summer
as there were claims they were run irregularly. One allegation was that
140 new members had their Labour Party subscriptions paid for by the one
person. With Labour now running a one-member one-vote system to choose
future candidates, buying memberships is a way that the system could be
easily abused, particularly in constituencies with low levels of
membership.
After the summer suspension, officials at Labour's Glasgow
headquarters attempted to reorganise the party locally. The end result
was supposed to be a meeting of the new Paisley North Constituency
Labour Party tonight. As further complaints rolled in, Scottish general
secretary Jack McConnell took the decision to cancel it.
He conceded that there had been a number of complaints concerning the
meeting, which was why it was being postponed ''until further notice''.
''This constituency has been recently suspended and it will not be
formed again until we are satisfied that the business can be carried out
in a satisfactory manner within the rules of the party,'' he said.
Although he did not specify what the fresh complaints were, they are
likely to be about whether proper notification of meetings was given and
whether delegates from the various branches were properly chosen to be
office bearers within the new CLP.
Another suggestion which had been made is that supporters of Renfrew
West and Inverclyde MP Tommy Graham had been attempting to take over
Paisley North and instal Mr Graham as candidate there. Due to boundary
changes, it is said Mr Graham would have a better chance in Paisley
North.
However, Mr Graham told The Herald this week that he never had any
intention of standing in Paisley North and wished to continue as the
candidate in Renfrew West.
The next move is expected to be the involvement of Labour's national
executive committee in appointing Mrs Adams as candidate in the hope
that will give officials a breathing space in order to finally get the
local party machine working properly.
The involvement of the NEC is rare but, given the lengthy bad
publicity over the Labour administration at Monklands District Council,
the Labour Party is keen to avoid giving its opponents further
ammunition with a lengthy, acrimonious internal battle over Mrs Adams's
future.

SNOOKER player Alex ''Hurricane'' Higgins yesterday was fined #150 for
being drunk and disorderly after a court heard how he staggered around a
road, swearing and shouting abuse at police.
Magistrates in Northwich, Cheshire, were told the former world
champion had to be handcuffed by three officers as he struggled when
they arrested him near the town at 3am.
Higgins, 46, was the passenger in a friend's Mercedes on his way home
from a charity celebrity golf tournament when the car was stopped and
the driver breathalysed.
The snooker player had pleaded not guilty to the offence on May 3 and
claimed police had been telling a ''pack of lies''. However, he was
found guilty and was also ordered to pay #114 costs.
Inspector Peter Hulse said, when he arrived at the scene on the
Northwich by-pass after other officers had responded to reports of three
drunken men in a car, Higgins was swearing and shouting. He said his
speech was slurred, his eyes were glazed, and he was staggering around,
shouting abuse.
Constable Phillip Sale said Higgins had waved his mobile phone under
his nose after asking him to leave the car driver, Cedric Ulett, 38,
alone.
When a woman officer tried to remove the ignition keys, he told her;
''You are not having the f...ing keys.'' He shouted at a group of
officers: ''Look at all you f...ers in uniform.''
Higgins, of Station Road, Cuffley, Hertfordshire, said the police
version of events was ''totally untrue''. He said he had been at the
celebrity day at Portal Golf Club, near Tarporley, Cheshire, and had
drunk two and a half pints of shandy.
''We were not drunk. I am positive,'' he said. ''The police pulled us
in and within two minutes there were four police cars there and about
nine officers. They seemed to arrive like a posse.
''It was like a pantomime. I thought it was the Great Train Robbery. I
wasn't abusive. I asked a few questions. I thought what a rotten end to
a great day. I may have sworn once but there wasn't a tirade as we have
heard today.''

<TEXT>
A LOCAL Enterprise Company director in Argyll has sparked a row with
one of Britain's leading hotels groups.
The Glenburn Hotel on Bute has been criticised by Argyll and the
Islands Enterprise director Norman Lamond as being of little economic
benefit to the area because of the type of tourists with which it deals.
The 125-bedroom hotel, which is owned by Torquay-based Shearings Coast
and Country Hotels, brings coach parties of mainly elderly or retired
holidaymakers to the Clyde island.
Mr Lamond, in a letter to his local newspaper The Buteman, said the
potential to further develop festivals, small conferences, and other
events in Rothesay had ''been greatly restricted by the Glenburn's
concentration on a type of tourism which brings little economic benefit
to the island''.
His views have incensed management at the hotel group's headquarters.
Mr Vince Flowers, operations director for Shearings Coast and Country
Hotels -- which owns and operates 30 hotels throughout the UK -- said
the company was ''appalled at the outrageous comments'' made by the AIE
director.
The hotel, which employs 55 local staff, has an annual wage bill of
#260,000. ''It is reasonable to assume that a significant amount of this
money finds its way into the tills of other businesses on the island,''
said Mr Flowers.
According to the company, more than 800 coaches bring around 30,000
tourists to the Glenburn each year.
Since 1992, more than #500,000 has been spent by Shearings on
refurbishing the Glenburn and a similar sum is to be spent over the next
three years, developing leisure facilities.
Mr Norman Walker, chairman of AIE, said: ''Our director was trying to
make the wider point that we are anxious to see a variety of quality
hotels coming into the area so that the island can cope with the added
surge of tourism as a result of our financial support to Mount Stuart
House.
''I have personally been associated with the work the Shearings group
does and realise the benefits of trading with them throughout the
year.''

Arms-to-Iraq again embroils Ministers
SENIOR Ministers were last night facing resignation calls after a new
arms-to-Iraq row exploded around the Government.
The Appeal Court overturned the convictions of four businessmen found
guilty of plotting to send military hardware to Saddam Hussein after
ruling that vital evidence was blocked by Ministers.
Lord Justice Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, ruled that the decision
to withhold official papers effectively denied leading figures in the
arms company Ordtec the chance to argue in their defence that the
Government turned a blind eye to their activities.
The finding brought instant demands from the Opposition for the heads
of the Ministers responsible and an awkward admission from the
Government that the allegations were ''very serious''.
The case closely mirrored the failed Matrix Churchill trial -- in
which Ministers faced almost identical accusations -- that led to the
setting up of the Scott Inquiry into defence exports to Iraq.
The Ministers at the centre of the new row are Mr Peter Lilley, then
Trade and Industry Secretary and now at the Department of Social
Security, and Home Secretary Michael Howard, with former Ministers
Douglas Hurd, then Foreign Secretary, and Mr Kenneth Baker, former Home
Secretary, also implicated.
All four signed public interest immunity certificates -- so-called
gagging orders -- seeking to prevent crucial Government documents being
disclosed to defence lawyers at both the original trial in 1992 and at
the appeal.
Lord Justice Taylor said: ''We cannot regard the convictions as safe
or satisfactory.''
In his judgment, he added: ''We are satisfied that the documents now
before the court ought to have been made available before the trial.
''This was not a case of the defence seeking disclosure simply in the
hope that some undefined defence might emerge. It was not a fishing
expedition.
''The defence frankly indicated they were contending that the
authorities had turned a blind eye to what they were doing.''
Labour and the Liberal Democrats seized on the ruling to step up
pressure on the Government as it awaits the findings of the much-delayed
Scott report.
Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook called for the sacking of
Ministers found to have exploited loopholes in the law to save
themselves embarrassment.
''Once again Ministers have been caught out trying to cover up their
role in the supply of arms to Iraq. The Ordtec businessmen have been
acquitted but Ministers are now in the dock,'' he said.
Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell echoed the
resignation call and said it was a ''devastating blow'' to the
credibility of the Government.
''It demonstrates again that Ministers and officials were prepared to
allow British businessmen who had been assisting the security services
run the risk of going to jail,'' Mr Campbell said.
But Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine accused the Opposition
parties of trying to exploit the ruling for the ''narrowest and basest''
of political motives.
''It is a very serious situation. The issues raised by the Ordtec
decision today are within the view of Sir Richard Scott and we know that
he intends to deal with it in his report.''
The four businessmen were charged with conspiring to export an
assembly line for heavy artillery shell fuses to Iraq by using false
documents showing the ''end user'' of the equipment as Jordan.
Ordtec managing director Paul Grecian, technical manager Bryan Mason
and Mr Stuart Blackledge, a project engineer with ''super gun'' makers
Space Research Corporation, received suspended jail sentences.
Mr Colin Phillips, who worked for shipping agency EC Transport, was
fined #1000.
They pleaded guilty but claimed they entered pleas under pressure from
the Government which was unwilling to admit its own involvement in the
supply of military equipment to Baghdad.
Documents later released to the defence in the Appeal Court, either
voluntarily or by order of the judge, showed that Mr Grecian was working
for MI5, MI6, and Special Branch at the time.
After the judgment, Mr Grecian said the prosecution had led directly
to the collapse of the Reading-based arms company.
Mr Grecian said the story of the undisclosed documents was ''a pretty
sorry mess'' but it was what he had come to expect.
Mr John Morris, Shadow Attorney General, said last night he would be
writing to the Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell asking for an
assurance that the material before the Court of Appeal would be referred
to the Scott Inquiry.
Mr Baker said last night in a statement: ''The judgment . . . makes no
mention of the public interest immunity certificates signed by Peter
Lilley and myself in relation to the Ordtec trial.
''It refers to assurances given by prosecuting counsel to the defence
before the trial. Ministers would not be involved in such assurances.
The public interest immunity certificates were not used.
''The certificate I signed did not seek to withhold any documents as
it related only to the verbal evidence of a witness and I set out in the
Scott Inquiry the reasons for signing that certificate.''
* British firms were duped into supplying #6m of vital guidance
systems for Iraqi Scud missiles around the time of the Gulf war and
afterwards, it was claimed last night.
The shipments, over a three-year period ending in November, 1991,
violated UK controls on the export of missile technology before the Gulf
crisis and UN trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
according to London's Evening Standard newspaper.
The components were for gyroscopes for guidance systems and made by up
to two dozen companies in London and the South-east, none of which
suspected the use to which they would be put, the paper said.
At the centre of the affair was a small west London firm, now in
liquidation, which took delivery of hundreds of components which
eventually found their way to Baghdad. The companies involved all
provided, in ignorance, a small part of the whole system.
After the UN trade embargo at the end of the Gulf war, at least one
consignment of components was shipped as ''dental equipment'' so it
could be classified as humanitarian aid and so circumvent the embargo.

The Lockheed TriStar jet, carrying 233 passengers from Chicago to
Amman via Amsterdam, was over former Yugoslavia when the alarm was

Police said the bomb threat had been received by telephone in
Amsterdam and passed to Amman, which radioed the plane to turn back to
Vienna.
1 Amid turmoil in the Middle East after the assassination of Israeli
premier Yitzhak Rabin, first reports said the Jordanian flight had been
hijacked in mid-air.
However an Israel Radio monitor who listened in on the cockpit

Amsterdam
A DOCTOR who ended the life of a severely handicapped baby girl made a
correct decision when faced with a haunting dilemma, a Dutch court
found.
The Amsterdam appeal court ruled that Doctor Henk Prins, 50, was not
liable for a criminal penalty, although a charge of murder had been
proven.
Prins gave a fatal injection to Rianne Kunst in consultation with her
parents and other doctors after she was born in March 1993 with a partly
formed brain and spina bifida.
Prins and the colleagues he consulted concluded that the child was in
great pain, had only a few weeks to live and that her condition could
not be improved by operating on her.
Court president Nette Rutten said Prins should not be punished as he
had acted ethically when faced with a stark choice between keeping
Rianne alive and ending her suffering. She said his decision was
''justifiable under the circumstances''.
The case is an important test of Dutch mercy-killing law because Prins
is the first doctor to be prosecuted for ending the life of a patient
who was unable to express her own will.
Euthanasia, though formally illegal, is permitted in the Netherlands,
if doctors act on an explicit request from a patient who is suffering
intolerable physical or mental pain.
Action to end the life of a patient who is incapable of expressing his
or her own will was a grey area under Dutch law, prompting the
government to prosecute Prins to obtain judicial clarification.
If the Supreme Court upholds the earlier rulings, immunity from
prosecution in mercy killings will be extended to cases where patients
are unable to ask a doctor to end their life.--Reuter.

LOS ANGELES: Model Anna Nicole Smith, 27, whose 14-month marriage to a
90-year-old Texas oil baron ended when he died in August, was admitted
to hospital yesterday. Smith had hospital treatment last year for mixing
drugs and alcohol but her publicist denied a television report that she
had taken an overdose, saying she had reacted adversely to prescription
drugs.

Paris
THE French Government, suffering from a record-breaking low in
popularity, was reshuffled yesterday, only six months after its
appointment following Jacques Chirac's election as president in May.
Changes, mainly cosmetic, involved the departure of 12 members of
government and the suppression of nine government posts.
The presidential Elysee Palace announced yesterday that Prime Minister
Alain Juppe had presented his resignation and that of his government to
President Chirac. Mr Juppe was immediately re-appointed as premier and
invited to form a new government.
All senior Ministries remain unchanged, although Elisabeth Hubert lost
her job as Minister of Health and Francoise de Panafieu her post in
charge of tourism.
Four new appointments were announced -- Frank Borotra as Minister for
Industry; Jean-Claude Gaudin, the mayor of Marseilles, was made Minister
for towns; Dominique Perben, Minister for the civil service; and Alain
Lamassoure, Minister for the budget and government spokesman.
Mr Juppe's first government had included 12 women, a record in any
French regime. Eight, however, lost their jobs yesterday.
The reshuffle was seen in Paris as an attempt to regain public support
and mark the recent policy turn-about of President Chirac, who has
placed cutting public spending at the head of his agenda, instead of the
fight against unemployment. However the changes did not, as some had
hoped, open the government to right-wingers outside the RPR Gaullist
Party.
The possibility of a reshuffle had been mooted last month after the
Paris prosecutor decided not to press charges against Mr Juppe regarding
his abusive tenancy of a Paris City Council apartment -- an affair which
greatly damaged the premier's popularity. With the danger of legal
proceedings removed, senior members of the Gaullist party, who elected
Mr Juppe their president on October 15, hoped a reshuffle would impress
public opinion.
The rapid loss of popularity of Mr Juppe's first government was owing
to its failure to realise Mr Chirac's promise to cut unemployment; the
controversial campaign of nuclear tests in the Pacific; failure to put a
rapid stop to the summertime wave of terrorist bomb attacks; and lack of
direction.

Jerusalem
ISRAEL forged ahead with the next stage in Palestinian self-rule today
despite recrimination over who created a climate of hatred that led to
Yitzhak Rabin's assassination.
Israeli and PLO officers met in Jenin to discuss the handover of the
first West Bank town to come under self-rule since Rabin's September
agreement with PLO chief Yasser Arafat.
Keen to reassure the world that Rabin's assassin, law student Yigal
Amir, had not also killed Middle East peace, acting Prime Minister
Shimon Peres told reporters: ''I shall continue the process of peace
that we have started.''
After talks with Prime Minister John Major, one of the many foreign
leaders who thronged Rabin's state funeral yesterday, Peres said the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from West Bank Arab towns and villages
would go ahead on schedule.
The Palestinian Authority's chief military liaison officer,
Brigadier-General Ziad al-Atrash, said: ''We are now resuming the
redeployment. Everything is going according to what had been agreed.
Palestinian police will arrive in Jenin this week.''
Israel also eased the closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip imposed
after Rabin was shot.
Syria, Israel's most powerful remaining Arab adversary, sent
conciliatory signals. The official daily al-Baath urged Peres to
reactivate peace talks and said Rabin's assassination had left the
Middle East with a greater need for peace.
The government said it was preparing to clamp down on extreme-right
incitement to violence and punish incidents of rejoicing over Rabin's
murder.
Four far-rightists were arrested and others went into hiding as it was
reported that more arrests were pending.
A spokeswoman said Justice Minister David Libai planned legal measures
to ban incitement to violence against public figures. Angry Rabin
supporters tore down posters depicting him in Nazi uniform or wearing an
Arafat-style headdress.
With Israel's divisions laid bare, thousands of Israelis continued to
file past Rabin's grave and held candlelight vigils outside his Tel Aviv
home.

Washington
REPORTS reaching Washington suggest that President Boris Yeltsin's
condition is far more serious than the Russian Government has admitted
and that, at the very best, he will not be able to resume his functions
for several months.
President Clinton has offered American medical facilities to perform
surgery on Mr Yeltsin if the Russians choose. That would mean either
heart by-pass or angioplasty. The German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, made a
similar offer. So far, the Kremlin has not responded.
The reports suggest that Mr Yeltsin suffered a serious heart attack,
not the mild one reported from Moscow, just after returning home after
his last visit to New York. He seemed to have aged seriously, and to
walk with difficulty while he was meeting Mr Clinton at President
Franklin Roosevelt's house, Hyde Park, in up-state New York.
Older reporters were reminded of the shock of seeing Georges Pompidou,
the French president, during a summit meeting with President Nixon in
1974. The French Government had consistently denied that he was ill, and
the French press had not reported that the president was, in fact, dying
of cancer.
His condition became public when American reporters observed him
directly. He died later that year.
Mr Yeltsin, too, looked puffy and sick, and the American government
was worried about him even before he fell ill. The White House and State
Department will not admit that they do not expect Mr Yeltsin to remain
in office, but they are certainly preparing for that eventuality.

Washington
ONE American child in four is now born out of wedlock, and single
mothers are becoming older and richer, the US Census Bureau reported
today.
Although the overall US rate of single motherhood had dropped slightly
from 1992, the figures showed a significant increase among affluent,
white, well-educated working women, said Amara Bachu, who wrote the
Census Bureau report.
Bachu, a statistician and demographer, called this phenomenon the
Murphy Brown Syndrome. It is named after a popular television character,
played by Candice Bergen, who chose to become a single mother in her 40s
while working at a high-powered job.
The big boom in out-of-wedlock births was among women in their 30s
whose biological clocks were ticking loudly, said Bachu in an interview.
The total birth rate for US women aged 30 to 34 was 90 per 1000 women
in 1994, the most recent year available, according to the study. That is
a huge increase on the 56.4 rate for similarly aged women in 1976.
For women in their late 30s, there was a comparable increase: from
22.6 births per 1000 in 1976 to 36 per 1000 last year.
Unwed mothers are increasingly those who have already started careers
and have chosen to bear children, Bachu said.
The report showed that 26% of total US births were to single mothers
last year, down from 30% in 1992.
Among black women, 66% of births were to unmarried mothers, but Bachu
said this represented a decrease from previous years.
More teenagers are becoming single mothers as a response to changing
societal forces, Bachu said. She said the stigma of single parenthood is
fading and government programmes enable younger mothers to continue
their educations to give them a better chance of supporting their
children.
Statistics for 1992 show that the 30% rate of US births to unmarried
women was comparable to that in other developed countries, including 29%
in Canada, 33% in France, and 31% in Britain.
The highest rates of out-of-wedlock births were in Sweden, with 50%,
and Denmark, with 46%. The lowest rate was for Japan, with 1%. Italy had
the next lowest with 7%.--Reuter.

Brussels
NATO's 16 ambassadors met today, but failed to break the deadlock
between two leading candidates for the Alliance's top job amid growing
signs of a rift over the issue between Washington and its European
allies.
''The ambassadors do consider more time is necessary and have agreed
to meet again next Friday,'' said one senior Alliance source.
Alliance sources said the United States, Canada, and Turkey had yet to
declare formally for or against former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers
or former Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen.
Alliance diplomats say the dispute reflects the importance Washington
attaches to the post and its irritation with the Europeans for pushing
their candidates too openly when Washington needs Congressional support
to send US troops to Bosnia.
''I do not think they have serious objections, they are just trying to
make a point,'' said a senior Nato diplomat.
Other sources said that, if the issue was not resolved soon,
Washington would be forced to go public with its veto on Lubbers, a move
which would severely test transatlantic solidarity.
Britain and France, the key players in Bosnia where a Nato-led peace
mission is planned to police any settlement, strongly favour Lubbers
over Ellemann-Jensen.
Lubbers is believed to have the support of about 11 European countries
with only Denmark, Iceland, and Norway backing Ellemann-Jensen.
Yesterday, the United States said it was not ready to back frontrunner
Lubbers, proposed last Friday by the Netherlands, and the search for
other candidates should continue.--Reuter.

FROM riding high on the back of their conference and the supposed
boost from the Braveheart movie, the SNP has lost virtually all the
ground gained and Labour has surged back into complete ascendancy in The
Herald's latest System Three poll.
The SNP had halved the gap on Labour to just 16 points in our previous
poll, reaching the psychologically important 30% mark, while Labour
slipped below 50% for the first time this year.
Now Labour has bounced back spectacularly on the back of its own
successful conference season, pushing back to 52% while the SNP has
slumped seven points to 23%.
The results reflected a good month in the polls south of the Border
for Labour and may also point up the successful conclusion of the
Scottish Constitutional Convention's long negotiations over plans for a
parliament in Edinburgh.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ''The Braveheart
bubble has burst for the nationalists. The publicity of the SNP
conference has now completely evaporated and the nationalists are now
polling well below their 1994 average of 26%. Labour, by contrast, are
polling well above their 1994 average of 49%.
''This shows that Scots who really want a bright future for their
country are backing Labour because they know only Labour can get rid of
the Tories. This poll is a massive set-back for the SNP and will set the
alarm bells ringing in their party HQ.
''It also makes depressing reading for the Tories, who haven't
improved at all since their party conference and have still not been
able to break through the psychological barrier of 13%.''
SNP chief executive Michael Russell said: ''Even on these figures, the
gap between the SNP and Labour is narrower than it was during the summer
months, which shows that the trend is towards the SNP.
''Attention has been focused south of the Border recently and the SNP
does best when Scotland is centre stage. We intend to put Scotland's
future at the top of the agenda again with the launch of our budget
proposals next week.
''Labour's support is volatile and certainly not impregnable. There
have now been 48 months of SNP support above 20%. The SNP challenge is
sustained, while other parties are nowhere. People want to support
Scotland and the SNP and we intend to show over the next few months why
such support is now essential.''
Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, said: ''The
Braveheart blitz is clearly over for the SNP. Now we are turning our
attention increasingly to the price that Scots would have to pay for the
devolution plans of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.''
Scottish Liberal Democrat chief executive Andy Myles said they were
holding steady and such polls always underplayed their support. ''These
figures confirm that nationalist support has fallen away after the
publication of the SCC report, as predicted. It suggests that the
Bravehearts are becoming Fainthearts and that you can't sustain a
political campaign on box office returns.''

Washington
THE widow of murdered Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin today
accused the main opposition Likud Party of creating the climate in which
her husband was gunned down.
''Yes, surely I blame them,'' Leah Rabin told an American TV
programme. ''If you ever heard their speeches at the Knesset you would
understand what I mean.
''They were very, very violent in their expressions: 'We are selling
the country down the drain'. 'There will be no Israel after this peace
agreement'. I mean this was wild.''
Mrs Rabin confirmed that she had deliberately cold-shouldered Likud
leader Benjamin Netanyahu when he filed past her after Monday's funeral
on a Jerusalem hillside.
She said she avoided making a scene but was as ''cold as I could be''.
''I would have avoided shaking his hand if I could,'' she added, ''but
he knew. And we both understood that actually we would have loved to
avoid shaking each others' hands.''
Today Netanyahu denied stirring up hatred. He said Rabin had been
killed by a madman from Israel's political lunatic fringe and it was
''cynical incitement'' to blame Likud for the murder.
He said he had genuine, deep differences with Rabin and his
centre-left government on how best to make peace with the Palestinians
but he had never advocated political violence.
He claimed there was ''very cynical incitement going around now trying
to blame part of the country and besmirch half the people'' and said the
government should ban all extremist groups.
However Leah Rabin said her husband's assassin, Yigal Amir, had been
no lunatic.
In an interview with Israel radio she also recalled threats shouted by
mobs promising to kill her and her husband in the Kings of Israel Square
in Tel Aviv, where he was gunned down on Saturday night.
She described how her husband was dogged by Jewish extremists who
would stand outside their house, jeering.
''For weeks and weeks, every week they would come and wait for him and
shout at him 'traitor, murderer','' she said.
''Last Friday, when I got home at 3 o'clock, they said to me 'Just
wait. A year from now, in Kings of Israel Square, we'll kill you both.
There you will be like Mussolini and his mistress. That's the way you
will be.''
* The parents of assassin Yigal Amir tonight apologised to Rabin's
widow and the people of Israel.
In a letter to Mrs Rabin, read on Israeli television, the Amir family
wrote: ''A great disaster has befallen us and all the people of Israel
with the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, may his memory
be blessed, by our son.''
Mrs Rabin said earlier that any apology would be too late.--Reuter/AP.

Kigali
RWANDAN government soldiers killed some 300 former Rwandan troops and
militiamen in an assault on an island near Zaire's border in their
biggest blow to rebel forces, it emerged today.
Officials said amphibious Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA) troops stormed
Iwawa island in Lake Kivu on Saturday night and fought with the Hutu
militants until overrunning the island last night.
''We assaulted the island on Saturday. The fighting went on for two
days because they were heavily dug in and the terrain was in their
favour. They had also booby-trapped many routes on the island,'' said a
spokesman for Rwanda's Defence Ministry.
''Indications so far are that the enemy lost as many as 300 but these
are preliminary figures because we are still counting. Most of these
were killed on the island during the assault. Others were killed trying
to flee the island, others drowned.''
The RPA lost five soldiers killed and some were wounded, he added.
The RPA, dominated by Rwanda's Tutsi minority, seized power in July
last year after the genocide of up to one million Tutsis and Hutu
moderates by Hutu troops, militiamen, and mobs.
Military sources on Iwawa told the Rwandan Press Agency that more than
300 Hutu former government soldiers and militiamen had been killed. One
correspondent had counted a total of 54 bodies on land and 87 in the
water. Fifteen prisoners were reported captured.
The government spokesman said there were between 500 and 600 former
Rwandan troops on the island, by far the biggest enemy concentration RPA
troops had found.
He said heavy machineguns, anti-tank cannons, and anti-aircraft guns,
many brand-new and not yet assembled, were captured on Iwawa, which is
10 miles from the mainland.
Hutu militants have launched hit-and-run raids into Rwanda from the
island in recent months.
UN officials said the RPA was worried by growing cross-border
insurgency mounted by former Hutu troops and militiamen who escaped to
Zaire and Tanzania last year.
In another development, a government soldier shot dead 14 people and
wounded 19 before killing himself in south-western Rwanda.
State radio reported that the soldier opened fire on a mob which was
angry because he had stabbed a resident to death in an argument in a
bar.
NAIROBI: The Red Cross has suspected operations in Burundi after
unknown gunmen ambushed a convoy and killed a Burundian employee. As in
neighbouring Rwanda, violence in the strife-torn country pits the
Tutsi-led army and militia against Hutu guerrillas, with civilians and
refugees caught in the middle.-- Reuter.

Paris
FRANCE'S top anti-terrorist magistrate, Jean-Louis Bruguiere, flew to
London today to co-ordinate moves with British authorities against
suspected Algerian Muslim fundamentalist bombers.
He was to discuss the possible extradition of Abdelkader Benouif,
alias Abou Fares, an Algerian held by Scotland Yard in connection with a
wave of bombings in France.
Meanwhile, France issued an international arrest warrant for Benouif.
The warrant was sent to Interpol for foreign circulation, justice
officials said in Paris.
Another Algerian, arrested with Benouif at the weekend, was released
yesterday and then immediately re-arrested on immigration charges.
The second man is reportedly the brother of Abdelkrim Deneche, an
Algerian resident in Sweden believed by France to be a key figure in the
bombings case but whose extradition Stockholm rejected.
Benouif is suspected of having masterminded a series of bomb attacks
which killed seven people and wounded about 170 in France since July 25.
British police have a further 48 hours to question Benouif. They were
granted a similar extension to question three other suspected members of
Algeria's Armed Islamic Group (GIA) who were picked up at the weekend.
The GIA has claimed responsibility for the bomb attacks.
Police today transferred to a Paris hospital a young Algerian wounded
in a shoot-out with security forces near Lyons last month while
protecting the getaway of Khaled Kelkal, another key suspect who was
killed soon afterwards by gendarmes.
1 Another key suspect, Boualem Bensaid, 27, and five alleged
accomplices were placed under investigation and remanded in custody in
Paris yesterday.--Reuter.

MURDERER Frederick West drew a sketch of a gravestone for himself and
his wife, Rosemary, the court heard yesterday.
It was attached to a letter outlining plans for their burial alongside
their murdered daughter, Heather, their step-daughter, Charmaine, and
Fred's first wife, Rena.
The letter, sketch, and a suicide note were found in his cell at
Winston Green Prison after he hanged himself.
His letter read: ''Well Rose, it is your birthday on November 19,
1994, and you will be 41 and still beautiful and still lovely and I love
you. We will always be in love.
''The most wonderful thing in my life is when I met you how our love
was special to us. So love, keep your promises. You know what they are.
''When we are put together for ever and ever. It is up to you. Lay
Heather by us. We loved Heather. I would love to have Charmaine to be by
Heather with Rena. Well Rose, you will always be Mrs West all over the
world. That is wonderful to me and you.
''I have not got you a present. All I have is my life. I will give it
for you my darling. When you are ready, come to me. I will be waiting
for you.''
The gravestone in the sketch carried the epitaph: ''In loving memory,
Fred West, Rose West. Rest in peace. Where no shadow falls in perfect
peace he waits for Rose his wife.''
His suicide note read: ''To Rose West. Happy New Year Darling. All my
love, Fred West. All my love, for ever and ever.''

ONE-WAY electronic tolling could be introduced on the Forth road
bridge as part of short-term action to ease the growing traffic
congestion pending a decision on the construction of a second road
bridge.
A new collection system is one of a package of measures which the
Scottish Office and Lothian and Fife regional engineers have been asked
to investigate in an attempt to come up with a solution.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, who announced the joint study
yesterday after discussions in London with the conveners of the two
regions, has asked the officials to come up with their detailed
proposals and a timetable for their implementation by February.
Other measures to be considered are the creation of preferential bus
lanes on approaches, park-and-ride facilities, and a scheme to encourage
car-pooling by commuters.
Announcing the move, Mr Forsyth, who was accompanied at the meeting by
Scottish Road and Transport Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, said:
''It is clear that no one measure can solve all the transport problems
of the area and that an integrated package of measures is the best way
of tackling the problem.''
The Forth Road Bridge Joint Board will be told when it meets on Friday
that bridge users will face major delays because of 10-week programme to
carry out repair work on cracking of the road surface.

JUNK mail, the scourge of every householder, finally has a use and is
to be converted into electric wheelchairs for disabled children.
Blue Peter is urging its five million viewers to redirect the glossy
promotional material to its Paperchain Appeal.
It is the long-running programme's 34th Christmas appeal and, along
with the children's charity Whizz-Kidz, it aims to convert 5000 tonnes
into 100 electric wheelchairs over the next three months.
As well as junk mail and office paper, a BBC spokeswoman suggested
cards could also be collected after Christmas. She said magazines and
newspapers are of no use.
The children's programme has a reputation for converting useless items
into hard cash for needy causes.
A BBC spokeswoman said: ''We never ask for money, always unwanted
items. That way any child can make a contribution regardless of how rich
their parents are.''
Contributions towards this year's appeal can be taken to paperbanks at
875 branches of Safeway, Sainsbury, Somerfield, Tesco, and Stewarts and
Crazy Prices in Northern Ireland.
Blue Peter presenter Diane-Louise Jordan said of the appeal: ''It's
great news for the environment and for children with disabilities.''

A LAWYER sought a solution in fraud after his parents had gone from
riches to rags, a court heard yesterday.
William Templeton, 39, milked clients' accounts and put the cash into
accounts under fictitious names.
Later, he claimed that one of the names, Lawrence Beech, had been
picked from a Dick Francis novel.
Police could find no trace of the name in the books but discovered
that there was a Beech Road with Lawrence houses near the accused's
home.
Templeton later said the name belonged to a corporal who had won the
Victoria Cross in the First World War but Army records showed the only
corporal of that name who had won a VC served during the Crimea War and
died in 1870.
Templeton, of Heath Avenue, Lenzie, near Glasgow, admitted embezzling
#11,605 from a Glasgow law firm between November 1988, and April 1990.
Mr Ian Bradley, prosecuting, said the parents of the accused, a
married man with two young children, had got into financial
difficulties.
The father had profited from the sale of Templeton's Dairies some
years ago but had made unsuccessful business ventures.
''From staying in one of the best areas of Lenzie, he was reduced to
staying in rented accommodation and depending on income support,'' he
said.
It was then the accused embarked on his scheme to provide funds to
support both his own and his parents' life-styles.
The accused took money from the accounts of 10 clients and put it in a
building society under the name of Lawrence Beech.
Each week, he withdrew #250 and became so well known to the staff that
they knew his hobby was toy soldiers and playing war games.
Eventually, staff at the law firm became suspicious and an audit
revealed the cash shortage.
Mr Bradley said Templeton appeared before a solicitors' disciplinary
tribunal and was struck off.
Mr Bradley added: ''He was calculating in his deceit.
''This was a protracted and varied series of frauds from clients but
it was doomed to failure by the very slapdash ways in which they were
executed.
''He was a man who, in an excess of loyalty to his parents, failed to
recognise the extent of his own financial obligations and over-committed
himself and at the end of the day resorted to plundering clients'
accounts in order to boost his income.
''There has been no expression of remorse or regret to his partners or
clients. I have the suspicion he may have buried his head in the sand in
the hope it would all go away.''
Defending solicitor Paul Burns asked Sheriff Brian Lockhart to call
for social inquiry, community service, and psychiatric reports before
passing sentence.
He said it was a ''tragic and bizarre'' case of a very sick man who
actually thought he was Larry Beech.
Mr Burns added: ''The overwhelming impression is of a man who was at
the end of his tether, blundering and crashing to disaster.''
Mr Burns pointed out that no member of the public lost out, because
the Solicitors' Guarantee Fund made good their losses.
Sheriff Lockhart deferred sentence for three weeks.

ARTIST David Hockney yesterday backed TV newsreader Julia Somerville
and her boyfriend after their arrest for allegedly taking ''indecent''
bathtime photographs of her seven-year-old daughter.
He said the case was an example of the kind of censorship which was
inhibiting artists in what they can put on show in public.
''I have in my pocket a drawing of a little girl, she must be 12 or 14
and in a very provocative pose with a dog. It is from 1790 and it is
delightful,'' Mr Hockney said at the launch of a major retrospective of
his work at the Royal Academy in London.
He added: ''But if I described it to Scotland Yard, they would be
round straight away.
''There is something wrong there. There is even something wrong at
Boots when you can't get photographs developed.
''People in power don't take art seriously because they are philistine
and are not concerned with beauty or the things I am concerned with.''
He was commenting after architect Jeremy Dixon, 56, and 48-year-old
Miss Somerville were arrested last week when Boots photo lab technician
Sheldon Atkinson reported the bathtime snaps to police.
The couple, who were released on police bail, have said the
photographs were entirely innocent and had been misconstrued.
Mr Hockney did not mention the couple by name.

THE Royal British Legion yesterday claimed overwhelming public support
for its campaign to bring back the two-minute silence on Armistice Day.
A survey of 1000 people carried out by the legion found that 94%
backed its reinstatement.
Highest support at 97% came from people over the ages of 65 but in no
age category did support fall below 90%.
The Prime Minister is leading support for the campaign to restore the
two-minute silence to its traditional time of the 11th hour on the 11th
day of the 11th month, the exact time of the ceasefire that brought the
First World War to an end in 1918.
The Armistice Day commemoration was moved to the second Sunday of
November after the Second World War.

<HEADLINE>Troubled Highland NHS trust 'discovers' an extra #1.7m</HEADLINE>

THE troubled Highland Communities NHS Trust, the chief executive of
which was forced to resign over its projected #1.8m deficit, may be
#1.7m better off than expected.
The trust, which runs 14 small hospitals throughout the Highlands, has
the extra #1.7m because of a revaluation which was carried out on all
NHS properties at the beginning of the year.
On Monday, Mr St John Hattersley was forced to resign as chief
executive after doctors and dentists made it clear they had no
confidence in him.
Ross, Cromarty, and Skye MP Charles Kennedy said last night that he
was determined to establish the trust's true financial position and
would be pressing for an urgent meeting with Scottish Health Minister
Lord James Douglas Hamilton.
Yesterday, the Highland Health Board's director of finance, Mr Malcolm
Iredale, confirmed that the #1.7m did exist.
''They could use it just now to tackle the deficit but it would have
to be paid back at the end of this financial year,'' he said. ''So it
would just be postponing resolution of the problem. They could, however,
use any interest it might earn if it has been invested,'' he said.
If the #1.7m was invested at a 5% return, #85,000 could be raised
within the full year, leaving the capital sum and its interest almost
directly equal to the projected deficit.
However, a Scottish Office spokesman insisted: ''There is no question
of there being #1.7m sitting in a bank account gathering interest. It is
an accounting exercise.
''All NHS properties were revalued at the beginning of the year,
something that happens every five years. The NHS management executive is
currently considering the implication of this revaluation but it will
have no impact on trusts' individual budgets this year.''
Mr Kennedy added: ''From day one of this controversy, I have had
increasing doubts as to the gap between a real financial crisis at local
level and the apparent shortfalls at financial management levels.
''There were always going to be difficulties in grafting an internal
market system on to the Highland situation, where you just don't have
large competing hospitals. There was bound to be artificiality in
accounting transfers. I will be raising these matters with the
Minister.''
Meanwhile, a meeting was held in Inverness yesterday between staff
representatives and the management of the trust. After the meeting, Mr
David Robertson, interim chairman of the joint staff consultative
committee, said: ''It was a very constructive meeting at which we
discussed the trust's recovery plan. We are working in partnership with
trust management for the ultimate benefit of patients.''

<HEADLINE>Golf-club maker Swilken goes into receivership</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975487290</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ONE of the world's leading golf club manufacturers, Swilken of St
Andrews, has gone into receivership.
The company, the largest maker of clubs in the ''home of golf'' for
more than 25 years, produces traditional, custom-made, and specialised
clubs and has enjoyed a worldwide reputation for innovation and
craftsmanship.
Swilken managing director Ian Bunch said: ''Everyone here is very
upset at the decision. Hopefully, it can be sold as a going concern and
we are all working to that end.
''The company will continue to trade on at the moment in the hope that
a buyer can be found.''
Like golf manufacturing companies at home and abroad, Swilken was
badly hit by the recession in the late 1980s and has seen a dramatic
reduction in its workforce from around 40 to seven at its 4000sq ft
factory in Argyle Business Park. Its previous headquarters -- three
times the size of its current base -- was sold to a supermarket company
three years ago.
In 1991, Swilken became the first major golf concern in the United
Kingdom to sell equipment direct from the factory floor to golfers as
part of a trading programme designed to enhance expansion prospects.
The move by the company was aimed at putting Scottish-made clubs in a
better position to compete with those manufactured in the Far East and
the United States.
Last year, Swilken announced major expansion plans into India,
manufacturing and selling their products under licence to the Indian
market, which followed the setting up of retail outlets in Glasgow and
South Korea, and a customising centre in Aberdeen.
Swilken hit the headlines several years ago with the first of a number
of special projects, the manufacture of sets of golf clubs cast in
bronze alloy from the original 32.5-ton propellers from the Queen
Elizabeth II. A further innovation involved the production of a limited
edition set of clubs and putter from the propellers of the royal yacht
Britannia.
Mr Rodney Owen, corporate recovery partner with KPMG at their
Edinburgh offices, who has been appointed as official receiver, said:
''We are looking for a buyer for Swilken. It is hoped to preserve the
business by selling it as a going concern.''
The two principal brand names involved are Swilken and George Nicoll
of Scotland, the latter secured in a deal with the 100-year-old Leven
company when it closed down in 1982.
Swilken was born out of the ashes of Spalding when they pulled out of
St Andrews in the early 1960s for economic reasons.

A STROKE victim, who gave evidence of a pact alleging Frederick West
would take the blame for murders and cover up for his wife, Rosemary,
was taken to hospital from Winchester Crown Court midway through her
testimony yesterday.
Trial judge Mr Justice Mantell told the jury her condition could be
serious.
Mrs Janet Leach, 39, became the confidante of Fred West as he was
interviewed by police last year. He told her that the deaths of young
girls at 25 Cromwell Street were all Rosemary's mistakes.
They were all sexual but were not meant to happen, Mrs Leach told the
jury before becoming ill.
She had been part of a charity organisation scheme to give support to
people being interviewed by police when she was selected to sit with
Fred West last February.
The jury heard she was replaced in May last year when police officers
feared for her health. The following month she suffered a stroke. She
told the jury she had recovered.
However, midway through cross-examination by Mr Richard Ferguson, QC,
defending, the jury was told that Mrs Leach was being taken to hospital.
She had been giving her evidence sitting in the witness box, where she
looked pale and tearful and had been offered water.
Last night, a hospital spokesman said her condition was satisfactory.
She was being detained for observation.
She had been called as a witness by Mr Brian Leveson, QC, prosecuting,
to rebut taped police interviews heard by the court on Friday.
During these, Fred West appeared to assume the blame for the killings
and insisted his wife had not been involved.
In her evidence, Mrs Leach suggested otherwise.
So too did Dr James McMaster, a Scottish medical officer at Winson
Green Prison, Birmingham, where on New Year's Day, Fred West hung
himself in his cell.
Dr McMaster told the court Mr West also told him he had been covering
up for his wife and that Heather West had helped dig a hole in the
garden of 25 Cromwell Street, not knowing it was for her own grave. She
thought she was helping to construct a paddling pool.
Mrs West denies 10 counts of murdering 10 young girls and women
including Heather.
Mrs Leach said Fred West had told her that he was protecting Mrs West
but assured her the truth would come out at trial.
In the first days after his arrest, he was anxious to know whether Mrs
West had been let out. On the night before their arrest, they had come
to a pact whereby he would take the blame for everything.
She saw him for months after his initial arrest and he never changed
the story that he was covering up for his wife.
During their conversations, Mr West told her he was not good at sex
and his wife was very demanding. ''But he would do anything for her,''
she continued.
She was assured time and again that when the matter came to trial Fred
West would reveal the truth of what had happened. ''I really thought he
would,'' Mrs Leach said.
Asked to recap, she described conversations over the death of
Charmaine, Fred West's Scots-born stepdaughter who disappeared aged
eight.
Mrs Leach told the court that Fred West had given two accounts.
Initially, he insisted he was in remand hostel when she disappeared.
Later, he said he had murdered Charmaine's mother Rena and then, having
forgotten Charmaine was in the back of his car, killed her too. She told
the court she asked Mr West which was the true story. He told her he was
in a remand hostel at the time Charmaine disappeared.
Mrs Leach told the court how Fred West described how he, Mrs West, and
another person would pick up young girls who were hitch-hiking and from
bus stops.
During their conversations, he denied that he knew bodies were buried
under the cellar at 25 Cromwell Street. He came back from work one day
and was told by his wife to concrete over the floor.
At other times, he contradicted his story by saying he had helped
dispose of the remains.
It was at this stage he suggested that the deaths were all Rosemary's
mistakes.
Following Fred West's death, Mrs Leach sought advice from lawyers and
eventually spoke to the police about what he had told her.
Asked if Fred West had mentioned bones that were missing from victims,
Mrs Leach said he told her Heather's fingers were taken off so nobody
could identify her. The only other explanation for bones missing from
other bodies from him was: ''It was just the way they chopped them.''
Under cross-examination by Mr Ferguson, the witness agreed that Fred
West had incriminated a number of people in the killings.
When Mrs Leach gave up her duties, Fred West had said to her in front
of a police officer: ''I have told you the truth. You know everything.''
It was at this stage the court adjourned for lunch and Mrs Leach took
ill.
Dr McMaster, also called by the Crown for rebuttal, said in August
last year he had spoken to Fred West after prison staff became concerned
about his mental state. He was depressed.
Fred West told him he was not responsible for the deaths. Dr McMaster
said Fred West insisted it was his wife who was to blame, but was
prepared to cover up for her. At one time, Mrs West had attempted to
murder him with a kitchen knife.
The doctor said that Fred West claimed his wife was burying people
without his knowledge. He did not know there were bodies in the basement
where under her instructions he concreted the floor over.
The doctor said he formed the conclusion that Fred West was not
mentally ill and that he was not at risk of harming himself, a view he
held until a few days before his suicide.

THE Minister of State at the Scottish Office, Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, last night defended changes to the criminal justice
system which have been criticised by the Faculty of Advocates.
The faculty has warned that the 1995 Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act
denies direct access to the Court of Criminal Appeal in Scotland and
could lead to miscarriages of justice.
The faculty also thinks the introduction of a sifting process to weed
out ''hopeless'' appeals may be in breach of the European Convention on
Human Rights.
However, Lord James said the change, which introduced a single judge
sifting process for appeals, was a positive step aimed at cutting out
unmeritorious and frivolous cases and ensuring that the Appeal Court's
time was not wasted unnecessarily. He added that the faculty had been
consulted over the changes.
He said: ''I am somewhat surprised at the reaction coming now from the
Faculty of Advocates to the arrangements which have introduced leave to
appeal procedures in Scotland.
''These provisions have been in the public domain since November last
year. Prior to that, full and detailed consultations were entered into
with a wide range of professionals and public bodies, including the
Faculty of Advocates.''
He added that, should an appellant be refused leave to appeal by a
single judge, he could continue his application before three judges.
''We believe this constitutes a full and fair procedure,'' he said.

A #6.2m factory shopping and leisure centre was given the go-ahead
last night despite opposition from residents who feared traffic chaos.
The development, in the shadow of the historic Five Sisters shale bing
at Westwood, West Lothian, will be Scotland's first factory outlet
centre.
Mr Sandy Watson, managing director of the Watson Group who are
partners in the development with the giant retail group Freeport
Leisure, promised: ''The first cut on the ground will be made in
January. We'll be open for business in July next year.''
Mr Watson pledged 600 new jobs would be created by the Westwood
project, which would attract 300,000 visitors a year and bring #12m into
the local economy annually.
However, local opponents of the scheme feared that the huge levels of
increased traffic would create chaos on the quiet lanes surrounding the
Westwood site.
Local resident Ms Suzanne Livingstone said: ''I am very disappointed
that the councillors did not take the option of waiting to get the full
reports of the traffic impact study.
''Anyone who drives these roads can see the traffic hazards. It is
road safety we are concerned about.''

THE United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Dr William Crowe,
said last night the ''special relationship'' between America and Britain
would continue.
Speaking in Edinburgh in the present series of Lothian Lectures, he
said: ''I am sure we will continue to turn to Britain for help, comfort,
partnership, and mutual support. Whatever we do, we will be working
together with Great Britain.''
Dr Crowe said it was fashionable in some quarters to proclaim the end
of the special relationship but the facts proved otherwise. He saw
evidence on his desk every day of the strength of the bonds between the
two nations.
''We certainly continue to enjoy a vigorous relationship,'' he said.
The ambassador was less optimistic, however, about the continuation of
the US consulate in Edinburgh, which recently survived the threat of
closure because of economies sought by the US State Department.
Answering a question from a member of the audience, he said the
Edinburgh consulate had been reprieved but the prospect of it continuing
indefinitely was not good.
The embassy believed the Edinburgh presence was extremely important
but it had to be borne in mind that the US Government was making
vigorous efforts to save money across the board.
The ambassador said that if the Edinburgh consulate was closed, the
embassy would send people from London to deal with matters in Scotland.
During his lecture, he appealed for understanding of the difficulties
faced by America and Europe in the new era which had emerged after the
end of the Cold War.
Leaders would inevitably make mistakes but this was in the nature of
evolution. There should be more tolerance of differing views and less
criticism, he said.
Dr Crowe was discussing the commitment of the US to working with
Europe to develop a common transatlantic agenda for the next century.
He was appointed Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1994 after a
distinguished naval career between 1946 and 1989, in which he became an
admiral. Between 1985 and 1989, he was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
Since he retired from military service, Dr Crowe has been chairman of
the Foreign Intelligence Board under President Clinton and has served as
director of the Council of Foreign Relations and chairman of the
Washington Institute of Foreign Affairs.

CLEVELAND-BORN author Pat Barker won the prestigious Booker Prize of
#20,000 last night by beating the critics' and bookies' favourite Salman
Rushdie with her Great War novel, The Ghost Road.
Security was tight at the ceremony in London's Guildhall due to the
presence of Mr Rushdie, who is still living in the shadow of an Islamic
death threat for his earlier book The Satanic Verses.
The Ghost Road is the third in a trilogy begun in 1991 and relates the
story of a working-class soldier returning to France at the end of the
war.
Ms Barker's win comes after her second book in the trilogy, The Eye in
the Door, won the Guardian fiction prize in 1993. The mother of two's
first novel, Union Street, set on Teesside, won her 1983 Best of Young
British Novelist.
The judges, chaired by Tory MP George Walden and including the film
critic Adam Mars-Jones and crime writer Ruth Rendell, made their final
choice moments before the literary world gathered to discuss the merits
of the five shortlisted books.
If this year's Booker Prize lacked the controversy surrounding James
Kelman's win last year, it was notable for its shortlist of only five
books and the nomination of two former winners, Rushdie and Brian
Unsworth.
The other shortlisted titles were Every Face I Meet by Justin
Cartwright -- set in a single day in London in 1990 in the last days of
the Thatcher era, The Moor's Last Sigh by Salman Rushdie -- covering a
vast historical canvas from modern India to Moorish Granada, Morality
Play by Barry Unsworth -- a historical novel set in fourteenth-century
England, and The Riders by Australian author Tom Winton -- the story of
a woman who vanishes and her husband and mute daughter's desperate
search for her.

EXCLUSIVE
A ROW has erupted among Strathclyde Labour councillors over a plan to
spend #500,000 to mark the demise of the regional council next April.
A confidential report outlining the commemorative initiatives,
including the establishment of a #250,000 trust to fund an annual award
for public service, caused deep divisions at a private meeting of the
ruling Labour group.
Informed sources indicate that some members ''went ballistic'' over
the spending proposals, which they considered grotesquely ill-advised
given the council's recent struggles to sustain essential services in
the face of Government cutbacks.
One council insider said: ''It was a paper that should never have come
to the group. The fact that it was put before the group at all is very
worrying. It was ill-timed, ill-informed, and the figures involved were
outrageous.''
Another felt it discredited Strathclyde's reputation as a prudent,
caring council, more interested in service delivery to vulnerable
sections of society than in prestige projects and lavish hospitality.
However, it is understood some of the ''old guard'' were quite keen to
give the programme of commemorative projects further consideration and
the matter was referred to the council's hospitality committee.
Among the the suggestions are:
* Preparation of a final report, including anecdotes from councillors
and officials at a cost of between #20,000 and #25,000.
* Commemorative events both for councillors, officials,
representatives of the community, businesses, and others who have given
support to the regional council over the years. These have been costed
at #60,000.
* A substantial commemorative gift, or gifts, costing #150,000 to
recognise the contribution made by all staff over the years to serving
the community of Strathclyde.
What is envisaged is a major item of equipment which would be given to
a public or charitable body and which would be of benefit to the
inhabitants of Strathclyde.
* The establishment of a #250,000 trust fund which would provide an
annual endowment to be used for the benefit of the inhabitants of
Strathclyde. This would enable annual awards to be made in areas of
public research or service provisions.
The report is described as a brief summary of items discussed which in
total might require a sum of up to #500,000 to implement fully.
Finance chairman, Councillor John Mullin, explained: ''What came up at
the meeting were suggestions about how it should be done and the group
asked for some more information and that's what we're now doing. But no
decision has been made as to how we should commemorate the event or how
much money we should spend.''

A SMALL Victorian building in an Ayrshire village yesterday became the
focus of media attention.
The rural community of Gateside, near Beith, was visited by a
succession of camera crews, reporters, and photographers, all seeking
the primary school.
The reason for the fuss is that some parents have organised a petition
requesting a ballot on whether the school should become self-governing.
If the ballot produces a ''yes'' vote, Gateside may become only the
third school in Scotland to opt out of local authority control.
In this instance, there is added interest because the 51-signature
petition did not come from the school board.
Indeed, it was presented to the board's clerk only last week and had
never been discussed by the board members until a routine meeting on
Monday night when, because the document carried enough names, they had
no choice but to forward the ballot request to the appropriate
authorities and begin the necessary procedures.
The self-governing option is something of a political hot potato
because of a combination of the Government's fervent desire to encourage
schools to opt out, the almost total lack of response among Scottish
parents so far, and the fact that most local authorities are Labour run.
However, organisers of the Gateside petition insist there is no
political motive for the ballot request. They say they simply want to
ensure the school remains open after local government reorganisation
next April, when the new North Ayrshire council takes over from
Strathclyde region.
The school did appear to be under threat about 18 months ago when the
regional council carried out a consultation exercise on a proposal to
close it and move the pupils to nearby Beith primary. The closure plan
was dropped but many parents remain fearful for the school's future.
One parent said: ''When the North Ayrshire authority comes along, it
can say that it will no longer keep this school open. We are not saying
that it will but given that press reports are suggesting that a number
of small schools will close, this school may or may not be a possible
closure.
''The parents are signing this now because, once a local authority
decides to close a school, it is too late to apply for opting-out.''
He agreed that, setting aside closure fears, most people in Gateside
would prefer to keep the school in local-authority control.
The school which has brought the controversial opting-out policy back
under the spotlight dates from the 1890s and consists of three
classrooms. There are 66 pupils, a teaching staff of five (two of whom
are part-time), and a secretary and a janitor.
The facilities are not ideal. For dining and for PE classes, the
pupils have to go to the village hall further up the main street.
Headteacher Mrs Agnes McGuigan said that as a group of parents had
petitioned the school board, a ballot would go ahead in accordance with
legislation. The board would call a meeting of parents to explain the
implications of becoming a self-governing school.
She admitted that the staff were ''quite concerned'' about opting out.
''We really don't know enough about it. Things have happened so quickly
that we have not had a chance to look into it,'' she said.
The board is expected to call a public meeting for parents towards the
end of this month. Chairwoman Mrs Helen Smith said board members had
raised some ''general worries'' about opting out when they had met
earlier this week. However, she added: ''We feel it is our duty to
obtain as much information as possible for parents so that they can make
an informed decision.''
It is understood that the driving force behind the petition is Mr
David Bates, a financial adviser who moved to the area about a year ago.
Yesterday, he declined to comment, saying only: ''It is in the hands of
the school board now.''
He has been reported as saying that his concern is solely to ensure
the school remains open.
A spokeswoman for Strathclyde region said: ''Legally, the ballot must
go ahead. In the run-up to that, the region will be taking the
opportunity to put its case to parents on why the school should stay
within local-authority control.''
Local Labour MP Brian Wilson said: ''I am hopeful that once the
arguments are heard, the majority of parents in Gateside will recognise
that the local authority framework offers the most secure guarantee of
the school's future.''
Now that opting out has been activated, the school board must hold a
ballot organised by the Electoral Reform Society within three months.
The ballot could be completed before then and, based on legislative
requirements, Gateside could open for the new session next August as a
self-governing school, provided the majority of parents cast a ''yes''
vote and the Secretary of State approves.
Mr John Travers, North Ayrshire's director of education, said the best
interests of parents and pupils would be best served by remaining within
a local-authority structure.
''We will be very disappointed if any school opts out. No contact has
been made with the council about Gateside but we would welcome any
opportunity to discuss any concerns parents may have.''

THE convener of the new High-
land Council yesterday called for an independent commission to be set
up to look at how local government is financed.
Councillor Peter Peacock, who is also vice-president of Cosla, said an
review of the existing system was needed urgently. The call was made at
a time when the relationship between councils and the Scottish Office is
said to be at its lowest ebb over funding.
''Local democracy is being eroded by the vice-like grip the Government
has on local government finances, controlling 85% of spending,'' said
the independent council leader. He predicted cash-drained councils had
''no more rabbits to pull from the hat'' to contain council tax rises.
The call immediately prompted strong support from Scotland's
opposition parties.
Labour's local government spokesman, Mr John McAllion, said: ''It
would be a very welcome inquiry. If Michael Forsyth has nothing to fear,
I do not see any reason why he does not agree.''
The SNP's vice-convener for local government, Councillor Maureen Watt,
said: ''An independent inquiry would help to establish the best way of
ensuring secure and stable financing for local government.''
Councillor Donald Gorrie, for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said:
''The present state of affairs is clearly intolerable with the
Government squeezing local councils and then blaming them when cuts have
to be made.''
Mr Peacock said the commission -- drawn from politicians with local
and national government experience working with academic and business
representatives -- would examine issues such as the council tax, the
balance between central and local taxes to support council spending and
look at systems which would give authorities control of a greater share
of their incomes.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said: ''Obviously the Scottish
Office will want to study Councillor Peacock's remarks but the
Government has no plans for another review of local government finance,
given that it is only three years since the council tax was
introduced.''

THE new general secretary elect of Britain's largest trade union,
Unison, yesterday turned down a #9000 a year pay increase and warned
Labour leader Tony Blair he would not be in his or anybody else's
pocket.
Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, 50, polled almost half the votes in a ballot
of the union's 1.4 million members and will move up from his present
role of associate general secretary to succeed general secretary Alan
Jinkinson when he retires next February.
Mr Bickerstaffe polled 151,893 votes, almost 60,000 more than his
nearest rival, Mr Peter Hunter, a right-wing union official from Lytham
St Anne's, who polled 93,402 votes. Knowsley branch secretary Roger
Bannister came third with 58,052 votes and Newcastle nurse Yunus Bashkh
was fourth with 15,139 votes. The turnout was 22.9%.
Mr Bickerstaffe has battled hard against members' low pay and ''fat
cat'' employers and said he hoped to forego the #64,000 general
secretary's salary and remain on his present rate of #55,236. It remains
to be seen whether the union's staffing committee will agree.
He will be the first elected general secretary of Unison, which was
created two years ago through the amalgamation of Nalgo, Nupe, and
Cohse.
The man who was a thorn in Tony Blair's side at Labour's special
Clause Four conference earlier this year has therefore become the most
influential union leader in the land and could remain so for 15 years.
Yesterday, he tried to play down potential difficulties between his
traditional Labour views and Tony Blair's New Labour vision by descibing
his links with the party as ''new and developing'' and said his
relationship with party leader Tony Blair was ''warm''.
Unison did not want any ''fisticuffs'' with Labour, said Mr
Bickerstaffe, adding: ''We have made it clear we are not in the pocket
of the Labour Party -- we are an independent trade union and we will
continue to press those causes we believe in best, including a national
minimum wage.''
He also predicted potential problems over next year's local government
pay award following a warning from employers that any wage rise will
have to be paid for by job losses.
''Downward pressure on public services means we have a lot of problems
with job security. I just hope we get a sufficiently good offer --
no-one looks for industrial action,'' he added.
The son of a Doncaster school caretaker and a nurse, Mr Bickerstaffe
was educated in his native Doncaster and then at Newcastle Polytechnic,
where he gained an honours degree in sociology.
He joined Nupe as a Yorkshire area officer in 1966 before working his
way up to divisional officer for the North East division of Nupe in
1975. Two years later, he was appointed a national officer in charge of
Nupe's 450,000 local government workers and subsquently received much of
the blame for their part in the 1979 ''winter of discontent'', when a
rash of pay disputes in protest at the Labour Government's pay policy
helped to usher in the Thatcher years.
However, it was not until he was installed as Nupe general secretary
in 1982 that the Buddy Holly lookalike started to receive national
attention and he was soon recognised as one of the trade-union
movement's foremost orators.
One of his best recent speeches was to the special Labour Party
conference in April of this year when, against his own inclination but
in line with Unison policy, he put up a very firm defence of the party's
former Clause Four.

THEY steamed out in style from Rosyth for the last time yesterday, the
little warships which have patrolled Scotland's waters and sailed around
the world.
They left in silence. Plans to signal their farewell with a 15-gun
salute had to be abandoned due to technical problems with a ceremonial
gun.
The fishery protection and minesweeping ships sailed from the base,
marking the end of an era. With the closure of Rosyth, they left for new
ports at Faslane on the Clyde, and Portsmouth.
From the bridge of HMS Bicester, brought from Portsmouth for the
occasion, the Flag Officer for Scotland, Northern England, and Northern
Ireland, Vice Admiral Christopher Morgan, saluted them as they sailed in
line.
Rosyth had served as a naval base since the turn of the century and
has been involved in every major conflict since then.
Yesterday, the vice admiral said: ''Today marks the end of an era
which saw its genesis in 1903, when the Government decided to create on
a green-field site, a great northern base to counter the ever-increasing
strength of the German fleet.''
He unveiled a plaque in tribute to the workforce, both civilian and
uniformed, admitting that it was a day of ''great sadness and
nostalgia'' for the Royal Navy to be leaving Rosyth.
Although many naval personnel filed through the gates for the last
time yesterday, the base will not close officially until next March.
Several hundred people lined a corner of the dockyard to watch the
ships sailing under the Forth bridges yesterday.
Off to other horizons were the ships of the First Countermeasures
Squadron, the Hunt- class ships HMS Berkeley, Chiddingfold, Dulverton,
Middleton, Ledbury, and Quorn, with the fishery protection vessels,
Alderney, Guernsey, Lindisfarne, and Orkney.
They are moving to Portsmouth, while HMS Bridport, Cromer, Inverness,
and Walney will move to Faslane.
The first of the Rosyth ships are due to arrive in Portsmouth on
November 11, while the others will berth at Faslane three days later.
Following the decision by the Ministry of Defence to leave Rosyth, a
flood of protests emerged from opposition political parties, Fife
Regional Council, Dunfermline District Council, and naval base unions.
Scottish Liberal Democrat defence spokesman and Fife MP, Mr Menzies
Campbell, stated: ''This is a sad day for the Royal Navy and for Rosyth.
The effective closure of the base brings to an end a long and
distinguished history but more significantly, takes away, probably
irretrievably, an important capability for the Royal Navy.
''The flexibility which a base on the east coast of Scotland gives,
has been removed. We may bitterly regret the absence of Rosyth on a
future occasion.''
Last night, Industry Minister at the Scottish Office, Mr George Kynoch
agreed that the ending of the association between the Rosyth community
and the Royal Navy was the end of an era.
Referring to the decision to award the base site to a consortium of
Scottish companies, he added, however: ''The closure of the naval base
opens up new opportunities for economic development and for the
replacement of lost jobs.''

UNRESERVED apologies and five-figure sums have gone to the Scots-born
bowlers who contested this year's world indoor singles final.
In a letter published by Club Bowler, an English freesheet, they had
been accused of fixing the result of the match.
Last night, beaten finalist and Commonwealth Games gold medallist
Richard Corsie said: ''We have settled out of court but I am still
unhappy. Even after being cleared, it is difficult to know if mud does
not stick.''
The letter, from ''D Spencer, Scarborough'', was printed in March,
within weeks of the launch of the Tunbridge Wells-based magazine,
published by Phoenix Publication.
Glasgow lawyer Martin Smith, who represented Corsie and opponent
Andrew Thomson, said: ''It was an appalling defamation, without
foundation, against two people who are the top sportsmen in their field.
They had to fight for their names and this they have done.''
Publishing director Kara Hickmott yesterday passed all enquiries to
editor Alan Talbot. He said the accusation that the match was fixed was
''unfortunate and indefensible'', then referred to the printed apology.
The latest edition reads: ''We unreservedly accept that this
suggestion is completely untrue and that there exists no basis for it
whatsoever. We sincerely apologise to these two highly respected bowls
players for the natural distress publication of the letter caused them
and for the injury to their reputations.
''We have paid a substantial sum by way of compensation to Thomson and
Corsie, together with their legal costs. Everyone at the magazine
profoundly regrets the publication of this letter.''
Corsie, 28, of Edinburgh -- world singles runner-up to Thomson in the
past two years -- said he was furious when he saw the original letter
headed Why No Stewards' Inquiry? in Club Bowler.
The current world indoor and outdoor pairs champion added: ''I can
hope only that the settlement will now stop any tongues-in-cheek within
bowling circles. It was very disappointing but I will put it behind
me.''
It is understood the magazine's London-based printers met the
out-of-court settlement, although the High Court action had also named
Ms Hickmott and Phoenix.
Scots-born Thomson, 38, who lives in London and is an English bowling
internationalist, was beaten by Corsie in the Irish Masters last week.
He was not available for comment.
Thomson, defending world champion, beat Corsie in straight sets in the
Churchill Insurance World Indoor Bowls Championship final in Preston in
February. It was a bitter disappointment for Corsie, who had dominated
the opening 13 days.

A NEW-born baby found on a doorstep in Coupar Angus was last night
''doing well'' in Ninewells Hospital, Dundee..
The day-old boy, called Angus by nurses, was lucky to be alive,
according to Chief Inspector Ian Watson of Tayside Police.
The baby's teenage mother was later traced and was receiving medical
treatment. A report is expected to be submitted to the procurator-fiscal
at Perth.
Chief Inspector Watson said the baby was found naked on a towel. ''The
baby was discovered at 8.20am and we do not believe that it had been
there all night,'' he said. ''He was cold when he was found but he has
made a full recovery.
''It was very lucky that there was no rain and it was not as cold as it
has been recently.''
Ms Christine Ewen, 26, of Kings Road, Coupar Angus, described how she
found the infant. ''I saw a stray cat raking at something,'' she said.
''I expected to find a dead bird or something, certainly not a new-born
baby.
''It was very lucky that I spotted him when I did. He was very cold
when I picked him up. We brought him in and put a blanket around him.
''Once I picked him up, he started crying and I knew that he was OK.
It wasn't until things settled down that I thought he might have died.
I'm just so glad that we were able to save him.''
Dr Stewart Forsyth, of Ninewells Hospital, said: ''The baby had been
bathed and the cord had been cut. It looks like a full-term baby. He
weighs 6lb 14oz. He had been outside for just a short period of time.
There were no signs of long-term hypothermia and he responded well to
rewarming.''

EVEREST heroine Alison Hargreaves was about to divorce her 48-year-old
husband, an American journalist claimed in an article published
yesterday.
Ms Hargeaves, 33, became the first woman to climb unaided to the
summit of the world's highest mountain last May. She perished three
months later as she descended 28,259ft K2.
Her mother, Mrs Joyce Hargreaves said at her home in Belper,
Derbyshire, last night that she and her husband John had known of
''problems with the marriage and we had talked it over with Alison''.
She added: ''But, for the sake of the children, we do not want to
discuss this further.''
Last night, her husband, Mr Jim Ballard, was on his way by
sleeper-train from Fort William to receive a Person of the Year award
from the Princess Royal on behalf of his late wife at a lunch at
London's Hilton Hotel.
He said: ''I just do not want to say anything about this at all. My
reaction is strictly 'no comment'.''
The claim is made by journalist and international climber Alison
Osius, senior editor of the US magazine Climbing.
She spent three days with Ms Hargreaves in England last autumn after
she had narrowly failed to reach the summit of Everest, eight months
before her successful solo ascent without additional oxygen.
She states: ''Last autumn, she (Alison Hargreaves) offered, on the
record, that she was seeking an amicable divorce.''
She then quotes Ms Hargreaves as saying: ''We've just sort of grown
apart.
''We have totally different opinions. There's no animosity at all. I
want to change things. I've got an awful lot of years left.''
Ms Hargreaves, a mother of two, is the first person to be awarded a
posthumous award at the London ceremony.
The citation states that the award is being presented to Mr Ballard
''in recognition of Alison's bravery and courage in becoming the first
woman to conquer Mount Everest and K2 without oxygen''.
It adds: ''She was one of Britain's most successful mountaineers who
was on the second part of her quest to scale the world's highest three
peaks . . . Everest, K2, and Kanchenjunga . . . when she was killed
whilst descending K2 in August.''
The award ceremony will be chaired by Mr John Birt, director-general
of the BBC, and citations will be read by ITN newscaster Trevor
McDonald.
Last night, Alison Osius said from Carbondale, near Denver, Colorado:
''This was information given to me on the record.
''But, at the time, I did not realise how significant it was. I
respected and admired Alison Hargreaves. I looked on her as a friend and
I was totally devastated by her death.''
She added: ''It was just the case of a marriage that wasn't working
any more . . . that is hardly unusual these days.''
The journalist is understood to have been offered a large sum for the
''divorce'' story but refused and devoted only a few lines of her
13-page article to the topic.
Mr Ballard recently took the couple's children, Tom, six, and Kate,
four, on a poignant pilgrimage to K2 in the Karakoram range in northern
Pakistan -- ''mummy's last mountain'' to them.
Mr Ballard works part-time at the Nevis Range Ski Centre on 4000ft
Aonach Mor, near Fort William, where Ms Hargreaves did her training for
her Himalayan ascents.
She died with six other climbers in the one of the worst post-war
disasters in Himalayan climbing history.
It was her wish that her body remain on the mountain in the event of
her death.
The recovery of her body from above 26,000ft also would be a highly
dangerous exercise.
The highest altitude that the Pakistan Air Force's LLAMA can fly is
19,000ft.
The couple had been married for seven years but had been partners
since Ms Hargreaves was 18.

CHILDREN are to undergo heart surgery at the HCI private hospital in
Clydebank from early next year. A six-bed paediatric wing and a
paediatric intensive therapy unit, with up to three beds, is under
construction and expected to be finished and equipped by January.
A paediatric cardiac surgeon and a specialist anaesthetist have been
appointed. Both are Italian.
The hospital has also gone international in its search for specialist
nurses. Nursing director Christine Fitzgerald said yesterday: ''There
are not enough in Glasgow to go round. We are interviewing nurses from
London, France, Australia, and Ireland. We are also prepared to help
with the training and bridging courses for general nurses.''
HCI, now owned by the Abu Dhabi Investment Company after going into
receivership a year ago, has flown in about 16 children referred from
abroad, mainly for heart surgery, who were then treated at the Royal
Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow under an informal arrangement.
However, some of the hospital's overseas referral bases have become
more specific about the patients sent to HCI being treated there, and
they resolved in the summer to do the work in-house.
Ms Fitzgerald admitted there could be occasions when they might have
to call on the NHS for assistance -- if, for example, something
unexpected went wrong during an operation.

<HEADLINE>Wilson leaves his papers to the nation</HEADLINE>

LORD Wilson of Rievaulx's papers are to be kept as part of the
national heritage, in accordance with his wishes, and made available for
research, it was announced yesterday, alongside publication of his will.
The former Labour Prime Minister also left estate valued at #490,992
gross.
He left ''his political papers, correspondence, speeches and
memoranda, and all rights therein'' to Baroness Falkender, his Downing
Street adviser, aide, and confidante, as his literary executrix.
Goodman Derrick, the solicitors dealing with the estate, said: ''The
intention was that Lady Falkender as literary executrix would give
effect to Lord Wilson's wish that the papers should be kept as part of
the national heritage and be made available for research.
''In the event, arrangements were made during Lord Wilson's life and
all the papers were given to a charitable trust which is in the process
of transferring them to the Bodleian Library to join the state papers
which are already in the possession of the library.''
Mr Joe Haines, who was Harold Wilson's press secretary at 10 Downing
Street, said yesterday: ''They are not in the class of the Churchill
papers, which were bought for #13m.
''They will have some value because they cover the period from 1945 to
1976, which is a major period of our life. But I don't know of anything
particularly explosive in them.
''He kept his papers but he was an untidy man and whether Marcia (Lady
Falkender) kept the papers fully I don't know.''
Mr Haines said: ''If I was to put a value on them, it would be half a
million but that would be a very wild guess.''
Lord Wilson left estate valued at #490,992 gross (net the same).
Probate has been granted to his wife Baroness Wilson and their sons
Robin and Giles.
The former premier died on May 23 this year, aged 79, after a long
illness.
Meanwhile, cartoonist Carl Giles, who died in August, aged 78, left
his #1m collection of work to friends in the hope that it would be
exhibited in a top gallery, his will showed yesterday.
Giles, who was famous for his Daily Express cartoons of Grandma and
her family, preserved his work over 50 years in a barn at his home in
Witnesham, Ipswich, Suffolk.
The collection includes 6000 cartoons along with drawings.
Giles left estate valued at #1,316,455 gross (#1,291,022 net).
He gave his work, personal archives, reference library, studio
equipment, royalties, and #150,000 to his friend Mr Brian Nicholson and
his fellow ''cartoon trustees'' for the creation of a ''charitable fund
in perpetuity for the advancement of education''.
The will states: ''I have particularly in mind the possibility of an
institution such as the Victoria and Albert Museum or the Tate Gallery
accepting some or all of my works and the other objects and putting some
of them on display and the rest in an archive where they can be
inspected.''
Mr Giles' wife Joan died last year. They had no children.

GLASGOW Hillhead MP George Galloway looks likely to win his selection
battle for the new Kelvin seat after being nominated by party members at
a third and final branch meeting in Glasgow last night.
The Labour MP was selected by 30 votes to 17 by the
Scotstoun/Broomhill branch after winning the Anderston/City vote on
Tuesday. His challenger, lawyer Shiona Waldron, was nominated by the
constituency's Hyndland/Hillhead branch after being put forward by the
women's section of the redrawn constituency party.
However, there has been dispute over the two-thirds margin the MP
needed to avoid a full ballot on the grounds that the vote of affiliated
organisations should be taken into account.

<HEADLINE>Barker's Ghost Road spotlights nightmare of grandfather's war</HEADLINE>

PAT Barker, who won the #20,000 Booker Prize last night, based her
novel, The Ghost Road, on her grandfather who fought in the First World
War and remained haunted by it.
She was second favourite with the bookmakers, behind Salman Rushdie
for The Moor's Last Sigh, but first with the judges at London's
Guildhall.
Mother-of-two Ms Barker, 52, lives in Durham and began writing her
trilogy about the First World War in 1991 with the book Regeneration.
The second book, The Eye in the Door, was published in 1993 and won
the Guardian fiction prize. The Ghost Road appeared this year, to
critical acclaim.
Ms Barker was born in Thornaby-on-Tees, Cleveland, and was raised
mainly by her grandparents.
Her grandfather, who had fought in the First World War, became more
and more haunted by it towards the end of his life. He gave her the
inspiration for the books of that period.
She suffered a string of rejections before her first novel, Union
Street, was published in 1982. It won her the 1983 Best of Young British
Novelists award and later was made into the film Stanley and Iris,
starring Jane Fonda and Robert de Niro.
Security was tight last night because of the presence of Rushdie, who
is still under an Islamic death threat for his earlier work, The Satanic
Verses.
The judges, who deliberated until moments before the 27th annual
ceremony began, were chaired by Tory MP George Walden and included film
critic Adam Mars-Jones, literary critic Kate Kellaway, journalist Peter
Kemp, and thriller writer Ruth Rendell.
The Barker trilogy is set in 1918 and tells the story of Lieutenant
Billy Prior returning to France at the end of the First World War after
having been treated for shell shock.
There, he meets up with Wilfrid Owen and realises that there is
nothing the war can do to surprise him and he subsequently survives a
series of horrific battles and illnesses.
She said her trilogy about the war and the effects of shellshock were
triggered by memories of her grandfather in County Durham.
Her next project would be more contemporary, although she had no
desire to write another novel which would become a Hollywood movie.
When the nominations were being announced by Sir Michael Caine,
chairman of the management committee of the awards, she was nowhere to
be seen when her name was called first.
A voice from the audience of more than 1500 shouted out: ''She's in
the ladies.''
Sir Michael said: ''She has obviously made a move as nature demands.''
She later returned to receive her nomination.
