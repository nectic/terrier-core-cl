PROBLEMS with local authority funding of Community Care have caused
difficulties for many private nursing home operators seeking to fill their
homes. Ashbourne is no exception despite the fact that it concentrates on the
top end of the market.
Typically, it charges around #50 more than rival competitors, equivalent to
about #350 per week for a single room. Recently, there have been signs of
stability returning to the market. In any case, demographic trends suggest a
need for the industry to provide an extra 50,000 beds by the end of the decade.
Last year, Ashbourne's occupancy level slipped to 82% from 86%. Chief executive
Tom Hamilton said he was ``quite pleased'' given the toughness of the market.
However, he sees scope to increase the overall occupancy level to 90%.
Oversupply in certain geographic areas, particularly north-west England,
dragged down the overall occupancy level.
Part of the drop in occupancy level was down to the opening of three new homes
and the commencement of developments on a further six sites in south-east
England at a cost of #14m. In addition, four purpose built homes were acquired
during the year for #8m. It takes about a year before a home is mature and
fully contributing to the profit and loss account.
In the 52 weeks to October 1, Ashbourne increased profits from #1.2m to #6.5m,
helped by a sharp fall in interest payments following last year's market
flotation. Year-end gearing was 23% and is expected to rise to around 45% by
the end of next year.
The company has a strong balance sheet as a result of the #50m raised at the
time of flotation. There is a final dividend of 2.2p net. For the full year,
City analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of #7m to #7.3m as contributions
roll in from new homes.
South-east England is the focus of Ashbourne's expansion plan given the
relatively low bed density in that part of the UK. However, that does not
preclude openings elsewhere. Indeed, the group has recently received planning
permission to open a third home in Edinburgh.
Mr Hamilton is confident that for the foreseeable future 10 new homes can be
opened a year without any strain on existing managerial capacity. The group is
looking into the possibility of lease financing future development.
The 20% stake held by Sun Healthcare of the US provides some speculative
interest. Andrew Turner, chairman and chief executive of Sun Healthcare, has
joined Asbourne's board.
Some analysts believe that Sun will eventually want to consolidate the holding
with its Exceler UK nursing homes acquired last year. Ashbourne shares are
likely to remain underpinned by bid speculation.
Yesterday, the shares gained 1p to 140p.

<HEADLINE>Ashdown tells of knife attack</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LIBERAL Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown yesterday described how a knife was held
to his throat as he walked the streets of Yeovil, Somerset.
Mr Ashdown, a former marine commando, brushed off suggestions that his military
background had been any advantage in fighting off his attacker.
``I should think my military training was about as relevant as the Rev Mark
Ellis's training in the Church of England,'' he said, referring to the local
minister who was present when the attack took place.
The incident happened as the Liberal Democrat leader walked around the town
centre at 11.30pm on Sunday night.
``Suddenly we were ap-proached and accosted by a group of three youths in their
early twenties.
``There was a good deal of taunting and abuse.''
The youths were joined by an older man who was drunk.
``I said to him, `Would you like to come for a walk with me?', so we went for a
walk together through the streets. He kept on saying to me he wanted to stop. I
hoped I would be able to get him a bit more sober.
``Quite suddenly, he turned very aggressive and tried to knee me in the groin.
He was very drunk, so I saw it coming, and I moved out of the way, taking the
blow just on my inside left thigh.
``Then he pulled a flick knife out of his pocket and opened it.''
Mr Ashdown said the knife was held at the left side of his throat.
``That I decided was just a little bit too far so I pushed it away rather
forcibly.''
The police arrived and took a man into custody.
``Frankly, if it was not for the knife, it was the kind of incident that
happens in towns like Yeovil up and down the country which police have to cope
with.''
Mr Ashdown had launched a local initiative to combat racist attacks before
going on his tour of the area.
He escaped Sunday's incident shaken but unscathed.
q  A 51-year-old man was remanded in custody for eight days by magistrates at
Yeovil yesterday on two charges in connection with alleged offences involving
Mr Ashdown. He was accused of possessing an offensive weapon, a knife, and with
threatening unlawful violence.

AN 18-year-old soldier was found dead with a single bullet wound to her head
near an Army base yesterday.
Private Cheryl James was discovered lying in woodland about 90ft outside the
garrison in Deepcut, Surrey, where she was on patrol. Her rifle was lying
beside her.
Police said they were not looking for anyone in connection with her death.
Private James, from Llangollen, Clwyd, was a member of the Royal Logistics
Corps.
She had been serving at the garrison since joining the Army in July and was
single.
A joint investigation by Surrey police and the Royal Military Police was
launched after her body was found.
An Army spokesman said a post-mortem examination would be carried out today.
The incident happened five months after a 20-year-old guard shot himself dead
at the barracks.
Private Sean Benton, of Hastings, East Sussex, killed himself hours after being
told he was being discharged from the Army.
An inquest heard that he could not cope with the shame of being ordered out of
the Army.
An Army spokesman said there was no connection between that incident and
Private James's death.

IF you're starting to feel the first pangs of Christmas fatigue, give yourself
a relaxing and refreshing break from the festive flurry with a seaweed body
mask treatment from one of the city's newest therapy centres. It will only mean
stealing a couple of hours from your schedule, and will work wonders for your
feelgood factor.
Thalossotherapy, derived from the Greek word thalassa, meaning sea, is one of
the treatments on offer at the McAlpine Centre, in McAlpine Street, Glasgow.
After an intense and invigorating body scrub, which is intended to promote cell
renewal, a body mask rich in algae, minerals, vitamins, amino acids and trace
elements is applied. Special thermal bandages fix it firmly round the body, and
while you lie down and relax for an hour, the treatment takes effect.
These sea-based preparations are a development of the Victorians' belief in the
beneficial properties of hot and cold baths of sea water baths.
The centre offers several different treatments, largely based on a holistic
approach to problems. Massage is used to relieve stiffness and soreness and to
dispel tension along with aromatherapy, which uses the restorative powers of
oils from plants, flowers and seeds. In this way, anxiety, migraine and stress
problems can be tackled, and some skin conditions, such as eczema, can be
relieved.
And if you really want the pay-off without the pain, try Eurowave, a
computerised slimming and cellulite treatment. This programme, says the
McAlpine, is based on the use of faradic current to work out the muscle and
give the effect of isometric exercise, but without the effort and in a fraction
of the time. Eurowave programmes for treating sports injuries, stress, PMT and
fluid retention are available.
So at this time of the year, don't ignore the one person who probably needs a
Christmas present more than most - you. And it will help you get into shape for
the season.

<HEADLINE>Parkhead club are hot on the trail of Aberdeen strike. Booth at the top of Celtic's wanted list</HEADLINE>

ABERDEEN tasted success with their Coca-Cola Cup victory over Dundee on Sunday,
and yesterday they found themselves facing the first predatory raid on their
young players.
There is little doubt that Celtic would like to add striker Scott Booth to
their squad, but I understand that Celtic manager Tommy Burns has made no bid
for the Scottish internationalist.
He has, however, asked Aberdeen if Booth would be available for transfer and
appears to have been told to wait until after the cup final before renewing
interest.
Celtic need a striker and I believe that Burns has now been given the promised
cash to buy one, or even two, players.
There is close to #3m in the Parkhead kitty at present and Burns will be
allowed that amount to spend in a bid to win the premier division title.
Booth has replaced John McGinlay as the preferred target after Bolton Wanderers
decided that they could not do without the Scottish striker as they fight to
stave off relegation.
At the moment Booth - likened to Gary Lineker by Scotland manager Craig Brown
because of his regular scoring rate with the national side - still has 18
months of his contract to run.
However, Aberdeen do have other strikers and if they have not rejected Celtic's
interest out of hand it suggests that their manager, Roy Aitken, may be keeping
his options open.
If he was to sell Booth and collect in the region of #2m then he would be free
to spend that sum plus other money promised to him by chairman Ian Donald.
He could also argue that he won the trophy without Booth with both goals coming
from the strikers used on the day, Billy Dodds and Duncan Shearer.
It is a situation which Aitken must look at, and consider, even although he
tried to dismiss any transfer speculation yesterday.
He has been told by his directors that he can go out and spend money on players
he may want.
But, as always, there are limitations on the amount he can splash out. However,
if he was to sell shrewdly, then that money could be added to the cash he
already has available.
That was the way Alex Ferguson took the club to their glory years, selling
Steve Archibald to Spurs for #900,000 to give financial stability then
producing a side which brought more glory to Pittodrie than any other.
Yesterday, Aitken insisted that he would spend again and Donald announced that
all the money from the cup success - around #500,000 - plus the residue of the
share issue money was there for the manager to bring in new players.
Said Donald: ``We have cleared the #2.5m debt we incurred over the rebuilding
of the stadium and are now in a very strong position.
``The money from the cup success will go to the manager and there is more
available which he can spend as he wishes.
``He knows what he has available but the real future for this club is its
home-produced players - Stephen Glass proved that again in the cup final.''
Aitken, meanwhile, wants to resurrect his team's premier division challenge,
which appears to have been put on hold during the cup run. They have drifted 16
points off the pace set by Rangers, and that has to be attended to.
At the moment Aitken's side sit in fifth place, but they are closer to the
bottom of the table than the top if you examine the points totals.
Aberdeen suffered relegation torments last season when they could not string
results together with any consistency.
They have had the same problems this year in the league and Aitken knows he
cannot afford to have his team drop their standards.
Enjoying a cup success is fine, looking forward to a UEFA Cup place is even
better, but the league cannot be sidelined, and that is what Aitken will preach
to his players this week.
Meanwhile, he must also look to the future and wonder whether that will contain
the young men brought up at Pittodrie, such as Booth and Eoin Jess.
Midfielder Jess, rated at #3m, is one of seven top players out of contract at
the end of the season, and Aitken said: ``I will now be looking into
negotiations with those players to start sorting things out.
``Everybody seems to be happy with things at the moment, but there are several
out of contract and I want to know what their intentions are.''
A cup win brings immediate champagne and then, inevitably, for any manager he
headaches follow, especially when they must try to keep their star players out
of the clutches of more powerful rivals.

Cape Town
A TOP South African official said today that the murder of a cashier during a
botched robbery attempt at an international boxing bout involving British
fighter Warren Stowe in Cape Town would not harm the country's bid for the 2004
Olympics.
However, the city's tourism chief Gordon Oliver said that yesterday's shooting
was a body blow to Cape Town's drive to become a major international tourism
venue. And another official said it was a major setback to the redevelopment of
black areas.
``This is very bad news for us. We are getting an international reputation for
violence that is not deserved but it will get worse if we don't do something
about it,'' said Oliver.
Describing the murder as a ``terrible isolated incident'', Chris Ball, chief
executive of Cape Town's Olympic bid committee, said that it would not impair
the city's ability to bid for the 2004 Games.
``Security has always been a necessary ongoing priority in the preparation of
Cape Town's bid,'' he said.
Stowe and his South African opponent Simon Maseko dived from the ring when
shots rang out during their middleweight clash at Guguletu township.
The bout was being screened live and television viewers watched in horror as
frightened broadcasters huddled under ringside tables, with fighters, fans and
officials seeking cover behind plastic chairs and overturned tables.
Cashier Wynand Bothma, who was counting the takings near the main entrance, was
killed during the shooting. His bloodstained body lay next to the table.
Today Stowe said that he thought he was going to die. ``I didn't know there was
a robbery going on. I thought they were shooting at me . . . I was terrified, I
thought I was going to die at that time,'' he said.
President Nelson Mandela, who is guiding South Africa from apartheid to
majority rule, said he had discussed the incident with Safety and Security
Minister Sydney Mufamadi but had no immediate comment.
Cape Town police spokesman Raymond Dowd said detectives had firm leads and
expected to make an arrest soon. He said a reward of 50,000 rand #9000 had been
offered.
Dowd said that security at indoor sports events was usually the responsibility
of organisers, adding: ``Obviously, the police can't be everywhere.''
Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the African National Congress member of parliament for
Guguletu, said the incident was a major setback to the redevelopment of black
areas.
``We are stunned and outraged. We are trying so hard to build the image and
morale of the area and this is absolutely the last thing we need,'' she said.
q A fan was killed in Pietersburg at a soccer match involving the country's
most popular team, Kaizer Chiefs. Security officials also confiscated more than
40 handguns from spectators entering the ground. In Johannesburg a security
officer shot himself in the foot as he celebrated a goal.-Reuter

THE Chancellor took a break from Budget preparations yesterday for the slightly
wider issue of a single European currency.
Mr Kenneth Clarke was in Brussels meeting other EU finance ministers to discuss
technical moves towards monetary union.
The talks were dominated by a suggestion from Germany's finance minister Theo
Waigel that there should be a stability pact among EU states opting to join
monetary union, leading to a single currency by 1999, and those in the pact
would enforce budgetary discipline, including the possible use of fines for
states who did not obey the rules.
Mr Clarke said he did not believe the suggestions were a great threat to
national sovereignty.
``Theo Waigel has always been as clear as I have that the setting of tax is for
national governments, the setting of public expenditures is for national
governments. The kind of Budget I have tomorrow will always continue,'' he said.
Meanwhile, a rift in the European Commission over the proposed single currency
was exposed last night by former Labour leader and now Commissioner, Mr Neil
Kinnock.
He said monetary union in 1999 was ``unrealistic''. Commissioners in Brussels
have spent months denying they have serious doubts.

motorists in the Budget.

<TEXT>
A MODEL-railway fanatic who used stolen credit cards to fraudulently purchase
99 toy locomotives has been jailed for 21 months.
Irishman Andrew Skally, 48, was dubbed ``the great little train robber'' after
he stole credit cards from people staying in religious retreats and used them
to buy the models, worth #3000, from shops across Britain.
He went to nunneries and monasteries and stole credit cards which were then
used to buy the top-of-the-range toys at Beatties stores - including ones in
East Kilbride, Glasgow, Kilmarnock, and Dumfries.
During his spree, which began in October 1992, he visited 35 branches of the
toy chain.
Police believe Skally travelled on British Rail Inter City routes visiting toy
shops on the way.
On his travels, he also stole model trains from Carlisle, Manchester, Leeds,
Harrogate, Sheffield, Kettering, Northampton, London, Reading, Bristol,
Watford, Luton, Winchester, Eastleigh, Southampton, and Bournemouth.
Fraud squad officer Will Wright, who picked up Skally's trail in Southampton,
Hampshire, said: ``This has been a very challenging case - the most bizarre I
have ever investigated.
``Even the credit card companies say they had never heard of anything like it.
``Just to buy nothing but locomotives is very strange.''
A spokeswoman for Beatties said: ``People who buy trains like this are usually
collectors who buy them to look at rather than run on a model railway track.''
At Southampton Crown Court, Hampshire, Skally, from Cork, admitted four charges
of obtaining property by deception.
He also pleaded guilty to four charges of burglary, two of theft, and one of
using a false instrument.
He asked for a further 129 offences to be taken into consideration.

Nottingham Forest 1,
Manchester United 1
ERIC Cantona refound his scoring boots last night against Nottingham Forest to
salvage a point for Manchester United at a frenzied City Ground.
Frank Clark's men looked to be hanging on for three points after Paul McGregor
marked his full debut with a goal after 19 minutes.
United had wasted a catalogue of chances, with Andy Cole and Ryan Giggs - who
hit the post when clean through - the most culpable.
But after 67 minutes, Cantona, who had gone six games without scoring - the
worst spell of his United career - since returning after his enforced
nine-month absence with a spot-kick equaliser against Liverpool, repeated the
dose.
It was the Frenchman who was felled from behind by Steve Chettle after he
seemed to have lost control of a pass by substitute Paul Scholes.
Forest protested furiously when referee Keith Cooper instantly pointed to the
spot, but the defender had undoubtedly made contact and Cantona ignored the
jeers to stroke confidently home.
Right at the death, Forest could have snatched victory but Richard Irving
headed wide when it looked easier to score.

JAILED Arlene Elliot danced round her cell less than three hours before she
hanged herself with a makeshift noose.
A joint fatal accident inquiry heard yesterday that she had begged prison
doctors to take her off a powerful tranquilliser which was making her depressed.
Miss Elliot, a 17-year-old paranoid schizophrenic, was being dosed with the
tranquilliser Largactil every six hours at Cornton Vale jail near Stirling.
Her former cellmate, Anne McCann, sobbed as she told the inquiry at Stirling
Sheriff Court about Miss Elliot's last hours.
Miss McCann, 27, of Tormore Street, Govan, Glasgow, said: ``Arlene had written
a dirty letter to her boyfriend the night it happened. We laughed all the way
through it.
``I went to sleep on the top bunk but woke up to find her dancing about the
room. She was a dead happy wee lassie.''
When asked if she knew of anything that was bothering Miss Elliot, Miss McCann,
who is still a prisoner, blamed the strong tranquilliser.
She said: ``Arelene didn't need it and had asked to be taken off it because it
was making her depressed. In the morning before taking her medication she was
all right. After she got it she was pure depressed, pure down.''
Earlier, the inquiry heard that a third prisoner at Cornton Vale had tried to
hang herself in the same block less than a week after Miss Elliot's death, and
nine days after the death of Kelly Holland, also 17.
Prison staff had been alerted after finding a note in the the cell of
mother-of-three Esther Dale, 24.
Prison officer Margaret Horne, 39, said she had spent nearly an hour in Mrs
Dale's cell discussing her personal problems and trying to assist her.
Later, while prisoners were being locked up for the night, Mrs Dale, of Kerr
Street, Bridgeton, Glasgow, ran into an empty sitting room, tied a curtain
round her neck, and jumped off a radiator.
Mrs Horne said she ran to the room after hearing screams and she and another
two officers managed to get Mrs Dale down.
Mrs Dale escaped with only a bruised neck.
The inquiry heard that the prison had no system to check whether warders who
were supposed to be carrying out regular observations of suicide-risk prisoners
were actually doing so.
Investigating officer Detective Sergeant Andy Price said Miss Holland should
have been checked every 15 minutes by remand block officer John McFadyen, 32,
who had been on active service for only two months.
But there was no way of being certain that the checks were carried out on time
every time.
Mr Price said: ``I asked if there was a record of the observations, whereby an
officer ticked a box on a timesheet or used a key in a time clock.
``But I was told that he didn't write anything down, nor was there any
electronic means of recording when he carried out a particular check.''
Two seasoned prison officers broke down in the witness box as they recalled
finding Miss Elliot's body.
Moira Grattan, 32, a prison officer for four years, said she would have checked
on the prisoner in her cell after noticing that she had left a communal
recreation area.
She fought back tears as she recalled that she had been diverted by a request
to take some other prisoners for medication.
She returned in time to hear shouts, and rushed into Miss Elliot's cell to find
her hanging.
Avril McMurtie, 31, a prison officer for seven years, wept openly as she told
how she gave Miss Elliot the kiss of life.
The inquiry continues.

Washington
PREPARING for his biggest foreign military mission, President Bill Clinton told
the American people tonight that US troops must go to Bosnia to secure the
peace but would ``fight fire with fire, and then some'' if attacked.
``We cannot stop all war for all time,'' Clinton said in a television speech
from the Oval Office. ``But we can stop some wars.
``We cannot save all women and all children. But we can save many. We cannot do
everything. But we must do what we can do.
``The people of Bosnia, our Nato allies and people around the world are looking
to America for leadership. Let us lead. That is our responsibility as
Americans.''
In an address as important as any in his presidency, Clinton laid out stark
reasons for sending 20,000 American troops as part of a Nato peacekeeping force
of 60,000 that is to enforce a Bosnian accord reached last week in Dayton, Ohio.
``If we're not there, Nato will not be there. The peace will collapse. The war
will re-ignite. The slaughter of innocents will begin again. A conflict that
already has claimed so many victims could spread like poison,'' he said.
Clinton was trying to convince a wary public and a sceptical Congress to back
him on what would be the biggest military deployment of his presidency.
He said the final Nato plan for the operation is to be sent to him later this
week and if it meets his approval he will immediately send it to Congress and
request its support.
While Congress debates it, Clinton said he would allow a small number of US
troops in a Nato advance mission that will establish headquarters and set up
communications. The full force would begin deploying in Bosnia in the days
following the formal signature of the peace agreement in Paris in mid-December,
Clinton said.
``Let me say at the outset: America's role will not be about fighting a war. It
will be about helping the people of Bosnia to secure their own peace.''
He said risks to the troops would be minimised because they will be heavily
armed and thoroughly trained. Making an overwhelming show of force will lessen
the need to use force.
Clinton cautioned that no deployment of US troops is risk-free and that ``this
one may well involve casualties''.
He took full responsibility for any harm that might befall the troops, but
issued a strong warning: ``Anyone contemplating any action that would endanger
our troops should know this: America protects its own. Anyone who takes on our
troops will suffer the consequences. We will fight fire with fire, and then
some.''
A key objective of the Democratic president was to convince enough members of
the Republican-led Congress to approve a non-binding resolution authorising the
mission.
Like all recent US presidents, Clinton maintains the Constitution gives him all
the authority he needs to send US troops. But it could be political suicide to
do so without explicit congressional support, especially on the verge of a
presidential election year.
Republican leaders are backing away from confrontation with the president on
the issue. A few days before the Dayton agreement was reached, Congress voted
to refuse to allow American troops to keep the peace there. Now it appears that
they will be allowed to         do so.
Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader in the Senate, said today: ``I want to
be in a position to support the president. It seems to me, when it comes to
foreign policy, if we speak with one voice we're better off.''
The president will brief Congressional leaders in detail on the Bosnian plan
before leaving for London tomorrow.
Meanwhile, British troops are expected to be allocated the confrontation line
around the Serb stronghold of Banja Luka when the Nato peace force moves into
Bosnia next month. The area was the scene of some of the most ferocious
fighting of the three-year civil war in the run-up to the peace agreement, with
Croat and Muslim forces routing the Bosnian Serbs.
Tensions in and around Banja Luka remain high and military commanders have no
illusions about the difficulty of their task.
Bosnia is being divided into three sectors - British, American and French - for
the 60,000-strong Nato peace implementation force.
The overall operation will be run on the ground by the British-led HQ of Nato's
Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) commanded by Lieutenant General Sir Michael
Walker.
Defence Secretary Michael Portillo said Britain's contribution would amount to
13,000 troops plus the 3000 Royal Navy and RAF forces already in         the
region.

At the moment
it's voluntary.
But what if the
use of college
facilities for
school pupils
comes under
new financial
pressures?
Dick Louden
examines the
implications of
a forthcoming
report on the
`overlap' question
THE Scottish Office is funding a new research project to analyse the costs of
post-16 provision in schools and further education colleges. In financial terms
it is scarcely a major investment - the contract for #45,000 has been awarded
to KPMG Management Consulting and it is due for completion by the end of next
month - but there are already suspicions about how the information gleaned from
the project will be used.
Raymond Robertson, the Scottish Office Minister for Education, says the
objectives of the study are ``to compare the costs of comparable provision for
16-to 19-year-olds and to identify and explore the factors which may account
for differences within and between the sectors''.
He links the study to the implementation of Higher Still in 1998, saying that
``we are moving towards closer integration of the academic and vocational
strands and there is a need to look at the increasing overlap of provision in
the two sectors''.
There is nothing new in the linkage between the sectors. As long ago as 1963
the Scottish Office, in its document Half Our Future, suggested that ``there
could be a positive advantage, where conditions and facilities are suitable,
for some pupils in attending a college of further education for some part of
their course and thereby having a ready-made link with the future''.
Similar statements have been made over the years in other official publications
up to, and including, Higher Still. What is different is the new emphasis on
comparative costs.
This is sure to concern many schools. The experience gleaned from the current
Government is that, when it initiates financial studies, it uses the findings
to achieve cost-cutting measures.
Even at this early stage, it may not be too fanciful to suppose that, in the
wake of the KPMG report, the Scottish Office may exhort wider use by schools of
college facilities and expertise. This already happens, but on a voluntary
basis. It will not be welcomed if pressure is universally applied.
Recent events south of the Border are being observed with great wariness. As
colleges there feel ever tighter financial pressures, they have launched into
the business of recruiting new students under a funding formula which rewards
them for higher numbers.
Schools have become so alarmed that the Secondary Heads' Association has issued
a code of practice designed to control over-zealous marketing. Among other
things, it stipulates that publicity should not criticise other institutions,
that highly selective or misleading quotations from inspection reports should
not be used, and that the careers service should be enabled to offer balanced
and accurate advice. Last year English colleges increased their numbers 7% and
this year they are being asked to achieve further growth of 6%.
In Scotland there has been a history of closer co-operation, with schools and
colleges often entering into ``consortium'' arrangements and small schools in
particular finding real benefit in harnessing the expertise of local colleges.
Higher Still envisages the expansion of such links; but will it happen?
Running parallel to major educational changes are political trends which on the
whole promote competition rather than co-operation. Colleges are now
free-standing and schools have entered the era of devolved school management.
These developments may not favour closer working relationships. Indeed, some
schools are already suspicious of initiatives which they see as designed to
increase the number of pupils enrolling in colleges rather than staying on for
a further year.
Such initiatives include the appointment by colleges of marketing officers and
the use of press, radio and TV advertising campaigns to promote college
recruitment.
The impact of the loss of pupils at fifth and sixth years could be to undermine
the viability of courses currently on offer. In turn, this would be certain to
affect the curriculum further down the school, since it would be unreasonable
to invite pupils to embark on courses in third and fourth years if such courses
could not be continued thereafter.
In addition, the structure of DSM means that any loss of pupils to colleges
would result in a reduction in resources, since funding follows the pupils.
Already there is animated debate over the breadth of curriculum which any
school should be in a position to offer under Higher Still. Some schools will
not be able to create viable groupings in some of the new cognate areas like
travel and tourism, care, and construction. It seems likely that colleges could
become directly involved in the provision. This could, in some cases, even take
the form of franchising. In the Midlands and North of England some franchising
arrangements are already in place.
The valuable contribution which colleges can make, in collaboration with
schools, is not in question. Most people would accept that increased
co-operation between the sectors in the wake of Higher Still is perfectly
natural and healthy. For example, in the last few years, the development of
National Certificate clusters and group awards like General Scottish Vocational
Qualifications has brought schools and colleges closer and given schools access
to both the skills of college lecturers and the use of specialised equipment.
If Higher Still is to be the catalyst for closer interaction between the two
sectors, joint planning mechanisms will need to be set up to ensure that staff
collaborate in the design of courses and assessments and that more refined
guidance systems are designed to assist students to select suitable pathways
through the complex range of courses available.
If such an infrastructure is established and cross-sector co-operation is
allowed to blossom naturally, the aims of Higher Still could be advanced. If
financial resources take over, it will be quite another matter. Already some
headteachers are apprehensive that present arrangements - whereby pupils can
join college classes free of charge - may be under threat.
A national research project to analyse comparative costs will do little for
their peace of mind. They may yet feel that the concept of flexibility, so
intrinsic to everything that Higher Still stands for, is not meant to apply to
them.

NOTHING better illustrates our confusion over manners, these days, than that
historic but selectively candid interview last week. In the done thing context
it raises two questions: at what point does frankness about intimacy on
peaktime television become bad form? And, are those who settle themselves into
the lucrative role of critics too often the merchants of cheap sneers?
We used to believe that it was only Americans who possessed no social
reticence, their noisy frankness in personal matters making Europeans, with
their complex discretion, seem emotionally retarded, even shifty in the panting
skill of Telling All. But the fact is that in Britain today the Royal Saga of
Splitsville has created the age of staged confessions, a shrewd and not
unstylish trick whereby the figures in question, by announcing their own
frailties, aim to blunt the razor of other people's hostile disclosures.
The justification, of course, is that once one side has reneged on joint
custody of a secret, the other side has the right to do the same. Such is the
modern view of equality, but in strict etiquette terms a secret is a secret
between two people only, and whoever breaks it is tarnished with dishonour. As
for critics, the worst operate from a hidden agenda, outwardly livid at
``manipulative disclosure'' but earning fat cheques from stoking prurient
furies, all the same.
But if anything did for good manners it was national hypocrisy, and today our
relish of scandals is the revenge of those who know now that they were being
conned. It is the relish of seeing someone ``up there'' who has been caught
out. As a result, short of flossing your gnashers at the table, there is not
much these days which is howled down as a preposterous breach of courtesy.
Cut-and-dried rules on correct behaviour died with the overthrow of debutantes
and calling cards, and the gliding servility of ``may I replenish the teapot,
Milady?'' Today if a man holds a door open for a womam, it is either because
she is his mother, or he is a bellhop with an upturned hand.
But the everyday decline in social graces is not the fault of one sex more than
the other. Men have been thrown off balance in their attitudes to women because
of certain loud-mouthed female chauvinists who always choose to confuse
civility with condescension. In fact, anyone who tells you good manners are
automatically sexist and psychologically crippling is very often nothing but an
absolute swine.
So, just what are the concerns of contemporary politesse? Well, in an age when
even bureaucracy's literature refers to partner rather than spouse, no-one need
agonise any longer over the correct wording for a wedding invitation. Indeed,
in the pages of the more authoritative etiquette books, the most pressing
dilemma will go something like this; Question: Should a woman carry a
toothbrush on a first date? Answer: Only discreetly.
Out in the business world, however, protocol is still uncharted territory for
women, and even the most talented among them are sometimes unsure about the
club rules of corporate behaviour. Should women remain seated when male
colleagues leap to their feet when the chairman enters the room?
The simplest solution seems to be to rise with the rest of them. Indeed, this
is not so much reversed gallantry as strategical: the woman board director who
remains demurely in her chair at the conference table will probably be mistaken
by the chairman for the person taking that meeting's minutes, which then means
she will also be the one expected to pour the coffee.
Curiously protocol is actually far higher up the worry list in America than it
is in today's spivvy Britain. There the searching issue of the moment revolves
around: what to do when someone is askew? Advice and correspondence columns of
magazines and newspapers tremble with anxiety for the woman with lipstick on
her teeth and, worse still, for the man with the unzipped zipper. Do men tell
men? Or, more challengingly, do women tell men?
The general consensus is that friends will gently alert each other when they
observe smudged cosmetics, an open fly, or a squidge of spinach locked
resolutely on to the front tooth. Acquaintances, although they might not feel
the same obligation, will probably do the same, but enemies will calculate
which action will cause the most chagrin: telling or not telling. And really
malicious folk, the ones much practised in cruelty, will lean forward and
ostentatiously correct the victim's wretched little handicap themselves.

THE Convention of Scottish Local Authorities yesterday published its own terms
for establishing a new partnership between central and local government.
Council leaders acted in advance of the much-publicised speech on the future
government of Scotland, due to be delivered by Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth in Glasgow on Thursday.
Labour-lead Cosla claimed the past 20 years under the Tories had been a history
of ``continuous tinkering coupled with the centralisation of power''.
The outcome had been a relationship defined exclusively by central Government
rather than a relationship based on partnership, it said.
The convention, in a written statement, said there must be agreement on where
the boundaries of central and local government begin and end.
Within the overall framework established by central Government, councils should
have the freedom to decide on their own internal structures, operation and
service delivery arrangements, it says.
On this basis, the recent attacks by Government Ministers on the committee
structures of some of the new councils, and the number of officials they are
employing, were not only inaccurate but also unjustified.
``Who is best placed to decide how many committees or officers a council needs,
the Scottish Office or local councils?'' asks Cosla.
``To whom should a council be accountable for the decisions it makes about its
committee or management structures - its own community through the ballot box
or the Scottish Office?''
It says that finance was at the root of most of the difficulties which now
bedevil the relationship between central and local government.
Councils must be allowed to raise more than 51% of their revenue locally,
compared with the present 15%, to encourage citizens to understand that their
votes are critical in determining the spending decisions of their council.
To try to achieve this aim, the Government should set up an independent
commission to review the financing of local government in Scotland, says Cosla.
Cosla also calls for a period of stability in the relationship between central
and local government to give the new organisational structures of the unitary
councils the chance to bed down.

LAST night the City was backing its hunch that Chancellor of the Exchequer
Kenneth Clarke will introduce a fiscally sound Budget this afternoon with
reductions in planned Government spending and extra indirect taxes largely
offsetting cuts in income and capital taxes, worth a few billion pounds.
Gilts and equities were in record-breaking territory yesterday as the City
sensed that the Budget would be tight enough to please financial markets and
permit a half-point cut in interest rates before Christmas. The FTSE-100 Share
index jumped 25 points to close at a record 3649.0.
Sterling scored good gains against the mark amid mounting speculation that the
Bundesbank would deliver a cut in German rates this week. Its trade weighted
index added 0.2 to 83.2, well clear of last week's low of 82.5.
For the financial markets the key figure in the Budget will be the size of next
year's Public Sector Borrowing Requirement. The City knows this year's PSBR
will be substantially higher than the Treasury's estimate a year ago of #21.5bn
and is reconciled to it being revised upwards to around #28bn.
The economy has slowed down and tax takes have lagged behind the original
estimates, but Government spending has been tightly controlled. That much is
history. Had this year's public finances turned out in the way the Treasury
forecast, the PSBR would be dropping to around 3% of gross domestic product,
the target enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty. The outcome is likely to be
closer to 4%.
In his last Budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer forecast a PSBR for 1996-7
of #13bn, equal to 1.75% of GDP, but in the summer this was revised up to
#16bn. No-one expects him to match either of these figures this time round. The
consensus in the City is for a PSBR of around #20bn. More optimistic
projections at James Capel suggest #18bn.
A figure of #20bn or less would result in next year's PSBR falling below the
psychologically important 3% mark and indicate that Mr Clarke's fiscal strategy
was back on course to deliver a continuing decline in public borrowing, albeit
a little behind schedule.
But if the City thinks the Chancellor's tax cuts are being financed out of
public borrowing the gilts market would be likely to take the strain and with
it sterling. A cut in rates would become much more problematic. Mr Clarke
cannot afford renewed weakness in the pound, which would threaten a further
deterioration in the nation's inflation profile, or a hostile gilts market
which would raise the Government's borrowing costs.
The Budget will also contain the Government's economic forecasts upon which
most of the spending and revenue projections are based. A year ago the
Chancellor thought the economy would grow 3.25% this year, but activity has
slowed down much more than the Treasury mandarins anticipated. James Capel is
forecasting 2.5% growth in GDP this year, but it could easily be less.
Capel economists expect the Treasury to stick with its forecast of underlying
inflation of 2.5% in the final quarter of next year, in line with the
Government's own target. Activity will be sluggish in the first half of next
year, but should pick up later on. Capel's Adam Cole expects GDP growth of 2.5%
in 1996, perhaps even 2.75%.
The award-winning economics team at investment bank Goldman Sachs are much more
pessimistic. They expect the economy to slow down to a snail's pace in the next
two quarters as companies work their way through the stock overhang. A pick-up
is envisaged in the second half of next year, but overall David Walton and
Martin Brookes are forecasting below trend growth of just 1.75% next year.
Because of this they have become increasingly confident that the Government
will meet its inflation target. ``We are now leaning strongly to the view that
base rates could be cut by up to 1% over the next six to nine months,'' they
said. The Goldman Sachs team also sees scope for tax cuts of #4000m to #5000m
in the Budget, a bit more than the City consensus and well above its own
earlier forecast.
If the City considers that Mr Clarke has been too optimistic about the
prospects for growth then it would be wary of the Treasury's PSBR forecasts.
Another shortfall in revenues due to lower than expected growth could play
havoc with the projections.
One aid the Chancellor has in pruning public spending is the contingency
reserve. Next year's reserve was fixed at #6000m, and there is a widespread
expectation that he can safely reduce this to #3000m, in line with the figure
fixed for the current year. But the City will want to see evidence of real cuts
in planned public spending before it will be convinced the Budget arithmetic
adds up.
The Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England next meet on December 13
to decide monetary policy. If the Budget is well received by the financial
markets, the betting is that Mr Clarke will talk Eddie George into a rate cut
and justify it with the growing indications that the economy has slowed down to
below its trend rate of growth of 2.25% per annum.
In Germany inflation is below 2% and continuing to fall. The money supply poses
no inflationary threats and the economy has slowed down sharply. All of this
suggests that the Bundesbank will oblige the rest of the world with a
half-point cut in its discount rate to 3% when its council meets on Thursday.
This would make it much easier for Mr Clarke to force through a rate cut
without damaging sterling's long-term prospects. There is also a lot of clever
money backing the US Federal Reserve to trim short-term money market rates by a
quarter point after the FOMC meeting on December 19.
But Kenneth Clarke needs to turn in a convincing performance today before he
can hope to exploit the apparent trend towards lower rates on both sides of the
Atlantic. He has a much wider constituency to satisfy than the army of
backbenchers behind him hungry for a tax-cutting bonanza.

A BID to bring together efforts by Scottish businesses to beat crime was
launched yesterday.
The planned business-crime centre will provide security advice and training
across the entire spectrum, from tiny firms to large corporations.
It has the support of CBI Scotland, the Scottish clearing banks, police forces,
local authorities, and the Government.
Launching the scheme, Home Affairs Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton said
there were 35,000 break-ins at non-domestic premises every year and small
businesses alone lost #1m a week as a result of crime.
``Crime against business affects everyone in Scotland, because we all have a
stake in the well-being of commercial enterprise. It threatens jobs because it
reduces profits and increases prices for the law-abiding majority in the
community,'' he said.
The proposed centre will deal with all aspects of crime, from shoplifting,
staff theft, and fraud to fire raising, violence, and break-ins.
The idea came from an action group set up by the Scottish Crime Prevention
Council. The Scottish Office will share the #100,000 annual running cost with
industry.
``We intend it to be a centre for excellence at the forefront of thinking on
crime prevention, geared up to communicate knowledge to businesses, support
organisations, and others who need it. Information on best practice will be
delivered through a helpline service, briefing sessions, and training
courses,'' Lord James said.
It was supported yesterday by a crime victim, Mr John Russell, chairman of John
G Russell Transport, a member of the action group and CBI Scotland
representative on the council.
His firm had a #250,000 shipment of whisky stolen earlier this year. It was
recovered. He said police were extremely helpful but could not recommend
specific equipment and sales people were only interested in selling their own
products.
The centre will also draw on the successful experience of the Gyle Shopping
Centre in Edinburgh. Since opening in October 1993, it has had 18 million
visitors but only 438 recorded crimes, the result of successful partnerships
between retailers, local authorities, and police.
Similarly, effective security measures by Scottish banks, like the use of red
dye on notes, have cut armed robberies from a peak of 84 in 1992 to just six in
the first half of this year.
Mr Mike Todd, of the Bank of Scotland, who represented the Scottish clearing
banks on the action group, said: ``When we started off, we found there were a
lot of good ideas and individual initiatives but no forum to make these
available to the wider business community. This is what the business crime
centre can achieve.'

WE were in Vaasa, the largest town (55,000 population) in the main
Swedish-speaking province of Finland. Across the Gulf of Bothnia lay Sweden
itself. Here, reflecting the six centuries until 1809 during which the Swedish
crown controlled Finland, nearly a quarter of the province's 450,000 people
still claim Swedish as their native tongue.
The provincial governor, Tom Westergard, gave up his day to show us his
intriguing patch. He first took us to a local factory, where Wartsila Diesel
employs nearly 1300 people making medium-speed engines for marine propulsion
and power generation, mostly for export.
The diversified (and state-supported) local economy ranges from Wartsila's
heavy engineering to fur farming, carpet weaving, and the production of wooden
summer house kits. Yet provincial unemployment soared in the 1990s, in line
with the national Finnish trend, to a peak of 18%.
After a lunch of mushroom soup and white fish at a remote, windswept restaurant
on one of the islands in the archipelago, the governor took us, by coastguard
cutter, out into the gulf. Velvet scoters rose in flocks. A sea eagle quartered
the launch. Within half an hour we were halfway to Sweden. It's that close.
Back on dry land, we made our way to the offices of the local liberal Swedish
language newspaper, the Vasabladet, part-funded by the small Swedish People's
Party.
Given the unprecedented levels of unemployment across Finland in recent years,
the inevitable provincial suspicion of Helsinki as the main metropolitan
honeypot for investment, and Vaasa's minority Swedish cultural heritage, I
asked the editor-in-chief Dennis Rundt whether secessionist tendencies ever
broke surface in the province.
``No, absolutely not,'' he replied. ``We know too much about Sweden in this
part of Finland.'' In fact the Swedish People's Party, which has the allegiance
of around 85% of the native Swedish speakers in Finland, is part of the present
coalition government in Helsinki, boasting two Ministers from a parliamentary
group of just 11.
That left-led coalition is struggling with burgeoning state debt and the
consequences of a welfare system designed for the days when unemployment was
3%, not 18%. Back in Helsinki, Marja Kaisa Aula, a vice-chairman of the
opposition centre party, the KESK, which had been in continuous power for 40
years until 1987, was up to a familiar political ploy. She was accusing the
other side of pinching her party's policies.
The KESK's traditional coalition partners, the conservative KOK, are now in bed
with the Finnish Social Democratic Party and three smaller parties, including
the Swedish People's Party, in the present rainbow coalition which governs
Finland.
``When we were in government the SDP used to say: don't cut, spend more, to
cope with the recession,'' she recalled. ``It's interesting to see how rapidly
opinions can change. The general line of the Lipponen government now is not so
far away from what we were proposing in the election campaign, although they
are proposing to cut those with the weakest voices most.'' That will cause
particular problems in northern Finland, she warned. Needless to say Ms Aula's
centre party - with its agrarian traditions and, its opponents allege, an
attachment to farming subsidies surpassed only by the Swiss - is strongest in
north and central Finland.
I was reminded of these recent Nordic encounters when I heard Michael Forsyth,
at Scottish questions in the Commons last week, again lambasting proposals for
home rule here. He picked the recent referendum in Quebec as a lesson for us
all in Scotland. ``If you feed the crocodile,'' he warned MPs ``you end up
getting eaten.''
Apart from the fact that that analogy is a highly idiosyncratic reading of
Canada's complex confederal constitutional history, the Scottish Secretary's
choice of words, on the eve of his St Andrew's Day revelations, is instructive.
Any people's desire for a greater democratic say over the decisions which most
affect their lives is, Mr Forsyth appears to imply, as insatiable and
indiscriminate as a large reptile's appetite. And precisely who is that you,
the hapless victim who ends up in the beast's belly when all available food is
exhausted?
Maybe the Scottish Secretary was simply indulging in a bit of sensational
headline grabbing, coming up with a Jurassic Park reworking of the old slippery
slope argument about home rule. But, as the example of Finland's Vaasa
province, Catalonia in Spain and many other local situations testify, the slope
isn't always precipitous and the crocodile does sometimes learn fresh tricks.
The real danger lies in ignoring the legitimate appetite for home rule
altogether. Down that road lies a future where regional hostilities fester and
multiply. The Scots are feather-bedded subsidy junkies, claims one side.
Greater London and the South-east has its snout deepest in the trough, counters
the other. Down that road we all end up in the crocodile's belly.
In purely economic terms, Scotland's is now as diverse an economy as the UK as
a whole. For example, the Government's most recent detailed regional accounts,
for 1992, show that household disposable income per capita in Lothian (112.8 on
a scale which places the UK as a whole at 100) was almost on a par with Greater
London (113.7).
Tayside (106.5) and Grampian (106.4) outdid Oxfordshire (105) and Berkshire
(105.6). Borders (at 101.3) was doing nearly as well as Devon (102.3). It's
only when you get to Strathclyde (96.3) and Highlands and Islands (95.8) that
Scottish household disposable income per head falls well below the UK average.
But even at that level, they are in line with East Midlands (95.9) and ahead of
the Isle of Wight (94.5).
You wouldn't know that if your only diet was the yah-boo claim and counterclaim
of Scotland versus the rest. But to get beyond the sterility of Scotland versus
the rest we need a new focus. That focus, in my view, can come only from giving
Scots a greater measure of responsibility for their own future. If we did, I
suspect we might find that the crocodiles are outnumbered.

A DISTRICT court magistrate yesterday made a gagging order on a flock of noisy
cockerels whose crowing has driven neighbours to distraction.
The order on Royal Naval Commander Kenneth Ayres and his wife Julie followed a
rare legal move launched last week by the couple's neighbours, Michael and
Marie Bateman, who claimed the constant dawn-till-dusk din was ruining their
lives.
Dumbarton District Court Justice of the Peace Richard Dickson ruled that Mr and
Mrs Ayres, both 53, must:
q Get rid of three of their four cockerels.
q Contain the remaining one and any hens in a single flock.
q Lock them up in total darkness between dusk or 7pm (whichever is earlier) and
9am throughout the year.
q Build a new hen-house further away from the Batemans' home.
q Feed and water them in the one area, to encourage them to remain in that area.
q Erect an 8ft high fence around their entire back garden, with the top two
feet being angled at 45 degrees.
Mr Dickson ordered that the measures must be in place by Christmas Day and
added that getting rid of the three cockerels was not a destruction order.
Mrs Ayres shouted at Mr Dickson: ``I demand to know how you came to such a
harsh and unreasonable judgment. Do you hate cockerels?''
He replied: ``I considered all the evidence and I came to my findings on the
balance of probabilities. I reached my conclusion mainly on what I heard in
court and, to a lesser degree, on what I saw and heard when I visited the
properties.''
Outside the courtroom, Commander Ayres, who is based at the Clyde Submarine
Base at Faslane, said: ``This fence is going to turn our place into a
concentration camp. The judgment will severely restrict our personal freedom of
movement and our ability to enjoy our life.''
Mrs Ayres said: ``How do I possibly choose which cockerel to keep? I love them
all. If you had four children and were told to get rid of three, how would you
choose? I don't have children, my animals are my family.''
Mr Bateman, 67, a retired merchant navy captain, used to own and live in a
former farmhouse in secluded Glen Fruin, near Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire.
When his family grew up and moved out, he and his wife converted a barn into a
retirement cottage - and sold the main house three years ago to Mr Ayres. He
and his wife introduced a variety of farmyard poultry and fowls, including
several cockerels.
The Batemans claimed the birds have made their life a misery by screeching
every day of the year for an average of seven hours.
In an unusual move, Mr Dickson made the 30-mile round trip from Dumbarton to
Glen Fruin with Mr Bateman and Mr Ayres to see and hear the cockerels for
himself.
Mr Bateman raised the action under the Civic Government Act (Annoying Creatures
Provisions), which empowers the court to take any measure to curb the noise,
short of destroying the birds.
He said last night: ``We feel we were fully justified in bringing the action.
Our only reason for doing so was to establish our right to live in peace in our
own home.''
Asked what he intended to do with the three cockerels, Mr Ayres replied: ``Send
them in a box to Mr Bateman.''
He added: ``The magistrate expressed a wish last week that whatever judgment he
came to might mend any rift between neighbours. I would say the prospect of
that is now impossible.''

Paging Kenny Dalglish: the Scottish connection may be obvious, but when world
snooker champion Stephen Hendry, and the most capped footballer in Scotland's
history, Kenny Dalglish, usually meet socially, the green is the grass of a
golf course rather than the baize.
Pro-am tournaments, we are told, are graced regularly by their attendance.
Yesterday, however, the Blackburn Rovers' director of football took time out to
help pal Hendry launch his new book in Preston, as well as give him support as
he defends the UK snooker championship at the Guild Hall.
And let's face it, the idea of someone signing his name on the dotted line is
not unusual for Dalglish.

THE Northern Ireland peace process stalled badly last night after Mr John Major
rejected a suggestion from Irish Prime Minister John Bruton that British
security forces' weapons should be treated in the same way as terrorist arms.
A 30-minute telephone conversation failed to agree a way forward which could
see the decommissioning of illegal arms and the start of talks between all the
province's political parties.
The main stumbling block was the terms of reference for an international
commission which would supervise the handing in of guns and bombs. Downing
Street said that it had been ``a useful discussion of issues'' and the leaders
had agreed to be in touch again ``in due course'' but declined to specify when.
The implication was that both Governments had run out of ideas for resolving
the deadlock.
Mr Bruton wanted the commission to be able to consider if Army and RUC weapons
should be scaled down as well as those held by the IRA and loyalist groups.
Mr Major sharply rejected the idea of ``equivalence'' between arms held by the
security forces and those held illegally, ready for use if terrorism breaks out
again.
The conversation killed hopes of a breakthrough before the arrival of President
Clinton in Britain tomorrow for talks at Downing Street before going on to tour
the province on Thursday and visit the Republic on Friday.
The Prime Ministers were unable to find a way round the decommissioning
problem. The British Government says that, once the commission is set up, Sinn
Fein could not be prevented from raising the question of security force arms.
However, Mr Major would not agree terms of reference for the commission which
could have given it the right to recommend reductions in the Army presence in
Northern Ireland and changes to policing arrangements. That, he said, was
entirely a matter for Westminster.
Downing Street sources insisted that the peace process has not broken down but
it seems clear that, unless President Clinton has a rabbit to pull out of the
hat, it is in trouble.
Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams argues that decommissioning should come after a
Northern Ireland settlement has been agreed, while the Unionist party leaders
have made it clear that they will not sit at the negotiating table until at
least some weaponry has been handed over.
Sinn Fein is making menacing noises about a resumption of violence unless talks
begin soon and, while the effects of a year of peace on their own supporters
may make them cautious about being the first to break the ceasefire, the
possibility cannot be ruled out.
The failure is a bitter disappointment for Mr Major, who last Friday seemed to
believe a deal could be struck. However, there was disappointment when Mr
Bruton's revised proposals were examined over the weekend.
His only concession was that setting up an elected assembly in the province
should be considered along with decommissioning and beginning preliminary talks
with all the political parties.
Glasgow Hillhead MP George Galloway was one of the signatories to a letter to
The Herald endorsing a Scottish Committee for Peace in Ireland demand that the
Prime Minister set a date for the start of all-party talks without precondition.
He said: ``We are on the brink of the whole Irish peace deal collapsing and I
can't undertand why the Prime Minister could let this pass. It could be his
crowning glory, but it has been sacrificed on the altar for a few Tory
backwoodsmen.''
Mr Galloway said that support for Mr Major's stance had waned. He added: ``The
bulldog mentality of digging your heels in at all costs is risking everything,
and more people are recognising that.''

THE economy yesterday received a #20m boost with a decision by the world's
biggest airline, Delta, to base its European reservations sales centre in
London.
The move will create 200 new jobs and was praised by Industry and Energy
Minister Tim Eggar.
``This confirms Britain's position as the preferred location for international
investment,'' he said.
The new telephone centre brings together the American carrier's reservation
offices throughout Europe. It will be based at Park Royal in west London and
will open in the middle of January.
The centre will handle reservations and sales for 11 European countries. The
decision to locate in the UK follows months of work between the airline and
various British agencies including the Government-sponsored London First Centre.
John Cox, the centre's chief executive, said yesterday: ``London won because it
is the only European city able to offer Delta the skilled, flexible
multi-lingual workforce it requires.''
Delta's move follows that of another giant US carrier, American Airlines, which
last week decided to base its            European sales operation in Dublin.
n Deutsche Lufthansa yesterday announced flat earnings in the first nine months
of the year, saying costs resulting from the strength of the mark prevented it
from posting higher earnings.
Pre-tax profit before special items rose by DM4m or 0.8% to DM506m, the airline
said in a statement. It said the strong mark cost it DM440m in lost revenues
and writedowns.
``If the currency results had not spoiled our business performance, the higher
output we achieved would have been reflected in a super result,'' said
Lufthansa chief executive Juergen Weber.
Revenue rose by 4.7% to DM14.2bn despite the mark's strength.
Lufthansa's shares rose by 4% or DM7.50 to DM195 after the results were
announced, outpacing a 1.40% rise in the index of 30 leading German shares.

<HEADLINE>Banker has `no time' for devolution</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>IAN McCONNELL</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>1</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975159364</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SIR Bruce Pattullo, Governor of the Bank of Scotland, yesterday told business
leaders in Glasgow that he had ``no time whatsoever'' for devolution.
Expressing his personal views, rather than the bank's, at a members-only
meeting of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, Sir Bruce said support for devolution
was primarily associated with a ``romantic notion''.
It would be an added complication and additional burden for Scottish business,
Sir Bruce said.
``My personal position about devolution is that I have no time for it
whatsoever.
``It will be an on-cost to all our businesses. There is no doubt it will raise
costs in due course.''
However, Mr George Robertson, the Shadow Scottish Secretary, dismissed the
outspoken views of Sir Bruce.
He said: ``I would not pretend for a minute that there are not individuals who
do not share our enthusiasm but the most important message from the Scottish
Chambers of Commerce survey, published last week, is that Scottish business is
no longer blindly accepting Tory scare stories.''
Sir Bruce, who steered a diplomatic line on devolution in the bank's latest
annual report, acknowledged that he had refrained from expressing his personal
point of view in public.
He told his audience: ``I think a number of business people, certainly
including myself, are reluctant to be seen to be taking too political a stance
because of what the opinion polls are showing.''
He said that what he thought, personally, was not important.
The Edinburgh-based Bank of Scotland has had discussions with Mr Robertson, who
has allayed one of its major fears by giving an assurance that there would be
no difference in the rates of corporation tax north and south of the Border, if
a Scottish parliament were established.
If Scotland had a higher rate of corporation tax, companies might move
operations south of the Border. A greater tax burden might also discourage
further inward investment.
Sir Bruce acknowledged that companies considered countries' corporation and
personal tax rates when making investment decisions. However, responding to a
question from the floor, he refused to comment on whether a higher rate of
income tax might discourage investment in Scotland.
The Scottish Constitutional Convention, of which Labour and the Liberal
Democrats are members, proposes a Scottish parliament with the power to levy
income tax at 3p in the pound above or below the UK rate.
Sir Bruce, who was knighted earlier this year, said the bank had received
``total confirmation'' from pro-devolution politicians that supervision of all
UK banks would remain the responsibility of the Bank of England.
It had also been assured that financial regulation generally would remain
unchanged.
He advised Scottish business leaders to raise their specific concerns with
those devising devolution proposals.
Touching on the bank's own talks with Labour, Sir Bruce said: ``I don't think
we fulfil our responsibility as business leaders if we don't think of how we
are going to cope past the next election.''
Sir Bruce said Labour needed to be specific about the powers of any Scottish
assembly and had to be strong enough to say what powers would be withheld from
it. The greater the uncertainty which could be removed, the less devolution
would be anathema to the financial markets.

A DISPIRITED Santa us not an appealing festive idea. But it is tempting to
think that poor old St Nicholas, flying high through the skies with his
sleighful of goodies, must secretly bemoan the fact that a lot of the designer
label packages weighing down the reindeer contain nothing more exciting than a
utilitarian pair of socks, or some underwear.
The thrifty Scot must take a large part of the blame here. We generally tend to
play safe and buy something mainstream which we know the other person will
like. We really hate handing over hard-earned cash on anything less than a safe
bet. But isn't this the one time of the year to go that little bit extra and
buy something even slightly different? We don't need to throw common sense
completely out of the window, but let's live a little off the straight and
narrow for a change, and give Santa a break.
One of the more daring gift ideas is the helicopter trip, which is increasing
in popularity, and no wonder, for it can be a really exciting experience. The
transparent shell of the helicopter gives a bird's eye view of the landscape
below, and all sorts of services, from city tours to corporate hospitality
trips, can be fixed up.
For those who like the unexpected, the unpredictability of balloon trips is
ideal. These rely heavily on weather conditions, you can't choose where you
want to go but are mostly at the mercy of the wind direction. If you strike
lucky, a sunny afternoon or evening drifting high in the skye above the Clyde
Valley really is a gift to remember, especially if you can see your nearest and
dearest hairing around below in their cars, trying not to lose sight of the
balloon and wondering where it will finally choose to land. Then what better
way to finish the day than with a champagne toast to your first
lighter-than-air experience.
Or if you want to introduce an educational element, how about a first flying
lesson. But be warned. Only start this if you're sure you won't have to pay for
any further trips which might result from the passion you provoke.
For the less adventurous, splash out on a few drinks with a difference. If you
usually buy bottles of spirits for friends, instead of choosing their usual
brand, try going one over the eight. Take a look at liqueurs, for instance,
which are ofen temptingly packaged with chocolates to match. Cocktails have
become extremely fashionable, so if you know an enthusiastic host, a recipe
book and a bottle of one of the more unusual ingredients, such as blue curacao,
may go down well. There are also lots of eye-catching glasses made specially to
suit particular cocktails, as well as some of the new kinds of lagers and beers.
Alcohol in the very different forms of perfumes and aftershaves must be one the
most popular gifts, and along with makeup, accounts for a large porportion of
most people's present-buying budgets. This is one area where the otherwise
fairly run-of-the mill gift vouchers can really win. If you know someone who
could do with an expensive haircut, but who never seems to be able to find the
time to arrange one, give them a voucher for it. The thrift which often works
against us will come into play, and they'll make sure they don't let the
voucher lapse and miss the treat. The same goes for any other kind of beauty
treatment, such as facials or manicures. Most salons and beauty clinics also
have treatments suitable for men.
Children are generally easy to buy for at this time of the year, because
there's so much advertising on television and in the press that most can rhyme
off a 65-item list of essential gifts. Even it they're not interested in
clothes, toys and sweets still leave plenty of scope.
Animal magic seems to have entered the realms of gifts for little girls, with
one store offering a range of unusual rucksacks in the shape of furry cows,
pigs, rabbits and monkeys. There are purses to match, and although they don't
have a clip to fasten them to a waistband, they should be difficult to lose
simply because they are so large and eye-catching. There's also a range of bum
bags for lighter days.

<HEADLINE>Call to cut drink-drive limi. Police plea to halve legal level as Christmas campaign begins</HEADLINE>

POLICE yesterday called for the legal drink-driving limit to be almost halved.
The move came at the official launch in Paisley of the Scottish forces' 10th
annual festive season campaign.
The move would cut the limit from 80 milligrammes of alcohol per 100
millilitres of blood to 50 milligrammes per 100 millilitres, the equivalent,
for a male of average weight and build, of consuming one pint of ordinary
lager, two glasses of wine, or one large whisky.
The reduction would be the first since breath tests were introduced in 1967 and
would be set at the minimum level which police estimate would allow for the
presence of alcohol through natural processes or because the driver had taken
medication.
In Scotland, 2250 people were killed or seriously injured as a result of
alcohol-related road accidents in the five-year period to 1993.
Proposing the change, Mr William Spence, traffic chairman of the Association of
Police Officers in Scotland (Apcos), said: ``Police see a clear link between
the consumption of alcohol by motorists, no matter how small a quantity, and
the greatly increased risk of becoming involved in an accident.''
He said Glasgow University research in 1994 showed that driver reactions were
impaired by up to 20% for two hours after drinking, even though their
bloodstream levels were below the current legal limit.
Mr Spence added: ``Even a small amount of alcohol can have a detrimental effect
on drivers and serves to re-inforce the clear policy of Scottish police that
drinking and driving do not mix and there is no such thing as a safe limit as
far as consuming alcohol is concerned.
``Apart from the saving of human misery and grief by reducing the death toll in
drink-related incidents, there is the considerable financial incentive, bearing
in mind that the overall average cost to the taxpayer of a fatal accident in
Scotland is in the region of #860,000.''
Mr Spence, who is also the Chief Constable of Tayside Police, recommended that
the reduced limit be introduced hand-in-hand with a programme to educate
motorists about the effects of alcohol on their driving ability.
However, Scottish Roads and Transport Minister Lord James Doulgas Hamilton, who
was present at the launch, said that although drink-driving legislation was
under review, the Government had no current plans to change the legal limit.
He added: ``The present limit is set at the level above which drivers' chances
of an accident rise significantly. Most of those convicted are found to be two
times the legal limit or above, so our priority is too enforce that.''
The Scottish Campaign against Irresponsible Drivers (Scid) welcomed the police
initiative but called for drink-driving limits to be enforced through the
random testing of motorists. Co-chairwoman Isobel Brydie said: ``The vast
majority of people now see drink driving as socially unacceptable and are aware
of its consequences. We are now down to the hard core of drinkers who are
prepared to take the risk of not being caught. With random testing, they might
think twice.''
Police announced the first results of their festive drink-drive campaign, which
began on Friday and will be one of the longest yet, lasting 41 days.
Since the first campaign in 1986, the proportion of drivers stopped who failed
or refused an alcohol test has fallen from 18.8% to 2.3% in 1995.
However, during the first weekend of this year's campaign, the number of drink
drivers in Scotland was 133, a slight rise on the same period last year.
Strathclyde police reported a ``disappointing'' rise from 42 negative or
refused tests in 1994, to 53 this year.
The theme of the 1995 crackdown, ``Don't Drive - Dial'', will be featured on
20,000 posters and seven million business-style cards distributed across
Scotland.
Backing the campaign, Formula One racing driver David Coulthard said: ``As a
racing driver, I am more than aware of the dangers of when my mind isn't fully
alert and working.
``Because of drink driving, I feel more at risk on the open road than in the
controlled environment of a race circuit.''

DUNDEE manager Jim Duffy last night urged his defeated Coca-Cola Cup finalists:
``Learn from Hampden, and you can be winners next time.'' Player-manager Duffy
was bitterly disappointed when his first cup final appearance at the age of 36
ended in a 2-0 defeat by Aberdeen on Sunday.
But Duffy was determined to dwell only on the positive side as he reflected on
the aftermath of Dundee's first major occasion in 15 years.
He said: ``One thing we can all focus on is the fact that Iain Anderson was
involved in a cup final at 18, and Jim Hamilton at 19. Neil McCann and Paul
Tosh were also there at an early age, and even Morten Wieghorst is only 24.
``There is no doubt in my mind that these players, and others, will take part
in occasions like that because they have many years ahead of them - and because
Sunday's disappointment does not hide the fact that they are good players.
``What they must make certain of is that Hampden really does become part of the
learning process for them. A similar thing happened to me when I was a young
Celtic player.
``I had been doing well in reserve games for a while, but the manager had not
seen me because he had been with the first team on match days.
``But I knew Billy McNeill was going to be at a midweek Glasgow Cup-tie, and I
knew his assistant, Frank Connor, had been telling him how well I'd been doing.
``I let nerves get to me because of all that, and I          was hopeless in
the match. I couldn't play at all and ended up getting a roasting from the
manager.
``From that day on I made sure nerves would never get to me again, and I hope
my young players will go the same way after what happened to them against
Aberdeen.
``If it works for them, they will certainly go into their next final - whether
they are with Dundee or somewhere else - with a far better chance of winning.''
In the build-up to Hampden, Duffy had been confident his youngsters would not
take stage fright, but he admitted: ``Everything was fine in our camp until two
o'clock.
``It was when our bus drove down towards Hampden through all our own fans that
it suddenly got to the players just what responsibility they were carrying.''
Dundee's next final appearance could be some time away, but Duffy knows the
next stage of their learning process comes against St Mirren at Love Street on
Saturday when they try to recapture their form in the first division promotion
race.
They will go top of they beat Saints and follow it up with another three points
against Dumbarton at Dens next Tuesday. Their manager intends to give them a
vote of confidence, but will have to leave the rest to them.
He said: ``I won't be pushing to bring in new players basically because those
already here have proved they have the talent and are good professionals.
``But going to Paisley will be another test for them because for the first time
in two weeks they are not going to be the centre of attention for Scottish
football.
``We had a televised derby against Dundee United followed by all the media
involvement surrounding the final against Aberdeen. It is important that we
cope with that because of what's at stake for the club.''

Lynda Thomson's approach to stress is refreshingly different, says Eric Kennedy
IN these stressful days it's nice to meet someone with an alternative to
pill-popping. Aches and pains, whether physical or mental, are the speciality
of Lynda Thomson, and she has never given anyone a bottle of pills in her life.
Not that she would actively encourage people to give up painkillers. It's just
that she offers a different approach - via the increasingly popular method of
aromatherapy.
There is no doubt that large numbers of people are turning to alternative
methods of healing these days. Aromatherapy, or the use of essential oils and
massage in the treatment of the whole person as a unique individual, is one of
them.
These oils come from plants, leaves, petals, wood, bark and resins and are used
to treat a variety of ailments. These include headaches, rheumatism, arthritis,
anxiety, muscular and sinus problems, insomnia, depression, and migraine.
And Lynda, who works at the Health and Stress Clinic in Glasgow's Clarkston
Road, considers she is in a rewarding job, as she can see the difference they
make to her clients.
She wanted to be a TV make-up artist when she left Eastwood High in 1988 with
four 0-Grades. She went to Glasgow College of Commerce for a year to study
hairdressing, then to Clydebank College to do an HND in Beauty Therapy.
This was no lipstick-and-eyeshadow course: It involved the study of anatomy,
biology, chemistry, physics and psychology, as well as the practical aspects of
make-up, aromatherapy and reflexology.
Chemistry taught her about the ingredients of products, and biology about the
muscles, bones and skin. But it was aromatherapy which caught and held her
attention. It was based on methods thousands of years old and she knew it could
make a big difference to people's lives. After working in cosmetics for a time
she secured a job with the Health and Stress Clinic as an aromatherapist and
has since helped a wide variety of people, ranging in age from about 12 to 70.
Essential oils such as sandalwood, neroli and marjoram can have a powerful
effect on body and mind. These and other oils are made up of tiny molecules and
can penetrate as far as the bloodstream via massage. Other oils are highly
invigorating and the ``feel-good'' factor can be achieved through the use of
the proper substances in the proper way.
Lynda and the other staff can advise on this, after checking the patient's
medical records to ensure there is no blood-pressure or other problem. The oils
used at the clinic are undiluted and used with care. Some of them help
concentration, women's problems, and asthma.
Lynda has seen many people cut down on painkillers, sometimes abandoning them
completely, thanks to aromatherapy. The combination of essential oils and
massage makes use of two important senses - smell and touch - and she finds
that many cynics have been won over to it.
Lynda Thomson really enjoys her job. ``I like helping people,'' she says simply.
Courses for would-be aromatherapists and reflexologists are available at a
variety of colleges.

THE confessional state begins to reel. In 1937, assembling a new constitution
for the Irish Sovereign State, Eamonn de Valera not only inserted a specific
prohibition of divorce but confirmed the ``special position of the Holy
Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church as the guardian of the Faith professed by
the great majority of the citizens''.
The clause was dropped in 1972, as a sop to northern Unionists, but the reality
remained. The Irish had an establishment of religion, a national profession of
the Roman Church that the Italians deemed risible and the Spanish would have
thought distinctly over the top. To this day, the election of a Protestant MP
to the Dail is a novelty. Abortion is expressly outlawed in the constitution;
so - for the moment - is divorce.
It is typical of the fanaticism of a certain type of Roman Catholic that,
despite a recount confirming last week's referendum vote for divorce law
provision, legal challenges are to be mounted in the Dublin courts against the
reform. And it speaks volumes for Ireland's unique enthusiasm for Roman
Catholicism that the Pope himself took time out from being infallible to appeal
for a No vote in the referendum.
The Italians know how to keep him in his place. In Latin America, thousands are
deserting the old faith for evangelicalism. Ireland, poor and boggy as it is,
is by far the most faithful of all daughters of Mother Church.
The Roman Catholic Church runs most of Ireland's hospitals and virtually all
its teacher-training colleges. Over 90% of her citizens are Roman Catholic
adherents (a much higher proportion than at partition in 1922; but then,
hundreds of Protestants were bombed, burned, or frightened out of the Emerald
Isle). Such a position does not breed humility.
Only last week a bishop dramatically declared that Romanists who dared to
divorce or remarry, under reformed civil law, would not be entitled to the
sacraments of the Church. This must have given Father Brendan Smyth a good
laugh. Currently doing time in an Irish prison for multiple sex offences
against young boys, Smyth has not been excommunicated and still enjoys all
church privileges.
The trouble is that, in the Roman Church, marriage is exalted as a sacrament; a
holy and indissoluble bond, which cannot be broken without making a mockery of
the infallibility of the Church. Hence the traditional Roman solution to
marriage breakdown is not to sever the marital bond; it is the process of
annulment - to deny that a true marriage ever existed in the first place.
As all Roman sacraments are immensely complicated, it is remarkably easy to
annul a marriage, granted motivation. If the priest made one mistake; if one of
the partners subsequently admits to ``mental reservation'' - well, the thing
was void from the start, and the marriage never wrought in Heaven in the first
place.
The moral logic of this is odd. It declares the children of that annulled
marriage bastards and is a humiliation of the first order for a defending
party. Nevertheless, hundreds of Irish couples every year went by the annulment
road, for want of an alternative; under civil law in Ireland, this measure
meant nothing and, in strict letter, any subsequent marriages were bigamous.
But the state turned a blind eye. There were no prosecutions.
In typical ignorance, some officers of the American Christian right weighed in
to the Irish debate, lending funds and guidance to campaigners for a No vote.
In this they flew against common sense and reason - the intolerance of the
Irish divorce laws was a civil oppression on citizens not adhering to the Roman
Catholic faith and against Scripture itself. Divorce is an evil, but on
occasion a necessary one.
It is justified in a case of adultery, or desertion, and of brutality. The
victim of such outrage is the innocent party with an absolute right to divorce
from the covenant-breaking spouse, if only to safeguard her property rights or
physical safety. Even in Protestant circles, however, there is great debate
over this. Some evangelical sects, expecially those Dispensationalist bodies
who discount much of the Old Testament moral code, regard divorce as always and
absolutely wicked.
On the other hand, the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland - at least in the
earlier part of this century - seems to have regarded the divorce of an
adulterous partner as obligatory. I know of two instances, many years ago, of
male members suspended from communion because they had refused to ``put away''
wives caught in open scandal.
Divorce is too readily confused with separation. No law of Church and State can
compel a man and woman to live together when their relationship has
irretrievably collapsed and domestic life reduced to bitterness, recrimination,
heartache, and malice. The provision of divorce law is to enable subsequent
remarriage, while guarding against frivolous quitting of a relationship that
may be salvageable, and protecting the interests of innocent parties.
The present state of divorce law in Britain is regrettable - the need to prove
fault has gone, and with it the necessary protection of an innocent party. How
many men have been abandoned by an unfaithful woman, who then sets up home with
a toy-boy and proceeds to sue the wretched husband for all he has built? But
some divorce law is essential and, in its absence, as in modern Ireland, great
evil results, especially to women trapped in brutal and improvident marriages.
From the confessional state to the confessional Princess. I hesitate to add to
acres of newsprint spent on the Princess of Wales and her slick, self-pitying,
maudlin soulbaring on television last week. Perhaps the most unpleasant aspect
of the performance was her utter disregard for the feelings of her sons, whom
she hauled into the tale of woe at every opportunity, if only to flaunt her
prime political card. But I will tell you this for nothing; I will not again
call her a fool. And it was not she, it appears, who was first unfaithful nor
she who first hit the screens to bare the secrets of her marriage to the nation.
In this I agree with her. She does not want a divorce and in that her instincts
are sound. While the royal marriage has collapsed beyond any hope of
reconciliation, neither of these two beauties is likely to want - or, indeed,
be able - to marry again. For good or ill, Chuck and Di are business-partners
for life. And with their several houses, complete with domestic staff and
multiple bedrooms, it is hard to see any serious hardship. The weans are packed
off to good rigorous schools, with nothing to fear save buggery: mum and dad
remain irredeemably famous, and they can always send notes through the servants.

SCOTLAND could be in line for new jobs thanks to a movie-based board game.
The Reel To Reel Picture Show, invented by Scots film buff Sandy Cherry, is
this year's Christmas craze in North America.
The games are pre-sently being manufactured in Toronto but Mr Cherry, 50, and
his son Martin, 27, want to produce them in their home town of Arbroath.
Martin Cherry said: ``We are struggling to keep up with demand and would love
to have some sort of production facility in Arbroath. We have already looked at
sites and hope we can create jobs for local people.''
The game, for adults and children, features more than 12,000 questions on 1000
cards covering subjects from the early days of cinema to the latest Hollywood
stars.
Players have to collect miniature film reels on their way round the board
before they can go for an Oscar and win the game.

POLICE forensic experts have used fingerprint analysis to authenticate a
painting as the work of JMW Turner.
When the owners bought Landscape with a Rainbow it was coated in dirt.
Conservation work revealed faint traces of ink, apparently reading ``JM William
Turner'', on the back and the painting's style appeared to resemble Turner's.
However, the evidence was provided by a former supervisor of  the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police's fingerprint laboratory, and Mr John Manners of West
Yorkshire Police fingerprint department.
They compared a print on the work with another on a Turner in the Tate Gallery
and discovered they were identical. The painting goes on sale in London next
month and is expected to fetch up to #120,000.

SCOTTISH fish merchants are demanding that the Government steps in to ensure
they have continuity of supplies, warning of a jobs crisis because of the
catching sector.
They claim some fish quotas are already exhausted and say there has been ``bad
management'' by the producers' organisations.
They demanded that if the organisations cannot manage the situation, the
Government should take the responsibility away from them to safeguard 5000 jobs
in the North-east.
The catching sector retorted by saying that if the merchants stopped taking
``black fish'' - illegally caught over-quota fish - there would be no problem.
The row stepped up yesterday when some producers' organisations were stopped
from fishing for certain species, including cod, because they had caught their
annual quotas.
The merchants believe this action by the Government could be illegal and will
consider taking the issue to the European Court.
Mr Robert Milne, chief executive of the Scottish Fish Merchants' Federation
Ltd, said the situation was totally unacceptable: ``To be told in November that
some producers' organisations have exhausted their supplies of whiting, cod,
and saithe with four or five weeks to go cannot and will not be tolerated.''
He said the Government or EU would have to allow them to draw on some 1996
quota.
Mr Ian MacSween, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Organisation Ltd,
blamed the situation on the merchants for being prepared to buy ``black fish''.
The Scottish Office Fisheries Minister, Mr Raymond Robertson, refused to be
drawn into the row, saying individual organisations had responsibility for
managing their own quotas.

VULNERABLE Scots yesterday were urged to have their annual flu jab as fears
grew that England and Wales could soon face an epidemic of cases.
The advice came from Dr Iain Stewart, a consultant in public health medicine
for Greater Glasgow Health Board, who said vaccinations were important for the
elderly and those with chronic diseases.
Dr Stewart said there was no evidence of a Scottish epidemic, although a large
number of people had bad colds, flu-like illnesses, and gastric flu.
``We are not at a worrying level yet. But the worst time for real influenza is
mid-December, so time is running out for people who should have a jab.''
He said anyone suffering from a common cold should keep warm and drink plenty
of liquids. The doctor should be called only if a patient's temperature did not
stabilise after a few days, or if there was evidence of chest pains or
shortness of breath.
South of the Border, the Royal College of General Practitioners has reported a
sudden surge in flu cases, which last week reached 90 per 100,000 population.
The normal rate for this time of year is about 50.
Epidemic levels are not reached until 250 per 100,000 are ill with the virus.

Athens
GREEK Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, in hospital with pneumonia, took a
turn for the worse today and his health problems spread to his kidneys, a
hospital spokesman said.
Papandreou, 76, who spent most of last week on a respirator, was hooked up to a
dialysis machine yesterday, government sources said.
They said it would take two to three hours to know how he was responding to the
dialysis, which takes over the function of the kidneys to remove impurities
from the blood.
A hospital spokesman told reporters Papandreou's condition had deteriorated in
the afternoon and his kidneys were affected.
``In the afternoon hours, the prime minister has shown a worsening in his
breathing, which has affected his kidneys,'' the spokesman said.
A succession of socialist ministers visited the hospital after the announcement
and were awaiting more news after Papandreou's doctors finish their
consultations.
Dozens of reporters have camped outside the Onassis Centre, near the Athenian
coast, for the past week since Papandreou was admitted to the intensive care
unit last Monday with pneumonia.
He was put on a respirator on Tuesday but his condition improved slowly and he
was taken off the machine last Friday.
Doctors expressed their first real optimism at the weekend and by this morning
were predicting that Papandreou could resume his full duties in time.
They reported that he was able to sit up over the weekend and talk to his wife,
Dimitra Liani-Papandreou, 40, who has been living at the hospital.
A team of 13 doctors has been attending Papandreou, who has appeared frail
since his Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) won elections in October 1993.
He has been unable to put in a full day's work and has kept his travel to a
minimum.
Two specialists from the United States and Switzerland were arrived at the
weekend to join the medical team.
Even before his condition worsened, it was clear Papandreou would play no role
in the final preparation of the 1996 budget and he would be unable to represent
Greece at the European Union summit in Madrid in December.--Reuter

<HEADLINE>Demonstration as headmaster returns to school</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ANGRY mothers and fathers staged a demonstration yesterday as a headmaster went
back to school after being convicted of assaulting a pupil by gagging him with
sticky tape.
Parents and their children sealed off the two gates at the Falkirk school on
head teacher Alex Christie's first day back. Protesters brandished placards
saying ``Christie out'' and ``Christie is a criminal''.
However, the 47-year-old head teacher avoided a confrontation by slipping into
the school long before the parents arrived. He said later: ``It's good to be
back.''
Mr Christie said he was aware that there had been a ``small group of parents at
the gates'', adding: ``The janitor told me about it.''
He refused to comment further but, in a statement through his lawyers, said he
deeply regretted the incident and fully accepted that what he had done was
wrong. The statement added: ``He is grateful that he has been given the
opportunity to put this whole matter behind him.'' It said he was looking
forward to returning to the school, ``where he will continue to promote the
best interests of both the pupils and the school.
``He would like to thank his family, friends, and colleagues for the support
they have given him over the past nine months.''
Mr Christie was fined #350 at Falkirk Sheriff Court in June when he admitted
gagging a 10-year-old chatterbox boy in the classroom. He was later put on
probation by the General Teaching Council and last week education officials at
Central Regional Council found him guilty of ``gross misconduct''. However,
they let him keep his job.
Yesterday, one parent in the protest said: ``A lot of parents have put in to
have their children transferred from the school. The children don't want to go
back to school because of him. We don't see why our kids should have to move
school just because of him. He's the one who should go.''
The boy at the centre of the row was kept at home by his parents yesterday. His
mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: ``I knew nothing about
this demonstration.''
However, she admitted she kept her son from school on Mr Christie's first day
back in charge after nine months' suspension on full pay.
q A lot of the boy's school friends got an unexpected day off. A power failure
hit the school's heating system, forcing the head teacher to bring in portable
heaters. Mr Christie admitted: ``It's still pretty cold in here. Some of the
children have been allowed to leave.''

UPDATE
BLACKBURN pair Graeme Le Saux and David Batty were yesterday let off the hook
by UEFA after Italian referee Luigi Pairetto's official report. UEFA's observer
at the European Champions' League game against Spartak last Wednesday made only
a passing mention of it in his report. But UEFA disciplinary committee
spokesman Peter Limacher said: ``We will respect the referee's opinion that it
is not worthy of further action.
``The disagreement between the two players was mentioned by our delegate at the
match but we do not ask them to make recommendations.''
Blackburn confirmed that they have fined Le Saux and Batty for the incident and
hoped that it would close the door on the matter.
q.RANGERS, still savouring their victory over Hibernian at the weekend, are
looking forward to a double success in the capital when they travel to
Tynecastle on Saturday, writes Ken Gallacher.
And they look sure to move into that clash with Hearts with David Robertson,
Brian Laudrup, and Stuart McCall all fit again after having missed the match at
Easter Road.
Yesterday, manager Walter Smith still ruled out Ian Ferguson and Trevor Steven,
but said: ``Stuart McCall, who was injured, is likely to be okay again. And the
other two who missed out at Easter Road, Laudrup and Robertson, were out of
that game only because they needed to be spelled a little.
``They had both been out for a while, and then returned in major matches. It
was always going to be too much to ask them to play three games in six days.''
At Ibrox yesterday the club's former captain and manager, and now PRO, John
Greig, launched his video, and the producers announced that it was already set
to be one of the biggest sellers they had produced.
Advance orders have already hit 32,000 copies for the double issue production.

<TEXT>
THE man Rangers hope to have a say in their future goal-scoring exploits early
in the New Year is preparing to take centre stage at the Olympic Stadium in
Tokyo today.
Jardel, of Brazilian side Gremio, lines up against Ajax of Amsterdam. And it is
no surprise that the Dutchmen are favourities to win the World Club Cup. They
are unbeaten in their previous 65 matches.
Jardel, whose club have agreed a #2.5m deal with Rangers, impressed Ibrox
manager Walter Smith when he watched him against Sao Paulo. He has plundered 45
goals so far this year in all competitions.
Now he should join Rangers within the next month or so and it looks certain
that work permit problems won't affect the giant striker, who apparently has
dual nationality, like so many of his countrymen.
Only last week, Porto played five Brazilians against the French champions
Nantes in the Champions' League. All of them had Portuguese passports, and if
that also applies to Jardel, as seems certain, then he is a Common Market
resident and can play in Scotland without a work permit being necessary.
Gremio, tough and physical, rely on high crosses to Jardel, who, with strike
partner Paulo Nunes, has unlocked a few defences with neat one-twos.
Only defender Arilson, goalkeeper Darnlei, and midfielder Dinho, have any
Brazil caps although right-back Francisco Arce and central defender Catalino
Rivarola have numerous caps for Paraguay.
But what about Ajax?
They won this battle between the European and South American champions in 1972,
and start as clear favourites against the Brazilians, who lifted the cup in
1983.
Ajax arrive with widespread praises ringing in their ears after their
outstanding 2-0 demolition of Real Madrid in the Champions' League last
Wednesday.
Real's manager Jorge Valdano said afterwards: ``Ajax are not just the team of
the 90s, they are approaching football's Utopia.
``Their concept of the game is exquisite, yet they have a physical superiority
as well. They are Beauty and the Beast.''
Only one player over the age of 25 - defender Danny Blind - is likely to play
for Ajax today, and their strike force, which has already scored 55 goals in
only 15 league games, could give the Brazilian defence a torrid time.
Ajax evoke memories of the Netherlands' ``total football'' philosophy of the
1970s, with attackers, midfielders, and defenders all ready to move into any
position, making runs and space for each other.
And with players like teenager Patrick Kluivert, who scored the European
Cup-winning goal against Milan, Marc Overmars, Nigerian Finidi George, and
lethal Finn Jari Litmanen spearheading the attack, Ajax can create and score
goals from anywhere.
There's also a different approach to this final from each team.
While Ajax have mixed light training with cultural visits in the Japanese
capital, Gremio have been moaning to the Brazilian press about Ajax having
better training facilities.
But that will not bother Louis Van Gaal's youngsters who have swept all before
them in Europe this season, culminating in their Champions' Cup victory over AC
Milan in Vienna in May.
Van Gaal has few injury worries, but the signs of a strenuous fixture-list are
beginning to tell on his relatively small squad, with international defender
Frank de Boer a doubt.
Van Gaal is aware that Gremio have a reputation as a tough, physical side, but
is not expected to change his team's style of play.
``We cannot afford to let them upset our rhythm. They are a tough side that
always attacks the opposition. They'll be very hard to break down,'' he said.
Gremio are not worried that Ajax are hot favourites. ``Barcelona and Milan also
turned their noses up at us, thinking they had everything won,'' Dinho said
referring to when he played for Sao Paulo.
Jardel said: ``You win football on the field.''

RACING:
JODAMI, the 1993 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, preserved his 100% record at Kelso
yesterday, when he landed the Hinchliffe Champion Chase, but it was no easy
victory for the 2-9 favourite.
It was Jodami's fourth visit to the Borders track, and his fourth success, but
Pink Gin, a 25-1 outsider, put in a tremendous challenge on the long, uphill
climb to the post and went down by only three-quarters of a length.
Patiently ridden in third place by Mark Dwyer, Jodami hit the front at the last
fence and appeared to be cruising to an easy victory until the last two hundred
yards.
Trainer Peter Beamont, who took Jodami out of Saturday's Hennessy Gold Cup in
favour of the Kelso race, admitted it had been ``a very close thing. It's a
long run to the line and he tends to idle when in front.''
Jodami will now probably go to Haydock for the Tommy Whittle Chase before
turning out on Boxing Day in the Rowland Meyrick at Wetherby.
Rocket Run (7-1) gave Lucinda Russell her fifth winner in her first season when
the former Welsh point-to-point champion was successful in the Jack Britton
Memorial Novices Chase.
Island Chief, the 1-3 favourite, held a commanding lead when he blundered and
fell at the fence in front of the stands on the second circuit.
Rocket Run, a #26,000 purchase by the trainer's father, Peter Russell, was left
in the lead and ran on well to beat Banntown Bill (9-1), trained by Martin Pipe
in Somerset.
The success ended a frustrating run without a winner for Russell, who trains at
Kinross. She is now in second place in The Herald Scottish Trainers'
Championship behind Peter Monteith, who leads on 12.
Penny-a-Day, the 1-5 favourite in the second division of the John Hogg Novices
Hurdle, made several mistakes and blundered badly at the last flight, but he
was still too fast for Supreme Soviet, who was beaten by seven lengths.
q MANDARINA had to settle for third place behind 226-10 outsider Passionnee and
Ludgate in the Prix Isola Bella at Saint Cloud yesterday.
Luca Cumani's filly attempted to make all, under Frankie Dettori, in the one
mile event, but was beaten a neck and half a length by the duo.

<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975159380</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Guinness affair is heading for a final showdown in the European Court of
Human Rights after a Court of Appeal ruled yesterday that Ernest Saunders and
his three co-defendants were rightly convicted five years ago of taking part in
an illegal share support operation.
Saunders has already won a preliminary decision from the Human Rights
Commission which states that the way the case was investigated deprived him of
fundamental safeguards against self-incrimination.
The former Guinness chairman confirmed after yesterday's crushing defeat that
the case would go to Strasbourg early next year ``where I am confident I will
obtain the fair hearing I seek''.
Heron International chief Gerald Ronson, stockbroker Anthony Parnes, and
management consultant Jack Lyons may follow suit if they fail to obtain
permission to take the case to the House of Lords.
The European court is to consider argument that Saunders was robbed of his
criminal law ``right to silence'' by being subjected to a ``draconian'' civil
law inquisition at the hands of Department of Trade and Industry inspectors
over a prolonged period before the police were finally brought in.
The inspectors can require suspects, on pain of sanctions including
imprisonment, to make potentially self-incriminating statements.
However, that argument found no favour with the Court of Appeal.
The three appeal judges, headed by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor, said
the UK Parliament had overriden such rights in the case of complex company
fraud and it was ``contrary to common sense'' to suggest that the prosecuting
authorities should not make proper use of the inspectors' investigative powers.
The judges said that, if Saunders won in the European Court, consideration
would have to be given to the effect of the decision in the UK. ``But our duty
at present is to apply our domestic law, which is unambiguous.''
The four men were convicted by an Old Bailey jury after a 112-day trial of
unlawfully creating a false market in Guinness shares during the company's
ultimately successful takeover battle with Argyll for the Scottish drinks group
Distillers.
Sir Jack Lyons was fined #3m and later stripped of his knighthood. He was the
only one of the four to gain anything out of yesterday's judgment - one of the
conspiracy convictions against him was quashed, entitling him to a #500,000
refund on his fine.
The other three defendants have served sentences at Ford open prison in Sussex.
Rejecting argument that the use of the DTI inspectors was unfair, the judges
said: ``The suggestion that these astute men, advised by experienced lawyers,
were, to use counsels' phrases, lulled into a false sense of security or
unaware of the peril of their position, is in our view fanciful.''
The court also dismissed a claim that the four were prejudiced by the
prosecution's non-disclosure of evidence which, it was argued, went to show
that what they did was not dishonest and was accepted City practice at the time.
At the end of their judgment, which took three hours to deliver, the judges
said: ``The combination of indemnities paid by Guinness to purchasers of its
own shares, the false invoices, the huge success fees, and the failure to
disclose either indemnities or success fees even to the Guinness board,
provided ample evidence of a dishonest scheme in which all the appellants
played their parts.
``In our view, the jury was well justified in finding them all to have acted
dishonestly.''

Paris
STRIKING railway workers crippled French train travel for the fourth day today
as Prime Minister Alain Juppe faced a new wave of stoppages over his austerity
plans.
Rail workers announced their strike, over restructuring and pension plans,
would go on into tomorrow after the failure of latest talks with the government.
Two big unions have also called a general strike for tomorrow over state
welfare reforms, while striking students demanding more funds for education
plan a protest on Thursday.
France's industrial turmoil was widely seen as the price the Juppe government
must pay for six months of reluctance to take sensitive decisions.
Rail workers' leaders said in meeting Labour Minister Jacques Barrot today they
had received no guarantee that pension schemes allowing them to retire early
would be safeguarded.
``Another meeting for nothing,'' said CFDT rail union leader Bruno Dalberto
after the talks.
Tomorrow, the state rail network SNCF is due to announce a carrot-and-stick
restructuring plan.
SNCF said the strike would halt all commuter trains in the Paris region and
severely disrupt traffic on high-speed main lines and regional services.
Only one in six main-line trains ran today.-Reuter.

THE 11 Lewis chess pieces in Scottish possession are expected to be shown in
Stornoway again next year.
At a meeting in Edinburgh yesterday, the trustees of the National Museums of
Scotland told a delegation from Western Isles Islands Council they intended to
make a further loan of the 11 pieces, which they own, to the new Western Isles
Museum in Lewis in 1996.
The likelihood of this happening was reported by The Herald on October 12. All
67 Lewis chess pieces, the British Museum owns the other 56, are on exhibition
at the Royal Scottish Museum until January 12.
At yesterday's meeting, which was described in a statement as ``very useful'',
the trustees said the initial loan of the chess pieces to the Western Isles
Museum during last summer had been a great success and they intended to build
on this positive outcome.
They intended to loan other archaeological pieces with Western Isles origins to
the Stornoway museum.
The arts and leisure committee of the islands council has said that the Lewis
chess pieces should be displayed permanently in the Western Isles.
The trustees of the British Museum are considering their attitude to their 56
pieces and have not reached a final decision.

STOKE City manager Lou Macari yesterday escaped with a warning after the
Football Association found him guilty of rude remarks to a referee.
The former Celtic manager was charged with bringing the game into disrepute
after he confronted Worcester official Gerald Ashby at half-time in Stoke's
Coca-Cola Cup tie against Newcastle on October 25. Ashby had sent off Stoke's
Ian Cranson following two bookable offences.
A spokesman for the FA said: ``Lou Macari has been severely censured and warned
as to his future conduct. He has also been ordered to give a written
undertaking that he will not repeat the offence and must pay part of the costs
of the hearing.''
Last week the FA decided to take no action against Wimbledon manager Joe
Kinnear following his reported criticism of referee Paul Alcock, who sent off
Vinnie Jones against Nottingham Forest.

A PLAN to dispense ``designer beers'' from vending machines in public bars was
rejected unanimously yesterday by Edinburgh District Council's licensing board.
Tennent Caledonian Breweries wanted to operate the scheme for a trial period in
four city centre pubs.
Branded products, such as Gold Bier, would be on sale in 33cl bottles. The
company claimed the idea was meant to reduce waiting time at bars and said the
machines were in operation in England.
Lothian and Borders Police said there had been no difficulties down south but
emphasised they were situated in member-only clubs, such as bingo clubs, which
operated an over-18 policy.
The police added that a machine dispensing bottled beer in a licensed disco in
Bathgate had to be removed because of under-age drinking and attempts to steal
money.
The Campaign for Real Ale also told the board the machines would be potential
trouble points which could reduce pubs to the      level of amusement arcades.
Mr Andrew Wilson, solicitor for the brewery, said it was prepared to instal the
machine in only one outlet for a trial period - La Belle Angele in the Cowgate.
Moving rejection, Councillor Michael Pringle, said that on a recent visit to
the Emergency Unit at the Royal Infirmary he had been told that admissions
could be reduced by 50% if bottle and glasses could be done away with.
Introducing these machines would be a ``retrograde step'' and he described the
idea as ``absolutely crazy'' and said it would lead to ``people wandering about
with bottles in their hands to use as weapons''.

PEOPLE in Sutherland looking for a way through Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's tax
maze Budget are being offered a helping hand by a new business venture.
With the aid of a business start-up package from Caithness and Sutherland
Enterprise, tax expert Jill Gordon has set up the area's first specialist
consultancy aimed at businesses and the general public.
A member of the Association of Taxation Technicians and an associate of the
Chartered Institute of Taxation, Ms Gordon has more than 25 years' experience
in her field.
She said: ``Tax can be a nightmare for people and it is easy to get confused
and end up making costly mistakes. There are major changes coming into the tax
system in 1997 when we all have to deal with the new rules for self-assessment.
``This is the biggest change in the UK system in 50 years and I think it will
hit the self-employed the hardest.
``Bearing in mind the large number of self-employed in the area and the current
lack of specialist advice to businesses in general, I felt there was an
opportunity to put my expertise and experience to good use.
``Chartered Accountants have traditionally done this kind of work but most
firms are too small to have a taxation expert on their staff for such a
specialised field so I won't be competing with them.''
Ms Gordon will be offering advice on all aspects of tax, especially income tax
and PAYE, also corporation tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax, VAT and
stamp duty.
As well as having financial assistance from CASE, Ms Gordon has also taken part
in a series of business start-up skills courses hosted by the enterprise
company, part of the Highlands and Islands Enterprise network.
Alistair Kennedy, who is head of business development for CASE and is based at
the enterprise company's new office at Golspie, said: ``I don't think any of us
like paying tax but it is a fact of life.
``What Jill Gordon will be doing is helping individuals and businesses through
the taxation maze thus providing an important new addition to the range of
professional services available in Caithness and Sutherland.''

MORTON manager Allan McGraw surprised his players yesterday when he walked back
into Cappielow. But McGraw smiled and said: ``I`m fit and well. In fact, when I
went into the paper shop this morning on the way here, the assistant stared at
me. I said: `It's all right, I'm not a ghost.'''
McGraw was rushed to hospital on Saturday during the two-goal win over
Dunfermline complaining of chest pains. He remained in hospital until late
Sunday.
The Morton manager added: ``I must admit I thought I was having a heart attack,
and I am relieved the cardiograph readings have shown that was not the case.
The medical experts have also told me if I had been suffering from stress that
would have shown up as well. But there was no sign of that, and I know I am not
suffering from it.
``I had trouble with my stomach last week, and that's what it was.''
McGraw did not put in his usual long hours at the park yesterday, but his aim
is quickly to return to his normal work routine even though he will have
further tests carried out .
q.THE SFA will take another major step today to give the green light for TV
evidence to be heard in disciplinary cases.
The Executive Committee, headed by SFA president Bill Dickie, which decides on
major policy changes, will meet in Glasgow this morning.
And the committee will have in front of it a recommendation from the
Disciplinary Committee that the present policy should be altered.
The move for change was started two weeks ago by the premier division
representatives on the Scottish League Management Committee.

Geraldine Abrahams looks at an innovative programme that offers new steps up
the ladder for middle-management females
DESPITE the fact that they make up more than half of the workforce in Scotland
today, research shows that women in industry receive less training and
development than their male counterparts.
While so much is written and discussed about the Glass Ceiling and how women
have great difficulty in reaching the higher echelons of senior management, the
problem is not isolated to that level alone.
When Motherwell District Council decided to support and jointly fund - with
Lanarkshire Development Agency - the ``Women Mean Business'' programme earlier
this year, it was clear from the start that it was aiming at a level which was
likely to be more effective in the local business environment.
``As a funder, the council believes it is important to create more women in
middle management as role models for the working women of the District,''
explains Maureen McConachie of Motherwell District Council's Business
Development Unit. ``And it's felt that this programme will achieve that in the
longer term. It adopts an innovative approach to developing women in the
workplace.''
The five-month-long programme was first developed by Yvonne Brown, projects
manager for Abrach Associates, in response to a request by Strathclyde Regional
Council to create a programme for women in business.
The pilot programme was run by the Gorbals Initiative and targeted local
companies. It was designed to develop the skills of key female members of staff
through projects which would relate to and benefit those companies.
Following its success, Yvonne Brown approached Motherwell District Council and
the programme was launched in March of this year and completed in August. A
third programme is already underway at East Kilbride.
Eleven women took part in the Motherwell programme, representing companies of
varying size, established and new, from the retailing, manufacturing and
service industries. Those companies participating in the programme were invited
to identify where development work in their organisation would make a
significant positive impact on performance - and to propose female staff
members with the greatest development potential to carry out a project, under
direct supervision.
``It was a question of matching my skills with those of the women involved to
produce something of value not only to them but to the companies for which they
work'' says Yvonne Brown. ``I worked on a one-to-one basis, setting tasks each
week, working towards an end-goal, and this was punctuated with workshops where
there was a sharing of information. At the end of the programme, the women all
produced written or verbal presentations.''
Apart from the obvious benefits to the companies in terms of the project work
tackled and their employees' improved performance, the personal development of
the women themselves has been most noticeable.
Jane Pow first heard about the Women Mean Business programme when the company
for which she works, BOC Gases, was approached and invited to become involved.
As an administrator, Jane's project was to expand the database on which she was
working, focusing on the medical sector, from which the company's draws its
most valueable customers.
These range from the manufacturing giants to small independent users. BOC Gases
is the leading supplier of medical gases to the NHS, pharmacists, the emergency
services, and domiciliary patients.
The project involved contacting 12 hospitals in Lanarkshire as well as some of
the larger Glasgow hospitals. While she had experience in compiling the
database, she had no face-to-face experience.
``By the time I had completed the exercise, I had conversed face-to-face for
half-an-hour with the chief pharmacists at 12 hospitals,'' she says. ``I took
along a questionnaire which I had compiled with Yvonne's help, and asked
questions that would indicate the levels of satisfaction of service from BOC
Gases.
``I also brought a contact sheet and various promotional/ information materials
from the company. There was plenty of feedback, most of it positive, and I took
my findings back to the company.''
Several meetings followed, at which she reported on her findings - and the
recommendations have since been implemented.
Jane was surprised and impressed with the results. She found, after two months,
that she was able to respond more quickly and efficiently and, as she gained
confidence and experience, became better prepared for each interview. She is
now more aware of what the company is about and feels she is a more valuable
member of staff as a result of her exercise.
Her employers have been delighted with the work she has done in gathering the
information and liaising with the clients - so much so that she received a #100
cheque as a reward for her excellent work on the report.
Jacqueline Brown is also an administrator, although with a much smaller
locally-based company - Uppermost Shoes of Motherwell which has 25 shops, a
number of which are franchised to former employees. She carries out
administration for all the shops in the group and compiles statistical reports
on sales for the company as a whole.
She decided to do her project on marketing since it was an area of which she
had no knowledge, but one which she felt would be relevant to the business. She
focused on three shops and, with Yvonne's help, made out customer survey
reports for each.
This was the first time she had actually worked at the front edge of the
business - where sales were carried out - and she had feedback which she
subsequently analysed.
Although she was apprehensive at first, her employer, Brian McKeown, was very
keen. ``We all get caught in the treadmill of doing our own jobs and very
seldom get the chance to do anything different,'' he says, ``so it was a great
opportunity for Jacqueline to become involved in a marketing exercise.
`It has broadened her whole perspective, increased her ability and confidence.
Jacqueline was a highly competent administrator anyway, but she didn't see the
sharp end of the business, the decision processes. This gave her the chance to
develop new skills.
``This has been good for the business and good for Jacqueline's own
self-esteem. When something new is introduced to the company, she is now
prepared to put forward ideas - that came directly from doing the report - and
has also managed to make sense of all the information stored on the computer,
understanding its implications.''
Both Motherwell District Council and Lanarkshire Development Agency have been
delighted with the positive response from the 11 locally-based companies. Andy
McNab, enterprise development manager, says: ``It is important that women are
encouraged to take up management positions within local businesses and we
believe that this programme, which we have funded with Motherwell District,
gives women excellent training and business assistance which will not only help
them further their own skills but also help the firms for which they work.''

ONCE again the annual orgy of the publication of exam results has produced
acres of copy in all of the Scottish papers, tabloids as well as broadsheets.
Of course, The Herald tries to do things in a civilised way. It refuses to
order the schools into ``league tables'' and it makes sure that the comment
which accompanies the figures is balanced. The headteachers - usually of the
``successful'' schools - are quick to point to the deficiencies of the figures;
the ``experts'' remind us of the need to try to measure ``added value'' rather
than raw results; and we are reminded of the impact of socio-economic factors.
But, nevertheless, the figures invite conparision, and uninformed comparisons
in this case are certainly odious.
If these figures are geniunely part of the Scottish Office Education and
Industry Department's drive for a ``quality culture'' then surely they must,
above all else, avoid misleading the very public at whom they are aimed?
The Standard Grade examations have been with us for a decade and a half, and
the Government has spent considerable time and effort to educate the public
about the meanings of Foundation, General and Credit. What can be the possible
justification, therefore, for the press concentrating only on Grades 1-4? Do
grades 5 and 6 not matter? Is the impression to be given that they represent
``failure'' - a word we were told had disappeared from the examination
vocabulary at Standard Grade.
Theoretically, all young people are able to achieve at their own level. But, it
seems, some achievements are more valued than others. Indeed, this culture of
failure has permeated the way the young people themselves, and even some
teachers, view Standard Grade.
If achievement of a 5 or 6 does not even merit a mention in the press, will
``parity of esteem'' - the claim which underpins the Government's Higher Still
proposals - ever be anything other than a pipe dream? And it is not enough to
blame the press for this distortion. The very basis of the publication of these
results must be seriously questioned.
And what of the young people in many of our inner-city schools who, faced with
the prospect of unemployment, nevertheless complete their course work and turn
up for their Foundation and General examinations?
One school in Strathclyde, after a concerted push, halved the number of No
Awards at Standard Grade last year. Why doesn't that fact merit a mention?
Many such schools have introduced initiatives such s Supported Study to tackle
under-achievement, and yet none of these contextual factors appear. We seem
intent of valuing what we can measure rather than measuring what we value.
No-one doubts that exam results are important for pupils, and that for some
they may provide a passport for success in later life. But does success in
exams equal learning, and should we not be trying to reward a wide range of
achievements by young people in our schools?
Should it not be incumbent upon those who produce these figures to set them in
a context, to include factors which are known to influence examination results?
It is surely important for parents to know if they are comparing like with like
as they peruse these figures, if indeed that is what they do, in preparation
for the choice they will make of the school to which to send their children.
Many years ago when the-then Glasgow Herald ran its own version of exam league
tables, there appeared an article citing advice from a right-wing think-tank to
parents. They were advised to read the schools' handbooks and count the number
of times the word ``caring'' appeared - it would be in inverse proportion to
the academic excellence of the school! If we are not prepared to include
contextual factors, we may be in danger of giving credence to such a limited
view of schools.
If socio-economic status - or ``class'' - is a key determinant of success, as
the research in Scotland and in other parts of the world suggests, why is there
no indication in these figures of the balance of the schools' intake?
It can be done. Strathclyde Region has done it for a number of years now, and
there is evidence that south of the Border a similar approach is being
considered. Using this approach it is possible to predict, using indicators
such as free school meals, clothing grants and other factors, the likely
attainments of young people - and it can help determine if schools are
achieving more or less well than expected.
If the aim of publishing examination results is to help improve schools, then
surely an approach which leads to their conversion into league tables is not
the way to do it. Instead, we need to look at the factors which seem to be
associated with the progress that pupils make.
The things which schools do, day in and day out, to create an ethos of
achievement, to raise pupils' self-esteem, to challenge negative peer-group
pressure and to break the cycle of disadvantage should be published, celebrated
and made accessible to the public. The big stick of published examination
results will not, in itself, make schools better.
What is needed is a commitment from the Government to ensure that
accountability is a positive force, enabling schools to self-evaluate and to
learn from good practice elsewhere. Indeed, it is a tribute to schools and
local authorities that they have rejected the Government's competition message
and tried to use more sophisticated analyses of exam results to help them
improve practice at classroom level.
I remember being in a school in November, 1994, just after the publication of
results, when a pupil asked the headteacher in a corridor: ``Sir, is our school
rubbish?'' It certainly wasn't - but you couldn't have told that from its exam
results.
If we could agree nationally that the commitment to raising levels of
achievement should not be an ideological football, and that allegiance to the
market and competition needs to be balanced by investment in positive action
and collaborative approaches, then we might spare ourselves this annual flurry
and get on with the real task of promoting achievement for all.

Strathclyde University, Glasgow.
Without contextual factors, exam tables are worthless, writes BRIAN BOYD

CALEDONIAN Media Communications is buying equipment from Israel to set up a
hi-tech radio telephone network in Glasgow that will compete with British
Telecom.
The Aberdeen-based cable television and telecommunications company yesterday
signed a contract to buy #800,000 of equipment for setting up local transmitter
bases from Israel's Tadiran Communications.
Tadiran will also supply digital radio equipment for installation at client
sites for a guaranteed period of five years.
Chief executive Graham Duncan said a further contract for several million
pounds worth of telephone switching gear would be signed ``within a few
weeks'', but he declined to identify the supplier.
Caledonian has received several approaches from investors keen to buy into the
telecommunications venture, which will cost between #5m and #10m to set up. But
it is putting off talks with selected investors until the first quarter of 1996.
Last June Caledonian completed the #850,000 purchase of Atlantic
Telecommunications after that company gained a public telecommunications
licence for Strathclyde.
Caledonian plans to use this licence to set up a fixed-link radio telephone
network covering 1.3 million people in the greater Glasgow area early next
year. This will use radio links between client sites and a series of local
transmitter stations instead of fixed wires.
Caledonian's radio technology is based on systems designed for military use and
is much more secure than that used by mobile phones, which often suffer from
eavesdropping and interference.
``Our main targets are small and medium-sized businesses, but the network will
have domestic subscribers in it as well,'' Mr Duncan said.
Caledonian hopes the telecommunications venture will show a return within three
years, much less than the seven to nine-year period associated with its
investments in cable television in Aberdeen and Coventry.
Its telephones will be linked to a small flat aerial, the size of an A4 sheet
of paper. These will interface with a Caledonian local transmitter.
It plans to start pilot commissioning the system in the first quarter of next
year.

A HEADTEACHER yesterday sought to allay the fears of concerned parents after a
15-year-old girl pupil at his school was found to have meningitis.
Mr George Bone, head of Marr College in Troon, wrote to the parents of almost
1500 pupils informing them of the details of the illness affecting the
teenager, whose condition is now stable and who is recovering at home.
He wrote that ``rumours had been spreading like wildfire'' since two other
pupils displayed symptoms associated with the infection. A hospital check-up
astablished that both had colds.
The original case has been diagnosed as meningococcal septicaemia which - while
common - can be serious and can in certain circumstances spread quickly through
the patient's peer group.
The fourth-year pupil was treated at Ayrshire Central Hospital and released
after a number of days to recuperate at home.
Symptoms of the infection include headaches, vomiting, stiff neck, tiredness,
irritability, and sensitivity to bright light.
Dr Paul McKee, public health consultant with Ayrshire and Arran Health Board,
said: ``I can confirm one case at Marr College. All the proper procedures have
been followed by the school in consultation with ourselves. There have been no
subsequent cases discovered.''
Mr Bone has told parents: ``I fully understand the anxiety shown by parents and
I wish to reassure all concerned that the situation is being monitored closely
and appropriate action will be taken as necessary.
``In the unlikely event of further developments, parents will be kept fully
informed.''
Mr Christopher Scott, 18, from Falkirk, a first-year student at Stirling
University, was still critically ill last night after contracting meningitis
last week.

IN the run-up to the festive season, many final-year students and recent
graduates have more on their minds than gift-filled stockings and Christmas
puddings. The search for a job when they finish their degree is now on. For
them it is also the season of careers fairs, the milk round and application
forms.
Although employment opportunities for graduate are beginning to improve after
five years of decline, there has been no return to the recruitment measures of
the late 1980s.
In the past, the milk round was the main source of graduate recruitment. This
was the annual autumn and spring tours by companies to campuses across the
country which focused on presentations outlining the opportunities they had.
During the rounds they also held interviews for potential employees.
But things are different now. The milk round is proving ideal for neither
employers nor students. The increase in the number of universities has meant
that the milk round has become time-consuming and expensive for employers.
Changes in course timetabling mean that it has also become inconvenient for
some students.
Jennifer Anderson, 22, graduated from Strathclyde University last summer.
During her final year she hardly had time to hunt for jobs. ``My dissertation
was due at the same time as the milk round was happening,'' she remembers. ``I
didn't have time to commit myself to filling out application forms properly.''
According to Lochart Madden at the careers service at Aberdeen University:
``Companies are active but in different ways.'' One of these ways is careers
fairs which have grown in prominence in recent years. At these events employers
hold stalls where students can come and get information on a wide range of
companies. They are also a way for employers to reach a vast number of students.
Barbara Graham is director of Strathclyde University's careers service, which
organises the annual Scottish Careers Fair. ``This fair is the only one in
Scotland open to all students, and employers have tended to be very helpful in
their response,'' she says.
Telecommunications giant AT&amp;T has been attending the Scottish Careers Fair for
many years. For the company, Alex Cowe says: ``Fairs are important as they
allow students to profile themselves and they give us the opportunity to catch
special people.''
One of the more popular stalls at this year's fair was the retailer Next. Its
graduate recruitment officer is 23-year-old Harry Harpur. He got his job
through a year's placement with the company, which he had to do as part of his
degree.
This is the first year that Next has gone to graduate fairs and it will be
attending five or six careers fairs throughout the UK. ``This is a brand new
approach,'' says Harry. ``Previously, as a desirable company, Next received
lots of speculative applications. We were not interested in that at all this
year.''
Scott Mathieson, 23, is a final year student at Glasgow University. ``The fair
has been very useful,'' he says. However, he isn't going to put all his eggs in
one basket. Aside from paying it a visit, he also plans to send off his CV to
many smaller companies not represented at the fair. His attitude is one that
Barbara Graham would like to cultivate among other job hunters. ``The
philosophy that tells graduates that they have to join a big corporation has
got to change.
``Smaller companies may only need a graduate once in a blue moon. Through
building links with them we can educate these employers so that when this
opportunity comes up, the first people they come to is us.''
Careers services are also training students to promote themselves more
effectively. At Aberdeen, Lochart Madden is working in a very different way
than three years ago. ``One of the things we now do is run workshops in areas
of common interest such as interview techniques.''
Alex Cowe has definitely noticed a change in student attitudes in recent times.
``They are much more focused in giving a quick precis of what they think you
need. It wasn't so in the past. They have obviously been well prepared by their
careers services.''
Carol Adam, 22, graduated from Strathclyde with a degree in Marketing and
Business Law last summer. She now works for PA Consulting Group in London as a
consultant analyst. ``I fancied consultancy work and thought I'd concentrate on
applying for work in that area first. I went to the careers office and they
helped me work out a strategy for finding a job.
``A lot of people think that they can't get a job without using the milk round.
I didn't use it at all.''
Times have changed, says student SARAH URQUHART (below).Now there are more ways
for graduate talent to be noticed than through big firms' annual campus tours

<HEADLINE>BTR hives off Tilcon to Minorco in #330m deal</HEADLINE>

BTR is pulling out of UK aggregates with the sale of its Tilcon subsidiary to
mining finance house Minorco for #330m. The deal involves 180 sites around the
country, of which 45 are in the Scottish central belt, producing sand and
gravel, drystone, coated stone, mortar, ready mixed concrete and other quarry
products. The business employs 2300 people.
The deal reflects BTR's policy of concentrating on industrial manufacturing.
The proceeds will be used to reduce debt. In 1994, Tilcon made profits of #24m
and assets were worth #180m. It expects to earn #29m this year.
BTR chief executive Alan Jackson commented: ``We believe that the sale to
Minorco, an international natural resources group with operations in Europe,
North America and South America, will form a strong basis for the Tilcon
business going forward.''
The company operates mainly in the West Midlands, the north of England and
Scotland where, in each region, it is market leader. It produces 14.5 million
tonnes of aggregates annually and this will about double Minorco's existing UK
production capacity. There is little overlap with Minorco's existing operations
which consist of the Buxton Lime ``superquarry'' and the Nash Rocks quarry on
the Welsh border.
Minorco chief executive Hank Slack explained the company had been eyeing Tilcon
for some time in the context of expanding its European aggregates operation.
With purchases in Germany and Spain, it has now spent #640m in developing this
business to help offset the cyclical nature of other parts of the group.
The latest deal ``achieves our objective for expanding the division to an
appropriate size, given the current and planned developments within our mining
divisions,'' said Mr Slack.
Minorco remains on the lookout for further purchases, mainly in the countries
where it is already operating.

AS a business tool the mobile phone has long since proved its worth, no van
delivery business would be without one, and it is now perceived as more of an
essential than an expensive or unnecessary toy for the businessman. But the
swing has since moved from the business consumer to the private consumer
perhaps fuelled by lower tariffs and the vast range of choice and price of
mobiles available.
In an emergency a mobile phone could clearly be a lifesaver. In a less extreme
situation it could provide a vital link for help. And for the woman driver
whose car has broken down the mobile can be a comforting device as well as
providing assurance that isolation is likely to be short-lived.
Mobile phones are small and light enough to be carried in the pocket or
handbag. Most have a memory function where names and numbers can be programmed
into the phones. And many can scroll through the last 20 or so numbers dialled.
Other features include a timer funtion that lets you see precisely the number
of units you have used and a lock facility to prevent unauthorised users making
calls unless in an emergency 999 call.
Before you buy make sure you study the contract thoroughly and that you
understand the basis on which charging is made. The phone you buy may be cheap
but the calls you make could be expensive and you may also be tied into a
contract.
Basic points that are also worth considering before you go mobile are whether
the phone has a hands-free car kit available, clear audibility, good fringe
performance and good battery capacity.

YOU will recall the stooshie at the Glasgow concert hall when city boss Pat
Lally decided that the murals by Ian McCulloch should be removed.
McCulloch, just as cussed a bloke as Mr Lally, continues his rearguard action
to have his art restored to the concert hall walls.
Glasgow City Council has embarked on its Festival of Visual Arts '96 and
invited artists to apply for funding for works and events. Mr McCulloch thought
it would be entirely appropriate for the city to rescind Mr Lally's unilateral
consignment (or should that be consignation - so difficult this English
language) of his two huge paintings from the concert hall to a storeroom at the
Tramway gallery in the south side of the city.
Being used to municipal bureaucracy, Mr McCulloch submitted a proper prospectus
for his project detailing a budget of #450 to restore his paintings to the
locus as selected by the committee originally set up to choose the art for the
concert hall. This includes an element of refurbishment since the basic and
damp accommodation at the Tramway has not done the paintings much good in the
interim.
In his application, Mr McCulloch describes as the aim of his project: ``To
redress a brutal act of censorship and by so doing, go some way to re-establish
the good name of the City of Glasgow in cultural affairs.''
Despite the paltry sum of money involved, Mr McCulloch has not had a very
encouraging response to his application. This may or may not have anything to
do with the fact that, until April next year when a new unitary authority takes
over, Glasgow remains under the fiefdom of that well-known art critic and city
boss, Patrick J Lally.
Show of hands
LORD James Douglas-Hamilton, Scottish Office Minister in charge of crime, among
other duties, is renowned for the slow but sure delivery of his speeches.
Usually done with a finger following the text in the best traditions of a
primary three pupil in a reading test.
Thus it was that those in attendance at a Scottish Office ``Business Crime
Reduction Strategy Launch'' were issued with a speech by Lord James with
instructions to check against delivery. We will not tire you with the details
but the assembled journalists were surprised to read in the news release: ``We
will be engaging many more groups and individuals in carrying forward the
strategy. An important part of that process has been publication of the booklet
and leaflet which you will have found on your seats. These are Reducing
Business Crime (hold up booklet) and Reducing Crime in Your Business (hold up
leaflet).''
Lord James, being a member of the Faculty of Advocates, is fully trained in
following a brief. He managed nae bother to hold aloft both booklet and leaflet
as instructed by his Scottish Office minders.
Trial and error
READERS with extraordinarily long memories may recall a story we had about
Donald MacPherson, a cattle breeder of Appin, Argyll, who named one of his
prize beasts after Mark Walters of Rangers. Like the player, it was black, a
rare specimen, and won many prizes.
The MacPhersons have now entered a beast in this week's big cattle show at
Smithfield with an equally intriguing name. The coo (steer, heifer, bullock, or
whatever) is called OJ Simpson and has been so called because the owners hoped
it would be as successful as the American accused when it comes to swaying
judges.
Alas, OJ lost out yesterday in the heavyweight steer competition to another
Scottish beast called No-Kan-Do from Carnoustie.
Still, on the steer name front, at the Perth Winter Fair, a steer had a very
successful kick through the show-ring bars at the spectators. Its name, we are
told, was Eric Cantona.
No thanks
DEPT of We Think We Know What They Mean: A publication called Strathclyde
Insider has a recipe for marzipan delight. (Very Christmassy, dare we say it?)
It includes the instructions: ``Lift balls with cocktail stick and dip bottom
into white chocolate.'' Perhaps, we'll stick with the stilton.
q.In the same vein, we hear of instructions left for the cook at an outdoor
centre on the island of Arran: ``The vegetarian family won't eat fish or
anything that was alive except for the little girl.''
Paws for thought
IN the pets for sale column of the Dunfermline Press we find: ``Persian
Sealpoint, three years old, neutered Tom cat, with accessories......'' Surely a
contradiction in terms, here.
Survival course
A TALE of how tough it is these days for your average student to survive on the
meagre grants doled out by this Government. A young lad at Robert Gordon
University in Aberdeen managed to blow his grant within the first few weeks of
term. Recalling the traditional story of the Scots lad o' pairts who survived
at university on a sack of oatmeal from home, the student duly invested in a
large quantity of same.
Following the recipe, he made a large batch of porridge and left it to set in a
greaseproofed chest of drawers. He duly ate his way through this simple but
honest fare. We would like to tell you that this has a happy ending but the
word is that the lad now has scurvy.

<HEADLINE>Murdered Libyan knew of warning</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>
<PAGE>11</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975159395</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A POLITICAL dissident from Libya found murdered in his shop in London had been
warned of a plot to kill him weeks before his death.
Police said Ali Mehmed Abuzeid, 54, suffered a number of stab wounds to the
upper body in his grocer's shop at the weekend.
Mr Abuzeid was a co-founder of the National Front for the Salvation of Libya,
one of the most influential groups opposed to Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.
In 1984, he helped launch a failed attack on Gaddafi's headquarters in Tripoli,
for which it is believed he was sentenced to death. He was imprisoned for 20
months in the 1970s.
The policeman leading the murder hunt, Detective Superintendent Dick Bell,
played down speculation about a Libyan hit squad. He said: ``I think it is
unlikely that a Libyan agent carried this out, although I cannot rule out a
political connection at this stage.
``I am aware from neighbours that Mr Abuzeid had gone to them saying he had
been threatened but exactly who by and what for I don't know.''
He said police were aware of Mr Abuzeid's connections with the Libyan
opposition but were keeping an open mind about the motive.
Mr Bell said a knife had been found but it had not yet been confirmed as the
murder weapon. It might simply be from the shop.
A shopowner two doors from Mr Abuzeid in Westbourne Grove, west London, said:
``Somebody had advised him to be careful and look out because someone was going
to kill him. He was confused.
``It was a friendly call, not a threat, but the caller did not say who he was.
He said: `I am doing you a favour because someone is coming to kill you'.''
Shopkeepers agreed Mr Abuzeid was a genial and hard-working family man and they
believed he had retired from active political life.
However, Mohammed Fayez Jibril, spokesman for the NFSL, said: ``There is
nothing that makes us doubt it is a political assassination. Gaddafi has a long
history of political assassinations. We are sure it is Gaddafi.''

Too soon after being over the moon, age can make footballers parrot-sick at the
prospect of no prospects. Ian Black meets a man with a mission to change that,
and a message for beginners......
TONY HIGGINS is a man with a mission. He is the secretary of the Scottish
Professional Footballers Association, and he has his mind set on training and
education. He says: ``People tend to forget that for every Tommy Burns or Paul
Sturrock, there are a hundred guys, a hundred ex-footballers, who are
struggling to find work, either inside or outside the game. Obviously I
wouldn't like to name names, but I know a lot of guys who have more or less
given up struggling.''
Tony, now 41, played full-time for 12 years and then went part-time to finish
his education, taking a diploma in Youth and Community Studies at Jordanhill.
He is unusual for a professional footballer in that he has Highers and had
considered several universities before choosing to try his luck as a player.
His mission, in his words, is ``to get players to start thinking as early as
possible about alternative careers. When you're 20 you don't think about being
35. You just think about being a player, but as players get older, into their
thirties, then they start to panic, trying to find a career or something in
life that will give them the status they had as a footballer.''
Changes within the game in the last two or three years have meant that many
clubs, even former full-time clubs in the First Division, are now offering
part-time contracts. This means having to think about a career even earlier,
because part-time money is anything from #20 up to a maximum of #100 per week
which, as Tony says, ``doesn't offer you a financial base on which to lead a
normal life''.
Six years ago Tony presented a paper to the Football League and the SFA and,
based on this, he set up the SFPA Educational Trust, which is funded by the
SFA, the Football League, and the Football Trust. The three of these contribute
a yearly sum which totals ``over five figures'', says Tony with some pride. It
is a pride edged with caution, however......
The income of the Football Trust has dropped, thanks to the National Lottery,
and his plans to appoint an Education Officer have had to be shelved -
temporarily, he hopes - as an agreement in principle has already been reached
with the various authorities.
He says: ``The game needs an education department but in the meantime it will
be necessary to have someone to go round to clubs talking to the players and
offering advice to them on a variety of subjects. I believe the ethos of
educating players as much as possible has to be established.''
He might have a bit of bother with the clubs, many of which still appear to
labour under the delusion that Scotland is still bursting at the seams with
raw, under-educated and exploitable talent slavering to play for pennies and
then be consigned to the graveyard of hopes that is being an ex-footballer with
no other skills. There are not many ex-footballers who can become professional
ex-footballers like George Best, and even fewer who go on to become managers,
though one of the liaisons that Tony has set up is with the HNC in Management
Studies at Caledonian University. Pat Bonner of Celtic and Fraser Wishart of
Hearts have already passed this course, so you can look out for them as
successful future managers, though not necessarily in football.
There are around 1000 professional players in Scotland and already over 100 of
them have availed themselves of the services of the Educational Trust.
Awareness is growing and the net of relationships and contacts that has been
set up is widening:  it currently includes courses in accountancy, chiropody
and languages, to name but a few.
The trust pays all fees for players under 21, and for older players they pay
two-thirds, Tony's argument being that if you've put some of your own money
into it then you're likely to appreciate it more and try harder.
Someone who spent 18 years of his life as a professional footballer is Roddy
Georgeson, now 47 and a senior development executive with Scottish Enterprise.
He has spent all his (outside football) working life involved in some branch of
training or other, starting with the DoE, then the Training Agency until the
merger with the SDA. He says: ``Never, not once, when I was playing did I
receive a single word of advice or caution about the future.
``Mind you, if I had, I probably wouldn't have listened. But it is important.''
Roddy also points out the importance of club involvement and the different
degrees of caring, even in clubs of the same city. ``When I went to Dundee
after my first two seasons at Port Vale I was 19. I was what you might call a
free spirit. There we were, four guys in a flat, no supervision, nothing. At
Dundee United, though, the guys were in a club hostel, encouraged to get into
other things.
``In those days, round about '68, there weren't even any tactics. You just
turned up on the day and checked if your name was on the team-sheet. The
manager would say, `This is an important one. Go out there and play your own
game', and that was it.''
Terry Christie, recently triumphant with Stenhousemuir, is the only manager he
ever worked with who taught him tactics. ``I now know where to stand at corners
and free kicks, thanks to Terry,'' laughs Roddy.
Roddy had four O-Levels when he left school but now has a diploma in Management
Studies. He was wiser than most in that he got a job at 21 and switched to
part-time football - though jobs were easier to find in 1970.
Tony has had discussions with Minister for Sport Iain Sproat regarding the
melding of sport and education - something not much practised in Scotland
though the subjects are regarded as indivisible in countries like Germany and
Sweden.
His latest initiative is a sort of Compleat Footballer, now compulsory for all
players under 21. It won't be the last.

AT the same time as one of football's most popular characters, Morton manager
Allan McGraw, has become the second team leader to be taken ill in the dug-out
this season, following Paul Sturrock's collapse earlier in the year, a new
study has discovered that players themselves suffer from relatively little
stress.
Perhaps that demonstrates that psychologists Dr Howard Khan, and Sarah Hurry of
Herriot Watt University, chose the wrong subjects for their survey, if they
were attempting to unearth some of the causes of sporting strain.
It seems from their findings, which were based on questions put to 512 players
in the premier and first divisions, that the modern Scottish footballer does
not get too uptight about anything.
There are minor pressures to get a good result, to please the fans, and to
avoid a ``bad press,'' but, in general, the lads appear to be a pretty
laid-back bunch.
This does not quite tie in with the characters who are literally sick with
nerves before matches, who stick by ludicrous superstitions before they tackle
any game, and who are so hyped up, they commit uncharacteristic assaults on
opponents before they settle down.
Nevertheless, the exceptions maybe prove the rule, and it hardly comes as a
surprise that in a team game, the pressures on individuals to succeed for their
own sake are not quite as ferocious as they are in sports where the players are
completely self dependent.
Golfers and tennis players survive entirely by their own efforts, which may
explain why it is becoming the custom to carry around a sports psychologist in
the kit-bag on both circuits.
There is another reason why the stresses and strains of modern football, or
rugby for that matter, may be not as demanding as, say, the golf tour.
Footballers and rugby men get the chance, once the game begins, to use real
physical exercise to release any pent-up emotions, unlike the golfer whose
tensions increase as the tournament progresses at a sedate pace.
It may also be why there is a contrast between footballers and managers in the
stress league.
Jock Stein died in Cardiff as Scottish fans and players were celebrating an
important international victory and, while there will be more detailed medical
language to explain his passing, we all are aware that he died because of
excessive demands.
At management level in professional football, the pressures are perhaps the
most immense and unfair in any walk of life. Few comparisons can be made with a
job which, by dint of its competitive nature, cannot be done perfectly by
anyone.
No team wins everything all the time and, therefore, every manager fails at
some time or another. The trick is not being sacked when your turn comes along.
This is the kind of pressure which becomes outrageous unless the manager is
blessed with financial security, a ridiculous ego, and a resilience that Arthur
Scargill would admire.
It does not apply only to those involved at the highest level. The two men who
have caused alarm throughout the game this season, Sturrock and McGraw, are
dealing in the first division where it is claimed there is not quite as much
strain, a claim that clearly does not bear examination.
Psychologically, many players' biggest worry would be how to spell it. Those
who worry and fret rarely reach the highest standard simply because their egos
are not armour plated and immune to self doubt.
Even those individuals, however, become different personalities if they go on
to management where they have to depend entirely on the talents of others.
Management, as it were, is a different ball game. Not one to envy, either.

Tomorrow Judge Stephen Tumim visits Scotland. James Freeman considers his views
on penal reform
IN TERMS of the prisons debate in England there have been two ages - before
Judge Stephen Tumim and after him. Few ordinary folk outside politics or the
justice system south of the Border knew much about the state of their jails,
the odd riot apart, prior to Judge Tumim becoming chief inspector of prisons
and fewer gave a damn. That changed when the white-haired Crown Court Judge,
little known outside the rather elitist world of contemporary art in London,
entered the fray.
Quickly identified by the     serious media as a gift, he      embarked on an
eight-year career as a thorn in the side of a Government whose view of
imprisonment is clearly determined by one criterion and one alone - the
desperate need to be re-elected.
At least there is now a debate; people are better informed and Michael Howard
has not walked away from the Derek Lewis sacking unharmed. Healthy scepticism
over the party conference promises on imprisonment by the Tories is everywhere
evident, on both sides of the       Border.
It could be argued that the learning curve for the Scottish public has not been
so steep, the benefit of a smaller society with a healthy indigenous press
which still pays attention to social policy. Judge Tumim will, however, bring
his message north tomorrow when he address the Howard League in Edinburgh, and
the message is deceptively simple.
Prisons, he believes, have only one purpose which is to reduce the crime rate.
The way to achieve that aim is through education.
``I think it is necessary to think again about the whole purpose of prisons,''
he says, ``what prisons are for, who goes there and how you achieve the
objective of reducing the crime rate. Most of the people we send to prisons are
not dangerous. They are mainly young men who suffer two defects - lack of
education and lack of a proper family background. Their crimes are connected
with drink, drugs and motor cars and this is true in England and Scotland and
all round the world.''
Drink plays just as important a role in this universal truth as drugs although
drugs grab the headlines, Judge Tumim says. He steps back from a dogfight with
Michael Howard over how change in these young men is to be achieved but one can
readily observe what makes the Government so uncomfortable with this analysis.
Meaningful education programmes in prisons are difficult to achieve, the
unstated text runs, and do not interest headline writers. The reverse is
probably true, that the tabloids are more likely to scream about soft options
and - as anyone connected with the Scottish prisons experience since the return
of Michael Forsyth knows - the tabloids are a major preoccupation.
There is no choice but to tackle the difficulties, Judge Tumim declares,
starting from the day they enter prison with the three Rs followed by what he
calls moral education, teaching the young prisoners the difference between
right and wrong. They must be taught self-control as well as simple social
skills such as hygiene, budgeting, the problems they create for victims, and
they must learn to work.
The establishment or re-establishment of family links is also vitally important
if young prisoners are not to reoffend, he says, but work breeds self-respect.
Judge Tumim arrives in Scotland at a point when prison industries are under
review so his experience, particularly of one German model, is highly relevant.
While in Bavaria he saw at first hand the idea of a real industrial plant
relocated inside a prison with prisoners learning the industrial process,
earning full wages, paying tax and national insurance and keeping their
families free of state support.
``Of course there would be an outcry here about why should we be helping
prisoners when the law abiding are out of work but there is no good reason why
it should not happen. You get back to the fundamental purpose of reducing the
crime rate and that is what prisons are about,'' he declares. He has raised the
matter in past reports, he remarks drily, and while everyone was very much in
favour no-one has done anything with the idea.
A firm believer in the three-legged school of penal thought - a balance inside
prisons between security, care and order, and justice - Judge Tumim is clearly
unhappy about the present concentration on security at the expense of the other
vital factors.
His fears were confirmed when he recently discovered that one major London jail
had reduced its education programmes by 50% to pay for increased security.
At the same time he will not attack the Government's proposed Supermax prisons,
the vastly-expensive American idea for ensuring that the tiny - 2% or 3% -
proportion of truly dangerous prisoners is kept totally secure.
``Is there not a real threat, however, that in the TV and tabloid age these
will be turned into Devil's Island? It could get all too emotional, out of
proportion. And if you should lose control you lose control of all your most
dangerous prisoners at once,'' he says. He favours keeping the dispersal
prisons in better shape.
What do the prisons do well?
Judge Tumim states: ``What I call the resettlement prisons, where men who have
served very long sentences are resocialised by being given responsibility such
as their own keys and jobs outside, I think are the best thing in the
English prison system. They give men a sense of self worth. This is an
enormously important aspect, possibly the most important if you accept the
definition that prisons are about cutting the crime rate.''
In his eight years as chief inspector he has worked with five Home Secretaries,
constant change which has not helped progress. He believes the debate has taken
a sour turn, particularly over such matters as accountability for policy on the
one hand and operational issues on the other, and that what is really needed is
a lengthy period of stability to let the policy pendulum swing back in the
right direction.
He will find few tomorrow in Scotland who disagree with that.

<HEADLINE>Up to 1900 on child protection registers</HEADLINE>

ALMOST 1900 youngsters were placed on child protection registers in Scotland
during the first year of a system of collating information.
Scotland's social work departments were asked to investigate around 7500
possible cases of children requiring care and protection during the 12 months
up to March last year, according to the first statistical bulletin on child
protection management information, published yesterday.
The bulletin shows that nearly 3000 referrals went to case conference stage to
decide on the need for action against unacceptable levels of risk. A total of
1880 children were placed on the protection registers.
Scottish Home Affairs Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton described the
publication as a valuable feature for the effective protection of children.
``I hope that local authorities will use the output of this system in their
management of child-protection services. It should improve management and
thereby improve services,'' he said.
Of the 1880 child protection orders, 45% covered children at risk of physical
injury, 25% were to prevent sexual abuse, 19% for physical neglect, 9% for
emotional abuse, and 2% for ``failure to thrive''.
Forty-one percent of the children lived with their natural parents, 24% with
only the mother, 11% with the mother and partner, and 6% with mother and
stepfather.
Parents were the suspected main perpetrator in 70% of cases, with the father
the suspect in 40% and the mother in 30% of cases.
According to the statistics, 97% of sexual abuse cases involved a man. In 41%
of cases, he was the natural father, in 23% another relative, and in 18% the
mother's partner.
At the end of March 1994, the total number of children registered for
protection stood at 2666, an average of 2.3 per 1000 of youngsters under 18,
which was unchanged from the previous year.
The numbers of children on regional registers ranged from 55, or less than one
per 1000, in Fife, to 744, almost five per 1000, in Lothian. In Strathclyde,
the number was 785 - 1.5 per 1000.
The bulletin shows that referral rates during the year varied from region to
region above and below a national average of 6.7 per 1000 children. The Western
Isles had the lowest rate, at 1.7. Central had the highest referral rate - 14.4.

<HEADLINE>Labour warns of investment risk. Railtrack  in line for bargain sell off</HEADLINE>

THE rail industry fears the Government is so keen to press on with
privatisation before the next General Election that Railtrack will be sold at a
``give away'' price.
Senior Railtrack executives are to visit Scotland next week to try to interest
financial institutions in the investment opportunities offered by the
privatisation due next spring.
However, Labour's front-bench transport spokesman, Mr Brian Wilson, sounded a
note of caution. ``Nobody is going to make a fast buck out of Railtrack,'' he
warned would-be speculators.
``I am giving the clearest possible notice that this would be an extremely high
risk investment given the fact that Railtrack's revenue is over- whelmingly
dependent on political decisions on subsidy. Responsible investors should wait
for the partnership opportunities in expanding the railways which Labour is
very keen on.''
There is also a warning light from the newly privatised rolling stock leasing
companies (Roscos). British Rail management, in the main, believes the rolling
stock was handed over at such advantageous terms that the Roscos could expect
to face similar ``windfall tax'' levies from a Labour Government to those
already faced by the privatised utility companies.
It is argued that if Railtrack were floated on the Stock Exchange in such a way
as to attract handsome profits, those investors could also face a windfall tax
levy.
BR chiefs, who value the industry's infrastructure assets at some #6000m,
believe the Government is prepared to let them go at below #2000m, possibly
below #1500m, just to keep privatisation on course and make it difficult if not
impossible for an incoming Labour Government to reverse the process.
They are also deeply critical of the terms at which the three Roscos were sold
off earlier this month for almost #1800m. They are also unhappy the Roscos have
been guaranteed about #500,000 a year of taxpayers' money, yet they will be
under no obligation to invest it in new rolling stock.
``They could even bid for rail franchises or invest in the National Lottery
such is the total lack of deregulation,'' said one disgruntled BR board member
yesterday.
Labour clearly believes there is a possibility of halting the latest sale but
are clearly concerned about a cut-price deal.
Mr Wilson said: ``I have all along been concerned that a scorched earth policy
would be pursued as a General Election came closer and every effort is being
made to head it off.
``We are already committed to bringing the rolling stock companies under the
regulator so as to force investment and limit profits. The terms of a Railtrack
sell off, which we firmly believe can be prevented, would obviously affect the
potential cost of bringing it back.''
The Government is expected to achieve its declared aim of seeing 51% of
passenger services in the private sector, although perhaps not until April 1997
rather than the original target date of April 1996.
An incoming Labour Government would then be left with the worst of all possible
worlds, with half the industry in private hands. It would then have to decide
whether it should seek to bring the bulk of the industry back into the public
sector, for instance through the renationalisation of all or a majority of
Railtrack, or opt instead for public control of the industry by way of tighter
regulation.

<HEADLINE>Engineer rejects 100p-a-share bid before having its own offer turned down by McAlpine. Amec rebuffs Kvaerner move</HEADLINE>

IN one of the few hostile Norwegian moves against British interests since the
Vikings, Kvaerner has made its all-cash 100p-a-share bid for the Amec
engineering and construction group.
The offer was rejected late in the afternoon by Amec chairman Sir Alan Cockshaw
who was in Japan over the weekend to drum up new business.
But soon after the Kvaerner move, Amec found itself slighted by Alfred McAlpine
to whom it had made a friendly overture on Thursday which it followed up on
Friday with an unsolicited bid of two new Amec shares for each McAlpine.
McAlpine's board unanimously turned down the offer, chief executive Oliver
Whitehead saying it was not really of interest to the construction firm.
He added there had been protracted discussions last year but a merger approach
could not be made to work because of the large number of Preference shares with
a convertible price of 410p overhanging the Amec financial structure.
Kvaerner president and chief executive Erik Tonseth said there were important
industrial synergies between it and Amec, with Amec having a higher value for
it than it had on its own.
He added in an aside that when Kvaerner had bought the Govan shipyard on the
Clyde in 1988 people had thought it slightly mad.
Govan was now making small profits and, although it had not achieved the
profitability seen elsewhere in the group, it was doing ``marvellously''
compared with all other European shipbuilders.
He was visibly annoyed by the Amec approach to McAlpine. That had valued each
share at 138p, at the time equivalent to an Amec share price of 69p, compared
with the 100p Kvaerner had paid in the Thursday dawn raid mounted by SBC
Warburg.
That netted 10% as he had wanted and raised the total Kvaerner stake to 12%. It
was increased last night to 14%.
On Thursday he had had a friendly meeting with Sir Alan and, basically, they
had the same views except that Amec wanted to remain an independent company.
He said he was surprised that, as the second largest shareholder, he had not
been told it was about to make its McAlpine bid.
The attraction for him is that both companies supply the oil and gas sectors
but in different parts of the North Sea, separated by a line where there should
be a single market.
Amec is more concentrated on executing turnkey projects and would benefit from
the Kvaerner balance sheet which, with just over #700m of shareholder funds, is
more than 10 times greater than that of Amec.
Kvaerner employs about 23,000 people compared with Amec's 20,000, but Mr
Tonseth would not be drawn on the scale of rationalisation other than to say
the housebuilding activities would be sold.
Having a UK base would bring the benefits of Britain's international links and
political clout which Norway lacks in these markets, particularly Asia.
The offer is final and will not be increased unless there is a counter-bid. It
closes on December 18.The general sentiment is that Amec will find it difficult
to resist given its dull record in recent years.
An offer for the 172 million Preference shares will be made later this week as
the Budget could include stock market implications for interest rates.

PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela is to be the new patron of the Scottish Refugee
Council.
He will be welcomed at a reception in Edinburgh on Thursday.
The refugee council was set up in 1985 to support refugees arriving in Scotland
and the reception will mark its 10th anniversary.
Canon Kenyon Wright, the present patron, said yesterday that, for 10 years, the
refugee council had been a living witness of all that was best in the character
of Scotland - care for the victim, openness to the poor or powerless, and
readiness to learn from others who were different.
``Nelson Mandela's magnificent gesture in accepting the invitation is, I am
sure, both a tribute to the Scottish Refugee Council itself and a recognition
of the leading role Scotland played in the fight against apartheid and racism.''
Canon Wright said that, in a society increasingly divided and closing its doors
on compassion, the refugee council's work would be even more important in the
next 10 years.
Councillor Keith Geddes, Lothian Regional Council's leader of administration,
said he was keen that the new Edinburgh City Council should continue to support
the Refugee Council.

<TEXT>
NIALL Lothian, president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland
(ICAS), last night emphasised the need for an independent regulator to oversee
ICAS and the UK's other accountancy bodies, writes IAN McCONNELL.
Professor Lothian believes the profession, which has until now regulated
itself, must be answerable to a truly independent body if public confidence is
to be ensured.
He said: ``I think that informed political commentators and informed pockets of
the media are rightly sceptical about whether or not we can be legislator,
judge and jury in our own court.
``It is in addressing that issue, against the background of corporate collapses
in the past decade, that we are really driven to examining our own procedures.''
The initial view of an ICAS working party, which has not yet been finalised, is
that all regulatory activities should be put beyond the perimeter fence of the
profession. Regulatory activities encompass auditing standards, monitoring, and
discipline.
A less radical change is proposed by the English and Welsh institute's working
party, which believes regulatory activities should remain within the
profession's domain. It believes an external body should be formed to comment
publicly on the efficacy of these activities.
Professor Lothian envisages an independent regulatory body appointed by the
profession and users of the audit product such as the Bank of England, the
Stock Exchange, and the Confederation of British Industry. This could report to
Parliament.
Referring to the current self-regulatory regime, Professor Lothian said: ``The
public interest must be protected. It is just a touch too easy what is going on
just now.''
Professor Lothian's comments came in response to those made in Edinburgh by
Stuart Bell, Labour's spokesman on trade and corporate affairs.
Mr Bell said: ``Three years ago we pointed out that the accountancy profession
would have to put its own house in order, otherwise a Labour government would
have to do it for them.
``Since that time, however, we have been satisfied with the way the proposals
on regulation of the profession have developed.''

<HEADLINE>Salvesen enjoys a bright day as profit and shares jump</HEADLINE>

ONE of the brightest days for a considerable time for Christian Salvesen saw
its share price jump 14p to 254p after better-than-expected half-time results
and evidence that its long-term strategy is already beginning to pay off.
The best guide to performance is operating profit which showed an improvement
of 5.1% to #45.4m from the continuing activities and will benefit from more
than #100m of investment this year. These exclude the Salvesen brick and Vicoma
oil spill clearance activities which have been sold off and which brought in
#2.9m in the preceding year.
The actual pre-tax total showed an 8.7% improvement to #46.1m but that was
boosted by a #2.1m gain from the sale of currency swaps.
Distribution had a relatively mundane experience as measured by the headline 3%
rise in its contribution to #22.3m. But that conceals deep eddies.
The UK food activities were affected by a shortfall in the availability of
fresh produce thanks to the drought.
That actually hit the separate food services division harder. There profits
tumbled #1.6m to #4.9m as a result of reduced availability of fresh vegetables
and fruit. However, that should be partially recovered in the current half with
the Tendafrost frozen foods subsidiary benefiting from higher frozen pea prices.
Chief executive Dr Chris Masters said yesterday that margins in UK food retail
distribution will remain under pressure as the supermarkets continue to press
to take costs out of their business.
One major example is the seven-year contract with Tesco to create nine
recycling centres which will wash more than 200 million plastic trays a year
and reclaim 160,000 tonnes of packaging - the saving to Tesco will amount to
#12m annually.
In Germany there was a slight loss in retail distribution but elsewhere the
overall picture was much more encouraging. Salvesen has been able to pick up
substantial new contracts in Italy and Holland helped by its information
technology skills which are now available throughout western Europe and,
therefore, are a major selling point when dealing with food manufacturers with
international business. It is one of very few in that position.
To this end and to strengthen its underlying management in Europe, it is
pulling back 16 people from South Africa as it reckons there are more immediate
and better opportunities nearer home.
Industrial customers such as car manufacturers are increasing their load
requirements on Salvesen and that is generally better margin business than food.
Encouragingly, out-sourcing of logistics is rising by 18% annually in the EU
and consumer non-foods - Salvesen's biggest contract here is with Marks &amp;
Spencer - is increasing by 12%, while food distribution is up by only 4% in
Europe implying that it is flat in the more mature British market.
Thanks to a large measure the US, the Aggreko electricity, temperature control
and plant hire operations have resumed growth with profits up 21% to #18.2m.
There the introduction of oil-free compressed air is finding ready buyers in
the chemical sector, where monitoring equipment can be affected by the
traditional compressed air absorbing oil droplets which have then to be
filtered out.
Full-year profits, shorn of the disposals and with the second half being
traditionally the lighter, seem set to increase about #3m to #78m. That points
to the shares being traded at 13 times likely earnings.
The interim dividend has been raised marginally to 3.5p with an 8.8p total
probable for a 4.3% yield.

q FRENCH Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said in Barcelona tonight the peace
deal initialled in Dayton, Ohio, last week between Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia
would probably be signed in Paris in the second week of December.
De Charette said he had discussed the timing in a telephone call with US
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and expected they would agree to set a
final date tomorrow.
The Muslim-led Bosnian government, and international negotiators who helped
broker the deal, have made it clear US participation in the peace force is
crucial to the success of the whole package.
The Serbs are incensed that Sarajevo suburbs they hold will revert to the
control of the new Muslim-Croat federation under the terms of the accord, and
have threatened carnage.
United Nations officials in the capital said Serbs were ``very, very nervous''
about the changes, and warned of a possible mass exodus from the
districts.-Reuter.

GORDON Sherry, who at a dinner this evening at the Glasgow Golf Club will be
presented with his award as winner of the 1995 J&amp;B Scottish order of merit, is
just beginning to get his breath back at the end of a particularly busy and
eventful last full season as an amateur. He can now take stock of it - and also
look ahead.
In that latter vision Sherry will in January travel to Arizona for three or
four weeks of practice in the sunshine at Desert Mountain, the course near
Phoenix which is one of several developed by the American, Lyle Anderson, among
whose other interests is the Loch Lomond club, of which Sherry is an honorary
life member.
Then in March, in his build-up for the US Masters, Sherry will first practise
at Valderrama, in southern Spain, a course similar in character to Augusta
National, and then have a week in Georgia in advance of the first of the
season's four major championships. After he has competed in that Sherry will
turn professional.
``I've had a great time as an amateur,'' Sherry says. ``I've played in Walker
Cup, Eisenhower Trophy and European championship sides and won the Amateur
Championship. There's little chance of repeating all these achievements and I
just feel the time has come to move on to other things.''
A spring-time declaration of intent does, however, mean there must be something
of a lull in Sherry's career, since he will not be able to play the European
Tour school until next November. However, he hopes he will be able to keep his
game in trim by receiving sponsors' invitations to tournaments.
Since Sherry became only the third Scottish golfer in 50 attempts since the
Second World War to win Britain's foremost title, his victory in the Amateur
last June would occur to most observers to have been the highlight for him. But
Sherry, surprisingly perhaps, takes another view of the priorities.
``Winning at Hoylake was all I ever wanted to do as an individual this season,
particularly as I'd lost in the final last year at Nairn,'' Sherry reflects.
``That opened a lot of doors, such as gaining exemption into the Open
Championship and the Masters.
``But it meant everything to me first to make the Walker Cup team and then to
help Britain and Ireland to beat the United States at Royal Porthcawl,'' he
continues. ``It's more satisfying, I think, to be part of a team success.'' In
a game that is inevitably as self-absorbed as golf, that ranks as a rare
admission.
The other cause for satisfaction in a co-operative venture was the 100% record
Sherry achieved to make a huge contribution towards Scotland's victory in the
European team championship at Royal Antwerp - not least, presumably, because it
concluded with a healthy 6-1 defeat of the Auld Enemy, England, in the final.
Apart from the Walker Cup match the most memorable period extended over three
successive weeks last summer when, after the European victory, Sherry was equal
fourth among a high-class field in the Scottish Open at Carnoustie, (the
highest finish ever by an amateur in a European Tour event), and then made the
cut in the Open at St Andrews.
That extended an exhausting sequence of practice and competition, under the
pressures of the occasion and the scrutiny of both the public and the media,
led to Sherry's decision - controversial at the time and one he shared with
Stephen Gallacher - not to play in the Scottish Amateur championship at
Southerness. But Sherry maintains he did the right thing.
``I'd never won the Scottish,'' Sherry says ``but I felt I had to pull out in
the best interests of preparing for the Walker Cup match. I know I later played
in the Canadian Amateur (in which he reached the semi-final), but that was like
a holiday. There was less pressure and it was an ideal refresher.''
Rubbing shoulders with such luminaries of the game as Jack Nicklaus, Tom
Watson, and Greg Norman has taught Sherry, he himself believes, valuable
lessons on how to manage himself on and off the course.
The achievements he has had thus far suggest he has already successfully served
a considerable part of his apprenticeship.

A PASSENGER boat capsized and sank on the Ganges river in the Indian state of
Bihar today but there were conflicting reports on casualties.
Domestic news agencies reported that between 20 and 80 people were feared
drowned. But a police official in Monghyr district, where the vessel went down,
told Reuters by telephone there were no casualties.
``About 60 persons on board swam to safety. By the time the boat reached the
shore, there was a stampede to get off in a rush which caused the mishap. None
have met with a watery grave,'' police Deputy Inspector General Naseem Ahmed
said.
Ahmed said there were about 80 people on board. The police had thrown a huge
net into the river near Mallihar Ghat, where the boat sank, to fish out
survivors, he said.
The United News of India said at least 80 people were feared drowned and quoted
official sources as saying no bodies had yet been recovered. It gave no further
details.
The Press Trust of India (PTI) said at least 25 people were feared drowned when
an overloaded boat capsized in the Ganges in Bihar's Begusarai district today.
Begusarai is adjacent to Monghyr. It was not clear whether the two news
agencies were referring to the same boat.
PTI said the boat, which was built to carry 40 people, was carrying over twice
the number.
The news agency quoted police officials as saying two bodies had been recovered
so far.
q.A rickety boat crowded with Haitians headed to the United States capsized,
and authorities said 47 people may have drowned, independent Radio Metropole
said today.
Local authorities in the northwestern town of Port-de-Paix have already
recovered seven bodies, the report said.
The report said the incident occurred over the weekend. Immigration officials
say Port-de-Paix has served as a popular point of departure in recent months
for clandestine boat trips to the United States.
On Friday, the US Coast Guard intercepted 516 Haitians who departed
Port-de-Paix in a freighter.-Reuter.

FOUR key players who are due to start their suspensions this weekend will still
be able to play on Saturday as a consequence of the trend of playing live TV
matches on Sunday.
Each of the quartet, Celtic's John Hughes and Peter Grant, Rangers' Paul
Gascoigne, and Hibernian's Michael O'Neill, suffered the final card which took
them over the punishment threshold in the derby games a week last Sunday.
Apart from O'Neill's immediate one-game ban for being sent off, the suspensions
which were then imposed do not begin until a fortnight after the offence, which
means all of them are free to play this Saturday.
In Celtic's case, that may not be considered a big advantage, as Grant and
Hughes, who will each miss three games, will be available for the home match
with Kilmarnock.
But on the down side is the fact that they now miss the hazardous journey to
Kirkcaldy to face Raith Rovers on Boxing Day. Before that, the two Parkhead men
will sit out the game against Hibs at Easter Road, and the home meeting with
Falkirk. The delayed ban might be seen as a bonus by Hibs. O'Neill will be
absent for three matches after being free to play in what looks a tough contest
against Motherwell at Fir Park, but he will then be out for the games against
Celtic and Raith Rovers at home before his last enforced day off, against
Partick Thistle at Firhill.
In Rangers' case, the delay will mean that their fans will get the chance to
see if the brilliance of Gascoigne in Edinburgh last week can be repeated in
the capital when they take on Hearts at Tynecastle. Given the choice, it seems
likely that the manager would have preferred to have the Englishman for that
task, rather than the one game he will now miss - the home match with Partick
Thistle on December 9.
Thistle fans might object to that line of thinking, of course, and they might
be even cheekier if their manager, Murdo MacLeod, seals the transfer of Mark
McNally from Celtic this week. The #60,000 deal looks certain to be completed
when the Parkhead defender returns from a visit down south later in the week.
If that happens, then MacLeod would free Steve Welsh to make his move to
Lincoln City, who have been patiently waiting for Thistle to fill the position
before getting their man, also for #60,000.
MacLeod is keen to see McNally in his team. ``The lad has played at the top
level with Celtic after having come through the ranks at Parkhead. He is the
kind we could build the team around, and if we do settle his transfer, it would
give everybody at the club a lift. A new face always does that and especially
one from a big club.''
MacLeod intends to give reserve keeper Mark Cairns his chance, now that Nicky
Walker will be out with a broken jaw for a couple of months. ``The lad is the
reserve keeper, and he deserves his chance,'' said the manager. ``After all, he
is 26, and if he is not good enough now, he never will be.''
Meanwhile Walker, who has been outstanding all season, is determined the injury
will not deflect him from reaching the European Championship finals next
season. ``I'm quite fortunate. In most cases like mine, it takes three months
before you can play agan, but because of my position, the specialist reckons I
should be able to come back after about eight weeks, as long as I'm careful.
``The injury isn't too bad. There's just a constant ache. I can still talk,
even if I can't eat much. Hopefully, I will be back in good time to stake a
claim for a Scotland place at the Euro finals. That would be a great experience.
``There is not an international until March, so that could work in my favour. I
know that they are trying to increase the size of the finals' squads to 22, and
that should secure a place for a third goalkeeper.
``Obviously, Jim Leighton and Andy Goram will be going if they are fit, and I
reckon there are three or four keepers who will fancy their chances of grabbing
the other place. I just want to get back and turn in performances that will
keep me in Craig Brown's thoughts.''-

Alienation is society's biggest concern, argues Steve Bruce
LYNNE Brown, a political activist from South Africa's ANC, believes that Scots
are ``disillusioned with the conventional political process'' and feel
powerless to do anything much about it. She may well be right, but to get some
perspective we need to divide her estimation of the scale of the problem by
half. That is to compensate for the fact professional politicians have an
unhealthy appetite for politics.
Scaled down to the expectations of sensible people, how bad is our
disillusionment? We still vote in healthy numbers for General (if not local)
elections and most of us do that despite having seen our votes at the last four
elections count for nothing. And not all apathy results from unhappiness. Many
Scottish schools are unable to find enough parent representatives to form
school boards because those parents are satisfied with their schools.
However, if Lynne Brown has been talking to those community activists who toil
in our ``sink'' housing schemes, like Aisyphus bravely, endlessly and
fruitlessly rolling the boulder up the hill, it is easy to see why she is
struck by tales of fatalism. There is a large disenfranchised ``lumpen
proletariat'' out there. It cut itself off from the political process to avoid
the poll tax. It is further alienated by the requirement to seek the middle
ground which our first past-the-post electoral structure imposes.
Even if the unemployed all voted, our major parties would direct their appeal
elsewhere.
Should we be concerned? Should we see parallels with Weimar Germany, a mass
ready for recruitment to fascism? There may be some potential for that. Like
blood in the faeces, traces of racist violence might indicate a deeper cancer
but the sad fact is that really desperate hopeless circumstances breed not
revolution but self-destruction.
We must also be careful about seeing as a frighteningly new problem something
which has always been with us. The feudal peasant was hardly an active citizen.
But we do need to recognise a real and worrisome change: the decline in
voluntary associations.
More important than electoral politics for a healthy society are the ties that
bind people in cross-cutting networks, each based around a specific interest:
churches, professional groups, organised leisure activities, educational
groups, social clubs, co-operatives, housing associations, tenants groups,
trades unions, charity groups, and therapeutic communities. Because people
belonged in two or three groups, their overlapping interests bound them
together, neutralised potential for conflict, and made them feel as if they had
a shared stake in their world.
Large holes have been torn in that mesh. Families are less stable and less
extensive, church-going has declined, workers education sounds pass, and
trade unionism is barely a force; we are no longer as connected. The average
employed worker is three times better off than his or her 1945 counter-part but
the large firm has given way to the small, the full-time, long-term job to the
part-time, short-term. The fortunate are better off but physically isolated.
The unfortunate are huddled but hopeless.
As Labour politicians are coming to appreciate, we cannot blame this all on
Thatcher's radical individualism. The welfare state, by promising to provide
for us, undermined traditions of self-help. Increasing freedom has meant
ever-greater cultural diversity and that is probably irreversible, as is the
decline in the faith that made churches such important voluntary institutions.
Globalisation of the world economy has removed from all governments many levers
for economic engineering.
It is sorely tempting to follow Herod into the washroom but there is an
alternative. We can recognise the disappearance of political power upwards to
trans-national entities such as the European Union must be balanced by the
devolution of power downwards to regions and localities.
The lumpen proleteriat will always be with us, as will be its most
self-destructive habits but, and this brings us back to Lynne Brown, we can try
to win some of those people back to civil society by creating genuinely
devolved structures and educating people to operate within them.
That will mean nothing unless we can also create economic opportunities that
return security to the well-off and return hope to the badly-off that they can
some day join the fortunate.
In the end, civil society depends on social security; not the euphemism for
state handouts, but the economic security which allows people to think of a
future which is better than the present. Now how do we do that?

TWO of Scotland's leading banks have told the Government that they are not
interested in helping to run the student loans system.
This rejection, plus that of other financial institutions, has raised doubts
about whether the Government will be able to implement a transfer of the loan
system to private finance, and could jeopardise legislation to enable this
currently going through Parliament.
A spokeswoman for the Bank of Scotland said it had been approached, but after
reviewing the draft tender document, had decided not to make a bid. At the
Royal Bank of Scotland, a spokes-man said that at the moment it was not
attracted to the scheme at all.
Building societies were also less than enthusiastic. An Alliance and Leicester
spokesman said ``certainly not'', and the Woolwich said it was not interested.
The Department for Education and Employment wants up to four financial
institutions to become involved in the system from the next financial year,
eventually to provide the majority of student loans.
The four would receive a subsidy for providing low-interest loans, but the
level of subsidy has not been disclosed. If interested, financial institutions
would have to say how much subsidy they would want, and those bidding the
smallest amount of subsidy would win the business.
The Government wishes to leave a margin of between 5% to 10% for bad debt, but
at present the amount expected never to be recovered is running at over 12%,
and is expected to grow.
Banks are also wary of the bad publicity they could attract by chasing students
for bad debt, and the knock-on effect on future business from former students.
It is believed that the education department hopes to pull in building
societies keen to use the loans scheme to develop their banking services -
despite failed attempts to diversify into other markets such as estate agency.

Cairo
FOUR central African leaders meet in Cairo today to try to halt the conflict
between Hutus and Tutsis that has devastated Rwanda and Burundi and left
neighbouring states facing a vast refugee crisis.
Former US president Jimmy Carter and his Atlanta-based centre for conflict
resolution will try to extract an agreement enabling more than three million
Rwandans to go home and paving the way for peaceful coexistence between the two
ethnic groups.
Up to one million Tutsis and Hutus massacred each other in the small central
African state of Rwanda last year and at least 100,000 people have been
slaughtered in two years in a similar conflict which continues in neighbouring
Burundi.
The bloodshed, which has origins dating back many centuries, has dragged in
Zaire, host to most of the refugees, and Uganda, the launching-pad for the
Tutsi-led rebellion which brought the present Rwandan government to power.
Tanzania, which has refugees from both Rwanda and Burundi, is sending to the
summit Abdulrahman Kinana, a special envoy from Tanzania's new president,
Benjamin Mkapa.
Former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere will help mediate between the
principal parties, along with Carter and Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South
Africa, the Carter Center said.
The level of violence has declined in the Rwanda-Burundi region since last year
but a big gap remains between Hutu leaders in exile and the government in
Kigali, which says it is doing its best to put the bloody past behind it.
In Burundi, the Tutsi-dominated army has stepped up its campaign against
suspected Hutu rebels, using an indiscriminate strategy which diplomats say is
likely to cripple peace prospects in the troubled country.
The weekend brought the exiled Hutus further cause for anxiety. Police in
Kenya, once a haven, arrested scores of Rwandans, possibly in connection with
the future trials.
On the summit agenda for urgent action stand two subsidiary problems - Zaire's
wish to repatriate the refugees from eastern Zaire as soon as possible and the
Rwandan government's reluctance to extend the mandate of UN forces on their
territory, widely seen as essential to security.--Reuter

THE forestry department of the chartered surveyor Bowlts, based in Pluscarden,
near Elgin in Moray, has planted its three-millionth native tree, at an estate
in Nairnshire.
The achievement is the culmination of almost five years work for a variety of
landowners in the Highlands and west Grampian areas who are keen to conserve
and enhance an essential part of Scotland's native woodland heritage.
The firm, whose forestry department has specialised in planting and
regeneration of native woodlands, reached the milestone while working at Lethen
Estate for Ewen Brodie.
Alastair Lumsden of Bowlts' forestry department said: ``New native pine
planting is generally carried out to help extend and link the fragments of the
existing mature native pinewood in an effort to restore the continuous
ecosystem that once covered Scotland.
``Many of our clients are particularly keen to help maintain and establish
pinewoods and become involved in the conservation of the native pinewood
resource.''

GORDON Gray, the professional at Dumfries and County for the past 23 years, is
the latest to discover that golfers can be born again in their fifties, having
just earned his card for the PGA European Seniors Tour.
The 51-year-old, who first took up the game at Bearsden along with brother
Martin, a Tartan Tour stalwart, has already competed in 11 seniors event over
the last season and a half, but is approaching 1996 with great vigour in the
knowledge that he will be able to play in up to 15 events, around half in
mainland Europe, without the uncertainties of pre-qualifying.
More golden moments are in prospect then, like the one this year in the Senior
British Open at Royal Portrush, where he found himself rubbing shoulders on the
practice range with Arnold Palmer and Gary Player. ``I could hardly believe I
was standing there with them. It was wonderful,'' he recalled.
Next season will be his first serious campaign for 25 years, since his largely
undistinguished two-year bid as a Bothwell Castle-based assistant on the
embryonic European Tour. He did have a top-100 ranking then, but he explained:
``There were many of us who tried, but we all came off the Tour and took club
jobs, because there was not enough money.''
Gray puts down much of his current rejuvenation to keeping himself in good
shape in the interim as a three times a week gymnasium regular, half an hour of
each session on running and bike work and the other half on weights, which he
plans to step up from light to heavy as a strengthening exercise.
Another factor has been his pleasure in watching the rise of Andrew Coltart. As
mentor to the youngest member of Scotland's first successful Dunhill Cup team
this year, it has obviously helped to give him acceptance as a coach, but it
goes beyond that.
Gray said: ``Andrew's success has been great for golf in the south of Scotland.
Undoubtedly, some of that has rubbed off on me, and now the south has a player
on both the regular and senior tours.''
Along with North Berwick's David Huish he will be one of only two home-based
Scottish regulars on the Seniors Tour next year, and one aspect of his game he
will be working on especially is his putting.
``In the tournaments I have played in so far I won around #8000. From tee to
green I could compete with most of the guys, but I didn't putt very well and
two months ago I switched to the broom-handle putter.''
There were moments in the 54-hole qualifying school at Peralda, Spain, that
made him wonder if it was going to make any difference. There were 38 putts in
an opening three-over-par 75, a score he repeated in the second round with 36
strokes on the greens. In the final round he was well over par to the turn and
his hopes looked forlorn, but suddenly he holed a long one and the broomhandle
turned into a magic wand.
He came back in 31, with six birdies, for a 69 to claim his ticket to a new
life with nothing to spare.
One thing that has not changed over the last 25 years is the high cost of
competing abroad, and Gray will be looking for a sponsor in the coming weeks.
He also hopes to step up his coaching role, his interest in this side of the
game having been encouraged by conversations on tour with the likes of Tommy
Horton and Brian Huggett, both of them established gurus.
From the start of the year onwards though, and in between his ongoing
commitment as a club pro, all will be geared towards May, when he dusts off his
passport and heads for the season opener in Turkey.
q GORDON Dalgleish, a former Scottish youth cap, has won his first national
title at the age of 33 in the fast-developing golfing nation of China.
The Georgia-based Dalgleish, a former member at Helensburgh, carded rounds of
72, 75, 73, and 73 over the 6800-yard, par-72 Jack Nicklaus design at Chung
Shan Hot Spring, just over the border from Macau, to win the tenth China Open
Amateur championship by nine strokes with a five-over-par aggregate.
Dalgleish, younger brother of Colin, captain of the Scottish men's amateur
team, combined the competition with a business trip to Asia to promote the golf
travel business, Perrygolf, which the pair operate.
``It was the first serious competition I have played in since the Scottish
Amateur two and a half years ago,'' said the one-handicapper, who now plays out
of the Reynolds Plantation club, near Atlanta, and plans to return to China
next year to defend.
Among past winners is Walker Cup player Gary Wolstenholme, who won over the
Arnold Palmer-designed course at the same club. This was the first time the
longer and typically heavily bunkered Nicklaus version had been used.
This year there was a field of 110 players, the vast majority of them Asian.

MURRAYFIELD would have been an ideal setting for Sunday's Coca-Cola Cup final,
Scottish Rugby Union chief executive Bill Hogg claimed yesterday.
The 67,500 all-seated stadium, which was completed almost exactly a year ago at
a cost of #41m, is now one of the finest sports stadiums in the world but,
according to the SRU, there is an apparent reluctance on the part of the
footballing authorities to make use of it.
Yesterday, at a Murrayfield media briefing, Hogg said that he was in regular
contact with his counterpart at the Scottish Football Association but, he said:
``We don't seem to have much clout there.
``Sunday's cup final featuring two east coast teams would have been ideal for
Murrayfield. It would have been much handier for Dundee and Aberdeen fans than
Hampden Park.''
Murrayfield is currently under-utilised with Scotland's two home games in the
Five Nations' Championship and a November visit by a touring side being the
only regular games.
The stadium has also been a venue for pop concerts, REM having played there and
Tina Turner scheduled to perform next June.
The Scottish Claymores American football side uses Murrayfield for its home
games, although it emerged yesterday that they would no longer use the stadium
for training.
Hogg added: ``We didn't speak specifically to the SFA about Sunday's game, but
we have mentioned to them the possibility of hosting semi-final or final games
when two east coast clubs were involved. Murrayfield is a very central venue
and easy to access.''
The issue of crowd segregation has cropped up in the past, but Hogg said:
"There is a facility for crowd segregation, so it is all there.''
SFA chief executive Jim Farry pointed out that Hampden is the National Stadium
and as such is the natural venue for all major cup finals. ``Of course, if a
situation arose where Murrayfield could be used in a football context then we
would be more than happy to take advantage of the stadium,'' he said.
``We admire the rugby      stadium, but I have to say that we do not suggest
that a West of Scotland and Kelso match should be played at Broadwood.''

ONE of this autumn's less edifying television spectacles was to see the head of
Yorkshire Water forced to admit the infrequency of his bathing arrangements as
he faced a media grilling about the water shortages in his area.
I wonder how many of you who saw his predicament felt any sympathy? No, neither
did I. But consider this. If we had been exposed to the glare of publicity,
could we have done any better?
Media awareness training until fairly recently was the province of the upwardly
mobile politician. These days - despite the cynics' view that it teaches one
about how to avoid answering direct questions - such training for managers is
very much in vogue.
With the scales now more equably balanced between reporter and subject, is it
surprising that we have reached the age of the totally bland interview that
evokes the same excitement as watching paint drying on a wall?
Offering some thoughts on the subject today is Mike Shaw (above left) who, as
programme development editor with BBC Radio Scotland, is responsible for
commissioning independent productions for the station.
TRADING places can be a useful, even humbling experience. Doctors, for example,
are reckoned to make the worst patients. Professional broadcasters, to be fair,
sometimes make less than ideal interviewees.
I was recently invited to appear on French radio during Radio Scotland's
extensive coverage of the Lorient Festival Interceltique in Britanny. The
request was actually relayed to me via a third party and I was never actually
informed what was wanted from me or whether the programme was live or recorded.
I wasn't even given the name of the person doing the interview, or, as it
transpired, the fact that he and his production team were several hundred miles
away in another studio. It was also only when I turned up the following morning
that I discovered that they also wanted a 30, not a three-minute discussion.
Then just as the recording started a small regiment of Scotland's finest pipers
and their Breton counterparts began warming up on the quay below our makeshift
studio for the festival championship to be held later that day. In other words,
all the pre-conditions were in place for the radio equivalent of the famous
Blue Peter interview with the elephant!
In his book Face the Press* John Lidstone is very much against doing what I
did. He warns against rushing into interviews and points out the need to
identify in advance precisely what is required of the interviewee. Find out the
likely audience; how will your interview be used - will it stand alone or, for
example, be part of a wider feature?
Nobody could argue with the general principles outlined here, and one would
expect most journalists to clear this territory in advance. On the other hand,
calls taken at home have been known to undermine the innocent, surrounded as
they are by familiar trappings and therefore less vigilant, as perhaps some
royal advisers are now contemplating.
The author also advocates making lists of positives and negatives before
agreeing to take part in an interview. The bottom line is what's in it for us?
His positives include general promotion of the company, enhancing its profile,
informing the community, and staff motivation.
Motivation? I once met an American telecommunications executive who had gone
public on the inadequacy of the service his company were providing, and who
promised to get things right. He calculated that his staff knew the truth of
the present difficulties and would appreciate honesty.
He got it right on both counts, which is doubtless one of the reasons why he
felt able to tell the story. In slightly different circumstances a certain Mr
Ratner got it rather badly wrong, and the rest is history. John Lidstone's
negatives include evaluation of similar risks to the company's name, its share
value and the interviewee's career.
The sum total of all this advice borders, though, on confirmation of a
conspiracy theory of all media relations. The executive who takes on board
every recommendation will be mentally dressed like the proverbial American
footballer. Lines over-rehearsed with corporate affairs can sound pretty
ordinary. Informed comment, delivered in a lively manner, is far superior.
It's not surprising that a small number of people appear so often in the press
and on radio and television. They're good and they're wanted back. There's a
further general moral in this for all organisations, and that's to avoid
getting hung up on status and hierarchy. Offer your best speaker. Apart from
anything else, the electronic media can be terribly cruel to the inadequate
performer.
Fortunately Lidstone avoids a fair amount of this overkill. He advocates
developing good relations with journalists, offers practical advice on how to
deal with what is ``on'' and ``off'' the record, and presents some extremely
useful and well-illustrated text on what to expect when you visit the
television and radio studio. The case studies are interesting and stimulate
thinking. He has obviously had some solid practical experience on which to base
his propositions.
For most people the chance to perform comes on rarely, so it's a good idea to
listen, watch and read as much as possible to get into the mindset of the
practitioners of different sectors of the media. You could do worse than start
with Lidstone.

SMALL football clubs will not suffer if the European Court of Justice accepts
advice to outlaw the player transfer system, claimed Advocate-General Carl Otto
Lenz yesterday in Brussels.
``Nobody is going to disappear,'' said Lenz, a lawyer who has advised the court
considering a case brought by Belgian player Jean-Marc Bosman that it should
declare European football's transfer system and limits on foreign players
illegal.
``The court could decide on a transitional period (to a more open system) of
five years,'' said Lenz, one of the court's chief legal advisers, at the end of
a European Parliament convention on sport. ``An end to clubs organising the
market would be best for everyone,'' he added.
But UEFA, the sport's governing body in Europe, told the convention that Lenz's
recommendations, if accepted by the court, could create a two-tier system of
clubs. Small clubs, which rely heavily on transfer payments, fear they will go
under in a free market.
``Football is not just about the big clubs and the great stars but also about
the thousands of clubs and the hundreds of thousands of players at every level
across the length and breadth of the Continent,'' said the presidents of the 49
national associations in UEFA in a letter read out at the convention.
The letter dismissed Lenz's proposal of safeguarding smaller clubs by
redistributing a percentage of all clubs' income. ``His proposed alternative,
that funds should be redistributed with nothing in return, is simply
unworkable,'' it said.
Yesterday's convention had no legal bearing on the court decision, which is
expected early next year.
Bosman's case began in 1990, when FC Liege of Belgium blocked his proposed
transfer to French club Dunkirk. Liege later suspended Bosman, who is now
seeking damages of about $1m from UEFA and the Belgian football union, claiming
he was unofficially blacklisted after starting the court case.
FIFA has expressed concern that European Union countries would be left out of
step with the rest of the world if the European court accepted Lenz's advice.

THE Princess of Wales arrived home from her Argentina visit yesterday to face
the fall-out from her Panorama TV interview.
She flew into Heathrow on a scheduled British Airways flight from Buenos Aires.
After her high-profile trip to South America, the princess faces strained
relations with other members of the royal family, who are still coping with the
shock waves from her television revelations.
Buckingham Palace officials have offered Diana talks to ``help define her
future role'' in public life ``and continue to support her as a member of the
royal family''.
They are anxious to avoid any vindictive exchange after the no-holds-barred
interview in which the princess confessed to adultery with ex-Life Guards
cavalry captain James Hewitt, cast doubt on her estranged husband's suitability
to be king, and claimed she was the victim of palace plotters.
However, the princess is expected to guard her newly-won independence jealously
and to resist attempts to control her.
For their part, palace officials will want to be seen to be fair and reasonable
when dealing with the mother of Prince William and Prince Harry and a woman who
appears to command strong public support.
The princess's visit to Argentina will inevitably be seen as a test of her
future role.
The so-called charity visit was under intense media scrutiny as Diana
encountered isolated but insistent protests, notably over the Falklands.
Almost every time there was a warm welcome, minority protesters spoilt things
for the princess.
James Hewitt remained in the spotlight yesterday. The Sun newspaper quoted him
as saying it was the princess herself who first urged him to speak out after it
became clear their fling was going to be discovered.
q The princess is to launch a 15-month appeal to raise money for the charity
ChildLine.
Another charity, the Eating Disorders Association, which helps people suffering
from the eating disorder which plagued the Princess of Wales, yesterday
announced that it was getting #32,000 from the National Lottery.

<TEXT>
AN eight-year-old boy may loose a foot after it was crushed in a wall collapse
- more than two years after neighbours first warned it was unsafe.
Lee MacMillan was out playing with a pal in Cranloch housing estate, Nairn,
when the wall fell on him, the impact from large concrete blocks from the 8ft
wall shattering bones and leaving a gaping wound in his left foot.
Doctors warned yesterday that, unless a difficult operation suc- ceeds, they
may have to amputate.
Paramedics took 15 minutes to free Lee from under the rubble before taking him
to Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, with his mother, Lynne.
Residents at Albyn Court, Nairn, where the accident took place, claim they have
been pressing owners, Albyn Housing, for more than two years to take action.
Ms MacMillan said yesterday: ``It is an absolute outrage this should happen to
my wee boy.''
``He is in a terrible condition and I am just praying he will not lose his
foot. He's such an active wee boy and loves playing football.
``I could not believe it when I heard yesterday the housing association had
deemed the wall safe. I believe they refused to take any action despite
warnings. Only now, after something serious like this, have they started
repairs.''
Ms MacMillan, of Seaforth Road, Nairn, added: ``I understand he is likely, at
the very least, to lose his big toe. There is also a real danger he will lose
his foot, especially if infection sets in.''
Mr Ronald Mackenzie, 72, of Albyn Court, who owns the house adjacent to the
collapsed wall, has led a campaign to have the wall repaired.
He said: ``The wall has been shakey for more than two years but, despite my
warnings, Albyn Housing have always maintained it is perfectly safe.
``The first time they came was more than two years ago now. I showed them
cracks in the wall but they said it was fine.''
No-one at Albyn Housing was available for comment yesterday.

EXCLUSIVE
SCOTTISH Office Ministers have agreed to an even tougher than expected
crackdown on any increases in water charges to be levied by the three new
public authorities next year.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth is ready to step in and cap the rises at an
average of just 6%.
The new water authorities believed they might be allowed increases of up to 15%
before the Scottish Office intervened. They have not officially been told of
the Scottish Secretary's intentions.
Rises of around 6% would be slightly less than the average increases levied by
the regional councils over the last few years and would destroy Labour's
claims, at least for the time being, that removing the services from local
authority control would send charges soaring.
Yesterday Labour's local government spokesman, Mr John McAllion, was accusing
the Government of lying about the real cost of transferring water and sewerage
services from councils to the new quangos.
Mr McAllion said: ``Every step taken away from direct public control and
towards privatisation is a step which costs consumers dearly. That is the truth
which Scottish Office Ministers dare not own up to.''
Such a tight charging limit, however, will present the new water and sewerage
authorities with enormous problems.
The chairman of the West of Scotland Water Authority, Mr John Jameson, said it
would be ``very difficult'' to make savings of such an order in the authority's
first year of operation.
He said spending would have to rise by around 10% to 15% and it was hard to see
where cutbacks could come. The largest part of the increase was taken up by
paying interest on the capital debt and in paying rates to councils for the
installations inherited by the authority.
Mr Jameson said he believed the board would be very unhappy to see major
reductions in the capital spending programme which could place them in legal
difficulties over meeting deadlines for reaching new Government and European
Union standards.
Ministers are also anxious to encourage the new authorities to enter into
partnerships with the private sector over major new capital projects through
the Private Finance Initiative. The preferred method is through Build Own and
Operate (BOO) schemes.
However, Mr Jameson said no such projects were on the stocks in the Strathclyde
and Dumfries and Galloway area which his board covers and it would take at
least a year to get one set up.
No-one was available to comment at the East of Scotland Authority yesterday. It
is believed however that ESWA faces a serious lack of funding in its first year
and cannot call on any reserves. It is believed to need a rise of around 25% to
meet its requirements although it recognises this increase would not be
acceptable.
The charges proposed by the three new authorities should be known next month
when they will be submitted to the Scottish Water and Sewerage Consumers'
Council chaired by former Labour MP and now SNP member Dick Douglas.
If the Council, which acts as a public watchdog, cannot agree the level of
increases the matter passes to the Scottish Secretary.

HERITAGE Secretary Virginia Bottomley has expressed concern about the BBC's
attitude to the evening watershed. She has made it clear that she is unhappy
about the way family viewing can suddenly become adult viewing at the stroke of
9pm, a time when many children are still watching television.
Instead she wants the corporation to make a slower switch after 9 o'clock, a
period of transition which would prevent youngsters from seeing scenes of sex
and violence.
Mrs Bottomley's opinion, which is aimed more at BBC2 since BBC1 has the Nine
o'Clock News ``buffer zone'' on weekdays, was expressed yesterday as she
announced her detailed proposals for the corporation's new charter. However,
fears that she was preparing to issue stringent and prohibitive new rules on
taste and decency proved to be largely unfounded.
Indeed the BBC management and, more to the point, its programme-makers broadly
welcomed the proposals which, in effect, amounted to a massive vote of
confidence in the corporation.
Broadcasters seemed to accept the more controversial aspects of Mrs Bottomley's
draft. Among the main principles in the Government's proposals for a new
Charter and Agreement will be ``clarification of the BBC's responsibilities for
impartiality and for taste and decency''.
This clause is part of a list of ``basic programme standards'' which merely
places the corporation under the same obligations as its counterparts in the
commercial sector. Until now the BBC has been subject to a voluntary code of
practice; now it will be formally incorporated into the agreement.
Mrs Bottomley also proposes a more explicit role for the Board of Governors
which would ensure that ``the BBC meets its obligations and commitments to
licence-fee payers''. This would include overseeing strategy, supervising on
matters of programme standard and impartiality, ensuring the proper handling of
complaints, and appointing senior staff.
There would also be a requirement for the BBC to publish a ``Statement of
Pledges'' outlining the objectives and the standards which viewers could
expect. It would also be obliged to report on performance and achievement. All
of these things the BBC already does (usually through its annual report) but,
again, these proposals formalise the requirements.
Important to Scotland is a clause which lays down a concrete commitment to
regional broadcasting by providing a greater role for programme makers
throughout the country. There will also be specific responsibilities laid down
for the National Broadcasting Councils for Scotland, Wales, and Northern
Ireland. Behind this is the growing awareness that the BBC has been too
centralised - and unable to look beyond London and the Home Counties.
Once again, Mrs Bottomley is making formal a process which the BBC has been
doing in recent years with its increasing commitment to both regional and
network programmes.
Much more significant, however, is that for the first time the Board of
Governors will be required to consult the National Broadcasting Council for
Scotland on matters of programme objectives, the allocation of funding, and any
proposals which would have a significant effect on BBC Scotland's resource
base. A senior official at BBC Scotland described the proposal as a ``step
forward'' because it gave the council a much more defined role.
Mrs Bottomley also confirmed yesterday that the BBC's transmission services
would be privatised, with the revenue from the sale being returned to the
corporation for re-investment in new digital production technology.
Commenting on the draft Charter and Agreement, she said: ``The BBC is a
national jewel. It is internationally recognised as the leading broadcaster in
the world. The BBC has a justifiable reputation for making quality programmes.
``The draft Charter and Agreement demonstrates the Government's commitment to
building on the BBC's proud tradition of public service broadcasting, while
freeing it to meet the challenges of the multi-media, digital future.
``The new charter will make the BBC more clearly accountable to licence-fee
payers. There should be dialogue, understanding, and accountability between the
BBC and its audiences.''
She pledged that the corporation's independence was enshrined within the new
agreement but editorial independence required editorial responsibility. Viewers
expected information and stimulating debate.
``They have the right to expect that the assumptions and motives of all those
who enter the arena of political debate will be challenged and questioned in a
sensible, constructive way. The new Charter and Agreement provides a framework
for this to be achieved,'' she added.
BBC Chairman Marmaduke Hussey welcomed the Heritage Secretary's draft
proposals. ``We are delighted that the all-party support given to the BBC when
the White Paper was published last year is fully reflected in these new
documents. This vote of confidence in the BBC, and those who work for it at all
levels, represents the fruits of many years' labour to prepare the corporation
for the challenges of the next century,'' he said.
The draft Charter and Agreement will now face its passage through the Commons
and the Lords. The current BBC charter runs out at the end of next year.

FEARING an erosion of standards across the European drinks industry, the Scotch
Whisky Association has thrown its support behind a Spanish complaint against
English brandy made from cider.
The association set out its views in response to a Ministry of Agriculture
inquiry, asking whether ``cider brandy'' was a recognised term within the
drinks industry. The UK is examining the issue in response to a Spanish
complaint to the European Commission about Somerset Cider Brandy Company's use
of the word ``brandy'' to describe distilled cider.
Julian Temperley, the managing director of the small six-year-old company,
called the whisky association's response ``bad policy, incompetent and
treacherous.''
``We are somewhat surprised and hurt to be attacked by people who are supposed
to be our colleagues,'' Mr Temperley said. ``It doesn't do anybody any
favours.''
Campbell Evans of the Scotch Whisky Association said his group was not
interested in changing the regulations, merely clarifying them. He said the
association was concerned that the ``knock-on'' effects of widening the
definition of brandy would set a damaging precedent for whisky.
``We fight all over the world against passing off spirits which do not meet the
definition of whisky as being such,'' Mr Evans said. ``If exceptions are
allowed in one area, they can spill over into other areas - like Scotch
whisky.''
The Scotch Whisky Association outlined its position to the Ministry of
Agriculture in a letter dated November 10. Part of that letter, which was
obtained by Somerset Cider Brandy, reads as follows:
``Spanish spirits producers have long objected to the use of the term `brandy'
for a product which is not wine-based. We understand that, initially, it was
only the English (mis)translation of (European Union) Regulation 1576/89 which
caused them problems.
``Since brandy is defined by Regulation 1576/89 (and is understood by consumers
worldwide) as being a spirit drink distilled from wine spirit, the terms
`cherry brandy liqueur,' `cider brandy' and `grain brandy' are contradictory
and misleading. We would definitely not wish to see the term `whisky' used on
spirits produced from raw materials other than cereals.''
Mr Temperley said this rationale did not make sense because European Commission
definitions did not exclude wines made from fruits other than grapes. If wine
can be made from apples, then cider brandy is a legitimate label for distilled
apple juice, he argued.
``If whisky was produced from one type of grain maybe you could support the
Spanish,'' Mr Temperley said in a letter to the whisky association, ``but by
allowing the production from any cereal can only support our case that brandy
can be produced from any fruit.''
The dispute comes up for the European Commission's consideration in January.
Mr Temperley said he expected strong support from French producers of Calvados,
another spirit made from apples.

<HEADLINE>Old Bailey judge shows leniency to single mother indulging `selfish wish' Woman who left baby to die is freed</HEADLINE>

A MOTHER whose six-month-old daughter died when she was left in a flat alone
for 30 hours without food or water was allowed to walk free from the Old Bailey
yesterday.
Single mother Antoinette Campbell, 23, was indulging her selfish wish ``for a
bit of freedom'' when she left her baby, Desrae, to spend time with her
boyfriend.
However, the court heard how doctors could not agree on the cause of the baby's
death and how she could have fallen victim to cot-death syndrome within hours
of being left.
Campbell was put on probation for three years on condition she lives at a bail
hostel and attends a probation centre.
The judge told her: ``This is an opportunity the court will not be able to
repeat but it's an opportunity you need now and which the court wishes you to
have now, so I hope there will be no need for you to come before a court ever
again.''
He said it was clear from numerous reports that people wanted to help Campbell,
and the court wanted to help her too.
Campbell had admitted child cruelty at an earlier hearing and had been remanded
for reports.
Her plea of not guilty to the manslaughter of her baby was accepted by the
Crown after Mr Mark Dennis, prosecuting, said doctors could not agree on the
cause of death.
Although a pathologist had found signs of dehydration and starvation, two
paediatricians disagreed that these factors were the cause of death.
They decided the baby girl had died only a few hours after her mother had
abandoned her at her newly-acquired council flat in Kilburn, north-west London,
either from cot death syndrome or a metabolic disorder.
Mr Dennis said it was impossible to quantify how much the stress of abandonment
had had on these natural causes of death.
He told the court that, before the incident in January this year, Campbell had
complained to her mother that she felt lifeless.
She asked her mother to look after the baby for a couple of hours. On several
occasions, she returned much later than arranged, telling her mother ``it feels
good, it's some freedom''.
``In other words, without the child,'' added Mr Dennis.
When the baby died, Campbell left her early on Friday evening and went to visit
her boyfriend, the baby's father.
She pretended to him and his family that her mother was looking after Desrae.
Campbell stayed the night and did not return to her own home until late on
Saturday night.
Mr Dennis said that, while Campbell was at her boyfriend's home, she appeared
perfectly normal and not at all distressed.
She stayed all the next day but then she said she missed her baby and wanted to
pick her up from her mother's. En route, she called at a friend's and did not
get home until late on Saturday night. She found Desrae dead.
Campbell left the baby's body wrapped in a shawl and went to her mother's house
without revealing what had happened.
The baby was found by her father, who became concerned at a phone call he had
received and climbed into the flat.
Campbell appeared later accompanied by counsellors from the Samaritans, whom
she had contacted, and a doctor.
Campbell admitted to police she had abandoned her baby. She said she had only
intended to stay for a while at her boyfriend's because he had complained in
the past about her bringing the child and not getting a babysitter.
She had not left Desrae with her mother because she did not want her to think
she was ``taking liberties''.
``When she (Desrae) wasn't there, it was providing her with a bit of freedom, a
bit of space, a bit of thinking time. She admits it was no excuse and that she
was being selfish in all she has done,'' Mr Jeremy Dein, defending, told the
court.

Canadian leader
woos Quebec
OTTAWA: Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien yesterday announced three
measures to try to mollify Quebec separatists, including a parliamentary
resolution recogizing that Quebec is a distinct society.
But the resolution fell short of demands of the separatists and proposals by
Chretien's own Liberal colleagues in Quebec for insertion of a clause on a
distinct society in the constitution.
Tamil appeal
COLOMBO: The leader of Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels admitted yesterday the army
might take his stronghold of Jaffna but said the door to peace would be closed
so long as troops occupied the town. He appealed for fresh recruits to join his
guerrilla forces as the military blasted through the town's booby-trapped maze
of streets with tanks.
Taking over
PARIS: Algeria's newly-elected president Liamine Zeroual was sworn in yesterday
and urged all political groups in the fractured country to engage in dialogue
and respect the law. But, in a much anticipated speech, he avoided committing
himself to negotiations with Muslim militants fighting the government or to
specific dates for parlimentary elections.
Nastase move
BUCHAREST: Former tennis star Ilie Nastase entered has entered a new ball game,
politics, becoming a leading member of Romania's ruling party. Nastase, 49, the
world's No 1 player in 1973, has been elected to the national council of the
centre-left Social Democracy Party, said party spokesman Ilie Petrescu in
Bucharest.
Fraud retrial
BERNE: A Swiss court yesterday completed a posthumous retrial of a police chief
convicted of fraud in 1940 for helping Jews fleeing the Nazis and said a
verdict would be announced on Thursday. Former Jewish refugees who attended the
hearing said they were confident a sentence on Paul Grueninger, who died in
1972 aged 80, for falsifying entry documents would be cancelled and that he
would be fully rehabilitated.
Green look
COPENHAGEN: Danes packed a provincial museum to glimpse a 10-week-old kitten
born with fluorescent green fur, apparently from a genetic defect. Newspapers
carried pictures of the cat's owner, Kristinne Bischoff, five, holding her pet,
Miss Greeny, during an appearance at Aarhus Natural History Museum, on the
Jutland peninsula. Investigators appear convinced that the cat's fur is not
dyed and are analysing blood samples to find the genetic reasons for its colour.
Market inferno
DHAKA: Soldiers were called in to help firemen put out a devastating fire that
destroyed nearly 2500 shops yesterday in one of Dhaka's largest markets.
Witnesses said hundreds of soldiers joined the fight after Bangladesh Prime
Minister Begum Khaleda Zia and opposition leader Sheikh Hasina visited the fire
scene.
Good spirits
SINGAPORE: Former Barings Bank trader Nick Leeson appeared in good spirits in
his maximum security prison in Singapore yesterday, his lawyer told reporters.
``He seemed cheerful,'' lawyer John Koh said, emerging from Tanah Merah prison
after spending nearly an hour inside. His next court appearance is on Friday.

THE former Scotland captain David Sole is to appear before the Murrayfield
authorities tomorrow as the investigation continues into his comments after
Edinburgh Academicals' premiership clash with Melrose when he was reported to
have declared that the performance of referee Colin Henderson had been
``tantamount to cheating.''
Academicals' coach Sole was upset by a string of penalty awards against his
side - subsequently relegated to Division II - who were beaten in the final
minute and, at the time, plunged deeper into the relegation mire by the defeat.
Yesterday, Academicals' media spokesman Magnus Moodie said: ``The delicate
balance between freedom of speech and maintaining the rugby ethic will be put
to the test on Wednesday when David Sole, president Charlie Jackson, and Ken
Lauder will have a meeting with the SRU on the subject of David's comments. The
invitation to the meeting was very friendly and sympathetic to our recent
difficulties.''
SRU chief executive Bill Hogg said yesterday: ``We have been in discussion with
Academicals about the reported comments by David Sole and we want to discuss
the matter with them personally rather than conduct a correspondence.''
Hogg, who said at the time of the incident that any action taken against Sole
would be handled under the catch-all ``bringing the game into disrepute,''
declared yesterday that the sanctions available to the union were the same as
those when a player was involved.
q THE SRU expect to be a step nearer making the crucial decision on whether
club or district sides represent Scotland in the European Cup next season after
a meeting in Dublin today, when the organisers will hammer out fixture dates
for the 20-team tournament.
The inaugural championship, involving 16 sides from Wales, Ireland, France,
Italy and Romania - but not England or Scotland - is currently under way.
Ireland are represented by provincial sides and current thinking at Murrayfield
is that Scotland should follow suit, either with recognised districts or with
hybrid sides comprising the best players available.
The clubs versus districts issue is potentially divisive, with some of the top
clubs determined that they, and not districts, should fly the Saltire in Europe.
Yesterday, at a Murrayfield media briefing, SRU chief executive Bill Hogg said
that discussions were ongoing with the Premier League Clubs Association, but
only after the format of the tournament was known would it be possible to
resolve the issue.
``We hope that a consensus will emerge. The alternatives will be put to the
clubs. Ultimately the SRU committee will decide but, hopefully, that decision
can be reached in agreement with the clubs,'' he said.
Hogg added that the ideal scenario would be to play the club championship, then
the European ties - which the SRU hope will be at weekends and not midweek, as
they are just now - and then move on to the Five Nations' tournament. The hope
was that the inter-district championship could still be fitted into the
equation.
The situation is further complicated because of ongoing discussion about the
premiership format next season. The possibility of 10-team divisions is still
being discussed but, said Hogg, if the premiership divisions were increased
from eight to 18 clubs, then there was ``no way'' that the inter-district
championship and the European ties could be fitted in.
q FINAL decisions on the contract issued to the international squad now await
the outcome of legal advice sought by the players. The SRU said yesterday that
there were now no unresolved issues of principle, so far as they were
concerned. The chief executive said that it was not the intention to make
public the value of the contract - which other sources put at a maximum of
around #22,500 for the season - as it was a private matter between the union
and the players.
q THE SRU is not insisting that premiership fixtures which have no bearing on
the title chase or relegation should be played on December 9 and 16. Hogg said
yesterday that the Gala v Heriot's FP fixture did not need to be played on
December 9 and the Union was recommending to the clubs that the Heriot's FP v
Stirling County game, which does have a bearing on the championship, should be
played on December 9 rather than a week later as currently scheduled.
q PROFESSOR Michael Garraway, of Edinburgh University, is to receive #16,000
funding from the SRU for further research into injuries suffered by players.
His initial investigation into the causes and outcome of rugby injuries in the
South of Scotland will be followed up.
q THE Scottish Claymores gridiron side will no longer use Murrayfield for
training. Their decision means a revenue loss of some #10,000 to the SRU.

GARY Armstrong, who makes a guest appearance for Newcastle-Gosforth tonight as
the Tynesiders entertain the Transvaal provincial side from South Africa, has
agreed a financial deal with Sir John Hall's super-club, and expects to make a
permanent move in January.
Armstrong, capped 30 times, and fellow Borderer Doddie Weir have been involved
in negotiations with Sir John and Newcastle's rugby director Rob Andrew for
some time.
The Scottish guest will play in the second half at Newcastle tonight.
Yesterday, Armstrong declared: ``I've now agreed the cash side of the deal.
There are other bits and pieces to sort out, and the contract is with my
lawyer, but, if there are no last-minute hitches, then I don't envisage any
problems.''
The Jed-Forest, Scotland, and British Lions scrum half was initially offered
around #150,000, plus fringe benefits, for a three-year deal. He declined to
say yesterday whether negotiations had led to an increase in cash.
``The contract will be for three years and four games. Rob wants us down in
January so that we can play in the final four league games. It's crucial, of
course, that Newcastle remain in Division II.
``Everything that I have seen at Newcastle has impressed me. Their facilities
are fantastic, and both Rob Andrew and Sir John have great vision for the
future. They want to make Newcastle the biggest club in the country and they
are determined that we will play in Europe,'' he said.
The Jedburgh lorry driver added: ``Of course, it will be a wrench to leave
Jed-Forest, but I won't have to leave the town, and the club have said that I
go with their blessing. Of course it's a gamble, but it's a gamble that I'm
willing to take. I really couldn't walk away from what they are offering me.
``They have said that they will train me as a sales rep if I want to. The club
has a link with Scottish and Newcastle Brewers through the football club, but I
don't know yet whether I'll take them up on that. Maybe, I should just
concentrate on the rugby initially.''
Weir, who will not play today for Newcastle because of Melrose's crunch
premiership match with Gala on Saturday, added: ``I'm in much the same position
as Gary. The contract is with the lawyer and I have to speak to my boss here at
Carlsberg-Tetley, because I would like to keep on my job as a sales rep in the
Borders.
``There are still things like that to sort out but if all goes to plan, then I
expect to be at Newcastle next year as well.''
q.A GARY Armstrong try gave South, under the guise of the Edinburgh Borderers,
a 5-3 half-time lead over the home club in an exhibition match to mark the
switching on the new Peebles RFC floodlights last night.
Two tries from Hawick winger Keith Suddon, and one from Graeme Aitchison, took
the South clear in the second half. Kelso full back Aitchison added two
conversions as South won 24-3, Peebles stand-off Rab Wilson having kicked his
side's only points in the first half.

<HEADLINE>Applicant for asylum wins #3000 after detention</HEADLINE>

A BANGLADESHI Hindu seeking political asylum in Scotland has won damages from
the Home Office in what is thought to be the first successful legal challenge
of its kind.
Mr Bizan Bhattacharjee, who is living in Fort William, won #3000 for being
wrongly detained after he had been arrested for breaching bail restrictions.
The settlement has been agreed out of court and will be rubber-stamped at the
Court of Session on Thursday when the case is concluded formally. The Home
Office does not accept liability.
Lawyers acting for Mr Bhattacharjee said it was believed to be the first
successful claim in Scotland against the Home Office under the 1971 Immigration
Act. Only a handful of actions are thought to have been successful south of the
Border.
Mr Bhattacharjee, 36, said he was relieved at the result and now hoped his
application for asylum would be accepted so that he could start a new life in
Fort William.
The single man arrived in the UK four years ago after facing persecution from
the majority Muslim population in Bangladesh. He also claims his father was
killed by extremists in the country.
He was detained on his arrival into the UK but granted bail while his case was
investigated. An immigration adjudicator said he had to remain at a London
address and pay a surety of #2000.
After an argument with one friend in London, Mr Bhattacharjee looked up another
contact in Fort William and began working in a restaurant there. He was aware
he had breached bail conditions but felt he had no alternative.
In January this year, he was arrested by police and immigration officers and
taken first to Fort William police cells then to Greenock Prison. The
authorities failed to bring him before an adjudicator within the stipulated 24
hours, waiting five days before a hearing went ahead.
He was sent back to Greenock for a month before being granted interim
liberation, pending a decision on his asylum application.
His lawyer, Mr Dilip Deb, explained that the #3000 damages was for the extra
period he spent in prison awaiting a hearing before an adjudicator.
Mr Deb said: ``Greenock is an ordinary prison where my client was locked up for
most of the day and then forced to mix with other inmates, criminals, and
people awaiting trial. He had to wear prison clothes and eat Western food.
``It is unusual for the Home Office to detain someone illegally and that makes
this an even more important result.''
Mr Deb said his client had been made a fair offer which he would accept.
Mr Bhattacharjee said his first days behind bars had been the most frightening.
He said: ``I was very upset when I was taken away from the restaurant in
handcuffs but prison was frightening. I felt as if I was being treated like a
murderer.
``I have never been in prison in my life and I was constantly afraid. I
suffered verbal abuse and once someone tried to grab a chain from around my
neck.
``It was God's blessing that I was released from jail. I love this country and
now I want to stay. I hope the Government will grant me asylum. I have forgiven
and forgotten those involved in my prison ordeal.''
Mr Deb said his client's application for asylum should be dealt with in the
coming months.
A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: ``We are not accepting liability. It
was an out-of-court settlement and we believe it represents the best public
interest.'' It is understood the Home Office was not prepared to spend public
money on a costly trial.
Greenock's governor, Mr Damiel Gunn, said it was not mandatory for untried
prisoners to wear prison clothing. He added that everything was done to meet
the needs of inmates detained under immigration legislation. Greenock is the
main holding centre used by immigration authorities in Scotland.

FORGET the arithmetic. Glasgow may already have three twin cities but it won't
deter the city from adding a fourth - Benidorm.
The twinning was proposed yesterday by the Mayor of Benidorm, Mr Vicente
Perez-Devesa, at a private meeting with Glasgow Lord Provost Tommy Dingwall.
Mr Perez-Devesa was in the city on the first leg of a glad-handing visit which
will take him to Edinburgh today, and Newcastle tomorrow, to bang the drum for
what is already Spain's number one holiday destination.
When it was first mooted that he should meet the lord provost, Mr Perez-Devesa
was told that a full diary precluded such an encounter.
However, it appears that Mr Dingwall is an aficionado of Spain. So much so that
yesterday's meeting at the City Chambers which had been scheduled for 15
minutes ran over to 90 and saw the lord provost tie a tartan tie round the
mayor's neck. It would appear that the idea of twinning Glasgow with the costas
was not simply a Spanish notion.
One of the six strong Spanish delegation, Mr Juan Ruiz, director of tourism in
Benidorm, said that they had just beaten Mr Dingwall to the punch.
Glasgow already has three twin cities - Nuremberg in Germany, Dalian in China,
and Rostov-on-Don in Russia, while Benidorm has a similar hat trick of Bad Ems
in Germany, Vina del Mar in Chile, and Le Cannet in France. But this it appears
will not stop the cities from adding a fourth. Through an interpreter Mr
Perez-Devesa told The Herald: ``For twinning to be a good idea there has to be
a contrast.''
And what better contrast could he hope for than Glasgow, where the sun mainly
shines from Mr Happy's mouth, and the city where it shines constantly from the
skies. The idea mooted is just that. Mr Perez-Devesa said he had been assured
that Mr Dingwall would take it further - once certain Glasgow District Council
officials had returned from an unconnected trip to Spain. He said that Benidorm
was in confident mood after the success of this summer's season. ``Although the
industry is predicting that next year will be a difficult one we are looking to
maintain our market share and attract about 100,000 visitors from Scotland.''
To maintain its number one position the resort has spent more than #20m
improving facilities and upgrading hotels rather than allowing new ones to be
built. With the completion of the 52-storey Hotel Bali in 1997 (which will
become Spain's tallest building) no new hotels are being built.
While he found Mr Dingwall to be a fervent admirer of Spain, the mayor saw
nothing wrong with the idea of Spaniards coming to Scotland for a holiday.
``Many Spaniards go on ski-ing holidays to the Pyrenees so I don't see why they
should not come to Scotland.''
He had, however, one complaint about our November weather. Too cold? No, just
the opposite. It appears that the Spanish delegation had come to Scotland
burdened with heavy jumpers and heavy boots in anticipation of the cold weather.
``We had been looking forward to it,'' said the mayor.
However, it would seem that frosty receptions are a thing of the past in
Scotland as far as the Spanish are concerned.

THE Chancellor of the Exchequer's approach to Europe and to the planned
introduction of a single European currency is finely judged and entirely
sustainable. He is determined to keep Britain's options open, which means
refusing to rule out the possibility of taking part in a single currency if it
is to Britain's advantage. Similarly, he manages to ensure that the
negotiations on a single currency are not allowed to prejudice Britain's
interests through sins of omission or commission on the part of our more
enthusiastic European partners.This is an interesting balancing act and one
which must always take into account the views of the Tory backwoodsmen, ever
ready to seek out signs of weakness on the Government's part or malevolence on
the part of the Europeans.  Such an issue surfaced yesterday in the form of the
first chance to discuss seriously the German proposal to penalise those nations
which take part in a single currency and then allow their inflation rates and
budget deficits to get out of control.  At first glance this is a subject
tailor-made  for the frothing tendency in the ranks of the Eurosceptics.  It
smacks of German arrogance (how dare they suggest fining other nations) and of
European designs on national sovereignty (the commission is believed to favour
it).
There is, of course, a quite different agenda involved in all of this.
Public
opinion in Germany is not wholly enthusiastic on the subject of a single
currency, not because its theoretical advantages are doubted but rather because
Germans fear that the bad habits and weak currencies of other nations might
drag down their own economy.  In an attempt to bolster flagging public support
the German Finance Minister, Mr Theo Waigel, proposed a "stability pact" for
enforcing budgetary discipline among member states taking part in monetary
union. The idea has been well-received in Germany for the obvious and intended
reasons, but it has also found support in other European countries.  At one
level it is one of those "good things" which it is difficult to argue against;
after all, what could be wrong with budgetary discipline?  Mr Clarke is aware
of this but has thankfully avoided the temptation to indulge in a little ersatz
indignation.  He dismissed the subject lightly by saying that it does not
constitute much of a threat to British sovereignty, which is true, and that in
any case Britain is set on an economic course which would not incur penalties.
The last point remains to be proved but the tone set by the Chancellor was
perfect.
More serious is the reminder from yesterday's meeting of Finance Ministers
that the Madrid Euro summit is next month and at that meeting the Prime
Minister will come face-to-face with the subject of the single currency. This
will give objectors on the Tory back benches ample opportunity to scrutinise Mr
Major's Eurosceptic credentials.  He may feel the hot breath of the
anti-European extremists on his neck, but he can hardly forget that the biggest
survey of British business opinion ever taken on the subject of the single
currency found solid support, either for participation or for maintaining the
option to join.  In any sensible world the opinion of British businessmen
should outweigh the opinion of the extremists, but Mr Major does not inhabit a
sensible world; he is the leader of the Tory Party.  The role model which he
should adopt is that of his Chancellor.  Yes, it is a balancing act, but it is
also pragmatic and leans to the positive side.  If Mr Major truly puts nation
above party next month he will do the same.

Author Raymond Chandler, with his wisecracking cop Philip Marlowe, has joined
America's giants of literature. Douglas Thompson investigates the man and his
lethal .38 epigrams
She had a lot of face and chin. She had pewter-coloured hair set in a ruthless
permanent, a hard beak and large moist eyes with the sympathetic expression of
wet stones. There was lace at her throat, but it was the kind of throat that
would have looked better in a football sweater.
- from The High Window.
RAYMOND CHANDLER, the loner's laureate, believed style was the best investment
a writer could make for posterity. He elevated himself from pulp fiction to use
the genre for his own artistic ends.
His work, just seven novels and a handful of short stories and screenplays, was
in a voice-over world of cool blondes and stiff whisky and vice versa. The
spiritual and emotional questions of his times he tackled on the streets.
To walk them he created his tarnished knight, Philip Marlowe, who used
wisecracks as a shield to - among other ``weaknesses'' - disguise his soft spot
for making other people's troubles his own. Marlowe was no brain-boiler like
Sherlock Holmes or cavalier James-Bond type. He was first named Mallory - a nod
to Le Morte d'Arthur - and Chandler saw him as sensitive and strong: ``He is
slightly over six feet tall and weighs about 13 stone eight. He has dark brown
hair, brown eyes, and the expression `passably good looking' would not satisfy
him in the least. He can be tough.
``Almost any sort of cigarette will satisfy him. He will drink practically
anything that is not sweet. Certain drinks, such as Pink Ladies, Honolulu
cocktails, and creme de menthe highballs, he would regard as an insult.
``He is a late riser by inclination, but occasionally an early riser by
necessity. He has not, and never has had, a secretary.
``He started out with a Luger automatic pistol. He seems to have had Colt
automatics of various calibres but not larger than a .38 and when I last heard
he had a Smith and Wesson .38 special.''
Here we had the private eye and public conscience.
``Cops are just people,'' she said. ``They start out that way I've heard.''
Chandler thought Cary Grant would be perfect to play his ``shop-soiled
Galahad'' in the movies.
It seems that everybody but Grant has but it was Bogart in The Big Sleep who
pulled that trench coat belt tight and put a patent on the image.
The bespectacled, pipe-smoking Chandler, meek, shy, and uncertain, provided the
poetry with five o'clock shadow, the arsenic idealism. His was unique material
which he also developed in screenplays for Billy Wilder (the classic Double
Indemnity) and Hitchcock (Strangers on a Train) but under financial duress.
His view of Hollywood was this: ``The making of motion pictures is an endless
contention of tawdry egos, almost none of them capable of anything more
creative than credit stealing and self promotion.''
Chandler was no self-publicist. He was reluctant even to release photographs of
himself, afraid that readers expecting a macho-man author might be put off by
his owlish look. He made no public appearances. Cinema's infant, television,
held no attraction for him (a Philip Marlowe series ran one season in 1959, the
year of his death) and he stayed at home. He spent his time drinking. And
writing. But letters as well as detective novels. The price of a stamp could
entice a few thousand words of Chandler in reply.
His letters make as fascinating reading as his ``work''. Now, more than a
century after his birth in Chicago in December, 1888, they have been gathered
along with the out-of-print screenplay of Double Indemnity and his novels and
short stories into two volumes.
Yes, many authors have been ``collected''. But not by the Library of America,
which is the resting place for the nation's giants of literature. It's a sort
of Booker Prize-type of tomb. You don't have to be read to get there.
Chandler is not only the first detective writer to be inaugurated but the first
pop-star wordsmith. The only other practitioner holding vaguely his view of the
world on the library's list is Edgar Allan Poe. The two Chandler volumes (2275
pages, $35 each, Library of America) don't take up much space on the shelf but
they are gems in the hands. Every page has some magic. The Library of America
volumes - they are modelled on the portable French Pleiades editions - take
Chandler's oeuvre, the work of a man who prided himself on being an inside
outsider, into the Establishment.
Style eventually delivered posterity in spades.
And you must spin a coin in the air about whether quality or influence are the
most important. Chandler has - apart from Hemingway - inspired more parodies
than any writer this century. He's also been a posthumous mentor to novelists
and film-makers from the worldwide film-noir crowd to Tarantino.
He's a novel in himself. His mother took him to England after her divorce. He
went to Dulwich College (as did P G Wodehouse) and it was all Greek and Latin
for him. After the First World War he returned to America, California and the
oil business. He went on booze binges and watched the shady deals going on.
He was on his way to the executive suite when his mother died and he met Cissy
Pascal. He was so obsessed with her that he didn't realise - or care - that she
was 17 years older when they married.
Love trapped him. Her health failed and in a string of lonely houses throughout
southern California he made the tea for her and a strong drink for himself. He
would take her for drives. For four hours a day he would shut himself up and
write. He never plotted - it shows - and for every 30,000 words he would edit
down to about one-sixth of that. He wrote about something he knew - Los Angeles.
The fiction was Marlowe or the men like him. When he was stuck he said his way
out was always to have a man come through a door with a gun in his hand.
There was a small knocking on wood. It was a blonde. A blonde to make a bishop
kick a hole in a stained-glass window.
Chandler had been amused at the antics of middle-class snobs in England, while
at the same time delighting in British eccentricity. When he returned to
America he felt socially superior. He didn't play on that but he did on his
intellectual arrogance. It was power, but he had no self-confidence that he
could be a writer and that ``saved'' him from the literary treadmill.
Writing detective stories were Erle Stanley Gardner and Dashiel Hammett, while
Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald were dazzling readers.
Chandler decided to take them all on.
He wrote his own rules, including the harnessing of your language to a
descriptive style that could be understood by a boy of 14 and appreciated by a
emeritus professor who revered the merits of clear, immaculately punctuated
English. It was a lonely struggle. His marriage, Cissy, ruled his life. His
escape was the typewriter and the bottle. As his wife lay slowly wasting away
in the next room he worked handicapped by the taxman's demands and his doubts
about his talent. He sipped and gulped his drinks and tapped away.
Fitzgerald died by the bottle. Hemingway blew his brains out. Chandler kept
writing. He never shot anyone - even himself. He botched his suicide attempt.
Cissy died in 1954 and Chandler might as well have gone with her. He survived
another five years but they were maudlin months and his work efforts were
despairing.
Unlike all the jet-setting authors of today who ``do'' research, Chandler just
wrote about what he knew - California and the money and excess he'd witnessed
in the oil business, the complications and compulsions wealth can bring even,
or maybe especially, in the sunshine. To Hollywood he imported foreign
substances with him from Europe - irony and morality. He used the simile like a
sword. Nothing was itself. Everything was like something else.
She smelled the way the Taj Mahal looked by midnight.
The Library of America titles would have irked Chandler. They are: Raymond
Chandler: Stories and Early Novels and Raymond Chandler: Later Novels and Other
Writings.
He got annoyed at those who refused to believe that the private-eye/detective
genre has both craft and style.
``A writer who hates the actual writing, who gets no joy out of the creation of
magic by words, to me is simply not a writer at all.
``The actual writing is what you live for. The rest is something you have to
get through in order to arrive at the point. How can you hate the actual
writing? How can you hate the magic which makes up a paragraph or a sentence or
a line of dialogue or a description of something in the nature of a new
creation?''
Strangely, his decades-ago world of Los Angeles doesn't seem, to me, that
different from today. It's populated by missing persons, runaways, gigolos,
snoops, remote-control punks, gold diggers, and ``the kind of lawyers you hope
the other fellow has''. Chandler wrote about abortionists, Dr Feelgoods, gurus,
and porn merchants before other writers - or most people including the police -
knew they existed. Marlowe really did walk ``mean streets''.
Chandler's insight provided a university of writing. But for all the telling
novels it is in his letters - his thoughts on paper - in these landmark
editions that you find the man who hated critics, despised Hollywood, suspected
Jews, adored his wife, and loved his cat.
He writes on everything.
On Hemingway: ``Hemingway, with his eternal sleeping bag, got to be pretty damn
tiresome but at least Hemingway sees it all, not just the flies in the garbage
can.''
Scott Fitzgerald: ``Nothing but the best will do for him. I think he just
missed being a great writer and the reason is pretty obvious. If the poor guy
was already an alcoholic in his college days, it's a marvel that he did as well
as he did.''
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle: ``Found a two-bit edition of Hound of the Baskervilles.
God, what tripe. It looks to me as if Lincoln was wrong. You can fool all of
the people all of the time.''
On the English: ``There is a touch of aggressiveness about the working classes
and the non-public school types which I think is something new and which I
personally do not find all that unpleasant. The real public school types, or
many of them, with their bird-like chirpings, are becoming a little
ridiculous.''
On women: ``I find it impossible to respect a woman who lives with a man. She
can sleep with him all she blame pleases and with whomever else she pleases and
in whatever place she pleases but the tawdry imitation of domesticity gets me
down.''
On himself: ``I am standoffish with strangers, a form of shyness which whisky
cured when I was still able to take it in the requisite quantities. I am
terribly blunt, having been raised in that English tradition which permits a
gentleman to be almost infinitely rude if he keeps his voice down.''
They call it Chandleresque. Or Chandler-style. That's when other people do it.
But no-one plugged the famous or the Establishment with such lethal .38
epigrams as the real Raymond Chandler who now has been officially recognised as
a literary giant.
She gave me a smile I could feel in my hip pocket.

``WHY don't we pull the whole wretched thing down and start again?'' stormed Mr
Tony Banks (Newham North-West - Lab.). Had Tony been a Byzantine MP, say for
Trebizond West, in the eighth century, he would have been a big man in the
Iconoclastic Party.
He was referring to the Mother of Parliaments, which he cheekily though not
wholly erroneously described as ``a cross between a gentlemen's club and a
public school''.
Down with it even unto the ground, he foamed, like a latter day Cato. Mr Tony
Newton, Leader of the House, defended the work of Sir Charles Barry and
Augustus Pugin as a fine building - which indeed it is - which deserved to stay
put.
It is hardly the fault of these eminent Victorians and the architects who
restored the bombed-out Commons in their image if it is sometimes the scene of
``banal questions and pathetic answers,'' as Mr Banks contemptuously dismissed
events up until his eruption.
A compliment from Transport Minister Steven Norris on his attire - a natty
black suit and shirt which, in the Sketch's opinion, made him look like a small
but deadly Mafia hitman - had failed to sweeten his jaundiced view.
One facility which Sir Charles and Augustus omitted to provide for their
stately creation was toilets for the disabled. There were, of course, plenty of
disabled people around in the nineteenth century, but they were not then in the
habit of mounting mass lobbies of parliament.
The disabled are treated better these days and, if they come to lobby to be
treated even better, access to a cup of tea and a lavatory is the least they
should expect. So argued several Labour MPs anyway.
Mr Alan Beith (Berwick - Lib. Dem.), whose good tempered and well-informed
replies to questions addressed to him as chairman of the House of Commons
Commission which runs the building, shows what we have lost through his party's
inability to form or even take part in an administration for half-a-century.
While the Palace looks magnificent there is less vacant space inside than one
might imagine, and it appeared that a cafeteria for visitors, disabled or
otherwise, in Westminster Hall only could be provided by flinging out the staff
who currently use it. Temporary disabled toilets too look likely to be almost
permanent for the foreseeable future.
Sir Peter Viggers (Gosport - Con.) said some demonstrators had ``unreasonable
expectations'' that they would be able to enter into a dialogue with their MP.
It was unreasonable because the Commons, though large, does not have the space
for several thousand demonstrators to enter into Socratic discussions with
their elected representatives.
Mr Newton and his equally pleasant Shadow, Mrs Ann Taylor, continued their
love-in which is slowly modernising Commons procedures so that it may well
enter the first half of the twenty-first century adequately equipped to deal
with the problems of the middle of the twentieth.
However, Sir Anthony Grant (Cambridgeshire South-West - Con.) suggested that
boxes might be left at the exits into which grateful visitors might put
voluntary ``donations'' which could go towards providing better facilities for
their successors.
Mr Beith turned this down succinctly. ``They feel they are paying for this
place out of their taxes and they are entitled to have a look round.''
Mr Harry Greenway (Ealing North - Con.) was concerned that the one opera hat
which a Member must wear seated if he or she wishes to raise a point of order
during a vote, was not enough. A second should be provided, he urged.
Although visitors to the public gallery have a fair chance of sampling the
ridiculous, the opera hat must come high on the scale of absurdities, but, in
fairness to the British constitution, one should say that an alternative is not
so easy to devise as might be thought. In this respect, the opera hat resembles
the House of Lords.
The Sketch suggests that Members should be allowed to raise points of order in
a hat of their choice. This would pose no problem for the Tory ladies, while
Labour's lurch to the right has been sartorial as well as political, so the
female comrades might produce fancy plumage too. As for Mr Banks, given his
rig-out yesterday, a natty black fedora would be just the job.

CRICKET
ENGLAND are heading off for Thursday's second Test having solved all but one of
their problems after their two matches against Orange Free State.
Graham Thorpe scored an undefeated century and Alec Stewart hit top form with
innings of 110 and 81. Dominic Cork shook off the rust while batting and
bowling impressively and Mark Ramprakash did enough to suggest England are
right to stand by him.
That just leaves Devon Malcolm, whose one hope now would seem to rest on the
pitch at The Wanderers. If it looks quick and full of life, he just might sneak
into Thursday's line-up ahead of spinner Richard Illingworth.
Meanwhile, there are no plans for extra security measures for England's
cricketers following yesterday's fatal shooting during a Cape Town boxing
match, where armed robbers killed a cashier.
England's cricketers are en route to Johannesburg - one of the world's most
dangerous cities - but the players have been accompanied by two or three armed
guards from the VIP Protection Unit since arriving in South Africa.
q GLOUCESTERSHIRE fast bowler Mike Smith, who hurt rib ligaments in England A's
first match, will return home later this week.
Warwickshire seamer Tim Munton, who arrived in Pakistan on Friday as cover,
will stay on for the remaining three weeks of the tour but will not play in
Thursday's second Test against Pakistan A in Rawalpindi, where Dean Headley and
Ed Giddins will form the new-ball attack.
The three-day match against a Patrons' XI petered out into a draw yesterday.
Scores:
Tour match. England A 298-6 dec (N V Knight 107, J C Pooley 100no) and 130-4
dec; Patron's XI 187-9 dec (Azwar Mahmood63 no; T A Munton 5-54) and 88-3. In
Lahore. Match drawn.

HAVING read John Hodgert's essay (November 25) and recalled our time spent at
Dalry High School and in the 1st Dalry Co BB (his older brother Lindsay once
skelped our ears on parade for cheek!) I am rather reluctant to take issue with
his mission to promote the so-called ``Scots'' language.
Yet it has to be said that there is no chance of unanimity of pronunciation in
our country given the wide range of dialects currently in use.
The best example is demonstrated by the 2-nil football score which is ``twae
up'' (as in ``way'') in the New Cumnock area, ``twa up'' (as in ``wall'') in
the Ayr area, and ``two up'' (as in ``loo'') in the Kilbirnie area.
If we can't achieve unanimity in one county, what chance does Scotland have?

SNOOKER
A DISGUSTED Dennis Taylor found himself back in the commentary box sooner than
he had hoped after a crushing 9-1 third-round defeat by Ken Doherty at the
Royal Liver Assurance UK Championship in Preston last night.
``If I had too many matches like that I'd pack it all in,'' said the 1985 world
champion. ``At times it was embarrassing.''
Doherty now prepares for a repeat tomorrow of last year's UK final against
champion        Stephen Hendry.
The Dubliner set the tone with an excellent run of 94 to take the first frame.
Breaks of 41, 74, 37, 113, and 59 took Doherty 7-0 in front, and in four frames
Taylor managed just six points. He broke his duck in the final frame of the
afternoon but last night Doherty sealed his quarter-final place in just 41
minutes.
Ronnie O'Sullivan also built up a 7-1 first-session lead will take it into this
afternoon's session against struggling Scot Chris Small.
O'Sullivan has struggled in the first few months of the          season, with a
couple of first-round exits. But the 19-year-old from Essex has grown in
confidence at Preston.
World No.3 O'Sullivan made the perfect start, racing into a       5-0 lead with
breaks of 61, 63, and 94. Edinburgh's Small, world-ranked No.62, appeared ill
at ease on a rare outing before the television cameras.
He eventually got on the scoreboard with a run of 61 to clinch the sixth frame.
But O'Sullivan resumed normal service in the final two frames, with breaks of
55 and 80.
Devon left-hander Andy Hicks, a semi-finalist in this year's world
championship, staged a great comeback to establish a 5-3 overnight lead against
Thailand's James Wattana. World No.17 Hicks trailed 2-0 and 3-1 but, helped by
a break of 100, he responded to the challenge to take four frames in a row with
further runs of 65 and 97.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke last night described German moves to fine EU member
states which break the rules for a single currency as ``rather draconian''.
However, he denied that the Germans - pivotal players in the run-up to monetary
union by the end of the century - would be interfering with Britain's national
sovereignty.
Pro-European Mr Clarke was speaking to reporters in Brussels after meeting
other EU finance ministers to discuss technical moves towards the proposed
single currency.
They will report their findings - and possibly a name for the new coinage - to
the EU's summit next month in Madrid.
The talks were dominated by a suggestion from Germany's finance minister Theo
Waigel that there should be a so-called stability pact among EU states opting
to join monetary union - leading to a single currency - by 1999.
Those in the pact would enforce budgetary discipline, including the possible
use of fines for member states who did not obey the rules.
Mr Clarke said: ``I don't believe these are a great threat to national
sovereignty.''
Britain still would have freedom to take its own decisions in all necessary
areas such as taxation policy.
He added that Britain had little to fear from the idea of such a pact because
the United Kingdom agreed with the Germans that there had to be lasting
stability in EU finances before and after the single currency.
``These ideas don't pose a great difficulty for the Government,'' he said.
``The policy of the British Government is to work towards having a balance in
the medium term. Our policy towards the single market has been to achieve
stable working conditions.''
He described Mr Waigel's call - which has caused alarm in some EU states
struggling to meet the economic conditions demanded by Maastricht for the
single currency - as ``simply the beginning of a discussion about economic and
monetary union.''
Only Belgium, Austria, Holland and France have so far indicated that they can
support the Waigel proposal, which would effectively force member states to
apply German standards of rigour to their economies.
Although Britain supports budgetary discipline, Mr Clarke made it clear there

``Theo Waigel has always been as clear as I have that the setting of tax is for
national governments, the setting of public expenditures is for national
governments. The kind of Budget I have tomorrow will always continue,'' he said.
``In so far as he is pressing for European governments all to concentrate on
keeping their deficits down and keeping their countries out of debt that I
agree with, but the details require an awful lot of talking about,'' he added.

<HEADLINE>New school of excellence aims to ward off council cutbacks</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND'S biggest university and its associated teacher training college are
to establish a centre of excellence in education which aims to safeguard
projects threatened by local government reform.
The Glasgow School of Education will bring together expertise in Glasgow
University and St Andrew's College to provide lecturers, teachers, education
managers, and researchers with support and greater opportunities for career
development.
The school will comprise the college, Scotland's Roman Catholic
teacher-training institution, and two of the university's departments.
The university has been concerned about local government reform jeopardising
its ability to combat social exclusion. One of its initiatives, for instance,
is the innovative summer school. This gives potential students from
disadvantaged backgrounds who do not have conventional qualifications for
university entrance the opportunity to experience higher education and secure a
place on a course.
It is one of several projects funded by Strathclyde region but the authority's
demise could result in Glasgow experiencing a shortfall of about #30m in the
budget the new city council believes it needs for education.
The cost of maintaining projects such as the summer school and others which
expand educational opportunities could amount to about #350,000 a year.
University and college officials hope that inter-institutional developments
such as the new school will guarantee their future. A Scottish Higher Education
Funding Council review has placed a further question mark over Government
financial support for continued education.
The school will seek to exploit opportunities for in-service teacher training.
The smaller unitary councils are likely to be unable to offer the service.
In recognition of the increasingly competitive education marketplace, the
school will seek to provide cost-effective courses designed to meet the needs
of the new authorities and their schools.
It also plans to build on the research bases in both institutions, at a time
when the emphasis on research is growing.
Glasgow University vice-Principal Professor Andrew Skinner said the school
would focus on areas such as leadership and management training for teachers
and educationalists; in-service staff development; special educational needs -
one of the college's strengths; parental involvement in education; postgraduate
courses; work-based learning; community education and supporting a social
strategy; and research.
Professor Bart McGettrick, Principal of St Andrew's College, said the centre
would mean ``better support for educational professionals such as teachers and
lecturers''. Most importantly of all, he said, that meant ``the provision of
more effective education for students and pupils in the classroom''.

IN his front-page exclusive (November 25) Robbie Dinwoodie reveals that the
Nationalists, after 61 years of deliberation, are finally to tell us what their
separatist parliament would consist of. At last we are to know its membership,
voting method, powers, and relationship with England, Europe, and the world.
How extraordinary that it has taken all this time to come up with plans for a
parliament. It is significant to note that over the same timescale the SNP has
the poorest electoral record of all Scotland's political parties.
The hard fact is the Scots do not support the SNP in anything like the numbers
that would make them a viable choice at the next election. Whatever they tell
us on St Andrew's Day has little relevance to the real debate between the
Tories and Labour as only one of these two parties will win the General
Election.
Robbie Dinwoodie says the SNP dipped in The Herald poll last month after a
summer of mounting success. What mounting success? The success or otherwise of
political parties is measured by election results.
The most recent elections were the unitary authority elections last April which
saw another dismal performance from the SNP. In my own constituency they were
reduced to two seats out of 15 - their worst result in 28 years,
The SNP are entitled to their dreams and fantasies. That is what they shall
remain. All available evidence drawn from real elections and opinion polls,
including The Herald's polls, points to a Labour victory.
The Scottish Diaspora in England and elsewhere should be encouraged to mak
siccar by voting Labour for a Scottish Parliament. The SNP should tell us if
they are prepared to recommend that action to exiled Scots. It would be more
useful and practical than their spoiling exercise scheduled for Thursday
Norman Hogg MP,
House of Commons.

IT could be argued that never before in the field of human politics has so much
been read by so many into the views of so few. The Scotland on Sunday survey,
published on November 26, found 15 company bosses who said they would quit
Scotland in the event of a Scottish parliament being established. This out of a
total of 300 polled.
The result of the recent survey of views by the Scottish Chambers of Commerce,
which has been so widely picked over by all the political parties, was in fact
the views of only the 650 members who bothered to respond.
A response rate of only 19.1% seems to indicate more a lack of interest in the
great debate than any great enthusiasm for either independence or the status
quo. And who can blame them? Running a small company or indeed any company in
the present economic climate leaves little time for political considerations.
Certainly if business people felt really threatened by any of the proposals
then more would undoubtedly have taken the time to respond. This clearly did
not happen.
It would have been interesting if the present chambers' survey had put the same
question as was posed in the chambers' August 1991 survey. This asked ``Do you
support the establishment of a Scottish parliament with defined economic powers
including the ability to adjust income tax by up to 3p in the pound?''
This option, which is what the Scottish Constitutional Convention are
proposing, received 28% support from the 400 business respondents. (Perhaps
surprisingly this 1991 survey also had a 28% positive response to the question
``Would you support the case for a Scottish parliament with independent
representations in Europe?'')
It is not clear what those answering the present questionnaire read into the
term ``devolution with tax-changing powers'' - one suspects most assumed that
this referred to powers to vary company as well as personal taxation.
Future surveys by the chambers of commerce will probably be more specific and
it is likely that once it is clear that the devolution option only related to
power to vary income tax by 3p in the pound and not corporation tax, then the
percentage support for the convention's devolution proposals will rise
dramatically.
It is a shame that the same small number (15) of ``leading Scottish
businessmen'' who rallied to the defence of the (Conservative) Union in 1992,
are again coming out of the woodwork to threaten to quit Scotland if there is
any change to the status quo (or at least any change not sanctioned by
Conservative Central Office).
Against the possible loss of these 15 company head offices must be offset the
much larger number of companies who will decide to move into Scotland to take
advantage of the benefits which the convention's parliament will help create.
For a Scottish parliament with the powers proposed would be good for business
in Scotland.
l Business people will enjoy better and closer links with politicians. The open
structure of government which will be established will ensure that business
views will be heard and will be listened to. The policies which emerge will be
made in Scotland for the benefit of Scotland.
l Links with Brussels will be greatly strengthened. Hamish Morrison of the
Scottish Council Development and Industry has described a Scottish parliament
as a ``Whitehall bypass''.
l The psychological boost which the formation of a Scottish parliament will
give to the Scots will result in a real boost to the Scottish economy. People
of ability who have been put off from becoming involved in politics by the
sterility of the present set-up will stand for election. With proportional
representation no one party can dominate the new parliament.
l Company taxation will remain with Westminster so business has no need to fear
it could be disadvantaged in any way by the new set up. Indeed a Scottish
parliament would seek wherever possible to use its powers to encourage existing
businesses and to encourage inward investment. Training policies, for example,
will be established and streamlined to suit the needs of the Scottish economy.
In short, business in Scotland has nothing to fear and much to gain from a
Scottish parliament as proposed by the Constitutional Convention. Scottish
business does not need Westminster to protect it from the Scottish people.

QUALIFYING SCHOOL
ALL four Scots left in today's final round of the PGA European Tour Qualifying
School in Spain remain in contention for one of 40 coveted cards.
Only Stephen Gallacher can possibly contemplate a relaxing afternoon at San
Roque on the Costa del Sol while the others sit perilously close to the cut-off
mark of five-over-par.
The 21-year-old from Bathgate is unlikely to sit back following a disappointing
day yesterday when he slipped to a one-over-par 73 as a stiff breeze again blew
competitors off course on the Tony Jacklin-designed venue. ``That was
horrendous,'' was the Walker Cup man's stark assessment of his fifth round
across the testing 7044-yard course.
Raymond Russell atoned well for opening slips, the Longniddry lad covering the
final 10 holes in four under par to complete a fine 71. Scott Henderson (King's
Links) sits one shot behind him on a four-over-par score of 362.
Having lost out on winning his card at the fourth sudden-death play-off hole at
Montpellier last season, William Guy (Buchanan Castle) closed poorly for a
one-over-par 73 and sits on six over par.
South African Fredrick Buhrmann shot a 73 and leads by two strokes from
Englishmen Steve Webster - the winner of the amateur medal at this year's Open
Championship - and Andrew Collison. Leading scores:
350 - H Burhmann (S Africa) 67, 73, 69, 68, 73. 352 - A Collison (England) 69,
70, 71, 73, 69; S Webster (England) 74, 65, 71, 74, 68. 353 - M Wills (Wales)
71, 68, 70, 72, 72. 354 - S Gallacher (Bathgate) 72, 72, 68, 69, 73; T Gogele
(Germany) 67, 76, 68, 71, 72. 356 - P Sjoland (Sweden) 69, 76, 68, 74. 357 - R
Coles (England) 69, 72, 69, 74, 73; A Lebouc (France) 71, 68, 71, 74, 73; D
Edlund (Sweden) 79, 70, 72, 67, 69. 358 - S Pullan (England) 70, 70, 69, 74,
75; J Pinero (Spain) 73, 69, 68, 74, 74.
Other scores included: 361 - R Russell (Longniddry) 70, 73, 71, 76, 71. 362 - S
Henderson (King's Links) 70, 76, 68, 75, 72. 364 - W Guy (Buchanan Castle) 73,
74, 72, 72, 73.

THE BBC is to be told to listen to its audience and make clearer its
obligations to licence-fee payers, the Government announced yesterday.
A ``statement of pledges'' outlining what audiences can expect is one of the
main demands of the draft new BBC charter and agreement.
Governors are to be given tighter and ``explicit'' control of the running of
the corporation, and it has been told that its cherished editorial independence
must be matched by editorial responsibility.
The draft of the new 10-year charter laid to rest rumours that the Government
planned to break up the BBC when its current charter expires at the end of next
year. But National Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley, announcing the draft,
also disclosed a decision to privatise the BBC's transmission services.
The Department of National Heritage said the plan would provide ``a flexible
framework'' building on the public service tradition while allowing the BBC to
meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.
Corporation chairman Marmaduke Hussey welcomed the draft as a ``vote of
confidence in the BBC'', and said it justified the sometimes painful policies
pursued by top managers under Michael Checkland and John Birt.
Shadow Heritage Secretary Jack Cunningham said he welcomed the new charter's
explicit statement of the BBC's public service objectives.
But he questioned the transmission privatisation, which could result ``in
another unaccountable private monopoly''.
Mrs Bottomley said: ``The BBC is a national jewel. The BBC is internationally
recognised as the leading broadcaster in the world.
``The BBC's editorial independence is enshrined within the new agreement.
Editorial independence requires editorial responsibility. The BBC is recognised
as the cornerstone of British broadcasting. Often, where it leads others
follow. This places a responsibility on the BBC to ensure that standards are
maintained in a multi-media future.''
The charter has to be approved by Parliament.

SNP LEADER Alex Salmond was challenged yesterday by a Labour MP to back Labour
in England at the next General Election.
Cumbernauld and Kilsyth MP Norman Hogg has written to Mr Salmond demanding to
know if he will recommend that Scots living in England vote Labour for a
Scottish parliament.
Mr Hogg said: ``Salmond has to come clean. He wants independence but we all
know he has nothing like the votes needed to win a majority of Scottish
constituencies.
``Will he tell exiled Scots to vote Labour for a Scottish parliament? If
Salmond refuses to do this, he will confirm what a lot of us think - he wants
another Tory government.
``He hopes to benefit from the aftermath of a Labour defeat, but more important
he knows that a strong Scottish parliament screws his party's long-term
prospects.''
LESSONS from Scotland on how young people are dealt with by the legal system
are to be studied by Labour nationally. Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw said:
``Over the coming months, I shall be considering the working of the Scottish
children's hearings, as well as the experiences of other countries in Europe,
to see what lessons they hold for those dealing with offending by children and
young people.''
MAJOR changes in the blood service in England, saving #10m and costing 300
jobs, were announced yesterday by Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell. He told the
Commons that every hospital would continue to have its own blood bank and two
new centres would allow emergency supplies to be delivered in just two hours. A
new computer system would allow stocks to be managed on a national basis.
Administrative work now carried out at 13 centres would be concentrated on
three - in Leeds, Bristol and London. Shadow Health Secretary Harriet Harman
condemned the scrapping of processing and testing work at certain centres as a
``false economy.''
THE Earl of Gowrie has advised parents to wash their children's hair in whisky
if they have head lice. However, crossbencher Lady Saltoun of Abernethy
wondered in the Lords if surgical spirit would also do the trick. However,
junior health Minister Baroness Cumberledge replied: ``I think these are a lot
of lousy suggestions!''

TRANSPORT Secretary Sir George Young yesterday defended guarantees given to
rail passengers on fares, as he responded after protests over 3.5% increases
scheduled for the new year. He told MPs: ``The consumer has two guarantees that
he has never had before: key fares will not rise more than real terms over the
next three years, and over a period of seven years, the services spelt out in
Passenger Services Requirements will not be withdrawn.

MAY I respond to John Bisland's letter on the misuse England instead of Britain
(November 24)?
The answer to his question is: No he is most certainly not alone in harbouring
resentment; but the sad news is that it will never be any different while the
London-based media mandarins continue to pander to English nationalism by going
along with these fallacies.
The morning following the Panorama broadcast by the Princess of Wales, I
purposely tuned my radio into English-based stations to find her often referred
to as the future Queen of England, and the Prince of Wales being referred to as
a future King of England.
Those stations who invited phone calls from listeners provided a real insight
into the English disdain for the Act of Union - the British monarchy was
non-existent.
If, after nearly 400 years since the Union of the Crowns, so many English
people cannot see themselves to be British how will they ever come round to
being European?
John Inglis,

Renfrew.
JOHN Bisland is not alone in his feelings (November 24).
Have you noticed that for a long time new contestants on most TV competitions
have been introduced as ``A from Birmingham, B from Liverpool, C from
Portsmouth, D from Bath, and E from Scotland''?
Perhaps they really do think that Scotland is a town in the north of England.

NEIL KINNOCK was at the centre of controversy last night after he exposed a
deep rift in the European Commission over the proposed single currency and EU
enlargement.
Mr Kinnock broke with the commission's tradition of collective responsibility
when he said monetary union in 1999, as scheduled, was ``unrealistic''.
He also said that granting EU membership to ex-communist states in eastern
Europe would take longer and cost more than is officially estimated.
Commissioners in Brussels have spent months denying they have serious doubts
about these issues, which are the two biggest political challenges facing the
EU as it prepares to renegotiate the Maastricht treaty next year to cope with
enlargement and the expanding single market.
Mr Kinnock, who became transport commissioner after relinquishing the Labour
Party leadership in the wake of the last General Election, was talking to a
closed business seminar in Bracknell, Berkshire, on Friday.
His speech, described by the commission as ``private'' for a group of 200
businessmen, was not distributed routinely, but his comments were reported by a
French news agency. Copies of the speech - in which Mr Kinnock said he was
speaking as a commissioner but not as the commission - were suddenly
unavailable from his press service.
Mr Kinnock later discussed his remarks with commission president Jacques Santer
amid denials that he had been carpeted. ``Mr Kinnock was quite happy to explain
to Mr Santer what happened. It was not a speech for public consumption,'' his
spokeswoman said.
An indication of the split in the commission came earlier yesterday when EU
finance commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy said in Paris there was no
question of delaying the introduction of a single currency beyond 1999.
``We would have to renegotiate a new Maastricht treaty,'' he said.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, leaving Brussels to put finishing touches to today's
Budget, described Mr Kinnock's comments on the single currency as ``somewhat
sweeping''. Mr Clarke, a Cabinet pro-European, said the timetable for the
single currency was ``still too soon to call''.
In his speech to a forum, sponsored by Siemens, Mr Kinnock said Britain had the
choice of being part of economic and monetary union (Emu) or being dominated by
it.
``Geographical, financial and trading realities make that obvious to everyone
who isn't foaming at the mouth over `losing the Queen's head' or `conceding
monetary power','' he said.
Mr Kinnock added: ``Even when that is understood, however, the prospect of
monetary union (not in 1999 by the way - that is still unrealistic in my view
just as 1997 has been) should not, of course, be approached fatalistically.''
He said there should be a ``real debate'' on Emu which he described as
inevitable and desirable.
Mr Kinnock is believed to be in a minority in the commission on the chances of
some EU member states joining in monetary union by 1999. However, he is thought
to be in a majority who doubt privately that the EU can be expanded to 25 or 30
members in the early years of next century, as supporters of fast enlargement
claim.
He reminded his audience that applicant states had to show they could meet all
economic and political conditions required by the EU before they joined. There
was ``continual repetition of promises'' of membership and continuing dialogue
on the issue.
``Frankly, I think that this approach must be reconsidered,'' Mr Kinnock said.
``Continually holding out the prospect of enlargement whilst not doing enough
to make it really feasible produces the worse of both worlds.
``I believe that we should say honestly to the eastern and central European
countries that the prospect of membership is very distant and then tell them
that we would like to implement a different approach - one that has rather less
rhetoric and rather more substance.''

A NEW machine offering the latest laser treatment for the biggest preventable
cause of blindness was launched in Edinburgh yesterday.
The #70,000 laser can operate on several wavelengths and treat a wider variety
of diabetic retinopathy conditions than existing models. Edinburgh Royal
Infirmary's eye pavilion is the first NHS centre in Britain to buy one.
Funding for the US-built machine came from the infirmary's diabetic treatment
trust.
About 140,000 people in Scotland have diabetes and as many again may have the
disease but do not show symptoms. Of those diagnosed, 80% are liable to develop
eye disease from their diabetes within 20 years.
Associate specialist in ophthalmology Dr Kenneth Swa said it was essential that
diabetics followed their treatment and underwent regular eye checks.
``There is no point in having the best laser if the right patients are not
coming to this department. It is essential that diabetics have their eyes
examined properly and be referred to us. Screening is absolutely critical,'' he
said.
Laser treatment is the only way of preventing blindness through diabetic
retinopathy and, if used early enough, can be effective in 90% of cases. It
works by removing blood vessels which form on the retina.
Mother-of-two Mrs Muriel Darling, of Duddingston Grove, Edinburgh, a diabetic
for 31 years, is one of the first to benefit from the new machine. A routine
eye test picked up her condition in 1991 and she is now undergoing a course of
laser treatment on her right eye.
``Those people with diabetes who don't come for checks may later find there is
something wrong but by then it's too late. I can see perfectly but there are
some little growths and blood vessels which need to be treated.
``There is a dull ache when undergoing the treatment but I think it's worth
putting up with to be able to see for the rest of my life.''

MORE than 5000 postal workers in Scotland were back at work yesterday to help
move a backlog of 12 million items which piled up during their week-long
unofficial industrial action.
The Royal Mail reported that, apart from a ``blip'' in Dundee and Perth caused
by a communication problem, work on the backlog, which will take at least a
week to clear, was going very well.
A settlement in the dispute, which began in a delivery office in Portobello,
Edinburgh, over duty changes and spread to other parts of Scotland, was reached
at the weekend.
A 14-point peace plan, including the promise of a review of delivery services,
was accepted by workers at meetings on Sunday in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Talks
between the two sides are set to continue until mid-January.
Meanwhile, the Communication Workers' Union has agreed to suspend plans to
ballot members on taking official action.
More than 200 workers on Tayside yesterday voted unanimously to go back to work
at meetings in Dundee and Perth which approved the same deal put to workers on
Sunday.
They had stayed on strike until union leaders in the area could organise a vote
on the package.
Mr Joe Malone, CWU Tayside branch secretary, said there had been some confusion
over whether workers should return to work after the voting in Edinburgh and
Glasgow.
``The package was not officially accepted until votes had been taken in Dundee
and Perth.''
The Royal Mail said it was disappointed and puzzled that it had taken the
Tayside staff an extra day to return.
Workers at Hamilton who had taken official action last week also voted
overwhelmingly yesterday to return to work.
However, after a noisy two-hour meeting, Mr John Keggie, CWU divisional officer
for Scotland and Northern Ireland, spoke of staff anger and frustration over
the way the Hamilton office had been treated.
He said workers had spent 16 weeks enduring additional supervision and close
monitoring as management cut back on second deliveries of post.
He said the feeling was so strong that if the underlying matters were not
solved between now and December 23 there could be further developments.

MYRA McKinlay, the former Curtis Cup player from Scotland, will be making her
second attempt to earn her card for the American Express Tour in the 72-hole
qualifying school tournament which begins over the South course at La Manga
Club in Spain today, writes Bill Johnson.
McKinlay failed on her first attempt over the same course last March and played
in only nine tournaments this year. Her position of No.100 on the final merit
table enforced a return to Spain.
It has been a disappointing season for the Scot, who made an encouraging debut
as a professional when she finished eighth in the English Open at Tytherington
last year before making the cut in both the Dutch and Spanish Opens.
Only the top 40 and ties in the field of 92 will earn their cards for next
season and McKinlay, Morag Wright, Karin Ross, Lindsey Irvine, and Tracey Craik
are the five Scots in the field.
Karrie Webb, the British Open champion from Australia, came through the first
qualifying school in March and went on to win this year's Rookie of the Year
award.
This performance has encouraged six other Australians to play this week.
Much will be expected from Kristel Mourgue d'Algue from France, who reached the
British amateur championship final this year, 12 months after her mother
Cecilia also lost in the final. Earlier this year Mourgue d'Algue shared ninth
place in the Evian Masters.
With Annika Sorenstam dominating women's professional golf this year, it is no
surprise to find 16 Swedes in Spain this week.

TWO private schools in Ayrshire are to join forces.
Wellington School in Ayr and Drumley House in Mossblown will merge next year to
form the only independent co-educational school in Ayrshire with a roll of
between 400 and 500 pupils.
Wellington School was established in 1836 and is in only its second year
catering for both girls and boys. Drumley House began the preparatory education
of boys and girls aged between three and 13 in 1960, and now has a roll of 100.
Mr Bill Mowat, chairman of Wellington's board of governors, said: ``Such a
decision is not reached lightly, but the two school boards are unanimous that
the provision of a single, strong and vibrant independent school provides the
most sensible and secure future for private-sector education in Ayrshire.''
It is envisaged that the current Drumley House campus will eventually close and
the merged school will operate from two centres in Ayr.
Drumley House headteacher Charles Robinson said of the merger: ``It will be of
enormous benefit to both current and future pupils and we are looking forward
to establishing and maintaining the highest of educational standards in the new
school.''
The new school will be known as Wellington School incorporating Drumley House
School.

``WELL, who would have thought it?'' Besides famous last words there are famous
first words, and these are the words spoken five years ago tomorrow by John
Major when he presided over his first Cabinet meeting as Prime Minister. Or,
perhaps he said - ``Well, who would have thought it!'' Either way, they were
far more memorable than anything else uttered in the succeeding five years.
The trouble with anniversaries, as Lady Thatcher found out to her cost, is that
they remind people how long the celebrant has been around, in politics, as in
life, not necessarily a good thing.
The Major years began after I had stopped reporting Parliament, so my
experience of him as close to first hand as you ever get to Prime Ministers,
even as a lobby correspondent, is slight. I do remember a distinctly
ill-at-ease Foreign Secretary at the Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Heads of
Government meeting being condescended to by the might of the diplomatic
correspondents, not the least of his worries, because She Who Must Be Obeyed
stabbed him in the back over a deal he had cobbled up on South African
sanctions.
Then there was a remarkably pally Prime Minister at the Harare CHOGM ruffling
the hair of the man from Today, which had just published a fawning interview.
If ever there was proof that he was not the man she thought he was that was it.
I suspect it was not out of character and the man-of-the-people image is real.
When I interviewed him, during his time as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, he
helped me into my coat as I left, and then sent a thank-you note saying I had
put it far better than he had done. It suggests he really is a nice man,
although I have two thank-you telemessages from Barbara Cartland, hung in the
obvious place. But they are patently the work of her secretary. The Major note
was hand-written.
What, I wonder, will his last words be? And when will we hear them? Must we
wait another five years? As we know a weak is a long time in politics. Or will
today's Budget do the trick? We live in interesting times. It will also be
interesting times when MPs reveal their remuneration for outside jobs to find
what the Tory who advised the BBC on The Final Cut got for selling duff
information.
The last instalment of the Not Written By Michael Dobbs political trilogy was
utter nonsense in its portrayal of parliamentary procedure and the ease of
access to Prime Ministers it implied. Some of the errors were so glaring that
even the most occasional watcher of the Commons proceedings on the telly could
not have failed to spot them. Did they matter? Some were clearly to allow
eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation between Ian Richardson and Paul Freeman, and
simply dramatic licence. But to suggest that an MP could cross the floor, which
means quitting his party and resigning the Whip, but still contest the
leadership was going too far.
Changing the subject completely, but variety is the spice of life. One of the
brighter wheezes the makers of Goldeneye, the new James Bond film, had was to
make ``M'' a woman. One can just imagine the self-satisfied chortles at the
script conference when they dreamt that one up.
It was a means of bringing this dated saga into the nineties, the real-life
``M'' being until very recently Mrs Stella Rimmington, quite apart from the
fact that Bernard Lee, who stamped his personality on the role, was no longer
available, having gone to the great central casting in the sky.
I reckon while they were at it they should have turned Moneypenny into a man,
since there are loads of male PAs around these days, as it would have given the
relationship with Bond a whole new meaning. But maybe that would be going too
far, except that while they have found in Dame Judi Dench a suitably acerbic
``M'' the replacement for the divine Lois Maxwell is pure plastic. Nothing
dates like a wheeze. On the day the film premiered it was announced that Mrs
Rimmington is to retire and be replaced by a man. Let us hope Dame Judi has a
nice watertight run-of-the-series contract, or she could lose what must be a
nice little earner, especially should she, which Heaven forfend, be reduced to
opening supermarkets and gas stations.
Returning to anniversaries - logical thought was never one of my strengths - in
one of his fifth-anniversary interviews Mr Major revealed that his political
views had been shaped by what he had seen as a boy in Brixton, ``the
paternalism of the nanny state writ small, with very well-meaning people
seeking to help, but not the help one really wanted''. Politics was largely
about tolerance, he said, not necessarily about imposing what you happen to
think right upon other people.
Admirable sentiments, but surely not on the day Virginia Bottomley announced
new guidelines for the BBC to protect viewers from having to watch sex and
violence on television and listen to bad language. This must mean they can
never show Shakespeare or recite the works of Burns on the box.
The thing about television is that the viewer is not a victim. The viewer is in
charge. The viewer can switch the set off and settle down with a good book
instead. After all, if a guest in your home behaved in a manner you considered
unacceptable, would you not ask them to leave? Or would you write to your MP
and say the Government must do something about it?

REIM Airport, Munich. Here it was that Chamberlain arrived when he visited
Hitler in 1938, returning with a piece of paper announcing peace in our time.
Here, too, it was that the ill-fated Manchester United team, Busby's Babes,
crashed in 1958.
The aircraft have moved on to bigger and longer runways, but the empty airport
buildings remain. Lego-sized, they are a child's idea of an airport. Now,
however, instead of reeling to the sound of jets, they throb to the sound of
techno.
Among the commercial pop arenas there is one space which is known across the
continent: Ultraschall, or Beyond sound in English. Here they play
technological music of an innovative persuasion. And here it was that DJs
Twitch and Brainstorm, residents at the Edinburgh club Pure, were recently to
be found, displaying their prodigious DJ'ing talents.
In clubbing terms, Pure is an institution. Over five years it has gained the
reputation of being Scotland's premier night of techno and trance. Yet Twitch
and Brainstorm are only now making their first international tour. All two
dates of it.
It's 4am and in Scotland most clubs would have been finished for an hour but
Ultraschall won't close until 10am. Brainstorm, resplendent in his
international DJ'ing haircut - shorn close and dyed with a leopard-skin print -
drops a brand-new tune: there hasn't been dancing here this manic for all of a
week.
Ultraschall is only one of several dance arenas at the airport. The week before
they had all been brought together for a massive rave, Tribal Gathering, for
which the tribes came from all corners of the North Bavarian plain. From across
the Alps, from Italy, France, Switzerland, and Austria. Fifteen thousand turned
up. More would have been there if the first blasts of winter had not sent the
temperature plummeting to minus seven and deposited six inches of snow across
the land.
You couldn't design a better rave venue than Reim if you tried. The departure
lounges and baggage reclamation halls make a warren of huge arenas. The
international departure lounge which once echoed with deals being made by
businessmen on their way to Berlin was turned into Planet Erotica, a
strictly-house zone where women in skin-tight rubber dresses or clad in nothing
but body paint danced with men in minimal leather bondage gear on the stage.
But the main sound was a truly Teutonic techno. Warlike and pulsing with a
relentless four-four beat, it filled the halls. Situated slightly apart from
the main halls, in the old kitchens of the airport, the Ultraschall offered
music plus much more. Every storeroom and vacant corner had been put to use.
Turn one corner and you found a cafe. Turn another and enter a pitch-dark room,
humming with the sound of the sea sucking on the beach. Plunge into an unmarked
corridor and you would end up in a tiny room filled with smoke, strobes, and
people cavorting to the sinuous sound known as acid.
Small wonder the club has earned itself such a reputation. As Twitch and
Brainstorm spun their records on the main dancefloor, Glasgow's DJ Mingo Go
played easy listening in the back room. Henry Mancini's Little Elephant Walk
mixed effortlessly into Esquivel and Jimmi Tenor.
``My mission with this club is really to keep the people ahead,'' says Peter
Wacha, one of the four-strong team who run Ultraschall. ``I don't like to use
`techno' any more. So now we do electronic listening and dance music.''
Wacha's first memories of music are of late-seventies punk: Throbbing Gristle,
the Pop Group and the Birthday Party. ``It really gave me a kick,'' he says.
``That is also the point of this club: I'm old now, 33, and there are a lot of
young people who are in the situation that I was. If you go out in Munich you
mostly get really shitty music, so I wanted to give them the same kick as I
got.''
Sadly, commercial interests with a bigger clout than Wacha's have their eyes on
Reim. The infrastructure is just too good to throw away on mere hedonism and
the buildings will be demolished next May to make way for an international
conference centre. But until then, if you want no peace in your night-time in
the form of innovative music from dance's cutting edge, you know where to go.
n Twitch and Brainstorm play at Pure at the Edinburgh Venue every Friday. A
double-pack of Pure classics is due out soon on T &amp; B Vinyl with a mix CD to
follow next year.

A STAFF nurse at Berwick Infirmary who rewrote medical records following the
death of an 11-month-old baby has been sacked.
The nurse, who has not been named, had been suspended last month. Yesterday,
she was dismissed following a disciplinary hearing conducted by Cheviot and
Wansbeck NHS Trust.
A spokesman for the trust said: ``The panel concluded the nurse had falsified
entries on the casualty card and also attempted to destroy original
documentation which, in their opinion, constituted gross professional
misconduct.''
Ryan Smith, of Dean Drive, Tweedmouth, Berwick, died in a doctor's surgery in
the town where he had been taken by his parents following a telephone call
between the nurse and the family doctor.
There was no-one at the infirmary to examine the baby after he became ill. He
had suffered from a heart defect from birth.
An inquiry team set up by the trust had already concluded that the nurse's
action in rewriting the records had no effect on the outcome.

THE only reindeer herd in Britain will be travelling to Northern Ireland for a
festive procession - if owners the Reindeer Company at Glenmore near Aviemore
can cut through the red tape.
Thirty reindeer were loaded on to three specially adapted lorries yesterday
heading for the ferry across the Irish Sea to Dungannon - but before embarking
they must get import licences and veterinary clearance.
Ms Janet Stewart, of the Reindeer Company, said: ``We are still very hopeful of
making the short ferry crossing with them. It will be the first time that
reindeer have been ever harnessed to Santa's sleigh in the Emerald Isle . . .
apart from on Christmas Eve.''
She added: ``We have bookings from one end of the country to the other . . .
They will be appearing in processions in places as far apart as Wales,
Liverpool, London, Dorset, and Thurso.''
Two reindeer pull Santa's sleigh followed by three others in parades to mark
the switching on of the Christmas lights in towns and cities across Britain.
The reindeer return to the Cairngorms in the new year.
The Reindeer Company is owned by Elizabeth and Alan Smith, who go out on the
road with them. Ms Stewart is left to tend the remainder of the herd of 120.
Reindeer were introduced to Scotland by Laplander Mikel Utsi in 1952 to be bred
for venison, but the company now derives its income from tourism, sales to
theme parks, and Santa's sleigh-rides.

BOWLS
THE showpiece of the indoor season gets under way in Coatbridge this afternoon,
with the Scottish Masters being fought out over two days, while the semi-finals
and finals of the CIS Insurance national singles championship wrap up the
bonanza on Thursday.
The opening match in the #4000 eight-player Masters is a repeat of last year's
final, holder John Price from Swansea taking on Graham Robertson.
Each is bidding to become the first man to win the title for a third time and
the winner will meet the survivor of the clash of the Commonwealth champions -
Richard Corsie and women's gold medallist Margaret Johnston.
Tonight brings together the two world indoor champions - Andy Thomson and
women's title-holder Joyce Lindores - and completing the action is the clash
between Scottish champion Paul Conlan and the man he succeeded, Bainfield's
Alex Marshall.

SURGEONS have sewn back a man's hand which had been cut off by thugs wielding a
Samurai sword.
Mr Leslie Harding, 37, was attacked on Sunday night by ``skinheads'' outside a
public house in Leeds.
Mr Harding, of Chapeltown, Leeds, is black and police are investigating whether
there was a racial motive.
He was attacked after he left the Travellers public house in Selby Road,
Halton, Leeds, to remonstrate with the gang, who were smashing windows with
bricks and baseball bats.
One of the gang sliced off his right hand with the sword before fleeing but a
doorman picked it up and packed it in ice. Mr Harding was taken to St James's
Hospital, where consultant plastic surgeon Simon Kay operated.
He said: ``He was remonstrating with somebody and saw a flash of steel and felt
his hand go numb. Looking down, he found it had vanished and was lying on the
ground.
``It was completely severed just at the level of the wrist.''
Mr Kay said it was unlikely he would get the full use of his hand back and it
will be around a week before it is known whether the operation has been a
success.
He added: ``The first hurdle is getting the hand to survive. It looks at the
moment as though it is going to be okay.''
One female customer at the public house said there had been trouble earlier but
those involved had left, returning around closing time.
She said: ``There was a lot of screaming and shouting outside and the gang of
lads was smashing the windows with baseball bats.  I was standing in the
doorway watching and I heard one of them say `I'm going to cut your hand off'.
``One of them had a big mach-ete and he just chopped it off.
``Some of the staff were crying their eyes out. It was gruesome.''
A police spokeswoman said Mr Harding, who is unemployed, was too ill to be
interviewed about the incident. His wife is at his bedside.
The spokeswoman added: ``A racist attack is one of several possibilities that
we're looking at. It's very early in the investigation and until we speak to
him we won't know any more about why it happened.''

JAMES Freeman, in his article (November 23) about the trial of Rosemary West
headlined ``Why she should have gone Scot free'', states, including her husband
Fred in this opinion, ``They would literally have walked away scot free out of
legal reach because of the Scottish requirement for corroboration and the basic
requirement of fairness''. That is, of course, if they had been tried in
Scotland.
The erroneous, possibly unintentional, implication here is that there is some
connection between ``scot-free'' and Scotland.
There is no such connection. ``Scot-free'' means ``without harm, loss or
penalty'' and comes from ``scot and lot'', which was a municipal tax that was
abolished by the Reform Act of 1832.

SCOTTISH Trades Union Congress general secretary Campbell Christie joined
pensioners' groups, local authority leaders and church representatives
yesterday at an eve-of-Budget protest at the door of the Scottish Office.
Mr Christie handed in the STUC's own Budget submission and a four-ft-long tax
demand addressed to Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Scottish Secretary Michael
Forsyth.
During his address to about 70 supporters, Mr Christie told of his fears about
today's Budget announcements.
Mr Christie said he was alarmed that the Goverment may be about to cut taxes
for what he described as short-term partisan electoral advantage.
He said: ``The people of Scotland should realise he has a choice of improving
public services, creating jobs, helping the least-well-off or trying to buy
votes for the Tory Party through tax cuts.
``When people digest details of his Budget, they should realise he had that
choice.''
Turning his attention to Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, Mr Christie added:
``He has warned that this will be the harshest public spending round in living
memory.
``We think that is both unacceptable and unnecessary.
``The Government should be investing for the long term, not cutting welfare
benefits, eroding vital public services and freezing capital spending to find
pre-election tax bribes.
``We want to demonstrate to the Government that there is public opposition to
cuts and support for an alternative, including an emergency jobs package, a
planned boost to public investment and a restoration of decent benefits to
all.''
Concern also was raised by pensioners' leaders who were worried that any cuts
in social services would affect them directly.
President of the Edinburgh branch of the Scottish OAP Association, Mr Tom
Mellors, said: ``We have the second lowest level of pensions in Europe at
#58.75 a week. It is lower than anywhere apart from Greece.
``Pensioners throughout Scotland are very concerned at what will be included in
the Budget and that possible cuts in public spending to help pay for tax cuts
will affect people like us.''
Vice-president of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, Mr Keith
Geddes, said Cosla officials would be meeting tonight to scrutinise the Budget
and work out its impact on services north of the border.
Councillor Geddes said the Chancellor should not offer more tax bribes and
invest more in jobs and public services.

TWO weeks in another town lie ahead for two Glasgow film makers under the First
Film Foundation's New Directions programme. The other town is Hollywood, the
film makers Patrick Harkins, who worked in the prop department on films like
Shallow Grave and Hear My Song, and Angus Lamont, producer of Muriel Gray's The
Snow Show and The Golden Cagoule.
They are among eight film makers picked to meet the moguls and show their
wares. They have all made short films which will be screened at Bafta, Los
Angeles. They will also visit New York where the films will be screened by
Columbia-Tristar and at Robert De Niro's Tribeca Centre. It is hoped that
during the two weeks they will be able to find the backing they need to embark
on a first feature.
First Film Foundation, a charity, was set up in 1987 to provide training,
guidance, and development support for young people wishing to make a career in
film or television, and the New Directions programme is sponsored by the film
camera company, Panavision.
Ivan Mactaggart, foundation director, said the eight represented the best new
talent in the country. ``There is not much for Americans to look forward to
between Thanksgiving and Christmas, but we are changing all that,'' he added.
Patrick Harkins scored a big hit at the Edinburgh Film Festival with Nightlife,
his witty and sinister film, starring Jane Horrocks, about strange goings on in
Kelvingrove Park, made for BBC Scotland. His The Last Ten Minutes, which
starred Robert Carlyle, went out as the supporting feature with Shallow Grave,
and he also made the award-winning short, Narance.
Angus Lamont's short film for the BFI, Joyride, was shown at Cannes this year,
and he has a thriller, Shotgun Wedding, in development with Jim Gillespie which
is said to be ``Speed plus''. His work is said to be entertainment driven, not
always the case with first feature film aspirants, and the pair have made a
trailer to help boost their chances.

AN AUSTRALIAN businessman plans to manufacture twin-engined amphibian planes in
Ross and Cromarty.
Mr Kenn Heeley, 46, has set up the Ross Aircraft Company to begin making his
seaplanes close to the Cromarty Firth, which has a long history of seaplane
operations since before the First World War.
``I must emphasise right away that I'm no John DeLorean,'' said Mr Heeley
yesterday, who is aware that his venture sounds almost too good to be true.
He is being supported by the Scottish Office, Highlands and Islands Enterprise,
and Ross and Cromarty Enterprise, who see the potential for perhaps hundreds of
jobs.
Mr Heeley said the vast bulk of the aircraft would go to North America and the
Pacific Rim countries, although the Highlands and Islands themselves would be
ideal for the specially adapted 10-seater seaplanes.
A fifth-scale model of the aircraft has already been tested in secret at
Kilbirnie Loch, near Glasgow, and it exceeded all expectations.
The plane is based on the Pilatus Britten Norman Islander but incorporates a
design development which enables it to take off and land on water.
Mr Heeley said he was particularly keen for the project to be based in Ross and
Cromarty: ``The downgrading of the oil industry in the area, although very sad,
has left a fantastic infrastructure and highly skilled people.
``There is a long history connected to seaplane training and maintenance during
both world wars, and I came to know the area very well as I used to take
classic motor-cycle tours of 10 to 20 bikes at a time up to Ross and Cromarty.''
Once production is firmly established, Mr Heeley would like to open Britain's
only seaplane museum as well as provide a parcel and passenger delivery service
throughout the Highlands and crew and pilot training.
Manufacture of the planes could be at different places. ``There is no reason
why the tail and fin sections, for example, could not be made on Skye, the
undercarriage in Ross, and then have final assembly in, say, Invergordon,'' he
said.
The highly profitable Islander aircraft, once fitted with the seaplane
adaptation, would be a much cheaper alternative to existing seaplanes, he added.
The Civil Aviation Authority has given its go-ahead to the development
programme and full production of 20 seaplanes could be achieved within five
years.
Mr Heeley's designer is Mr David Thurston, of Thurston Aeromarine Corporation,
Maine. Other experts who are backing him include his commercial director, Mr
John Colley, and Mr Derek Wilson, ex-Rover and British Aerospace, who is
production director.

<HEADLINE>Bridge toll report `a PR exercise'</HEADLINE>

A GOVERNMENT transport watchdog has told Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth
that some people living in Skye or Kyle should not have to pay any more than a
#1 to cross the Skye Bridge, although it believes the imposition of tolls on
the bridge is logical and reasonable.
Campaigners have dismissed the report as nothing more than a public-relations
exercise for the Scottish Office.
MP Charles Kennedy described it as timid in the extreme and said it provided
camouflage for those still trying to defend the tolls.
Mrs Kathleen MacRae, treasurer of the Skye Bridge Appeal Group, said: ``It
really is pathetic that they have come out with this at a time when the
momentum is growing for the complete abolition of the tolls and for the
introduction of a system of shadow tolls, whereby the Scottish Office would pay
for each vehicle crossing.
``Their suggested concession to local car drivers does nothing for the people
of the Western Isles or for the vehicles that provide us with our goods and
services. It is just PR for the Scottish Office.''
The watchdog body, the Railway Users' Consultative Committee for Scotland,
denied that its report was a public-relations exercise. Its chairman, Ms Helen
Millar, said: ``This has nothing to do with the Scottish Office and we have
nothing to do with the Scottish Office. We will be sending a copy of the report
to them but we have not consulted them in any way.''
The Caledonian MacBrayne Users' Consultative Committee - as the Railway Users'
Consultative Committee for Scotland calls itself when considering ferry matters
- held a public meeting in Kyle of Lochalsh last month and found a clear
perception among local people that the Skye Bridge had been foisted on them.
The committee accepts that the majority of people indicated they wanted a
toll-free bridge but a substantial minority had stated they would not object to
paying a reasonable toll.
The committee's broad conclusion was the tariff of tolls was fair but there
were two groups excepted from this.
``We believe that for the people whose main residence is on Skye and for a much
smaller group around Kyle (who have to cross for work or medical treatment), a
concessionary level of toll should be applied recognising their status as local
residents.''
The committee recommends a toll of #1 for these cases.
The report also argues that no impediment or excessive charges should be put in
the way of any credible operator wanting to run a ferry in competition to the
bridge.
A Scottish Office spokesman said last night that Ministers would read the
committee's conclusions and recommendations with interest.
q Traffic levels on the Skye bridge have exceeded expectations in the first
month of operation, according to operator, Skye Bridge Ltd. It says about
36,000 vehicles used the bridge in the first full month since it opened on
October 16.

<HEADLINE>SNP to counter tax cut with plan for low-paid</HEADLINE>

A CUT of 2p in the basic rate of income tax, as widely mooted at Westminster,
will be the subject of an immediate challenge by the SNP, which will move
instead its own Budget proposal for a new lower tax band of 15p.
SNP leader Alex Salmond claimed yesterday that his party's plan to bring in a
new rate for low-earners would cost exactly the same - #3bn - as cutting 2p
from the basic rate, and he used a poll carried out last weekend to demonstrate
that 86% of Scots would prefer to see a change which targeted help on the
less-well-off.
Party activists carried out more than 1100 interviews with Saturday-morning
shoppers in 13 towns and cities across Scotland, and claimed to have received
widespread support for tax cuts aimed at the poor (86%).
Mr Salmond said yesterday: ``Given this weight of Scottish opinion and the fact
that there is no difference in cost to the Exchequer, if the Chancellor
suggests cutting the standard rate by 2p, we will immediately move our
counter-proposal targeting tax cuts on the less-well-off.''
Labour joined the chorus demanding a Budget for jobs and investment, paid for
by a windfall tax on private utility profits.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said the Prime Minister's desire to
scrap capital gains tax and inheritance tax would cost #4.5bn and benefit the
privileged few.
``The average Scottish family has now seen 21 Tory tax rises since the last
election, and is now paying more than #800 a year extra in tax,'' he said.
``The Tories promised tax cuts year on year at the last election. They lied.''
The survey by SNP canvassers at the weekend found 86% in favour of targeting
tax cuts on the less well off; 93% in favour of cutting the National Insurance
burden on employers to encourage job creation; 90% in favour of abolishing
means testing for residential care for the elderly which often enforces the
sale of homes; 85% supporting a cut in the tax on whisky; and 94% backing the
return of the Skye Bridge to public hands and the cutting of tolls.
``There is massive support in Scotland for the kind of mainstream policies
which the SNP published in our budget earlier this month,'' Mr Salmond said.
``Every one of the measures backed by Scots in our suvey has in important place
in the SNP's four-year-economic strategy for an independent Scotland.''
He pointed out that the abolition of means-testing for those admitted to
residential health care would cost #500m in the UK - just half of the cost of
abolishing capital gains tax which would help the very wealthy.
The SNP said that the survey had produced interesting results in some parts of
the country. Eastwood, for example, returns Tory MP Allan Stewart, and yet of
127 people questioned there 119 wanted tax cuts to be aimed at the
less-well-off and 124 supported scrapping the seizure of homes of the elderly
taken into care.

<HEADLINE>Legal threat to film of `spy camera' clips</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A VIDEO compilation of ``spy camera'' clips - including a couple having sex in
a lift - was threatened with a legal ban yesterday amid claims that it had
included one police sequence without permission.
Carlton TV's lawyers demanded that Caught In The Act! should be withdrawn
immediately from high street stores or face an injunction, because it had
allegedly used material owned by its Inside Crime programme.
City of London Police said they were ``furious'' the clip from their traffic
cameras had found its way into the tape.
It came after MPs attacked the #10.99 video and called for legislation to halt
such videos.
A Carlton TV spokesman said: ``Our lawyer has sent a letter calling on the
producer Barrie Goulding to undertake to cease distribution of the video
immediately with our copyright material in it.
``Failing that, our lawyer has no hesitation in seeking an injunction to
restrain further distribution.''
The clip, showing a suspect car fleeing through a shop front, had been released
only to Inside Crime, a programme about surveillance cameras, he said.
A City of London police spokesman said: ``We are furious at the unauthorised
use of our material.
``We think the film raises the fear of crime, is salacious and invasive of
people's privacy.''
There was no immediate response from the video makers last night to the threat
of legal action.
Meanwhile, Strathclyde Chief Constable Leslie Sharp yesterday repeated a vow
made earlier this year never to release CCTV footage for public entertainment.
A police spokesman said last night: ``Under no account would the chief
constable release that sort of footage for public entertainment. We operate
under very, very strict guidelines.''

<HEADLINE>Grandfather, 92, stabbed to death Call for hospital inquiry after killing by ex-patient</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975159465</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN architect, who was convinced there was a Moonie conspiracy to kill him,
stabbed his grandfather to death with nail clippers.
Nigel Gatt, 38, believed James Gatt, 92, and several friends were plotting to
murder him, the High Court in Forfar heard yesterday.
Gatt, who was suffering from religious and persecutory delusions, has been
diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. He was ordered to be detained at the
State Hospital at Carstairs.
At least twice between 1987 and 1994 he was admitted as a patient to Royal
Cornhill Hospital, Aberdeen, and was pulled from Loch Ness last year. He was on
medication at the time of the attack.
Last night, there were calls for an inquiry into the case.
Mr John McAllion, Labour's Scottish health spokesman, called for an
investigation into why Gatt had been discharged from hospital.
``The circumstances of the case are tragic and it is obvious someone has made a
mistake, probably Cornhill,'' he said.
Mr McAllion said: ``Any lessons that can be learned from this case must be
learned. It underlines the need to maintain beds in hospitals, rather than
closing them down.''
Gatt's aunt, Gilbertha Gatt, said: ``I feel anger at the hospital and the
system that this could ever have been allowed to happen.''
She added: ``Nigel is a schizophrenic - he's not a violent murderer, he's just
ill. He needed help and we feel he was let down by the whole system.''
Dr Richard Scorgie, Grampian Healthcare medical director, said: ``I am
satisfied he received the best possible treatment. I fully support the judgment
of the clinicians in this case based on the facts available.''
Mr Scorgie added that an internal review into Gatt's case had been carried out
and a report submitted to the Mental Welfare Commission.
Detective Inspector Alan Smith, who led the inquiry, said after the case that
Gatt had told police officers that he believed it was a case of kill or be
killed.
``The battle is over. He has died. He fought bravely,'' said Gatt who, at 6ft
and weighing 15 stone, physically dominated his relative.
Gatt has been held at the State Mental Hospital at Carstairs since the murder
in the early hours of Monday, August 14.
Gatt's marriage of nine years broke up in the late 80s because of his ``mood
swings'' and he returned to Aberdeen to live with his grandparents, James and
Elizabeth.
Gatt was raised in the family home at Hollybank Place, Aberdeen, where the
killing took place.
His mother now lives in London but has been told of what happened by her family.
Police had had a number of dealings with Gatt in the hours leading up to the
death but nothing alerted them to what was to follow.
Gatt phoned them at 5.38am to say his grandfather was dead. Officers found Gatt
naked, shouting and screaming, with his victim lying in the bathroom.
In court yesterday, Gatt denied murdering his grandfather, claiming he was
insane at the time and not responsible for his actions.
The Crown and Gatt's legal team agreed that he assaulted his grandfather by
repeatedly punching him on the head and body, forcing paper into his mouth, and
repeatedly stabbing him.
They also agreed that Mr Gatt Sr died as a result of the attack and that his
grandson was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time.
A psychiatrist's report, which was read to the court, said: ``He believed that
his life was in danger from the Moonies.
``Gatt did not appreciate the wrongfulness of what he was doing,'' added Mr
Thomas White, a consultant forensic psychiatrist at Carstairs.
Another pyschiatrist from Carstairs, Ms Janice Duncan, said that Gatt had
``dangerous and violent propensities'' and both specialists recommended he be
cared for at the state hospital.
Lord Gill instructed the jury to acquit Gatt on the grounds of his insanity at
the time and ordered that he be detained at Carstairs.

THE Government's plans to allow private-sector financial institutions to enter
the student loans system came under attack last night.
Plans for banks and building societies to be allowed to compete with the
Glasgow-based Student Loans Company were criticised by MPs, who claimed the
exercise was Treasury-driven and would not benefit access to higher education.
Under the Student Loans Bill, which came up for its second reading in the
Commons yesterday, subsidies would be paid to chosen financial institutions to
enable them to make loans to students on the same preferential terms as the
existing company. Up to four institutions might be chosen through a competitive
bidding exercise.
Education and Employment Minister Eric Forth insists that students will get a
convenient and comprehensive service through access to lenders' branch
networks, and that choice will be improved, but his stance was criticised by
Scottish Labour MPs and other Opposition members.
Mrs Maria Fyfe (Glasgow Maryhill - Lab.) said students had been forced into
loans because their grants had been cut, to which Mr Forth responded that the
Government had wanted to switch the burden away from 100% reliance on grants
into loans.
Later in the exchanges, Mrs Fyfe came back at the Minister, claiming that
Citizen's Advice Bureaux in Scotland had had students coming to them asking for
help because they could not afford to buy food.
Mr Forth said he visited a number of campuses and was ``always impressed by the
number of students occupying the beer bars and enjoying the benefits of higher
education.'' He added: ``The vast majority of students run their money
responsibly and get by very well indeed. We must give support to those who
cannot, but it is wrong to suggest that all students are in hardship. It is
about how individual students manage their finances.''
Mr Tony Worthington, Labour MP for Clydebank and Milngavie, demanded to know
what the contact had been between the Chancellor and the Department for
Education and Employment to get student loans out of the public sector and
thereby help to lower Government borrowing.
Mr Forth insisted: ``Contact is close, harmonious and fruitful as ever.''
Former Scottish Minister Allan Stewart (Eastwood) said that the advantage of
using banks and building societies was that it provided them with the
opportunity, through their branch network, to build up a relationship with
students covering all their financial needs.
q.Liberal Democrat Education spokesman Don Foster told the Commons that
financial worries and fears of unemployment have led to a big rise in stress
and suicide among university students.
He had carried out a survey during the summer ``and the results were very
worrying''. He said that 72% of the 117 universities in the UK had responded to
his inquiries.
``The survey showed that, with rare exceptions, universities reported a
significant increase in the number of students seeking some form of
counselling.''
Replying, Mr Forth voiced reservations about some of the figures in the survey,
and dismissed Mr Foster's claim that drop-out rates were rising because of
stress.

A TORY MP told a court yesterday of his ``nightmare'' Christmas when his wife
shouted ``poofter, poofter'' at him as he prepared salad with a male friend.
Mr David Ashby told the High Court in London that his wife called him a
homosexual as a ``standard insult'' on many occasions during their 28-year
marriage. However, he said he had never had any homosexual tendencies.
Giving evidence in his libel action against the Sunday Times, Mr Ashby, 55,
said he left his wife, Silvana, in the autumn of 1993.
Mr Ashby said he had bought a flat in Putney, London, above Dr Ciaran Kilduff,
with whom Mrs Ashby became convinced he was having an affair.
Mr Ashby described a Christmas Eve in 1993 when his wife came to visit.
He and Dr Kilduff were in the kitchen washing salad when he heard a voice from
below saying ``poofters, poofters''. He went downstairs and found his wife
shouting through Dr Kilduff's letter-box.
Police arrived. His wife was still hysterical but their daughter, Alexandra,
27, managed to calm her down.
He also told the court of his friendship with Dr Kilduff. He said he started
chatting to Dr Kilduff when he viewed the flat and later booked on the same
flight to the US, where they were both heading on different trips, after Dr
Kilduff put him on to a cheap ticket agency.
During the nine-hour flight, the two talked and became friends.
``I confided in him about my life, my marriage, how I was, how I felt,
generally my unhappiness.
``It helps tremendously to talk about yourself to someone. I'd recommend it to
anyone.''
Asked by his QC, Mr Geoffrey Shaw, if he had many close friends at the time, Mr
Ashby said: ``I can honestly say I had none.''
Mrs Ashby, who had listened to much of her estranged husband's evidence with
her head in her hands, left court as he continued: ``I'd spent my life being
isolated - from my family because of Silvana's attitude. I had no close
friends, no-one to confide in.''
His daughter, who has sat at her father's side throughout the case, wiped away
tears as he said: ``I could have talked to my daughter but you can't burden
your daughter all the time. It's wrong.''
Asked if he had any homosexual inclinations at the time of his wedding, Mr
Ashby replied: ``Most certainly not. I never had then and I never have had.''
Dr Kilduff, he said, ``was and is a good friend''.
He denied ever making any admission to his wife or daughter that he was gay.
``Most certainly I didn't because to have said it would be untrue.''
Asked if his wife had made suggestions about men other than Dr Kilduff during
their marriage he said: ``Yes, on many, many, many occasions. It's almost a
standard insult actually.''
For the last six years or so of their marriage, they had fought every day, at
least once, maybe twice.
``And the fights were vicious, the language was vicious. I was very, very
unhappy. I was very depressed,'' said the MP for North-west Leicestershire.
By 1992, he had not had sex with his wife for three or four years because of
stress and depression.
His wife did talk about his impotence but not in a way to lead to discussion.
``She would say `you're no good' and that sort of thing. It was more `you're a
failure, you are not giving me much of a life'.''
Asked by Mr Shaw how he would react to the suggestion that he and Dr Kilduff
were preparing to set up home together, Mr Ashby said: ``It would be totally
and utterly untrue - and very offensive.''
In a bid to get over his ``rotten'' Christmas, Mr Ashby went to France with Dr
Kilduff. Dr Kilduff booked a room at a hotel and was offered a special rate for
a room which had one large bed.
``I didn't see any great thing about it. What was I supposed to do. Say to Dr
Kilduff `I am not sleeping with you'.''
He said they had dinner together and played cards downstairs and then he went
to the room before Dr Kilduff.
``I went to sleep and he went to sleep. Nothing more, nothing less.''
He said his wife had alleged frequently that he was having an affair with a
pupil barrister in his chambers called David, and a parliamentary research
assistant called Tim.
Mr Ashby is suing over a January 1994 article which said he had shared a bed
with a male friend on a holiday in Goa the previous November.
He says it alleged he was a practising homosexual who had misled Silvana about
the nature of his sexuality; that he had lied to the public about having an
affair with Dr Kilduff during a trip to France early in 1994; and that he was a
hypocrite in emphasising the importance of the family in his last election
address.
Times Newspapers Ltd and former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil deny libel,
although they accept that Mr Ashby did not holiday with a man in Goa. They
assert that he was and is carrying on an affair with Dr Kilduff.
Mr Ashby said the Sunday Times story was a deliberate attempt to destroy him
and possibly bring the Government down.
The hearing continues.

CAR-BASED lifestyles are creating a health ``time bomb'' for the next
generation, a doctor warned yesterday.
Dr Mayer Hillman claimed there could be an explosion in heart disease in 20 or
30 years' time caused by lack of exercise among children to whom society,
during the critical childhood years, had shown ``a careless attitude''.
He told ``The Future of Transport in Cities'' conference in Edinburgh:
``Through an oversight, we are creating a generation of battery-reared children
rather than the free-range children we were.''
Dr Hillman, senior fellow emeritus of the Policy Studies Institute - Britain's
leading independent research organisation undertaking studies of economic and
social policy - said Britain's policy on car ownership and transport planning
was limiting children's freedom of movement.
``Increasingly, the outside world is seen as a place where children are likely
to be injured by a motor vehicle or to be molested or assaulted. We have
created a generation of children denied the benefits of playing a role in life
as autonomous beings.''
He said there was also a decline in the quality of public places for children
to use as informal ``classrooms'' where they could acquire practical and social
skills and play a part in community life.
Dr Hillman said the present generation of children were also often denied the
benefits of playing a role in society's workings such as shopping and visiting,
and walking and cycling as modes of transport among children were in sharp
decline.
Warning of the consequences for their physical development without radical
change in policy, he said: ``We may have a time bomb on our hands which will
explode in 20 or 30 years when the incidence of heart disease rises sharply
owing to the insufficiency of exercise among children during the critical years
of childhood.
``And what about their character and social behaviour, the development of which
has been increasingly restricted during the early years of their lives?''
He called for a number of measures including, at transport level, a reduction
in the attractions of motorised travel and at planning level the discouragement
of longer distance patterns of travel and promotion of local activity in order
to ``re-populate streets''.
``Now that we have evidence of the harm we are doing to our children in this
country it is difficult to believe a civilised society will not wish to reverse
the process which has brought it about.''

A VIDEO recording showing a box allegedly containing terrorist weapons being
loaded into a car was shown to a jury yesterday.
The box, the High Court in Glasgow heard, contained a machine pistol and a
semi-automatic pistol, allegedly en route to the outlawed Ulster Volunteer
Force.
On trial are three Scots, a Liverpudlian, and two men from Northern Ireland.
One of the Irish accused is Lindsay Robb, 28, from Lurgan, who was a loyalist
negotiator during peace talks with the Government at Stormont earlier this year.
The others are John Johnston, 49, of Laurieston, Falkirk, Francis Hives, 45, of
Liverpool, William McArthur, 42, of Bonnybridge, David White, 29, of Airdrie,
and Alexander Davidson, 23, of Lurgan.
All six deny a plot to obtain weapons, ammunition, and explosives to further
the aims of the UVF intending to endanger life or cause serious injury to
property in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
The video film was shown during the evidence of tactical firearms officer
Constable Graham Moody, of Central Scotland Police, who told how he stopped an
estate car containing Mr McArthur, Mr Johnston, and Mr White and seized a box
containing the weapons.
He was shown a police surveillance video film which had been taken outside the
Market Public House in Prescott Road, Liverpool. It showed Mr McArthur putting
a box into the rear of the vehicle and Constable Moody agreed it appeared to be
the same box that he recovered with the guns inside it.
The court also heard about the arrest of Mr Robb at a house in Ferguson Street,
Ayr.
Detective Inspector William Prendergast of Strathclyde Police said Mr Robb was
in bed. He cautioned him and told him he had reasonable grounds to suspect that
he had been involved in the commission of, or inciting, acts of terrorism.
The officer also revealed that he took part in a search of Mr Johnston's home
at Campbell Crescent, Laurieston, where he claimed he found pieces of a handgun
under a pile of bricks in the garden.
Police firearms expert Sergeant Ronald Withers said that, although the machine
pistol had been home made, it was in working order, as was the Hungarian-made
semi-automatic pistol.
The trial continues.

WITH the nights drawn in and after I had recently returned from a week's work
in Manchester, thoughts of bringing back trams continue to rattle in my mind.
I am against the return of the tramcar to any of the streets of Scotland.
Imagine yourself in Manchester this month observing the ebb and flow of traffic
and pedestrians, prams and pushbikes. Four rails to negotiate in crossing the
street, long steel-lined holes three inches wide by three inches deep - four of
them!
A trap for pushchair wheels, heels of ladies' shoes, bike wheels, motorbike
wheels, walking-sticks, wee boys' trikes, wheelchairs, sweetie papers. And the
noise.
The teeth-edging squeal of steel wheels doing 90-degree turns and the grind of
steel against steel as the cars accelerate up to speed then grate to a halt
brought memories of being in digs at Mrs McDevit's on Great Western Road and
hearing the late trams whining away from Byres Road, clumping over Kelvin
Bridge, roaring past the digs, and vanishing with a rattle in the direction of
the Cowcaddens.
A sleep-disturbing five minute experience repeated regularly throughout each
evening.
The trolleybus is my answer. For those who do not know what this is, visit the
Transport Museum where by permission of the curator and helped by a voluntary
guide you will see and even board BUT trolleybus No 13 built in 1958. A
magnificent double-decker.
Glasgow Corporation operated a fleet of 194 trolleybuses from 1949 to 1967.
Most were double-decked but 10 were built as single-deckers and operated on the
route from Mount Florida to Shieldhall. What were the problems?
They were too quiet - you've got to be kidding - but no, they caused accidents
because of their ability to creep up on you unheard and when you stepped off
the pavement, wallop.
What are the advantages? They are very roomy; quiet, no noisy steel rails;
easily driven; they can be made in Scotland; they have battery back-up; they
are simple to maintain; no smelly and dangerous exhaust fumes; flexible road
use; can be financed by small bus operators; and have large passenger carrying
capacity.
Mind you, I would prefer a battery-powered bus but this is not feasible at
present. I dislike the thought of once again stringing disfiguring wires along
our streets but I know of no alternative.
Do those who form opinions and motivate decisions have any thoughts about
getting rid of the diesel bus and restoring the trolleybus and clean air to our
city centres?

THANKS to Murray Ritchie (November 20) I now understand why Norway did not vote
for joining the EU. It was that obligatory poster on the Brussels Schuman metro
naming the five most famous Norwegians that did it.
If Norway had joined the EU then Vidkun Quisling (who did not have a funny
moustache) had to be on that poster together with Ibsen and Grieg (with just as
much Scottish blood as Norwegian) to make up that list of the internationally
famous Norwegian five.
Murray Ritchie is far too modest when he muses about the names on a Scotland
poster of its famous five if and when Scotland joins the EU.
For Murray Ritchie to exclude Watt from the list of famous Scots is possibly
due to carelessness but why did he exclude Dunlop (pneumatic tyre), Macintosh
(international rainwear) and Mackintosh (architectural fame), McAdam (every
asphalted road is constructed to his design criteria), the 1st Baron of Lister
(whose contribution to medicine and the saving of lives is on par with
Pasteur's contributions to medicine), Lord Kelvin (and his internationally
recognised Kelvin temperature scale), and last but not least James Clerk
Maxwell, the father of the information technology revolution?
James Clerk Maxwell is not a household name even in his native country despite
his contribution to science having been on par with Newton and Einstein. (Is
this a consequence of the Scottish education system that appears to
hero-worship the arty-farty subsidy junkies more than scientific wealth
creators?)
In fact the list of internationally famous Scots is out of proportion to its
population. And I haven't even mentioned the engineering genius Telford or W
Christie, the father of the Norwegian independence/ separatist movement and the
first president of the Norwegian Parliament, or the father of the French
banking system, or the Scot who fathered Japanese technology.
My guess is that Scotland would never join the EU. For a starter whoever is in
charge of the allocation of poster space on the Brussels Schuman metro would
never agree to the poster space required to truly reflect Scotland's
significant contribution to the civilised world.
Secondly, Scots have now lost the ability even to critically analyse why
Norway, with comparable resources to Scotland but struggling to fill a poster
of famous fives, is as an independent country on the top of the economic league
whereas Scotland lingers at the bottom.

AMERICAN FOOTBALL
THE San Francisco 49ers' NFL resurgence continued with the return of
quarterback Steve Young and a 41-13 rout of divisional rivals St Louis Rams at
Candlestick Park.
Young, out for six weeks after a shoulder injury, looked as if he'd never been
away, throwing for 226 yards and three touchdowns as the Super Bowl champions
topped the NFC West with an 8-4 record. The Atlanta Falcons slumped to 7-5 when
a 28-yard field goal in overtime earned the Arizona Cardinals a 40-37 win.
Quarterback Dan Marino set an NFL record for TD passes - 346 - with four in the
Miami Dolphins' visit to Indianapolis, but the Colts won 36-28.
He has eclipsed three of the legendary Fran Tarkenton's passing records this
season - but each time the Dolphins have lost. They have now slumped to 6-6 in
the AFC East behind Buffalo Bills (8-4), who lost 35-25 to New England
Patriots, and Indianapolis (7-5).
In the AFC Central, Cleveland Browns lost 20-17 to Pittsburgh Steelers, who now
lead the division at 8-4.
Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre threw three touchdowns and running back
Dorsey Levens ran for two more as the Packers thrashed Tampa Bay Buccaneers
35-13 to lead the NFC Central.
Philadelphia Eagles continued their revival, with running back Ricky Watters
rushing for 124 yards and two touchdowns in a 14-7 win over the Washington
Redskins, propelling them to 8-4 and second place behind Dallas (10-2) in the
NFC East.
NFL week 13 results: Atlanta 37, Arizona 40; Carolina 26, New Orleans 34;
Chicago 27, New York Giants 24; Cincinnati 17, Jacksonville 13; Denver 33,
Houston 42; Miami 28, Indianapolis 36; New England 35, Buffalo 25; New York
Jets 16, Seattle 10; Philadelphia 14, Washington 7; Pittsburgh 20, Cleveland

THE Secretary of State for Scotland has moved to ensure that water charges
imposed by the Government's new water boards remain relatively low. In an age
of low inflation a cap of 6% on additional charges is not exactly low but it is
far lower than the 15% which was being talked about until this week. It is
almost certainly a good deal lower than the level the water businesses require
to start funding past under-spending as well as the higher costs anyhow
required to meet the very high quality specifications laid down in the water
directives issued by the European Commission. Water itself is free at the point
of precipitation as rain, but that indisputable fact gives quite the wrong
impression whenever it is considered in relation to its use for everything in
that connection is expensive. Left to itself water flows away. It has to be
collected and the resultant works and waterways are physically significant and
may involve civil engineering works of some scale. Moreover, once established,
such systems need care and maintenance, as the present concern in England about
loss of water through leakage demonstrates. Water for domestic use has to be
clean which may not be its state untreated. Lower standards may be possible for
industry, or where sewerage is concerned, but drinking water achieves a very
high quality everywhere in Scotland - at a cost.
Because such costs are high and because some local authorities had previously
neglected to spend as much capital as was needed to keep the physical systems
at the best level, the Government hoped that privatisation would take the whole
matter out of its hands (apart from the need to implement the directives and
ensure quality but fair charges through formal regulation). At a blow the
industry would receive the money it required, the consumer would be aghast, but
have to pay up, and the very high EU quality standards, on beaches as well as
from taps, would be met. That logic explained the English privatisations but
was blown apart by the way the heads of the new companies operated them. Public
resentment about the outcome of water privatisation south of the Border ensured
that similar mechanisms could not be introduced in Scotland: the distinct
political climate here made that impossible; but it changed nothing about the
need to spend large sums of money in water improvements.
Mr Forsyth's new stance has changed nothing either, though those who actually
pay for the water may be grateful for the fact that they will feel the pain of
paying somewhat less than they might have done. That, at any rate, is the
straightforward political calculation involved in the cap. Consumers will not
be up in arms at double-digit increases on their water bills and so an area of
political awareness which is totally unfavourable to the Government will
steadily lose its salience; even, possibly, Ministers will be viewed as water
users' friends. This is a testament to the power of democracy and the nature of
politics. It need not even mean that the required investment in the water
industry need be abandoned if the Government withdraws its opposition to
borrowing and allows part of the increased charges to be interest payments
rather than capital costs. Alternatively, it merely means deferring spending
which will have to take place one day, the very habit which produced the
under-funding now requiring to be addressed. Today's water payers may thank Mr
Forsyth but their successors may have a very different reaction. In between
lies the next General Election, certain to be hard fought.

Airdrie is a town which apparently boasts the highest concentration of
Scots-born people anywhere. John Linklater investigates a population phenomenon
AIRDRIE is bemused by its new status as the most Scottish town in Britain.
After decades suffering negative images founded on high unemployment,
sectarianism with its neighbour Coatbridge, and the unhappy accolade of heart
attack capital of the world, it has grown sensitive to unsolicited distinctions
awarded by outsiders, suspecting a catch.
With possible justification. Say something nice to an Airdrieonian and they
will suspect you of trying to get smart. The latest compliment could prove a
highly backhanded way of applying population statistics. Daniel Dorling, of the
geography department at the University of Newcastle, has started something with
research that focuses on Monklands District as boasting the highest
concentration of Scots-born people anywhere. That apparently makes Airdrie, and
Coatbridge for that matter, the most ethnically undiluted community in the
nation.
This is news to Airdrie. At the Weavers Cottages Museum on Frith-Rathad An
Tobair (as Wellwynd has been dual-linguistically signposted since the Mod came
here two years ago) it is gently pointed out there is little historical
justification for the claim. At each stage of the industrial revolution
Monklands attracted huge influxes from the Highlands and Ireland, weavers and
colliers and steel workers. Curator Allan MacKenzie, an East Kilbride man, is
highly sceptical.
Besides, the researchers' figure of less than 4% of Monklands people coming
from outwith Scotland (compared to 8% throughout the rest of Scotland) looks
suspiciously as though it might invite another construction. It could be yet
another form of putdown of Airdrie, implying it is the least attractive place
in Scotland anyone would want to move into.
Local pride will not stand for that. The town is just finishing its
celebrations of 300 years since it received its Market Charter by Act of
Scottish Parliament. The current best-selling video in town is Airdrie: A Brief
History. If you want to buy a copy you will have to wait until new supplies
arrive later this week. The film-maker, Robert Letham, might be able to help,
according to Airdrie Public Library. He lives in Mull. This turns out to be
Mull, the Airdrie housing estate. They don't need any tourists or incomers to
patronise their heritage.
``There are only two kinds of people,'' says 22-year-old Iain Allison, a recent
graduate of Glasgow Caledonian University. ``There are Airdrieonians and people
who want to be Airdrieonians.'' Taking us for the latter, he outlines the
attractions: ``There is unemployment, problems with heart disease and
alcoholism, and not much life. But I'm an ardent Airdrieonian and I walk up the
town with a sense of pride. I will be a very disappointed man if I ever have to
move out of here. I want to die here.''
Barman Gary MacKay had two years in Manchester where he encountered ``the most
ignorant bunch of people I have met in my life''. He came to his senses and
returned to his native Airdrie. The happiest moment in his kindred relationship
with Airdrie was finding a bottle of 12-year-old whisky from the local
Inverhouse Distillery at a service station outside of Milan. He read the export
label, proclaiming Product Of Airdrie, and felt great.
Neither is this the furthest that Airdrie sons have travelled, and felt drawn
back. Bobby Flavell, wartime football star of Airdrieonians FC, was playing in
the same side as Alfredo Di Stefano with the Millianarios of Bogota in
Colombia. ``Bogota was a lot hotter,'' he concedes. But out in his bunnet on
Graham Street, having a good natter with two old fiends, this seems a
superfluous advantage to the warmth of local camaraderie in a town which was
his birthplace in 1921.
``Coatbridge was famous for coal and steel,'' says his mate, John Dougan. ``And
Airdrie was famous for stealing coal.'' There may be a severe lack of pitheads
from which to carry on this local enterprise, and there may be no more
Broomfield at which to admire the skills of latter-day Flavells, but Airdrie
survives undaunted.
The search for an immigrant presence does, however, prove difficult. Lisa
McLaren, who has spent years of her young life in culturally alien places as
Edinburgh, Livingston, and Teneriffe, likes the slow-paced and welcoming
atmosphere of the town. But she is really from Glasgow. At the Big Apple
Amusements arcade we find a lady who once lived in Northampton and couldn't
stand it. There are plenty of folk who make it clear they are not from Airdrie
at all, but from Caldercruix or Chapelhall or Glenboig, anxious to make the
distinction of a few miles.
Finally, we catch up with June McKenna back where we started at the museum. She
came to Airdrie 20 years ago from London. ``It's a better sense of humour
here,'' she explains. ``It's more a Billy Connolly sense of humour than in
London.'' Tell that to the researchers.

LIKE its political prototype, the ``New Alliance'' is Franco-Scottish, a series
of five Edinburgh concerts by mostly French performers featuring mostly French
music promoted by the French Institute of Scotland. The aims are ambitious, and
Radio Three is recording the results, which last night placed Poulenc's
beautiful, unsettling violin sonata in a not wholly appropriate context of
Richard Strauss and Beethoven.
With instrumentalists as talented as Raphael Oleg and Eric Le Sage, it was to
be expected that Poulenc's characteristically oblique and poetic elegy on the
death of Federico Garcia Lorca would receive a particularly perceptive
performance, and so on the whole it proved. But both here, as in the rest of
the programme, the effect was undermined by a failure to strike a satisfactory
balance between violin and piano tone. Playing with the lid fully open, Le Sage
sometimes swamped his partner.
Yet in a curious way the more virile passages worked better than the
introspective ones, where Poulenc's fine-grained melodies lacked their
essential soft gleam. But the ending, when it came, carried the right sense of
shock, and Poulenc's very French vein of bitter-sweetness contrasted tellingly
with the richer, more self-indulgent sentiment of Strauss's early violin sonata.
Finally, there was Beethoven's Kreutzer in a performance that did not lack
sweep but never came fully into focus. The heavy piano tone, and the pianist's
noisy pedalling, were unfortunate distractions for which the good points of the
rest of the playing never completely compensated.

BRITISH Investment Trust kept pace with its bench-      mark index during the
six months      to September 30 and announced a modest increase in the interim
dividend, writes ROBERT POWELL.
Net asset value of the  #788.5m trust rose 12.4% to 253p.
This was right in line with a 12.4% rise in the MSCI World index in sterling
terms, but a shade less than the FT Actuaries All-Share index, which rose 12.7%.
Earnings per share fell back after being inflated by two large dividends in the
first half of 1994, which were missed in the first half of this year because of
a change in the timing of payouts.
But as a gesture of confidence, the trust raised its interim dividend by 4.8%
to 2.1p and promised to maintain this increase in the final.
The trust, managed by Edinburgh Fund Managers, aims for long-term capital and
income growth. Its largest single investment is an #88m stake in Edinburgh Fund
Managers itself.

Building on natural principles
AT around the age of nine, Rudolph Steiner believed, children should be
introduced to forms of work based on craft and skill, knowledge of materials,
and the environment. He went so far as to advocate a spell of housebuilding.
Recognising the educational value of drawing up plans and calculations,
therefore, the Austrian humanist would have thoroughly approved of an unusual
architectural practice based in a Deeside community run on Steiner lines.
Led by Wolodymr Radysh and David Sutherland, Camphill Architects lies at the
heart of the 145-acre Newton Dee Camphill community for handicapped adults,
five miles from Aberdeen.
The firm specialises in an ``organic'' style of architecture, characterised by
rounded forms, natural materials and colour-washed walls in therapeutic shades,
which bears out Steiner principles. It was one of the first offices of its kind
in the world and, 20 years on, is now the largest in Britain.
Worldwide, there are 80 communities like Newton Dee, with eight in Scotland.
Being in the unusual position of having a large and stable client base in the
British communities (continental ones tend to employ their own architects)
Camphill Architects has never needed to tender for business in the commercial
world - although it does accept mainstream commissions and is in competition
with other architects for work in UK Camphills.
``Between 50% and 70% of our work is with Scottish communities,'' David
Sutherland explained. ``The remainder is split between the rest of Britain,
including Ireland, and eastern Europe. We've also done a care house in the USA.
One of our architects (the practice employs six, plus a mentally-handicapped
adult) recently returned from Israel. We move around a lot.''
Increasingly, this type of architecture is being recognised and valued by the
wider community too. CA was commissioned to design a church for the Christian
Community in Aberdeen. But it is in the realm of caring establishments that its
soothing brand of social consciousness really comes into its own. The #600,000
Blackthorn Medical Centre in Maidstone, for example, was designed for people
suffering from serious or long-term illness, and patients who use it are
shielded from sensory jolts of all kinds.
The success of this building led to a commission for St Luke's Medical Centre
in Stroud. ``We've completed our documentation work and building starts next
year,'' Mr Sutherland said.
Last week, the Royal Institute of British Architects bestowed its White Rose
Award on CA's design for a church at Botton Camphill Community in Yorkshire.
But while such accolades afford satisfaction, CA is not in the business of
accruing profit. Three of its professionals are self-employed and salaried; the
other three receive no salary and are supported by the Newton Dee community
where they live as house-parents. Mr Sutherland is one of them.
``When I go home, I'm caring for the needs of eight handicapped adults. In our
architectural practice and our workshops, all profits are ploughed back into
the community,'' he said. The practice tries to avoid complicated accounting,
charging the same rate for all its work. ``We do lose out on some projects. The
building is of paramount importance - profit isn't our guiding principle.''
Turnover is #165,000.
Since Camphill communities came into existence more than 50 years ago, there
has been a feeling they have remained too isolated from the ``real'' world. Mr
Sutherland, an Australian who practiced in that real world until he was 42 and
has since tutored part-time at the Scott Sutherland School of Architecture,
explained that in some respects integration had been forced upon them.
``With the advent of registration, most of the communities are now licensed
care establishments - we've had to interface with regulations like stipulated
size for bedrooms and fire precautions.''
But external pressures can only help to dispell any idiosyncratic notions
surrounding these communities which were set up to respect human individuality.
A proposed social centre and workshops in the Newton Dee community should build
on this new awareness of society as a whole. CA recently completed plans for a
#630,000 coffee/gift shop accessible to the public.
The natural timber structure in the shape of a crescent reflects its woodland
setting. It will have a clay-tiled roof and express the characteristic
``Steiner'' style - a design for flesh and blood.
``We try to make all forms organic, to make them to relate to the function of a
building,'' Mr Sutherland said. ``We're not averse to the rectangle, but we do
try not to be dominated by it.''

n MILLS &amp; Boon gets saucy this Christmas with a romance revival kit of 365 Ways
To Be Romantic (at #4.99 almost certainly a more economical way of repairing
the parlous state of marriage in Britain than through reform of the divorce
laws) which suggests making love in the bathtub or even kidnapping your lover
alongside sure fire winners like ``Place a flower on her pillow. Just because.
. .''; although the gay abandon of ``Everyone should, at one time or another in
his or her life, go skinny-dipping'' seems a wee bit optimistic even in a mild
November.
n IN preparation for those wild romantic nights, Cutex suggests a daily workout
for the lips to exercise the surrounding muscles and keep them in shape; this
involves pressing a kiss against a finger (preferably your own) held up to the
lips for a count of five; no clenching of teeth or allowing the tongue to press
against the roof of the mouth, however: ``This would just create tension in the
wrong areas.'' French kissing, one assumes, would simply wreak havoc with your
muscle tone.
n BETTER to settle down with a good book; and in the romantic vein, Scottish
Love Stories, published by Polygon on Thursday, looks set to be a bit of an eye
opener. ``Tales of love and desire, lust and passion, romance and a touch of
humour'' are promised from new Scottish authors, gay and lesbian writers and
well-known favourites.
n ON the subject of another form of writing, publicity for Maggie Black's new
Jane Austen Cookbook says the volume features ``dishes which Jane Austen
herself, and famous characters like Mr Darcy from Pride and Prejudice would
have enjoyed''; whereas anyone who saw the delicious Colin Firth bristling away
as Darcy in the recent BBC adaptation would know he had very little stomach for
anything but standing glowering by the fire; indeed, one can hardly imagine him
sitting down to anything like a hearty meal, unless it were a dish of sour
grapes, perhaps, or or a final helping of humble pie.
n EATING features prominently on the new Ryvita publicity campaign; a five-step
guide to health. 1, exercise; 2, eat little and often (ie Ryvita); 3, healthy
breakfast (hello, Ryvita again); 4, stock up on carbohydrate and fibre (guess
what); 5, cut down on fat (I'll spare you the details). In case you're finding
the whole thing rather difficult to swallow you're also offered fun new ways to
enjoy the Ryvita experience, all of which involve a trip down to the deli or
the expensive bit of M &amp; S for salmon and walnut halves. Good try, but you can
have rather too much of a good thing, you know.
n BUT not in the bedrooms of Britain, apparently, where the average frequency
of sex has dropped over the last year, according the Durex Report 1995. Yes,
for those who can remember, it's averaging out at 70 times a year, down from
1994's high of 73. The survey also found that fewer people are worried about
contracting HIV - although the numbers indulging in unprotected sex are slowly
dropping (and that means more condoms sold; good news for Durex, there, one
imagines). And finally, we learn that more than 60 per cent of us buy our
condoms in chemists, although the report draws our attention to the
``significant'' 8 per cent who rely on vending machines - a figure which would
have been far more significant if it had included the thousands of hopefuls who
feed their money through the slot with nary a sign of a packet in sight, being
then too embarrassed to complain to the management.

Cressida Wilson may dismiss her acclaimed play as simply ``sexy and funny'',
but Sara Villiers discovers a highly-crafted and lyrical work
SHE makes a living out of drama but Erin Cressida Wilson insists her life is
not a dramatic one. Her play Cross Dressing in the Depression won her great
acclaim when it premiered in San Francisco and immediately transferred off
Broadway in 1993, but hers is neither a tale of a starving artist in a
Manhattan garret nor an overnight success.
``It's hard for me to describe my career because the truth is it's always been
very steady,'' shrugs the 32-year-old New York playwright. ``It's never been
horrible and it's never been incredibly successful.''
Renowned in her home country, her work is about to be introduced to a wider
audience. Peter Mackie Burns is to direct the European premiere of Cross
Dressing in the Depression, at the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh. It is the
story of a man haunted by a childhood of being brought up in a brothel.
Cressida Wilson wrote the drama over a number of years. ``It takes ages to
write a play,'' she says with a self-deprecation which belies the fact she has
written 17 plays over the past 10 years - and originally populated Cross
Dressing with 25 characters.
``It finally dawned on me that with the state of theatre and finance being what
it was, it would never get produced so I changed it, at first to a
two-character play for me and my best friend and then to a three-character
play.''
She reduced the characters by the expediency of playing all the female roles
herself, a task to be undertaken by Molly Innes in Edinburgh, but says although
she originally trained as an actress and always supplemented her play writing
income with spells on the stage and in soap operas she does not normally write
for herself.
``Cross Dressing is the only play of my own that I've acted in and I haven't
acted in every production of it. Each time it's been done, it has been done
very differently but it's always been done very beautifully. There has actually
been some cross dressing productions of the play. New York, the little boy, has
been played by a woman who was wonderful, she was 36-years-old but everyone who
saw it believed she was a 15-year-old boy.
``And there has been a production where the old man has been played by a woman
too, which is fascinating because of the pre-sexuality of the boy and the
post-sexuality of the old man. The energy of the woman is really interesting in
those roles.''
Currently teaching play writing at Duke University, she regards herself as an
uncategorisable writer.
``Well, I'm not writing about popular things - ie I'm not writing about gay
themes which seems to be all that anyone in New York is writing about just
now.''
HER most recent play is Hurricane, which she muses is about ``five people in a
one act play of related scenes on the subject of the war in America on gender,
sex, women and the right to be alone.''
Asked if she is a feminist, she answers with a response typical of her
generation. ``No. Yes. Of course. I was young enough to take that for granted,
but it got shoved in my face so much when I was at college, which was an all
women college, I got turned off.''
She reflects that as she gets older she understands feminism more. ``When
you're in your twenties and doing stuff everyone thinks that you're pretty
cute, you know what I mean? But there really is something that happens to you
when you come 30 and I didn't anticipate that.
``Now I'm not sure about things any more and I think the way I feel is
expressed in Hurricane - about the real honest to goodness need for something
to happen, for things to change. I mean, you realise that the socio-economic
history of women really is a case of rape all the time and I know that sounds
melodramatic but it's true and it's a very big struggle for me in my mind.''
Cressida Wilson is self-consciously ironic about the politically correct
stranglehold on culture in the States. ``There's this big joke in America just
now that the worst thing you can be is a white man and to some extent there's
something in that but basically it's a lot of bullshit.''
She cuts her conversation short with the remark that she hates to theorise
about her own work, summarising that what she has to say is about ``not making
statements''.
However, for all her dismissive comments of Cross Dressing in the Depression as
being simply ``sexy and funny'' it made a big enough noise to be included in a
collection of the best plays of 1993, while the deeply lyrical quality of her
work is recognised to the extent Hurricane is being published in the American
Poetry Review. Cressida Wilson might not like making statements but she's
certainly worth listening to.

Scottish women are mobilising in an offensive aimed at putting issues of
violence and abuse firmly on the agenda, as SUE INNES discovers
ON Saturday in Edinburgh a group of around 30 women held up traffic in Princes
Street with a banner saying ``Stop Trafficking in Women''. It was the first
direct action by a new group called Feminist Offensive - and they promise more.
The women who set up FO all work or volunteer for Scottish organisations
already involved in day to day support services to survivors of rape and other
violence, and in more conventional campaigning against violence against women.
In that everyday work they see the connections between the kinds of violence
against women and children, and to social and political issues, but felt it has
become less possible to express that.
``We all believe that all violence against women and children is linked, and is
part of a wider societal problem. But in our work you're mainly focusing on
individuals and on single issues, for example you might only be working with
incest survivors. And in campaigning, again you tend to focus on one aspect,
domestic violence, say. There was a gap in terms of an organisation able to
campaign more broadly and in a feminist way. And we wanted to do something,
well, a bit spikier . . .''
The constraints on what organisations can say when they depend on local and
central government funding is also a factor; FO is completely independent.
I spoke to two members of the group, in Edinburgh and Glasgow and, for now
anyway, they think it best to remain anonymous - ``as much because we don't
want the group to be identified with any one individual or organisation. We're
not working that way.''
Their idea is to be pro-active. ``We're always so reactive - whether it's
commenting on legislation, or what- ever - we're responding to what someone
else has decided is important. ``For organisations working against violence -
and also for underfunded feminist organisations - it's all crisis work. You're
responding to a phone call, a woman at the door or whatever. But we realised
that if we wanted a feminist perspective on violence to be in the mainstream we
were going to have to put it there.''
The emphasis at the centre of the group's message is that, as articulated in
the Zero Tolerance campaign, ``male abuse of power is a crime''. ``We live in a
society where men have more power than women. This power is built into the way
the country is run.'' Not all men benefit from it to the same extent, nor all
women suffer from it to the same extent; but some men abuse this power in order
to hold on to it.
``All women live with the fear of male violence, whatever their age, race,
sexuality and ability. It is our experience that in our homes and in our
communities men use emotional, sexual, financial and physical violence to
control women.''
So many women who have suffered domestic violence talk of being battered for
not getting the tea on the table at the right time, or for behaving ``wrongly''
according to varying rules. The belief that what happens behind closed doors is
best kept there and that it is important to keep family secrets is still a
powerful force.
Family violence is presented as unusual by ignoring the evidence for its
prevalence and by identifying it with people who are ``not like us''. But we
cannot, they argue, even talking of extreme cases like the West family, make a
separation between abuse which is enabled by power relationships and social
neglect and abusers who are sick: ``They are one and the same and violence
against children in families is not unusual.''
The more domestic and sexual violence are being paid public and political
attention, they argue, the more it is being seen as pathological, as about
individual aberrance. The debate, they say, is shifting away from seeing it as
a problem of power, and inequality - between women and men, between adults and
children, and of economic power and dependence. ``The response to the Rosemary
West case is an example. It's extreme but it's being talked about in a way that
reinforces a false message that child abuse only happens in dysfunctional
families, or where there is a cycle of abuse - but we know it happens in
`ordinary' families.''
Recent research in Glasgow and London emphasises that although they are seen as
separate, domestic violence, sexual abuse and child sexual abuse can be
strongly interlinked, with domestic violence sometimes used to facilitate and
to disguise child sexual abuse.
Saturday was chosen to start the campaign as it was International Day of
Protest against Violence against Women, with a programme of events in Scottish
cities, and around the world. FO is controversial in the women's movement,
partly because of the military connotations of its name. However, the group's
main concern is to find ways to influence the political agenda, as well as to
counter some of the myths and false messages or emphases in the ``violence
debate''.
Law-abiding events, like conferences and press releases, are not ruled out
either. ``Any effective method, as long as it isn't violent.''
Saturday's focus on the international trade in women and children for
prostitution and pornography was to emphasise that it's a huge problem, and
it's not just ``over there''. There is growing evidence of women from the Third
World being brought to Europe under false pretences and finding themselves
trapped in the sex industry; and sex tourism has become a fact of life.
Research by a coalition formed by Christian Aid and others shows that a high
proportion of those who travel to the Far East for under-age sex are from
Britain. The group are particularly concerned at how successfully the Internet
has added a sinister new dimension and is facilitating international links for
prostitution as well as allowing a massive increase in the spread of child
pornography. ``There's one firm called, if you can believe it, Pimps`R'Us who
offer a four-day package to the Dominican Republic with computer lessons thrown
in to make it tax deductible!''
Advertising Thai, Filipino, Russian and Romanian women for sex and the
explosion of paedophile links through the Internet may seem a distant and
almost intractable problem - ``but it's in Scottish living rooms, perhaps even
schools''. We need to recognise that ``Western money is funding it and buying
it.''
It may seem too huge a problem and remote, certainly from Saturday afternoon
shopping - yet in Princes Street shops you can find ``top shelf'' magazines
with barely-coded advertisements for child pornography. And our refusal as a
society to address these issues is spelled out in that fact that the Obscene
Publications Squad has only 17 officers in the UK. ``Even as feminists we make
excuses, we look the other way. Lots of women and men would be outraged at the
thought that they were condoning rape and abuse - why is it that everyone goes
silent when you talk about porn?''
The use of ``soft porn'' magazines to provide access to more ``specialist''
pornography is a major concern, but also the way that as adult porn becomes
both more acceptable and more extreme, this may be (as the police believe)
fuelling more extreme, bizarre and violent material in the `hard core'. And
``whether it is getting worse is difficult to say - but it is certainly
becoming more available.''
A change in international or country law will not help, they believe, unless
social attitudes and ignorance changes first, until we stop averting our eyes.

Every year experts warn a flu virus will sweep the country. Margaret Vaughan
examines the syptoms but finds accurate prognosis is no easy task
SORE head, shivery, aching, with a cough like a barking seal? Feeling like a
close first cousin of death? Feel in need of some tender care and sympathy?
Tough. It's only flu.
On the other hand, it may not be. If after 48 hours or so you are still hacking
and broiling you may be suffering from microplasma pneumoniae. Never mind. It's
not as bad as it sounds, so buck up.
It could be worse. It might be respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). On the other
hand, it may be no more than a snuffling cold so stop whining, take a
paracetamol and wait until you feel better.
If you think this a flippant response to the predicament of all those tucked
up, groaning, in bed with a raging fever, don't blame me. Just you try talking
to public health consultants around the country, the people you feel should
empathize with your runny nose and wheezy chest and desperate calls for another
hot toddy before it's too late.
Dire warnings from experts that a flu epidemic threatens at Christmas have
become as seasonal as the Queen's Message, if less reliable in delivery. So
will there be, as the Royal College of Practitioners in England predicted
yesterday, a raging epidemic this year? Hard to say. Because, when you analyse
all the figures, digest the statistics, follow the flow charts, and get right
down to it, no-one really has a clue.
The odds are slightly lower than winning the lottery, but not as good as
putting a tenner on the favourite at Kelso.
Dr Charles Saunders, the consultant in public health for Fife Health Board,
says that compared with this time last year, across Scotland there have been
more cases of flu reported by ``spotter practices'', GPs who report on numbers
of flu-like cases.
The strain showing up this year is mainly influenza A, while last year it was
influenza B, the type more commonly associated with major epidemics.
Dr Saunders says:, ``Now, in general, influenza is not a serious illness.
People who have it feel like death but they usually recover within a relatively
short time without treatment beyond fluids, painkillers and rest.
``There are certain people with pre-existing medical conditions who are more
vulnerable to flu, such as those with heart, lung or kidney infections, the
frail elderly, very young children or people whose immune system is not working
as it should. They ought to have been offered a flu jab in October, or early
November to protect them.
``So what you have left are relatively fit adults for whom immunisation is not
recommended, and although flu makes you feel rotten, that's an end of it.''
Major epidemics tend to come when there is a major change in the strain of flu
rampaging around the world: if the strain has mutated, fewer people will have
developed antibodies to it. There is no evidence at all this year that a
mutating flu virus is about to strike . . .yet.
``I can't predict it. All I can say is there are no indications we have a
radical strain of flu circulating at the moment,'' says Dr Saunders.
Feeling better then? Ah but . . . ``The difficulty is that although the experts
know what strains have been around, what they don't know is how many people
have antibodies to that strain. It is a reasonably educated guess. What you
can't do is predict accurately what is going to happen in the future.
In Fife, for instance, reported cases were much higher than last year, but in
recent weeks have gone down. Whether that's because fewer people are calling
out their doctors or whether there are fewer cases around is difficult to
predict.
Dr Saunders confides: ``I would not stick any money on either.''
Why do flu outbreaks always occur around this time anyhow? ``A question I've
often asked myself, and no-one knows - but there is a theory that various new
strains start to spread from the Far East and China.
``It's thought that the virus spreads backwards and forwards between humans and
some animals, particularly pigs. Because, in those areas, humans live in closer
contact with their animals than in the developed world, the theory runs that
the virus goes backwards and forwards between the rural farmer and his stock.
``It just so happens that by the time it reaches Europe it happens to be around
Christmas.
``The other factor is that the virus transmits more readily when windows and
doors are closed and fires are blazing.''
Dr Ian Stewart, consultant in public health medicine for Greater Glasgow Health
Board, says the flu figures were creeping up in November. However, the figures
are not precise, and neither is the diagnosis always accurate. It is a very
rough and ready tally. This can be because the illness is ``flu-like'' as
opposed to flu. The RSV bug which swept the country last year can seem like
flu, as can microplasma pneumoniae. Both respond to antibiotics, because they
are bugs, while flu does not because it is a virus. So how do you know the
difference?
``You can't. You'll have to wait for 48 hours and if you're cough is no better,
call out your family doctor.''
There you have it. A flu epidemic may be on the way. Or it may not not. If your
head is birling, if you feel the urge to lie down, wrap up warm but don't
expect any sympathy. It's only flu.

NEWT Gingrich, Speaker of the House of Representatives, announced today that he
will not run for president next year. The decision leaves Senator Bob Dole in a
yet stronger position to win the Republican nomination.
Gingrich has made no secret of his ambitions, but concluded that 1996 would not
be the year for him.
In a news conference in Marietta, Georgia, in his district office, he said that
he would ``postpone the decision to a long way down the road''. He added that
he could not imagine any new circumstances that might change his mind.
``We've decided that we would explicitly, definitely close the door so there's
no more speculation. I will not run next year for president,'' Gingrich said.
``My intent is to run for re-election to the House and hopefully be speaker
again.''
He said that he had decided to miss next year's election in order to
concentrate on the Republican programme in Congress.
``Looking at the way things are developing,'' he said. ``We are a month behind
where I hoped we would be in balancing the budget.''
He asserted that his legislative programme, of which the balanced budget was
the centre-piece, was the most important in 60 years. He expects to complete it
in the course of the next year.
Gingrich said he thought it would be difficult to be speaker and run a national
campaign for president. ``I agree with my family and many constituents that my
work as speaker of the House is more important at this time as we work on
balancing the budget and renewing the American dream,'' he said in a statement
released by his office.
He told said the budget battle was ``the most important single decision about
the future of our children and grandchildren and it's very important that we
really focus over the next few weeks to make sure we actually get to a balanced
budget that's real, that occurs in seven years and that changes things.''
Clinton and the Republican-led Congress remain divided over tax and spending
priorities and over ways to balance the budget. Their dispute partly closed the
government for six days this month, the longest such shutdown.
He also suggested that the election could be the ``wildest'' in years. He
speculated that there might be five candidates: Republican, Democratic,
moderate Democratic, plus Ross Perot and Jesse Jackson.
A number of departing and former members of Congress met over Thanksgiving to
discuss the possibility of running a candidate. They included Paul Tsongas, who
ran against President Clinton in the Democratic primaries in 1992, Ben Bradley,
Democratic senator in New Jersey who is not running next year.
It was an exploratory meeting, and despite Gingrich's hopes, it does not seem
probable that it will nominate anyone. Tsongas conceded that the group would
not put up a candidate unless he stood a chance of winning, for fear of
siphoning votes from President Clinton and helping the Republicans.
Gingrich had been toying with the idea of running in the Republican primaries
for months, and stirred up constant speculation. His supporters contend that
Senator Dole cannot defeat President Clinton.
On the other hand, all the polls show that Gingrich is deeply unpopular and
would do even worse against the president. He was asked this morning about his
unpopularity, and answered that he was no more unpopular now than was Barry
Goldwater when he won the Republican nomination in 1964.
Gingrich, who is a historian, had apparently forgotten that Goldwater went down
to the worst defeat in modern American politics.
Meanwhile, US Senate Republican leader Bob Dole today won the endorsement of
Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson in his front-running bid for the Republican
Party's presidential nomination.
Thompson, who had once been reported to be considering a run for the nomination
himself, said Dole ``stands head and shoulders above the rest of the Republican
field.''
He said Dole ``stood firm in the battle for a balanced budget against Bill
Clinton and his liberal Democratic allies. And when push came to shove, Bill
Clinton blinked. Because of Bob Dole's leadership.......the American people
will have the first balanced budget in a generation.''
Dole named Thompson a national co-chairman of his campaign.

AGAIN, we're looking at the results of having a full-time support agency, in
this case Edinburgh's Dance Base, available as a resource not just for
dance-makers but also for programmers. The Assembly Alive! season has
undoubtedly benefitted from the local audience that turns out for Dance Base
events.
Dance Base has, in its turn, been able to present programmes of new works in a
professionally-rigged and well-equipped space - something their own budget
doesn't really run to as often as the team would like. Saturday's double bill
of new work was labelled Gaining Ground.
Whereas the previous night's programme, Springboard, had tended towards the
unfledged end of the spectrum, this package had a more considered, experienced
feel to it even if the works themselves were capable of further thought and
development.
MOR - Brigid McCarthy's solo, an Assembly Alive! commission - confirmed her
interest in the ``mechanics'' of movement: What comes before a fall, what
follows the momentum of a roll? Movement, when taken down into its component
parts can seem just academic to an audience, but McCarthy has a sense of humour
and a breezy kind of confidence that is very eye-catching. The introduction of
middle-of-the-road music after initial silence really perked the piece into
Gidget Goes Minimalist.
There were echoes of early V-TOL in the fast, energised bursts of dance that
punctuated Tears Before Bedtime's foray into inner space, entitled Honest.
Individuals whose lives are hinted at through amplified phone calls come
together but don't really relate - all they seem to share is an occasional
frenzy of isolation.
When it moves, it moves quite purposefully but the framework, like the
phonecalls, stays a shade too indistinct to make us connect with the ideas
lurking somewhere in the atmospheric shadows.

There were many losers in the war for Distillers, but one man refused to stay
beaten. Jack Webster looks at the lives transformed by a takeover scandal
ONCE hailed as Scotland's most successful business figure, the man with the
Midas touch, James Gulliver can relax in his gracious Edinburgh townhouse and
talk philosophically about that high drama of the eighties which changed the
course of his life.
The grocer's son from Campbeltown, who rose to form his massive Argyll Group,
owner of supermarkets like Safeway and Presto, was commonly acknowledged as the
principal victim of the 1986 takeover scandal in which Guinness gained control
of Distillers, Scotland's largest company.
It came to court as the industrial story of the century and ended with the
chairman of the gigantic drinks company, Ernest Saunders, and two other City
figures being sent to prison in 1990 for the methods used in winning that
battle, at the expense of Gulliver's Argyll.
Careers were wrecked and fortunes changed as Saunders, the Viennese-born son of
an obstetrician who came to Britain in 1938, led the trek to jail.
Sentences now served, the matter went belatedly to the Court of Appeal, with
talk of fresh evidence bringing the whole Guinness trial back into the public
arena. But now that appeal has been dismissed.
So what has happened to the various parties involved - from the directors of
Distillers to the men who found themselves as Her Majesty's unwelcome guests?
James Gulliver now plies between his house in Chelsea and the Edinburgh one
where Robert Louis Stevenson would once have been a neighbour.
On the question of yesterday's court decision, he told me: ``I'm delighted the
appeal has been thrown out. Indeed, if it had gone the other way I would
personally have taken legal action against those involved.''
Pondering what might have been, Gulliver says: ``If Argyll had won the takeover
battle we would have been one of the largest companies in Britain. So yes, I
still feel cheated.
``It was very disappointing that we failed to acquire Distillers because of the
malpractice which existed on the other side. I felt a bit cynical after it was
over and decided to leave Argyll and spend more time in Scotland. But you
cannot go on harbouring regret because that is a very unhealthy thing to do.''
Gulliver's place as boss of Argyll was taken by his chief lieutenant,
fellow-Scot Alistair Grant, and the public perception was that his position was
not helped by a revelation, attributed to the ``dirty tricks'' department, that
an entry in Who's Who was untrue.
He was gone and a career which had been hailed as a model to students of
business shrewdness began to lose direction.
He became executive chairman at the home furnishings chain of Lowndes Queensway
but times were bad.
``Interest rates were soaring, consumer spending was drying up and we ran into
difficulties,'' he remembers. ``The banks came up with a re-financing package
but I decided to resign.''
He became chairman of the 200-year-old Edinburgh stationery firm of Waverley
Cameron, with a 30% stake and high hopes for its development. But that too
struck difficult times and they parted company.
Of his London-based interests, City Gate Estates was sold to a Swedish group
and his Broad Street public relations firm went to French owners.
Diverted by the Distillers battle and unable to give full attention to his
vice-chairmanship of Manchester United FC, Gulliver sold his 16% of the Old
Trafford club for less than #500,000, a decision he deeply regrets.
From there it was onwards to a similar post at Heart of Midlothian, where he
was welcomed by chairman Wallace Mercer, but when the Edinburgh property man
moved out and went to live in France, Gulliver relinquished his football ties.
So where does that leave him now, at the age of 65? ``More relaxed than if I
had been running a giant company,'' he smiles. ``We have family property
interest in London and Manchester, the top-quality Lords of the Manor hotel
near Cheltenham and two farms in Fife. I'm reasonably well-off and pretty
happy.''
Outwith the family investments, Gulliver is backing a Crinan company which is
farming scallops on the seabed. And he has taken a financial interest in the
Drum and Monkey pub in the centre of Glasgow, which has also opened up in
Edinburgh.
Just occasionally, he confesses, there is an itch for the bigger-time but he
generally thinks better of it.
So what of the others involved in the saga? John Connell was chairman of
Distillers in that 1980s period when the business view was that he was leading
a fuddy-duddy company which lacked consistent growth and aggressive management.
It had slipped in whisky markets, hit not least by two brands outwith its
umbrella, Bells and the Famous Grouse.
Connell was the classic type of Distillers man, joining the company in 1946,
after Stowe and Oxford, and throwing coal on the fire at the Tanqueray gin
subsidiary, where his father was managing director. From there he climbed the
ladder, sober-suited, unassuming and with an allegedly steely edge.
But somebody needed to prod the giant into life, they said, though who could
possibly buy over Scotland's largest company?
James Gulliver decided to try. He showed his hand in September 1985 but was
hindered by the Takeover Panel from making his bid for three months. Distillers
prepared its defence. The American Bill Spengler was drafted in as deputy
chairman to add strength to the board and Sir Nigel Broackes, chairman of
Trafalgar House, was also brought to the board.
Guinness got wind of events and eyed that glorious portfolio of 60 Distillers'
whiskies, ranging from Johnnie Walker to Haig's, as well as Gordon's and
Booth's gin and the popular Pimms. But they had just taken over Bell's of Perth
and Ernest Saunders said he didn't relish another bruising battle.
From many sides, however, he was being counselled to think about it. The head
of the Guinness family, Lord Iveagh, for example, was feeling it was time they
were restored on the perch alongside the Rothschilds and people of such ilk.
Gulliver made his opening bid of #1864m on December 2, 1985, backed by the
Royal Bank of Scotland - for 100 years bankers to Distillers, who promptly
sacked them. John Connell told Distillers' 104,000 shareholders they were
fighting the bid. If there was to be a buyer at all they clearly preferred
Guinness, who then joined battle with Gulliver.
As that battle raged, Argyll announced they were suing both Distillers and
Guinness over their agreement that the latter's costs in the bid would be borne
by the Scots company. Argyll upped its bid and so did Guinness, the latter
saying they would bring their headquarters to Scotland and appoint as their
chairman Sir Thomas Risk, Governor of the Bank of Scotland.
On April 18, 1986, Guinness won the battle at #2.6bn and James Gulliver's
Argyll bowed out gracefully, selling its holding in Distillers at a profit of
#140m, which did not however cover the cost of their bid.
The battle had been long, bloody and expensive and, for the directors of
Distillers, a pretty humiliating end to a decade of decline.
Within months Guinness stirred anger by reneging on its undertaking to move HQ
to Scotland - and Sir Thomas Risk did not become chairman. Instead, Ernest
Saunders took over the role.
That seemed to be that, until the autumn of 1986 brought the first whiff of
scandal. The high-profiled Wall Street trader Ivan Boesky revealed he had
helped support the Guinness share-price during the takeover, improving its
chances of success. In return, Guinness had been investing in Boesky's business.
All hell was about to break loose, involving the Serious Fraud Office.
Executive chairman Saunders faced charges of theft, false accounting and
conspiracy, the main thrust of the trial being that he and others engaged in a
multi-million-pound support of Guinness shares so that they would look the more
attractive proposition to the shareholders of Distillers.
It was a major business drama, fascinating in its detail if sometimes a
bewilderment to those outwith the world of wheeling and dealing. After six
months of evidence and five days of jury consideration, estimated at #25m plus
investigative costs, four defendants were found guilty.
Ernest Saunders was sentenced to five years, which was halved on appeal.
Property-to-petrol tycoon Gerald Ronson, of the Heron Group, was sent to prison
for a year and fined a record #5m. Stockbroker Anthony Parnes was given a
two-and-a-half year sentence while financier Jack Lyons was fined #3m and
stripped of his knighthood, having escaped jail because of age and ill-health.
Other parts of the case either collapsed or didn't reach court and there were
allegations that the Establishment was looking after its own.
The subsequent story was that Saunders gained release after 10 months, said to
be suffering from a pre-senile dementia akin to Alzheimer's. He has since been
acting as a business consultant and has lectured on the problems facing
businessmen whose conduct comes under question. More recently he has been
enjoying a skiing holiday in Austria. Gerald Ronson served six months of his
sentence and returned to the helm of a Heron company which was suffering
financial problems.
Anthony Parnes was released after 11 months but faced difficulty in finding a
way back to the City, when he was refused a licence to engage in any
stockbroking work.
The ailing Jack Lyons retired from his business career and went to live in
Switzerland.
And what became of the directors who led the Distillers company before it was
taken over?
Chairman John Connell retired to Surrey. His brother David, who had been
managing director of Johnnie Walker, stayed on with the new owners for a time,
became chairman of the Scotch Whisky Association but has since retired to
Surrey, where he pursues his hobby of bird-watching.
Ronnie Martin, who was Distillers' whisky production director, is the only
other member of the board still active in business. He, too, stayed on with
Guinness but retired at 60 in 1991. He then went into business with son Hamish
and runs a drinks company called Inverarity Vaults in Edinburgh. He is also
Visiting Professor of Distilling at Heriot Watt University.
Of the others, Bill Spengler went back to America; David Kerr is secretary of
the Hurlingham Tennis Club; Lord Maclean and Cary Younghusband are dead and
retirement became the option of: finance director Robert Temple, Sir William
Pile (former chairman of the Inland Revenue), company secretary William Elgood,
Peter Whitley, personnel boss William Forrest, John Holbech and David Small,
who was managing director of Dewar's.
In the aftermath of all that, Guinness suffered a tarnished image but managed
to salvage the situation by appointing as chairman the highly-regarded Scots
businessman Sir Norman Macfarlane, later to become Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden.
He in turn brought in another able Scot, Anthony Tennant, as managing director
and the end result of the whole messy business is that the revamped Guinness
has made a notable success of the old Scottish company, now known as United
Distillers.
Looking reflectively from his Edinburgh pad, James Gulliver acknowledges that
success and tells me: ``What Anthony Tennant did was precisely what we were
intending to do.''
Deprived of the opportunity, however, he merely shrugs and moves on to another
phase of an eventful life.

Nairobi, Monday
A SCOTS diplomat shot by thugs in Nairobi last week was in serious condition in
hospital tonight, the British High Commission in Nairobi said.
Mr Graeme Gibson, a second secretary, was admitted to the private Nairobi
Hospital after he was shot in the neck while driving to his home in a suburb of
the capital on Friday night.
Three men in a stolen car trailed him and fired at him after failing to force
him to stop.
Mr Gibson lost control of his four-wheel-drive car - favoured by expatriates in
Kenya and a major target of robbers - and crashed into a gate.
The thieves' car was later involved in a collision, but they escaped after
hijacking another car, police said.
``He is in a serious but stable condition. At the moment he is paralysed,'' a
High Commission spokeswoman said of Mr Gibson. She declined to give any further
details.
Attacks on diplomats have increased sharply in the past year and Kenyan
President Daniel arap Moi last month urged police to move to stem the tide.
Last week heads of the diplomatic corps met Kenyan foreign minister Kalonzo
Musyoka to press their case for improved security.
The minister told parliament last week that diplomats were not ``specifically
targeted'' by thugs but were, like ordinary Kenyans, victims of rising crime in
the East African country.
But he pledged better security for diplomats.-Reuter.

Moscow, Monday
RUSSIA'S President Boris Yeltsin left hospital for a sanatorium today after a
month of treatment for a heart complaint, but may be unable to play an active
role in the country's election campaign.
Spokesman Sergei Medvedev refused to be drawn on whether Yeltsin, now under
medical supervision at Barvikha sanatorium, would be fit to take an active part
in the run-up to the December 17 parliamentary election.
``The president will be staying at Barvikha until he is completely well,'' he
said.
Asked if Mr Yeltsin would be in the sanatorium on polling day, Medvedev said:
``That's a question you have to ask the doctors.''
But Itar-Tass news agency said treatment at Barvikha, hidden in woodland some
15 miles to the west of Moscow, could last up to a month.
``If you consider that this time the doctors are insisting on Boris Yeltsin
undergoing a full course of treatment, you can assume that the head of state
will return to his Kremlin office around the end of December,'' Tass said.
Mr Yeltsin was rushed to hospital on October 26 after his     second heart
attack in less than four months.-Reuter.

MERRYDOWN is as happy as a puppy with two tails - which is not difficult given
the outstanding success of the Two Dogs alcoholic lemonade, writes ANDREW
WILSON.
That is the new drinks sub-sector which has taken Britain by storm and its
market penetration has been such that in three months since its launch in July,
Two Dogs was responsible for perhaps half the improvement in Merrydown's
half-time profits advance from #340,000 to #1.16m.
In the last few weeks, growth has predictably slowed because of the cooler
weather but Christmas could well be a new opportunity.
Sensibly, Merrydown abandoned the making of low margin own label cider for the
supermarkets to create capacity for its new product. That does not prevent an
increase in overall cider volumes although chairman Richard Purdey was
reluctant to give volume figures yesterday, claiming that it would be
commercially disadavantageous.
The cider industry is now dominated as to about 90% by HP Bulmer and Matthew
Clark after the acquisition of Taunton Cider. That should provide opportunities
for the smaller players with some retailers not wishing to become overly
dependent on what is almost a duopoly of supply.
Merrydown is in the fortunate position of now having its Original Cider
distributed by Whitbread through its managed outlets and that has made good
progress despite no promotion as yet.
Analysts are looking for a massive swinground in profitability from a #2.70m
loss into a pre-tax profit of about #2m. That would leave the shares trading at
about 10 times earnings which may be a slight undervaluation.
The interim dividend has been doubled to 2p so that a full-year total of 4p for
a 3.9% yield is on the cards. Dividend cover will remain high to      help
build up balance sheet strength.

Everybody needs good neighbours, but what happens when neighbours become
authors in their own right? Then, finds Julia Langdon, you start to ask pointed
questions after seeing familiar faces peering out from the pages of the novel
ANTONIA Swinson is one of those infuriating people who has had about six
careers before the age of 40. She lived in Italy and taught English to some
distinguished Italians so that she could learn their language and be a singer.
She was a successful actress in Scotland in her twenties. She had a spell doing
very profitable voice-overs for children's products. She was a Fleet Street
journalist, a television critic, a woman's page journalist and then a business
writer.
In the last couple of years, while working for the charity Common Purpose, and
being a freelance singer and doing the odd bit of journalism, and still finding
time to deliver the parish magazine, she has also been raising two small
children and writing a novel. And she never looks other than beautifully
turned-out - not even when she's putting the rubbish out at dawn on Mondays.
She is one of that sort; the ones who make you grit your teeth with irritation
when you read about them. Unless, that is, you know them.
And as it happens I know Antonia Swinson and the backcloth of her novel rather
well, including the day on which her dustman comes to call, because not only
was she until recently a neighbour of mine but she has written a book which is,
at least loosely, all about our street. According to one of the reviews, she
has made ``a landscape of characters who might have been types or cliches into
real people''. Wrong. It is entirely the other way around.
``Well, yes, there is a woman journalist in it,'' she said, when we went to the
caff round the corner to talk about it, ``but honestly, Julia, it's not you.''
There are, however, a couple of actors to be found in the plot and, yes, we
have a couple of them on our block. And we have the famous television
script-writer - he's just opposite, goes to the pub, keeps himself to himself,
you know. And yes, we can also boast what she calls the ``less successful
architects'' - unfortunate professional victims of the recession - and we have
a tree surgeon as well. What's this, on page 97, but a tree surgeon? Now not
every street has its own tree surgeon.
Then there is the desperately snobbish character who notices whether people
have unlined curtains - now who could that be? ``I can hear myself in half a
dozen places,'' one of the neighbours hissed. These are dangerous grounds,
Antonia, on to which you have dared to tiptoe.
She obviously has a relatively clear conscience because she did ask half the
neighbourhood to the launch party. But what about the other half? Were they
invited? Or were they enraged? And there is also the fact that she has now
high-tailed it back to Scotland, out of reach of the tittle-tattle. Could it be
that she is anxious about something? She did have it read for libel now, didn't
she?
She laughs off the back-biting and the bitching. ``There are no neighbours in
the book,'' she insists. ``I have met lots of people who are writers and
gallery owners and they are the sort of people I've written about. It's really
not based on anyone in particular.'' But who is Georgiana, she of the ruched
curtains? And what's all this about loft conversions? She won't say another
word about it. Everyone has a couple of snobby women and, really, she wouldn't
want to offend anyone. She is really very fond of the folk on our block.
Her refusal to be more specific is altogether regrettable. There is high drama
in our street; love and death, laughter and loathing, and just who was it who
dragged those bin bags down the street and left them outside Number 1? If,
however, I set down another word it will be I who gets the lawyers' letters -
or even, perhaps, the bin bags.
The book is set in six weeks in 1990 and is about the life and love of a widow
- in West London, yes, because that is what she knows - and about the
recession. We all know about that, too. At the time she wrote it, Antonia was
nursing her second baby, who was clingy and wouldn't let her out of the room,
and after the years in newspaper offices she felt distinctly isolated. ``The
more grim life became, the funnier the book became.''
She has a considerable literary inheritance. Her father, Arthur Swinson, who
died in 1970, wrote the first few series of Dr Finlay's Casebook. He was a
playwright and a military historian and the author of Scotch on the Rocks, the
story of the S.S. Politician, immortalised by Compton Mackenzie in Whisky
Galore. His daughter went to Edinburgh University in 1976, read English,
Italian and Scottish history - and fell in love with a Scotsman.
This is her husband, Alan Reid, from Ayr, who brought the family back to
Scotland this summer. ``I think I knew we would always come back here,'' she
says. She has a great affection for Scotland after her acting experiences -
even though as Cinderella at the Glasgow Pavilion she got chilblains from the
Glasgow winter and Dandini had the devil's own job pushing the slipper on.
She had learned to tap-dance in her last term at university and got her first
acting job at #75 per week in panto at the King's Theatre, Edinburgh. She was
in Babes in the Wood with Jack Milroy and Rikki Fulton and then landed a part
as a receptionist in the Auchtarn Hotel in STV's High Road. Then it was
Cinderella, with Sydney Devine as Buttons, and lots of glamorous pictures in
the newspapers. She loved it. The fact that she hadn't been to drama school
didn't bother her in the slightest. She had the confidence of youth, an Equity
card and recognition in the streets.
Fifteen years later and she is now in North Berwick, has bought a balaclava to
walk the kids to school and is loving it. And a little note for readers in
North Berwick. She is hard at work on the second novel . . . and this time it's
set in Scotland.

David Belcher recounts those far-off days when country huts gave Glasgow's
tenement-dwellers the freedom to become someone else
THESE days you can't employ the phrase ``a house in the country'' without
hearing Blur's sneering dismissal of acquisitive homesteaders. Similarly, the
Ramblers' Association is no longer headed by lumpy proles in anoraks and woolly
hiking socks. Instead, it's overseen by Janet Street-Porter, a high-profile
metropolitan media panjandrum with a penchant for expensive Gore-tex
leisurewear.
Yet it all used to be so different back in those far-off days of working-class
solidarity . . . a time when the socialist hutters roamed certain hillsides in
the West of Scotland.
As a forthcoming edition of BBC Scotland's Ex-S documentary series will shortly
reveal, every weekend and for an annual summertime fortnight the hutters would
exchange Glasgow's teeming tenements for their own hand-built wooden refuges,
60ft square, in a two-acre field gifted them by a patrician mansion owner in
rural Carbeth, near Milngavie.
Shoulder to shoulder they advanced in search of fresh air, self-improvement,
and comradeship as proletarian foot soldiers of the Fellowship Camping
Association, an organisation which had its roots in such long-lost causes as
the Socialist Sunday School, the Clarion Scouts, and the Esperanto Club.
Kate Barclay is among the indomitable old-time hutters whose memories form the
bittersweet core of When Summers Were Longer, made for Ex-S under the direction
of Don Coutts by Move On Up, the Cromarty-based independent film company.
``The Clarion Scouts began in the Depression with the motto Bread and Roses,''
Kate recalls. ``They believed that simply providing the unemployed with food
wasn't enough; folk needed beauty in their lives too.''
In consequence, Clarion Scout activities included organising cycle clubs, drama
groups, an art section, and talks from botanists. Ironically, the beginning of
the end came when working-class horizons began to be widened by a greater
measure of personal wealth: although most of the Carbeth huts are still in use,
the FCA disbanded at the end of the sixties when ordinary folk began to acquire
cars.
Recently, a reluctant Kate sold her Carbeth hut to a couple of hillwalkers too
young to recall rambling's birth as a defiant act of mass trespass by the
underclasses; a means of demonstrating their opposition to the land-owning
capitalist oppressors who preferred to keep the oiks fenced out.
Bob Starrett, a veteran of the UCS shipyard sit-in who now paints film and TV
backdrops for a living, provides the programme's political background, having
acquired in his youth an extensive education - ``in all the -isms, from Marxism
to vegetarianism'' - from numerous Clydeside campfire philosophers.
``As a city kid in Stratford Street, Maryhill, we used to watch out for this
legendary joiner in the next street, a guy who used to disappear into a
mystical land every weekend, somewhere called The Country, and when he was out
there, he found the freedom to become someone else. We eventually got to know
someone who had a hut at Carbeth and we, too, went out there on Fridays, taking
a tram to Milngavie and then walking for miles.
``Carbeth was a focus for ex-Servicemen who had come home from the war and were
unable to face the nine-to-five routine, long before hippies were thought of.
They weren't malcontents . . . it was more that they were looking for an
alternative way of life. There was an esprit de corps, a camaraderie . . . it
sounds old, an anachronism now.''
Certainly it's hard to view some of the original 8mm home-movie footage of
Carbeth featured in When Summers Were Longer without tearful regret for a time
when hope seemed universal; when socialist idealism was in the ascendency.
Monochrome depictions of sun-dappled Austin A35s; proud mums in pinnies;
innocent teens twisting al fresco; weans tumbling their wilkies on the
greensward.
Yet the overwhelming mood of the Carbeth veterans, filmed for When Summers Were
Longer at a hutters' reunion, is a joyous one. Hutters look back with
amusement, not regret, recalling such sights as the Drumchapel Outbacker, an
intrepid explorer whose weekends were spent beneath the brim of a ridiculous
hat with corks dangling from it. Hugh Healy, poet and communist, meanwhile,
prefers to look forward to the English accents of his grandweans echoing round
Carbeth.
Maybe the huts provide a fitting metaphor for the spirit of their weekend
dwellers. Some of the huts are fashioned out of redundant boarding obtained
from Clydebank Co-Operative garage. Many of them have walls that are out of
true - a statement which could never be applied to the Carbeth fresh-air
pioneers.
n When Summers Were Longer can be seen on BBC1 next Monday at 10.25pm.

Kate Rafferty finds a festive package in Ayr which will take the strain out of
shopping around
SHOPPING should be part of the excitement in the run up to Christmas, but all
too often it becomes nothing more than a series of bad-tempered expeditions
where traffic congestion, parking problems, crowds and not knowing where to get
a decent cup of coffee are all unwelcome early presents.
There is a town, which can be reached in less than an hour from Glasgow, which
offers the full range of national retailers as well as many interesting local
shops.
These are just two reasons why Christmas shopping in Ayr makes sense.
Getting there couldn't be easier. For those not travelling by car, the train
station is five minutes walk from the High Street and is served by a
half-hourly service from Glasgow Central. There is also a large bus network
serving the town.
The majority of shoppers will probably arrive by car, however, and they are
more than adequately served with a large choice of on and off-street parking.
The roads into Ayr have signs directing motorists to the car park which suits,
whether it be long or short stay.
Town centre manager Sunil Varu is also pleased at the refurbishment of the
multi-storey car park which is close to the main shopping areas. ``The
multi-storey has been totally upgraded, with about #500,000 spent on it. It now
has extra lighting and closed circuit television, as well as being repainted,
making it much fresher-looking. We've removed what were the perceived problems
so I hope people will consider using it.''
Once the car is parked, Ayr has an added bonus. It is such a self-contained
town centre that shoppers won't have to walk far to enjoy the full range of
shops, entertainments and restaurants.
What Ayr Town Centre Management believes the town offers is a complete package,
a ``quality shopping experience'' and they have produced three comprehensive
guides which help take the hassle out of this time of year, putting some
enjoyment back into gift buying.
One of the guides concentrates on where to park in Ayr. An easy-to-follow map
details where each car park is situated, whether it's long or short stay, and
if there's a charge, how much it will cost.
Another guide tells weary shoppers where they can rest their feet and get some
refreshment. Every eating and drinking establishment is detailed and separated
by category, so whether it's just a quick coffee (or a quick something
stronger), a take-away sandwich or a full meal (the best in Scottish and
international cooking is on offer), a glance at the guide will point you in the
right direction.
Perhaps even handier than this, is the guide to shopping which includes every
shop in the centre. Again the shops are listed by category and it includes
addresses and telephone numbers.
The alphabetical categories run from Art/Picture Framers through to Wine
Merchants. Symbols next to certain shops show whether it offers facilities
which are essential to some, such as mother and baby rooms or automatic door
access.
Each of these pocket-sized guides can be collected from the town's tourist
board or shops throughout the centre.
The town centre management team are constantly researching new ways to help
those who choose to shop in Ayr. Another initiative is launched on December 7.
``We're launching our Shopmobility scheme that day,'' said Sunil Varu. ``This
will allow physically disabled people to park their cars, borrow or hire a
motorised wheelchair or scooter, and do their shopping more independently and
in comfort.''
The range of initiatives by the management team has brought three prestigious
awards to the town, two of which have never been awarded to a Scottish town or
city before.
``These awards are run by various organisations and magazines,'' said Mr Varu.
``The first was a street design competition in which Ayr received a
commendation.
``The second was an award which recognised traffic calming measures, put in
place to reduce road accidents. This was in conjunction with the improvement of
the aesthetic environment of the town The third, which we only received quite
recently, came from the British Council of Shopping Centres. Again it's the
first time the award, which we shared with Hemel Hempstead, has come to
Scotland.''
The final award, said Mr Varu, ``recognises what a lot of organisations locally
have been striving for''. It is given to the town which is judged to have put a
clear strategy for town centre improvement into practice, raising the quality
of not only the provision of shops but of amenities such as parking,
environment, pedestrianisation and closed circuit television (which Ayr has had
in operation for four months).

SLAUGHTERHOUSE operators, already chafing at the cost of implementing anti-BSE
measures, may face a further tightening of regulations, UK Agriculture Minister
Douglas Hogg warned yesterday.
Speaking at the Smithfield FarmTech event, the Minister said it was vital that
the regulations were applied 100% and he admitted that since the summer 17
breaches had been detected.
He ruled out, however, the possibility of the Government putting extra funds
into the industry to cover additional costs.
Mr Hogg said he deplored the damage which had been done to the beef industry's
standing in the eyes of the public by the dispute over who should share the
cost of disposing of specified bovine offal (SBO).
Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales,
joined the Minister in attacking the public bickering between auctioneers and
meat company operators over the meat companies' attempts to impose a #3.50 a
head levy to cover their SBO costs.
In Scotland, at least, the auctioneers, the meat plant operators and the NFUS
have been able to find common ground.
In a statement yesterday they announced the formation of a working party which
has been charged with devising an all-industry approach to the problems of BSE
and the disposal of SBOs.
It is hoped that the working party will report by mid-January. In the meantime
the meat operators have agreed to withdraw their demand that farmers should
meet half the costs of implementing the SBO measures by paying a levy on each
animal sold at auction.
The announcement of a resumption of trading ``on normal terms'' ends the fear
that markets could be hit by an expansion of direct procurement from farm to
slaughterhouse.
The Scots have made more progress than their counterparts in England. The Meat
and Livestock Commission intends to convene a joint meeting south of the Border
but no date has yet been agreed.
The name-calling in England has been more bitter and the NFU has complained to
the Office of Fair Trading about meat traders acting ``in concert'' to force
auctioneers to accept the levy.
Ian Gardiner, the English NFU policy director, claimed yesterday that farmers
had already absorbed a lot of costs associated with BSE eradication - about #7
an animal. They could not understand why the slaughterhouses felt justified in
seeking a further contribution from them.
Abattoirs could recover their costs in two ways - partly through prices for
meat and partly by a slimming process with one or two operators closing down,
he suggested. The abattoir industry had clearly been under stress before the
SBO arrangements came in.
Farmers attending a discussion forum at Smithfield warned the Agriculture
Minister that fears over BSE could destroy the beef industry. They called for
the Ministry of Agriculture to make greater efforts to reassure the public.
Mr Hogg said that the scientific evidence was positively reassuring that BSE
could not be transmitted to humans and that Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease - which
has been described as the human equivalent - was not contracted by eating beef.
``We do not believe that there is a link between the two diseases,'' he said.
Control measures were aimed at preventing any SBO material from getting into
the food chain - either human or animal.

SCOTLAND yet again reigned supreme in the cattle ring at Smithfield with the
overall award going to Donald Bhan, a December 1994 cross Charolais steer from
Ewen MacPherson and Sons, Mill Farm, Oban.
This steer, which weighed 543kg with a daily live weight gain of 1.51kg, was
bred by the MacPhersons and was sired by the 18,000gns bull Simpson's Gregg
which is shared with the MacGregors of Allanfauld, Kilsyth. It is out of a
Charolais cross cow.
For the MacPhersons, father Ewen and sons Donald and Ewen, it was a second
Smithfield triumph, repeating the feat they achieved back in 1989 with The
Bandit.
However, for Donald MacPherson this win was even sweeter. He said: ``It seemed
harder this time and also very nerve-wracking. But I suppose the fact that we
bred this one is especially satisfying.'' Indeed it was, with the MacPhersons
taking the King's Cup for the best beast bred by an exhibitor.
Standing reserve overall was the July 1994 Limousin cross steer Dark Destroyer
from John Yates, Moscow Farm, Derby. This steer weighed 487kg with a daily gain
of 0.98kg.
Commenting on the championship, the judge, John Dawkins, said: ``It was not an
easy job, but today we have seen what is indisputably the best beef in the
world - British beef.
The top two animals have meat in the right place over the loins, rump and
second thigh with no waste. They are near perfection.''
There was also a strong Scottish element in the other championship awards with
the junior heifer title going to Rae Grieve, Carhurlie, Lundin Links, Fife,
with his Winter Fair reserve, the Limousin Peekaboo.
Allan MacGregor, The Binn, Glenfarg, took the junior heifer title, while Tom
and Gavin Scott, Gateside, Linlithgow, won the senior heifer section with Lady
Barbara.
But the overall heifer championship went to a pure Charolais from Mervyn and
Chris Parker, Grange, Duxford, Cambridge.
The heavyweight steer championship was another Scottish triumph with Scott
Watson, Balhousie, Carnoustie, winning with his Limousin cross Angus,
No-Kan-Do, ahead of yet another Limousin cross from the MacPhersons - OJ
Simpson.
The sheep championship went to a pair of pure bred Suffolk ewe lambs from Jack
Bulmer, Great Habton, Malton, York.
This was Mr Bulmer's sixth supreme title and, he said, ``definitely the very
last''.
These winners had Scottish blood behind them too as they were sired by
Lauderdale Lovejoy, which was purchased for 4000gns from James Dun, Colmslie,
Galashiels. The champion sold for #270 to Brian Glaves, a retail butcher from
Brompton in Yorkshire.
The reserve pair of sheep were Beltex ewe lambs from David Gardiner, Knowle
Farm, Derby.
The sheep judge, Allen Eastwood, was much impressed with the overall quality,
commenting: ``The Suffolks had that bit of extra length, but all the champions
were in line with consumer demand and would sell in any market.''

Tokyo, Monday
FEARS that western Japan could soon be crawling with deadly spiders prompted
stock market punters to pounce on insecticide shares today.
Demand was so overwhelming for aptly-named Fumakilla Ltd shares that they
failed to trade in the morning.
But in the afternoon some willing sellers crept out, orders were matched, and
the shares initially surged more than 11%.
The redback spider, native to Australia, has started appearing in Japan's
second city, Osaka.
Local media have quoted health ministry officials as saying that the red-back
spider's bite is fatal in 3!s% of cases, although it has yet to strike in
Japan.-Reuter.

SHARES of Spring Ram, the kitchens, bathrooms and furniture group, fell 7p to a
new 1995 closing low of 17p after hitting 15p, as the company warned of
continuing deteriorating trading conditions and said its second-half
performance was likely to be well below market expectations, writes CHRIS STONE.
These had already been badly dented in August when it reported an unexpected
drop in operating profits from #2.2m to #1.5m, while exceptional charges of
#16.7m took the pre-tax loss to #17.3m.
Yesterday the company said that trading conditions in the third quarter
remained extremely difficult in the building materials sector. ``Each of the
group's divisions experienced a further deterioration in trading conditions,
albeit that export sales have moved ahead as planned,'' said the firm.
A significant loss before tax had been incurred during the four months to the
end of October and it was not expecting the situation to improve before the end
of the year. Restructuring to improve costs and cash generation is being
undertaken, but tough market conditions are thought unlikely to improve in the
foreseeable future.

CONSTRUCTION group Tarmac heads up a consortium that has won a contract for the
#90m redevelopment of the Princess Margaret Hospital in Swindon. The project is
the largest so far under the Government's Private Finance Initiative.
The Swindon and Marlborough NHS Trust is expected to gain Government approval
for the plans in spring 1996, which should allow building to start early next
summer.
Financial support for the project is expected from among others The Royal Bank
of Scotland.
New owner
CLUB 18-30 and Sunset Holidays have a new owner, Flying Colours Leisure Group.
The acquisition vehicle has been put together in a #40m deal masterminded by
NatWest Ventures. In addition, Flying Colours has introduced a new product,
Priority Holidays, offering package holidays for those seeking a ``child free''
environment.
Sale confirmed
THE sale of the Olympus sports shops for #15m to former Amber Day head Philip
Green and Scottish sports retailer Tom Hunter, announced over the weekend, was
confirmed yesterday. They will be taking control of 123 retail outlets, 53
in-store concessions and 22 out-of-town stores. Sears' sale of the loss-making
chain will generate #25m in cash flow but there will be a loss on disposal of
#35m.
Roles split
GKN is to split the roles of chairman and chief executive next year in advance
of the scaling back of the duties of the present incumbent of both posts, Sir
David Lees. Aberdeen-born Sir David will reach 60 years of age by December next
year and will become non-executive chairman for three years from the beginning
of 1997.
Internet phone
FIRECREST, whose interests span marketing, publishing and the Internet, has
developed a telephone hand-set for use on the Internet and that will perform as
a normal telephone when connected directly into a computer.
Brunel departure
FINANCE director Alun Hicks has left Brunel Holdings, the construction
equipment and engineering group based at Chippenham, Wiltshire, by mutual
consent.

<HEADLINE>Vatican hits back at critics over Irish divorce poll</HEADLINE>

THE Vatican today said the legalisation of divorce in Roman Catholic Ireland
was not a defeat for the Church but rather one for family and society.
``The result of the referendum.......is not a `defeat' for the Church, as has
been said emphatically,'' the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano said.
``Logic and conscience say it is a defeat for the family, which loses one of
its constructive values - the unity and indissolubility of marriage,'' the
newspaper said.
The end of a 58-year-old ban on divorce in Ireland by a fistful of votes was
the second international public disappointment for Pope John Paul in a week.
The weekend vote came less than a week after the defeat of devoutly Roman
Catholic Lech Walesa at the hands of former communist Aleksander Kwasniewski in
the Polish presidential elections.
Two of Italy's leading newspapers - Milan's Corriere della Sera and La Stampa
of Turin - today ran front-page editorials saying the two cases pointed to the
Church's waning influence over increasing materialistic European societies.
``It is difficult for the Holy See to swallow two sensational international
knockouts in only seven days,'' the Rome newspaper La Republica said yesterday.
L'Osservatore, in a comment from Dublin, said divorce was merely a ``perverse
mechanism against the family'' that only gendered more divorce.
``Because the stability, the well-being and the harmony of society is based on
the unity and harmony of the family, when it breaks down or is threatened,
those who suffer the most are the children,'' the Vatican newspaper said.
As result, the newspaper argued, all of society suffered, adding that the rise
in petty crime could be traced to the breakdown of the family.
The report from Dublin ended with a challenge: ``Does a secular and consumer
society have the courage to ask itself questions about these values?''
In Ireland, the closest result in the country's electoral history came only
four days after the Pope intervened in the campaign by urging the Irish ``to
reflect on the importance for society of the indissoluble character of the
marriage bond''.
Ireland was a softer blow for the Vatican than Poland because of the slim
margin by which the divorce referendum won. But the defeats came in countries
where the sway the Church held over its faithful was once unquestioned.
Sources have said the Church may have to rethink its methods of appealing to
the people and of trying to exercise political influence in Roman Catholic
countries.
``Ireland and Poland were two cases which showed the evolution of a certain
type of culture into smaller societies that were once closed and have simply
caught up with the rest of Europe,'' one Church source said.
``In a sense both results are anti-Pope and anti-Church because, if he and the
Church identifed with a certain way of thinking, the results showed that this
way of thinking is losing out,'' the source said.
In both cases, Church sources say, some people may have voted the way they did
deliberately to spite the Church because they felt its influence over daily
life was excessive.
The Irish result came on the heels of a poll taken for a conference of Italy's
Church hierarchy. It showed that many Italians considered littering a more
serious sin than adultery, homosexual activity or premarital sex.-Reuter.

A HUGE barn of a place, the SECC. Normally, you'd expect some variety among an
audience of this size, a few kooky cats with crazy clothes, hairstyles or
behaviour; the loose threads of life's variegated tapestry.
But a Wet Wet Wet concert is different. The audience are uniform in their
ordinariness. Quite disconcerting.
Still, our expectations were high. What bounty of surprises would the Wetties
have in store? Curtain-up and all was revealed: a stage set filched from a
Saturday-night TV variety show special, circa 1975. All stairs laced with
beaded lights, fireworks, and kitsch ostentation. Beautiful.
And there was Marti, resplendent in a black glittery jacket, Tony Blair smile
turned on full beam, launching into hit after hit after hit.
Wishing I Was Lucky, Goodnight Girl, Angel Eyes, even Love Is All Around - they
were all there. Then, in Memphis tribute mode, the boys launched into an Elvis
medley. Surprisingly, when Marti loses the strange affectation that forces him
to use the full length and breadth of his vocal range on each and every word he
sings, Marti does a fair impression of the fat Pelvismeister. Unfortunately, he
can't dance for toffee. This is a man who has trouble walking in time.
In conclusion, the problem with Wet Wet Wet is that, like their name, their
success is premised on the repetition of a single idea.
A torpid haze soon descends, Morpheus opens his arms and you find yourself
falling, falling . . . Huge jets of flame, shooting up from stage-front
funnels, blast us back to consciousness. ``Anybody singe their pubic hair?''
cackles Marti. Top end-of-the-pier humour from a master.

Skye decimals
DESPITE my address I am actually from Skye and like Amelia Simonini I live at
an apparently unusual address when I return to Skye during the college holidays.
Several houses in Skye have addresses such as 3/4 of 2, !s of 3, etc. This
number refers to the share of the croft land and not the houses. Our house is
on !s a croft while our neighbour, several acres away, has the other  !s .
As for some of the Rev William Shackleton's other queries, Skye has just as
good a postal delivery service as many other parts of the country. And,
finally, 3/4 of 2 in decimals is 1.5.
