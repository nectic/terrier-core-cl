POTATO producers whose crops have begun to die back because of drought
conditions would be well advised to burn them off to avoid the
complications of secondary growth inspired by recent rainfall, Simon
Bowen of the Scottish Agricultural College crop systems department said
yesterday.
The change from drought conditions to heavy rainfall was unfortunate,
he said. A slow, steady drizzle would have been preferable and less
likely to promote secondary growth. ''The problems start when you go
from very, very dry to wet conditions.''
Crops which are burned off can be left in the ground to develop a skin
in preparation for harvesting.
Among the complications of secondary growth, which can have a major
effect on yields, is a tendency for tubers to crack open as the insides
begin to develop faster than the outsides. Shallower cracks occur in the
condition known as ''netting'' -- but this still detracts from the
crop's suitability for the packing market.
More difficult to detect is the ''glassy'' tuber where the production
of a second growth of young tubers can rob the existing potatoes of
starch. Glassy tubers will not go soft when boiled.
The Dutch crop was badly affected last year when growers had to soak
their harvested crops in brine so the lighter ''glassy'' tubers would
float to the top.
The full effects of the dry conditions will not be known until the
crop is harvested, but predictions of rising prices on the back of
supply shortages may be wide of the mark, according to the SAC's
September economic survey.
The latest Potato Marketing Board estimate of plantings indicates a
5000 hectare increase in plantings by registered producers in Britain,
the survey says.
Average yields of early crops lifted so far have been roughly two
tonnes a hectare ahead of 1994. Lower demand and a re-deployment of
labour to the grain harvest have led to a slow-down in the rate of
lifting and, therefore, a tightening of available supplies.
The consequential rise in prices has been read as indicative of things
to come and has possibly encouraged a further slow-down in lifting --
leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy.
These signals have resulted in dramatic price rises on the futures
market where the price quoted per tonne doubled between July and August,
reaching more than #260. The average ex-farm price paid last week was
#167.68 a tonne.
The SAC forecast is for a British crop which is down, but not by
nearly so much as some have suggested. Germany, Holland and France all
reported increased plantings and the south German crop is set to be
higher this year after a good growing season. Overall, a significantly
better Continental crop is expected.
The survey estimates the British crop at six million tonnes, compared
to 6.6 million last year, with reduced export opportunities leading to
increased supplies available for home use.
''Depending on when the 1996 crop comes on stream we are not
necessarily that far below a balanced market, particularly if continuing
high prices deter consumption,'' it says.

<HEADLINE>Alternative plan proposed to tackle SAP fraud claims</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Scottish Office has been asked to consider an alternative to their
current proposal for combatting the risk of fraudulent claims on the
Sheep Annual Premium Scheme by opting for a single retention period.
Spencer Hayes of quota brokers Hayes McCubbin Macfarlane described the
alternative plan as a ''brilliant suggestion'' by Aberdeenshire sheep
farmer Alan Ross of Wardhead, Strichen.
''Basically his idea is that we should retain two periods but limit
the first to mature ewes. The second period would be for ewe hoggs, most
of which would not qualify for payment until April anyway,'' he said.
The proposal to move to a single retention period is intended to
eliminate the possibility of the premium being paid twice on the same
animal -- a situation which could arise if a ewe was sold on after a
claim had already been made. Concerns had been expressed by EC auditors.
Spencer Hayes emphasised that the problem of fraud was theoretical.
''I think it is incredible to make these proposals on the whim of an
auditor,'' he said. ''It used to be that officials from the department
of agriculture went out and saw how things worked on the ground. Now it
has to make sense on paper.
''The Government is sacrificing a long-standing sheep husbandry
practice -- which has evolved over the years to serve the needs of the
consumer -- just because the Brussels auditors think there is a
theoretical risk of fraud,'' he said.
Mr Hayes pointed out that under European legislation the United
Kingdom was entitled to set two application periods for SAP, giving
producers a choice of retention period. There was an important principle
at stake, he said. ''We have had the two retention period for a long
time. Why should we give them up for a poor reason.''
The Government has also warned that it is planning to tighten up on
the maintenance of flock records. Farmers could lose all their SAP
payments if their flock records did give all the required information at
the time of inspection.
''So we will have these draconian controls -- and they still plan to
do away with the first retention period,'' said Mr Hayes.
It was scandalous that proposals had been announced in a consultation
paper before the breeding sales but a final decision would not be known
till the sales were over. Farmers would be attending the sales in a mood
of great uncertainty.
* KELSO ram sale, with 14 auctioneering firms operating out of 18
rings, takes place tomorrow at Springwood Park showground. More than
6700 rams have been entered, nearly 4000 of them from the Suffolk breed.

MAYBE, just maybe, we have a better Scotland team than most people
would believe. Because this morning the journeymen who make up the
better part of manager Craig Brown's squad have pushed this country into
the finals of the European Championship.
It is not certain yet that the Scots have qualified. There is still a
remote possibility that San Marino can come to Hampden and win, and that
Greece can go to Russia and do the same. But find a bookmaker who will
give you odds against Scotland being in the finals in England next
summer.
Throughout the qualifying games the Scots have been written off.
The players of Faroe Islands claimed that Scotland would not qualify.
The manager of Greece, after losing at Hampden last month, declared
that Craig Brown's players were lucky to be in a qualifying position.
This week, in the run-up to the match against Finland, it was the same
story. Once again the Scots were the whipping boys for the Finnish
manager, who complained about the lack of technique and the lack of
quality in the Scottish play.
He was given his answer after just 10 minutes last night, when Scott
Booth scored. Eventually that was to be the goal which meant so much to
Scotland.
It was out of the Ally McCoist handbook, with Booth returned to the
international stage after a near year-long absence and then scoring the
vital goal, just as the Ibrox hero had done three weeks ago.
McCoist did not start the game. He came on late in the second half and
could not produce the miracles Brown may have been looking for.
But by then the Scotland manager might have realised that miracles
were not necessary on this night when Hampden held 35,505 fans who were
willing their country to victory. For them it meant a return to a
national identity, a return to the glory days of the Tartan Army.
For the Scottish players it meant a resurgence of pride and the
knowledge that they will not be mere onlookers when they big games take
place in England next summer.
And for the SFA it means a #2m jackpot just for taking part in the
finals with even bigger money available if this team can do better.
It is easy to knock the men who have carried Scotland to the finals,
easy to criticise their efforts. But, perhaps, now is the time for the
journeymen, rather than the stars.
Scotland are not blessed with the men who made us almost great in past
years. There are no Denis Laws, no Jim Baxters, no Kenny Dalglishes.
Don't look for them, they do not exist.
The romance which surrounded the game has gone. Now we look for a team
which can scuffle their way towards some kind of success. That is what
we have got with this Scottish squad.
When you look around Europe there are not too many countries who show
the quality that we believe at times we should have.
Manager Craig Brown insisted from the beginning that he wanted to
build a group of players with a team spirit, a club spirit, and carry
that into the international arena.
There is no doubt that he has succeeded in doing that.
There were times last night when Scotland lived dangerously. Times,
too, when they did not produce the kind of football that the fans will
remember through the mists of memory.
But the team was functional, the team was effective, and the result
was right.
There have been too many times in the past when I have left Hampden
suffering defeat after a poetic performance from the Scottish side.
Maybe now there is cause to be pragmatic, to look for results ahead of
performance. To look for the players to produce victories, even if we
cannot produce memorable victories.
Throughout this campaign, Scotland have done just that.
Few of the games will remain lodged in the memories of the fans, but
we must remember that too many of our memories were tinged with the
sadness of defeat. Now there is victory and some degree of success.
What awaits is the big stage, the European Championship finals and
then the Scottish players can show us if indeed they are better than we
believe.
There were signs last night, despite the nervousness, that they can do
this.
Gary McAllister remained as influential as ever, Alan McLaren was able
to kill the threat from Jari Litmanen, and Tosh McKinlay remains one of
the discoveries which Craig Brown has made and can be proud of in his
time as Scotland manager.
The working clothes can now be discarded, the team can now attempt to
show us what they can do.
I believe it will be better than the scuffling progress they have made
since their impressive first match victory in Helsinki.
Now, they are there, they are through, and the Tartan Army can make
their plans for the invasion of England.
Braveheart!

Scotland 1, Finland 0
THE penultimate step on the road to England was scary. Scotland didn't
so much falter on the threshold of the European Championship finals as
stumble through the front door like some party gatecrasher who had
suddenly lost his nerve and co-ordination.
Their narrow win against Finland last night before 35,505 supporters
who had come expecting to witness a triumphant continuation of a match
which started remarkably well with a 2-0 win against the Finns in
Helsinki a year ago, means the quest for qualification will be completed
successfully, but satisfactorily? Hold it right there. Let's not get
carried away.
Despite the rare luxury of a quick goal when Scott Booth scored his
fourth in his eighth international match, Scotland failed miserably to
build on that and finished up hanging on grimly to their three points
and also their dream of playing in the finals. All they have to do now
is beat San Marino at Hampden in the middle of November and the Tartan
hordes can start plotting to swarm over the Wall.
Finland were not good, yet they were allowed to emerge from the
despair of their early setback and take control in the second half
during which Scotland were running around chasing balls which they had
given away far too easily. It was an alarming spectacle and desperate
stuff, especially towards the end when the Finns surged forward and
almost claimed their equaliser in the final minutes when Markku Kanerva
shot over.
Long before then the fans, who had tried to amuse themselves by
creating Mexican waves during long bouts of boredom, had become uneasy
and anxious. With Jari Litmanen finally leaving behind Alan McLaren,
Finland sensed the Scots had lost their concentration and they tried
hard to take advantage.
Better finishing would have given them hope, but the loss of three
more points means they are now out of the reckoning in Group 8. The
Scots share top place on 20 points with Russia, who have two more
matches, against the Finns and the Greeks, to play and they, too, seemed
to be suffering from nervous anxiety.
Russia were 2-1 down after 60 minutes in the Faroe Islands, but
rallied and won 5-2 illustrating the difference between them and us.
When they have to, they can lift the level of their play while Scotland
just seem to blunder on bereft of ideas and hoping their courage and
determination will see them through.
Flair and invention will be required in England and even though Brown
has to say performances will improve when all of his players are fit his
claims sound hollow. Scotland simply don't have the quality.
We have, in the words of Finland's manager Jukka Ikalainen, ''no
fantasy'' in our play. After having watched his mediocre team make life
difficult for Scotland, no-one could have presented a strong argument
against him even though Brown didn't care much for the questions about
his lot's failings.
''Yes, in an ideal world we would have liked to have seen the team
build on the start and be more adventurous, but we mustn't devalue the
Finns,'' he said. ''I have had to use 28 players in nine matches because
of injuries and there will be no apology from me.
''Also, we have lost only one goal in eight international matches, so
I am not going to sit here defending this team. I am suggesting that
when everyone is fit we will see an improvement and hopefully everyone
will be available for the finals.''
With Duncan Ferguson, a sharper Ally McCoist, who was a second-half
substitute for John Spencer last night, Paul McStay, and Andy Goram the
Scottish side will be better, but it will still be short on true skill
and there is nothing Brown can do about that as he readily admitted. He
can't find flair where there is none.
''However, we will be a coherent and figthing unit,'' he said. ''We
will be hard to beat and the knockers of Scottish football should look
at our small population and look also at what the under-21s are
achieving.''
The under-21s beat their Finnish counterparts 5-0 yesterday afternoon
at Broadwood, which makes one wonder if they should play in the finals
next summer instead of the older group, who have difficulty in taking
chances whenever they are created.
Ikalainen is correct; flair and invention are what we need and the
Finn pointed out: ''It is always easy to play against British teams
because they have no fantasy, they have been playing the same way for
100 years.''
He added that he hoped Scotland do well in England, but he probably
suspects otherwise. The Greeks, of course, still cling to the hope of
going through, but even their 4-0 win over San Marino last night leaves
them behind on 15 points after eight matches.
The crucial goal was scored in 10 minutes when Scotland took advantage
of an inability to clear properly, and when the ball carried to John
Collins he dropped a perfect delivery in the middle of the box for
Booth. The Aberdeen player rose above his markers and headed into the
net with the keeper, Kari Laukkanen, astounded that Booth had made
contact despite having been surrounded by defenders who were taller.
The Scots then enjoyed good possession, but they never really
threatened although that didn't stop both full backs, Kari Rissanen and
Kanerva, from abusing Spencer. The Finns were cautioned and rightly so.
Brown made changes as Finland became more positive, and as well as
removing Spencer the manager took off Booth and sent on Darren Jackson.
Just before the end Stewart McKimmie was withdrawn also and Billy
McKinlay took over, but it was too late for him to achieve anything and
the Scots held on.
Everything will be all right. They will beat San Marino in the final
game, won't they?

Scotland Under-21 5,
Finland Under-21 0
MAYBE you should read that scoreline again. It rolls off the tongue
splendidly, does it not?
Five goals against a team that had gone six games without defeat is
stirring enough, but in the process the lads not only virtually
guaranteed their place in the European Championship quarter-finals but
set a new record winning margin for any Scottish Under-21 team.
That seems a fair day's work for a side that had five changes from the
one that had trimmed the Greeks last time out. One of the alterations
brought in Kevin Harper, the Hibs striker, who was grateful enough to
pop a in a hat trick.
He might have scored a fourth if he had been able to nudge team-mate
Jim Hamilton off the ball late on, but in true Scottish style the Dens
Park man was having none of it and scored himself. The other scorer was
the man second only to Harper in a day of excellent performances, Gary
Locke of Hearts.
Tommy Craig, the man in charge of this squad which has now strung
together six winning games in succession (and that must be another
record), might have gone on talking all night had he not to leave
Broadwood Stadium for Hampden.
''I just feel lucky to be in charge of a squad like this,'' he said.
''They've gone and done us proud again. Right now this is a squad who
believe they can take on anybody at any time. We can guarantee a
performance, if not a victory.''
This one puts the young Scots top of Group 8 with a superior goal
difference to the Finns, and a draw in their last game against San
Marino at Firhill next month would be enough to see them through to the
last eight.
They will not pay much attention to thoughts of a draw against the
weakest team in the section, however, and once they have disposed of
them, the prospect of emulating the Under-21s of 1992, who reached the
semi-finals of this competition, will beckon.
By the end of a fascinating 90 minutes in Cumbernauld the Finnish
side, who had held high hopes of making it to the Olympic games through
this tournament, were in complete disarray. For 20 minutes they looked
classy, clever and strong, giving the impression that they were about to
deliver the kind of thrashing they themselves suffered in the end.
Much of the credit for that must go to the Scots' grit and
old-fashioned ability to hang on in there, but maybe even more should go
to Harper. It was his magnificent strike in 21 minutes which altered the
pattern, lifted his mates and brought the Finns back to reality.
That goal was protected until half-time, after which the superbly fit
home lads gradually overwhelmed the Finnish side, and once Harper had
had added his second and third it was no contest.
''Definitely one of the best days I have had yet,'' said master
Harper. ''I scored three in an East of Scotland reserve match once, but
you could say this was a bit different, scoring in my first start for
the Under-21s.'' In fact, it was only his second appearance in total at
this level, having been put on as a late substitute against Greece.
Even so, he was not prepared to rate his opening goal as his finest to
date. ''I think I have scored better than that.''
'That' was still worth seeing, as should be the ones that put it into
the shade. It came after a bout of head tennis, when the ball came in
and out of the Finnish penalty area at least three times before Jackie
McNamara intelligently nodded it over a defender to Harper, who, with
the ball dropping over his shoulder, met it on the drop and volleyed it
high into the net.
His second goal, 13 minutes after the break, was pretty decent, too.
Jamie Fullarton sent a fine pass to Neil McCann on the left and when his
cross came over Harper headed it down and saw it bounce up into the roof
of the net.
The third was also down to a Fullarton pass, this time a flick over a
defender to the striker, who calmly chipped it over the keeper.
Hamilton, who replaced Liddell in 62 minutes, made it four after he
and Harper chased a through ball from McCann, and Locke smacked in the
fifth when the referee allowed advantage after McNamara had been pulled
down inside the box.
The hero of the day, Harper, was replaced by Steve Crawford four
minutes from the end, perhaps to have him bathed and dried in good time
to meet the media gang.
Tommy Craig is much too articulate to say it, but one or two of his
predecessors might have used the phrase which sums up the day: The boy
done good.

REPUBLIC of Ireland manager Jack Charlton refused to write-off his
team's European Championship chances after a 3-1 defeat by Austria in
Vienna.
Peter Stoger struck a hat trick to plunge the Republic's chances of
qualifying for the finals deep into the melting pot, but Charlton said:
''There is still a hell of a lot of football to be played. We'll not
give it up -- certainly not.
''If we beat Latvia next month and Austria only draw with Portugal, we
are a point ahead of them again. Perhaps it will go right down to the
final whistle again.''
But if Charlton was not pleased, the same could not be said of Gary
Speed, who gave new Welsh manager Bobby Gould a winning start with the
only goal against Moldova.
''It was great to get the goal that gave Bobby a winning start,'' said
Speed. ''We needed a win, any win, but now we're on the first rung of
the ladder which is what we were looking for.''
Sweden, semi-finalists in the World Cup, failed to qualify for the
European finals in England when they were held to a goalless draw by
Switzerland.
Group 3 leaders Switzerland and second-placed Turkey look favourites
to qualify, leaving the Swedes in third place.
France went on a goal spree in Auxerre, romping to their biggest
winning margin with the 10-0 demolition of Azerbaijan in Group 1.
The French, who had managed only seven goals in their seven previous
qualifiers, penetrated Azerbaijan's defence almost at will to notch
their highest tally since an 8-0 defeat of Iceland 38 years ago.
If it was easy for France it was the opposite for Italy, who laboured
to a 1-0 win against Slovenia in Group 4. Fabrizio Ravanelli scored the
all-important goal after 13 minutes, leaving Italy second in the group,
on 16 points from seven matches behind Croatia's 19 points from eight.
Substitute Youri Mulder kept Holland's hopes of reaching the finals
alive with a late winner to seal a 1-0 win over Belarus in Group 5 game
in Rotterdam.
Only seven minutes remained when Mulder, who came on just after the
hour mark for Rene Eijkelkamp, slid the ball home after a long pass from
fellow substitute Orlando Trustfull.
* INTER-MILAN striker Marco Delvecchio became the first player in the
Italian Serie A to be suspended for faking a foul. The player has been
banned for one match for ''pretending to have been fouled while in an
opponent's penalty area'' during Inter's first match of the season .

England 0, Colombia 0
AN IMPRESSIVE 75 minutes from Paul Gascoigne, the great enigma,
provided England's coach Terry Venables with as much encouragement as
anything in last night's enjoyable friendly at Wembley.
There were boos as the Rangers man was substituted, along with Alan
Shearer and Jamie Redknapp 15 minutes from time, having looked the one
English player capable of matching Colombia's skill.
Gascoigne was the creator when Shearer hit the bar early on, and later
only the width of a post prevented him becoming the first Rangers player
to score for England.
Sadly, only 20,038 turned up, the second-lowest for a Wembley
international. There will be considerably more in attendance for the
European Championship finals next summer, by which time Venables must
hope that Shearer has rediscovered his scoring touch, and that Gascoigne
is fully fit.
Venables said of Gascoigne: ''I think he did very well and I was
pleased with him. The reason for the substitutions was just that I
wanted to get fresh legs on to see if we could win the game.''
Gascoigne, his new black rinse somehow defying the driving rain, was
also satisfied with his night's work. ''I thought I could have lasted 90
minutes but my best will come in a month or two,'' he said. ''We learnt
a little bit tonight from them about keeping the ball, but you need an
end product as well.''
The expected pattern was set after seven minutes when Colombia, after
some inspired inter-passing and dribbling, were suddenly opened up by
one pass from Gascoigne, lofted into Shearer's path. The Blackburn
striker's lob left keeper Rene Higuita stranded, but bounced back off
the bar.
Twenty minutes later Gascoigne himself struck wood, sending a low
left-foot drive against a post after Shearer headed down Barmby's cross.
The unpredictable Higuita had the crowd gasping with his bizarre
acrobatics. He cleared a Redknapp shot by diving forward underneath the
ball and flipping both feet behind him to back-heel it away. Presumably
he had seen that the linesman's flag was up for offside.
He was left flat-footed by a Gascoigne free kick that bounced a foot
wide and he could not do much about Dennis Wise's stab from close range
that also struck the bar. But David Seaman also needed to be fully
alert, as Colombia's accurate passing at speed on the break occasionally
exposed the heart of England's defence.
ENGLAND -- Seaman, Neville, Le Saux, Redknapp, Adams, Howey, Barmby,
Shearer, McManaman, Gascoigne, Wise. Substitutes -- Flowers, Ruddock,
Lee, Barnes, Sheringham.
COLUMBIA -- Higuita, Santa, Menoeza, Bernudez, Be Cali, Alvarez,
Lozano, Rincon, Valderrama, Asprilla, Valenciano. Substitites --
Chiquillo, Mazziri, Quinones, Gaviria, Leon.
Referee -- M Batta (France).

CELTIC have announced that they had now sold more than 25,000 season
tickets, an increase of 7000 on last year and 18,400 more than in season
1993-94, writes Jim Reynolds. By the time the current applications are
processed, the club anticipates closing at a record 26,000.
The club has stopped taking applications and has started a waiting
list for next season. Managing director Fergus McCann said: ''The
interest generated by the return to Celtic Park, the new stand, Scottish
Cup victory, and the signings of Andreas Thom and John Hughes has been
phenomenal. These have been important factors in attracting back lapsed
supporters and encouraging new fans.''
It was also announced yesterday that, not surprisingly, there will be
no public sale of tickets for the two upcoming Old Firm matches at
Celtic Park -- the Coca-Cola Cup tie on Tuesday, September 19, and the
premier division match on Sunday, September 30. Rangers' allocation for
both matches will be 4700 tickets, and the away support will be located
in the lower and upper east sections of the new stand at the traditional
Rangers' end.

PROMOTER Frank Warren is threatening to hit World Boxing Organisation
super-middleweight champion Steve Collins and Chris Eubank in the pocket
for fighting shy of the pre-fight build-up to Saturday's title return in
Cork.
Warren has written to the WBO asking for a portion of the fighters'
purses -- in Collins' case #1.2m and Eubank's #400,000 -- to be withheld
if they do not attend today's lunchtime news conference.
A head-to-head planned for yesterday had to be cancelled because of
the reluctance of both men to face the media, but Warren will lay down
the law if Eubank and Collins do not show up today, stressing that it is
part of their contractual obligation to ''sell'' the fight.
''Obviously, feelings are running high between the two, but in
refusing to appear at a conference they are clearly not fulfilling this
part of their contractual agreement,'' said Warren.
Eubank's hostile feelings towards Collins have festered since their
first fight in March, which Dubliner Collins won on points to take the
title and Eubank's unbeaten record.
The former champion was incensed by Collins' claims that he used
hynotherapy before the fight, and his subsequent ''loss of life''
comment regarding the Irishman brought him a #5000 fine from the British
Boxing Board of Control.
Eubank said: ''I don't want to see him, I don't want to smell him, I
don't want to breathe the same air as him until such time as it is legal
for me to walk up and bang him in the mouth.''

AS Scotland's Julie Forbes bids to build on her fine form in last
week's English Open, much of the attention in Sweden this week will be
focused on their top three players in the Trygg Hansa Open which begins
today at Haninge, near Stockholm.
Lotta Neumann, the holder, was a convincing winner over the same
course last year, Annika Sorenstam won twice in Europe this year before
her victory in the US Open in July, while Helen Alfredsson, not quite at
her best this season, remains a considerable force.
Even so, Sweden's big three have no room for complacency despite the
absence of Laura Davies, who has returned to the LPGA Tour.
Scotland's Dale Reid also flew out to California yesterday to prepare
for the preliminary tournament at Mission Hills next week when she will
try for her place at the LPGA's qualifying school next month.
Already this year there have been signs that some of the younger
players are making a strong challenge, none more so than Australian
Karrie Webb, who won the British Open at Woburn.
Webb, Caroline Hall, who took the Danish Open by eight strokes two
weeks ago, and Forbes are not content to play supporting roles.
Forbes shot her lowest round on the tour with her 66 in the third
round last week when she finished fourth. ''I feel that I am now playing
better than when I won the French Open last year,'' she said. ''The
confidence from winning in France hardly helped because it was the last
event of the year. It has been like starting all over again this season.
''I am using a Callaway driver and hitting the ball an extra 15 yards
and I have found my putting touch,'' added the Aboyne golfer.

A CLASH of dates has forced Graeme Smith and Fraser Walker to turn
their backs on this season's Scottish Short-course Swimming
Championships.
Following the row over poolside sponsorship branding at the Scottish
age-group championships in June, the short-course event has been
switched from Scotstoun to Ayr and moves forward a week to December 15
to 17.
That is the same weekend as the English National championships, and
Smith and Walker, seeking higher quality of competition in the midst of
an Olympic season, will opt to go south of the Border.
But Walker, who ended a disappointing run by winning the 200 metres
medley at the British National championships in July, will be launching
the new season in Scotland when he chases seven titles at the Larkhall
open meet later this month.
At that event, Walker will rejoin forces with his former Warrender
coach, Kim Swanwick, who has been in New Zealand for the past year. He
returns to Scotland on holiday next week and Walker's only regret is
that it is not a permanent return.
Having been dropped from the Scottish team that competed in the
Canadian championships, Walker has had a change of mind and decided to
bid for a place in the British team for the World Short-course
championships in Brazil in December. A silver medalist in the 200m
medley at the inaugural championships two years ago, he said: ''I feel
I've got a point to prove.''

Scottish judo was yesterday celebrating the inclusion of three Scots
-- the most since 1967 -- in the Great Britain team for the twenty-fifth
World Championships in Mukuari, Japan, this month.
The trio are Joyce Heron (Rosyth) in the under-48K class, Graeme
Randall (Dalkeith), under-78K, and Gary Edwards (Edinburgh), under-86K.
Billy Cusack (Edinburgh) is an official reserve for the under-71K class.
Colin McIver, director of the Scottish Judo Federation, said: ''This
is the biggest boost the sport has had since our medal haul in the 1990
Commonwealth Games.''
McIver -- who also will be going to Japan with the British team as
assistant to coach Neil Adams -- was one of the four Scots who went to
the 1967 world event in Salt Lake City, USA.
Heron, a 30-year-old former nurse and mother of two who is only 4ft
10ins tall, will be going to her second World Championships. A bronze
medallist two years ago, she also won a bronze in the European
Championships in Birmingham earlier this year.
Randall, a 20-year-old Moray House college student who has taken a
year out to concentrate on his sport, is a surprise choice.He was not
selected for the World Student Games which have just finished in Japan,
but he won the European Junior title.
Edwards belongs to Manchester but moved to Edinburgh four years ago
for the sake of his sport, and at 27 at last gets his big break.

HERIOT'S have joined the Scottish rugby clubs with antipodean players
in their ranks. Two midfield backs from New Zealand, Terry Rahui, and
Dave Lewis, have arrived to swell the Edinburgh club's numbers.
Half of the 16 clubs in the first two divisions of the new Tennents
premier championship now have Southern Hemisphere players.
Rahui, a 23-year-old stand-off who has played for Auckland's second
XV, has been pitched straight into the first XV for Heriot's match
against Hawick at Mansfield Park on Saturday.
''We were short at stand-off,'' Fraser Dall, Heriot's director of
rugby, said yesterday, but it was not just to plug a gap that he
welcomed the new fly half. ''He's a running stand-off,'' he remarked in
expectation of seeing such a rarity.
Lewis, also, 23, is a centre who has played for the Canterbury
Emerging XV. Heriot's are holding him in reserve, though perhaps only
until the league match against Watsonians at Goldenacre on Wednesday
next week.

SOMETHING of a historic fixture, the meeting on Saturday between the
high school and academy of Glasgow may be overshadowed by a more
significant link with the past. This year is the 150th anniversary of
the founding of Glasgow Academy and just cause indeed for a series of
celebratory events.
Rugby at the academy -- having opened this special calendar session
with a two-day rugby tournament last Friday and Saturday -- will have as
its centrepiece a 10-day tour to Canada next month. The academy, which
will take a squad of 26 players, will play Appleby College, Midland,
Ridley, and UTS.
Thereafter, there is a special match on November 11, when an immediate
past team, captained by Scottish Schools cap Matt Smith, will play the
current first XV.
Just how Glasgow Academy will fare this season is crystal-ball gazing
at this stage, but coach Stuart McAslan, who won five Scotland B caps in
his days with Heriot's FP and who was also an accomplished sprint
hurdler, is excited about the back division.
''We have experience in Andrew Hosie in the threequarters, Euan Stubbs
at stand-off, and Graham Clark who will captain the side from scrum
half,'' said McAslan, who also singles out lock Ian Daley as one of the
strengths in the forwards. But McAslan has worries about the overall
forward strength. ''We could struggle against big packs,'' he said.
Last weekend's tournament at New Anniesland provided an early form
guide for the academy who had a good win over Morrison's (20-5) before
losing to Hutchesons' (10-3) and then to Strathallan (14-5) in the final
stages of the plate competition. Meanwhile, Glasgow HS narrowly lost to
Heriot's (8-5) and Gordonstoun (12-7) in this group.
Hutchesons' however were the class act here, finishing strongly by
beating Morrison's 15-0 , Strathallan 7-3, and the Academy before
defeating Robert Gordon's College 3-0 in the plate final.
Cup-winners St Aloysius posted a good performance by beating
Stewart's-Melville College 15-7 in the tournament competition, but lost
to Dollar Academy 10-3 and RGS Newcastle 33-0.
No school could challenge outright winners George Watson's College,
who showed the consistently high form of the last two seasons by winning
all their matches and then confirmed their high status with a 19-7 win
over Royal Grammar School, Newcastle, in the tournament final.

LANCOME TROPHY
JOSE Maria Olazabal, a key member of Europe's last four Ryder Cup
teams, hinted strongly yesterday he may have to withdraw from the match
against the United States later this month.
Olazabal, who has been suffering from foot trouble for most of the
year, said on the eve of the Lancome Trophy in Paris: ''Whether I play
at Oak Hill all depends on this week.
''If I do not feel fit enough I will not play. I will decide on Sunday
whether to play but whatever my decision, after the Lancome I will go to
the Mayo Clinic in America to see what they say and take their advice on
my foot problem.''
The 29-year-old Spaniard, who has won 12 and halved two of his 20 cup
rubbers since he made his debut in 1987, added: ''Obviously if I do not
play in the Ryder Cup I will be very disappointed. But I must be
realistic. I do not want to go there with the slightest chance of
letting the team down. I cannot play 36 holes a day and 18 is a
struggle. This is the last chance. If I feel better this week I will go,
if not I won't.
''I am still in the same amount of pain after playing. I have spoken
to Bernard Gallacher and am trying to give myself as much chance as
possible. But if I decide to withdraw I must give the guy who would take
my place enough time to prepare.''
Olazabal had surgery early in the year on the big toe of his right
foot. Since then he has had trouble with the small bones below his third
and fourth toes which he thinks is to do with the nerves in his foot.
''I have no problems hitting the ball,'' he said.
His partner in 15 Ryder Cup fourballs and foursomes, Seve Ballesteros,
said he would not try to influence him.
If Olazabal withdraws, Gallacher can select anyone as his replacement.
He does not have to pick Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez, who finished
No.11 in the points table. The likely choice would be Ian Woosnam, but
Swede Jesper Parnevik is another option.
As for the Lancome Trophy, Nick Faldo has withdrawn because of an
injury to his right wrist, but he has called Gallacher -- currently at
the Canadian Open -- to say he definitely will play at Oak Hill.
Nine members of the European team are playing in Paris -- Olazabal,
Ballesteros, Colin Montgomerie, Sam Torrance, Howard Clark, David
Gilford, Mark James, Bernhard Langer, and Costantino Rocca. So are
Woosnam and Tom Lehman, a member of the American Ryder Cup team.
Seven Scots are among the starters. Sam Torrance, who is No.2 to
Montgomerie in the order of merit.

REQUIRING to beat the two Welsh team boats skippered by Colin Lyons
and Richard Tudor by three clear places in order to win the inaugural
Teacher's Round Britain Challenge, there was no sign of caution from the
Scottish skippers at the start of the final 250-mile sprint from
Hartlepool to Southend-on-Sea yesterday.
Jon Fitzgerald's Glendronach was forced over the start line 15 seconds
early and had to re-start in last place, while Paul Jeffes in Lord
Inverforth was third to cross the line, a position he held until the
second mark of the two-buoy, windward-leeward circuit, which was a
preliminary to the passage out of Hartlepool.
Fitzgerald had worked his way up to sixth place by the main fairway
buoy, just one place behind his Scottish team-mates on Lord Inverforth.
Ireland's David Harte, on Dream of Erin, was back at the front, with a
lead of 2min 45sec over Tudor.

SHINTY
SCOTLAND'S shinty selectors have shown that the nation's football
squad does not have a monopoly on dispensing with the services of their
top goalkeeper.
There is no place in the senior team to face Ireland at the end of the
month for Oban Camanachd's John MacGregor.
The experienced custodian has been outstanding on previous occasions
but an ineffectual display in the representative match at Taynuilt at
the end of last season may have cost him his place. He is replaced by
Fort William's Graeme MacMillan.
Also out squad are Kingussie's Michael Thain and Glasgow Mid Argyll's
former national player-of-the-year, Allan MacInnes. In come Skye's
Willie Cowie, a former national player-of-the-year, and the experienced
Norman MacArthur, of Newtonmore, both for the first time.
Senior coach Donnie Grant warned the 18 named that they are still
playing for 14 places available in the starting line-up. He said: ''The
main plus about the squad is obviously the fact that we don't have to
change too much, and that we have the threat posed by James Clark and
Ronald Ross for the whole match.''
The under-21s will have no more than four players who have been capped
before. Garry MacPherson, the outstanding young Inveraray forward, is
captain. Squads:
Under-21: Gavin Blainey (Oban Camanachd), John Clark (Ballachulish),
Darren Coyle (Lochcarron), David Devine (Oban Camanachd), Stewart
Ferrier (Newtonmore), John Gibson (Kingussie), Kevin Hunter (Glengarry),
Fraser Inglis (Oban Camanachd), Innes MacDonald (Ballachulish), Lorn
MacInnes (Tayforth), Michael MacKintosh (Lochaber), James MacLean
(Glasgow Univ), Garry MacPherson (Inveraray), captain, Neil Robertson
(Fort William), Scott Robertson (Inveraray), Scott Rodger (Kilmallie),
Glen Tonkin (Newtonmore), Yan Valentine (Fort William). Manager: Burton
Morrison, Glasgow Mid Argyll. Assistant: Donald MacDonald, Strachur,
Duncan Kelly, Kilmallie.
Seniors: David Anderson, captain, Alastair Borthwick, David Borthwick,
Stephen Borthwick, (all Kingussie), Willie Cowie (Skye), James Clark,
(Fort William), Michael Clark (Kingussie), Rory Fraser (Glasgow Mid
Argyll), Norman MacArthur (Newtonmore), David McCuish (Oban Camanachd),
Willie MacDonald (Fort William), Neil MacInnes, Dugald MacIntyre, Gordon
MacIntyre (all Oban Camanachd), Graeme MacMillan, Adam Robertson (both
Fort William), Ronald Ross (Kingussie), Victor Smith (Fort William).
Manager: Donnie Grant, Kingussie. Assistant: John MacKenzie, Newtonmore,
Nigel Evans, Oban Camanachd.

DOUBLE Trigger should write his name in the record books with victory
in the East Coast Doncaster Cup today, writes White and Gold.
He can become only the fourth horse this century to land the stayers'
triple crown, joining Alycidon, Le Moss, and Longboat.
The four-year-old was most impressive when he made all to win the
first leg, the two-and-a-half-mile Gold Cup at Royal Ascot in June, by
five lengths. Similar tactics prevailed in the two-mile Goodwood Cup the
following month.
* HELLO Mister, trained by Britain's oldest handler, soared into
racing history by completing back-to-back wins in the Tote-Portland
Handicap at Doncaster yesterday. He joins an elite group of six horses
to have achieved the feat.
Trainer Jack O'Donoghue, 88, has had a double hip replacement and
watched the race back at his training base in Reigate, Surrey.
Hello Mister, the 7-1 favourite, travelled well in the middle of the
pack before being unleashed with a furlong to go by Pat McCabe.

FIVE-TIMES champion National Hunt trainer Martin Pipe notched his
2000th winner when Runaway Pete surged home in the final race at Exeter
yesterday.
It was a champagne finish to an afternoon that had started on a flat
note for the trainer when his hurdling newcomer Wharfedale Music had to
be withdrawn from the opening Devon County Cars Maiden Hurdle with a
blood disorder.
This put a stop to any hopes Pipe might have entertained of saddling
all six winners on the card, a feat he had attempted at the same track
on August 25 when his six-timer came unstuck at the fifth leg, but the
master of Nicholashayne ended up with a treble yesterday to put him on
the 2000 mark.
His Toomuch Toosoon was due to run in the second race on the card, the
Cox of Devon Novices' Handicap Chase, but Pipe's other entry, First
Century, completed a hat trick under stable jockey David Bridgwater.
Pipe's assistant Chester Barnes said of Wharfedale Music: ''She has
got a blood disorder, and Toomuch Toosoon is just not quite right. It is
all rather disappointing.''
However, the disappointment was forgotten once First Century had
opened Pipe's account for the day.
The odds-on Sozzled could finish only third in the novices' handicap
hurdle which followed, but Bridgwater rode even-money chance James Pigg
to an easy 12-lengths success in the Two Rivers Securities Handicap
Hurdle, the fourth race on the card.
Second favourite Blair Castle delayed celebrations by beating Pipe's
Most Equal by a length-and-a-half in the penultimate race but Bridgwater
completed a hat trick when Runaway Pete (2-1), the outsider of three,
upset the joint favourites in the closing handicap hurdle.
The record-breaking handler is only the fourth British trainer to
reach this landmark after Peter Easterby, John Dunlop, and Henry Cecil.
Pipe trained his first winner 20 years ago and in his first 10 years
he had totalled only a relatively modest 280. His strike rate has been
remarkable since then, and his 1000th winner came just five years ago.
His second batch of 1000 includes Grand National hero Miinnehoma and
Champion Hurdler Granville Again, to prove that Pipe can produce quality
as well as quantity.
Although the vast majority of Pipe's winners have come under National
Hunt Rules, his 147 Flat successes include three at Royal Ascot.

MONICA Seles took another step along her comeback trail by beating
No.5 seed Jana Novotna 7-6, 6-2 to reach the semi-final stage of the US
Open in Flushing Meadow yesterday.
Seles, who withdrew from competition for 28 months after having been
stabbed in Germany, moved within two victories of an astounding Open
triumph.
Seles, who struggled with her serve in the first set against her Czech
opponent, took an hour and 27 minutes to post a victory in her first big
tournament test against a serve-and-volleyer since her return.
Both players struggled to hold serve in an error-filled first set, in
which there were six service breaks.
Novotna had the chance to serve out the set after having broken Seles
for a third time to lead 6-5. In the twelfth game, a long forehand by
Seles gave Novotna double set point at 15-40 but the joint world No.1
rose to the challenge.
Seles hit a forehand winner down the line off a first serve to save
one set point, and then sliced a drop volley just over the net to make
it deuce.
Another forehand winner down the line gave her the break and forced
the tie-break, which she won 7-5.
Seles was clearly in charge in the second set, breaking in the third
and seventh games before ending the match with another crisp forehand
winner down the line.
''In the first set I couldn't drop my serve in,'' said Seles. ''I
don't know if I was too nervous or if it was just one of those days.''
The Yugoslav-born American, aiming to win her third Open, said her
winning service return on the first set point was the turning point.
''At that point, I was so mad at myself, I just said 'hit it.'
''I felt much more comfortable after the first set. In the second set
I was going for my shots.''
Later, Spain's Conchita Martinez, the former Wimbledon champion, had a
real struggle to reach the round of the last four on the Stadium Court.
The No.4 seed Martinez dropped the opening set against the big-serving
Dutch woman Brenda Schultz-McCarthy, seeded No.16.
However, Martinez then got her game together, taking the second set on
a tie-break before winning the deciding set 6-2.
Germany's Steffi Graf, the No.1 seed, will play ninth-seed Gabriela
Sabatini, of Argentina, in tomorrow's other semi-final.
* BRITAIN'S two representatives in the US Open boys' singles
championship, James Trotman and Martin Lee, have won through to the
third round. Trotman beat Saurav Panja (India) 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, while Lee
had a 6-7, 6-4, 6-2 win over Keith Brill (USA).

The deadline is six months after the issue of the Valuation Notice,
which means that the last date for appeals in Strathclyde is September
15.
''Many small businesses have not yet appealed -- but they should,
because they could save themselves a lot of money,'' says Bob Mowat, a
rating specialist with D M Hall.
Properties with a rateable value of more than #10,000 will see rates
rises of 10%, plus inflation of 2.4%. Smaller properties with a Rateable
Value of less than #10,000 will see an increase of 7.5%, plus 2.4% for
inflation. These charges do not include water or sewerage charges.

* ANNUAL capital growth figures for Scotland's commercial property
slowed during the month of August, according to the Richard Ellis
Scottish monthly index, which is prepared exclusively for The Herald.
The exception was the retail sector where the annual growth remained
at 4.1%. The office annual capital growth rate slowed from 1.1% to 0.7%
and the industrial sector from 2.0% to 1.9%. As a result, the All
Property annual capital growth figure now stands at 2.0%.
Generally, rental growth for the month of August remained quite
stable. Both the monthly and annual rental growth figures for the retail
sector remained constant at 1.2% and zero growth respectively. The
office annual growth rate slowed to 0.1% while the industrial sector
demonstrated improved annual rental growth of 0.6%.
A contributory factor to the slowing of the annual capital growth
rates was an outward shift in yields on offices. Total returns for the
office, retail and industrial sectors stand at 8.4%, 10.2% and 11.3%
respectively for the month of August.

THE Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre has celebrated its 10th
anniversary.
And typical of a facility which has enriched Scotland's cultural,
entertainment, conference and business life over the past decade, it has
blown out the candles and promptly called in the bulldozers.
Work started this week on a massive new extension of its conference
facilities which, when it is completed in 1997, will enable the SECC to
compete with the very best conference centres in Europe.
The #30 million project, financed by Glasgow City Council, will be
built by Bovis Construction to an imaginative design by the
internationally acclaimed architect, Sir Norman Foster.
Included in the plan is an auditorium accommodating more than 3000
delegates over three levels, together with a plethora of smaller meeting
rooms and supporting facilities. It will be weatherproof too, with
direct links to the existing halls and the nearby Moat House Hotel,
making it the first fully integrated conference and exhibition complex
in the UK.
With over 12 million visitors since 1985, or around 1.2 million
annually, the SECC can now claim to be Scotland's biggest attraction,
surpassing even Edinburgh Castle and the Burrell Collection.
Voted Best Exhibition Centre in the World by readers of Conferences
and Exhibitions International, it brings an estimated #50m in revenue
into the Glasgow area each year and supports 2000 jobs within the
community. These figures are expected to increase to #70m and 2800 jobs
when the latest phase is up and running.
Naturally it generated some opposition when the original plans were
mooted. In true Scottish style, most these centred on the cost. It would
never make money, the ratepayers couldn't afford it and who needs it
anyway?
Today's management team can cheerfully point out that not only does it
generate money off site, but it is one of the very few exhibition and
conference centres in Europe operating on a strictly commercial basis,
and one of even fewer which actually makes a profit.
On the entertainment front, the SECC has secured a worldwide
reputation as a must-not-miss venue when major tours are being planned.
Stars such as Eric Clapton, Diana Ross, Elton John and many others
have visited, along with Pavarotti, whose two visits to the same UK
venue can be counted as another first.
Oddly enough, one superstar even managed to go unnoticed by his fans.
SECC staff recall Bob Dylan reading a newspaper on the concourse while
concert goers walked past. Nor did all of the staff recognise him. On
the same occasion he was given a ticking off by the halls manager for
riding a bicycle on the premises.
Entertainers of this calibre would normally have bypassed Scotland due
to the lack of a suitable venue. The same could be said of other events,
such as Disney on Ice, world championship boxing and many others.
But with something different happening almost every third day, the
extra room provided by the new facility will relieve some of the
existing pressure on space and greatly enhance the opportunities for the
SECC to attract even more business.
Chief executive Mike Closier said of the new extension: ''The dramatic
exterior combined with the extensive yet compact seating configuration
provides a dramatic setting for large conferences. The integrated
conference and exhibition facilities that the SECC will be able to offer
to national and international markets will be the very best in Europe.''
Glasgow City Council leader, Pat Lally, added: ''The new conference
auditorium will provide the very high standard of comfort and
accommodation which is essential if Glasgow is to win business in the
highly competitive international conference market.''
Given the SECC's track record, there is every reason to expect these
objectives will be met.

THE opening event in 1985 was a concert by the Scottish National
Orchestra under the direction of Neeme Jarvi. This was rapidly followed
by two of the most popular regulars, the Modern Homes Exhibition and the
Scottish Motor Show, both of which traditionally attract well over
100,000 visitors.
Even in the darkest days of winter, the lights of the Big Red Shed
provide an irresistible lure. A record 303,000 people attended the 93/4
Carnival, now firmly established as one of Scotland's major festive
season attractions.

Formed from the remains of two liquidated engineering companies, a
lean and fit Walker MacLeod quickly spotted a niche in the market and,
as Bill Knox found out, has since gone from strength to strength
Companies which have achieved similar quality accreditations know the
standards that are involved and the high quality workmanship represented
A GLASGOW metal fabrication and electrical engineering firm which rose
from the remains of two liquidated engineering companies has a new
achievement to add to its already impressive list of successes. Walker
MacLeod, located at Hillington Industrial Estate, has achieved ISO 9001
and 9002 quality accreditation, awarded by National Quality Assurance.
''ISO9001 was awarded for our electrical switchgear side, where a
design element is included, ISO 9002 was for the metalworking and
electrical contracting side of our operation,'' said managing director
Mr Jim Walker. ''Everyone here is delighted. A lot of work was involved,
but although the award was only recently made, we are already seeing
results in terms of new doors being opened for future business. We have
also received considerable congratulations from our existing customers.
''In some ways, it has almost been like joining a club. Companies
which have achieved similar quality accreditations know the standards
that are involved and the high quality workmanship represented.''
The Walker MacLeod achievement is the latest chapter in a story which
began in l98l when two major Glasgow companies, John Yuill Metalwork Ltd
and AWD Engineering Ltd, the latter involved in electrical and
electronic engineering, went into liquidation.
Jim Walker, a time-served Glasgow engineer, had been appointed general
manager of both companies only six months earlier. The Hillington
operation had been mainly involved in building light electrical trucks.
''I discussed the overall picture with a very sympathetic liquidator,
who agreed that the metalworking side of the business seemed viable,''
said Jim Walker. ''I managed to raise funds toward that end, and with
the late David MacLeod, who had been workshop foreman and who had been
employed in the plant for over forty years, we gathered a few of the
former employees together in what amounted to a salvage operation.
''We were in the same factory building as before, a total workforce of
eight, when Walker MacLeod began trading in January l982. At the start,
we only needed one workshop bay out of the total of three-and-a-half
available. We concentrated on general sheet metalwork enclosures for
electrical components.
''We found the gap in the market which I had believed existed.'' That
first year's turnover was #220,000. Year by year that has grown ever
since, until the current annual turnover stands at #2.4m. The workforce
has grown to a total of 74 employees, every one of the workshop bays
available is now fully in use, and a quest is under way for more
workspace.
Working as sub-contractors, carrying out sheet metal fabrication and
painting, manufacturing switchgear, instrumentation and control systems
and carrying out electrical and instrument installations, Walker
MacLeod's products are now part of major construction schemes in most
parts of the world.
''Right from the start we aimed at ensuring customer satisfaction, and
we have always had a high proportion of repeat business in all our
market sectors,'' said Jim Walker.
''We see that as a testimony to the quality of our workmanship, and it
was one of the factors in our decision to achieve ISO quality
accreditation.''
The upward production graph achieved by the new small company,
including work for former clients of the two liquidated concerns, ranged
from the construction of cabinets to generator canopies and control
boxes. Then a further major step took place in l985 when the main Watson
Dundas company was liquidated.
The born-again Hillington firm was able to acquire some key members of
that workforce who had been made redundant, and then diversified into
the manufacture of control gear and general electrical engineering.
Walker MacLeod was soon able to offer a comprehensive in-house service
from design and manufacturing to installation, commissioning and
maintenance.
''We had started off making the boxes, we had grown to the point of
designing and installing the equipment which went inside our boxes,''
said Jim Walker. ''We remained, as we are now, very much a
sub-contractor, but as specialists in the design and build of electrical
instrumentation and switchgear control panels covering full design and
procurement.''
Today the Hillington firm's products are at the heart of key equipment
used by concerns as varied as water and power boards and by key
industries from food to chemical manufacturing. At any time, work in
progress can be as varied as equipment required for a new supermarket to
the needs of a whole sewage or water treatment plant.
Current work ranges from a contract for a sewage works at North
Berwick to generator canopies for a prominent international company.
Customers include John Brown, NEI Peebles and Aggreko Generators.
''Despite our growth we are still small in our field,'' said Jim
Walker. ''But we are independent and we are specialists. The market for
our services was, in fact, created by the cutbacks and changes in
Scottish industrial patterns. For instance, some of the work we do
would, at one time, have been carried out by companies heavily
associated with the marine industry.
''They have dwindled. We fill the gap which has been left in the
market and have built ourselves into a strong position based on our
reputation for reliability and quality.
''We believe the way ahead is clear for further physical as well as
financial growth. We don't mind anyone saying we rose out of the ashes.
We are proud of it.''

THE Confederation of British Industry has set out framework proposals
for boosting wealth creation and economic growth in Scotland.
In particular, the CBI wants to encourage more Scots to start their
own businesses instead of waiting for someone else to offer them a job.
But better education and training will be need to achieve this aim,
along with a new approach by careers advisers in schools.
John Ward, the outgoing chairman of CBI Scotland, said the birth rate
for new businesses here was much lower than the UK average and too many
good Scottish inventions ended up being commercially developed overseas.
Presenting the Scottish Business Agenda, the result of a consultation
exercise on ways of boosting wealth creation in Scotland, Mr Ward said
the UK as a whole had fallen behind major competitors such as the US and
Japan in converting good ideas into competitive goods and services.
He said our social services were growing faster than our ability to
pay for them and warned that Scotland was in danger of slipping into
''genteel poverty'' as a result.
''If we do not create more wealth we are going to end up with a
tighter and tighter squeeze on our social services,'' Mr Ward said,
urging overall UK investment to be raised to 20% of gross domestic
product.
The Scottish Business Agenda was drawn up after several months of
consultation with other business organisations, trade unions, political
parties, academics and church leaders.
The CBI said an ''excellent consensus'' had been achieved and over the
next few months it would put forward concrete action plans to tackle the
main problems identified.
It said a stable low-inflation economic environment was essential for
promoting the investment that Britain badly needs to restore its
position as a leading world economy.
In particular, investment in roads and railways should be raised to
German levels, and in electronic digital networks it should be increased
to the level of Singapore.
Within Scotland, the CBI wants to increase the rate of business starts
per head of population to the US level and improve the level of service
offered by companies to their customers.
Mr Ward called for better education and training to achieve this and
said teachers should encourage school leavers to set up their own
businesses as well as looking for someone to give them a job.
Grant Baird of Scottish Financial Enterprise, which backs the CBI
findings, emphasised the importance of better telecommunications and
transport links to secure Scotland's future as a growth centre for
financial services.

THE Borders-based contract electronics manufacturer, Keltek, has won a
multi-million pound order to supply satellite navigation systems for a
joint German venture, Nortel Dasa, which involves Northern Telecom and
Daimler-Benz Aerospace.
The contract, which is likely to confirmed at the end of this month,
is seen a major breakthrough for the Scottish company, taking it into
the lucrative satellite arena for the first time.
It will be among the largest overseas contracts secured by the Keltek
Group in an area of business it has been developing with assistance from
Scottish Trade International. The deal comes two weeks after the company
announced a #4.5m takeover of EDMS of Maldon, a major Essex contract
electronics manufacturer.
The takeover, seen as a key step by Keltek in creating extra jobs and
a global #100m business, was hailed as a significant boost for
Scotland's electronics industry.
Andrew Allen, the company's business development director, said in
this week's edition of the Electronic Times that the German deal was a
''turnkey manufacturing contract''.
He told The Herald yesterday: ''We have signed a two-year contract
against a programme expected to last five to seven years which is
expected to be worth #5m a year to Keltek, and could add about 18% to
the company's annual turnover.''
Mr Allen paid tribute to the efforts of Scottish Trade International's
German operation which he said had been instrumental in introducing the
deal.
The contract will involve Keltek sourcing 70% of the components in the
UK, assembling and testing each system, and then shipping them direct to
Mercedes- Benz dealerships worldwide.
Keltek, which currently employs about 270 workers in Kelso, in the
telecommunications, computing, medical, multi-media, and instrumentation
field, will invest up to #300,000 in test equipment for the German
contract.

IT has taken the stock market 11 trading days, interrupted by the
August bank holiday Monday, to post a fresh record.
The market has been pulled in opposite directions by an improving
interest rate environment at home and abroad and fears that the company
results season may contain its share of disappointments.
Yesterday's rise of 25.3 points to 3557.8 took the FTSE-100 share
index into uncharted territory. A fresh intra-day record of 3561.5 was
also established.
The previous record close on August 21 fell between two stools. The
Footsie had still to test the intra-day record established in February
1994. This was achieved the morning after the night before, but the
market immediately went off the boil and spent one day trading below
3500.
Volumes improved yesterday and there was talk in the City of
large-scale institutional buying. The top fund managers are now firmly
back in control after the traditional August holiday period.
Takeover interest does not seem to have been a major factor in
yesterday's rally, though recycling funds from earlier bid activity is a
major support for the market. The biggest companies reporting this week,
Glaxo Wellcome, BTR and British Gas, produce their results later today.
Any nasty surprises (remember BTR's margins shock a year ago) could send
share prices into reverse.
The UK market is undervalued compared with Wall Street where the bulls
have been in the ascendent for most of the year. Across the Atlantic
interest rates have begun to edge down and may have further to fall.
Here too each set of economic statistics seems to drive another nail
into the coffin of the dearer money lobby. The futures markets suggest
the current interest rate regime will survive until the middle of next
year. This is a big change of sentiment since the spring.
But the worry is that the corporate sector can hardly expect to come
through the evident slowdown in activity unscathed.
Manufacturing
slows down
THE 0.4% fall in manufacturing output in July in contrast to City
expectations of a small increase was not quite as black a statistic as
the bald figures suggest.
Economists are rightly wary of jumping to too many conclusions on the
back of just one month's data. Yesterday's figures were accompanied by
modest changes to previously published statistics. The overall effect of
this was to revise upwards by 0.2% the level of manufacturing output in
the second quarter.
In the latest three months manufacturing output increased by 0.2%
compared with the previous three months and was 1.9% higher than in the
same three months a year ago. Just over half the manufacturing sectors
sported increases in the latest three months.
Undoubtedly a stocks overhang is having a negative impact on output.
The underlying trend still appears to be positive but at a much slower
pace than the heady growth of last year.
The industrial production figures were also a mixed bag. Boosted by a
sharp recovery in North Sea oil production in July after extensive
maintenance work in June, industrial production rose by 0.3%, but in the
latest three months output was 0.1% lower than in the previous three,
though still 1.7% higher than in the same three months a year ago.
Overall the figures provide a further justification for the brave
decision by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, in May to
ignore the demand by the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George,
to raise base rates by half a point.
The two men meet again today amid increasing speculation that Mr
George will quietly change his tune. He has been wrong-footed by the
slowdown in the economy, a dollar-induced recovery in sterling, and a
slightly better than expected inflation outcome.
Had Mr Clarke heeded the Governor's earlier advice there might now be
a need to reduce rates. Instead, they seem to be on hold for the
foreseeable future. But speculation that rates have peaked and the next
movement will be downwards is decidedly premature.
A weekend circular from the award-winning economics team at Goldman
Sachs forecast that growth will start to pick up again in the first half
of next year, justifying a half-point rise in rates to 7.25%. At this
level they are expected to stabilise until after the General Election.
The weakness in manufacturing is likely to persist for a few months,
but the lessons of history, reinforced by the recent experience in the
US, suggest it will be a temporary phenomenon. Recent figures on retail
sales and consumer spending suggest that the consumer is beginning to
come back to life.
Dollar fails to
breakthrough
THE dollar had everything going for it yesterday. There was another
huge fall in Japan's controversial trade surplus on the back of which
the Bank of Japan did everything in its power to bolster the dollar at
the expense of the yen, whose strength has been a major factor in
extending Japan's worst post-war recession.
Money market interest rates fell sharply in Germany for the third week
in a row. The Bundesbank cut its repo rate by 0.1% to 4.2%. A fortnight
ago the key discount and Lombard rates were cut by 0.5% to 3.5% and 5.5%
respectively, but no further change is expected to emerge from today's
council meeting.
The dollar, however, failed to breakthrough the 100 yen mark, and was
below its best levels by the end of European trading. The Federal
Reserve was nowhere to be seen amid speculation that it would follow
through the efforts of the Bank of Japan.
Germany and Japan both want to see the rally in the dollar sustained,
but there are some signs that it is running out of steam. The pound has
made up a good deal of lost ground as the dollar has staged a partial
recovery over the summer.
At one point yesterday sterling's trade-weighted index had climbed to
85.1, but by the afternoon it had slipped back to 84.9, just 0.1 better
on the day. At this level it is off the critical list with its fall so
far this year cut back to a touch over 4%, but the outlook is heavily
dependent on the fortunes of the dollar, which could be vulnerable to
further rate reductions in the US.

MINING giant RTZ surprised the stock market with a
larger-than-expected surge in profits and the shares jumped 25p to 905p.
Profits before exceptionals were two-thirds higher at #639m in the
first half of the year as a result of higher metal and mineral prices.
The advance in earnings per share was more modest at 59% following a
higher tax charge.
After allowing for the writing down of an Australian coal operation,
earnings per share were 20% higher.
A foreign income interim dividend of 10.5p has been declared, an
increase of 17%.
The bulk of the profits gain came in minerals and metals operations,
where profits rose 61% to #341m, reflecting a 42% rise in ferrous metal
prices. Internationally traded coal prices were also firmer, though US
domestic coal prices were flat, as was gold.
Industrial minerals made 16% more at #86m. Prices and production
volumes of RTZ's main industrial minerals were ahead, though diamond
prices were down. Associates' contribution showed the same trend, rising
21% to #217m.
Prices are expected to remain firm. Chairman Sir Derek Birkin
commented: ''A revival of the US economy from its spring pause, modest
growth in European activity and continued rapid expansion of Asian
economies other than Japan ensure that global demand for most minerals
and metals is expanding.''

THE go-ahead was given yesterday for the #66m development of Mobil's
Nevis South field in the North Sea 300 kilometres north-east of
Aberdeen, writes GRAEME SMITH.
Energy Minister Tim Eggar announced approval at Offshore Europe for
the third in a series of expected sub-sea satellites which will keep the
Beryl field in production beyond 2010.
''It follows Ness and Linnhe and I understand that Mobil and their
partners are already working on further satellites,'' he said.
''Reserves from Nevis South are estimated to be in the region of 50
million barrels of oil and 175 billion cubic feet of gas.
''Nevis South is not a large field by North Sea standards. Its
significance lies in the way it is being developed, the novel technology
being employed, and what it promises for the future of similar fields.''
Nevis, discovered 21 years ago, will be developed using innovative
diverless technology developed in North-east Scotland.
Nevis South, the first part of the phased development, is expected to
start oil production in October next year with an initial rate of 13,500
barrels of oil a day.
''Nevis has been on the drawing board a long time and it is only
recently that improved technology and lower development costs have
combined to enable the project to go ahead,'' said Lance Johnson,
chairman of Mobil North Sea.
* SPEARHEAD Communications, the privately owned company which runs
Offshore Europe and other major international exhibitions, has been
acquired by American company Production Group International Inc of
Virginia.
They also run Heli-Tech, the leading international event for the
helicopter industry, and Oceanology International, the premier
conference and exhibition for the marine science and technology
industry.
Spearhead will become the first operating company of the newly formed
company PGI Europe, a wholly owned company of PGI whose chairman will be
David Stott, chairman of Spearhead.
''Using this merger PGI Europe will also seek out other similar
organisers who might add value to our operations,'' said Mark Sirangelo,
chairman and chief executive of PGI.

CLYDEPORT, which is bidding against Forth Ports to buy the port of
Dundee, has turned in an excellent half-year performance.
The company benefited from a 75% increase in coal traffic at its
Hunterston ore terminal and raked in interest on #15m raised from a
Stock Exchange flotation and the sale of development land last year.
As a result, profits soared 47% to #2.6m in the six months to June 30,
while turnover increased 25% to #9.4m.
Clydeport shares rose 10p to 183p in celebration of the good
performance which came in at the top end of most forecasts.
The company has accumulated a #10.9m cash pile, but this is likely to
disappear overnight if its bid to buy the Dundee facility from the
Government is successful.
Analysts reckon that the port of Dundee, which has a turnover of about
#5m a year, will sell for between #10m and #15m.
Clydeport and its east coast rival Forth Ports are the only two
bidders left in the privatisation contest following the elimination or
withdrawal of all other contestants.
Announcing this yesterday, Dundee Port Authority said the winner would
be revealed later this month.
Clydeport executive chairman John Mather said that if his company got
Dundee it would develop the port's overland links with Glasgow,
Greenock, Hunterston and Ardrossan.
''We believe that there are natural corridors of traffic between us
that can be enhanced and developed,'' he said.
But Mr Mather said Clydeport also had its eye on other possible
acquisitions in Scotland.
The company is viewed as a potential bidder for the Rosyth naval base,
which Forth Ports is also interested in.
Analyst Richard Andrews at Bell Lawrie White in Edinburgh said
Clydeport might put in a more competitive bid for Dundee than Forth
Ports since the Glasgow-based company had more to gain in the long run
from establishing a strategic toe-hold on the east coast.
Dundee would only have in-fill value for Forth Ports, which operates
Leith, Grangemouth and four other ports on the Firth of Firth, he noted.
Clydeport has given Hunterston a new lease of life since it purchased
the ore terminal from British Steel in December 1993 following the
closure of the Ravenscraig steel plant.
The port, which can handle ships of up to 350,000 tonnes deadweight,
was orginally built to import coal and iron ore for Ravenscraig.
But Clydeport has successfully converted the facility into a
trans-shipment terminal for reloading coal imports on to smaller vessels
for regional distribution.
Hunterston currently earns most of its income from trans-shipping coal
to Kilroot power station in Northern Ireland.
Mr Mather said if coal prices improve, Hunterston may also be used for
shipping Scottish coal to export markets.
Clydeport's general cargo volumes were little changed during the first
half of this year, although there was some increase in bulk liquids and
new container services were started up to France and Ireland.
Nevertheless, the sharp increase in coal traffic increased operating
profits by 24% to #2.5m.
The bottom line increase of 47% was topped up by interest earned on
the #11m sale of development land at Braehead in September last year and
the #4.1m proceeds of the flotation in December.
Mr Mather warned that Clydeport profits would probably grow more
slowly in the second half of the year.
''We want to sound a cautionary note . . . You cannot go on sustaining
that level,'' he said.
Bell Lawrie White has raised its full-year profit forecast slightly to
#5.3m in the light of Clydeport's good first-half figures, but this
still falls short of the #5.6m achieved in 1994.
The full-year dividend is seen unchanged at 4.1p after a 1.4p interim
payout.

CLYDEPORT and Forth Ports are now the only contenders bidding for the
port of Dundee and the Government will decide later this month which one
has been successful. ROBERT POWELL looks at the two rivals.
FORTH Ports, which was floated by the Government in 1992, controls six
ports in the Firth of Forth, including Grangemouth with its massive oil
and chemicals traffic.
It is one of Britain's biggest port operators, and its pre-tax profit
of #13.7m in 1994 dwarfed the #5.6m achieved by its west coast rival
Clydeport.
Forth Ports is shopping to buy more ports on the east coast and has
even looked over the Border to England. Right now its attention is
focussed on Dundee and Rosyth.
Forth Ports is bidding alone for Dundee, but it forms part of the
Rosyth 2000 consortium that wants to buy the Navy's port facilities
there when they are privatised next year.
Its partners in the consortium are Babcock International, which
already operates the dockyard at Rosyth, ScottishPower and Bank of
Scotland.
The main ports operated by Forth Ports at present are Grangemouth --
the site of a huge BP refinery -- and Leith, which handles general
cargo.
The company also owns Granton, which has more potential as development
land than as a commercial port, and a string of three small ports in
Fife -- Burtisland, Kirkcaldy and Methil.
Forth Ports already makes handsome profits on waterfront development
land in Leith which brings in rental of #3m a year. The centrepiece of
its urban renewal drive in Leith is the new Scottish Office building at
Victoria Quay.

CADBURY Schweppes is busy expanding its beverages and confectionery
business worldwide particularly into emerging markets such as India,
Russia and China.
It is probably just as well because competition in the UK remains
intense with margins under pressure from price-conscious consumers,
higher raw material costs and marketing expenditure in support of its
brands.
In the six months to June 17 profits before tax inched up by just 0.6%
to #206m but that was after #30m was set aside to cover costs associated
with restructuring.
A useful #2.4m profit contribution came from its stake in Camelot,
organiser of the National Lottery which had sales of more than #1100m in
the period from its start last November to March 31.
The interim dividend is raised by 6.5% to 4.9p reflecting the group's
resilient underlying performance.
Cadbury Schweppes' sales and profits grew in all territories despite
the difficult trading environment. A major event in the first half was
the completion of the Dr Pepper/Seven-Up drinks acquisition in the US.
The acquisition has significantly changed the nature of the group, one
of whose aims is to be the largest and most successful brand owner
operating in the non-cola sector of the worldwide drinks market. Chief
executive David Wellings said it was as significant an event as the
merger between Cadbury and Schweppes in the late sixties.
Dr Pepper contributed sales of #162m and profits of about #47m in the
four months it was part of the group.
Cadbury Schweppes is wise to avoid the cola market which in the UK at
least has become overcrowded in the past two years as the Big Three
supermarket chains have launched their own-brand American colas.
Sainsbury's Classic Cola has been particularly successful.
These launches have reduced margins in Coca-Cola Schweppes Beverages
(CCSB) in the UK, although its sales have been growing strongly in fast
food outlets and vending machines.
Derek Williams, managing director of CCSB, said its competitors would
''have to have a rational look at next year'' and find the right balance
between going for volume growth and sound economics. CCSB currently has
24.6% of the UK soft drinks market.
The confectionery business is being steadily rolled out into new
markets such as Russia and China. Cadbury performed well in the UK aided
by the successful launch of Time Out and increased its market share.
This helped offset slight profit declines in the Trebor Bassett sugar
confectionery business, although particular products such as Jelly
Babies, Wine Gums and Soft Mints sold well.
The balance sheet was inevitably affected by the Dr Pepper
acquisition, rising to #1400m, but Mr Wellings said borrowings had not
been and would not be a constraint on investment elsewhere.
Indeed, just after the half-year-end, Cadbury secured the number one
slot in Canadian sweet confectionery with the acquisition of Allan
Candy. The company's interest cover is a satisfactory 6.5 times albeit
down from 12.6 at the same time in 1994.
The interim results were in line with City expectations and the shares
rose 4p to 496p.

BOTH the Halifax and Nationwide building societies, respectively
Britain's largest and third-largest mortgage lenders, are forecasting a
recovery in house prices next year after two years of no growth and
earlier widespread falls in prices which plunged borrowers into negative
equity.
Some areas clearly suffered more than others with Scotland holding up
well against other parts of the UK. South-east England was particularly
badly hit.
Last week Abbey National reduced its mortgage rate in an attempt to
stimulate the market and increase its share. This has been followed by
cuts from other lenders, including the Halifax and Nationwide.
The Halifax predicts that with inflation at around 3%, house prices
could rise by 5% next year and for the remainder of the nineties, while
the Nationwide is looking for a more modest 3% growth next year with
transaction levels rising by 10% or more.
Both, though, have been forced to revise previous optimistic forecasts
in a housing market which has, for the most part, remained stubbornly in
the doldrums. Early last year, the Halifax was forecasting a 5% increase
in prices for the year but as the months passed this was slowly whittled
down to a plateau. The Nationwide suffered a similar experience.
So it remains to be seen whether this time round the projections prove
to be justified. The changes in income support and lowering of mortgage
interest relief have not helped matters, and it is felt that the
Government is close to ruling out any special measures to aid the
housing market in November's Budget. However, the market is expected to
be helped by a rise in real incomes.
An article in the latest issue of the Council of Mortgage Lenders'
quarterly economic journal, Housing Finance, said the market faced a
classic chicken-and-egg dilemma -- buyers would not be tempted into it
until rising house prices offered the prospect of a capital gain, and
house prices could not recover until buyers reappeared.
The article said the largest factor in influencing the decision to buy
a home is price. Buyers' expectations of even small price rises and the
possibility of their property increasing in value can outweigh the
expenses of owning a home.
The Halifax, meanwhile, has reported an increase in profits from #486m
to #517m in the six months to July 31.
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts rose to #37m from #32m in the
same period last year but were still comfortably down on the #56m seen
in the second half of 1994-95.
The society said the first half of 1995 remained difficult for the
housing market while total retail savings flows showed some recovery
from low levels in 1993 and 1994.
Gross and net mortgage lending increased over a period in which both
the number of housing transactions and house prices continued to weaken.
Lending was boosted by #1500m arising from the purchase of BNP Mortgages
(Holdings) in February.
The net interest margin continued to narrow, falling to 2.07% compared
with 2.1% in the previous six months and 2.15% in the first half of last
year.
The results, which will be the last reported without the contribution
from the recently acquired Leeds Building Society, were described by
Halifax chairman Jon Foulds as a fine achievement, marking a strong
performance by the society despite the continued weakness in the housing
market.

INDUSTRIAL group BBA underlined its success in acquiring the Swiss
textiles and paper company Holvis with figures showing a 57% increase in
interim pre-tax profits.
The company unveiled profits of #60.5m in the six months to June 30,
up from #38.3m in the same period last year.
Chairman Vanni Treves said: ''BBA is now a more focused and profitable
group than it was two years ago and will be less exposed to the economic
cycle as a result of the rebalancing we have carried out.''
In April, the group sold its automotive products division for #181.2m,
and in June it bought Holvis for #239m after a protracted battle.
However, it has since agreed to sell the latter's paper distribution
subsidiary for #116m, enabling it to retain the non-woven textiles
business for #123m.
The group said its transportation division had performed well, the

THERE is something endearing about the SNP's love affair with
Hollywood. First there was Sean Connery who, from his self-imposed exile
in Spain, was recruited to preach to the rest of us, who have stayed
home to pay our taxes, of the incomparable benefits of shuffling off the
English yoke. He is well versed, having done so himself and chosen that
haven of rectitude, Felipe Gonzalez's socialist paradise where
corruption is widespread, unemployment the highest in Western Europe,
and where you can't even trust the label on a bottle of alleged Rioja.
And who props him up? Why none other than Alex Salmond's role model,
those caring, selfless nationalists, the Catalans. But then when a great
actor speaks we should all listen. Not, mind you, that Mr Connery will
be joining us in the spirited new adventure he proposes, although no
doubt he will send a postcard now and then wishing he was here.
Next on stage is the bewildered Mad Max himself, the Australian Mel
Gibson whose photograph was purloined to adorn a Nationalist pamphlet
extolling the virtues of independence to accompany his new film,
Braveheart, about the exploits of a genuine Scottish hero, William
Wallace. To be fair to Mr Gibson he admits to being surprised at having
been adopted by the Scottish Nationalists and of knowing nothing about
the party. That is obvious. Otherwise he would have known that the Nats
like to stir up passions, although these tend to focus on more recent
events, like the Battle of Bannockburn.
Nevertheless, the chief of the groupies, Alex Salmond, was at the
Stirling Castle bash, no doubt sidling up to the bekilted actor.
''Excuse me, Mel, but could I have your autograph? It's not for me, you
understand, but for a friend. Just sign it 'To Wee Eck, best wishes,
Mel'.''
What of course we all want to know is just how far this star gazing
goes. Is it true, for instance, that he has a photograph of Julia
Roberts above his bed? Not for any lascivious reason, needless to say,
but because she, too, is a Scottish heroine of sorts. After all, didn't
she play the downtrodden spouse trying to escape a brutal marriage in
Sleeping with the Enemy -- an allegory of the Union if ever there was
one.
Now she has elevated Mary Reilly -- you remember her, she was Doctor
Jekyll's housekeeper -- into a major cinematic celebrity. It would have
surprised Robert Louis Stevenson, who devoted only one line to her. But
this is to miss the point. It is not accuracy which is important, says
Mr Salmond to those who question the veracity of Braveheart, but the
drama.
What better then than Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde as a parody of the Union,
two-faced with the eponymous heroine representative of the silent
majority of Scots. And as Miss Roberts doesn't like Stevenson's ending
she has substituted a happy one. Isn't Hollywood wonderful? No wonder
the Nationalists love it. It is interactive politics. The bits you don't
like you can change or ignore. For instance, Jessica Lange urinating
into a loch in the Liam Neeson film Rob Roy was environmentally
incorrect so she does not join the pantheon of Hollywood idols. Nor does
Oliver Reed of The Bruce, a fourteenth-century Rab C Nesbit, for as we
all know, Scots neither urinate nor drink.
The consequence of this fantasy is the politics of virtual reality, of
which the SNP's Treasury spokesman, John Swinney, is a leading exponent.
His paper this week, ''Paying our fair share -- and more'', which
allegedly argues the economic case for independence, has all the
ingredients.
To play is quite simple. Instead of one of those cumbersome helmets,
what you do is wrap a Saltire around your head, blocking out reality,
and chant a mantra of figures. These are helpfully provided, but any
will do. And you can play it at different levels. For by-elections like
Perth and Kinross you will see a wasteland, the result of a fallout from
the Active Union. Culturally we have been devastated -- no James Kelman,
no Willie McIlvanney, no Janice Galloway (I never said it couldn't be
fun).
Our education system lies in ruins as we enviously survey the success
of schools in Bradford or Islington. Our legal system is impotent and
only John Major is allowed to appear on our television sets before
elections. But, wait, there is hope on the horizon. (At this point it is
essential to murmur the name Rosie Cunningham). Suddenly it appears that
the heel of Unionism has not extinguished every last vestige of
enterprise. Scotland, despite 300 years of neglect, industrial rape, and
the theft of our resources, is in fact a prosperous country. Well, well,
well.
We can go it alone then, can't we? Mmmm. The problem is that actually
we would be about #30m better off each year, according to the
by-election version. Not much more than Anthea Turner gives out on TV
for a roll-over week on the lottery. That will never do. And it doesn't
inspire confidence if the profit from Scotland's entire manufacturing,
construction, agriculture, and service industries is only slightly more
than what a couple of Midlands joiners can pick up by choosing their own
six numbers.
But a few months is a long time in the virtual reality world of
Nationalist politics. In the latest, advanced version there is a much
more acceptable figure -- a #200m budget surplus relative to the UK. A
seven-fold increase. Such developmental skills. Bill Gates and Windows
95 -- eat your heart out.
Unfortunately for the Nationalists -- and for the rest of us on whose
votes they are counting -- the real world cannot be blocked out. Their
figures are bunkum. Most academics agree with both major political
parties, Labour and Conservative, that the Scottish deficit ranges from
between #6000m to #8000m. At best -- and depending on variables such as
income tax payments in any particular year -- the figure could be #1000m
or so less.
The SNP makes wild assumptions about North Sea oil revenues, income
distribution, and income from investments which are quite properly open
to challenge. What, in reality, it offers is a leap in the dark which,
if wrong, would mean draconian cuts in not only public services but the
standard of living of every Scot.
But this is not new. The way the SNP embraces the European Union, with
its spurious ''Independence in Europe'' slogan, is similar: it is pure
romanticism. It's the it'll-be-all-right-on-the-night syndrome. It has
yet to explain how the transfer of more control to EU institutions will
increase the power of national governments, especially small ones like
Scotland. And the only difference in joining a single currency and
transferring the running of the Scottish economy to German central
bankers from its current position within the UK is that Mr Swinney will
be able to calculate the deficit in ecus, francs, or even Deutschmarks.
If they let him. That's the reality.

AWFUL results from Amec, the construction and engineering group, were
thoroughly discounted and its shares rose 3p to 62p on news that the
long dispute over the Tiffany contract was at last behind it, writes
CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Fears of heavy losses from the contract, which was to build a
production platform for the Agip oil company, have been behind the
shares' weakness for many months. Lengthy negotiations have been
concluded and Amec expects to receive a payment of between #50m and
#60m. This would greatly strengthen its financial position at a time of
tough trading, replacing debt by net cash of #20m to #15m by the
year-end.
This took the edge off the poor results for the first half to June,
when earnings per shares were only just positive. The dividend is held
at 1.5p but is virtually uncovered.
Profits fell to #6.1m against an already depressed #9.1m. Amec is
reacting to the dearth of work at home by getting more contracts
overseas, which account for 35% of business, up from 25% a year ago. The
group is also going for larger deals which make use of its
multi-disciplinary skills. The value of over half the projects taken on
exceeds #10m, against a third two years ago. These steps will not
improve results straight away as profits will be taken after completion.
The half-owned facilities management business is apparently doing
well, earning #13m in its first year and an improvement is anticipated
in the current period.

JUST a few weeks ago all right-thinking people were horrified by the
child murders in north Wales and Merseyside and questions were asked
about what sort of sick society we were living in that such events could
occur. Similar questions could be asked about our treatment of the
elderly.
Last week came news of an investigation into the circumstances
surrounding the death of a 75-year-old man whose Glasgow home had been
boarded up by workmen. Then earlier this week came the horrific news
that a 93-year-old widow had been raped in a churchyard while tending
her husband's grave. The lot of the elderly in the UK seems an
increasingly bleak one.
Personally, I hope I die before I become old and dependent on the
state. A recent visit to a 93-year-old lady in an NHS hospital's Elderly
Care Ward was deeply upsetting. The word Care in the ward title was a
bit of a misnomer given that there was little sign of any staff in the
vicinity of the ward. The patients were either lying in bed or sitting
in chairs by their beds staring blankly into space. It did not appear to
be the most conducive environment for making a rapid recovery. A large
part of the problem is that many of these people should not be in
hospital. They are old as opposed to ill.
Knowing that this is what I might have to look forward to is a
sobering thought. Many of these elderly people, predominantly women,
were in hospital awaiting a place in a residential nursing home.
Obsession with budgets rather than what is in the best interests of
individuals means that many social service departments are happy to
delay the paperwork for as long as possible so that the NHS, ie, the
taxpayer, picks up the tab. This is particularly the case towards the
end of the fiscal year. As a result, nursing homes are taking in older,
more dependent people and so the average stay in a nursing home has
dropped to little more than one year.
Hospital is the wrong place for the frail elderly, of which there are
a growing number. Properly regulated, privately run residential
facilities are the answer. They are better able to provide a
cost-effective service tailored to the needs both medical and
recreational of such people.
There appears to be no dignity associated with old age in the UK. What
is striking when you see a group of elderly people in either a hospital
or home is how they are all pushed together irrespective of individual
circumstance. In their younger lives these people must have had a wide
diversity of occupations, interests etc, but once you become old and
dependent you are suddenly all deemed to be the same. People you
probably would never have come across in your youth suddenly become your
room mate, although thankfully private nursing home operators are
providing an increasing number of single rooms. Is it any wonder that
people want to stay in their own homes as long as possible or would
rather die than go into a home?
Politicians like to make gestures from their respective viewpoints but
what is needed is a coordinated programme aimed at tackling the issue of
caring for the elderly. The proportion of the UK population aged 85 and
over is expected to rise from just over one million to 2.4m by the year
2011. Almost one-third of the over-85s are in some form of institutional
care.
There is insufficient money to put into the NHS that would be of
lasting benefit. What cash is available would be better spent by the
local community care organisations which could draw up an individual
care plan for the elderly using the resources of both the state and the
private sector in much the same way as happens with the provision of
special needs education for children.
There are rumours of big changes for the pensions industry in this
year's Budget, with the possibility that we may be able to pay premiums
for long-term care insurance out of pension funds. This would obviate
the need for many elderly people to sell their homes to pay for their
care, thus depriving their children of part of their inheritance.
It's not before time that something is being done to help the current
elderly population. Many of them who lived through the war and witnessed
the introduction of the modern welfare state will have assumed that the
state will look after them. I am under no such illusions about what will
be on offer from the state when and if I get old. However, I am probaly
not alone in not saving enough towards my pension and long-term
healthcare. At an average cost of about #300 per week, nursing homes do
not come cheap. It may be difficult but it is becoming increasingly
necessary to balance the spending needs of today with provision for
later years.

YOU could bottle the irony. It's as though the Medellin cartel has
decided to reposition its brand by buying TV advertising just as police
are kicking in doors in pursuit of mulled wine pushers. Meanwhile, a
Government Minister is heard demanding random tests of prisoners who
might have let the odd Benedictine pass their lips, while health
education groups concede that honest dope conglomerates just want to
increase their share of a tough market . . .
Only a couple of stiff drinks separate truth from fantasy. Last Friday
night United Distillers began to run TV ads for Bell's (absolutely no
relation) whisky in an effort to win back young drinkers. Meanwhile,
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth was ordering mandatory drug tests for
prisoners -- with penalties for those who fail or refuse the offer --
and Strathclyde Police were launching yet another ''crackdown'' on
narcotics dealers.
A crackdown, for those unfamiliar with the journalese, involves police
doing what they always do, only more so, and making a lot more noise
about it. In this, it is not so very different from an advertising
campaign, save that the police don't have to pay for the publicity and
generally get more column inches. United Distillers must be sick with
envy.
But Scotland does have a drug problem. So has the rest of Britain. So
has almost every country in the world with nothing better to worry
about, not least those who favour punitive measures against anyone who
refuses to content themselves with volatile intoxicating liquids as a
handy agent of self-destruction. Wherever public health and leisure meet
and governments need a scapegoat for problems they would rather not
tackle, Demon Dope is called to account.
Forsyth is held to be at the leading edge of Tory thinking. Consider
his scheme, therefore. At a time when the Scottish Prison Service is
under orders to cut costs by 10% -- and while prison numbers are about
to rise by 10% -- the Minister has developed a taste for urine samples,
sniffer dogs, and closed-circuit television with the stated aim of
testing 10% of prisoners each year. The arithmetic, if not the thinking,
is almost laughably neat.
Yet there remain one or two questions about the drug nightmare (the
language is catching) which Ministers tend not to raise. Why is it, for
example, that the worst examples of addiction and drug-related crime
tend to be class specific, characteristic of areas in which the housing
stinks, jobs are few, and hopes, if they are raised at all, invariably
slight? Why, in other words, are so many junkies dirt poor? Why,
equally, is nothing ever said about the importance of narcotics to the
British economy? Would this sully the high moral tone?
Yet where are we supposed to imagine the money from pathetic addicts
goes, if not into well-laundered investments in perfectly respectable
businesses, each part of the great entrepreneurial tide that will, any
day now, make Britain great again? Imagine the furore if someone could
put a figure on the number of jobs, law-enforcement aside, which depend
indirectly on the heroin trade.
While we are at it, we may as well ask again just how successful any
government attack on recreational habits has ever been. People are
stubborn about fun and chemical relief. They tend to believe that a
thing banned is a thing greatly to be desired. There is absolutely no
evidence that when they vote with their appetites there is very much, if
anything, the law can do.
Witness America's endless and fruitless efforts.
Finally we might ask ourselves what, law and custom aside, really
separates legally available intoxicants and the illegal ones peddled by
the Medellin cartel. Cocaine is deplorable, of course, but is only
rarely the cause of domestic violence, football riots, road accidents,
or cirrhosis of the liver. Alcohol is a commodity whose mostly-mythical
virtues are far outweighed by its addictive qualities and toxic effects,
yet the copywriters think only to mention ''quality'' and
''refinement''. Can we envisage a slogan here: Say No to Coke -- Have a
Large One? Best leave that to the professionals.
Launching the ad campaign for Scotland, Ireland, and the North of
England last week, a spokesman for Bell's said he thought people would
be ''surprised'' to discover that the product being plugged is Scotch.
Younger people -- not, heaven forbid, young people -- were simply being
asked to ''think again'' about the drink. They are being softened up, in
other words, for the hard stuff.
After all, we know from government campaigns how easy it is to
graduate from soft drugs to hard ones. All those 25-year-olds who
imagined they were quite happy with a dry white wine and a bag of
cashews are about to discover how very wrong -- and utterly bereft of
cool -- they were. This vital process of education is, needless to say,
perfectly legal.
SUCH hypocrisy is old news, not least given the staggering amount of
revenue the Exchequer collects with each bottle of hooch. A cut of 70%
is beyond the dreams of your average hash peddler, after all.
Nevertheless, it might be instructive for those concerned with public
health to ask young users of the lesser narcotics why they long ago said
''No'' to spirits. They regard it as a stupid vice, apparently.
Amid all this, you will be pleased to hear, Michael Forsyth believes
that drug-taking prisoners need ''support'' (to be available, one
assumes, right after the strip searches and the punishments). No-one
knows what he means by this, or how much money he intends to put into
rehabilitation. Meanwhile, we look forward to that first, sobering
prison riot.
Cheers, afore ye go right off the idea, Minister.

THE pub quiz is a serious business. And no serious pub quizzer should
be without a book called How to Win Any Pub Quiz (Guinness, #7.99).
It contains such vital information as who is the Greek god of soil and
agriculture (Demeter) and what is the national airline of Venezuela
(Viasa). What it doesn't contain is the answer to what is the national
airline of Romania, a question which came up in the quiz at the Doublet
Bar in Glasgow the other night at which the Diary was in attendance.
(The answer is Tarom and, since you ask, we got the answer right.)
Pub quizzes are great sources of entertainment, heated debate, tumult,
and controversy. Best of all they give you an excuse to be in the pub
and not at home watching the telly.
The pub quiz also offers the opportunity for nefarious behaviour, or
cheating as it is better known. The Doublet has a well-known and avid
quiz participant whose technique is to earwig on the proceedings, find
out the likely answers, and pass these on, on a consultancy basis, in
return for the odd free drink.
Not for nothing is he now known as The Quizling.
John Smith, author of the aforementioned book, is the great
philosopher of the pub quiz world. Among his many handy hints is: ''Try
not to upset question masters, no matter how vague or dim-witted they
may appear. They will always get you back.'' It is also worth bearing in
mind that the question master will also, most likely, be the chap
marking your answers. Unless he is also the pub owner, buy him a drink.
Mr Smith advises would-be quiz winners: ''Keep fully abreast of
current affairs, the names of tinpot dictators and ministerial
mistresses are a favourite source for questions.'' Don't be a snob about
soap operas, he adds, and always make a note of the breed of the supreme
champion at Crufts.
His book is a treasure trove of information such as who was the only
British Prime Minister to be assassinated (Spencer Perceval, of course,
in 1812) and what was the advertising slogan of Players cigarettes
(''It's the tobacco that counts'').
We have a few free copies of this quizzers' bible to pass on, but only
to those who are prepared to tell us about the nefarious practices they
have observed in their pub competitions.
Court report
PRIZE for not mincing words goes today to Tommy Sheridan, the Militant
Labour councillor in Glasgow. Mr Sheridan, pursuing his campaign of
solidarity for those who find sheriff officers knocking on the door for
unpaid poll tax debts, recently earned himself 30 days at Greenock
Sheriff Court for a spot of civil disobedience.
Tommy is out on appeal -- an appeal which, we fear, will not be helped
by his own account of the trial in the Scottish Militant Labour
newsletter. he reports that he and his colleagues ''were sentenced by an
obnoxious, ignorant, and unelected sheriff'' who, just to emphasise the
point, is described as ''a pompous ass''.
A Fanny think
happened . . .
IT is not quite in the same class as Bill Tennent's ''I hope all your
doughnuts turn out like Fanny's'', but Scottish TV's Angus Simpson is
doing his best. Given the task on the lunchtime show of thanking chef
George Quar for his ''hints and tips'' he thanked him for his ''hinps
and tits''.
A nice touch
DARLINDA, the Sunday Mail astrologer, died yesterday and all over
Scotland people wondered aloud whether she knew it was coming. Darlinda,
or Rita as her friends knew her, knew they would say that. She had a
great sense of humour and a capacity for coping with jokes about her
profession.
The truth is that Rita lived with a knowledge of her impending death,
suffering as she did from an intractable kidney illness.
She simply got on with her work, got on with the task of raising tens
of thousands of pounds for renal failure charities, and got on with her
painting, entertaining, enjoying life, and touching the lives of most
people who met her.
I am slightly biased about Rita since the time when she saw me
hobbling, stricken with gout, across the Caprese restaurant in Glasgow
and ordered me to go to see her husband, Rajan Madhok, a specialist in
the field.
She must have foreseen how Raj was going to help me. And it was a nice
touch. Not many people can claim they were referred to their gout
specialist by an astrologer.
China syndrome
IT is totally incorrect politically to pass on this comment but a
Diary acquaintance who should know better opines that with the
international women's conference in Beijing there are currently so many
dykes in China that they're overshadowing the Great Wall.
Man about the house
FROM America we receive information about an item which may be of
interest to ladies of a nervous disposition. It is called Safe-T-Man:
Your Personal Bodyguard. He is a ''life-sized simulated male'' designed
to give potential attackers the impression that you have ''the
protection of a male guardian at home alone or driving in the car''.
How many muggers would be scared of a six-foot Ken doll is open to
question, but never mind. This ''unique security product comes in a
variety of skin tones, with airbrushed facial highlights'' -- actually
painted stubble which gives the impression that he has been dooking for
fag ends.
When Safe-T-Man is not needed, he can be easily folded up and carried
in the optional carrying bag. The inanimate bodyguard comes in at
$99.95. And for those of you interested in perfecting the illusion,
Safe-T-Man also comes with button-on legs at an extra $19.95.

JOHN GREENLEES'S recent article on ''Japan's special debt to
Scotland'' represents a superficial and illusory vision of Scotland and
its ''Japanese connection''. It is also both condescending and grossly
misleading because of the false expectations it could raise on the part
of those looking at Japan for business, or the complacency it might
engender in others.
Professor Masami Kita of Soka University has researched and written
extensively on the nineteenth-century influences that Scotland exerted
on Japan's early modernisation. But it has to be seen in the context of
the multitude of things Japan imported from all over the world. What
links exist between Japan and Scotland today bear no relation to the
events of a century ago.
Four simple points should make this clear. First, to the Japanese, as
to many outsiders, Scotland is an ''acquired taste''. Consider the case
of the hallowed sport. Golf in Japan is US-style, with manicured
courses, showers, restaurants, and high standards of service. No need to
share the course with grazing sheep. Many have tried to attract Japanese
tour groups to Scotland to play golf. No-one has succeeded. Hawaii and
Australia are preferred.
The Shi-Tenno Buddhist Temple of Osaka has built a Japanese-style golf
course at Donnington, near Newbury. Unbelievers should go to see what is
expected. I doubt if anyone in Scotland would be willing to invest the
capital required to reach the expected standards.
Secondly, regarding investment in Scotland, Mr Greenlees gives the
impression (often found among those who believe in the existence of
Brigadoon) that Scotland attracts because it is Scotland (the ''Here's
tae us'' syndrome). Japanese factories are here for economic reasons,
and because the case has been painstakingly presented for investment.
Scotland has been well served by many unsung heroes in the form of
overseas representatives, official and unofficial, who have charmed and
cajoled foreign capital for years. Japan faces a daily queue of a
hundred nations seeking investment. China is now top of the list, which
means, in effect, that the major phase of Japanese investment in Europe
is over. Korea will be next, for those interested.
Thirdly, on Scottish products as exports, I can state that four years
ago I capitalised a new import business in Japan, after working as trade
development adviser in the Japan Airlines group. I wanted to see how
difficult it really was. I was fed up hearing about wonderful trade
fairs, that our products sold because they were Scottish, and then
looking at the actual miserable results. My staff are Japanese, and even
they find the market complex and daunting. They are in competition with
the products of the whole United Nations, let alone Japanese domestic
products, and they have to fight for every little niche. Importing into
Japan is a war of attrition.
Fourthly, and this is not intended as a political statement (although
it will be highly unpalatable to some), the plain truth is that Scotland
is well received in Japan because it is part of the UK. The people he
met were obviously prepared for Mr Greenlees, but I bet they had to pull
out the atlas! The UK is colloquially referred to in Japanese as Igirsu,
which about says it all. The subtle constitutional provisions of 1707
are lost on the Japanese (and on the Chinese too, for that matter).
Scotland is about the size of one Japanese prefecture, just as Japan is
the size of one Chinese province. In the age of the Pacific, a little
European Scotland would be classed alongside Moldavia or Malta, if at
all.
Finally, the article is full of errors. Japan has only one science
Nobel Prize on record. Yukawa for Physics. Tonegawa was working from the
US. There are not ''thousands of Scots'' in Tokyo and elsewhere. I'd be
surprised if there are 1000 nationwide. The number of foreign residents
is actually decreasing because of costs. The pub in Shibuya is called
''1066'', not very Scottish (although there is the Malt House
''Bowmore'' in Azabu).
There have been Highland games in Kobe, not Kyoto, twice in recent
years, and in Tokyo this year the 13th will take place. The St Andrew
Society of Yokohama and Tokyo is not a branch of anything. It is a
society of Scots founded around 1870, the oldest loyal society in Japan
and the first foreign society formed after Japan's Meiji Restoration,
and has a membership of just over 100, many of whom are Japanese
associate members. There is also the Japan-Scotland Society founded a
decade ago by a Japanese group, which works closely with the St Andrew
Society in Tokyo and the sister society in Kobe.
Last but not least, pilot Japanese courses in Japanese language were
started at two schools in 1986 with support from Yamaichi Shoken. Thanks
to Oliver Maclachlan, headmaster of Balwearie High School in Kirkcaldy,
a real attempt was made at that level. At that time also the Parker
Report on ''minority languages'' was considering the status of Japanese.
While I would agree that knowledge of Japan should be added into school
curricula, it is a belated and limited vision that lies behind the
appeal. If Scotland as Scotland, or part of the UK or the EU, is to be
represented within the economic movements of the next century, Pacific
Rim Studies should receive serious attention.

LIKE most of the recent correspondence relating to John Macleod Dr
Finlay MacLeod's letter is rich in insult and bankrupt in argument
(September 6). It is obviously far easier to shout that he is sick,
arrogant, repressed, and raving mad than to refute his opinions.
Dr MacLeod does, however, introduce one new element into the
discussion: the reason that John Macleod is a lunatic is that his father
failed to give him proper counsel.
On such matters I have some expertise. The counsel I gave John was
clear enough: hold your convictions firmly, express them clearly, extend
the same liberty to others, and expect them to make full use of it.
The ''chilling'' fact to emerge from such correspondence is not that
John Macleod is a sick child who had no chance in life because his
father suffered from syphilis (sorry, Calvinism), but that the Gay Lobby
and the Liberal Establishment now feel sufficiently strong to make a bid
for press censorship.
It is absolutely outrageous, they think, that a newspaper should
publish views out of keeping with their own. Indeed, if The Herald had
#1000 for every letter asking it to sack this particular journalist it
could buy out every newspaper in Britain.
He has become to gays, Humanists, and most of his fellow journalists
what Salman Rushdie is to Muslims. If he serves no other purpose in life
his experience does at least highlight the kind of world we shall all be
living in when the hegemony passes to Dr MacLeod and his associates.
Dr MacLeod himself quotes the dictum of his co-religionist, Iain
Crichton Smith: ''It is time to turn the blow-lamp on dogma!'' Is this
not itself dogma? And is it not also a threat? These men cannot wait to
get their hands on the blow-lamp and once they have it they will
liquidate all who refuse to worship at the shrine of their own confused
post-modernism. Getting John Macleod sacked would be a good start.
The Doctor also makes a semi-kindly reference to what I have suffered
at the hands of some of my co-religionists. But will I be safer when
power passes to the leaders of the Gaelic renaissance? Bigots are bigots
whatever their theology.
It is plausible, too, to suggest a psychological reason for John's
condition (the condition being, of course, that he thinks it perfectly
natural to exercise free speech on the subject of homosexuality). Such
rantings, says Dr MacLeod, ''are usually associated with the turmoil of
an unconscious mind which dreads and hates elements of itself''.
What balderdash! ''Associated'': by whom? ''Usually'': so there are
exceptions? How convenient that all who disagree with us are insane!
Besides, such psychological determinism is a double-edged sword. If
John Macleod's Calvinism is the result of tortuous rumblings in the
depths of his unconscious may the same not be true of Finlay MacLeod's
paranoid hostility to the religion of his community? Do our bellies
explain everything?
There is nothing I would welcome more cordially than public debate on
the impact of Calvinism on Scotland. Unfortunately, our Gaelic
intellectuals are interested only in talking to each other.
I believe them to be wrong in every aspect of their thesis: wrong in
their definition of Calvinism; wrong in their belief that it once
dominated Scotland; wrong in their claim that it destroyed Gaelic
culture; and wrong in their assessment of its current strength and
future prospects.
Besides, it is malice, not intelligence, which describes me as
sprending my life scrabbling among the footnotes of Calvinism. At the
moment I spend my time tracing the development of Anglican Unitarianism,
exploring the Scottish relevance of Liberation Theology, and having
apoplexy over the fact that Walter Smith won't give Ian Durrant an
extended run in his Rangers' line-up.
No son of mine will ever turn the blow-lamp on homosexuals,
psychologists, Tories, or Skye-men. Can he and I have a similar
guarantee from the Scottish Establshment?

THERE is no need for Ronald Mavor to write so disparagingly of John
Macleod (September 4). In the article referred to, John Macleod
acknowledges the universality of sin and the need for grace and
forgiveness. He would, I am sure, acknowledge his own need of God's
grace in Jesus and would wish all to avail themselves of it.

OF furious writings against your talented journalist John Macleod
there appears to be no end. Stuart J Mitchell (September 5) even tries
to get us quaking in our boots about a worldwide ''fundamentalist
menace'' which we allegedly face on all fronts (not least from John
Macleod ''and his sort'').
Few would dispute the ''fundamentalist'' epithet when applied to
suicide bombers from the West Bank. But does language retain any meaning
if we use the same term to describe Christians in this country whose
only ''crime'' is to take the scriptures seriously as their source of
authority in matters of faith and life?
Stewart Lamont in his Saturday Herald column has evidently come to
realise that ''conservative evangelical'' is a more appropriate term
than ''fundamentalist'' in describing the many within the Kirk who are
happy to hold to the traditional view of the Bible.
Perhaps Stuart Mitchell could learn from this, and be more
discriminating in his use of this particular f-word.
While he's at it, he could ponder the logic of criticising John
Macleod for the apparently unforgiveable crime of thinking he is
''right'' -- and then going on himself to pronounce upon so-called
Christian fundamentalism as ''just plain wrong''. Moreover, a
long-refuted liberal theologian of whom few readers have probably heard
is deemed to be, you guessed it, ''right''.
Are there absolutes or aren't there, Mr Mitchell? And who is it who
really ''brooks no contrary views to his own''?

I'M puzzled by the article on ''Higher still'' (August 29). We're
told, ''the reform is being introduced because the present system of
Highers is beyond the reach of a large percentage of the growing number
of young people staying on after 16''. But this is exactly what the
present Highers are meant for; to sort out those who are capable of
going on to higher education at the universities and those who are not.
For the ''large percentage'' there is a perfectly suitable alternative
at the moment: the Scotvec exams which cover a large number of
disciplines and are well within the capabilities of all but the insane.
So what is ''Higher Still''? Scotvec under another name? Is it called
''Higher Still'' because it will still be Scotvec, somehow raised in
public consciousness by the academic name, ''Higher''? Call a midden a
rose and it will smell like one?
Or does ''Higher Still'' mean a motionless, unprogressive Higher
because it is not going to lead anywhere, certainly not to Advanced
Highers since that will be only for the minority who can tackle the
present Highers?
Or does the ''still'' refer to a fermentation process by which a
non-academic pupil will believe, presumably by imbibing, that he is
still really a Higher pupil?

STUART J Mitchell (September 5) expresses contempt for a
fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible and lists recent scenes of
religious hatred from around this planet in an attempt to strengthen his
case.
Fundamentalist Christianity has nothing to do with acts of terror from
perpetrators who claim divine inspiration for their inhuman acts.
Christians who accept the Bible as a source of absolute truth do so
because they sincerely believe that this is how God has revealed himself
to us, not because they have any particular desire to be controversial
or antagonistic to the world at large.
Much of this country's population are tolerant of every religious
doctrine as long as it does not claim to be the only revealed truth. But
a close examination of the Bible will reveal that Jesus himself claimed
to be ''the way''. Are we then to disregard the words of Jesus in order
to be more socially acceptable?
Mr Mitchell expresses his opinion that ''Christian fundamentalism is
quite simply wrong.'' He is entitled to his belief, but appers only to
be tolerant of anyone else as long as they agree with him.

YOUR front-page report about the Burns International Festival
suggested that the bicentenary fund set up by Dumfries and Galloway
Regional Council was some form of contingency measure reflecting concern
about the International Festival (August 23).
The fact is that the regional council believes the Burns International
Festival will be a great success and our aim in creating a separate
bicentenary fund is to capitalise on that success by supporting small
local projects which fall outwith the remit of the main festival.
Here in the South-west the build up to bicentenary year is well under
way, and the broad and imaginative programme put together by the
festival director, John Struthers, and the board of the festival company
will be a worthy reflection of our pride in Scotland's national poet.

MICHAEL Fry's article, Adman's Scotland heads for a fall (August 30),
is very true in parts. However, I feel some points need clarification.
Journalism is perhaps like cooking -- we cannot please everyone all of
the time. He is correct in saying Scotland should concentrate on the
quality end of the market as we by and large are a quality destination.
We have quality in our countryside, our golf, other sporting interests,
hotels and produce. Where we fall down is in our cooking, as Michael Fry
says.
I disagree, however, with his attack on the Scottish Tourist Board and
Taste of Scotland. I may not have done so in the past but I genuinely
believe changes in both organisations could set in motion a general
raising of standards in cooking at all levels in our country.
Taking the tourist board, my impression is that the new chief
executive is prepared to listen to those in the industry who have, to
quote Michael Fry, ''shown commitment rather than gimmicks'' -- time
will tell. Taste of Scotland has moved on from the whisky and haggis
image and could be, under the new regime, a force in raising the quality
level.
Scotland has no food culture -- we do have wonderful produce but not
enough indigenous Scots interested in dining out. Everyone talks about
the improvements there have been -- however, there is still a long way
to go.
It's not price. We need more discerning diners in Scotland, we need
better cooking at all levels using the wonderful produce we have, we
need training, and we need a Government, of any colour, prepared to
recognise this is an important issue as well as a major industry.
A nation's culture has to be changed. It will take a long time. It
will need the co-operation of private and public sectors, also support
from all lovers of good cooking, and I know Michael Fry is one.

YOUR leader comment on September 1, A service in decline, needs to be
balanced by a recognition of the achievements of the NHS in Tayside.
There is abundant evidence and public recognition that many of the
services provided by Dundee Teaching Hospitals, including both
haematology and renal medicine, are much better than they were only a
few years ago. Our staff are justifiably proud of these achievements.
The situation which prevails within haematology/renal beds at
Ninewells Hospital is indeed causing concern. However, no patients have
been deprived of essential treatment despite the compromise over
bed-boarding. These sustained pressures have now dictated that a more
radical solution must be found earlier than previously planned.
A major improvement involving separation of the two services would
require capital funding from the Scottish Office and would have major
recurring revenue implications for Tayside Health Board.
The trust expects to be able to include an indicative figure for the
necessary capital in its forthcoming business plan submission to the
Scottish Office for 1996-97. It will be discussing the service quality
and revenue issues with Tayside Health Board as a matter of priority.
The essential steps identified by the trust as necessary to effect a
satisfactory solution still need to be critically reviewed and refined.

NATO'S bombing blitz has left Bosnia's Serbs shaken but not stirred to
the point of compliance with the UN demand that all heavy weapons be
removed beyond shelling range of the surviving safe havens. Now, with
winter only weeks away and the weather already imposing restrictions on
strike missions, the UN must consider upping the ante dramatically in
the short-term to force the Serbs to the negotiating table. The impact
of more than 500 sorties by allied aircraft is more psychological than
real. Fewer than one in 10 of the 300 artillery pieces targeted around
Sarajevo has been destroyed. The onslaught has undoubtedly concentrated
the minds of Serb politicians. After three years of feeble, pinprick
retaliation for their worst excesses, they had not expected such a
degree of resolution or forcible response. Unfortunately, the use of
NATO's potentially overwhelming aerial might has served only to
strengthen the determination of Serb military commanders to play for
time, absorbing the inevitable blows while they shuffle their forces
around the mountains and pray for the protection of cloud cover.
The Western powers have their own problems. The weather window is
closing fast. Footage from the Italian air bases from which the majority
of the raids are mounted show increasing numbers of fighter bombers
returning from aborted missions with their high-explosive payloads
undelivered. In the interest of minimising ''collateral damage''
(NATO-speak for civilian casualties), pilots are forbidden to release
their weapons unless targets are clearly visible. A key priority is
avoidance of any propaganda victory for the wily Serbs in the form of
dead children or bomb-shattered hospitals. NATO also remains woefully
short of specialist aircraft equipped with the electronic hardware
necessary for decoying, jamming, or destroying the Serbs' unexpectedly
sophisticated air defence network. Only a small part of this system has
so far been attacked and put out of action. Learning from Iraqi errors
in the Gulf War, the Serbs have not switched on, and thus exposed to
detection, the air defence radars used to pinpoint attacking war planes.
Such radars and their accompanying SAM missiles remain a potent threat
throughout much of western and central Bosnia. General Mladic, the Serb
commander, also has an estimated 800 artillery pieces and heavy mortars
still at his disposal. All are mobile and relatively easily concealed.
The fire power they represent has been his prime advantage over his more
numerous but less well equipped Muslim and Croat enemies. Without them,
his 80,000 men would be outnumbered almost 2-1 and risk decisive defeat
along overstretched front lines.
The UN's dilemma is that its air campaign must be seen to work quickly
if it is to preserve credibility and maintain any hope of brokering a
peaceful settlement. At the same time it cannot weaken the Serbs
militarily to the point where Serb territory would be vulnerable to a
Muslim offensive. The name of the game is not making war on the Serbs to
the benefit of their enemies. The obvious solution is a new,
concentrated wave of strikes massing all available air defence
suppression assets in a crushing blow aimed at crippling Serb missile
batteries. Substantial attrition of artillery and armour would also be
desirable without leaving the Serbs totally defenceless. Targeting
policy has already been widened from the immediate environs of Sarajevo
to communications centres, supply dumps, and munitions plants throughout
Bosnia. Selection of these targets has been designed deliberately to
keep the human cost low. However, the time may now have arrived for the
next logical step, the adding of Mladic and his staff to the hit list.
If the Serb high command is the single main barrier to negotiation, then
it is a logjam which could be cleared by a single surgical strike. Few
tears would be shed for the Butcher of Bosnia and the peace process
might then stand a chance of success.

I COMMEND Bernie Zonfrillo for his excellent work on Ailsa Craig in
ridding the rock of the rats and for extending his good work and
expertise to the Faroes (August 28).
However, the article does a disservice to his predecessors in such
ventures when claiming that his recent exercise on the Craig was the
first such project ever undertaken in the northern hemisphere.
In the November 1979 issue of the Scottish Field, Duncan MacDonald
writes, ''In 1923 I persuaded the Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds to start a campaign to stamp out the rats . . . The idea was to
save the puffins who nest in a burrow and are easy prey.
'' . . . Poison, used outside the nesting season, cost #250 and the
results seemed most satisfying.''
Sadly Mr MacDonald's efforts did not kill all the rats. It is to be
hoped that Bernie Zonfrillo has been more successful. However, Duncan
MacDonald does deserve the credit for initiating just such a project 72
years ago.

WE sympathise with Mr Geoffrey Minter, the man who has the unenviable
task of producing good news about Caithness when the core of the
Caithness economy, and to some extent the image of the county, is
represented by the Dounreay nuclear plant and all its works. Caithness
is a dramatic and wonderful place. It is not for agoraphobics for it is
the epitome of the wide and open outdoors, but it has at its heart a
canker in the form of the nuclear plant which has skewed the local
economy, done little to encourage meaningful and diverse industrial
development, and wrought untold harm to a tourist industry which could
have delivered significant prosperity. It is brave and sensible for Mr
Minter and his colleagues to have banded together to promote the
positive aspects of Caithness, but he cannot wave a magic wand and make
Dounreay go away. Nor can he prevent British government agencies from
talking arrant nonsense and making his task even more difficult. The
core of the present problem is the Government's Industrial Pollution
Inspectorate, an august body which has great confidence in its own
analyses but which has never managed to connect meaningfully with the
wider public.
Amazingly, the pollution inspectorate objected to the installation of
the Osprey wave generator in the Pentland Firth near Dounreay while a
major search was being conducted for radioactive particles which had
somehow found their way out of Dounreay and on to the foreshore. Having
objected to Osprey, which promptly sank, the pollution inspectorate now
seems to have no objection to the reprocessing of more foreign nuclear
waste at Dounreay. Given Dounreay's record this appears a little
puzzling, but the pollution inspectors are ready with an explanation.
They believe that there is no reason to object to reprocessing because
the already errant radioactive particles are insignificant. Why? Because
there was little risk of anyone coming into contact with them; therefore
there was virtually no risk involved.
It is sensible to point out that other authorities, including the
UKAEA Safety Directorate, believe that the radiation dose-rates from the
particles on the foreshore are substantial. Nor does the pollution
inspectorate, the Dounreay management, or even the unfortunate Mr Minter
have the slightest idea of whether anyone is at risk of coming into
contact with the particles. They found their way out of Dounreay and on
to the foreshore; could they find their way further? It is the duty of
the Industrial Pollution Directorate to weigh up the risk and come to a
judicious decision. It must not be influenced by the Government's
earnest desire to start reprocessing at Dounreay on a grand scale,
including the importation of nuclear waste for treatment from all around
the world. Nor do we suggest that it has been so influenced. Its
judgment, though, does seem a little odd. It will be of great help to
the nuclear industry, to Dounreay, and perhaps ultimately to the
Exchequer. It will be no help at all to Mr Minter or to the people of
Caithness who have been burdened enough by Dounreay.

Filmhouse, Edinburgh from Monday
EAGERLY awaited by devotees of Delicatessen, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and
Marc Caro's fantasy about lost innocence and childhood nightmares, The
City of Lost Children, the most expensive film ever made in France,
proves worth the wait. A dazzling fantasy bursting with invention, it
draws on everyone from Jules Verne to Charles Dickens and the Brothers
Grimm and is refreshingly free from the sentimentality which tends to
overwhelm American fantasy.
Krank, a crazy inventor (Daniel Emilfork), who lives on an oil rig in
the middle of a minefield, is ageing prematurely because he cannot
dream. His solution -- kidnapping children and stealing their dreams. A
circus strong-man, One (Ron Perlman), and Miette (Judith Vittet), an
orphan pickpocket, go to the rescue of Denree (Joseph Lucien), One's
friend.
They encounter a talking brain, one-eyed monsters, six clones
(Domonique Pinon) who guard Krank, diabolic Siamese twin sisters, and an
amazing flea which injects its victims with poison. It is a world of
mist and rotting brick, of continual danger and unwelcome surprises.
Adults will probably be more scared by it than children, because it
will bring back those half-forgotten nightmares of childhood. Children,
who still dream them, will recognise this scary world as one they
inhabit.
In Dolores Claiborne Kathy Bates plays the title role of a woman
acquitted years before of killing her husband who is now suspected of
murdering the rich old woman she worked for, and no wonder. The postman
found her standing with a rolling pin over the old woman's body at the
foot of the stairs down which she had apparently been pushed.
Based on a Stephen King story, the film, which should have been a
really superior psychological thriller, suffers from having been
expanded to accommodate two leading ladies and ends up better than run
of the mill, but not much more.
Jennifer Jason Leigh, in an unbecoming black wig, plays Dolores's
estranged daughter who returns to the remote New England island
community where she was brought up after a 15-year absence when she
learns of the accusations made against her mother. Somebody has faxed
her the news. The trouble is Jason Leigh, who is extremely talented, has
been given a cliche role -- that of the magazine reporter who has
interviewed just about everybody, slept with her editor and is screaming
to be sent on some big story which will make a book and win her a
Pulitzer prize.
There is no need for such detail. It is just laziness on the part of
the scriptwriter because she could as easily have been a school teacher,
a secretary or a topless model. All we need to know is she has been away
for a long time, is reasonably well off and intelligent, and for some
reason does not get on with her mother
Their meeting is fraught, and mother and daughter strike sparks off
one another most satisfyingly, both formidable actresses being on top
form. Unluckily for Jason Leigh, because she has been given the
better-written role, Bates wins hands down.
It turns out there is a dark secret in the past which is eventually
revealed through a series of flashbacks. Judy Parfitt turns in a neat
cameo as the rich-bitch employer who is not as bad as she is painted,
and Christopher Plummer adds some menace as the policeman due to retire
who wants to nail Bates for murder since he is convinced she did kill
her husband all those years ago.
The normally nice David Strathairn makes Mr Claiborne, an alcoholic
who batters his wife, a thoroughly nasty bit of work who clearly
deserved to die. The New England locations are refreshingly different,
but the film is far too long and the final tying up of loose ends is
ridiculous.
It is one of those films in which the product placement is blatant. In
one scene a bottle of Black and White Scotch is plonked on a table slap
bang in front of the camera sitting there so long in focus one can read
the endorsement -- Made in Scotland.
At least it is the real thing, which is more than one can say for
Braveheart. Bloodied, but unbowed, I still believe the complicated issue
of Scottish independence and the emergence of our national identity
requires a far more honest approach. Contemporary ideas about
nationalism and modern motivations cannot be used to explain the
behaviour of thirteenth-century people.
Wallace's image is encrusted enough in myth without having a shallow
Hollywood veneer superimposed. The battles and Mel Gibson are
spectacular, and it is a well-photographed and performed epic. Had it
been about Robin Hood, the dramatic liberties would not matter. But they
do. I have read James Mackay's book, as it happens, and this is not the
film of the book. Whatever happened to Stirling bridge, by the way? The
Battle of Stirling (sic) takes place without one. More than the English
have hammered Scotland.
Screwball comedies are rare, if not extinct these days. Hold Me,
Thrill Me, Kiss Me, a first feature written and directed by Joel
Hershman boldly attempts to revive the genre. An impressive cast
includes Sean Young and the lady who wowed the Edinburgh Film festival,
Diane Ladd.
Eli (Max Parrish) is forced by his girlfriend, rich, blonde and a
bitch (Ms Young), to marry her after she finds him commiting larceny in
her parents' home -- she holds a gun to his head. But Eli has other
ideas, the gun goes off, and complications ensue which end with Twinkle
out of the way and Eli, now called Bud, heading for Rio with a new
girlfriend, Dannie (Adrienne Shelley). It is wacky and wicked
entertainment.
Latin American cinema is extremely varied and the films on show in
GFT's Latin American Film Festival make rewarding viewing. Two stand
out. In Short Cut to Paradise, directed by Gerardo Herrera, Charles
Dance gives a performance of consummate menace, one of his best, as a
homicidal con-man who gets a job as caretaker at a block of flats with
disastrous results for the other residents.
It is a most superior horror movie. The problem of responsibility for
past atrocities is examined in the Chilean film, Amnesia, directed by
Gonzalo Justiniano.
A conscript forced by his brutal sergeant, years before, to take part
in the killings of political prisoners recognises the old man and, with
one of the men who survived the death squad, decides to bring him to
justice. It is an uncomfortable tale well told. But the whole season is
a reminder of the wealth of film-making talent in Latin America which
does not always get the showing here it deserves, and which this short
festival goes some way to remedying.

Dr DAVID STONE gauges the benefits of various health screens.
THE long-standing debate within the medical profession over the merits
or otherwise of health screens has again flared up, after the reported
comments of a pioneer in the field which seemed to cast doubt on the
value of breast-screening.
You may wonder where the truth lies. Unfortunately, there is no simple
answer.
Screening attempts to advance the clinical horizon so that
asymptomatic diseases or risk factors are diagnosed and treated earlier
rather than later. In theory, this should improve the prospects of
survival for screened individuals suffering from serious but
unrecognised disorders. In practise, the results obtained by screening
are highly variable.
Some forms of total-population screening, notably for a range of
conditions in early childhood and for breast and cervical cancer in
adult women are well established and appear to be effective in reducing
mortality and, in certain cases, in improving the quality of life.
Others -- such as screening for bowel, prostate and skin cancer --
show promise but remain at the experimental stage. A third group,
including screening for coronary risk factors (other than high blood
pressure) in the middle-aged are virtually discredited.
The comprehensive health screen offered by Bupa and other
organisations, in which numerous tests are performed at a single
session, is known as multiphasic screening and represents a special
case.
Curiously, the whole is less than the sum of the parts in that the net
effect of the screen is deeply disappointing even when individual tests
of known efficacy are included, perhaps because the generation of such a
vast quantity of data produces ''information overload'' on both doctor
and patient.
Whatever the explanation, several well-designed studies have
demonstrated no beneficial effects of multiphasic screening on the
health or life expectancy of those screened. Moreover, many patients are
subsequently subjected, quite needlessly, to the inconvenience and
discomfort of expensive and occasionally dangerous diagnostic procedures
which are triggered by positive screen results.
Bupa may argue that some people enjoy this type of screening, hence
the lucrative market for it, but the public should be aware that the
available research evidence fails to support the claim that multiphasic
screening promotes good health.

* IF you are blind or visually impaired how do you cope with everyday
life from reading newspapers and books to working out your electricity
bill? A one-day seminar next Monday in Glasgow aims to explain to both
visually impaired, professionals, and carers just how much help is
available, making people aware of the resources and how to tap into
them.
The seminar and roadshow will take place in the Mitchell Library and
Moir Hall, Charing Cross. Organised by the district libraries and
regional social work departments with the Share the Vision Project, the
roadshow is free but entry to the seminar is #5 for waged and #1
unwaged. Further information from Margaret Wallace, Community Service
Librarian, Mitchell Library, Glasgow. Telephone: 0141 305 2865.
* A SIMPLE urine test could detect whether you are at risk of
osteoporosis.. This promising research comes from the Rowett Research
Institute, Aberdeen, which has pinpointed a substance present in those
who have developed osteoporosis. Both a pilot study and a trial
involving women suffering from osteoporosis are now planned for
Aberdeen.
* TRADITIONAL Chinese medicine is becoming increasingly popular
especially for the treatment of skin problems, conditions notoriously
difficult to treat successfully with orthodox Western medicine. Many
people may be unaware that you can get this treatment in Glasgow. It's
available at the Hui Chun Clinic, 54 Hill Street. Run by W X Chen, who
qualified as a doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine in China, it
offers herbal medicine, acupuncture and TCM massage. For more
information ring: 0141 332 1302.
* IF you are worried about your heart then call the new Freephone
helpline- Heartline 0800 85 85 85 any day between noon and 5pm.
Staffed by nurses experienced in coronary care, it is the first
national telephone service providing confidential information about
heart disease.
* TRENDY therapies are gaining favour over scientific medicine,
especially in the area of back pain. Those using a chiropractor were
found to show a 14% improvement compared to a 11% improvement using
conventional therapy, says a recent report in the British Medical
Journal. It concludes that those who want to attend chiropractors
sometimes find their trip worthwhile.
* EATING soya-bean protein really does reduce your cholesterol level.
A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found the effects were
most marked among those with high cholesterol levels.
* PASSIVE smoking increases the risk of respiratory illness among
young children three-fold, say researchers in the Lancet. Children
exposed to tobacco smoke were identified by the high levels of serum
cotinine in their blood and they were also found to have a high
incidence of respiratory illness.
* ABORTION does not increase your risk of mental illness, unless you
already have such a history, says a recent report in the British Journal
of Psychiatry.
* SMOKERS who think they are reducing their risk of heart disease by
switching to low-tar cigarettes are wasting their time, say researchers
at the Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford. They studied 14,000 survivors of
heart attacks and found no significant difference between those who
smoked high and low-tar cigarettes.
However, they did find that people in their thirties are six times
more likely to have a heart attack than non-smokers. They also found
that those between 40 and 49 were also five times more likely to suffer
an attack.

KATHLEEN RANTELL writes that Scotland's new purpose-designed
homeopathic hospital will have health and architectural benefits for
Glasgow
THE new Homeopathic Hospital for Scotland, to be built in the grounds
of Glasgow's Gartnavel General, will be unique on two counts.
First, the building will forever have a special relationship with
Glasgow's City of Architecture and Design 1999 award. It is the first
project in the city to be announced since the award was won that is to
be the subject of an architectural competition open to all Scottish
practices.
It can be seen therefore as the city's first free confident salute to
the twenty-first century. Mike Hayes, Glasgow's director of planning,
who was manager of the city's bid for the 1999 accolade, believes this
will encourage other developers to arrange open design competitions.
The new building is also unique in that it is the first homeopathic
hospital to be purpose designed. This has given Dr David Taylor Reilly,
director of the present outmoded homeopathic hospital on Great Western
Road, the opportunity for a building that will bring new ideas to
hospital design.
He wants the new hospital to reflect the whole person-care approach of
homeopathy, so that it is a place where harmonious spaces create an
atmosphere of serenity. He is seeking a building that will signal its
healing purposes both externally and internally, and make its own
positive impact on the healing process.
''The quality of the building itself will be fundamental to the care
it provides,'' he says. ''This is a task which will require a very
special architect.'' If that sounds like a challenge, it probably is.
Dedicated people who are hard on themselves look for similar strengths
in everyone else, including those in other disciplines.
Some #2.1m is available for the first phase of the project. The first
prize is #8000 (to be regarded as fees on account) and second and third
prizes will be #5000 and #3000 respectively. Plans, including proposed
landscaping and an estimate of costs, have to be submitted by Friday,
December 1.
The five judges will be: Mike Hayes; Jane Herbert, chief executive of
the West Glasgow Hospitals University NHS Trust; architect David Mackay
who practises in Barcelona, is a visiting professor in the US, and was
involved in the Olympic village; Dr David Reilly; and Christine Wolter,
treasurer of the Friends of Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital, who will
contribute the patients' view. They intend to make their assessments
speedily so the winner will be known before the end of the year.
Everyone concerned is keen for work to start on site by the middle of
1996.
The style of the demands may be new, but the funding follows a
well-worn formula in the homeopathic world. The #2.1m comes from
endowment funds given to the Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital. The money has
accumulated interest over several decades. This follows a pattern of
grateful patients putting something back. The first homeopathic hospital
in Glasgow with 12 beds and four cots opened in 1914 in a house in
Lynedoch Crescent, purchased with a legacy from a Miss Houldsworth of
Ayr.
In 1921 a Mr and Mrs Fyfe made a gift of a Children's Homeopathic
Hospital on the east side of the city which was eventually replaced by
the Baillieston Outpatients' Clinic. When this was threatened with
closure at the end of last year public protests caused Greater Glasgow
Health Board to defer their proposal and the clinic continues to
function.
Early in the thirties, more funds from the Houldsworth family enabled
the city hospital to move into the mansion house in Great Western Road.
Within a year of its opening and with Lynedoch Crescent now an
outpatients' clinic, the chairman of the board called for more funds.
He appealed for #20,000 ''to extend our hospital for the honour of
Glasgow''.
Aspirations grew. A 100-bed hospital -- a 200-bed hospital. Before the
end of the thirties #75,000 had been subscribed to build anew and land
was bought in Julian Avenue, a few hundred yards from the Great Western
Road base. Had the war not intervened the exuberant Art Deco building
proposed -- a sort of super-Odeon spreading its wings -- would surely
have become a listed building, but the perspectives don't demonstrate
the sort of inspiration Dr Reilly has in mind today.
It is easy to see why so much money was collected in the thirties.
Despite the recession many more people were benefiting from the
hospital, says Dr Bernard Leary, treasurer of the Faculty of Homeopaths
in Britain and a medical historian for an overview of Glasgow's place in
the annals. ''There were plenty of homeopathic doctors practising all
over Scotland, many more than now,'' he says. ''From the time homeopathy
was introduced into the UK in the 1830s, Scottish doctors were at the
forefront.
''A lot of Scottish homeopathic doctors came down to England too -- in
the last century Robert Dudgeon -- he was an absolute master -- and
later Sir John Weir who became the first royal homeopathic physician.''
Scottish doctors were prominent among those who carried out research and
increased knowledge about homeopathy.
Among the great researchers in Glasgow, Dr Leary noted John Paterson,
who concentrated on bacteriology -- reading bits of a chatty obituary he
sounded like a latter-day Dr Johnson. Then there was William Boyd with
immunology, and in the late 1970s Drs Robin and Sheila Gibson, who
conducted some of the first accepted double blind trials on allergies
and on rheumatology which helped homeopathy gain some acceptance among
allopathic doctors.
Dr Reilly is also a much-admired researcher and earlier this year won
acceptance with double blind trials on the treatment of hay fever and
asthma. He has done much to build bridges with those who were formally
likely to scoff at his more gentle form of medicine. In the spring more
funds will be needed. The second phase of the new hospital, expected to
cost about #1m, will be mainly used for training, and an appeal will be
made.
''Ever since the 1830s Scottish doctors have been making a great
contribution to the development of homeopathy,'' says Dr Leary, ''and
today Glasgow has become a major centre that is much respected.''

THOM DIBDIN welcomes a play and book which attempt a mature assessment
of the real benefits, risks and pitfalls of the notorious rave drug
IT has taken a while, but the theatre has at last got around to
providing a creditable account of, and commentary on, one of the largest
participatory activities of the decade.
Clubbing came to the Edinburgh Fringe stage with Damage Production's
Come On! At the same time with the publication of Nicholas Saunders's
Ecstasy and the Dance Culture, the fuel for the clubbing explosion, is
being discussed in terms which go beyond knee-jerk condemnation.
Book and play examine different sides of the same coin. Damage looks
at the periphery of clubland: club owners, dealers, and the chill-out
zone, to gain an insight to the whole scene. Saunders documents the
effects, the myths, the uses and the misuses of Ecstasy.
As a self-confessed old hippy, Saunders might seem an unusual person
to be writing about the ''happening'' scene of today. However, his
maturity allows him to provide a perspective which a younger author
might lack.
In 1970, after dropping out of his engineering course in the mid-60s,
he wrote Alternative London -- a guide to the counterculture which had
almost become a mainstream way of life.
''Twenty years later, I have done the same thing for Ecstasy,'' says
Saunders. ''A lot of people are using Ecstasy, yet the myths about it
predominate. Very few people know the real dangers, the real benefits
and the pitfalls to avoid. I have tried to clear all that up by
producing a factual book based on lots of research.''
Saunders first wrote about Ecstasy about two years ago in E for
Ecstasy, a user's guide to the drug. In this new version he has retained
much of the basic information, updated with more research, first-hand
accounts and a wider discussion of the Ecstasy culture.
The most fascinating aspect of the book is his premise that the drug
is not only responsible for the clubbing explosion, but for changing the
attitudes of those who use it.
''I think Ecstasy has affected the whole cultural way of behaving,''
asserts Saunders. ''A very valuable part of what's happening is its
ritual use. It opens people up to each other, something you don't often
see mentioned but which is a very basic aspect of the drug.
''It does seem to break down barriers and open people's hearts to an
extraordinary extent.''
Several of Saunders interviewees have used Ecstasy in a religious
context, for meditation and prayer. One of these, a 70-year-old Zen monk
was unable to comprehend any other use for it until Saunders took him to
a rave.
''He went out of curiosity because he couldn't imagine how people were
taking this drug, which he had regarded as a way of being able to
meditate,'' says Saunders. ''After a while of observing people dancing
and moving around with them, he said: 'This is meditation, if these
people know it or not, they are meditating.'
''They were entirely involved in their movements, the music and in
what was going on around them, but weren't distracted by any internal
dialogue or thought processes, saying: 'I wonder what I look like? I
wonder if someone is looking at me? I wonder if I am doing the right
steps?' as they might in a disco.''
Saunders does point out that it is not the Ecstasy itself which causes
users to open up to each other or to achieve a ''walking meditation''
but that it acts as a catalyst. He is also aware that the effects can go
two ways.
''There's the positive way, of people learning through experience,''
he says. ''They can see things in perspective, and that the Ecstasy
experience isn't life itself, but is something to learn from.
''Then there are people who just long for the experience that they can
have on Ecstasy and live for the next weekend, which is quite damaging
because they tend to overdo it, get physically ill and not get on with
life.''
This boundless enthusiasm for weekend life was characterised in Come
On! by Franc, played by Tam Dean Burn. Charged with purchasing a large
amount of Ecstasy to help finance his wife's ailing club, he makes the
score but is so enamoured of the loved-up feeling given by the drug that
he gives it all away free, flooding the market.
The play succeeded because Damage used Club M8 as its stage. This
allows the company to create the atmosphere of a club, the lights and
the live mix of the sound track without actually having to represent the
dance-floor itself.
Franc provides a balance to the darker forces which are at work in the
clubs. Illegality has created a prohibition like black market, a
situation ripe for exploitation and pyramid selling.
Both Damage and Saunders are moving the debate on Ecstasy forward, but
Damage has articulated one unacceptable face of Ecstasy use which
Saunders is only able to treat in theory.
* Ecstasy and the Dance Culture is written and published by Nicholas
Saunders at #9.95.

Carole Woddis writes that one of Britain's best loved musicals is to
be revived in Edinburgh
IT'S hard to believe there was ever a time when the British musical
was not synonymous with Andrew Lloyd Webber. But before Lloyd Webber
took form by the scruff of the neck and blew it into the technological
phantasmagoria it has become today, the name most conjured up by the
words ''British musical'' belonged to a young ex-Cambridge undergraduate
called Julian Slade.
Next week, history catches up with itself when Julian Slade and
Dorothy Reynolds's Salad Days comes to the Edinburgh's King's Theatre
for a week as part of a 40th anniversary tour. The new production will
be directed by writer/director Ned Sherrin and star Kit and the Widow
and newcomers Nicola Fulljames and Simon Connolly as the young lovers.
Forty years ago, Slade's insouciant, beguiling musical about a magic
piano that makes people want to dance and two undergraduates who fall in
love in a heatwave and promise to ''never look back'', became the
unexpected hit of London's West End. With a cast that then included Eric
Porter, John Warner, and a young Norman Rossington, it went on to become
one of the longest running musicals in British theatrical history
(almost 3000 performances), before Lionel Bart's Oliver! and then the
arrival of the Lloyd Webber/Tim Rice Joseph and His Technicolour
Dreamcoat blew all previous records away.
As a child in Nyasaland (now Malawi) and part of the ex-pat community,
Kit (Hesketh-Harvey) remembers Slade along with Flanders and Swan
comprising the staple diet of his growing-up entertainment. ''I knew the
entire score by the age of two,'' he claims with outrageous precocity.
''It was like the Cats of its day: this constant stream of lollipops.''
What was it that made it so popular? It certainly can't have been the
story which Slade concedes was ''thin'', if ''staunch enough to wheel
the songs along''. Nor, he insists, was it pastiche like the other great
hit of the time, Sandy Wilson's The Boyfriend.
''People did speak differently in those days. We started with the idea
of two young people rebelling from their parents. Really they were the
first drop-outs.''
Perhaps then the musical appeals to a certain nostalgia for more
innocent times that possibly never were but the British like to think
once existed. Perhaps too it was the undemanding simplicity and charm of
songs like I Sit In The Sun, Look At Me I'm Dancing, and the ultimate
breezy We're Looking For A Piano that made it such a magnet for
audiences young and old alike.
Whatever, it certainly caught the public imagination. ''There's nobody
writes a tune like Julian Slade,'' says Sherrin who believes the time is
ripe for the Slade enchantment to once again work its magic. ''Children
will have a good time, and parents, for once, won't have to worry about
the language.''
By a strange coincidence, Salad Days has its own links with what came
after. As an open-eyed seven-year-old, the producer destined to play a
major role in the early days of the Lloyd Webber phenomenon, Cameron
Mackintosh, was taken to see Salad Days during its London run at the
Vaudeville theatre.
Afterwards, he went backstage and was introduced to Slade who
uncovered some of the secrets about the magic piano to him. From there
on, Mackintosh was hooked. ''I was like a kid with a Meccano set,'' he
recalls, ''I thought, 'this is what I want to do'.''
And so he did, becoming the richest, and possibly most powerful,
musical impresario in the West End.
Although Salad Days is undoubtedly a period piece, Slade, a spry
septuagenarian is naturally delighted at this revival -- the first since
1976 -- which also happens to coincide with the release of a new,
anniversary CD recording starring Roy Hudd, Leslie Phillips, Prunella
Scales and husband Timothy West, and Willie Rushton. Not bad for a show
that started out at the Bristol Old Vic in June of 1954 for a mere
three-week summer run.
* Salad Days is at the King's Edinburgh from September 11 for one
week.

AS the festivities ended in Edinburgh, Chichester is enjoying a golden
harvest in its two festival theatres, basking in the glow of some
vintage performers returning to the stage after a number of years away.
As the theatre approaches the end of its season (its final bonne bouche,
Lauren Bacall in Friedrich Durrenmatt's The Visit, opens in a couple of
weeks time), both the main and studio theatres are providing proof that
like good wine, some actors go on maturing with age.
Ian Richardson, superb as the villainous Urquhart in Michael Dobbs's
political satires, House of Cards and To Play the King, is now showing
in Nicholas Broadhurst's boisterous revival of Moliere's The Miser. His
performance shows what the English stage has been missing for the past
15 years and why in the sixties and early seventies Richardson was
regarded as one of the RSC's finest.
For a demonstration of controlled outrage and precision comic timing
they don't come better than Richardson's current performance as the
''tyrannical old skinflint'' Harpagon.
Double takes, sudden body swerves, and a shattering air of crisp
detachment are, and have been, the Richardson style, and Broadhurst in
Ranjit Bolt's spirited, irreverent translation plays those skills to the
hilt. Dressed in worn tweeds, Richardson's Harpagon is the picture of
middle-class prudence gone mad -- paranoid, obsessive, drooling over his
money like a lover his beloved.
It's a cruelly accurate, unflattering satire, a comedy of
heartlessness that, as in Broadhurst's highly successful updated Mozart
productions for his own company, Music Theatre London, finds
contemporary parallels with humorous directness.
A cupboard-bound, Lycra-clad, bike freak pedalling for all he is worth
powers the Harpagon electrical system while Harpagon himself recycles
his hot-water bottle for his early-morning cup of coffee -- waste not
want not carried to ridiculous lengths.
Lesley Joseph (Dorien in the top-rating TV sit-com Birds of a Feather)
joins Richardson in the comedy stakes as a more than usually virulent,
very funny Frosine, the divorcee turned marriage broker.
At the other end of the scale, in Sheridan's School for Scandal, Ian
Carmichael in companion with Honor Blackman, Dinsdale Landen and Dora
Bryan, exude bonhomie and geniality in the classic comedy of scandal and
hypocrisy. Sir Peter Teazle is really a bit of a tyrant, but there's
little sign of that in Carmichael's portrayal. Still, he brings such
warm control and assurance to his role, you forgive him almost
everything.
Richard Cotterell's production on the whole, however, is a
disappointment. Handsomely and ingeniously designed by Tim Goodchild, it
mistakes camperie and mugging for style and fails to release either the
play's real venom or comedy though Richard Garnett and Tim Wallers as
the young brothers, Joseph and Charles Surface keep up an energetic
front.
But for real satisfaction, you can't beat the late flowering of The
Hothouse. Harold Pinter's 1958 psychological-thriller is still from the
top drawer by any standard. Certainly it's wayward, indulgently
over-written but in its evocation of an institution falling apart, of
nameless prisoners held within, and of a British establishment rampant
with moral abuse, it manages with subtle inference and music hall brio
to touch those parts other writers never reach.
''I wouldn't have come if I'd known it was like this,'' the woman next
to me confided, describing it as ''spooky''. As in so much Pinter, it
is, enigmatically, menacingly, about territory, sex, and political
responsibility.
Pinter himself as the superintendent is in splendidly blimpish form, a
bellowing old bull of a colonel, splenetic, juicy, irascible. He's
accompanied by a four-star cast -- Celia Imrie as the grovelling,
rapacious female, John Shrapnel, as an opaque apparatchik, Tony Haygarth
the bloody-minded and subversive minder, and Christien Holt as the
sacrificial lamb. Like The Miser, it is transferring to the West End.
* The Miser runs at Chichester to September 16, School for Scandal to
September 14, and The Hothouse to Saturday only.

Opera
DO opera companies really need new productions of Don Giovanni every
few years? When the company is Scottish Opera, and when most of the
productions have missed the mark, the answer is doubtless yes. The
latest, which opened the 1995-96 season last night, is certainly not the
worst, but neither is it the best -- that accolade still goes to the
very first, set against the sliding panels of Ralph Koltai's memorable
abstract decor.
On this occasion, too, the decor commands the stage. Peter Howson's
lop-sided buildings, hard-edged skyscapes, eccentric doorways, and
twisted trees are indeed a major reason for seeing this Giovanni, though
they are sometimes too obtrusive. Moreover, when one piece of scenery is
hoisted up and replaced by another, the action is at times seriously
interrupted. In spite of Nicholas McGegan's fleet, light conducting,
this does seem a disappointingly slow-paced evening.
The trouble, largely, lies in the underpowered singing of what looks
on paper an interesting cast, and in the under-characterisation of many
of the roles. When Don Ottavio emerges as the strongest presence,
something is surely wrong -- though Neill Archer's, it must be said, is
a poetic and not at all wimpish portrayal. But much else does seem
rather small-scale, apart from the finely projected horn tone, full of
revealing detail.
Though John Cox's production tends to emphasise choreography at the
expense of character, it contains some nice touches and the finale to
Act One -- in which Giovanni seems already halfway to hell -- is
brilliantly devised. The supper scene, on the other hand, is feeble,
with Peter Mattei in the title-role standing around at the climax with
nothing much to do. Like most of the other singers, he is at his best in
quiet music -- the serenade is genuinely soft and honeyed -- but
otherwise too often fails to rise to the occasion.
Even Joan Rodger's Donna Elvira in this respect is curiously
low-keyed, and Yanni Yannissis's Leporello is drab. Francesca Pedaci's
Donna Anna, though sweetly voiced, lacks authority and Lisa Milne and
Neal Davies as yet make little of Zerlina and Masetto. A subdued
evening, then, but perhaps it will yet gain some of the passion it
needs.

HOT on the dusty heels of the Traverse's stunning Fringe production of
Sue Glover's play comes this NTC touring theatre company production
which trips through the lives of the Borders female farm labourers with
great energy but an occasionally leaden step.
Unsurprisingly, this Northumberland-based company, previously known as
Northumberland Theatre Company before the support of a five-year revenue
franchise from Northern Arts, bring a wealth of authentic detail, from
the sacking cloth wrapped around the women's legs and hands to the milk
cans, milk churn, and working hand pump.
The set is impressively designed by Cath Young, with the action sited
around a curious wooden cross-like structure which is variously a
cottage interior, a stable loft, and the barn for the dances which
brighten their hard lives.
Director Gillian Hambleton makes good use of the relatively small
space here but the production would have benefited from less movement
and more calm. She pitches the action at an unnecessarily melodramatic
level, with a constant rushing around and shrieking which undermines the
truly cathartic moments.
For all these dramatic bursts the production lacks an emotional
intensity, with the performances veering too wildly between limpid and
over-wrought -- in particular Jo-Anne Hovan's Tottie whose
unintelligible gibberish characterises her as not so much merely simple
as a deranged lunatic.
However, they do sustain the strength of the story, and the warmth of
the performances and the engaging and very spirited musical sequences,
directed by Katherine Zeserson, create a work which is absorbing enough.
* NTC's Bondagers is at the Adam Smith Theatre, Kirkcaldy, on October
13 and 14 and tours the Borders at the end of the month.

Margaret Vaughan investigates why it is that Scotland has one of the
highest instances in the world of the deadly E-coli bacterium, and what
can be done to stop the infection claiming more young victims
IT was the first, warm weekend in June that Fraser Imrie, a lively,
impish, toddler fell ill. There seemed little reason to worry unduly.
Tummy bugs and three-year-olds go together. Then the diarrhoea turned
bloody. On the Monday, June 5, he was taken to hospital. He deteriorated
rapidly. His kidneys failed, his heart wasn't pumping, there were signs
of neurological damage. There followed an intense 12-week battle to save
his life.
Fraser is at home now in North Berwick with his family, but he can't
walk, can't talk, can't eat. He may need a kidney transplant. His
mother, Fiona, nurses him round the clock, sleeps with him to ensure he
doesn't choke in the night. And, still, no-one can tell her how Fraser
came to be a victim of the E-coli 0157 organism, or even give her some
clue to the source of the toxins that devastated her son.
Scotland's Chief Medical Officer warned this week that the deadly
strain of food poisoning was showing a worrying increase in Scotland.
Last year there were 242 reported cases of E-coli poisoning.
Scotland now has the second highest recorded number of cases of any
country in the world, just behind Canada. The figures have risen
inexorably since 1984, when there were just three cases recorded in
Scotland.
Behind every bald statistic lies a story. Behind every case history is
the human toll on people like Fraser, and 18-month-old Claire Davison,
who died, and six other children whose kidneys were so damaged they
needed dialysis, after an outbreak in West Lothian. That infamous
incident, which struck down 69 people, was traced to contaminated milk
from a local dairy. It went into the records as the largest milk-borne
E-coli outbreak recorded in the world.
And behind the bald figures lie the questions:
* WHY does Scotland have a higher incidence of the deadly organism
than any other country in the world, apart from Canada?
* WHY is it six times commoner in Scotland than in England?
* WHY does the East of Scotland have a much higher number of cases
than the West?
* WHY is it 10 times commoner in Grampian than anywhere else in the
UK?
And for Fiona, at least, perhaps the most crucial question of all:
* WHY has it taken the agriculture bods and the farming lobby and the
Ministry of Agriculture and Food so long to admit what scientists have
suspected for so long? That Scotland's cattle herds may be the source of
the rise in the number of dangerous cases of E-coli poisoning?
The Chief Medical Officer, Dr Robert Kendall, alluded to the problem
in his annual report. He blamed intensive rearing methods for permitting
the easy spread of infection, along with carelessness in food storing
and preparation. It has only recently been possible, he said, to link
such outbreaks conclusively with cattle.
Until recently, according to agricultural scientists, there was a
great reluctance even to admit there was a problem and that it was
lurking in the food chain. It did not affect the health of animals. The
bacterium is found in the guts of cattle who show no outward signs of
illness. Ergo there was no visible problem.
It took an outbreak which struck 600 people in California to force an
acknowledgment at last that there was indeed a conclusive link. Those
who became ill had eaten hamburgers from a chain of restaurants.
Scientists traced the contamination back to a cattle herd.
Now, at the Scottish Agricultural College at Thurso, further research
into the problem and the veterinary links is underway.
Professor Hugh Pennington is the microbiologist who heads the Aberdeen
lab where all samples from patients struck down by E-coli in Scotland
are sent. He knows that the link with cattle is controversial, but says
none the less: ''The fact is that perhaps there is more of the bacterium
in the cattle up here. That may be where a lot of the organism is coming
from.
'' One is treading on sensitivities a bit, I know. For the farmer, it
doesn't cause problems in the cows, and it's got nothing to do with
hygiene or bad farming. It is part of the cow's normal bacterial flow in
its gut. The farmer will only know when it causes disease in a poor
affected patient. That, anyway, is the working hypothesis.''
Research is focusing on how the organism gets around. Professor
Pennington emphasises that this type of poisoning is not like a common
tummy upset: ''Here it is striking down normal, fit, healthy kids,
leaving quite a proportion with renal failure or bad kidneys and killing
some of them as well. It's a different scale of problem from the normal
kind of standard food poisoning where everybody gets better.''
Professor Pennington said that E-coli has only been known about for
around 15 years.
It was first discovered in Canada. According to a recent article in
the Journal of Medical Microbiology, written by a Scottish team of
researchers, there was little evidence of E-coli 0157 infection in the
UK before the mid-eighties.
The previous highest rate of infection before last year was in 1991,
when Scotland had 202 recorded cases. Only Canada, they said,
particularly the province of Alberta, had reported higher rates.
Some cases had been associated with travel abroad -- to Spain, Turkey,
Germany, Italy, the Gambia, France and Majorca. Most infections occurred
during the summer and early autumn.
There had been investigations of outbreaks in North America in which
the bacterium was identified in healthy cattle and in milk. It had also
been isolated from cattle faeces in abattoir surveys in Sheffield and
from healthy cattle in Germany.
Says Professor Pennington: ''We have good evidence that walking on to
a farm is a risk factor. Children playing in the farmyard have got the
infection. It is difficult, scientifically, to make the link because the
organism is not all that easy find. We are pretty confident that some of
the cases arise like that.''
It is, he says, children who are most at risk: ''Ordinary healthy
adults don't have these serious outbreaks. It is possible to limit the
risks.
''Food processing can be improved, more care taken when handling meat
at abattoirs, in cooking, in the kitchen, cooking hamburgers, for
example, until they are black. All that kind of thing reduces the risks
through the food chain.''
In North Berwick, meanwhile, Fiona Imrie counts the human cost to her
son. She suspects that the answers to the source of her son's illness
may lie not in the food that he ate but perhaps in the rich East Lothian
farmlands and pastures that seemed, once, an idyllic landscape for a
thriving toddler: ''I want some answers. I'll keep pushing until I get
them. What about cattle slurry? Contamination from tractors on the roads
and lanes? These are all questions that need answers.
''There is a lot, yet, that we don't know. But I do know one thing,''
says Mrs Imrie, a dentist who's had to give up work to care for her sick
son. ''Fraser's little brother, Lachlan, is only six months old just
now, but when he starts to run about he won't be going anywhere near
farms or farmyards or animals. Not until someone can reassure me
otherwise.''

Anne Simpson talks to Julia Carling about her life, her husband, and
the Princess of Wales
SOMEWHERE in the footnotes of history Julia Carling will reside as the
woman who desanctified Diana and, however fleetingly, made a future king
a happy man. In her perfectly judged dismissal of the princess with the
coy but roving eyes, Julia Carling has indirectly strengthened claims by
Charles's allies that he had the royal misfortune to marry a child who
turned into a destructively scheming neurotic.
What we are witnessing now, however, is a silky catfight between two
blonde sophisticates. And languishing in the middle there is a husband
possessed of such vain stupidity he trashes his own ego. It is a tale
which old Hollywood might have called The Fall of the Dumb Ox, starring
a doomed Jean Harlow, triumpant Claudette Colbert and Victor -- victim
of his pectorals -- Mature.
The story so far is this: Will Carling, captain of England's rugby
gladiators, no sooner expresses remorse to his wife for succumbing to a
silly flirtation with the Princess of Wales than he breaks his word that
the friendship is over by dropping off a couple of gifts for the young
princes at Kensington Palace.
And from an ante-room in that wretched household someone slips out to
tell the tabloids. By now Will not only looks like a bounder, he also
appears to be both a dumped and stitched-up plaything, for Diana, who
allegedly instigated the visit, is elsewhere when he calls. In fact, she
is comforting the stricken husband of her acupuncturist at Chelsea's
Royal Brompton Hospital, and doesn't return to the palace until Carling
has long gone.
Well, it might all be innocent, the last episode in fulfilling a
promise made some time ago to the Windsor boys. But somehow it has the
brimstone whiff of revenge directed not so much at Carling -- he is now
a mere humiliated incidental in the row -- but against the gamine Julia
whose public reprimand to Diana was all the more effective because of
its well-modulated politesse.
Julia Carling, in fact, is the only class act to emerge so far in this
unending saga of Splitsville. Her dazzling, confident demeanour is, of
course, the stuff of her former trade in public relations; a quality,
too, which has just landed her a #80,000 contract as a presenter with
Carlton Televison.
Equally, her years of working with poised but emotionally wounded
stars like Tina Turner has taught her how to wrap a photo opportunity
around a heartache. Certainly her response to disclosures of the sly,
thrice-weekly meetings between her husband and the princess was
impeccable.
She gauged correctly that any visible melancholy on her part, although
eliciting sympathy, would mark her down ultimately as a loser. Look how
quickly the media mauled a wan-faced Liz Hurley after Hugh Grant's tacky
night of betrayal.
No, Julia would assume the Perfect Prefect role she had earned at
Oakham School in Rutland in her native Northamptonshire. There she was
raised, the only daughter in a family of three, learning to say her
prayers at night and observe the niceties of the bourgeois well-to-do.
''This has happened to Diana before,'' she said, a reference to the
princess's past use of married men as confidants. Striking just the
right note of regret and censure, Julia Carling added: ''You hope she
won't do these things again, but she obviously does. However, she picked
the wrong couple to do it to this time. She really did.''
So, for a second occasion since their marriage a year ago, Julia had
skilfully deflected attention from her husband's crassness by focusing
it on herself. When Carling lost the England captaincy for referring to
members of the Rugby Football Union as ''57 old farts'' it was she who
charmed the old farts into restoring the title, wistfully lamenting that
it would be sad if Will's dreams should be shattered for the sake of one
careless slip of the tongue.
Now, aged 30, and one year older than Carling, her only mistake in a
sure-footed existence may curiously turn out to be that formidably
stoical aplomb which somehow reduces Carling the Hunk to Carling the
Creep. It could also be argued that she erred in marrying a man so less
clever than she. Will Carling's intellectual muscle would scarcely fill
a jockstrap, but love makes everyone slightly potty and within one month
of dating, Julia had accepted Will Carling's proposal of marriage.
''We had a very traditional church wedding that meant a lot because
this was the way I had been brought up,'' she says now. ''In fact, when
we came back from honeymoon that was the first time Will and I had lived
together. I felt very strongly about that.''
Yet in her early twenties, Julia Carling did break out of middle-class
decorum to chuck her place at Goldsmiths' College in London and live for
six years in America with a rock musician called Jeff Beck. But she was
always strict about sexual fidelity and the relationship is said to have
ended when she discovered Beck was having an affair with a Page Three
model.
Today she says of her marriage: ''Will and I are determined to sort
things out but we still have a long way to go. I don't have any
malicious feelings inside me and, contrary to what people may think, I'm
not a hard, aggressive type. But I feel: 'Sod this, I have a life too,
and it's not going to help if I go around looking bereft and
terrible'.''
It worries her, she insists, that the media portrays her as some sort
of no-nonsense icon. ''I'm not at all comfortable with that and the fact
is, as many women know, this is a hell of a thing to endure. Much of the
time I want to go home, watch Coronation Street, and weep. And I still
say my prayers at night, asking God to help us pull through together.''
Julia Carling's final school report noted: A sharp mind, enjoys
debate, offers the novel rather than the predictable answer. One former
pupil remembers her as ''very quiet''; another as ''the most
self-promoting person I ever met''. Not unaware of such comment, she
ruefully confides that she is now regrettably wary of ''friends''.
But people trained in PR worry so much about keeping a broad smile on
the face of truth that one suspects this sometimes leads them into that
cosmetic artifice where truth gets lost in fiction.
Julia Carling admits as much when, surveying the past few weeks, she
says: ''The thing I find most difficult is not being able to express my
deepest feelings because the whole business has become public
property.''
There is no doubt, however, that she has done the House of Windsor a
considerable favour. Up to this Diana's popularity still outstripped
that of Charles, perhaps the most troublesome aspect of their
separation. Now Diana herself has stymied the chances of setting up an
alternative court by allowing herself to be portrayed as predatory,
meddling with other people's marriages, perhaps out of some warped and
wilful discontent.
Curiosity about her fate will remain fervent but already she is being
edged into a social limbo by the Establishment which would rather bow to
a dishevelled monarchy than to one of its own damaged escapees. And on
that day when Diana's royal aura is finally extinguished no-one will
rejoice more than those watchful wives of all her over-flattered fools.

Mladic Grbin argues that the goal of eventual membership of the
European Union could be the best way to restore peace to the former
Yugoslavia and ensure future stability in the Balkans
THE conflict in former Yugoslavia and, more specifically, the tragedy
of Bosnia Herzegovina have become a metaphor for the individual and
collective weaknesses of the so-called international community.
The terms of reference within which European security and stability
were viewed and expressed through diverse national interests were
substantially undisturbed until the late eighties, with German
unification and the later collapse of the Soviet Empire.
This, combined with attempts to consolidate the European Community,
the growing economic recession in Europe, together with rising
unemployment and consequent social dislocation, brought European
countries to an important historical juncture where stock had to be
taken, with a clear understanding as to the direction in which European
countries wanted to go.
The problems of former Yugoslavia and the subsequent bloody conflict
were very much related to the scramble for new positions in the apparent
global political disorder, so much so that Bosnia Herzegovina became
much less to do with Bosnia Herzegovina itself and more to do with our
international response to it.
The problem was all the more difficult because Yugoslavia was an
artificial construct created in the wake of the First World War.
The Treaty of Versailles lumped together the Slovenes, Serbs, and
Croats into a state which geographically became identified with
Yugoslavia. This was the first of three Yugoslavias, starting with the
Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. In 1929, through the
abolition of the parliament by the Serbian King Alexander, the country
became an absolute monarchy. This in turn collapsed in 1941 upon the
signing of the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Bulgaria, to be
resurrected in 1945 by Josip Broz Tito and the Allies.
The third Yugoslavia was built largely on the role of the significant
anti-fascist resistance to German and Italian occupiers, the pro-fascist
governments of the virulent regime of the Independent State of Croatia,
the Serbian government of Nedic, Serbian royalists and others. The
anti-fascist movement was most evident in Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia
Herzegovina, and particularly the Croatian coastal area of Dalmatia
which suffered under Italian occupation.
In other words, Yugoslavia was built on victory over the common enemy,
and an ability to galvanise different nationalities for the common goal.
This Yugoslavia was administered under the slogan of ''Brotherhood and
Unity'' and in no small measure with the strong hand of coercion of the
state apparatus.
The apparent unity was promoted by the communist regime through a
great deal of experimental internal structuring, such as workers'
self-management -- a form of industrial democracy, decentralisation, and
the non-aligned movement externally. However, in 1974, in full awareness
of the fragility of the Yugoslav state, and the potential fracture
between constituent peoples, Tito pushed for a new constitution in an
attempt to lessen the undue influence of any one constituent republic,
with the all-important caveat of the right to secession.
Due to the importance of Yugoslavia for security and stability in
Europe, and the sphere of influence agreement between Churchill and
Stalin in 1944, Tito received an enormous amount of support from the
international financial institutions, thereby giving Yugoslavia the
appearance of relative prosperity.
The current American-led initiative and military intervention in
Bosnia Herzegovina by the Nato/UN alliance points to the necessity to
address the unfinished business of Yugoslavia. The Russian Federation,
on the other hand, is gradually asserting itself again through the
latest move of strong disapproval of Nato intervention together with a
bid to support the lifting of economic sanctions on Serbia. These
developments clearly point to an incipient cold war of another kind.
The posturing of either side in the tragedy of the peoples in former
Yugoslavia is unlikely to add to the peaceful solution but, on the
contrary, may exacerbate the extreme adversarial positions within the
former country itself.
An unavoidable way forward is in full recognition of the new terms of
reference which need to exist for the purpose of establishing a new
security arrangement in the area, with the full cognisance of the
legitimate requirements of its constituent people and, at the same time,
full adherence to, and re-establishment of, law and order.
While it is accepted that the devil is in the detail when it comes to
bringing an end to the conflict, there is a need for clear
identification as to the framework in which the solution is to be
sought.
For that, there must be a clear understanding between America and
Russia as to the areas of common interest and dispute, without
necessarily resorting to point scoring to gather benefits elsewhere,
since Europe desperately needs peace.
Whether Russia and America can deliver this peace is something that
the European states have to address seriously, and this is where the
common voice of Europe has been largely absent, partly through the fear
of some states that a real consensus on the Balkan crisis may be a first
step to achieving a European common foreign policy mechanism within the
EU.
While Nato military intervention is an essential part in breaking the
deadlock of the past four years of war, and while the major powers can
establish the broad incentives, the problem firmly remains in the lap of
Europe.
It is for this reason that it must be concluded that the best
framework within which European security and stability can be
established is by giving an opportunity to the successor states of
former Yugoslavia to work towards a graduated and negotiated entry into
the European Union.
As we have learned from the blunders and various attempts within and
outside the territory, the will and capacity to reach such an
accommodation has not been sufficiently in evidence in the activities of
some of the peoples of former Yugoslavia themselves, of Europe, or of
the rest of the international community.
The forthcoming meeting at Foreign Minister level in Geneva will
assess the short-term successes of the recent American initiative.
However, the problem will substantially remain a European one.
Europe can no longer afford the instability created by practices
reminiscent of those of the Second World War, as it is substantially for
this reason that European Union was created.

Ruth Wishart reports how Scotland's film industry is on a roll, but
will need a break to compete with the Irish
WHEN Celia Stevenson took over as director of Scottish Screen
Locations in the spring she inherited a small staff, an office which
probably contravenes the health and safety regulations for its inmates,
and a burgeoning interest in making movies in Scotland.
The premiere of Rob Roy, shot entirely on location in Scotland, was
about to turn Princess Street Gardens into a temporary Tinsel Town, and
Braveheart was set to underscore the scenic advantages of locating in
Scotland despite defecting to Ireland midway through the shoot. Put
together with a clutch of indigenous film successes like Shallow Grave,
the oscar-winning Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life, and this year's
much-lauded releases, The Near Room and Small Faces, the Scottish film
industry, in her words, ''was really on a roll''.
So when Sir Trevor Nunn came knocking on her door in the early summer
to investigate the possibility of spreading several more million
poundsaround the Scottish economy making a prestigious version of
Twelfth Night, she viewed this as another potential inward investment
coup.
''We knew what it had meant in the Lochaber area during those 16 weeks
when Rob Roy and Braveheart were both filming. During that time there
wasn't a single applicant for the local training-for-work scheme, the
garages were working round the clock, the pubs and cafes were open
longer, local tradesmen were involved with the companies and there was
just a tremendous feelgood factor. The whole area got a real buzz and a
grand conceit of itself.
''That made us determined that all these successes, both the locally
generated and the international, would be a springboard for a real and
permanent boost to the film industry. Hollywood loves a bandwagon and we
had one rolling.''
She concedes that the Trevor Nunn film isn't in the Braveheart class,
but would have represented many millions of pounds for the local economy
wherever it's made. Says Stevenson: ''We found him what he thought were
the perfect locations, we found him hotel accommodation for the crew at
the right price, and the fact that he would be in Strathclyde meant he
had access to some funds from the Glasgow Film Fund.
''He was really enthusiastic and committed. But then the company took
a look at Ireland,  and Ireland could offer what we could with jam on
top. They have offered him tremendous tax breaks under their Section 35
tax clause. And if they film there now it will be because in any
business the bottom line is what counts in the end.''
Stevenson was at the private dinner party at Edinburgh Castle last
Saturday thrown by Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth for Mel Gibson and
his company executives. And she confirms that in Gibson's case the tax
breaks weren't necessarily the only factor which found William Wallace
re-enacting the Battle of Stirling Bridge on the outskirts of Dublin.
''He certainly told us that a major part of the attraction of going to
Ireland was being able to get access to 1500 soldiers who certainly
weren't on Equity rates, and being able to stage the battle scene near
Ardmore studios which gave him on-site editing facilities.
''And there's no doubt that the one-stop shop facility he was telling
us about is missing from our portfolio at the moment. BBC and Scottish
Television  can't cope with that kind of demand so we need a dedicated
sound stage in Scotland, and our own film labs would be a major bonus
allowing post production here as well.
''Nevertheless, you can't underestimate the attraction of a tax system
positively geared to the film industry. When Michael D Higgins took over
as Arts Minister, Ardmore studios had closed due to lack of interest.
Last year, in contrast, Ireland made 18 films and crews were in such
demand that you had to chain them up in case they got a better offer.
''The Irish aren't daft either. Every one of these films had to employ
a shadow Irish crew. Right up to director level. And there's no better
in-service training than cutting your teeth on a Hollywood
blockbuster.''
She thinks that the Scottish Office has begun to get religion about
the potential of film for Scotland, and has already been promised a
six-figure package authorised by the Scottish Secretary allowing
Scottish Screen Locations to create a CD-Rom and sell its wares on the
Internet.
''Obviously what we will show will just be a taster. We'll be able to
demonstrate to potential clients just how various locations were used in
previous films. We'll be able to demonstrate too that Scotland doesn't
just offer hills, glens, castles, and Hielan' hames. We've got a whole
raft of urban locations too.''
At the moment SSL deals with a steady series of slightly
less-glamorous demands, finding the right backdrops for anything from
Japanese car commercials to magazine fashion shoots. It also has to deal
diplomatically with officials from the Disney Corp demanding the
location of a waterfall zone specified as being roughly twice the size
of Ben Nevis without yielding to the temptation to refer the caller to
the Guinness Book of Records.
But what SSL's director is chasing hardest are a few more biggies to
keep that bandwagon on the roll, and Twelfth Night would have confirmed
1995 as a vintage year. ''We went through an enthusiastic patch before
when Local Hero was made here. That turned out to be a temporary blip.
This time we want to build on some terrific achievements. But you can
have the best locations in the world, the best infrastructure and if
someone somewhere can match that and add tax breaks we're never going to
be on a level playing-field. It all comes down to money in the end.''

With five new local radio stations looming for Scotland, Anne
Johnstone wonders if the industry can sustain this rapid expansion
AT THE start of next year Scotland will acquire its twentieth
commercial radio station. Officially it doesn't have a name yet but it
will be based in Oban and will beam its programmes out across the Sound
of Mull and into lonely crofts dotted around Argyll. And there are more
to follow.
Some observers are beginning to wonder how long this spectacular
expansion can continue before some start coming to grief. How many radio
stations do we really need to serve 5.5 million people?
Scottish commercial radio has come a long way pretty fast since Radio
Clyde went on the air 22 years ago. Scottish Radio Holdings plc, of
which Clyde is a part, now owns no fewer than nine of the 19 stations
currently broadcasting north of the Border -- Clyde, Forth, NorthSound
and Radio Tay (each with two), plus Radio Borders -- and has its sights
set clearly on two more (West Sound and South West Sound).
Meanwhile, there has been a proliferation of small community-based
stations such as Shetland Islands Broadcasting Company, which came on
air in 1991, and Heartland FM, which has the smallest target audience of
any station in Britain. Its mix of local news, information, Scots music,
and Gaelic is pumped out to just 5000 folk around Pitlochry and
Aberfeldy. Scot FM, enfant terrible of the Scottish commercial scene,
burst on central Scotland a year ago and is now building a
respectably-sized audience after a bad start.
This growth has been matched elsewhere in the UK. Ten years ago there
were just 49 commercial stations. Today there are 178. The Radio
Authority grants a new licence every month on average. In the next 18
months that average is set to double. That is because FM frequencies
between 105 and 108 MHz, previously occupied by land-based uses such as
taxi-firms and police broadcasting, have been vacated.
So this month the Authority begins advertising new licences to fill
these frequencies. There are 33 areas on its shopping list, including
five in Scotland. Once the Oban licence is awarded, others will follow
in Dundee, Fife, Peterhead, and Stornoway. The detailed timetable will
be published at the end of this month. ''We've selected these areas
because we know there's an interest there,'' says Tracy Mullins of the
Radio Authority.
This could be the start of a much bigger expansion in the sector. The
Government is currently pondering how to introduce to the commercial
sector Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB), a new high-quality transmission
system which will enable radio listeners to enjoy CD quality sound and
solve the infuriating problem for drivers of having to retune to
different frequencies as they move from one area to another. To receive
it we will have to buy new radios and they aren't being mass-produced
yet so there is some doubt as to how quickly DAB is likely to take over
from FM and AM, even though the BBC is about to start using it.
The main benefit for the industry is that you can squeeze about twice
as many stations into the same band width. In theory, that means that by
the start of next century we could have more than 400 commercial
stations in Britain, including around 50 in Scotland. Do we want them?
Can the market sustain them?
In recent years the dramatic growth of commercial radio has been
sustained by an equally steep rise in advertising revenues. Until around
three years ago radio took only about 2% of the total advertising spend,
compared with 8% in France, and 10% in Ireland. The advent of the
national commercial stations (Classic FM, Virgin Radio, and Talk Radio
UK) brought with it national advertising.
In three years radio has more than doubled its share of the
advertising cake and the figure is still growing.
Small groups of businessmen and volunteers, who have grown out of the
community boradcasting movement, are encouraged to go for a permanent
licence by the newfound enthusiasm of local businesses and national
companies for using them as an advertising medium. The Rev Stanley
Bennie, an Episcopalian Minister in Stornoway, is the man behind Isles
FM, the group hoping to win a licence next year to broadcast to Lewis
and ultimately throughout the Western Isles.
They have tried their hand at the job twice using Restricted Service
Licences, temporary licences issued by the Radio Authority. ''I was
surprised at the support we had from advertisers,'' he said.
But according to John Gray, convener of the Scottish Association of
Small-Scale Broadcasters, his members are never likely to raise more
than 50% of their revenue from commercial advertising. The rest comes
from a variety of sources, including grants, organising public events,
and fundraising.
The big operators in the sector have rather ambivalent views about the
smaller players. ''The big boys want to maximise their profits and would
prefer not to have competition from the likes of us,'' says Bennie.
Richard Findlay, managing director of Radio Forth, who takes over as
chief executive of Scottish Radio Holdings next year, denies this: ''I
think we need some more small local stations. From a selfish point of
view, you could say they are a very good nursery for us to dip into.
They also bring new advertisers into the market. But beyond that one has
got to be careful to see what the market can stand in commercial terms.
The call for more stations isn't being driven by more listeners but by
potential operators. Do listeners really want them? Can the market
support them?''
In recent months there have been a number of takeovers in the UK
commercial radio sector. One prediction is that in 10 years' time the
industry will be dominated by a handful of large firms, especially if
ownership rules are changed to allow a company to own a local radio
station and a local television station in one area, or two FM stations
in one area. Also there must be doubts about whether radio advertising
revenues will continue to grow at their present rate. For ''giddy
expansion'', perhaps we should be reading ''dramatic rationalisation''.

AN Olympic swimming coach accused of rape persuaded a schoolgirl to go
on the Pill by saying it would improve her ability in the pool, Cardiff
Crown Court heard yesterday.
Mr Paul Hickson, 47, allegedly convinced the girl's mother that
Russian women athletes used the contraceptive pill to improve their
swimming.
But the woman, who is now 32, told the jury: ''It meant that way we
could have sex whenever he wanted it.''
Mr Hickson, Britain's coach at the Los Angeles and Seoul Olympics,
denies two charges of rape, 13 charges of indecent assault, and two
other serious sexual offences.
The woman claimed: ''He said that Russian swimmers were taking the
Pill, which had a good oestrogen level, and that would help my swimming.
''The doctor agreed to put me on the Pill, but he wasn't happy,
neither was my mother. I was 14 or 15 when this was happening.''
The prosecution claims Mr Hickson, of Street, Somerset, repeatedly
raped the girl, forced her to perform oral sex, and whipped her with a
riding crop.
The woman told the court the abuse started when she was 13, after
joining Mr Hickson's ''elite'' swimming squad near her Norwich home.
''The first time it happened I didn't know what was happening to me.''
She alleged: ''He pulled my trousers around my ankles and got on top
of me. I couldn't move.
''I just lay there like a dummy; what else could I do?''
The woman claimed Mr Hickson ordered her to perform oral sex on him
and that they took part in whipping sessions.
The prosecution claims he preyed on girls as young as 11 during his 15
years as a coach.
Mr Hickson, married with an eight-year-old daughter, was due to stand
trial in 1993 for alleged sex assaults on girl swimmers he coached in
Swansea.
The court heard he absconded and when police made a national appeal to
hunt him down, other young swimmers came forward to say they were abused
by him.
The woman who gave evidence yesterday said that instead of reporting
Mr Hickson when she was a teenager, she had a mental block about the
abuse she suffered.
''They would have taken my swimming away from me and that was really
important to me. I just felt pathetic, ashamed, embarrassed, and ugly.''
The trial continues.

UNION officials emerged from talks with management of Hydro-Electric
yesterday confident that the power company's pledge to reduce costs
would not lead to compulsory redundancies.
Both sides stressed that the Perth talks had been positive and that
industrial action over planned jobs cuts was unlikely.
Mr Alan Cowan, secretary of the joint trade union commitee said:
''Discussions were positive . . . I am confident that there will not be
any compulsory redundancies in Hydro-Electric.''
Mr Roger Young, Hydro-Electric's chief executive, admitted that
Government demands for an 8.5% reduction in electricity prices and the
high costs of maintaining rural power lines would result in job losses.
Hydro is seeking to cut running costs by 20%.
But Mr Young added: ''We have an excellent relationship with our trade
unions, we have never fallen out with them and I don't expect that we
will.''
Between 60 and 70 senior engineers, from a workforce of 1500 in the
company's power systems division, have already been told that they will
be offered voluntary redundancy.

A FLAT-owner is facing a new threat of eviction to make way for a
#400m development near Glasgow Airport.
Mr Tony Chalk, 49, has refused to move from his flat in Douglas
Terrace, Paisley, despite the fact that a sheriff granted Glasgow
Airport an eviction order two months ago.
Airport managers plan to demolish his house and build a business park
on the land.
Last month, the Court of Session ruled that sheriff officers were
wrong to board up the premises and change the locks, saying they had
acted prematurely.
However, in a legal move at Paisley Sheriff Court yesterday, lawyers
acting on behalf of Glasgow Airport were allowed to adjust the terms of
the original interlocutor.
Mr Chalk, a motor mechanic, said afterwards he was now expecting the
sheriff officers to call again.
He has been trying for almost three years to win ''realistic
compensation'' for his three-bedroom flat.
Glasgow Airport has offered him #24,000.
He said yesterday: ''I have lived here for 26 years. What kind of
alternative accommodation do they expect I can buy for #24,000?''
He is still hoping to mount a last-ditch legal bid to halt eviction
and plans to appeal to the Lands Tribunal to win a higher valuation.
Most of the residents who lived in the Douglas Terrace block accepted
the compensation sums.
Mr Chalk's brother, Robert, the pastor of Paisley's Mossvale Miracle
Church, is also in dispute over the #85,000 offered for his detached
eight-roomed villa nearby.
He maintains the property is worth #125,000 and is also refusing to
move until an improved bid is made.
A spokesman for Glasgow Airport said last night: ''We are taking legal
advice on what the next step should be.''

<HEADLINE>Minister accuses Greenpeace. Brent Spar campaign 'was a con'</HEADLINE>

ENERGY Minister Tim Eggar yesterday accused Greenpeace of trying to
con the public with its Brent Spar campaign and said its credibility had
been totally undermined.
He welcomed Greenpeace's apology for issuing incorrect information
during the campaign about the contents of the installation.
However, Mr Eggar told the Offshore Europe conference that it was not
a minor error as the environmental pressure group had suggested, but was
in fact part of a campaign of misinformation.
''We all know who they were trying to con,'' he said. ''The
politicians and public of the UK and Europe. They claimed this was an
isolated and minor mistake but there were a significant number of other
false claims.''
He said that Greenpeace had claimed Shell had concealed the low cost
of onshore disposal to get approval for a more expensive deep-water
option, which had been shown to be untrue; it claimed no inventory of
Brent Spar had been carried out when one had, ''down to the last light
bulb''; and that a marine scientist had said the wastes should not be
dumped at sea when in fact his comments were made in the context of an
onshore dismantling option.
''Greenpeace's credibility has been totally undermined. It is all the
worse that they only admitted their mistakes when they knew they would
be found out because there was going to be an independent inspection.
''In recent days and before this revelation some of the media have
admitted they were manipulated by Greenpeace over the Brent Spar
incident.
''I hope we can now put that behind us and have a serious and sensible
debate based not on emotion but on scientific evidence.''
He said the public had heard rather less of the many distinguished
scientists who agreed that deep-sea disposal was a sensible approach
from the environmental point of view.
''I think Greenpeace have done themselves a lot of harm. If they want
to be taken as a serious environmental organisation they have to be
prepared to debate and discuss scientific facts. If they change the
nature of their approach I suppose it is possible they can be treated
seriously.
''I think it was a feature throughout Greenpeace's campaign that they
made a series of wild allegations which they never really sought to
substantiate and which, when they were rebutted, mainly by Shell, they
chose to throw to one side and move on to the next wild allegation. I
don't think this was an isolated incident.''
Mr Eggar made it clear that deep-sea dumping was still very much an
option for Brent Spar.
''We have to look for the best practical environmental option. Thirty
studies over three years and costing more than #1m came to the
conclusion that the best option from an environmental point of view was
deep-sea disposal and it remains an option.''
He said he believed Shell had done enough within the UK to convince
people of the arguments for deep-sea disposal but that they had not
successfully put across their arguments in Europe.
Labour's front bench spokesman on energy, Mr Martin O'Neill, told the
conference that one of the problems about evaluating Shell's decision on
disposal of Brent Spar was that the public had been kept in the dark
over negotiations between Shell and the Government.
He said Labour was not happy with the way the abandonment process was
conducted and called for more transparency in negotiations between
Government departments and licensees.
''In the short term the Government has been extremely embarrassed by
the whole sequence of events and Britain's reputation as a whole to the
Green supporters of mainland Europe has sunk even lower than it already
was.''

NEARLY half of all women would cheat on their partners if they thought
they could get away with it -- and one in five already have, according
to a survey.
Only one in three women thought that men were naturally unfaithful.
In all, 44% of the 1000 women between 16 and 65 questioned by Woman's
Realm magazine said they would consider having an affair if they thought
they would not be found out.
More than one third of those surveyed admitted they had thought about
leaving their partner. However, 40% thought trust and fidelity were the
most important aspects of a relationship.
When couples argue, they are most likely to do so about money: 41%
said it was the main problem.

SHETLAND Islands Council said yesterday it would be prepared to reduce
its income from the Sullom Voe terminal to zero if it would safeguard
its future, writes Graeme Smith.
The council and the oil companies, Shell and Chevron, are currently
#15m apart on their calculations on the difference between the annual
cost of running the terminal and offshore loading for the Northern North
Sea fields, which the companies are investigating.
The current contracts are due to run out in 2000 and, if agreements
for the future cannot be reached with both companies, there could be
serious financial consequences for the islands.
Mr Malcolm Green, the council's chief executive, said that if the
companies opted for offshore loading the impact would be immediate, with
a loss of business confidence, and by the year 2000 there would be an
exodus of an estimated 1500 people.
''They would be people in whom the council has invested money in
education, for example; young people who will help generate a healthy
economy beyond 2000. The value of the terminal to the economy is far in
excess of any income the council derives from it.''
Discussions were continuing in an attempt to reach agreement on the
annual cost difference. The oil companies' estimate is #15m, but the
council believes it could be as low as #500,000.
Mr Green said the council had already offered to reduce its rental by
50% from #7.8m.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth will today spell out his vision on
how local government will develop amid fears of drastic upheavals as the
new councils take control next April.
He is due to address the Scottish conference of the Institute of
Revenues Rating and Valuation in Peebles in his new guise as a listening
Minister.
This is certain to contrast with the his last appearance at the IRRV
Scottish conference at Aviemore in 1990 when he was supporting the poll
tax.
IRRV President Richard Harbord warned that similar administrative
upheaval which followed the community charge lies ahead with the current
reorganisation.
''Local government in Scotland faces a massive and stressful period,''
he said.
''I am sorry if this is a grim forecast, but it is, I believe, a
realistic one. This period will test not only the technical and
operational skills of local government officers, but most importantly
their managerial skills and experience.''
Mr Harbord said he was confident that the staff would rise to the
challenge and maintain high quality services.

into effect a week ago, but was put off because of the cooler weather
and a drop in demand.

GLASGOW'S Argyle railway line, closed by heavy flooding after
torrential rain last December, will reopen on September 24. More than
#4m of damage was caused to the line when the worst floods for many
years surged through the tunnels after a retaining wall on the River
Kelvin near Kelvin Bridge gave way, causing millions of gallons of water
to breach into a disused tunnel.
It knocked out signalling equipment and marooned two trains at Glasgow
Central low level. The water, polluted with sewage and oil, was 12ft

THE first full-time immersion course in Gaelic, aiming to make
beginners fluent by next June, was launched yesterday by the Gaelic
development body Comunn nan Gaidhlig (CNAG).
It hopes to give students the skills needed to tackle the increasing
opportunities in Gaelic-related employment.
An immersion course for adult learners has long been seen by
campaigners for Gaelic as vital if a future for the language is to be
ensured.
The 15-place course, designed by CNAG in partnership with Inverness
College, is based at the college's Lochaber Centre in Fort William.
Mr Pat Connolly, head of the Lochaber Centre, said yesterday: ''Demand
for the places was phenomenal. We had inquiries from as far afield as
New Zealand.''
Mr Roy Pedersen, CNAG's development director, said: ''The course is
designed to be relevant to the unemployed, women returners, and others
interested in acquiring a working knowledge of the language. CNAG hopes
to use the Lochaber model to help establish more immersion courses
throughout Scotland.''

SHADOW Scottish Secretary George Robertson said yesterday he was
disturbed by the self-perpetuation of the boards of Scotland's 13 local
enterprise companies, which pick their own board members.
Mr Robertson's said there was a question of legitimacy as the Lecs had
huge influence in bringing investment and new projects to Scotland.
He also said the Labour Party had a task-force -- led by the Dumbarton
MP, Mr John McFall, and Monklands East MP, Mrs Helen Liddell -- to look
specifically at how Scottish Enterprise and the Lecs fitted into the
process of creating new jobs.
His comments were made during a fact-finding tour of Lecs in Edinburgh
and Glasgow. He has already visited ones in Tayside and Grampian.
Mr Robertson said: ''We must look at how much autonomy Lecs will have.
This self-perpetuation of the boards of Lecs, where they pick themselves
and don't even have to notify Scottish Enterprise, never mind the
Secretary of State for Scotland, is obviously something that disturbs
me.
''There is a question of legitimacy in as much as these Lecs have got
huge influence -- smallish budgets, but huge influence in levering
development projects.''
However not all his comments were critical, he added. ''Yesterday I
was taken round the Edinburgh conference centre, the new Festival
Theatre, new developments in the Holyrood and Royal Mile which are all
happening because Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd, the local
authorities, and the private sector have made something happen.
''These are good records and it is a key instrument, but getting the
balance of legitimacy against effectiveness is something that we are
looking at.''
He said there was likely to be more emphasis on Lecs in the near
future because functions such as training, land use, and strategic
planning were ''collapsing into their hands'' because of the
fragmentation of local government in Scotland.
''But these Lecs are not elected; not accountable to anyone apart from
very distantly to Michael Forsyth, and that is worrying a lot of them as
well as us,'' said Mr Robertson.
''What they are looking for are assurances for the future, and what I
am basically saying is that Scottish Enterprise and the linked network
will be key instruments of Labour's economic development planning when
we come to power and will be key instruments linked to the Scottish
parliament when it is set-up.''
Mr Robertson said he hoped a policy document on the economy and jobs,
taking in Lecs, would be put together by Mr McFall and Mrs Liddell in
time for next year's party conference in Edinburgh.

A HOSPITAL is accepting cast-off equipment from an oil company which
is improving medical services for its own workers.
Aberdeen Royal Infirmary is to use the equipment in its theatres and
surgical wards.
The items have been discarded by Elf Enterprise Caledonia, after it
refurbished the sick bay on one of its North Sea oil platforms.
The equipment, valued at between #5000 and #10,000, will be used for
patients at the infirmary, while oil workers benefit from improved
medical centre.
The NHS trust hospital has been given two beds, a theatre trolley, a
sterilisation unit, and a dressing trolley, which are now surplus to
requirements on the Claymore accommodation platform.
The oil company recently upgraded the platform, separating its
accommodation and producing sections.
With 250 personnel on board the rig, 100 miles north-east of Aberdeen,
it was decided to invest in a refurbished medical suite.
The second-hand goods have been transported the 100 miles to the
Aberdeen hospital, which treated many of the victims of the Piper Alpha
disaster.
An official of the hospital said yesterday they were grateful to the
oil company and its staff for their generosity.
''We can certainly make good use of the equipment. People give things
for a lot of different reasons, although most of it is usually as a
result of fund-raising,'' she added.

THE interests of electricity consumers are in danger of being
overlooked as the industry prepares for the arrival of all-out
competition between suppliers in 1998, it was claimed yesterday.
The warning came from Professor Tom Carbery, chairman of the Southern
Scotland Electricity Consumers' Committee, as he published its annual
report.
Last year, the competitive market for electricity supply was extended
to 100-kilowatt business customers across Britain. In 1998, the freedom
to choose suppliers will be extended to everyone, all businesses and all
domestic consumers.
However, the SSECC, which represents the interests of all customers in
the ScottishPower area, fears consumers' needs could be forgotten.
The committee is concerned that some suppliers could indulge in
''cherry-picking'': where one company moving into another's traditional
area selects only the better-off customers, ignoring those it believes
could be difficult.
One solution would be to require any supplier moving into another area
to offer electricity at the same price to all customers in the same
category in that area.
''It would mean that if another company came into the ScottishPower
area, for example, it would not be able to swoop on Bearsden and Newton
Mearns without being equally available for Easterhouse and Castlemilk.
But this sort of issue has not been discussed in anything like the
detail we would wish,'' Professor Carbery said.
Much of the preparation for 1998 was being devoted to inter-company
talks on questions such as how suppliers would pay one another for
services rendered and electricity theoretically transmitted from one
company to another.
Professor Carbery said: ''The process leading to the 1998 extension is
so complicated that there is a grave danger that the industry's chief
executives and Offer (the Office of Electricity Regulation) will
concentrate on the administrative arrangements between companies.
''This could mean that they do not give sufficient attention to the
effect the changes will have on the 20 million consumers throughout
Great Britain.''
Professor Carbery also disclosed that a majority of his committee had
been in favour of ScottishPower's takeover bid for the Chester-based
Manweb electricity company being referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
The committee's view was sought by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the
electricity industry regulator, who also argued for a referral. Last
week, Trade Secretary Ian Lang declined to refer the bid.
However, Professor Carbery said yesterday the committee did not
believe the takeover would cause any problems for ScottishPower
customers.
The annual report, which covers the year to March 1995, reveals that
the committee has been less involved with consumers' complaints than in
the past. These covered disconnections, estimated billing, prepayment
arrangements and disputed accounts.
Professor Carbery said this was in keeping with the fall in complaints
to ScottishPower and to Offer, and also reflected the ''much improved
consumer standards aimed for and attained'' by the company.
Last night, a ScottishPower spokesman said it welcomed the fact that
Professor Carbery had recognised the improved services it had been
providing in recent years.

A VOLUNTEER on a commu-
nity care support group hit out last night over the lack of funding
for such schemes, writes Rob Robertson.
Mr Jack Webster, 72, talked of the difficulties facing helpers who
tried to care for those who needed support. Mr Webster, chairman of the
Pentlands Dementia and Care in the Community committee in Edinburgh,
said people were concerned at the lack of cash available to support
groups.
''Groups such as ours provide a vital service and in some cases
provide a meal service and take people for an afternoon to allow people
caring for them time off,'' he said.
''I do not think there is enough money to pay for such services or the
care in the community programme. Many groups are only working with great
difficulty with some workers going cap in hand for funds. Transferring
NHS treatment to means-testing means that people who received treatment
in hospital will have to pay for services.
''Lothian Health are proposing to close 900 long-stay beds and we are
worried that it will mean a bigger financial shift of responsibility
from the state to the individual in such cases. It is clear things are
not running smoothly. Because of the lack of cash, volunteers are taking
on more and more responsibility.''
Mr John Crichton, 79, chairman of the Scottish Pensioners Forum, said:
''The National Health Service and Community Care Act has been on the
books for five years and still people have fears over it. Community care
is OK in theory but, if the resources are not given to fund it, the
system will not work.''

THE Tories' reform of Scotland's water and sewerage system would
produce significant overall savings, Industry Minister George Kynoch
insisted yesterday.
Opening an exhibition in Glasgow, he defended the Government's
controversial decision to introduce three new public authorities to run
Scotland's water and sewerage services and rejected a suggestion that it
amounted to ''back-door privatisation'' of the industry.
Mr Kynoch reaffirmed that 20% of the #5000m needed to upgrade water
and sewerage would have to be provided through Build, Own and Operate
(BOO) schemes operated by the private sector. This would be the best way
to ensure the public good value for money, he said.
Mr Kynoch told delegates to Scottish Water '95 -- the second such
exhibition featuring companies seeking to sell their products to the new
unitary authorities -- that 7000 Scots were employed in the sector,
which had an annual turnover of #500m.
He said a Customers' Council would safeguard consumers' interests,
monitoring performance, investigating complaints, and playing a
''special'' role in approving charges.
He admitted that costs were certain to increase, but said they would
also have risen under the old system. Over the last six years, he said,
they had gone up by an average of 76%.
He added: ''I would like to see the new authorities keeping charge
increases to a minimum through their greater efficiencies and economies
of scale, and their ability to attract innovative skills from the
private sector.''
The Scottish Office has identified 16 projects as being suitable for
BOO schemes. Mr Kynoch said he was keen to see the private sector
becoming involved in all aspects of capital spending,.
BOO schemes are part of the Private Finance Initiative, which the
Government hopes will become a ''cornerstone'' of future public
expenditure plans.
Under the schemes, private sector ''partners'' will build and operate
treatment works on the basis of a service contract with the local
authority and would retain ownership of the works.
The 16 schemes which have been identified as potential BOO schemes,
are: East of Scotland -- Levenmouth Sewage Treatment Works; Edinburgh
Sewage Treatment Works; Edinburgh Sludge Disposal Scheme; River Almond
Relief Sewer; New Powerburn Relief Sewer, and The Water of Leith Sewer
Replacement Phase One and Two.
West of Scotland -- Ayr Sewage Treatment Works and Outfall; sewage
treatment works at Dalmuir; Meadowhead; Stevenston, and Milngavie Water
Treatment Works.
In the North of Scotland -- sewage treatment works at Aberdeen,
Banff/Macduff, Panmuirfield and Stannergate, Dundee, and the Inverness/
Fort William sewage treatment scheme.

A HARD-hitting report yesterday spelled out widespread public concern
about the implementation of the Government's community care policy.
The 68-page Lothian Health Council report was based on responses from
more than 4000 people who attended more than 100 public meetings over
three months in Lothian, one of the biggest surveys ever undertaken in
Scotland.
The report concentrated on services for old people, mental health
services, and both primary and community health services. The public's
main concern was regarding the practical implications of implementing
the care strategy. The whole programme was seen by many as a thinly
veiled method to achieve savings.
One person interviewed said he was worried he might be left
''penniless, homeless, and helpless'' because of the care scheme. Other
fears included a belief that the Government was trying to shift
financial responsibility for care costs increasingly on to the consumer.
The public supported the broad principles of Lothian Health's Care for
the Future consultation but only in theory rather than in practice was
the strategy seen as a positive step.
Ms Phyllis Herriot, chairman of Lothian Health Council, said: ''It is
clear the public feel existing community care services are not meeting
their needs. Worries are being expressed about what the future holds for
people who require caring services and for those who perform the role of
carers.''
Mrs Herriot said the report included 11 pages of recommendations,
including calls for improvement to the quality of care service, more
finance for it, a better quality of service for old people, and a better
mental health strategy.
''These need to be addressed as a matter of urgency before people will
have any faith in the direction in which we are being driven,'' she
said.
Lothian Health said it would review the responses and amend its plans
accordingly.
Lothian Health Board's general manager, Mr Trevor Jones, said he was
encouraged by the general support for the strategies and welcomed the
opportunity to take on board people's concerns.
However, he added: ''It is disappointing Lothian Health Council sees
the strategies as a cost-saving measure when, in fact, we are proposing
to spend an extra #50m in primary and community care services.
''I understand that people will be anxious at such major changes. They
can, however, feel reassured that this board will carefully review the
responses it has received and will amend the plans accordingly.''
Mr Robert Stevenson, the secretary of the health council, welcomed Mr
Jones's comments about taking on board the responses. Mr Stevenson said
the relationship between the public and Lothian Health was at a
watershed and it had to be seen to be listening to feedback from the
public in surveys.

MORALE among members of Professions Allied to Medicine in the NHS has
slumped over the past two years, with only a minority able to provide
what they regard as a satisfactory service, a survey published today
indicates.
The vast majority claimed not to have enough resources to do their
jobs properly, found their work stressful and had considered leaving the
NHS in the past year.
The survey sample covered 10% of all NHS physiotherapists,
occupational therapists, chiropodists, dieticians, orthoptists,
radiographers and related staff who come under the PAMs umbrella, and
follows a similar survey two years ago.
Last year, there were 6649 such workers in the NHS in Scotland
(equivalent to 5471 whole-time staff). Their numbers have been
increasing steadily year by year, but Ms Jocelyn Prudence, staff-side
secretary for PAMs, said these increases were being outstripped by the
increase in demand from different quarters.
''The switch from acute care to Care in the Community has produced
more work for occupational and physiotherapists, health consciousness
engendered by initiatives like Health of the Nation has increased demand
for dietitians, and increasingly there has been a general awareness that
the kind of interventions PAMs provide can be really effective,'' she
said.
''There is a whole area of demand that is not officially being met but
is being covered by unpaid overtime. There is also a lot more paperwork,
which often can't be done during the working day and has to be taken
home at night.''
The survey will form part of the PAMs evidence to their Pay Review
Body for 1996.
Ms Prudence said: ''The findings are an important indication of the
increasing pressures being put on PAM staff. It is not suprising that
escalating workloads, inadequate resources, and poorer staffing levels
are leading to more stress ans lower morale.
''The PAMs are a dedicated workforce committed to providing
high-quality patient care, though this is clearly becoming more
difficult in the NHS. While they get satisfaction from the nature of
their work, they also need to be fairly and properly rewarded.''
The key findings (1993 survey findings in brackets) were:-
Workplace inadequately staffed -- 66% (52%), able to provide a
satisfactory service -- 37% (70%), unable to provide a satisfactory
service -- 61% (29%), too much work to do -- 57% (26%), insufficient
time to do their work -- 68% (22%), not enough support staff -- 37%
(4%), aspects of the job stressful -- 92% (80%), had to cancel or delay
treatments -- 69% (45%), unable to take proper meal breaks -- 64% (45%),
worked unpaid overtime in previous week -- 58% (52%), had considered
leaving the NHS during the previous year -- 51%.
Of the sample, 69% felt they were unfairly paid, compared with 58% in
1993, and more than a quarter of PAM staff undertook work outside the
NHS to supplement their income. More than 95% believed the Pay Review
Body and nationally determined pay increases were important, while 77%
said local pay bargaining would lead to a fall in morale.

Srinagar, Wednesday
CONTACT has been broken with the Kashmiri kidnappers holding two
Britons and two other Western hostages, Indian officials confirmed
today.
They said they had failed for a second day to speak to the Al-Faran
guerrillas, reinforcing the fears of the wives and girlfriends of the
missing men who appealed yesterday for their safe release.
''There is no contact since Monday evening,'' said a spokesman for the
Jammu-Kashmir state government. He said negotiators were trying to
contact the kidnappers by two-way radio.
Al-Faran wants to swop Britons Keith Mangan, 33, and Paul Wells, 23;
American Donald Hutchings, 42; and 26-year-old German Dirk Hasert for 15
jailed Kashmiri militants. But India has refused.
A fifth hostage, American John Childs, escaped four days after being
kidnapped on July 4. Three weeks ago, a sixth captive, Norwegian Hans
Christian Ostro, was beheaded.
Since late 1989 dozens of Muslim militant groups have been fighting
for the independence of Jammu-Kashmir, the only predominantly Muslim
state in mostly Hindu India.
India has deployed tens of thousands of troops in the state, and about
12,000 people have been killed in the fighting.
The group, unknown before the kidnappings, has threatened to kill the
other hostages unless their demands are met.
An Indian spokesman said the militants did not indicate during the
last contact when the kidnappers would call back.
India has all but ruled out a rescue raid because of the risk to the
captive tourists' lives.
Yesterday in New Delhi the female partners of the four hostages
renewed an appeal for their release and said the prolonged crisis only
eroded Western sympathy for the militants' cause.
Meanwhile, security forces braced for renewed separatist violence in
the Kashmir valley in the wake of a bomb blast in the heart of Srinagar,
the state's summer capital on Monday.
At least 13 people, including civilians and security men, were killed
in the car bomb blast, the biggest since the separatist revolt erupted
in 1990.--AP/Reuter.

eyewitnesses, contacted by telephone, said they believed the blast, in
the Eucalyptus district, also wounded an undetermined number of people.
It was the fourth car bomb in less than a week.

BOSTON: A long-term medical study has provided new evidence that
regular use of aspirin can help guard against colon and rectal cancer.
Researchers involved in the 19-year Nurses Health Study concluded that
taking four to six aspirin tablets a week -- a little more than the
half-tablet a day recommended to protect against heart attacks -- can
reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by as much as 44%.

Madrid
POLICE today launched an investigation involving the British community
after a bar owner was found brutally murdered in the Canary Islands.
Detectives at the resort of Las Cristianos, on the south coast of
Tenerife, believe that Michael O'Hara, 39, from Wakefield, Yorkshire,
was the victim of a gangland murder.
He was found gagged and with his head smashed in on the floor of
Little Stevie's Bar early yesterday.
A police spokesman said: ''We won't say what line of inquiry we are
following but it is true to say that we are taking a close look at
members of this large British community in the area.''
UK residents spoke of a series of violent acts in the last few months
in British-owned bars in the area, including stabbings and beatings.
One British businessman said: ''You've only got to take a walk past
these bars to notice the large numbers of heavies about.
''It's no secret that there is a major drug problem down here and
money being laundered is one of the major rackets.
''There are timeshare touts on every corner and they are involved in
many shady deals.''
A British woman, who has worked in the area for several years, said:
''There has been talk of a Mafia-type organisation trying to control the
dozens of British-owned bars.      ''Many owners seem to come and go
every few months. It is said that they are frightened off or can't
afford to pay extortion money.''

Tokyo
JAPANESE police said today they had found the remains of a lawyer and
what appeared to be parts of his wife, who disappeared six years ago
after he helped defectors from the Aum doomsday cult.
They arrested a top member of the cult on charges of murdering the
lawyer.
Police found the body parts in the mountains of central Japan after
nearly 1000 officers and forensic scientists had made a search using
power saws to cut through heavy undergrowth and shovels.
The hunt began after members of the Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth
Sect) told police during questioning that a cult hit squad killed the
couple and their infant son and buried their bodies in the mountains, a
police official said.
The lawyer, Tsutsumi Sakamoto, 33 when he disappeared, his wife
Satoko, 29, and their one-year-old son Tatsuhiko vanished from their
flat in Yokohama in 1989, after Sakamoto had become active in a group of
lawyers helping Aum defectors.
The remains of Sakamoto's body, identified through his sex and height,
were found in mountains in Niigata, a prefecture on the Sea of Japan
coast. What appeared to be parts of his wife were uncovered in a valley
in neighbouring Toyama. There was still no sign of the boy's remains.
Police also announced the arrest of Kazuaki Okazaki, 34, one of the
cult's leaders, on charges of murdering Sakamoto.
When the family disappeared, suspicion immediately fell on the cult.
It always denied involvement, but was widely believed to have felt
threatened by the lawyer's activities.
The cult's bearded guru Shoko Asahara is now in prison awaiting trial
on charges of murder and attempted murder over poison gas attacks and
strangling a follower.
Asahara, 40, could be charged with the murder of the Sakamoto family
as early as tomorrow morning, NHK television said. He is scheduled to
appear in court on October 26, at the climax of the trials of 104 Aum
members that started this week.--Reuter.

TORY MPs yesterday hailed a French threat to withdraw from an
agreement on open frontiers as vindication of Britain's opposition to
the policy.
President Jacques Chirac said on Tuesday that his country may pull out
of the Schengen agreement abolishing border controls, after terrorist
attacks in Paris.
He said the fact that people could move easily across frontiers in
Europe facilitated the movement of terrorists.
Britain has not signed the agreement and fiercely opposes EU plans to
open up frontiers.
UK Ministers see the agreement as a direct attack on British
sovereignty and fear it would interfere with controls on the movement of
would-be terrorists and illegal immigrants.
Leading Tory Euro-sceptic Richard Shepherd, MP for Aldridge
Brownhills, said of President Chirac's comments: ''This reinforces the
Government's proper concerns and fears about border controls.
''I wholly understand why he would take a step like this, particularly
in the light of the current wave of bombings.''
Sir George Gardiner, vice chairman of the Tory backbench foreign
affairs committee, said: ''President Chirac's words bear out all the
anxieties that the British Government has expressed.
''It is a total justification of our position. At least we need not
fear any further pressure from France for us to drop our border
controls.''
Seven EU states -- France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands,
Luxembourg and Belgium -- are currently committed to abolition of border
controls between them. French withdrawal could bring the whole process
to a halt.--PA.

Beijing
THE United States and China tussled for a second day over human rights
at a world women's conference today while behind the scenes charges flew
of an ''Unholy Alliance'' wanting to roll back sexual equality.
US ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright teamed up with
First Lady Hillary Clinton to criticise China's treatment of women
activists at the conference.
Both sides also had different versions of why the first lady's top
aides were left standing in the rain during one of her speeches.
As the clock ticked down on the last hours of Clinton's two-day visit,
China maintained a studied silence on replying to the US charges which
include denunciation of Beijing's population control policies.
''No women -- whether in Birminghan, Bombay, Beirut or Beijing --
should be forcibly sterilised or forced to have an abortion,'' Albright
told a plenary session of the UN's Fourth World Conference on Women.
''It is unconscionable . . . that the right to free expression has
been called into question right here, at a conference conducted under
the auspices of the UN and whose very purpose is the free and open
discussion of women's rights.''
One hour away at a parallel conference of non-governmental
organisations, Clinton repeated criticism of Chinese treatment of
thousands of women activists who have flooded into the country for a
meeting held only once every 10 years.
Many women said they had trouble getting visas and had been harassed
and put under police surveillance.
''I know that you have had to endure severe frustrations here as you
do your work,'' Clinton said to cheers.
When rain forced her to change at the last minute from an outdoor to
indoor venue for the speech Clinton found out at first hand what some
activists said they had been through.
Guards made Donna Shalala, head of the Health and Human Services
Department and co-chair of the American delegation, and Assistant
Secretary of State Winston Lord, a former US ambassador to China, stand
in the rain for 30 minutes before they were allowed into the building
where she spoke.
However, the incident did persuade China to slightly lift the virtual
news blackout on the first lady's visit.
''As the US side suddenly switched the venue . . . to the Non
Governmental Organisation (NGO) forum in Huairou this morning, many
participants could not enter the hall and were dissatisfied,'' the
official Xinhua news agency said.
''Many participants said that they were indignant at the act of the US
side,'' Xinhua said.
The drama was not all at the freewheeling NGO site.
In the main convention centre, Amnesty International said some
governments determined to roll back freedoms won for women were
attempting to sabotage the meeting.
Pierre Sane, Amnesty's executive secretary, declined to single out any
country but said the biggest danger to the conference came from nations
seeking to thwart attempts by women to have the same rights as men.
Debate over human rights by the 185 government delegations to the UN
gathering could make or break the meeting, he told a news conference.
''We all hope it makes it. But we know there are some governments that
are out to break the conference,'' he said.
At the last big UN conference in Cairo last year on population and
development, the Vatican and its close voting allies, including Ecuador
and Malta, were seen by opponents as trying to curb women's rights by
objecting to wording giving women full power over their own bodies.
There is now a fear the so-called ''Cairo clique'' has been replaced
in Beijing by an ''Unholy Alliance'' grouping the Holy See with militant
Islam nations led by Iran that want to break a fragile consensus that
emerged in Egypt.--Reuter.

Larnaca
BLOODY palm prints found on a beach buggy said to have been used to
abduct a Danish tour guide belonged to two British soldiers charged with
beating her to death, a Cyprus court was told today.
A police prosecution expert testified at the court in Larnaca that
smears of blood were found in several places in a yellow beach buggy
three soldiers allegedly used to abduct 23-year-old Louise Jensen.
Inspector Aristophanes Charalambous, head of the fingerprints section
of the Cyprus police, said bloody palm prints belonging to defendants
Alan Ford, 26, and Jeff Pernell, 23, were found on the car.
He did not find any prints matching those of the third defendant,
Justin Fowler, 27.
Fowler's lawyer Christos Pourgourides would not accept Charalambous'
conclusion that what was found on the car was actually blood, due to the
inspector's lack in qualifications in haematology.
Fowler is said to have driven the beach buggy which prosecutors say
was used to knock Jensen and her Cypriot boyfriend off a motorcycle near
the resort of Ayia Napa last September.
It is alleged the soldiers then bundled her into the vehicle and drove
towards the village of Paralimni three miles away, where they beat her
to death with a spade.
All three defendants deny the charges.--Reuter.

Los Angeles
A BLACK former Marine arrested by Mark Fuhrman on a charge he was
later cleared of testified today that the former detective, a key
prosecution witness in the O J Simpson double-murder trial, called him a
''nigger''.
Roderick Hodge said after Fuhrman had put him in a police patrol car
in January 1987, he turned to him and said: ''I told you we'd get you,
nigger.''
The computer engineer, who now lives in Chicago, was the fourth
defence witness to testify that Fuhrman, who claimed to have found the
bloody glove on Simpson's estate the morning after the football hero's
ex-wife and her friend were murdered, frequently used racial epithets.
The racial prejudice of the detective has become a central issue in
the Simpson murder trial because the defence would like to show that
Fuhrman is a white racist capable of planting the glove to frame
Simpson, who is black.
Fuhrman testified months ago that he had not used the word ''nigger''
in the last 10 years. The evidence that Fuhrman has indeed used the
explosive word is seen as a major blow to prosecutors, who have relied
on strong but less emotionally charged DNA evidence to make the case
that Simpson is the murderer.
In response to defence attorney Johnnie Cochran, Hodge said Fuhrman's
voice contained ''anger, hatred, something from deep inside, if you
would. Just something very ugly.''
Screenwriter Laura McKinny, seen as the most damaging of the racial
epithet witnesses, came under attack from the prosecution today
following her testimony yesterday that Fuhrman used the racial epithet
on 42 occasions during 10 years of taped interviews with her that ended
in 1994.
Prosecutor Christopher Darden suggested McKinny was being less than
truthful about whether she had tried to sell the explosive ''Fuhrman
tapes,'' but she insisted: ''They are not for sale.''
Simpson, a football hero turned sportscaster, has pleaded not guilty
in the June 12, 1994, deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald
Goldman.--Reuter.

Pale
BOSNIAN Serb leader Radovan Karadzic pleaded today for Nato to end its
air attacks. He insisted his army had lifted the siege of Sarajevo and
had been trying to withdraw heavy weapons, making Nato strikes
unnecessary.
''Please stop it,'' he said on television.
His appeals, however, failed to deflect the attacks. At Nato southern
headquarters in Naples, a spokesman brushed aside his remarks.
''He said nothing that indicated the Serbs are being anything but
defiant,'' said Captain Jim Mitchell.
Even as the Nato spokesman was dismissing the plea, Bosnian Serb
television interrupted programmes to report fresh air attacks on the
Lukavica barracks south-west of Sarajevo.
British and French artillery later fired on a Bosnian Serb mortar
position they detected had hurled two rounds towards the Mount Igman
road out of Sarajevo, the United Nations said.
British and French units of the Rapid Reaction Force (RRF) positioned
on Igman responded with a dozen rounds from British 155mm guns and six
rounds from French mortars. There was no information on damage.
At the Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale, Mr Karadzic said: ''We are
under terrible attack by Nato. They are bombarding us so terribly that
it hasn't been seen since the Second World War in Europe. This is
terrible aggression on a small Serbian nation.''
His remarks lacked the defiance of his army chief, General Ratko
Mladic, who has consistently condemned the raids as an outrage which
would only make the Serbs stronger.
However, Mr Karadzic insisted that he, not General Mladic, was running
the self-declared Bosnian Serb republic. ''I am in charge,'' he said.
Looking tired, he claimed: ''We have reopened the city of Sarajevo. It
is not blocked any longer. We are ready to open the airport.
''We have withdrawn as much heavy weaponry as we could, but we can't
withdraw what people possess in order to protect themselves.''
In an appeal to both the UN and Nato he said: ''We are simply
protecting Serb suburbs that happen to be surrounding Sarajevo, so
please stop it because you have enough reason to stop it.''
It fell on deaf ears. Nato aircraft blasted more Bosnian Serb targets,
but spared units still dug in near Sarajevo to give them a chance to
comply with UN demands to pull out.
The last message from Mladic came on Monday. ''We gather that he's in
a defiant mode as we speak and we hope that his mode will change. For
him every day of Nato air strikes means that his army is being clobbered
and clobbered and clobbered,'' said UN spokesman Alexander Ivanko.
There had still been no Serb response to the UN order to remove heavy
weapons from the 12-mile exclusion zone around the besieged Bosnian
capital.
Nato said that in the past 24 hours just one Serb weapon had been
detected moving, and that was inside the the exclusion zone.
Ivanko said Nato jets and the RRF artillery were ''deliberately not
attacking positions which were silent and which are not perceived as an
immediate threat to allow them to be moved''.
Lieutenant-Colonel Chris Vernon said: ''We do not intend to harass the
Bosnian Serb Army heavy weapons around Sarajevo in order that they may
comply with the withdrawal demand.'' But he added: ''If they open fire
or threaten to they will be targeted.''
In Naples, the Alliance's southern region commander said French and
American fighter-bombers used laser-guided bombs and rockets to take out
ammunition dumps and a radio control centre in three strikes today.
In those raids, according to Admiral Leighton Smith, French Mirages
and American F-16s and F-18s hit ammunition dumps at Visegrad, near the
border with Serbia, and at Hadzici, west of Sarajevo, and a radio centre
at Bosnian Serb military headquarters at Han Pijesak.
Meanwhile, American peace envoy Richard Holbrooke continued the
twin-track, carrot-and-stick approach to handling the Bosnian crisis by
briefing Croatian President Franjo Tudjman in Zagreb and denying that
Washington was trying to bomb the Bosnian Serbs to the negotiating
table.
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, visiting Turkey, said the military
action against Bosnian Serbs should continue if necessary, but it could
not alone bring the civil war to an end: peace talks were the only
viable solution.
He said the removal of the arms embargo also would not provide a
solution to the conflict and that peace talks were the only viable
solution.
''Neither we nor the majority of our partners, and certainly not the
US administration, have ever believed that a solution would be achieved
in the battlefield,'' he said.
Backing the mission of the US peace envoy he said: ''The best
prospects of peace in Bosnia is the success of that diplomatic
initiative.''
Bad weather over Bosnia kept RAF pilots on the ground today,
preventing them inspecting the results of yesterday's Nato raids against
the Bosnian Serbs.
Pilots based at Gioia del Colle, southern Italy, had been expected to
fly reconnaissance missions this morning to take photographs of the
effects of yesterday's Nato airstrikes.
But they were grounded by thunderstorms, low cloud and poor visibility
over the war zone.
It was hoped they would get airborne later, and an RAF spokesman at
the base said: ''Planes are on full alert, and ready to go.''
The missions were to assess damage caused by an RAF raid from the
base, and also strikes carried out by other allied pilots.
Two Harriers from the base, directed by a Jaguar, dropped 1000lb
laser-guided bombs today on an ammunition dump south of Sarajevo,
hitting their targets.
However, a second wave of three Harriers and a Jaguar returned to
Italy without dropping as the weather closed in.
Meanwhile, Nato said it was sceptical of reports that the Bosnian
Serbs had captured two downed French airmen and said the Alliance was
using all necessary resources to find and rescue them.
They were in a Mirage 2000 that was shot down by a heat-seeking
missile near Pale during the air strikes last week.
A spokesman said no firm evidence had been produced to support reports
quoting Serb military sources as saying the airmen were being held.
''They haven't shown us any evidence they have them,'' he said. ''We
would not assume these stories to be true. We have seen no compelling
evidence that the Serbs have them.''
In Paris, French Defence Minister Charles Millon said the pilot and
navigator had used their emergency signalling devices to be located, and
President Jacques Chirac has asked Nato to use all available means to
rescue them.
There were reports of attacks on communications posts and other sites
over a wide area of Bosnia today.
* Nato air strikes have killed about 100 civilians since they were
launched a week ago, the Bosnian Serb Army alleged in a statement late
today.
Calling the attacks ''unscrupulous and barbaric'' the statement from
the army general staff, published by the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug,
said hundreds of other civilians were wounded.
Bosnian Serb authorities have taken reporters to view what they say
are civilian sites damaged in the latest round of Nato attacks.--Reuter.

Table unavailable!!
A LATE summer surge of four points by the SNP does little to break
Labour's hold in Scotland, according to the latest poll by System Three
for The Herald.
The poll provides a final snapshot of the state of the parties before
an autumn conference season which is seen as marking the start of the
run-in to the next General Election, even although that could still be
more than 18 months away.
This month's showing of Labour on 52%, ahead of the SNP on 26% -- with
the Conservatives on 12% and the Liberal Democrats slipping back to 8%
-- provides a benchmark for what looks like being a long and hard-fought
campaign.
Labour, although slipping five points in two months, will be heartened
by persistent polling above 50% throughout this year, while this month's
four-point rise in SNP fortunes to 26% comes before its Perth conference
in a fortnight.
For the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, however, the survey shows
the scale of the task they face.
Due to a transmission error in last month's poll the shares of the
Tories (who should have been credited up one point on 12%) and the
Scottish Liberal Democrats (who were up three to 11% rather than up four
to 12%) were transposed.
Now the Liberal Democrats find the encouragement of their local
election results slipping away and any spin-off from the Lancashire
parliamentary by-election evaporating as they settle to the same 8%
figure as in July.
The difficulty facing Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth can be put in
perspective by comparing his party's standings with that during the last
period of late-term blues running into a General Election.
This summer has seen ratings of 11% or 12%. In 1990, when Mr Forsyth
was completing his turbulent spell as party chairman in Scotland, the
figures ranged between 17% and 22%. The 1990 average figure for the
Tories was 18.6%. For this year so far it is 11.6%.
Matching the Houdini-like achievement of 26% at the last General
election will be an even taller order this time.
Labour party chiefs in Glasgow's Kier Hardie House are delighted that
they haven't taken a beating over a succession of rows prompted by
increasing tension between the right and left wings of the party and
inter-party war over Labour's devolution plans.
Mr Jack McConnell, general secretary of the Scottish Labour Party, was
upbeat, saying: ''We consistently show record levels of support and the
very firm statement by Tony Blair this week dispelling any doubts about
Labour's commitment to a new parliament for Scotland will ensure the
majority position for us in the coming months.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party's results were ''hugely
satisfying''. He predicted the Braveheart movie publicity effect would
be felt in the next poll, pushing the SNP into a stronger position
before its conference.
Mr Andy Myles, chief executive of the Scottish Liberal Democrat Party,
said the results were ''disappointing'', adding that summer polls tended
to fluctuate.
Conservative Party chairman Sir Michael Hirst said: ''I am confident
the very vigorous approach being taken by Michael Forsyth and his
ministerial team will boost our results.''
The poll was conducted among 1045 voters in 40 constituencies between
August 24 and 29. The results exclude the 16% who had not decided, would
not say, or did not know how they would vote in a General Election.

THE Labour Party has promised to introduce legislation to make age
discrimination illegal if it wins the next election.
The promise comes in a letter from Mr Ian McCartney, the Shadow
Employment Minister, to the Association of Retired Persons Over 50.
Mr McCartney writes: ''The next Labour government will introduce
legislation to make age discrimination illegal, just as discrimination
on the grounds of race and sex are today.
''We are talking with a group of experts to decide exactly what form
this legislation might take. Our commitment, however, is clear: age
discrimination has no place in a modern society and we will take steps
to remove it.''
Earlier, in the reply to a letter from the association, which
represents the interests of 18 million over-50s, the MP writes: ''If we
throw people out of the labour market at 40-plus, many families will not
be able to maintain themselves without becoming reliant on state support
and the state will simply not be able to keep up with the costs of age
discrimination.
''Discrimination is morally wrong. Work gives people a sense of
dignity and purpose and older people are as entitled to this dignity as
anyone else.''
Welcoming Labour's commitment, Mr Don Steele, the association's
executive director, said: ''This is the first time that any major
political party has promised legislation to end age discrimination and
represents a major breakthrough.''
He said that age discrimination was rife in all phases of employment,
including hiring practices, promotion opportunities, and training as
well as in the provision of credit cards, credit itself and, in some
cases, voluntary work.
Mr Steele said: ''We have been lobbying for some time for the
statutory banning of all aspects of age discrimination in the workplace,
allied to a flexible decade of retirement and the prohibition of
mandatory retirement on the grounds of age rather than ability.
''The Labour Party's pledge will go a long way towards turning the
tide against the practice of excluding older people from employment by
means of early retirement and voluntary redundancy.''

ANTI-NUCLEAR demonstrators yesterday demanded a boycott of all French
goods as they staged a 24-hour rooftop protest at the French Consulate
in Edinburgh after the nuclear test in the South Pacific.
The vigil came as French staff at the neighbouring Institut Francais
faxed a letter of protest to President Jacques Chirac, condemning the
testing as ''unjustified and unjustifiable''.
The number of demonstrators outside the consulate swelled to 100 last
night for the remaining three hours of the protest.
They were joined by Mr Tam Dalyell, MP for West Lothian. He said they
were doing something extremely important by ''telling our friends in
France that their friends have strong feelings about what has
happened''.
Three protesters climbed on to the roof of the four-storey consulate
in the city's New Town at 9.30pm on Tuesday, as it was revealed the
first test had taken place at Mururoa.
The environmentalists, from Greenpeace, CND, Friends of the Earth, and
the Faslane Peace Camp, stuck radiation warning notices and twisted tape
around the entrance to the building.
Earlier, police had used bolt cutters to free the front door of the
consulate, which had been barricaded by protesters.
Inspector Bob Licznerski said police would continue to monitor the
situation, but the environmentalists had the right to demonstrate.
Motorists sounded horns in support as they spotted the huge protest
banners.
The protest was one of a number at French consulates around the world.
More than 50 delegates from 13 countries, meeting at the World
Congress of the International Union of Local Authorities at The Hague,
also passed a resolution condemning the testing and appealed to the
French president to abandon the programme.
In London, Greenpeace and CND called for demonstrations outside the
French embassy.
Greenpeace estimated 300-400 people turned up, but Scotland Yard put
the figure at 50 and said there were no arrests.

LABOUR warned yesterday that it would review all aspects of nuclear
privatisation when it gained office, writes STEPHEN McGREGOR.
Industry spokesman Brian Wilson said that Labour reserved the right to
''alter the balance of risk'' both in respect of the industry's
insurance liability and the bill for decommissioning.
He warned Trade Secretary Ian Lang: ''You are not going to have any
easier a ride over nuclear privatisation than over Post Office or rail
privatisation.''

BRITAIN yesterday refused to become embroiled in the international
protest which greeted France's nuclear test in the Pacific.
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind maintained Britain's refusal to
criticise the French, and insisted: ''It is, at the end of the day, a
matter for the French Government.'' However, he did indicate that
Britain wanted the number of tests to be strictly limited, and warned
that they must not be allowed to interfere with the eventual agreement
of a worldwide test ban treaty.
Labour described the resumption of testing by the French as a
''flagrant breach'' of the spirit of the existing nuclear
non-proliferation treaty. The Shadow Defence Secretary, Dr David Clark,
said Britain should join the international chorus of denunciation of
what he called ''this deplorable act''. The Liberal Democrat Defence
spokesman, Mr Menzies Campbell, said the testing was ''scientifically
unnecessary and politically inept''.
Mr Edward McMillan-Scott, Tory MEP for North York, voiced support for
the French, saying: ''If we are to have a common foreign and security
policy in Europe that means anything at all, we need adequate weaponry,
including a nuclear capability at the present time.''

THE Scottish Secretary yesterday poured soothing oil over the
much-troubled waters covering the ferry routes to Orkney and Shetland.
Local MP Jim Wallace and leaders of the islands' councils emerged from
a meeting with Mr Forsyth confident of a new dialogue with St Andrew's
House and consultation over subsidies.
The meeting was called in the wake of revelations in The Herald last
month about how Mr Forsyth's predecessor, Mr Ian Lang, disregarded
recommendations in a consultants' report on support for ferry
operations.
Mr Wallace said: ''We got further today than we ever did with Ian Lang
on this issue. If this discussion had taken place 12 months earlier and
before they made the announcement, we would have avoided all the
anxieties it caused. It is amazing it has taken so long. His officials
are now being told to engage in dialogue with the islands' councils
which was never the case before.''
The islands' councils are seeking long-term assurances for the
services beyond 1997 and a variety of routes to avoid a monopoly by a
single freight carrier. In Orkney's case, there is particular concern to
preserve the Invergordon to Kirkwall livestock service and for Shetland
the right type of ships to serve future needs.
Canon Lewis Smith, convener of the Shetland Islands Council, said Mr
Forsyth had also promised to keep freight costs under review. ''We had a
good hearing. We have been given an undertaking that his officials,
together with the councils, will look at the system as it is proposed
and see how it can be provided within the finance available,'' said Mr
Smith.
Meanwhile, Mr Forsyth will today spell out his vision on how local
government will develop amid fears of drastic upheavals as the new
councils take control next April.
He is due to address the Scottish conference of the Institute of
Revenues Rating and Valuation in Peebles in his new guise as a listening
Minister. This will contrast with his last appearance at the IRRV
Scottish conference at Aviemore in 1990 when he was enthralled with the
joys of poll tax.

THE Government authority that safeguards against radioactive pollution
was yesterday accused of being ''irresponsible'' for allowing
reprocessing of foreign waste to restart at Dounreay, after last month
opposing the positioning of a wave power generator off the nuclear
plant.
Her Majesty's Industrial Pollution Inspectorate was also criticised
for its lack of concern about particles on the Dounreay foreshore, which
elsewhere would be classed as highly radioactive waste. These particles,
fatal if ingested, are regarded as insignificant because there is little
chance of anyone coming into contact with them.
Mr Graham Stein of Friends of the Earth Scotland said yesterday:
''Dounreay is forever telling us that things must be safe because the
regulatory bodies' strict standards have been satisfied.
''But it gives you some insight into how HMIPI thinks when you
consider that the first proactive step this regulatory body has taken in
the 40-year history of Dounreay is to try and stop a wave generator.
''Surely if it was right to try and stop Osprey until they find out
the source of the contamination, it must be totally irresponsible to
allow reprocessing, a known source of the contamination, to start again
while they are still trying to find the path.
''As for the particles on the beach, it had already been stated by the
leader of the investigation that if one of these particles was ingested
it would probably result in death within a week.
''So it simply is not good enough to say there aren't enough particles
to worry about,'' said Mr Stein.
As The Herald revealed last month, the inspectorate expressed
reservations about siting Osprey, the world's first wave generator, in
the Pentland Firth while a search for radioactive particles was under
way.
A spokesman said at the time: ''While the investigations are ongoing
into the particles, and we are trying to establish where the
contamination is coming from and how extensive it is, we just feel it is
not the most sensible thing to do to have a wave machine offshore and
have engineers tying it down and working on it.''
HMIPI's concerns were not to last long, as the Osprey sank shortly
after arriving in the Pentland Firth.
Yesterday a Scottish Office spokesman said that HMIPI would have no
objections to Dounreay's intention to start a short campaign of
reprocessing for European and British customers next month, or that it
might complicate the contamination work.
''Reprocessing has always gone on at Dounreay and there is no reason
to believe it will pose any problem now,'' said the spokesman.
The Scottish Office also brushes off HMIPI's critics' concerns
regarding foreshore contamination, in spite of its reported high
radioactivity.
The spokesman stated: ''The assessment of the radiological
significance of the particles found on the Dounreay foreshore included
the nature of the particles and the likelihood of any member of the
public coming into contact with them.
''Some of the particles recovered were of significant activity but the
assessment showed the chances of anyone coming into contact with them
inadvertently was very low indeed.
''As there was virtually no risk of anyone suffering harm as a result
of the particles on the foreshore their presence was conidered
insignificant in radiological terms.''
Anti-nuclear activists found the contrasting importance attached by
HMIPI to the different issues very revealing.
Mr Geoffrey Minter, a nearby landowner chosen on Tuesday to chair a
new group which is concerned that the news about Dounreay is damaging
Caithness, particularly in tourism, said:''Obviously when there are
objections to something like Osprey but not to reprocessing, the public
can be excused from thinking they have got things the wrong way round.
''I believe that reprocessing is safe as long as the emissions are
controlled. But it appears no longer enough just to say we have been
doing it for 40 years so it must be safe.
''Dounreay must accept that more needs to be done to satisfy an
increasingly concerned public in 1995.''

DARLINDA, Scotland's best- known clairvoyant, has died aged 55.
In everyday life, she was Mrs Rita Madhok, wife of Dr Rajan Madhok, a
specialist in rheumatology at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. She was a
diabetic who had had a history of kidney failure and received a
transplant in 1987.
Her new kidney failed recently and she had been receiving daily
dialysis treatment at Glasgow's Western Infirmary since July. She died
on Tuesday night.
Darlinda had written a regular astrology column for the Sunday Mail
for the last 16 years and was Scotland's first registered clairvoyant.
Despite her illness, she was a tireless worker for charity and had
raised nearly #200,000 for kidney research. Recently, she left a
treatment session at the infirmary to go straight to a charity ball she
had organised.
Mr Jim Cassidy, editor of the Sunday Mail, said last night:
''Thousands of Scots have lost someone who had won a place in their
hearts. They might never have met her but Darlinda was their friend. Her
name had become part of the Scottish vocabulary. A remarkably talented,
honest, and warm lady who touched everyone she met with her special
brand of magic.''
Two years ago, the former civil servant with the Inland Revenue was
honoured at the Glasgow City Chambers for her charity work. Previously
Mrs Rita Davidson, she has two adult children, Selina and Gary, from her
first marriage.

<HEADLINE>Doctor claims staff were threatened over giving evidence</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>976503043</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A HEALTH board general manager is alleged to have threatened staff
that if they gave evidence in support of a consultant at a disciplinary
hearing it would be a ''terminal career event''.
The allegation was made by Dr Iain MacLean, chief administrative
medical officer with Dumfries and Galloway Health Board, in a
confidential internal memo written three months before the hearing.
The general manager, Mr Derek Banks, yesterday strongly denied having
made the threat.
The memo relates to the case of Dr David Clow who at the time it was
written was a consultant paediatrician with Dumfries and Galloway
Community Health Trust.
Copies of the memos were obtained by Dr Clow's legal advisers and were
produced at his disciplinary hearing in July. Dr MacLean and members of
his staff subsequently gave evidence.
Dr Clow was dismissed after the disciplinary hearing at which the
trust board found his behaviour at work had been ''inappropriate''.
It accepted evidence that he had verbally harassed staff, breached
protocol, and failed to adhere to a written warning, but stressed it had
heard nothing to lead it to doubt his clinical competence.
Dr Clow, 53, of Dumfries, claims he has been unjustly treated and is
appealing to Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth on the grounds of unfair
dismissal.
Dr MacLean said yesterday he stood by everything he wrote in his memo
which is addressed to three doctors on his staff and is dated April 21,
1995.
In it, he refers to a meeting the previous day with Mr Banks who had
come to see him about two issues and goes on: ''The first issue was
innocuous enough (concerning departmental accommodation) but the second
gives me considerable cause for concern.
''In effect, he advised me he was feeling somewhat vulnerable in the
David Clow affair, in as much as he felt that Dr Clow was approaching a
number of board employees, and might be suggesting to them that he (Mr
Banks) was out to get him.
''The implication was that Dr Clow was attempting to collect
ammunition to support this notion.
''He then went on to state that if any health board employee were to
support Dr Clow against him, they would not be working for the health
board in future.
''This threat, as it can only be described, was repeated and the
outcome of any such action by a health board employee described as 'a
terminal career event'.''
Dr MacLean's memo adds that Mr Banks preceded his remarks with the
hint that some board employees might not hold him in particularly high
esteem and might consider ''putting the boot in''.
The memo continues: ''He went on to observe that he was looking
particularly at this department . . . I resisted the strong temptation
to upbraid him there and then.
''Apart from the gross implied insult to the integrity of this
department and its staff, this threatening behaviour worries me deeply.
It is morally and ethically indefensible. In effect it amounts to a
threat of dismissal to any member of staff who might be called upon to
give evidence . . .''
The memo concludes: ''Were any hint of this behaviour to become known
to Dr Clow or his advisers, the position of the board and possibly the
Community Services Trust in the forthcoming disciplinary hearing would
be effectively undermined.''
In a second confidential internal memo, of the same date, Dr MacLean
refers to a second conversation with Mr Banks six and a half hours after
their first meeting.
He states that Mr Banks commented to the effect: ''What I was saying
earlier on, it doesn't apply to you. I really had your two colleagues in
mind. I don't think there would be any problem if you were to give
evidence.''
Dr MacLean adds that he had made an appointment with the board
chairman, Mrs Jean Tulloch: ''. . . to convey my concerns that Mr
Banks's actions of late do not appear to be rational''.
Dr MacLean confirmed yesterday he had written the memos and added: ''I
have no means of corroborating what Mr Banks said in April. It was a
one-to-one meeting.
''But I stand by what I wrote. There is an important principle
involved.''
Mr Banks, in a response issued through the health board's
communications manager, said: ''I strongly refute having made the
alleged threats to staff referred to in the memo by Dr MacLean.''

<RECORDNO>976503044</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A MAN who shot a 2am caller at point-blank range outside his
grandfather's house in Linlithgow was jailed for six years yesterday.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard that, two weeks before the shooting,
Louis Sheppard, 25, had nearly been killed in a vicious hammer attack in
London.
After learning that the people who had attacked him were still looking
for him, he came north to Linlithgow to hide out, armed with a
semi-automatic pistol for his ''protection''.
The court was told that Sheppard, from Deptford, London, feared that
his London past might be catching up with him, but instead shot a
doorstep rowdy.
Sentencing Sheppard, Lord Mayfield said he took into account that,
while on remand, he had prevented ''a potentially serious incident'' in
Edinburgh's Saughton jail, when he stopped an attack on a prison
officer.
Sheppard's victim, Mr Colin Williamson, was taken to hospital with a
gunshot wound to his right thigh which narrowly missed hitting a main
artery.
Unemployed Sheppard yesterday admitted assaulting Mr Williamson, c/o
Livingston police, on May 21 this year in Preston Crescent, Linlithgow,
by shooting him on the leg to his severe injury and to the danger of his
life. He also pled guilty to having a firearm and ammunition without
holding a firearms certificate.
Advocate-depute Scott Brady told the court that Sheppard, a
father-of-two, had previous convictions for drugs and dishonesty
offences.
On the night of the shooting he had met a couple in Linlithgow and
invited them back to watch a video. However, Mr Williamson had spotted
them and turned up at the door at 2am. An angry Sheppard answered the
door and complained at his turning up at that time.
There was a confrontation between the men, during which Sheppard
threatened to get a knife and stab Mr Williamson.
Mr Williamson left, only to return shortly afterwards with two others.
This time Sheppard answered the door with the gun and shot Mr Williamson
in the leg at close range.
Sheppard placed his weapon in the garden and sat in the house, waiting
for the police to arrive.
Mr Donald Findlay, QC, defending, said that Sheppard was the victim of
a savage hammer assault in London on May 8 this year, during which he
suffered a broken arm and depressed skull fracture. Medical experts
reckoned he was one blow away from death.
As soon as he was released from hospital he set off for Scotland,
after receiving further threats.
Mr Findlay said Mr Williamson had turned up at the house in Linlithgow
in an aggressive mood, looking for one of the people Sheppard had
invited back with him.
He added that Sheppard had been not unreasonably angry ''at some
drunken lout coming to the door at two in the morning, looking for
trouble''.
After the initial doorstep confrontation Mr Williamson returned again
with others ''and was quite clearly looking to cause further trouble'',
said Mr Findlay. He said that Sheppard panicked and fired the gun,
fearing the early-morning visit could be linked to the London attack on
him.
Mr Findlay said that it was ''a measure of the man'' that he could
read to the court a letter from the deputy governor of Saughton jail,
which revealed that Sheppard had prevented an attack on a prison officer
on June 4 while being held as a remand prisoner.
He had placed himself between the isolated officer and an inmate
intent on attacking him and persuaded other prisoners not to get
involved in the incident.
Lord Mayfield told Sheppard: ''The courts take a very serious view of
firearms offences . . . particularly as in this case the firing of a
handgun at point-blank range.''
But the judge added that he would take into account the particular
circumstances involved in the incident and the letter from the prison
official in jailing him for six years.

A MOTHER found dead in a pool of water after stabbing her three
children was a ''paranoid individual'' obsessed with an ex-boyfriend
whom she believed had supernatural powers, an inquest was told
yesterday.
South Norfolk Coroner Andrew Barker recorded an open verdict on
29-year-old Joy Senior and verdicts of unlawful killing on her three
children Kurtis, seven, Cherelle, five, and Clinton, three.
They were stabbed on a bed at Miss Senior's home in Thetford, Norfolk,
in May.
Miss Senior's body was found face down in a pool of water in a wood
several miles away. She had slashed her wrists and throat, but died from
drowning.
The coroner said that although Miss Senior had switched on the gas at
her home, slashed herself and crashed her car, he could not rule out the
possibility that she had tripped when she fell into the pool and that
she might therefore have died accidentally.
A statement read to the inquest at Diss in Norfolk from psychiatrist
Christopher Mayer said Miss Senior had become a ''deep-thinking paranoid
individual'' and was the victim of an acute psychosis.
Part of her illness involved an obsession with her former boyfriend,
Sean Sutherland, whom she believed had supernatural powers.
Mr Sutherland told the inquest he had never pretended to Miss Senior
to have such powers. He left the hearing sitting in the back of a police
car covering his head with his hands.
Miss Senior's brother-in-law, Mr Michael Mitchell, told the hearing
that Mr Sutherland had convinced her he would win the first draw in the
national lottery but only if she kept the news a secret.
When he did not win, Miss Senior appeared to become unhappy and blame
herself for talking about the draw before it happened.
''She thought he was very clever and that he knew a lot of things. He
impressed her in a big way with the way that he talked to her,'' Mr
Mitchell said.
''He started to make Joy think about things more than what she would
have done. He convinced her he was going to win the first draw in the
national lottery.''
Mr Mitchell denied Miss Senior had been depressed.
He said: ''I had never seen her depressed. She seemed to blame herself
because she had confided in someone else and it was something that she
was not supposed to have done.''
Several witnesses told the inquest that Miss Senior, who had worked as
a hairdresser and cleaner, had said Mr Sutherland appeared to have magic
powers.
Mr Jim Francis, a pastor from the Seventh-day Adventist Church in
Norwich, said she had been worried by the gift of a black rose and
necklace from Mr Sutherland, which she thought was a bad omen.
She had told him of another occasion when Mr Sutherland had
demonstrated his powers to her as they queued to pay at a checkout
counter during a Christmas shopping trip.
''He said to her, 'just watch what I'm going to do', and he snapped
his fingers. There was an item for #36 which the cashier put through
without charging for it. She asked him how did he did that and he had
told her that his father was a powerful man.''
Mr Francis added that Miss Senior would not tolerate any criticism of
her boyfriend.
''You could not say anything about Sean,'' he said. She would say:
''Sean was just trying to protect me.''
Mr Sutherland, a baker from Brandon, Suffolk, denied suggesting he had
supernatural powers, claiming Miss Senior came to this conclusion on her
own.
''There were certain events that she read more into,'' he said. ''She
thought I was some kind of guardian angel, but I kept telling her I'm
just a normal person.''
Asked by the coroner if he had any final comments on the tragedy, Mr
Sutherland said: ''It is very easy to blame the Seventh-day Adventists
but I do feel there are some outside forces which have caused her to be
like this. I knew her as a very happy, lovely person.''
Questioned by the father of Miss Senior's children, David Porter, Mr
Sutherland said he thought the most likely outside forces were her
friends and family.

A DRIVER was banned yesterday after a sheriff told him: ''You would
kill someone if I let you back in a car.''
Witnesses told how builder Allan Adey's #40,000 Jaguar went round a
blind bend at ''80mph plus'', veered into the wrong lane, and ploughed
head-on into another vehicle.
The three occupants of the other vehicle, including a two-year-old
boy, were seriously hurt.
The boy's mother, Mrs Gillian Brown, 33, told Dumbarton Sheriff Court
that her injuries were so bad and long-lasting that she has been forced
to give up her career as an intensive care nurse.
Mrs Brown, of Oxhill Road, Dumbarton, was a passenger in a car being
driven by her father, Mr John Halley, 62, on Duntocher Road, Bearsden.
Mr Halley, of Lewis Gardens, Bearsden, told how he saw the Jaguar --
registration number UP U 107 -- skidding towards him.
He said: ''It had sparks flying and smoke billowing from it's wheels.
It was obviously braking and trying to bury itself in the road.''
Mr Halley and his daughter were both detained in hospital with
multiple fractures, and Mr Halley told Sheriff Ronnie Watson: ''We were
damned lucky to survive.'' The child sustained a broken collar-bone.
Adey, of Douglas Park Crescent, Bearsden, claimed he was travelling at
''only 60mph'' in the lead-up to the accident. He said he was forced to
brake sharply to avoid hitting a car which had broken down on his side
of the road.
Sheriff Watson expressed his astonishment when Adey told him he
considered it acceptable driving practice to enter blind bends at such a
high speed.
The sheriff asked him: ''Is it just fate, then, if an obstruction just
happens to be round that corner? What would happen if a three-year-old
child was on the road . . . just kill it?'' Adey replied: ''It could
also be a bulldozer.''
Sheriff Watson found Adey guilty of careless driving and admitted he
was surprised the Crown had not sought to convict him of the more
serious charge of dangerous driving.
He deferred sentence until October 3 because Adey had forgotten to
bring his driving licence to court.
However, he imposed an interim disqualification until that date.

THE political future of ex-Tory Minister Sir Nicholas Scott lay in the
balance last night after his constituency association voted not to
endorse him automatically as its candidate at the next General Election.
It means the Chelsea MP, recently involved in a car accident in which
a child in a pushchair was allegedly knocked over, will have to fight it
out with other candidates to contest the newly created Kensington and
Chelsea seat in London.
His association had the choice last night of either adopting Sir
Nicholas, 61, as the sole candidate or opening up the selection process
so others could throw their hats into the ring. It decided on an open
selection procedure in which Sir Nicholas, who has represented Chelsea
for 21 years, will be one of the candidates.
Sir Nicholas, at his London home, said of the association's decision:
''That always had my support. When the association suggested that
happen, I said I was content with that.'' He declined to comment
further.
No decision has yet been made on any prosecution of Sir Nicholas after
the incident involving the child, which happened as he drove away from a
party. The MP was breathalysed.
He now faces a tough battle for selection for Kensington and Chelsea,
which is likely to remain a Tory stronghold. Former Chancellor Norman
Lamont is among those who could stand against him.
The chairman of the constituency association, Mr John Corbett
Singleton, said: ''In accordance with Sir Nicholas Scott's wishes the
executive of the Kensington and Chelsea Conservative Association has
agreed to open out the selection for the prospective parliamentary
candidate for the enlarged constituency of Kensington and Chelsea.
''This is on the understanding that Sir Nicholas will go through to
the final selection process on November 10.''
One of Sir Nicholas's supporters, Mr Anthony Westmedge, said: ''I am
delighted he is putting his name forward. He is a good man, a terrific
character.''
Sir Nicholas was one of Margaret Thatcher's longest-serving Ministers
but became embroiled in controversy when his daughter, Victoria,
criticised him for not enacting a Labour back-bench Bill to help the
disabled.

A UNION claimed yesterday that it has been ''vindicated'' over the
sacking of one of its Scottish officials following allegations
concerning the cashing of a forged #250 cheque.
Mr Bill Gifford, the former Dundee-based regional organiser of the
GMB, was dismissed in January this year and claimed unfair dismissal at
an industrial tribunal. However, it has emerged that he has now lost his
case against the GMB.
Last night, Mr Bob Thomson, GMB Scottish secretary, said that the
union had received advance notice of the industrial tribunal decision
that Mr Gifford's claim for unfair dismissal had been unsuccessful.
Mr Thomson said: ''We have now been vindicated by an industrial
tribunal.''
Mr Gifford was unavailable for comment last night. The full judgment
is yet to be issued. His solicitor, Mr Tom Murray, said: ''He is very
disappointed at the decision.''

SCOTLAND'S tourist industry was enjoying a marked change of fortune
this year even before the extraordinary summer weather, according to a
survey published today.
The tourism index by the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Scottish
Tourist Board said there was a substantial turnaround in business
confidence across all sectors. The hard-pressed bed and breakfast
market, which had suffered a decline in recent years because of the drop
in UK visitors, had experienced the biggest turnaround.
The smaller tourism operators had shown a 15% increase in business
volume in the second quarter of this year. This was a complete reversal
of last year's figures, when 61% of operators experienced a fall in
business.
During the second quarter of last year, a negative balance of 45% of
operators had expected business to fall but in the same quarter this
year this had reversed to show a positive balance of 14% who expected
business to rise.
Among hotel operators, 20% had achieved an increase compared with
1994, when the figure was 3%.
Mr Ian Grant, chairman of the STB, said the upturn was a welcome boost
after last year's disappointment, but he injected a note of caution.
Recovery was patchy across Scotland and some areas were outperforming
others. The STB would continue to work in partnership with area tourist
boards to increase the spread of visitors throughout the country.
Mr Grant said it was vital the industry continued to work together to
build on the recovery. It was crucial that the product, Scotland as a
holiday destination, was developed.
''This cannot be done,'' he said, ''without increased investment in
facilities and rigorous attention to quality assurance and standards of
service. Only then will first-time visitors return in future years.''
A spokesman for the STB said that although later figures were not yet
available, the warm weather had stimulated tourism and there was a lot
of optimism about the remaining months of the year.
Mr Gerry Mullan, the Royal Bank's tourism economist, said the industry
now had the best opportunity for some time to break the downward cycle
of recent years.
The long-term decline in visitor numbers had affected the Highlands
and Islands the most. In the medium to longer-term, the industry would
require to continue to focus on the short-break market, he said.
The index drew attention to a growing gap in tourism between the
buoyant hotel sector in Glasgow and Edinburgh and the hard-pressed hotel
operators in the Highlands. The Highlands had shown declining hotel
occupancy in the last four years, and at levels below the average for
the last 10 years.
In Glasgow and Edinburgh, however, occupancy was growing. Edinburgh
stood to gain further from the opening this month of its International
Conference Centre.
* The cause of getting more women into senior posts achieved
significant progress yesterday with the appointment of Anne Mearns as
the first chief executive of the new Highlands of Scotland Tourist
Board.
Ms Mearns, 47, currently chief executive of Aberdeen District Council,
was chosen from 217 applicants and a final shortleet of five.
Earlier this year she failed to get the job as chief executive of the
new unitary City of Aberdeen Council -- a decison which disappointed
women activists throughout the country.

A SCOTTISH woman has fallen to her death on a climbing expedition in
the Canadian Rockies.
Mrs Joan Auld, 56, an experienced climber, died after she fell 1000ft
from the summit of Mount Indefatigable in Peter Lougheed Provincial
Park.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Mrs Auld, an archivist at
Dundee University, was with a group climbing several mountains in the
area when the accident happened on Tuesday.
Her husband, James, travelled to Canada as soon as he heard of his
wife's death. The couple, who lived in Dundee, had no children.
Mr John Bagnall, Dundee University librarian, said: ''Joan will be
greatly missed both in her professional capacity and as a personal
friend.
''It is very largely through her personal drive and ability that the
university has developed a reputation as a centre of excellence, both as
an archive and as a commercial workshop for paper conservation and
repair.''
Earlier this year, Mrs Auld's department was awarded grants of over
#250,000 from the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council.

THE future of the telephone was unveiled yesterday only a few miles
from the birthplace of its Victorian inventor, Edinburgh-born Alexander
Graham Bell.
A revolutionary project at Livingston is developing a tiny telephone
which will allow callers to both talk and listen through an earpiece.
Researchers are working on existing technology developed by the Jabra
Corporation of California and predict the hi-tech telephone is months
away.
The development is based on advanced software which allows you to hear
through a lightweight speaker while it also transmits your voice. New
voice recognition software could also allow a driver to ''call home'' by
simply saying the words.
The new telephone could also cut out external noise and echo,
including background voices and passing traffic. The company hopes the
system may also link with the Internet.
Speaking on a visit to the plant yesterday, Jabra's president and
chief executive officer, Mr Randy Granovetter, said: ''It really is
quite exciting to be carrying out this research work so close to the
birthplace of the man who invented the telephone more than a century
ago. But that was really coincidental.
''We were really impressed with the quality and standard of Scotland's
research capabilities and indigenous design talents. We also found
top-notch engineers specialising in wireless, spread spectrum, noise
cancellation, and digital signal processing, all of which are crucial
elements of our project.''

<HEADLINE>Scientists reveal Thalidomide deformities being passed on. Threat to the victims' children</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976503054</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THALIDOMIDE deformities can be passed from generation to generation,
according to some scientists.
Until now, the accepted view of most of the medical establishment had
been that the malformations caused by the morning sickness pill could
not be inherited by the children of victims.
Mr Freddie Astbury, chairman of the Thalidomide Action Group, said:
''These results are not surprising. We have said all along that in some
cases Thalidomide deformities can be passed on.''
Mr Astbury, a Thalidomide victim, added: ''The Department of Health
now has to launch a full public inquiry into this issue. We need the
Government to get its own scientists to look at what's going on.''
The new findings could reopen the whole issue. Experts who did not
believe Thalidomide deformities could be passed on have suggested that
those who have malformed children were probably misdiagnosed in the
first place.
For this reason, Mr Astbury believes other victims may be hiding the
fact that they have deformed children, in case it was therefore felt
they had not really been Thalidomide victims and they lost out on
compensation.
''The fear is that they may be thought to be making false claims,''
said Mr Astbury. ''We believe there could be up to 20 or 30 cases of
Thalidomide victims having deformed children in Britain.''
Dr William McBride, who first revealed the damaging effects of
Thalidomide, told a Dublin medical conference yesterday that the drug
interfered with rat genes. He and Dr Peter Huang completed their
research in Australia in July.
Delegates heard how they used a special form of radioactive-labelled
Thalidomide in tests on rat embryos. They were able to track specific
parts of Thalidomide molecules by following the radioactive labels. One
portion of the drug was found to bind to DNA, the complex molecule which
contains the genetic code, in the rat cells.
Dr McBride said: ''If it binds to the DNA, it inevitably interferes
with the genetic code. We think Thalidomide possibly does the same thing
in humans. If the cells are badly damaged, they won't reproduce, and you
will get deformities like missing limbs and eyes.
''Milder damage might cause less serious abnormalities, such as
abnormal fingers and toes. There are these children of Thalidomide
victims being born with malformations. It hasn't been possible to prove
a scientific link up to now but the statistical evidence is there.''
Mr Glenn Harrison, 35, who was born with stunted arms and legs and has
a two-year-old daughter with disabilities which mirror his own, joined
the call for an investigation.
''Surely there has got to be a public inquiry, or someone in the
medical world in this country has got to get to the bottom of this,'' he
said.
''We keep banging the drum and being ignored and at last now there is
evidence that these effects are happening. How many more children must
be born with deformities before people wake up to what is going on?''
Mr Harrison, of Crowland, Lincolnshire, received #40,000 compensation
from Thalidomide makers, Distillers, for his disabilities.
Mr Astbury said if it was now accepted that deformities could be
passed through different generations, victims could be entitled to much
more compensation.
A Department of Health spokesman said: ''We will be interested to see
the findings presented at this conference and if there is any response
to give we will give it.''
He said the Department could not respond to the call for a public
inquiry until it received a direct approach from the Thalidomide Action
Group.
Mr Neil Buckland, director of the Thalidomide Trust which looks after
the compensation fund, said he had ''no idea'' if the new findings would
lead to more money for victims.
''Our medical advisers have consistently held the belief that this
situation of Thalidomide damage cannot be passed on to second generation
individuals,'' he said.
''We have not seen Dr McBride's published data and until the
Thalidomide Trust's medical advisers have an opportunity to look at it
and for it to be subsequently considered by the trustees, I think
there's nothing that we can say.''
He said the trust held in the region of #60m and there were 457
beneficiaries.
In May, Guinness, which took over Distillers, agreed to pay a further
#2.5m per year into the trust over the next 15 years.

ENGLAND Rugby Union captain Will Carling refused to elaborate last
night on his latest visit to the Princess of Wales's home.
He went to Kensington Palace on Monday, days after his wife, Julia,
said his friendship with the Princess was over. Yesterday, he declined
to say whether the subject was likely to be aired at his home in Putney,
south-west London.
''I don't think I will be discussing with anyone what I do in the
evenings with my wife,'' said Carling.
Yesterday morning, he denied there was a rift with his TV presenter
wife. ''I am perfectly happy. There is nothing to say. There has been no
row. She is fine,'' he said.
Carling, 29, is believed to have delivered gifts of England rugby
shirts for Princes William and Harry when he called at the palace. The
Princess was not at home. It was revealed last month that the rugby
player had been a regular visitor to the royal residence and often spoke
to the Princess by telephone.

HOLLYWOOD prostitute Divine Brown, who was caught pursuing her trade
in a car with actor Hugh Grant, will go to prison for breaking her
parole in a previous case, a court decided yesterday.
Brown, 25, whose real name is Estella Marie Thompson, pled no contest
to the charge of lewd conduct in public for the incident with Grant that
led to their arrest in his parked BMW in Hollywood on July 27. She was
sentenced to 24 months' probation and fined a total of #870.
Commissioner Robert Sandoval of the Hollywood Municipal Court added 90
days to an original 90-day prison term for violating probation on a
previous conviction of soliciting in 1993.
Brown's lawyer, Mr Richard Nahigian, said she would surrender to
authorities on November 2, when she must prove that she is undertaking
an Aids education course.
Brown has turned her life around and is now doing a lot of charity
work, Mr Nahigian said.--Reuter

THE national lottery should be reformed, with prizes limited to #1m,
scratchcards abolished, and the way funds are divided reviewed, the
Liberal Democrat's national conference in Glasgow will be told.
Apart from motions on the lottery, the conference, which starts a week
on Sunday, will signal the Lib-Dems first salvo in the run-up to the
next General Election.
The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Jim Wallace, said it would be
the first time in decades any of the main parties had brought its UK
conference to Scotland.
''This is testimony to the fact that we are a federal party and
provides us with an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to Scotland
and a Scottish parliament.
''It will be the kick-off for the General Election campaign and we are
coming to Glasgow in good heart,'' he said.
Surprisingly, however, the agenda, drawn up in April, includes no
motions on Scottish home rule, but Mr Wallace said this was because of
the fast-changing nature of the issue. There would be an emergency
debate.
Other motions set down cover transport and rail privatisation, health,
and the need to restore NHS dentistry, employment, and trade.
''With the Government in disarray and Labour choosing not to put
forward policies, this conference gives the Liberal Democrats a golden
opportunity to set out positively our distinctive, independent agenda
for Britain's future.'' Mr Wallace said.
He claimed that education policy and the party's pledge to pay for
improvements with an extra 1p on income tax had won votes at the last
election.
''There is a constituency out there which respects a party which says
that if you want a decent education system, you are only going to get it
if you pay for it,'' he declared.
Mr Wallace predicted there would be an upsurge of parental unrest in
Scotland, as happened last year in England and Wales.
''You only have to look at the decreases in real terms for local
education authorities in Scotland over the next few years. There is no
way education will escape.''
On the motions to reform the lottery, Mr Menzies Campbell denied they
would earn the party a ''killjoy'' label.
''These are sensible issues which political parties ought to discuss
and issues that affect the daily lives of people more than
macro-economics,'' he said.
He claimed there was growing evidence that scratchcards were proving
addictive and most people accepted that capping the maximum payout was a
good idea.
''We have the example of the couple who won #17.5m who are now
involved in High Court litigation. I don't think it was the intention of
the lottery that the proceeds should fall into the hands of rapacious
lawyers, Scottish or English,'' Mr Campbell, a QC, said.

RAILTRACK chairman Robert Horton yesterday denied there were problems
with the West Coast main line modernisation programme which he insisted
was ''going ahead as planned'' and would be completed on schedule over
the next six years.
His chief executive, Mr John Edmonds, also denied there had been any
difficulties over maintaining the Forth Bridge, and Railtrack, which is
responsible for rail infrastructure, confirmed that Waverley station in
Edinburgh is to be re-roofed at a cost of about #20m.
Contracts for developing the revolutionary cab-based signalling system
for the London-Glasgow main line are due to be placed by the end of this
year. The #800m six-year core development programme would then proceed
''exactly as planned''.
Railtrack was ''very keen'' for the modernisation programme to proceed
and fully expected it to, in stages, over the next six years.
Asked why if the modernisation was on course the Government had put
back its privatisation proposals for the West Coast main line, Railtrack
officials said that it was for Government and its Rail Franchising
Director, not them, to decide ''the order of batting''.
Railtrack itself still expected to be privatised within the lifetime
of this Government -- that is, before March 1997 -- although Mr Horton
said he was confident that Railtrack could accommodate any privatisation
timetable the Government might impose on it.
A contract for painting the Forth Bridge would be concluded within a
few months, Mr Edmonds said, adding: ''I think you will find that all
concerned will be pleased.''
Railtrack executives were commenting after publication of Railtrack's
first annual report and accounts which showed a pre-tax profit of #189m
on a turnover of #2275m after suffering a revenue loss of #140m from
last summer's signalworkers' pay dispute.
The report also reopened the row over executives' pay by disclosing
that Mr Horton, who is contracted to work a three-day week, received
#154,000 including a #31,000 bonus, while Mr Edmonds earned #206,000, of
which #33,000 was bonus.
Labour's Transport spokesman, Mr Henry McLeish, said it was ''a major
public scandal'' that Mr Horton had received a bonus and Shadow
Transport Secretary Michael Meacher insisted that Railtrack was being
sold off way below its real value by men earning #3000 to #4000 a week''
all at the taxpayers' expense''.
Mr McLeish added that it was wrong that Railtrack's profits could be
used to make it more attractive for sale at a time when signalling,
track, and stations ''cried out for investment''.
He said: ''These so-called profits should be used to improve rail
services, not featherbed shareholders or bonuses to directors.''
Mr Jimmy Knapp, leader of the RMT rail union, and Mr Lew Adams,
general secretary of the train drivers' union, Aslef, described the
bonuses as ''obscene''.
Mr Horton responded by promising that share options would not be part
of directors' pay policy in a privatised Railtrack and said he was
''conscious of public concern about executive pay''.
Sir George Young, Transport Secretary, insisted that despite various
damaging ''leaks'' rail privatisation was still on course, while Rail
Franchise Director Roger Salmon said reports of the initial bidding were
''ill-informed''.
Sir George claimed the target of getting 51% of the rail newtork into
private hands by next April was still on, adding: ''There is an
irreversible momentum behind our policy and we are going to deliver a
privatised railway during this parliament.''
Both Sir George and Mr Salmon declared themselves confident that high
quality bids would be forthcoming.
In recent weeks, privatisation supporters have had to contend with
leaked reports questioning Railtrack's safety procedures as well as the
postponement of the West Coast sell-off.

THE new President of the Board of Trade, Mr Ian Lang, plans to use his
experience at the Scottish Office as the blueprint for seeking to extend
Scottish ''success'' to all parts of the UK.
In his first major policy speech since his appointment, Mr Lang will
tell the Scottish CBI in Glasgow tonight that in many ways Scotland
leads the UK. He will also set out his policy ''cornerstones'' for the
next few years.
Tonight's Scottish CBI dinner was indeed fortuitous, Mr Lang told The
Herald yesterday, as it presented a very good opportunity for him to
return to Scotland and reflect on his nine years at the Scottish Office
as Industry Minister and then Scottish Secretary.
It also provided a platform for him to emphasise that Scotland would
continue to feature positively in his new role and he would actively
seek to ensure successes in Scotland were applied on a wider stage.
In a wide-ranging address, Mr Lang will set out his four policy
cornerstones: the science base, innovation, international trade, and
labour market flexibility.
Scotland's leading role in attracting inward investment and helping
fuel output and exports will come in for special praise from Mr Lang,
who is also expected to warn of what he sees as the ''downside''
threatened by the EU Social Chapter and a statutory national minimum
wage.
He will emphasise that both should be avoided on the grounds that they
would put UK industry at a disadvantage.

<TEXT>
NEW car sales in the key N-registration month of August rose 3.6%, but
private sales remained disappointingly flat, it was announced yesterday.
Total new registrations last month reached 468,945, a marginal
improvement on the 452,000 figure of August 1994.
However, the improvement was almost entirely due to a 10.2% increase
in fleet sales stimulated by a change in VAT rules for leasing
companies.
The retail market, contrastingly, only grew by 0.3%, according to the
figures announced by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
The August total took the number of new cars sold in the first eight

THE saga of a pit-bull terrier kept on ''death row'' for more than
three years, looks set to drag on for another year.
In a case believed to have cost the taxpayer more than #50,000, the
dog's plight has been debated in magistrates', crown, divisional and
county courts, and been brought to the attention of the House of Lords
and Home Secretary.
Yesterday Judge Quentin Edwards dismissed what was called the
six-year-old dog's final chance in the Central London County Court.
However, its owner's legal team then launched an appeal to the Court
of Appeal and secured a gentleman's agreement with police that the dog
would not be put down for at least 28 days, while the appeal is being
lodged.
In an statement on the courtroom steps, the owner, Dianne Fanneran,
47, an optician's receptionist, of Hanwell, west London, promised that
she would do whatever it took to keep her pet alive.
In this week's two-day hearing, the court was told that the pit bull,
called Dempsey, was one of the first dogs to fall foul of the Dangerous
Dogs Act after being spotted by police unmuzzled in a public place.
The court heard that its muzzle was removed only to prevent it from
choking on its own vomit while being sick.
The animal-loving former film star, Brigitte Bardot, has offered the
dog a new home in France, and her solicitor, Mr Francois Kelidjian, was
in court yesterday.
He said: ''I think Miss Bardot will be very annoyed by today's
decision.''

EXCLUSIVE
KEY parties in the sale of ScotRail were under Scottish Office
pressure to keep to the Government's published privatisation timetable,
according to documents seen by The Herald.
However, the papers also reveal that directors of British Rail -- and
the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (Opraf) -- officially logged
their concerns about the programme scheduled.
Within three weeks, ScotRail had been publicly dropped from the second
tranche of train operators to be invited formally later this month to
tender to run services after privatisation.
The leaked minutes of the BR-Opraf directors' meeting on July 24
reveal that BR's chairman, Mr John Welsby, had ''reiterated concerns''
about ScotRail's franchise timetable and priorities.
They also show that Opraf, responsible for sales under the railways'
break-up, had ''concerns'' about a ''Scottish Office desire'' to
continue with ScotRail's privatisation process.
The disclosures last night led Labour's transport spokesman, Mr Henry
McLeish, to question why both BR and Opraf had been pressed to meet the
Government's published target date.
Mr McLeish said: ''I will be raising issues with Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth. The buck stops with him.
''He must explain the Scottish Office 'desire' to continue with the
franchising process when it was clear that Opraf in particular had
concerns about doing so.''
The minutes of the meeting, also attended by Opraf director Roger
Salmon, further reveal that: regardless of options being explored, BR is
not prepared to run Fort William-London sleeper services unless its
losses are covered, and is also unwilling to sign any deals with
privatised train operators if their networks include Passenger Transport
Executives, as with ScotRail.
The Government has insisted that its target of selling 51% of BR's
passengers services by April still stands, despite ScotRail's fall from
the September tender list. Only yesterday it was revealed that the
invitation to bid will not be extended until the spring -- and could be
off next year's schedule completely.
Mr McLeish said that he would now ask Mr Forsyth to set out the
Scottish Office case for ScotRail's privatisation -- and identify ''the
driving force behind the pressure for a sale when others are keen to
abandon the process''.
Mr McLeish said he would also ask Transport Secretary Sir George Young
to comment on national issues raised at the BR-Opraf meeting, including
BR's warning on Anglo-Scottish sleepers and its unwillingness to deal
with Passenger Transport Executives.
Since his return to the Scottish Office, Mr Forsyth has added his
weight to saving the sleepers, but has not called for an end to railway
privatisation.
ScotRail's fall in the privatisation timetable is due in part to
Strathclyde region's insistence that it retains control of services and
fares in return for a #30m-a-year subsidy via its PTE.

DAYS after the glittering premiere of Braveheart, Scotland has lost
out on the chance of another film company coming to Scotland.
A new version of Twelfth Night, produced by The Renaissance Film
Company and directed by Sir Trevor Nunn, seemed set to be filmed in the
Inveraray area.
Scottish Screen Locations had found the requested sites and agreed a
competitive price for crew accommodation. The Scottish Film Production
Fund in tandem with the Glasgow Film Fund had stitched together a
financial package worth #450,000.
Earlier this week the executives of these Scottish film agencies heard
rumours that they had lost out to Ireland, where Section 35 of the
taxation laws allow film companies considerable benefits if they locate
in the Republic, and where parts of Braveheart were filmed.
Then it appeared Sir Trevor had changed his mind again, and planned to
take the project to Cornwall if he could attract sufficient private
backing in the area.
However, a member of Renaissance said that, although the Irish
locations on offer were the least suitable of the three, the company
could still take the project there because of the generous tax breaks.
The eight-week shoot, with an 80-strong company, would not be coming
north.
Ms Celia Stevenson, director of Scottish Screen Locations, said last
night that if the determining factor proved to be the Irish tax system
''it would be really tragic''.
''We pulled out all the stops to get this one. We honestly thought we
had everything going for us. But it shows how you really can't compete
with these kind of tax laws. And they've made such a difference to the
Irish film industry that it's gone from being moribund to making over 20
films a year and is now having to build a second studio complex.''
Mr Eddie Dick, director of the Scottish Film Production Fund, was
equally despondent. ''We worked really hard to put the right package in
place. Together with the Glasgow Film Fund and private investment we
were able to offer a #450,000 incentive.
''But what we have no control over is how that money can then be used.
With a major film like Braveheart the Irish tax breaks probably only
covered the cost of relocating to Ireland. But with medium budget films
like Twelfth Night the tax system can mean major savings.
''And this is not a small movie. In terms of the Scottish economy
we're talking about several Shallow Graves.''
Last week Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth confirmed to The Herald
he would be having talks with the Treasury about the possibility of
changes to the tax structure which would let Scotland and the UK as a
whole compete on more level terms with the Irish Republic.

FRANTIC efforts behind the scenes were under way last night in an
attempt to rescue the Northern Ireland peace initiative.
Officials on both sides were in touch after the 11th-hour postponement
of the summit at which it was expected an international commission would
be announced to oversee at least a partial hand-over of IRA arms.
The Prime Minister sent a letter to his Irish counterpart, Mr John
Bruton, to try to bridge the gap between the two governments.
Mr Major was also in touch with Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick
Mayhew and with Sir Patrick's right-hand man, Mr Michael Ancram, as the
Government embarked on a damage-limitation exercise.
The letter to Mr Bruton was said to have confronted him with a series
of detailed questions about the sticking points which led to the summit
being called off, above all the decommissioning of IRA weapons and the
way in which that should be monitored.
Downing Street sources said officials were in a ''stocktaking'' phase,
with the ball firmly in Dublin's court as to where any further steps in
the peace initiative would go from here. It was impossible to say when
the summit could be rescheduled.
Sir Patrick yesterday underlined his surprise and disappointment over
the calling off, but the deputy Irish Premier, Mr Dick Spring, insisted
his government had taken the right course of action.
Both men were together on just two points: the IRA arms issue had
sabotaged the summit schedule and that a lot of work was needed to put
it back on course.
Sir Patrick called for steady nerves and stressed his determination to
get round the difficulties and restart the peace process. He told BBC
Radio: ''We are disappointed and slightly surprised, to be honest,
because only a few days ago Mr Bruton said it was reasonable to expect
we would have a summit, and from it would come an international
commission to look at the whole question of decommissioning.''
Labour leader Tony Blair, who held talks with Mr Bruton on Tuesday,
refused to blame either side, and was careful to stress that what was
needed was a political way forward.
John Cooney writes from Dublin: Mr Bruton, badly shaken after his
abrupt pull-out from the summit, studiously adopted a business-as-usual
posture in regard to the peace process.
As well as speaking to the Prime Minister by phone, Mr Bruton held
consultations at Government Buildings with Mr Spring; the British
ambassador to Ireland, Mrs Veronica Sutherland; and Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams.
Last night diplomatic sources confirmed to The Herald that agreement
had been virtually reached last Friday by officials from both
governments on a formula allowing for a parallel approach on the arms
issue and on political talks.
However, these sources also indicated that when Sinn Fein objected to
these proposals the Irish Government took fright at the prospect of a
summit accord being disowned by the Republican movement.
It prompted one respected political figure, former Justice Minister
Des O'Malley, to accuse Mr Bruton of permitting a Sinn Fein agenda to be
imposed on the peace process.
With the Ulster Unionist Party due to elect its new leader tomorrow
evening Mr Bruton's credentials to deal with him may have been damaged.
In Unionist eyes, Mr Bruton is in danger of being dismissed as the Sinn
Fein messenger boy, rather than an honest broker between Sinn Fein and
the British Government.
Concern about the talks has spread to Washington, with President Bill
Clinton planning to visit Ireland in November.
He agreed to the trip last spring, in the hope that his further
involvement in the negotiations would push the peace process forward.
He assumed that the question of decommissioning would be resolved well
in advance of his visit, and offered the services of an American
chairman of the commission which would supervise the operation.
Every effort will now be made to get Britain and Sinn Fein to agree to
a compromise. If he did not know it already, the President has now had a
lesson in the intractability of the Irish question.

THE terminal at Tahiti's international airport was set ablaze last
night with hundreds of passengers still inside as a riot erupted during
protests at France's nuclear test.
The Tahitian anti-nuclear protesters had smashed their way into the
terminal with a bulldozer.
French riot police evacuated the passengers from the smoke-filled
building and escorted them to a military base.
Riot police, backed by three armoured vehicles, had fired tear gas
after hundreds of stone-throwing and chain-swinging protesters stormed
the island's airport just outside the capital, Papeete.
Two riot policemen were injured in the clashes. An injured Tahitian
demonstrator, covered in blood, was brought out of the terminal on a
stretcher. Passengers were also evacuated from a French airliner that
had been attacked by the protesters. The plane was due to fly to Los
Angeles and Paris.
The riot was the most violent demonstration of the worldwide protests
which have erupted after France carried out a nuclear test at its South
Pacific site at Mururoa Atoll on Tuesday, the first of a planned series
of up to eight.
France, however, dismissed the tide of global protests, describing
some of the reactions as bordering on hysteria.
The government said after a cabinet meeting chaired by President
Jacques Chirac that France would stand ''absolutely firm'' against
opposition to the tests and retaliate against any diplomatic or trade
sanctions taken against it.
The underground blast, with roughly the power of the bomb dropped on
Hiroshima, provoked outrage and protesters clashed with police at
several French embassies in Europe, although Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind said it ''was a matter for the French Government''.
Hours after the test, which briefly turned the turquoise sea around
the Mururoa atoll an eerie white before the sea erupted in a wreath of
spray, atomic engineers at the site started preparing for a second
blast.
However, they could have a protest problem close at hand. Polynesian
workers at the site planned to go on strike because of the resumption of
testing. There are around 200 Polynesians working on the atoll as
technicians and mechanics.
0 Chile and New Zealand recalled their ambassadors from Paris in
protest. The US said it regretted the test and urged France to rejoin a
moratorium on testing observed by all other nuclear powers except China
since the end of the Cold War.
Russia said it deeply regretted the French test which ''dealt a
serious blow'' to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation agreements.
Japan said it regarded the French test as ''extremely regrettable''.
French wine producers and luxury goods makers say the controversy has
hit sales.
Australia called the test an ''act of contempt for the people of the
region''. ''It is an act of stupidity,'' said Australian Prime Minister
Paul Keating. New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger said he was
outraged.
Dutch police using electric saws broke through barriers placed around
the French embassy in The Hague by Greenpeace activists to cut off
access to the building.
Danish activists clambered on to the roof and chained themselves to
the entrance of the French embassy in Copenhagen.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he disagreed with Mr Chirac over the tests
and had told him so clearly on several occasions. But he told
parliament: ''German-French friendship is one of the most valuable
achievements of the post-war era. I'm not ready to join in anything that
will harm this friendship.''
In France, opposition parties including the Socialists and Communists
condemned the tests and an opinion poll showed that 59% of French voters
questioned opposed the tests.
Britain meanwhile refused to become embroiled in the international
protest.
Mr Rifkind insisted: ''It is, at the end of the day, a matter for the
French Government.'' However, he did indicate that Britain wanted the
number of tests to be strictly limited, and warned that they must not be
allowed to interfere with the eventual agreement of a worldwide test ban
treaty.
Labour described the resumption of testing as a ''flagrant breach'' of
the spirit of the existing nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The Shadow
Defence Secretary, Dr David Clark, said Britain should join the
international chorus of denunciation of what he called ''this deplorable
act''. The Liberal Democrat Defence spokesman, Mr Menzies Campbell, said
the testing was ''scientifically unnecessary and politically inept''.
In Edinburgh, anti-nuclear demonstrators demanded a boycott of all
French goods as they staged a 24-hour rooftop protest at the French
Consulate.
The vigil came as French staff at the neighbouring Institut Francais
faxed a letter of protest to President Chirac, condemning the testing as
''unjustified and unjustifiable''.
The number of demonstrators outside the consulate swelled to 100 last
night for the remaining three hours of the protest. They were joined by
Mr Tam Dalyell, MP for West Lothian. He said they were doing something
extremely important by ''telling our friends in France that their
friends have strong feelings about what has happened''.
Three protesters climbed on to the roof of the four-storey consulate
in the city's New Town on Tuesday evening as it was revealed the first
test had taken place at Mururoa.
The environmentalists, from Greenpeace, CND, Friends of the Earth, and
the Faslane Peace Camp, stuck radiation warning notices and twisted tape
around the entrance to the building. Earlier, police had used bolt
cutters to free the front door of the consulate, which had been
barricaded by protesters.
Motorists sounded horns in support as they spotted the huge protest
banners.
In London, Greenpeace and CND called for demonstrations outside the
French embassy. Greenpeace estimated 300-400 people turned up, but
Scotland Yard put the figure at 50 and said there were no arrests.
