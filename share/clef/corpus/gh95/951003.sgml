<HEADLINE>D-day for Simpson OJ jurors agree on  a verdict</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE> From PATRICK BROGAN in Washington</BYLINE>
<RECORDNO>976076920</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE jury in the OJ Simpson trial reached verdicts yesterday after less than
four hours of deliberations, but they will not be revealed until today.
Judge Lance Ito, as astonished as everybody else at the rapidity of the finding
after eight months of evidence, said the verdicts could not be announced until
the trial lawyers were gathered. The verdicts will be read at 6pm BST today.
Simpson, 48, and his attorney Carl Douglas appeared shocked by the news.
Simpson stood, biting his lip and staring at the jurors as they filed into the
courtroom.
Many of the legal teams marshalled on both sides had left Los Angeles, assuming
that the jury would take days or weeks to reach a verdict. They must now be
summoned back to hear the results.
Simpson is accused of murdering his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and an
acquaintance, Ron Goldman. They were stabbed and slashed to death in June last
year. Mr Simpson was arrested and charged with the crime a few days later.
His trial has been one of the longest and most sensational in American history,
and everyone expected the jury to take a long time to reach a verdict.
The first assumption was that the jury had held a first vote when it convened,
found that they were nearly agreed, and easily reached a conclusion immediately
afterwards.
Commentators wondered why the judge was so solicitous of the lawyers'
interests. They have done their jobs, could learn the result from television,
like everyone else, and the jury could at last go home. They have been
sequestered in a motel since the end of January.
It is possible that the jury has concluded that the evidence was so conflicting
that Simpson must be acquitted.
However that would not explain why, when it first convened yesterday, the
members of the jury asked to be read a passage of the evidence relating to the
limousine driver who came to take Mr Simpson to the airport on the night of the
murders.
He had to wait half an hour before the gate was opened and the prosecution
alleges that during that time Mr Simpson murdered his ex-wife.
The prosecution claims that when he got home, he saw the limousine and ran
round the side of the house, climbed over the fence and slipped in the door.
The driver testified that he had not noticed the car, Mr Simpson's famous white
Bronco, when he arrived.
It was found round the corner later. The driver also testified that he saw a
black man enter the house. The lights then went on and then the gate was opened
for him.
The jury listened as the driver's evidence was read back to them, and returned
to the jury room. They broke for lunch and at 2.30 Los Angeles time (10.30pm in
Britain) they suddenly reappeared with a verdict.
None of this indicates what the jury has decided. Why was the driver's
evidence, alone, worth considering, of all the 50,000 pages of evidence
presented over nine months?
Does this mean that the jury disregarded the defence team's passionate
arguments about race and the Los Angeles Police Department, and stuck to the
simplest evidence of all?
Only one thing is certain. There will not be a hung jury, or a second OJ trial.

<HEADLINE>Labour leader to lay down definite policy and costs Blair's billion pound package of promises</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE> By GEOFFREY PARKHOUSE</BYLINE>
<RECORDNO>976076921</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LABOUR leader Tony Blair will today produce costed commitments for the next
General Election, itemising, for the first time, definite pledges for a Labour
government. The costs will be more than #1bn.
He believes he can do it without extra charge on the ordinary taxpayer.
Class sizes in primary schools are to be reduced below 30, along with a package
for single parents. Medical science is to get a boost because Mr Blair believes
the race for knowledge will shape the next century.
The National Lottery is to be turned into a non-profitmaking operation, and
there is to be a massive ``windfall tax'' on the profits of privatised
utilities. His Shadow Chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown, told the Labour conference
yesterday he would use this windfall tax to abolish youth unemployment.
This alone could cost #1.4bn. Reducing class sizes will take #110m. Mr Brown
believes this can be found by scrapping the assisted places scheme for state
pupils to go to private schools.
Today Mr Blair is expected to meet the growing demand for New Labour policy and
commitments to it. His bridge for this: equipping a new Britain to meet the
challenges of the next century which he will tell the conference will require a
supreme national effort.
He will remind the Labour rank and file: ``I didn't come into politics just to
transform the party, but to transform the country.''
The cautious Shadow Chancellor confined himself to ``priorities'' for a Labour
Government: the abolition of youth unemployment, a new #75-a-week incentive to
help the long-term jobless into work, releasing local authorities' housing
capital receipts for building, modernising the welfare state. ``Over time, all
long-term unemployed will be given the chance to get back to work.''
The biggest priority is to reduce VAT on domestic fuel, bringing it down to 5%,
as low as Brussels will allow. This could cost his Treasury about #500m. But
the cutting of this unpopular Tory tax is reckoned to be a big Labour vote
winner, justifiable on moral grounds.
``In three years, the only tax cut people have seen is a Labour tax cut by
Labour defeating the Tory plans to raise fuel VAT to 17.5%,'' Mr Brown said.
In an attempt to counter any City jitters about a future Labour Government, Mr
Brown said the war against inflation would be an essential part of the battle
against insecurity and unemployment.
Older battles were invoked when Mr Blair turned on the SNP's exploitation of
the film Braveheart. At the conference's Scottish night celebrations, he said
the people of Scotland would never be taken in by the SNP. ``However you dress
it up, whatever lengths they employ, whatever attempts to take comfort from
films, you can never hide the true nature of the SNP.''
He reasserted his commitment to a Scottish Parliament: ``When we achieve that
Labour Government then we will fulfil our pledge to legislate for a Scottish
Parliament in the first year of a Labour term.''
Other commitments will be introduced today when Mr Blair will take the attack
on the Tories a step further in his keynote conference speech: there will not
be just priorities, but definite pledges. His aides claimed that after Mr Blair
sits down, these promises will be fully costed before the Tories can get at
them at their conference in Blackpool next week.
The Labour leader is destined for a standing ovation which was more than Mr
Brown received yesterday despite the fact that he declared the railways should
be run as a public service and that one of Labour's chief priorities would be
to prevent privatisation.
He warned the party: ``We will not build the new Jerusalem on a mountain of
debt. So with a Labour government there will be no stop-go, no inflationary
booms, no massaging the figures, no quick fixes, no blank cheques, no short
cuts, and no pay explosions.'' This sombre statement was in tune with the broad
mood of the party conference which has subtly shaded down its platform from
rose red to prawn pink.
Despite this, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Michael Jack, accused
Labour of advocating policies that would undermine the economy. He said 10
major public spending pledges had been made by Mr Brown, ``further proof that
the packaging may be New Labour but the policies are Old Labour''.
Mr Adair Turner, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry said
he did not believe a windfall tax on the privatised utilities was the right way
forward.
However, it was another good day for Mr Blair. He came out the winner on all
the key issues. The election for his National Executive left him with a 24-2
majority for his modernising of both party and policy.
The hot dispute of setting a minimum wage of #4.15 was kicked into touch for
another year at least, as was a motion to commit a Labour government to
renationalising all the privatised utilities. And today defiance from the
conference on the banning of left-winger Liz Davies as a parliamentary
candidate is unlikely.
But the next big step for Mr Blair will come when he begins to specify Labour
government policy at last. He will couple this with his vision for Britain and
his challenge to the country 50 years after the last World War and five years
before the millennium. He intends to kill the ambiguity of his leadership over
the last 12 months, fully confident that the broad membership of the Labour
Party support him in his modernising.

<HEADLINE>British Gas faces record complaints</HEADLINE>
<RECORDNO>976076922</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
COMPLAINTS against British Gas are at an all-time high, according to a report
by the Gas Consumers' Council released last night.
The report reveals that 30,000 people have complained about poor service and
falling standards so far this year - more than double the figure for the same
period last year.
British Gas admitted last night that ``levels of service fell in the early part
of 1995'' and apologised to customers. It blamed the problems on ``enormous
changes'' in the company required by the Government's timetable for introducing
competition to the domestic gas market from next year.
However, British Gas could risk losing the Government Charter Mark that it was
awarded for meeting performance targets under the Citizen's Charter.
The report by the Gas Consumers' Council also said that 9000 families were left
at some stage with no hot water, no gas to cook with and no central heating.
Council director Ian Powe, said on last night's Watchdog programme on BBC1 that
he would not support British Gas if it applied for a Charter Mark today.
``I'm afraid they have paid off far too many of their highly paid staff.
They're taking on temporaries who are not of the same level of training - and
there's confusion in British Gas about who is dealing with what.''
The company said last night that, when service levels fell, it brought in extra
staff and freephone helplines and that ``99.9%'' of its customers had not
complained.
British Gas's monopoly of supply to Britain's 18 million domestic gas users is
to be phased out over the next few years.
The company has been repeatedly criticised in recent months over various
controversies, including chief executive Cedric Brown's #475,000 salary and the
decision to raise the cost of service contracts.
Three million gas users have contracts and the Gas Consumers' Council has said
the rise could have serious safety implications if many people decide to go
without a regular service or rely on ``cowboys''.

THE rapid progress of Charlie Miller, Rangers' still maturing midfield player,
is to be slowed considerably to protect him from serious injury and, for the
next month at least, the Ibrox club's manager, Walter Smith, will select
carefully the matches in which the 19-year-old may play.
Smith disclosed yesterday that Miller had been feeling discomfort in his legs,
and closer examination suggests he is in danger of developing shin splints, an
affliction which can be troublesome and extremely debilitating.
Manchester United striker Andy Cole suffered badly from shin splints before the
problem was corrected, and Rangers are anxious to avoid a similar scenario with
Miller. Smith stressed that his player does not yet have the problem, but that
he is showing the early symptoms and that was the reason he didn't start last
Saturday's Old Firm match at Celtic Park.
Miller took over from Oleg Salenko 11 minutes from time, but the teenager will
not play any part at all tonight when Motherwell arrive at Ibrox for a
premier-division match which will be shown live on satellite television.
``By using him sparingly at this time we should be able to avoid a problem
which could be even longer term,'' the manager said. ``The most important thing
is to see that Charlie avoids doing any major damage.''
Smith was relieved to hear yesterday that another of his midfield players, Paul
Gascoigne, who was named in England's squad for the friendly match against
Norway in Oslo next midweek, will not have to join up with Terry Venables'
squad when they gather on Thursday.
Rangers want Gascoigne for the premier-division game against Aberdeen at
Pittodrie on Saturday, and Venables will allow the player to join the squad
after that match.
Salenko, who has been improving with each game, will have a fitness check this
morning and Stuart McCall, who has a minor injury, also will be examined, after
which Smith will finalise his team for the visit of Motherwell.
``After having won away from home on Saturday, we are back at Ibrox for the
first time since Hibs beat us,'' Smith said. ``We have to improve from that
last home match because there would be little point in winning at Celtic Park
only to lose home games.
``In the past couple of seasons Motherwell have been the most consistent of the
teams chasing us for the title, and their play has been of a good quality. We
will need a high level of performance to take the points.''
The Fir Park side struck good form on Saturday when they increased the misery
settling over Kilmarnock, and the match was a personal triumph for Tommy Coyne,
who scored two of Motherwell's goals in their 3-0 win with Eddie May netting
the other.
``After Saturday's game we can go to Ibrox with confidence and it should be a
good match because Rangers will come at us,'' said manager Alex McLeish, who
has no injury concerns. ``We took a psychological advantage from the time we
played at Ibrox towards the end of last season, when it was important for us to
win because Hibs were chasing us for a European place.''
q RANGERS striker Brian Laudrup was yesterday left out of Denmark's squad for
the European Championship Group 2 qualifier against Spain in Copenhagen on
October 11.
Doctors have ordered Laudrup to rest until he has fully recovered from an ankle
injury sustained during a training session with the Danish team in August.
Dundee midfield player Morten Wieghorst is included in the 16-man squad.

<HEADLINE>Unionist leader meets Irish Premier Trimble cools hopes of early  all-party talks</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>From JOHN COONEY in Dublin</BYLINE>
<RECORDNO>976076924</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DAVID Trimble, the Ulster Unionist Party leader yesterday dampened the Irish
Government's hopes of starting all-party talks among the political parties in
Northern Ireland before Christmas when he met Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
here.
Mr Trimble also made it clear that his party would not contemplate entry into
talks with Sinn Fein until the IRA made a move towards the destruction of its
vast arsenal of arms and explosives.
He also told Mr Bruton that he would not be forced into all-party talks against
his judgment by Prime Minister John Major as part of a package deal between
Dublin and London.
Despite these apparent setbacks to the Irish Government's somewhat optimistic
expectations of an early breakthrough in the peace process, Mr Trimble gave a
badly needed boost to the 13-months-old peace by his actual presence in Dublin.
Sources close to Mr Trimble said after his historic meeting with Mr Bruton that
both sides were pleased at the ``path-searching encounter'' and spoke
positively of new channels of communications having been opened between Irish
Nationalism and Ulster Unionism.
In a calculated change of style from the stand-off attitude adopted by his
predecessor, Mr James Molyneaux, Mr Trimble not only met Mr Bruton but also the
Opposition leaders, Mr Bertie Ahearn of Fianna Fail and Mary Harney of the
Progressive Demo-crats.
In advance of yesterday's round of talks spin-doctors on the Unionist side had
indicated that Mr Trimble would demand that the Irish Republic rejoin the
Commonwealth and realign its currency with Sterling.
On the Irish side, Government spokesmen had suggested that its aim was to have
all-party political talks under way by mid-December, the second anniversary of
the Downing Street declaration.
Dublin's timetable was driven by its desire to record progress to President
Bill Clinton when the American President visits Dublin later next month.
In the event, both Mr Bruton and Mr Trimble concentrated on explaining face to
face for the first time their immediate objectives. They also arranged a series
of contacts which will be followed up by officials in the coming weeks.
Mr Bruton told reporters that there was ``an inexorable move'' to all-party
talks but he conceded that a lot more work remained to be done.
Mr Trimble said that he would not use a phrase used last week by Mr Bruton that
all-party talks were ``tantalising close''.
However Mr Trimble stressed that, as a result of his meeting with the Irish
Premier, ``channels of communications have been established and we have
demonstrated quite clearly that we are prepared to take the Unionist case
wherever it matters''.
Mr Trimble said he wanted to ensure that there was no opportunity for
misunderstanding by the Irish Government of the Ulster Unionist position ahead
of any efforts to arrange all-party talks.
A lot of agreement was still required on the agenda and other factors before
such talks could be held, he added.
Describing the meeting as constructive, Mr Bruton said that Dublin and the
Ulster Unionists were now engaged in a line of communications which he believed
would bear fruit in the fullness of time.
Mr Trimble is expected to return to Dublin next week for talks with Mr Dick
Spring, the Irish Republic's Foreign Minister, who is currently at the United
Nations in New York.
q The United States administration is sending a business development mission to
Northern Ireland later this month, it was announced last night.
Fourteen medium-sized American firms are to take part in the visit to Ulster
and Irish border counties from October 15 to 20, the US Consulate in Belfast
said.

THE Lewis Chessmen - the world's most expensive chess set - should be retained
on the island while negotiations over their fate continue with the British
Museum, the leader of the Labour group on Western Isles Islands Council said
last night.
Speaking ahead of a meeting of the council's arts and leisure committee today -
when councillors will decide whether to request the set be given ``permanent
residence'' on the island - Councillor Callum Ian MacMillan said the
840-year-old Norse pieces might never be returned to the island if they were
given back to the British Museum at the end of a three-month loan period on
October 7.
A British Museum spokesman confirmed last night that the museum trustees were
to discuss the row next month but refused to speculate on the matter.
Mr MacMillan said ideally the Western Isles would like to keep the pieces but,
failing that, it would be prepared to compromise if they could stay in the
islands for part of the year.

GARY Armstrong has suffered more than most for club and country. There is
barely a part of his anatomy which has not been the focus for medical attention
during a decade of top-grade rugby.
Today, in the second instalment of our exclusive extracts from his
autobiography, Armstrong relives the day when a training injury on his beloved
Riverside Park threatened to end his playing career.
The Jed, Scotland, and British Lions scrum half is no stranger to the pain game
and he will carry the scars - both mental and physical - of injuries to knee,
groin, elbow, ear, thumb and ribs to the end of his days.
The catalogue of injuries would have stopped lesser men in their tracks. As he
recovers from his latest appointment with the medics - a sprung rib cartilage
sustained in the opening game of the season after a year out with catastrophic
knee damage - Armstrong writes of his burning desire to win back his Scotland
place.
He wants at least one more season at the top and is desperate to retire on his
own terms and not have his departure dictated through injury.
He knows, too, that he might not make it but is not frightened by the prospect
of failure.
q  TODAY, he writes, too, of the dark days when injury cost him his chance to
go to New Zealand with the British Lions
q  THE decision to turn his back on Scotland
q  The childhood illness which could have left him crippled
q  THE game he loves which has been the dominating force in his life.

<HEADLINE>Home rule gaining ground despite tartan tax factor</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>EXCLUSIVE By RON MacKENNA</BYLINE>
<RECORDNO>976076927</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND is swinging towards the notion of a completely independent parliament
with its own tax-raising powers, according to a System Three Poll for The
Herald.
Despite the prospect of the so-called tartan tax, almost one in three voters
(32%) are now in favour of the separatists' scenario - a 4% increase on the
last time the question was asked in January.
The results come, however, with a health warning: the poll was carried out on
the weekend of the SNP conference, and must also be set against the Braveheart
factor, the resurgence in nationalism on the back of the Hollywood film on
William Wallace.
In addition, the prospect of a Scottish Parliament with substantial powers but
within the framework of British Government still remains the most popular
option among the voting public. The figure in favour has dropped to 36% since
January, but at 1% the fall is not significant.
On being told of the results, the leaders of the Scottish Labour Party and the
Scottish National Party were both claiming comfort.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson wrote off the rise in support for
outright independence, saying the Braveheart factor had played a major role:
``Not surprisingly support for independence has increased very slightly as a
result of the free publicity received by the SNP at their conference.
``But once the spotlight is turned on the cost of the SNP's policies and on
their glaring splits, devolution will be even more popular.''
Mr Robertson added that the poll should be worrying for Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth: ``It shows that support for devolution remains solid despite
his increasingly hysterical attacks and that Scots have seen straight through
all the Tory lies about tax and a Scottish Parliament.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said both devolution and retaining the status quo had
lost ground while independence was fast gaining in popularity.
``If the poll posed the SNP's policy of independence in Europe, rather than a
wording which doesn't reflect SNP policy, then support for independence would
be higher still,'' he said.
``The SNP's independence message is capturing the positive mood of the Scottish
people and building confidence in Scotland's bright prospects as a
self-governing nation.''
Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party, said he was not
concerned by the result as the Nationalists were merely enjoying a temporary
``Braveheart blip'' in their support.
``The reality of independence is a far cry from the fiction presented by the
Nationalists and I am quite certain that the Scottish people will
overwhelmingly reject the SNP as they did at the 1992 General Election,'' he
said.
``We will continue to highlight the dangers of tearing Scotland out of the
United Kingdom whether it's through the SNP's plans for immediate independence,
or through Labour's ill-devised, tax-raising devolution scheme.''
Scottish Liberal Democrat parliamentary spokeswoman, Mrs Ray Michie, said the
poll results confirmed that Scots are not afraid of higher taxes to pay for
their own parliament.
``Michael Forsyth's tartan tax scaremongering has not had any effect on the
Scottish people,'' she said. ``They are more willing to pay for decent public
services if they have control over their own affairs.''
In the poll, voters were also

<HEADLINE>Collins deal on hold as Celtic up the price Blackburn ready to seal McKinlay move</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE> By KEN GALLACHER </BYLINE>
<RECORDNO>976076928</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TWO of Scotland's top midfielders faced different transfer opportunities last
night. Dundee United's Billy McKinlay seemed certain to join Blackburn Rovers
within the next 48 hours in a #1.6m deal. But his oft-times midfield partner in
the international side, Celtic's John Collins, may find himself priced out of
the market as the Parkhead club appear to be upping their valuation of the
player.
If the McKinlay move to Blackburn does go through, it will be a blessed relief
for the man who has served what some may see as a life sentence on one of the
now notorious long-term contracts employed by the Tannadice side. Having signed
on as a teenager, his time served is due to end this summer.
I understand that the struggling English champions have finally decided to make
their move for a player they have admired since last season.
And I believe that top-level talks between Tannadice chairman Jim McLean and
Ewood Park multi-millionaire owner Jack Walker have either taken place already,
or will take place today.
McKinlay has been unsettled on Tayside for some time, to the extent that the
length of his contract at Tannadice is already the subject of a court case
raised by the player in the Court of Session. And, if the man who scored a hat
trick in the Dundee derby at the weekend scores as successfully in the courts,
then he could become a free agent.
Even without that legal intervention, McKinlay would be able to leave Tannadice
at the end of the present season, with a transfer fee being settled by a
tribunal.
United will not want to go to these lengths for a player they must be resigned
to losing. My understanding is that the Tayside club, shrewd dealers in the
market place over the years, have a price in mind for McKinlay.
Aberdeen tried unsuccessfully to prise the player from Tannadice, but their bid
of around #1m was not enough. When that failed, the Pittodrie manager, Roy
Aitken, changed tack and bought Paul Bernard from Oldham instead.
Now, however, Blackburn, who did not splash out in the transfer market in the
summer, are ready to offer the money needed to add McKinlay's qualities to
their playing staff.
The reigning English champions have found life difficult this season as they
set out to defend their title. They have toiled in the Premiership so far,
lagging well behind several of their rivals who spent massively in the summer.
And, of course, they have slumped to successive defeats in the European
Champions' League, despite being seeded by the Continent's football hierarchy.
There has been widespread speculation about where Blackburn would eventually
spend money on the players they need to revitalise their squad. Now they have
settled on McKinlay as their first target.
If United agree to the bid - and, remember, they sold another internationalist,
Gordan Petric to Rangers for a similar sum - then McKinlay could be a Blackburn
player by the time Scotland travel to play their friendly international against
Sweden in Stockholm next week.
United manager Billy Kirkwood, trying to guide his team back to the premier
division, may not want to lose the player, but there is little doubt that to
block a deal now would simply be staving off the time when McKinlay's departure
will become inevitable.
The Blackburn deal would give the Tannadice manager money to go back into the
transfer market and perhaps allow him to afford the striker he knows his squad
requires.
Meanwhile Collins, who has told Celtic that he wants to leave the club, is in a
strange situation. He wants to go - Middlesbrough, for one, want to buy him -
but Celtic will decide the price.
Last night, the suggestions were that the English club were ready to pull out
of a proposed #3m deal after Celtic had apparently upped the ante.
The indications from Parkhead now are that they would need to see #3.5m for the
midfielder.
Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson, who has pursued Collins since the Scottish
Cup final, will not go that high. Now a stand-off which will benefit no-one
could ensue.

THE Tories yesterday launched a concerted counter-attack on the Labour
conference, with party chairman Brian Mawhinney leading the way.
A four-page ''newspaper'' entitled The Conservative Messenger is being
distributed in constituencies across the country.
In The Messenger, Dr Mawhinney says that Labour has not changed its
policies, only its rhetoric has changed. ''Over the summer I saw
examples up and down the country of the real Labour Party in local
government, letting down the people it is supposed to serve,'' he
states.
Financial Secretary to the Treasury Mr Michael Jack said of Mr Brown's
spending commitment: ''These are policies that will undermine the
British recovery. They are further proof that the packaging may be New
Labour but the policies are Old Labour.''

ALISON Daniels is rather dismissive of the views of a ''clutch of
freight and electronics companies'' which support the completion of the
M74.
The electronics industry in Scotland provides direct employment for
45,000 people and supports many more in subcontract manufacturing and
freight companies. It operates in an extremely competitive market, and
managers throughout the industry consistently tell us that customer
service -- of which delivery is a vital constituent -- is now the key
issue for them.
At present the industry exports 80% of its end product from the UK,
mainly to continental Europe, and the bulk of the remainder is sold
south of the Border. For around three-quarters of the industry's sales,
road is the preferred means of delivery.
The industry recognises the risk involved in this and has been very
active in seeking alternatives, particularly in promoting the use of the
Channel Tunnel for continental deliveries.
However, the reality is that it will be some years before such
alternatives are in a position to carry a significant part of the
traffic, and even then whatever share may be eventually captured by sea,
rail, or air there will still be a road link at the beginning or the end
of every journey.
The SPEED group regularly reviews our industry's infrastructure needs
and for a number of years we have concluded that the key problem for
road transport is getting round Glasgow, whether it is the traffic
between the West of Scotland and Mossend or the South, or traffic from
Central and Eastern Scotland to Glasgow Airport or to Prestwick.
The best solution we believe still remains the completition of the M74
to the south of Glasgow.

OIL AND GAS
THE European Investment Bank said yesterday it would lend 223m ecu
(#180m) towards the development of Texaco's Captain oil and gas field in
the UK sector of the North Sea.
The EIB will finance the construction of a floating production,
storage and off-loading (FPSO) vessel for the oilfield situated 85 miles
north-east of Aberdeen.
This vessel, which is under construction at yards in Spain and
Scotland, will produce up to 60,000 barrels per day of oil and 6.6
million cubic feet of gas when the field comes on stream in December
1996.
Texaco will lease the FPSO vessel from EIB, the investment arm of the
European Union, instead of owning it outright.
''This gives us more operational flexibility,'' a Texaco spokesman
said.
Most of the FPSO vessel is being built in northern Spain by Astilleros
del Noroeste, but the template and wellhead protector platform are being
constructed by UIE on Clydebank.
The total cost of developing the Captain field is around #500m.
It has estimated recoverable reserves of 300 million barrels of oil
and 53 billion cubic feet of gas.
The Luxembourg-based EIB is not usually a major player in offshore oil
and gas development, but it has lent 600m ecu (#480m) towards such
projects in the past.

GARY Armstrong has suffered more than most for club and country. There
is barely a part of his anatomy which has not been the focus for medical
attention during a decade of top-grade rugby.
Today, in the second instalment of our exclusive extracts from his
autobiography, Armstrong relives the day when a training injury on his
beloved Riverside Park threatened to end his playing career.
The Jed, Scotland, and British Lions scrum half is no stranger to the
pain game and he will carry the scars -- both mental and physical -- of
injuries to knee, groin, elbow, ear, thumb and ribs to the end of his
days.
The catalogue of injuries would have stopped lesser men in their
tracks. As he recovers from his latest appointment with the medics -- a
sprung rib cartilage sustained in the opening game of the season after a
year out with catastrophic knee damage -- Armstrong writes of his
burning desire to win back his Scotland place.
He wants at least one more season at the top and is desperate to
retire on his own terms and not have his departure dictated through
injury. He knows, too, that he might not make it but is not frightened
by the prospect of failure.
* TODAY, he writes, too, of the dark days when injury cost him his
chance to go to New Zealand with the British Lions
* THE decision to turn his back on Scotland
* The childhood illness which could have left him crippled
* THE game he loves which has been the dominating force in his life.

<HEADLINE>Collins deal on hold as Celtic up the price. Blackburn ready to seal McKinlay move</HEADLINE>

TWO of Scotland's top midfielders faced different transfer
opportunities last night. Dundee United's Billy McKinlay seemed certain
to join Blackburn Rovers within the next 48 hours in a #1.6m deal. But
his oft-times midfield partner in the international side, Celtic's John
Collins, may find himself priced out of the market as the Parkhead club
appear to be upping their valuation of the player.
If the McKinlay move to Blackburn does go through, it will be a
blessed relief for the man who has served what some may see as a life
sentence on one of the now notorious long-term contracts employed by the
Tannadice side. Having signed on as a teenager, his time served is due
to end this summer.
I understand that the struggling English champions have finally
decided to make their move for a player they have admired since last
season.
And I believe that top-level talks between Tannadice chairman Jim
McLean and Ewood Park multi-millionaire owner Jack Walker have either
taken place already, or will take place today.
McKinlay has been unsettled on Tayside for some time, to the etent
that the length of his contract at Tannadice is already the subject of a
court case raised by the player in the Court of Session. And, if the man
who scored a hat trick in the Dundee derby at the weekend scores as
successfully in the courts, then he could become a free agent.
Even without that legal intervention, McKinlay would be able to leave
Tannadice at the end of the present season, with a transfer fee being
settled by a tribunal.
United will not want to go to these lengths for a player they must be
resigned to losing. My understanding is that the Tayside club, shrewd
dealers in the market place over the years, have a price in mind for
McKinlay.
Aberdeen tried unsuccessfully to prise the player from Tannadice, but
their bid of around #1m was not enough. When that failed, the Pittodrie
manager, Roy Aitken, changed tack and bought Paul Bernard from Oldham
instead.
Now, however, Blackburn, who did not splash out in the transfer market
in the summer, are ready to offer the money needed to add McKinlay's
qualities to their playing staff.
The reigning English champions have found life difficult this season
as they set out to defend their title. They have toiled in the
Premiership so far, lagging well behind several of their rivals who
spent massively in the summer.
And, of course, they have slumped to successive defeats in the
European Champions' League, despite being seeded by the Continent's
football hierarchy.
There has been widespread speculation about where Blackburn would
eventually spend money on the players they need to revitalise their
squad. Now they have settled on McKinlay as their first target.
If United agree to the bid -- and, remember, they sold another
internationalist, Gordan Petric to Rangers for a similar sum -- then
McKinlay could be a Blackburn player by the time Scotland travel to play
their friendly international against Sweden in Stockholm next week.
United manager Billy Kirkwood, trying to guide his team back to the
premier division, may not want to lose the player, but there is little
doubt that to block a deal now would simply be staving off the time when
McKinlay's departure will become inevitable.
The Blackburn deal would give the Tannadice manager money to go back
into the transfer market and perhaps allow him to afford the striker he
knows his squad requires.
Meanwhile Collins, who has told Celtic that he wants to leave the
club, is in a strange situation. He wants to go -- Middlesbrough, for
one, want to buy him -- but Celtic will decide the price.
Last night, the suggestions were that the English club were ready to
pull out of a proposed #3m deal after Celtic had apparently upped the
ante.
The indications from Parkhead now are that they would need to see
#3.5m for the midfielder.
Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson, who has pursued Collins since the
Scottish Cup final, will not go that high. Now a stand-off which will
benefit no-one could ensue.

THE rapid progress of Charlie Miller, Rangers' still maturing midfield
player, is to be slowed considerably to protect him from serious injury
and, for the next month at least, the Ibrox club's manager, Walter
Smith, will select carefully the matches in which the 19-year-old may
play.
Smith disclosed yesterday that Miller had been feeling discomfort in
his legs, and closer examination suggests he is in danger of developing
shin splints, an affliction which can be troublesome and extremely
debilitating.
Manchester United striker Andy Cole suffered badly from shin splints
before the problem was corrected, and Rangers are anxious to avoid a
similar scenario with Miller. Smith stressed that his player does not
yet have the problem, but that he is showing the early symptoms and that
was the reason he didn't start last Saturday's Old Firm match at Celtic
Park.
Miller took over from Oleg Salenko 11 minutes from time, but the
teenager will not play any part at all tonight when Motherwell arrive at
Ibrox for a premier-division match which will be shown live on satellite
television.
''By using him sparingly at this time we should be able to avoid a
problem which could be even longer term,'' the manager said. ''The most
important thing is to see that Charlie avoids doing any major damage.''
Smith was relieved to hear yesterday that another of his midfield
players, Paul Gascoigne, who was named in England's squad for the
friendly match against Norway in Oslo next midweek, will not have to
join up with Terry Venables' squad when they gather on Thursday.
Rangers want Gascoigne for the premier-division game against Aberdeen
at Pittodrie on Saturday, and Venables will allow the player to join the
squad after that match.
Salenko, who has been improving with each game, will have a fitness
check this morning and Stuart McCall, who has a minor injury, also will
be examined, after which Smith will finalise his team for the visit of
Motherwell.
''After having won away from home on Saturday, we are back at Ibrox
for the first time since Hibs beat us,'' Smith said. ''We have to
improve from that last home match because there would be little point in
winning at Celtic Park only to lose home games.
''In the past couple of seasons Motherwell have been the most
consistent of the teams chasing us for the title, and their play has
been of a good quality. We will need a high level of performance to take
the points.''
The Fir Park side struck good form on Saturday when they increased the
misery settling over Kilmarnock, and the match was a personal triumph
for Tommy Coyne, who scored two of Motherwell's goals in their 3-0 win
with Eddie May netting the other.
''After Saturday's game we can go to Ibrox with confidence and it
should be a good match because Rangers will come at us,'' said manager
Alex McLeish, who has no injury concerns. ''We took a psychological
advantage from the time we played at Ibrox towards the end of last
season, when it was important for us to win because Hibs were chasing us
for a European place.''
* RANGERS striker Brian Laudrup was yesterday left out of Denmark's
squad for the European Championship Group 2 qualifier against Spain in
Copenhagen on October 11.
Doctors have ordered Laudrup to rest until he has fully recovered from
an ankle injury sustained during a training session with the Danish team
in August.
Dundee midfield player Morten Wieghorst is included in the 16-man
squad.

PERHAPS it speaks volumes about our misguided sense of priorities that
there is a topic which splits the nation's opinion and sparks heated,
sometimes even vitriolic debate, yet is not about devolution or the
state of the health service. The subject is a footballer.
Actually, the player in question happens to be the outstanding
defender in the country, and he should be one of the first listed this
afternoon in Craig Brown's Scottish squad for the match in Sweden next
week. He should be, but he won't because his name is Richard Gough.
The Scotland manager refuses to select Rangers' captain for reasons
known only to himself. Brown has consistently declined to say whether or
not he will ever recall Gough, a situation which has never been
satisfactory and which grows more intolerable because of the manner in
which Gough has been playing.
There are many people who have become weary of this debate, and the
manager sighs heavily whenever he is asked about Gough's position.
However, there are just as many people who feel the argument should not
be brushed aside, that either Brown explains why he won't pick the
player or settles whatever differences have distanced the pair and
recalls from football's equivalent of international exile a true talent.
If Brown and the others who are anti-Gough -- and many of them have
lined up in that camp for no other reason than ancient and distasteful
bigotries which so sharply divide the fans of the Old Firm -- wish,
those who want nothing more than to see the best available players
performing for Scotland to fall silent, then it is time for the manager
to speak up. His voice could ensure silence and allow him to plan for
the European Championship finals in peace.
Brown is the only one who can end the matter by giving his reasons for
Gough's exclusion, but while he continues to take the view that he is
the manager and therefore exempt from explaining his decisions or
conduct, he will be haunted by the central defender. As it stands the
country's supporters, to whom Brown has great and heavy responsibility,
deserve to be enlightened.
So far they have had to make do with speculation and rumour, and many
believe the problem stems from Gough's criticisms of the management.
Towards the end of Andy Roxburgh's reign, the Rangers player made it
clear he no longer had the confidence in Roxburgh and that he had no
wish to play for the manager, but despite what has been said by some
journalists, Gough never said he wouldn't play for Scotland.
He did suggest Brown had taken the advice from a Portuguese taxi
driver and that a game plan was affected by that information. It could
be this is why Brown will today continue his policy of passing over the
best defender in the country, and if so that is a sad reflection on two
adults who should be able to talk out the problem.
If not it is fair to ask if Brown should be allowing some past
incident to cloud his judgement because if he felt, for instance, that
Gough was the wrong type for the squad, that in some way he could be a
disruptive influence on players whose most potent strength is their team
spirit, then the manager should say so.
Brown does neither himself nor the team any good by refusing to go
public, and the supporters deserve to be told why the national side's
manager feels Gough is unsuitable when Walter Smith, manager of the most
successful club in the country, has been relying heavily on the same
player for so long.
In taking Scotland to the threshold of the European Championship
finals, Brown has done a remarkable job and his players have responded
well to his methods, but when the finals are played in England next
summer, the Scots will need to be at their best.
Colin Hendry and Colin Calderwood have been solid at the heart of the
defence, but Brown would have a difficult time convincing people either
one of them is better than Gough, and if Andy Goram is to be brought
back into play after having declined a game against Greece recently,
perhaps the same open-door policy should apply to Gough.
And please, those who had their letters published in this very
newspaper after I last wrote about Brown, needn't bother reaching for
the notepaper again. It was apparent from those letters that the writers
failed to read the column properly and obviously thought there was some
kind of vendetta between the national team's manager and myself, despite
what Brown wrote in response to the article.
There is no vendetta. This is simply about Scotland's national team
and the need to play the best players.

JURGEN Klinsmann has escaped without lasting damage from a collision
with Borussia Dortmund keeper Stefan Klos at the weekend.
The striker, now playing with Bayern Munich, was stretchered from the
pitch after having been knocked unconscious during his side's 3-1
defeat. Fears he may have fractured his skull proved unfounded after a
hospital examination.
This means that Klinsmann is likely to be available for Bayern's visit
to Scotland on October 17 for the first leg of the UEFA Cup tie against
Raith Rovers, as well as Germany's European Championship qualifiers
against Moldova and Wales over the next 10 days.

* THE number of orderings off and bookings in reserve football is
concerning many clubs, and Clyde manager Alex Smith, chairman of the
Managers and Coaches Association, is now likely to raise the issue with
the SFA.
''I know that young referees have to gain experience,'' said Smith,
''but the trend of increased bookings is worrying for clubs because they
are losing players who could not be considered for first-team football
because of what is happening in reserve matches.
''The punishment for being sent off or booked in reserve football is
the same as in a first-team game. But perhaps we could look at a sliding
scale so that the penalty points received in reserve games are not as
much.''

IPSWICH manager George Burley is set to move for Celtic's unsettled
centre-back Tony Mowbray.
The defender looks to be on the way out at Parkhead and has attracted
interest from several clubs south of the Border.
Leicester are Ipswich's main challengers for his signature, but Burley
is confident of landing the former England under-21 internationalist who
cost #1m from Middlesbrough four years ago.
Mowbray, who is rated at around #400,000, was expected to be in the
heart of the Celtic defence this season after Brian O'Neill was ruled
out for four months with a knee injury.
However, the arrival of John Hughes from Falkirk has squeezed him out
of the first team picture.

SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown will name almost 40 players today when he
lists the men who will be in Sweden next week representing their country
in games at full and 'B' international level, and Richard Gough's name
will not be there.
The Rangers captain is not in Brown's top 40, and there is no way that
the Scotland manager will relent on a decision he made when he took over
the manager's job two years ago.
He made up his mind then that he would not select Gough because the
Ibrox player had been critical of Andy Roxburgh's style of management
while Brown was his No.2.
Since that time Brown has steadfastly ignored claims made on Gough's
behalf, even now when the player is displaying some of the finest form
of his long, distinguished career.
Managers often use different yardsticks from laymen as they put
together their squads. Sir Alf Ramsey was pilloried for leaving out the
glittering goal-scoring talents of Jimmy Greaves in his England set-up
in l966 -- but Ramsey won the World Cup.
Last season, Carlos Parreira of Brazil was savaged by his nation's
press and supporters for allowing the Paris St Germain star, Rai, to sit
on the sidelines -- again Parreira won the World Cup without the
people's champion.
Jack Charlton axed Liam Brady and suffered severe criticism until his
tactical approach -- like it or not -- brought continued success to the
Republic of Ireland.
Brown must feel a kinship with these men and others who have defied
public opinion and found results proving them right.
Whatever we may think about the Brown-Gough conflict, the Scotland
manager can point to the team's defensive record in the European
Championship qualifying games and offer no further comment.
In the last eight games played, the Scotland side has lost just two
goals and both were from dubious penalty awards.
No doubt Brown, if he broke his silence on the matter, would stress
also the type of squad he has constructed. Apart from Gary McAllister,
the captain, it contains few big names, few players who would be
instantly recognised across Europe. That may be the way Brown wants it.
That type of squad always provides fewer headaches for the man in
charge, though, in the main, it provides less entertainment for the
paying public.
Of course, it's then that the manager has to decide on whether
success, no matter how limited, should come first. My belief is that
Brown has settled for that attitude now as he sees a place in the finals
within his grasp.
And so Richard Gough, winner of 61 caps for Scotland, some of these
earned as his nation's captain, will not receive a call to the colours
today, or any other day in the future, and Brown will continue to insist
that the only players he wants to talk about are those who are members
of his current squad, not those who are missing.
Today the squads he will name won't contain many surprises, just one,
in fact. Brown has plucked an unknown goalkeeper out of Northern Irish
football to promote the claims which have been made on his behalf by
that country's team manager Bryan Hamilton.
Twenty-seven-years-old Kevin McEwen, once with Motherwell but who now
plays for Crusaders, will be given the opportunity to impress Brown's
goalkeeping coach, Alan Hodgkinson, in Sweden.
Explains Brown: ''I went to watch the lad at the weekend instead of
going to the Old Firm game because Bryan Hamilton has been telling me
about him for some time. He will come with the ''B'' squad and we will
have a look at him, and Alan Hodgkinson, in particualr, will be able to
assess him.
''He was with us before, in the Under-20 team which went to Chile. He
was in that group along with Billy McKinlay and others.''
Brown will split his resources for the two games -- using the ''B''
international to have the likes of John McGinlay, Duncan Shearer, and
even long-term absentee Eoin Jess, in touch with the international
scene.
The main squad will be on normal lines but with fewer players involved
because the back-up in the event of emergency will be provided by the
second string.

Tommy Craig was snapped up during the summer to head the backroom

''When I took over it was part of my job to pick the right team off

LES Ferdinand is back and gunning for Alan Shearer's No.1 spot for the
European Championship. The Newcastle striker has been recalled by Terry
Venables for next week's trip to Norway.
And the England coach admitted he is pondering the unthinkable -- the
axe for Shearer after seven internationals without a goal.
Ferdinand, limited to just nine minutes against the USA since Venables
took over, has shaken off his injury-prone image since arriving on
Tyneside and looks just the tonic for the England attack.
''He's playing in a team that's not dissimilar in set up to the way
we've been playing, with two strikers but one much deeper,'' said
Venables.
''He likes that area in front to himself and he gives us something
different with his aerial power and pace and he's played his way in.''

RUGBY
THE Scottish Rugby Union intends to stage pool matches in the 1999
Rugby World Cup away from Murrayfield.
The tournament, centred in Wales but with Scotland, England, Ireland,
and France putting on early games, will cater for 20 nations, four more
than this summer.
SRU chief executive Bill Hogg said that although Scotland's games
would go on at Murrayfield, other pool games could be taken to Perth,
Aberdeen, and to the Borders.
The provisional plan makes the assumption that Scotland will qualify
for the event as, under the new RWC format, only hosts Wales, this
year's finalists South Africa and New Zealand, plus play-off winners
France will quality automatically.
The RWC will make an announcement today about new qualification
procedure which has already been condemned as adding unnecessary
congestion to the international schedule.
Yesterday, SRU International Board representative Fred McLeod reported
on last week's IB Council meeting which ratified the decision to sweep
away the amateurism regulations.
However, in a domestic context, the picture is still far from clear
because of the IB's decision that each Union can put in place
regulations tailored to suit individual circumstances.
* SCOTLAND will play eight games, including two Tests, during their
tour to New Zealand which starts on May 29.

Hill conceded defeat to Michael Schumacher after the recent European
Grand Prix result, but Coulthard's third place at the Nurburgring
consolidated his third place in the overall standings and he is now just
12 points behind Hill with three races to come.
The Scot, who will switch to McLaren next season, knows that, with the
pressure off and no question of team orders, he can have a go. ''Michael
only wants a few points in the three races to win the championship,''
said Coulthard. ''But it's not over until it's over.
''I was getting fed up being asked about team orders. It was obvious
all people wanted was a battle between Damon and Michael. They didn't
want a real battle between all the drivers. Hopefully that's the end of
it and we can go out and race until the finish.''
Coulthard also wants to leave the Williams team with a parting gift by
helping them secure a fourth successive constructors' crown, even though
Benetton are 20 points ahead. ''There are three weeks to go to the next
race and we will both be fired up to try and win it,'' said the Scot.
''We can win the constructors' championship. That's something I
desperately want to do, because I helped Williams win it last year and I
want to do so again before I leave.''

TWICE Formula One world champion Nigel Mansell yesterday refused to
contemplate retirement.
The English driver has been a spectator this season after his early
problems with McLaren, but he is ready to return next season.
Whether that is in Europe or America remains to be seen, but Mansell
said: ''I am going to make a decision within the next two or three weeks
whether or not to accept a full-time drive in 1996.''
Mansell, talking at the launch of his autobiography in London,
promised: ''I won't be there making the numbers up in whatever I do,
whether it's the other side of the Atlantic or in Formula One.''
He is the only man to win both titles in successive seasons -- and
even if his future is not resolved this month it will not mean the end
of the road.
''If things don't work out I'll be having a sabbatical and there might
be the possibility of me doing a certain number of guest drives although
I'm not going to make the mistake of driving for anybody just to be
there and compete. I could have done that this year. But one thing is
for sure -- I am not retiring.''
He added: ''I won't discount anything. I'm keeping my options open
which is the most sensible thing to do.''
Mansell has spent a large part of the summer overseeing affairs at
Woodbury Park, the golf course and country club in Devon in which he has
invested millions of pounds.

ROBERT Wiseman Dairies has become the biggest processor of liquid milk
in Scotland after buying its East Kilbride neighbour Mains Farm
(Hamiltons Dairies) for #7.5m.
Managing director Robert Wiseman said yesterday's acquisition put
Wiseman firmly ahead of Scottish Pride, which it previously lagged
behind.
Wiseman now controls 44% of the Scottish liquid milk market, 15% of
the UK market north of Manchester, and 5% of the overall UK market.
Scottish Pride has only 40% of the Scottish liquid milk market, but it
remains a larger company than Wiseman because of its downstream
activities in butter and cheese making.
The acquisition of Hamiltons caps a year of rapid growth for Wiseman.
It bought the liquid milk operations of the Co-operative Wholesale
Society for #6.6m in June and opened a #10m milk-processing facility in
Manchester last month.
Mr Wiseman said the company planned to sit back for a while to digest
these acquisitions and concentrate on organic growth.
Finance director Billy Keane said there were no large takeover targets
left for Wiseman in Scotland and further expansion would focus mainly on
the North of England.
Mr Wiseman said Hamiltons was a lean well-run operation which was
complimentary to Wiseman's own and there would be ''no significant job
losses'' among the 300-member workforce.
Its main processing is done in a facility in East Kilbride, only a
mile from Wiseman's headquarters, and there are distribution depots at
Stirling, Dunfermline and Dundee.
Mr Wiseman said there might be a handful of job losses at Hamiltons'
head office in East Kilbride, but he emphasised that milk processing and
distribution operations would be unaffected by the takeover.
Hamiltons, like Wiseman, was founded as a family-based firm by James
Hamilton in the forties.
Both companies specialise in selling liquid milk to retailers and
caterers and direct to the public through door-to-door deliveries.
Hamiltons made a pre-tax profit of #749,000 in the year to November
26, 1994, on turnover of #27.2m and is on track for a similar
performance during the current financial year.
Wiseman is paying #5.1m in cash and loan notes for the company, but
Hamiltons shareholders -- principally James Hamilton and his son Stuart
-- also pocket #2.4m from a special dividend paid just before the sale.
This payout has cut the company's net assets to just #100,000.
Hamiltons sold out because it lacked the ability to expand and prosper
in an increasingly difficult milk market.
The 54 million litres of milk that Hamiltons processes each year is
only a fifth of the 284 million litres that passes through Wiseman
plants.
''They had been doing well, but clearly the next step was to compete
with bigger players like ourselves,'' said Mr Keane, the Wiseman finance
director.
James Hamilton said the sale of his company to Wiseman would ensure
that it ''continues to develop as part of a larger company focused on
the UK market''.
Wiseman shares, which were floated in March 1994 at 100p, were
unchanged at 155p.
The company, of which the Wiseman family still owns 62%, made a
pre-tax profit of #7m in the year to March 31 on turnover of #108m.
Wiseman's share of the UK milk market is not yet big enough to attract
the attention of competition authorities, since it remains dwarfed by
giants like Unigate and Northern Foods.
''There are several players sitting with 15% and 20% of the UK market
place and we are only 5%,'' Mr Wiseman said.

WORLD champion Stephen Hendry beat Peter Ebdon for the second time in
eight days to reach the last eight of the Thailand Classic in Bangkok.
A 5-4 victory followed the Scot's 9-5 win in the final of the Regal
Masters at Motherwell.
But Hendry confessed: ''I didn't play well all night, while at times
Peter played out of his skin. I just kept plugging away.''
Hendry -- 3-1 down as Ebdon knocked in breaks of 140, the highest so
far, and 104 -- never hit the dizzy heights he is capable of but made
the most of the Englishman's late mistakes.
''My concentration was not as it should be, but Peter had enough
chances to win. He seemed hungrier than I was. I found it difficult to
get involved,'' added Hendry.
John Higgins, who won three ranking events last season, reeled off the
last four frames on his way to a 5-4 victory over fellow Scot Alan
McManus.
Higgins had two half-century breaks as he found his rhythm but McManus
looked set to go through as runs of 82, 72, and 61 helped him into a 4-1
lead.
Earlier, Steve Davis suffered only the second whitewash of his 17-year
professional career. The former world champion lost 5-0 to Nigel Bond.
New Zealander Dene O'Kane beat Mark Johnston-Allen 5-4, Dave Harold
was upset 5-3 by Worcester's Dave Finbow, and Malta's Tony Drago
whitewashed Malaysian amateur Yong Kien Foot 5-0. But the score
flattered Drago, who stole two frames on the black and two others on the
pink.

PEEL Hospital, an interconnected village of wooden-hutted wards which
stood in the countryside near Galashiels, was a grim place at the best
of times. It's gone now, replaced by a brand new Borders General
Hospital at Tweedbank between Melrose and Galashiels. But to a
bewildered six-year-old with an excruciating pain in his right leg, this
scattered collection of wooden huts built during World War II looked
like the end of the earth.
It was the winter of 1972. It seemed to me that at one moment I had
been a happy-go-lucky youngster, and the next I was confined to bed at
Peel Hospital, separated from the family and friends who meant so much
to me then, and who have continued to play a central role in my life
ever since.
The doctor's diagnosis had come as a tremendous shock to my dad,
Lawrence, and mum, Margaret. So far as I was concerned, I could not even
pronounce what the doctor had said was wrong with me. All I knew that it
was a big word, and it was bloody sore! I had osteomyelitis.
To this day, my dad suffers pangs of guilt whenever the word is
mentioned. I've never been much of a one to sing the praises of school
life. No doubt school suited some folk, but as a six-year-old, I looked
upon it as something which had to be tolerated but which got in the way
of the really important things in life.
Put it another way, I was forever on the lookout for reasons and
excuses which would mean that I wouldn't have to drag myself into
school.
Well, it was a Sunday and I had another ache to report. Only this time
it was true. I sat on a tree trunk, and put my case to dad. I had a
really bad pain in my ankle and I felt really rotten. As the afternoon
and evening wore on the pain didn't get any better. By now mum and dad
were convinced that I was putting on a performance of Oscar-winning
proportions.
They obviously thought that they had seen off my efforts to skip
school and thought that next morning I would be back to my cheery self.
When Monday came though, the pain was worse.
My parents were now extremely concerned that there was, indeed,
something far amiss and that on this occasion I hadn't been ''crying
wolf.'' Dad rushed me down to see our GP who declared that I wasn't at
all well, and that I should be admitted to hospital right away. I was
whipped off to Peel Hospital where the diagnosis of osteomyelitis was
confirmed. Apparently it is an inflammation of the bone marrow caused by
an infection, and in those days it was pretty serious. Maybe it still
is.
Dad went back home to Jedburgh with my clothes in a paper bag. When
Mum saw what he had under his arm, she was grief stricken.
0
Over the next eight weeks, my family and friends made the 40-mile
round trip to visit me on a daily basis. But the dark memory still
haunts me and, maybe, is responsible for the firm grip which my home
town still has on me.
I was fully cured and released from Peel Hospital on Christmas Eve,
and to this day, that's about the best Christmas present I've ever had.
My ankle has never bothered me from that day until this, and it has
taken some punishment over the years on the rugby field. In fact, in
light of the injuries which I've suffered in pursuit of the oval ball,
some might even say that it's the only part of my body which hasn't been
in the wars and put me on the sidelines.

RUGBY is in my blood, and apart from my family, friends and love of
Jed, it has been the dominating force in my life. I have never been more
happy than with a rugby ball in my hands.
We were a rugby household. From as far back as I can remember, my
father was involved with the Jed-Forest club. He was a useful enough
centre-cum-wing forward and my earliest memories are of his filthy kit
being brought back for washing, and of it drying around the house. He
has been president of the Jed club and, with my mum, brother Kevin and
wife Shona all taking a first-hand interest in the club and the game,
it's often seemed that rugby was the sole topic of conversation in the
extended Armstrong family.
In the Borders, you are not just playing for your rugby club. You are
playing for your town. If the rugby club is doing well then the town
feels good about itself.
Every Borderer is an expert on the game -- even when they aren't!
My real introduction to the game took place, as with most Border lads,
on a piece of waste ground near my house. In the Borders, rugby is the
people's game and it is played on the streets, and on any spare piece of
grass, just as football is in the cities.
We didn't play rugby in the early years in Howdenburn Primary School
in Jedburgh and so I was more or less restricted to the games on the
Middle Green near my house, and I wanted more. It was a family laundry
crisis which set me on my way to all of the fun -- mixed with not a
little heartache -- that rugby has provided me with.
Weekends revolved around rugby. On Saturdays, it would be soup and
sandwiches for lunch, and then off to Riverside to watch Jed.who were in
the Scottish second division then and so I never really got the
opportunity to watch the big international stars in operation. But Roy
Laidlaw was just starting to make a name for himself around this time,
and so even though I was just five or six, I saw him develop from
promising youngster to fully-fledged international. Of course, I had no
way of knowing it at the time, but I would eventually profit from the
vast store of knowledge that he had picked up along the way.
Sundays meant mini-rugby. Kevin and I would go down with dad and his
pals and generally just muck about as the bigger boys went through their
paces.
I was officially a couple of years too young to take part but I liked
getting mucked in the with the older lads. Eventually, they let me take
part in actual games and then I was picked to go in the side and to
travel to mini-rugby tournaments.
I was always a scrum half. I must have looked like a scrum half from
day-one and that was where I was put. I had always liked mixing it with
the bigger lads, and so the position suited me fine.
Strangely enough, though, my earliest rugby memories are not really of
playing at all. The earliest picture that comes back to me is of
''ball-boying'' at Jed Sevens. It always seemed to be that half of
Scotland had arrived at Riverside Park.
But mini-rugby was where I learned the basic skills. I would recommend
it to any parent and, for the survival and well-being of the game
itself, that must be where the future lies. The schools don't seem to be
taking much of an interest in sports these days and it has come down to
the clubs to foster and train young talent.
Everything that I know about rugby can be traced back to those Sunday
sessions at Riverside Park. Since then I've played with, and against,
the top players in the world and I've been coached by some of the
world's top men.
But mini-rugby was where I had the basics drummed into me. I watched
the game at Riverside on the Saturday and then I couldn't wait for
Sunday to arrive so that I could get the ball into my hands and have a
run about. That's where I learned to tackle, pass, kick and when to go
for the break.

EXCLUSIVE: Day two of scrum-half Gary Armstrong's story
'Over the years, I've provided more work for the medics than I care to
remember. Probably, the injuries I've picked up have been due to my
style of play, but until I started playing for Scotland in 1988, I had
not suffered any injuries to speak of.'
* IT is the moment every sportsman dreads -- the sound of a limb
cracking, followed a second later by the severe pain. GARY ARMSTRONG
knows the feeling only too well. The Scotland scrum half was given his
most serious injury in a simple training accident. Here, he explains how
it affected his career.
IT was the noise more than anything else that persuaded me this was
more than just a routine training injury. It sounded like a rifle shot,
and preceded the most excruciating pain by just a second or two.
The whole episode seemed to be taking place in slow motion. I was
running. I was passing, and, simultaneously, I was tackled. My left foot
remained anchored in the turf and the knee was twisted round to the
right.
Before I had even hit the ground, I knew it was bad; within a couple
of hours I knew it would put me on the sidelines for some time, and
within a couple of weeks, I knew it meant my international career was
hanging in the balance.
It was Thursday, August 25, 1994, three days before the annual Selkirk
seven-a-side tournament. It was a fine evening, and all seemed right
with the world.
I made a break just as I had done thousands of times. I just had Chris
Richards to beat and drew our young full-back towards me, committing him
to the tackle. I heard my brother Kevin shout for a pass. I looked over
my right shoulder to focus for the transfer, and as I did so, Chris
moved in to tackle me.
The weight of the tackle twisted me around, but with my left foot
anchored to the ground, something had to give and, unfortunately, it was
my knee. The pain was excruciating and I let out an almighty shriek as I
fell to the ground.
Everybody was crowding around. Kevin was there, and I grabbed hold of
him. In fact, I was in so much pain and gripped his shirt so tightly
that I almost ripped it off his back.
An ambulance was called and my leg was put into a splint. The pain was
so bad I almost passed out. They took me to the Borders General
Hospital, and that was the start of the longest haul of my rugby life.
With the ligaments of the knee in shreds, and needing surgery, I was
to be off for four-and-half-months and out of the game for a year.
Over the years, I've provided more work for the medics than I care to
remember. Probably, the injuries I've picked up have been due to my
style of play, but until I started playing for Scotland in 1988, I
really had not suffered any injuries to speak of.
During the Grand Slam season in 1990, I began to suffer trouble with
my left elbow. Some cartilage and flakes of bone had become dislodged
and had calcified within the joint. I had an operation and, touch wood,
I've not been troubled with the elbow since.
Which is not to say that other parts of my anatomy have not rebelled
against the treatment they have received over the years.
Just before the start of the 1992 Five Nations campaign, I was playing
for Jed against Currie at Riverside Park. I had just kicked the ball
into the air when Currie's open side flanker, Alan Elms, arrived on the
scene like an Exocet missile.
I felt my left leg go and the result was a threequarter tear in the
medial ligament. I was out of the game for three months, and missed the
entire Five Nations Championship.
I was back and raring to go for the following season, but in the
opening match of the 1993 Five Nations' tournament against Ireland at
Murrayfield, I was in the wars again. It didn't amount to much at the
time, but it would have serious and heartbreaking, consequences.
We beat the Irish 15-3, but I had suffered a groin injury. By the end
of the season, the pain was so bad that some mornings I could hardly get
out of bed.
At the same time, the race was on to get fit for the British Lions
tour to New Zealand. Despite what many journalists wrote at the time, I
was really desperate to go on that trip. The groin, though, was causing
very real problems.
Geoff Cooke from the Lions management phoned with the news that I was
out. I was absolutely gutted. That night I phoned my dad, almost in
tears, and told him the news. It came as a severe blow to my parents, as
they were booked up to go on a supporters' tour.
They continued with their trip, but it had to be cut short when, just
two weeks into the tour, my grandad died suddenly.
They came home for the funeral, and if I had been there I would have
come home, too. Fortunately, I was at home and not on the other side of
the world when I got a phone call telling me that my grandfather was
having trouble with his heart.
I was there when he died. It meant so much to me to be at his side
when he passed away. When things like that happen, it helps you to get
rugby into perspective.
Throughout that summer of 1993, I was at a very low ebb. I had missed
the Lions tour, my grandfather had died, and I was feeling pretty
dispirited.
As the summer wore on and the groin injury eventually began to clear
up, I felt I needed a fresh challenge. I was jaded and in desperate need
of the change which, they say, is as good as a rest.
As far as I was concerned the ''change'' most needed was a sabbatical
away from the scrum-half berth. I talked it over with my family, and
then wrote to the SRU telling them I needed a fresh challenge. Maybe I
was naive and maybe I had lost my way a wee bit, but at the time that
was how I felt.
A huge burden had been lifted from my shoulders. Soon, though, I came
under all sorts of pressure to get back to the scrum-half slot as Jed
were struggling.
Then I was approached by the Scottish Combined Districts selectors
with a request that I turn out for them at scrum-half against touring
Auckland.
I agreed and was almost immediately glad that I had. It went OK, and
after just 10 minutes I felt like I had never been away.
I watched Scotland surrendering 51-15 to the All Blacks at
Murrayfield. Even sitting in the stand, I really felt the pain of that
defeat. As I was leaving someone shouted from the crowd: ''It's all your
fault, Gary Armstrong.'' Maybe he was only kidding, but whoever he was,
he certainly got me thinking.
Next, the Barbarians phoned asking if I would be available for
selection -- at scrum-half -- for the side to meet the All Blacks in
Cardiff.
But the game meant I would soon be re-acquainting myself with the
medics. About 15 minutes into the second half I sprung a rib cartilage,
just as I did again a month ago when playing for Jed.
I'd just come back from the groin injury and before that I'd lost a
season with the knee, and when this happened at Cardiff, I have to admit
that, for a fleeting second or two, I began to wonder if it was all
worth it.
That was me until after Christmas. I was out for five weeks and made
my comeback for Jed against Langholm on the day that Scotland lost their
1994 Five Nations opener against Wales. In the last minute of that game
Andy Nicol damaged his ribs, and that was him out for the season.
I wasn't expecting the call but, when I had said I wanted to seek
fresh pastures, I had assured the Scottish team manager, Duncie
Paterson, that in an emergency, he could give me a ring.
Duncie had said he would respect my decision if I would agree to go
back to the scrum-half berth should the going get tough.
I agreed to give it a go against England but, for public consumption,
the team to play in the Calcutta Cup match was published with A N Other
in the No.9 slot. I had to prove my fitness in Jed's game against Gala
two weeks before the international.
On the day, I felt really good. It was a game we should have won. We
lost 15-14 when Jonathan Callard put over a disputed penalty with,
literally, the last kick of the game. That was hard to take. It was a
real sickener.
Gavin Hastings took the defeat particularly badly. He had burst into
tears during the live TV interview. We all felt for him.
I escaped with eight stitches in my left ear and finished the match
with a head bandage so big that it looked like a turban. Nevertheless, I
was glad to come away more or less in one piece and next port of call
was Lansdowne Roadin Dublin -- never my favourite international venue.
There is just something about the place that I don't like.
In any event, my misgivings about Dublin were about to be confirmed.
It wasn't much of a game. The gale that howled down the pitch put paid
to any chance of it being a classic.
We drew 6-6, so at least it wasn't a defeat. But for me the
championship was over and my international career was on hold again.
I came away from a ruck with a searing pain in my right hand. At first
it just felt like a bad stave, but the pain got worse and worse and,
even with my catalogue of medical mishaps, it was the worst pain I have
ever felt.
It was absolute murder. I went into hospital on the Monday after our
return from Ireland was operated on the next day. The surgeon reckoned
the thumb must have been bent back and twisted. The tendon was ripped
off the bone.
So that was it. I was to be out for six weeks and my international
comeback had been curtailed through injury. Over the summer, the thumb
healed to perfection and I just had the operation scar to remind me of
my Lansdowne Road misadventure.
Despite the problems with the hand, I really had recovered my appetite
for the game and I was determined to go out in a blaze of glory the
following season.
I had wanted to make sure of my Scotland place, and then to play just
one more season at the top. Fate, though, had other ideas. An innocuous
tackle in that seven-a-side practice match on my home turf put paid to
all of that.
But I am determined that fate should not have the last word. I want to
retire from the international stage on my own terms. I realise, probably
better than most, just what it will take to win back my Scotland place,
but I am determined to give it a go.
I know I have the willpower to do it. I've had more than my share of
hard knocks over the years, but I've had lots of ''guid fun'' along the
way. It's the fun aspect in front of international crowds that drives me
along.
That, and a burning desire to play my last game for Scotland at a time
and place of my own choosing. That's the target I've set myself. If I
don't make it, then at least I will have tried.
To have gone out lame, and with a whimper, would have been much harder
for me to live with. That wasn't the attitude of my Border forebears,
and it's not my attitude now.
For at least one more Five Nations' season, I want to be able to say
''Jethart's Here!''

IT is bit like the chairman of Hibs, Thistle, or Falkirk turning out
on a Saturday and scoring the winning goal, yet for Hazel Dudgeon, chief
executive of Hamilton racecourse, putting on the jockey silks and
winning races is becoming a familiar and exciting diversion from life's
administrative problems.
Twice in recent weeks the woman who has helped to transform Hamilton
into a verdant, pleasant place to lose your money has won good
amateur-rider races on Keep Your Distance, at the behest of one of the
course's greatest supporters, owner Peter Savill.
At Ayr and then Lingfield, Hazel has gently coaxed Savill's horse to
victory. ''The horse likes to feel as if he is doing nothing much,'' she
says, ''so I suppose my just sitting there suits him.''
She is feeling quite pleased with herself about other matters, too,
not least Hamilton's first Sunday meeting 10 days ago when nearly 7000
turned up on an afternoon when there was opposition from the Ryder Cup,
among other things.
There were people around who did not know how to have a bet, people
who didn't know 6 to 4 from quarter to three, children squealing on
merry-go-rounds, jazz bands, and best-dressed women contests. It was, as
some of the Glasgow vistors might have put it, a rerr terr.
The chill of the early afternoon had the short-skirted ones sheltering
in the bars, until they had to play the bagpipes. The women, on the
other hand, are much hardier. However the great Sunday racing debate
sorts itself out in the next few years, what is unstoppable is its
progress to becoming a permanent feature, winter and summer.
The experiment being carried out by the British Horseracing Board is
halfway through its first year and, while the bookmakers have been
decidedly unchuffed by the turnover to date in betting shops, everywhere
else there is optimism.
Ladbrokes took the huff and shut their shops at one point because they
are not making money from the Sunday shifts. Maybe it is a silly notion,
but are they not also there to provide a service? At any rate, racing's
rulers believe the advent of Sunday racing presents a golden opportunity
to introduce the Sport of Kings to new customers. They might well be
right.
What pleased Miss Dudgeon most was the many new faces she believes
turned out for the Sabbath experiment, which will be tried again next
year. What might have pleased her even more were the comments of British
Horseracing Board representative, Lee Richardson.
''That was the first time I had been to Hamilton and I was very
impressed.'' he said. ''It is much as I had been led to expect, an
extremely well run, friendly racecourse.''
Among the many celebs on show was former international goalie Alan
Rough but, unlike the others, he was party to good info. His tip, 'a
good thing, according to the jock,' won. Always said he was the finest
keeper we ever had.

The 20 branches, including 10 in Scotland, had sales of #23m last year

KPMG, one of Britain's biggest accountancy partnerships, is expected
to announce its decision on whether to convert into a limited liability
company today.
KPMG is thought to be considering turning its audit business into a
corporate body to safeguard partners who currently have joint and
several liability for any successful claim of negligence against their
fellow partners.
Instead, there would be corporate and individual liability where
partners' personal assets would be ring-fenced from claims against
others. The company's 570 partners have been polled on the possible
conversion.

SPECIALIST menswear retailer Moss Bros defied the gloom emanating from
the High Street with a strong financial performance in the first half.
In the six months to July 29, profits jumped by 67% to #3.2m before
tax. That compares very favourably with the #1.9m made in the same
period last year.
Sales rose by a fifth to #36.1m with underlying sales growth of 10%.
The company raised its interim dividend from 2p to 5p. As a result of
the rise in profits earnings per share surged from 7.6p to 12.63p.
Christmas trading remains the key to the group's fortunes. The company
said that although the trading environment continued to be challenging,
it remained confident the inherent strengths of the company would enable
it to prevail. Moss Bros shares jumped 7p to 570p.
Meanwhile, women's fashion group Oasis -- announcing its first results
since floating on the stock market in June -- reported an increase in
taxable profits, before flotation expenses of #1.3m, to #3.9m. Sales
rose by 26% to #24.6m, with like-for-like sales up 9.2%.
The 78 shops attract a loyal style-conscious clientele who like to
stock up on affordable versions of the latest catwalk fashions. Three
additional stores are expected to open before the year-end.
The group's balance sheet is healthy with net cash of #4m. This will
help finance overseas expansion. Its first two concessions have opened
in Germany. The first Oasis store in the Persian Gulf region is
scheduled to open in Kuwait.
Commenting on the results, chairman Michael Bennett said the board
remained confident that through further enhancement of its successful
trading formula ''we will be able to show a pleasing rate of growth''.
After a slow start to the second half, caused by the hot weather in
August, trading is said to be going well with the group increasing
market share.

* RICHARD Hughes is hoping that the disciplinarians within the Jockey
Club are in a good mood this morning.
The Irish jockey would like to end this season on a high note, but
Hughes, who rode the winner of the recent Cambridgeshire at Newmarket,
has been referred to racing's headquarters at Portman Square for misuse
of the whip at Brighton last week.
The rider used his stick 16 times as he persuaded Half An Inch into
second place in a nursery. ''I'm sure I'm going to get something like
eight days but I'm hoping it won't be too bad and that I'll be able to
ride Assessor for Richard Hannon,'' he said.
Hughes has earned plaudits in his first full season in Britain and was
again seen in favourable light when steering Cap Juluca to victory in
the Cambridgeshire.
One of the tallest Flat jockeys, Hughes is unable to ride at low
weights -- and he put up 4lb extra when steering Shikari's Son to
victory in the Stewards' Cup.

career.
He returned to his Newmarket stable none the worse by his exertions in
France, and is ready to take on the best in the world before retiring to
stud.
And Lammtarra's success certainly pleased one Irish punter who pulled
off the biggest single win paid out in that country.
He won IR#282,000 by staking IR#4000 in a double on Cambridgeshire
winner Cap Juluca (12-1) and Lammtarra (9-2).
''The backer who staked 4000 punts deserves his win,'' said a
spokesman for the losing bookmaker.
''It takes a lot of nerve to lay out that sort of cash on two of the
hardest races of the year.''

YOU have a six-inch putt and a heavy autumn shower has just started.
To save yourself a soaking you hold your umbrella in one hand and -- to
howls of foul play from your fellow-competitors -- tap in with your
putter in the other. Insistent that you are within the rules, a #1 bet
is placed. Do you collect?
Yes. Decision 14-2/2 is the proof. Rule 14-2 states: ''In making a
stroke, a player shall not accept physical assistance or protection from
the elements.'' The decision says this wording means that protection
shall not be accepted from another person. ''It does not prohibit him
from protecting himself,'' it adds.
This ruling will probably surprise most.

ROUND THE CLUBS
PAUL Stewart's round in the Captain's Putter competition at Ladybank
was the kind which most of us can only dream about. The scratch man shot
a record eight-under-par 63, which included a hole-in-one at the
166-yard fourth.
The 27-year-old papermill machinist hit a No.6-iron which landed 10
feet short of the pin and rolled in.
He was aware of the record 65 set by American Mark Brooks in Open
Championship qualifying this year, although the professional had been
playing off championship tees at the second, fourteenth, and
seventeenth, which extended the course by just over 100 yards.
Indisputably, though, Paul beat the amateur record of fellow member
Brett Williams by three shots.
''I wasn't nervous, which surprised me. Everything just seemed to go
right,'' said Stewart, a former club champion, whose handicap is now a
personal best of plus one. ''Conditions were wet and I was lucky to
finish my round before heavy rain started.''
There were no losses to par, although he required up-and-downs at the
eighth and twelfth. The birdies came at the second, fifth, ninth,
thirteenth, fifteenth, and eighteenth, plus that eagle at the fourth. In
halves of 31 and 32 he totalled just 26 putts and was nine under the
competition scratch score.
Another remarkable round recently was that of 76-year-old Bobby Reed
in the September Medal at Cambuslang. The nine handicapper shot a gross
71 over two laps of the nine-hole course to beat his age by five shots
and the CSS by six to merit a handicap reduction to eight.

<TEXT>
* This week's tip comes from GORDON NIVEN, the professional at
Bothwell Castle Golf Club.
THE most common mistake on short chips is letting the left wrist break
down at impact. Handicap golfers try to get the clubhead under the ball
-- and the result is a dreadful scoopy, flick shot.
If you tend to hit the ground behind the ball, or top it on the short
chips, then a collapsing left wrist could be the problem.
Good chipping has the clubhead leading the shot through impact, and
that can only be achieved with a firm left wrist.
In order to get the feel of the correct action, you should try the
following drill: Insert a piece of shaft into the end of an old wedge.
Set up to the ball with a slightly open stance with the extended end of
the shaft lying close to the left hip.
This set-up places the hands ahead of the ball, and in the perfect
chipping position. Now hit some shots -- because of the elongated shaft
it will be impossible for the left wrist to break down at impact.
The special device will help promote the proper feel, with the left
shoulder, arm, and wrist all working together through the shot.
Once you have got the feel of the shot, revert to hitting shots with a
normal club. And keep practising.

PARBUSTERS FINAL:
THE biggest ''bandits'' of the 1995 club golf season are ready to
receive their comeuppance in the seventh annual Herald Parbusters final
starting at 10am tomorrow at Haggs Castle with, appropriately, a shotgun
start. The sponsors again this year are Morrison Bowmore and Golf 2000.
All handicap finalists beat their marks by a breathtaking 10 or more
shots in order to qualify, and if any such performances are repeated
then pointed questions will be asked.
The term ''bandit'' has been used throughout the season with tongue
firmly in cheek because, almost without exception, the scores have
represented the performance of a lifetime.
In our six previous finals, all over the same course, the challenge
always has been to shoot a net score of level. Winning scores,
especially in the women's handicap section, have been as high as five
over.
There are a few reasons why this should be the case.
First, handicap secretaries have wielded the axe. Among the women
finalists the average handicap reduction since qualifying scores were
posted is 7.3, the most improved being Lorraine Morrow, of Ranfurly
Castle, who has dropped 12 shots from 28 to 16. The men's average
reduction is 5.1, and James Connell, of Rothesay, takes pride of place
with a fall of seven shots from 24 to 17.
The different rate of change between men and women can be explained by
the incompatible handicapping systems. The one employed by the Ladies'
Golf Union allows for a more rapid reduction, which, in the Parbusters
experience at least, has borne little relation to performance.
We are, however, dealing with the extreme end of the spectrum. At a
rough estimate, the finalists have produced the best scores out of
240,000 rounds of golf -- 190,000 for men and 50,000 for women -- which
the club returns on this page over the 16 qualifying weeks have
represented.
Peter Wilson, of the Council of National Golf Unions, who devised the
current men's system, believes such scores, statistically, are not
abnormal. In an entry of 100, he has explained, the forecast winning
score would be minus five, so much lower scoring should be expected in a
gargantuan field like ours.
This raises the second reason why scoring should not be as low as we
have come to expect. In the Parbusters final we are dealing with a
comparatively tiny number of competitors -- 10 or fewer in each class,
who, furthermore, are playing a strange course now playing long after
the rain of the past few days and under a unique format.
None, apart from the few lucky enough to start at the first, will be
playing the holes in their conventional order. The draw, moreover, has
been cooked so that no-one in any of the four principal fields will be
competing against a playing partner.
Each group of three will comprise either one woman and two men, or two
women and one man. The variation, by sleight of hand, also covers
ability, as each group simultaneously will include either one handicap
finalist and two from the scratch sections, or two from the handicappers
and one from scratch.
With the exception of the few who have played in previous finals this
will be a completely new, and for the handicappers, often an unnerving
experience.
The women's scratch field includes, not for the first time, Curtis Cup
veterans Belle Robertson and Dorothea Hastings -- who will be playing
over her home course -- plus Alyson Hendry, the three-time West of
Scotland champion, and Fiona Farquharson, the Perth and Kinross county
champion who this year won the Highland Open for a record sixth time.
Caroline Agnew and Anne Laing had to withdraw because the tournament
clashes with the women's home internationals in Wrexham.
The men's scratch field includes former Parbusters champion Euan Moir,
George Stubbs, the Perth and Kinross champion of champions, and Stewart
Miller, a boy internationalist 19 years ago -- he has since been
Dumbartonshire strokeplay and Strathclyde Police champion. A more
unusual claim to fame is that of Aaron Winston, the 1991 Israeli Amateur
champion.
Moir is the backmarker off plus 2, but handicap will play no part in
these sections, in which the winner has been consistently around the
level mark.

WORLD MATCHPLAY CHAMPIONSHIP:
SOUTH Africa's Ernie Els, the holder, will have the winners of two of
1995s four major championships as opponents-in-waiting in the #650,000
Toyota World Matchplay Championship, to be played from October 12 to 15
over the West course at Wentworth.
Ben Crenshaw, of the United States, the beaten finalist in 1981, and
Australia's Steve Elkington, respectively winners of the US Masters and
PGA titles, are among the 12-man field announced yesterday.
John Daly, the Open Champion, and Corey Pavin, his American
counterpart and the 1994 winner, are the missing links, but their
absence is more than compensated for by the first four players on the
European order of merit. Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, last year's
runner-up and loser to Elkington in a play-off for the US PGA, and Sam
Torrance, separated from his compatriot by a mere #980 with only two
counting tournaments left, are the British players involved.
The other two are Bernhard Langer, the new European open champion and
the runner-up to Severiano Ballesteros in 1984 and 1985, and Costantino
Rocca, whose three points from five games, achieved in a manner which in
musical terms deserved the description ''con brio,'' were an important
contribution to the Ryder Cup victory, in which all four played
memorable parts.
This event, with its massive first prize of #170,000, does not, of
course, come into the reckoning in deciding the contest which the two
Scots will continue unabated, despite the intervention of the matchplay
and the Dunhill Cup the following week. But Torrance could hardly be
blamed for being anxious to take the place of Ballesteros, five times
the winner but just beginning a five-month self-imposed exile from the
game; if he were a first-round loser, #30,000 would be ample
consolation.
Crenshaw apart, the interests of America will be served by Lee Janzen,
the former US Open champion and currently the Players' champion, whom
many thought -- with every subsequent justification -- should have been
selected for the US Ryder Cup team ahead of Curtis Strange, and David
Duval. The latter, a 24-year-old former Walker Cup player, is certain to
become the 1995 Rookie of the Year.
The three other players are Zimbabwe's Nick Price, almost inevitably
marking time after last year's seven victories including the Open and US
PGA championships, but still No.2 in the Sony world rankings; Vijay
Singh, of Fiji, who last year lost to Jose-Maria Olazabal in the rather
meaningless match for third place and won twice in the first five months
of this year's US Tour; and the customary representative of the
sponsor's homeland, on this occasion Japan's matchplay champion,
Katsuyoshi Timori, who, like Rocca, Janzen, and Duval, will be making
his first appearance in the event.
Besides Ballesteros, the most notable absences are those of Nick Faldo
and Ian Woosnam. Both are twice winners of the title and will not play
for the first time since 1986 -- Faldo because he is not available and
Woosnam because he has not done enough to warrant a place.

GREAT Portland Estates has strengthened its Scottish portfolio with
the #15m acquisition of two prime properties in Glasgow and Stirling.
The London-based property company paid #11m for George House, a
concrete and glass building in Glasgow's George Square that houses
offices of accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young, Royal Bank of Scotland and
other companies.
The 103,000 sq ft building was purchased from CIN, property investment
manager for British Coal Pension Fund, and generates income of nearly
#1.1m a year.
There is still 10,000 sq ft of vacant space in the 15-year-old
building, which will be upgraded prior to letting.
In a separate transaction, Great Portland Estates paid #4.4m for a
29,000 sq ft retail building next to Stirling's Thistle Centre. This
houses branches of Clydesdale Bank, TSB and McDonald's on long leases
and was purchased from Scottish Amicable.

JOHN LOGIE BAIRD AWARDS
SCOTLAND'S largest competition for innovators, the John Logie Baird
Awards, has received a timely #30,000 boost from accountancy firm Touche
Ross.
The awards, which will be hosted by Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise
Limited in the Edinburgh International Conference Centre on Thursday,
have attracted more than 250 entrants, and now boast their biggest ever
prize fund, totalling #60,000.
Ralph Adams, partner in charge for Scotland at Touche Ross, said:
''The John Logie Baird Awards have proved over the past eight years that
they are an excellent method of highlighting ideas which have true
commercial potential, and which can play an important part in
strengthening Scotland's economy.
''As a large part of our operation is devoted to assisting innovative
companies or individuals to turn their ideas into a profitable business,
it makes sense to help encourage the traditional Scots trait of
inventiveness.''
The Touche Ross contribution consists of #9000 cash and consultancy
assistance worth #21,000 to help ensure entrants for this year's awards
get the best possible chance to see their ideas come to fruition.
Douglas Martyn, chief executive of the award organiser, Scottish
Innovation, said: ''The real benefit of the John Logie Baird Awards is
that many of the previous years' winners have gone on to make successful
businesses out of their ideas.
''Indeed, one of last year's winners, Award, already employs around
200 people in Livingston, manufacturing revolutionary new contact
lenses. We have equally high hopes for some of the finalists in
Thursday's event.''
Russel Griggs, business development director of co-sponsor Scottish
Enterprise, said: ''It is encouraging to see established Scottish
companies such as Touche Ross playing their part in encouraging the
businesses of tomorrow.'' The consultancy assistance from Touche Ross
will help ensure these ideas have excellent support in their early,
formative periods.
''This sense of business community is one of the prime reasons why
Scotland's business birthrate is growing rapidly.''
The finalists for Thursday's awards include companies which have
developed:
* Innovative plastic moulded stilts for children which improve on the
safety and stability of traditional designs.
* A unique new blood test which assesses a person's risk of heart
disease or strokes.
* A gadget which does for bottled beers what the widget does for
canned beers.
* A device which attracts sea lice away from farmed salmon.

THE Guinness Peat tender offer for shares in United Auctions,
Scotland's second-largest livestock auction company, has been declared
void after attracting acceptances for just under 18,000 100p Ordinary
shares at the tender price of 275p.
On the day that United Auctions was launched on the Alternative
Investment Market, the investment company took directors by surprise
when it offered to buy 523,000 shares.
The United Auctions board advised shareholders strongly against
accepting the offer and yesterday was pleased by the support it had
received from shareholders.
In two weeks of trading leading up to last Friday's deadline for
acceptance United Auctions shares went as high as 550p and yesterday
were trading at between 445p and 470p.
Alan McGregor, United Auctions chief executive, described the level of
acceptances achieved by Guinness Peat as derisory. ''If our share price
now more correctly reflects the value of the company that is a benefit
to shareholders,'' he said.

BRITAIN'S veterinary surgeons have rejected an impassioned plea to
take a lead in improving animal welfare in transit.
It came from Colin Maclean, director-general of the Meat and Livestock
Commission, who called on delegates to the British Veterinary
Association's congress to update a key element of its animal welfare
policy.
This policy, which one of the architects admitted had been written in
the back of a taxi on a short journey to the House of Commons, urges
that farm livestock should be slaughtered as near as possible to the
place of production.
''Science clearly shows that distance is not the issue. It is the time
of the journey. This, plus the way improvements in infrastructure allow
greater distances to be travelled more quickly, show that the statement
that animals should be slaughtered as near the point of production as
possible is unsound,'' he said.
The statement made no mention of loading and unloading, which causes
animals stress, nor did it refer to other conditions of travel such as
stock intensity or the availability of bedding. This showed it to be
incomplete, he said.
It would not prevent an animal travelling 250 miles through six
markets only to be slaughtered five miles away from its starting point.
Nor did it cover short distances made by stock in unsuitable farm
transport.
Mr Maclean accused the BVA of standing in the way of calls for more
efficient and more humane forms of transport. ''It is, therefore,
counter-productive and cannot achieve your aims,'' he said.
He added that there were also important economic arguments in favour
of continuing live exports. Their cessation would lead to the immediate
loss of #185m a year in export earnings. Consequent pressure on home
markets could cost an estimated #500m or #5000 per producer.
Leading the opposition in the congress debate at Winchester,
Hampshire, Lord Carter, Labour spokesman in the Lords on Agriculture,
said any alternative to current BVA policy would have to show it
conformed to the widely accepted five basic freedoms of animals.
The Labour party was intent on bringing about a change in the Treaty
of Rome which would recognise farm animals as sentient beings and
veterinary surgeons would have to ask themselves if they supported this
view.
The party was also determined to substitute exports on the hook for
live exports, he said.
He rejected Mr Maclean's economic arguments, claiming they applied
only to part of the total food chain. When consumers were added to the
equation, he felt the economic arguments were more finely divided. In
any case, he said, the moral arguments came much higher up the scale
than economic ones.
Only a handful of delegates supported Mr Maclean's motion to amend BVA
policy, but while the majority supported the status quo, there were many
abstentions.

CONFIDENCE was high at the annual sale of Hill Cheviot rams in
Lockerbie yesterday with no less than 58 sheep selling at #1000 or more.
Setting the right note early in the sale was the consignment from Ian
Henderson, Murtholm, Langholm, which saw his 12 shearlings record no
less than seven bids in the four-figure range.
The best and joint top second price of the day was one which sold at
#6000 to Robert Paton, Castle Crawford, Biggar. Another from the same
lot sold at #3000 to Aithie Estates, Glenochar, Biggar, with yet another
selling at #2500 to Robin Hope, Winterhope, Lockerbie.
However, James Robertson, The Becks, Langholm, moved the trade on to a
higher level selling first at #6000 to James Common, Crossdykes,
Langholm, and then at #7800 jointly to Sandy Fleming, Hislop, Hawick,
and Norman Douglas, Catslackburn, Selkirk, and again at #4200 to Robert
Weir, Townfoot, Thornhill.
Overall 413 rams averaged #582.05 -- up #98.52. Auctioneers --

THERE was a cracking trade for Aberdeen-Angus females at the special
Heritage sale at Thainstone with many buyers going home empty-handed,
writes JAN GAVIN.
Prices peaked at 6000gns early on for lot three and spirited bidding
for subsequent lots underscored the widespread resurgence of interest in
the breed, especially on its home patch. Altogether 24 females sold and
averaged #2568.
As expected, the one-off quality entry, specially gathered in
celebration of Aberdeen-Angus Heritage 1995 in North-east Scotland,
attracted buyers from all over the UK and Ireland, and it is to Ireland
that the top priced animal -- the five-year-old in-calf cow Delila of
Skaill from Colin Davidson, Sandwick, Orkney -- has gone. Buyers of the
cow, interbreed champion at the recent Orkney West Mainland Show and
daughter of the 1994 Royal Highland Show female champion, were two Irish
farming couples Bill and Irene Armstrong and Jim and May Jack. They plan
to carry out embryo transfer.
Renfrewshire breeders Mr and Mrs J Stevenson, Linburn, Erskine, sold a
May 1993 heifer, Linburn Ester, for 4000gns to Neil Wattie, Alford, with
Alistair Fraser, Newton of Idvies, Forfar, paying the same price for the
March 1994 Elfleta of Eastfield from Brewis of Kelso.
North-east breeder Neil Massie got 3400gns from James Arnott, Mains of
Coull, Forfar, for one of his three Valedictorian daughters leaving
Blelack only in the special circumstances of the Heritage sale.
One of the country's oldest Aberdeen-Angus herds, the Aynho in
Brackley, Northamptonshire, also made a purchase from Robert Lane of
Shropshire at 2000gns. This heifer was seen by Aynho owner Alex McLaren
at a show during the summer.

COUNCILLOR Eleanor Howie is right (September 27). I do welcome the
SNP's decision to discuss Independence in Europe. I would have welcomed
it even more seven years ago when the slogan was adopted as a policy.
However, Eleanor Howie must not try to make a virtue out of necessity.
For the first time since 1988 the SNP was allowed to debate its policy
on the EU and delegates found that, far from being ''as clear a
blueprint as anyone could want'', it was riddled with contradictions.
However much the SNP plays with words no country can be
''independent'' in the EU but some countries will wield a great deal
more influence and power than others. The Danes recognised that when
they decided to opt out of EMU and Scots would not be as ''independent''
as the Danes if there was an SNP government because the SNP advocates a
single currency and the Scottish economy being run by a European Central
Bank outwith any Scottish democratic control.
The Norwegians and Swiss recognised that also when they both decided
to opt out altogether. Significantly we do not hear much about Norway in
SNP circles these days.
The contradictions inherent in the SNP's policy on the EU are inherent
in the EU per se, hence the widespread anger of people throughout the
member states, with politicians and political parties who have used
every device open to them to disguise the reality of what is going on.
The SNP has always been on the side of the guilty.

AT a recent business dinner the chairman of a large Scottish company
remarked to me that the lack of women in board level positions was ''a
disgrace''. With his usual candour he followed this by saying ''and that
includes our company as well''.
Why is the under-representation of women in senior management
positions such a key issue to organisations? There is a growing
acceptance that the employees of an organisation can give it a
competitive edge. Can organisations therefore afford to handicap
themselves by not exploiting the full potential of more than half the
population?
The American management guru Rosabeth Moss Kanter puts it well. While
highlighting the cost to individuals, she also argues that such myopic
policies result in organisation ''wasting a large measure of their human
talent''.
The glass ceiling which separates women from top management positions
is made of resilient materials. Straightforward discrimination is one.
Less visible, but perhaps more insidious, is the way in which the
under-representation of women in senior management can be
self-perpetuating. Assumptions by managers about the role of women can
easily become deeply embedded within organisations.
Liz Cameron (left), chief executive of Paisley and District Chamber of
Commerce, evaluates a new book which offers practical advice on how to
break through the glass ceiling.
MOST of us accept that women face a glass ceiling in management. The
evidence is all around . . . just pick up any company's annual report .
. . or look around your own organisation.
Women can look through the transparent barrier and see top management
positions but prevailing attitudes continue to present real obstacles to
advancement.
What can be done? Can the glass ceiling be broken? Better still, can
it be obliterated altogether?
Worldwide, there's no doubt that organisations are making considerable
strides in encouraging more women into senior -- if not yet
highly-visible -- jobs. Promotion structures are becoming more geared to
cater for women who want a family and a career.
Just as important as these moves within organisations are the steps
which women are themselves taking to acquire the skills they need to
climb the corporate ladder.
The last few years have seen a number of useful books aimed at career
women and into this category falls Working Out: A Woman's Guide to
Managing Career Success*.
Written by two successful business women it represents the type of
book I wish had been available when I was starting out. It would have
saved me a great deal of learning by trial and error.
In my view it would be particularly useful to women starting out in
their careers -- or perhaps re-starting after a career break. The
chapters on building support systems and assertiveness are particularly
good.
Who do you go to for advice as your career develops? Who can you
trust? Sadek and Egan suggest you ask yourself these questions to begin
to develop personal support systems, in order to identify those who
really have your interests at heart.
The authors argue that a big problem for women returning to work after
a career break is the fear of taking risks . . . ''Women are
particularly not encouraged to be the risk takers. We are supposed to be
the stable nurturing ones.''
One of the most important aspects of dealing with this is making sure
you have an emotional support system around you. Everyone needs support
from family, friends and colleagues. It allows you to do things like
make mistakes and discuss them with somebody who is not going to throw
your errors back at you.
They define assertiveness in a way I like. The key to success they
argue is knowing what you want and being assertive enough to get it.
However, being assertive does not mean being pushy or aggressive.
''Assertiveness skills,'' according to the book, ''will mark you out
as someone who can be decisive and stand their ground without
unnecessarily treading on colleagues' or bosses' toes''.
Unlike many others who write about assertiveness they rightly give
prominence to the difficulties of adopting such behaviour. In my
experience assertiveness does not come easily to many, especially to
women who are returning to work after an extended career break.
The most interesting section of the book is on networking. This has
become a buzzword in the nineties but is still a valid and important
concept.
The authors stress the importance of building relationships with
others who may be confronting the same problem and facing the same
challenges. Hear, hear, say I. I would, though, query their view that
women should concentrate particularly on networking with other women.
Research at Harvard Business School on men and women's networks
suggests a balanced approach. Women must build links with both men and
women if they wish to obtain the same resources and help that men are
able to get from other men.
My own experience backs this up -- if you want to get on, work hard at
identifying key individuals who can help you irrespective of whether
they are men or women.
Don't read the book to learn any ''secrets'' -- there aren't any. You
may even want to skip one or two chapters (for example, the one on
dressing -- the authors have a tendency to become patronising).
By the way, I have just passed my copy on to a male colleague -- on my
network! Many of the authors' points on communication skills and indeed
assertiveness are as applicable to many men I know.

SCOTTISHPOWER bought more Manweb shares on the open market yesterday,
boosting its stake in the Chester-based electricity company by a further
1% to 20.4%.
Manweb renewed its charges that ScottishPower was trying to buy it on
the cheap and urged its shareholders not to sell.
It compared ScottishPower's #1100m hostile offer unfavourably with the
latest takeover bids for Southern and Norweb.
Nevertheless, Manweb shares fell 6p to 992p, allowing ScottishPower to
buy just over one million more on the open market at its cash offer
price of 990p. ScottishPower's main cash-plus-shares offer is currently
worth 1003p, but Manweb said this compared unfavourably with North West
Water's improved offer of 1104p for Norweb and National Power's agreed
bid of 1010p for Southern.
ScottishPower brushed aside these accusations, saying that Manweb's
own earnings per share forecast was well above that of most City
analysts.
Viewed in the light of the analysts' more conservative earnings
forecasts, ScottishPower's bid for Manweb was in line with others
currently on the table in the electricity sector, it added.
''Our offer represents an excellent opportunity to exit a floundering
REC at full value,'' said ScottishPower chief executive Ian Robinson.
The closing date for acceptance of ScottishPower's offer is Friday.

THE Treasury, in its Monthly Monetary Report last week, said that
while growth in the economy had slowed, it continued at a sustainable
rate.
The Chancellor has often said this himself but he will naturally be
keeping a close eye on economic data. Certainly his decision not to lift
interest rates in the face of the Governor of the Bank of England's
urging has already been vindicated. It is the Governor who has conceded
that it no longer looks neccessary, at least in the short term.
The question now, though, is whether the next move will be down.
Certainly yesterday's Purchasing Managers' Index showing manufacturing
output at its lowest rate for nearly three years in September and an
easing in inflationary pressures increase speculation on this score.
Added to this, money supply figures from the Bank of England also
point to a slowdown in the narrow measure covering notes and coins in
circulation.
This would appear to give ammunition to the growing number, albeit
probably still a minority, of City economists who feel there is a real
danger of the recovery stalling.
However, the Chancellor will be anxious not to be precipitate. There
would be little point in jumping the gun, only to have to make a
possibly more severe corrective move later on.
Moreover, some encouragement can be taken from the reports from the
Halifax and Nationwide building societies of a slight rise in house
prices last month, helped no doubt by mortgage interest rate reductions.
But while these reductions are expected to help stabilise the
hard-pressed housing market, the building societies are still calling
for Budget measures to boost it.
Whether the Chancellor decides to ease rates slightly or yield to
cries for special measures, remains to be seen. But it is highly
unlikely that anything will happen before the Budget, if then. There are
signs, though, that export growth is slowing and no indication that
domestic demand will be strong enough to pick up the slack.

ENCOURAGING private share ownership has been one of the Government's
priorities almost from the start of its stewardship.
Privatisation was the big spur though it is doubtful whether this has
the spread of direct ownership in shares, as opposed to unit trusts and
PEPs, to the extent the Government had hoped, despite the best efforts
of organisations such as ProShare which tries to encourage share
ownership among individuals. It is not altogether certain either that
owning shares is necessarily a good thing for all.
For active private investors though there are myriad opportunities to
participate in the market and ShareLink, an inexpensive share dealing
service, is extending the boundaries with what it believes is a
revolutionary system enabling private investors to receive information
on and participate in new issues which come to the market through a
placing.
From January 1, Stock Exchange listing rules are to be changed to
allow an issuing company to bring securities to market by whatever
method it and its adviser select. There will no longer be a requirement
to make shares available directly to private investors. This has raised
concerns that it will result in their exclusion from many new issues.
ShareLink will provide private investors with information on many
forthcoming new issues by newsletter, telephone and fax services and,
for those covered by the service, an application facility. It should be
pointed out, though, that there has been an abundance of new issues over
the past two years on the back of rising share markets. A lot of them
have been flops and run into real problems. At the end of the day it is,
as always, a case of caveat emptor.

BRITISH industry can still teach Japan a thing or two. Twice every
year, engineering design consultant Ricardo Group is asked by all the
Japanese car manufacturers to audit their engines and development plans
as they try to keep ahead of the world in technology.
It is also heavily involved in motorcycle design for Taiwanese and
Japanese companies and in the build up of those industries in both China
and India. The concentration is on emissions, noise and vibration.
The immediate reaction is that through exporting technology, Ricardo
is cutting its own throat. Not so, is the argument. The Korean or
Taiwanese engineer has been trained on Ricardo systems and, as he rises
through the organisation, he will carry that dependence on its software
with him. To this end it even supplies some universities free of charge
as a long-term marketing initiative.
Increasingly, the world's largest manufacturers are having to employ
outside consultants for incremental improvements in products as eonomic
pressures continue to press on staffing levels. A completely new engine
is a rare event and the in-house designers risk being behind the
competition.
About a fifth of last year's #86m turnover came from North America,
essentially the Big Three in Detroit, one of whom is testing Ricardo's
limited slip differential for the mass car market. This promises to be a
significant royalty earner in perhaps two years time as it is cheaper
than existing designs.
Chief executive Christopher Ross is looking for niche acquisitions
such as yesterday's #3m purchase of Test Automation which supplies
engine test cells. However, Ricardo, as one of the world's two dominant
consultants, seems to under-price itself -- profits should be higher
than 1994-95's #6.16m, up 51% at the operating level, with just under
#7m in view this time round. The shares at 156p are selling at 15 times
likely earnings which still looks cheap on a medium-term view with a 5%
yield on a 6.3p dividend total. Especially since the European industry
is recovering momentum, particularly Renault's little Clio, a good
client.

NATIONAL Power confirmed yesterday that, as widely expected, it was
making a recommended offer for Southern Electric, the largest of the 12
privatised regional electricity companies (RECs) in England and Wales.
This is despite National Power chairman John Baker saying as recently
as July: ''In principle we are not interested in expanding our exposure
to the UK regulatory system.'' He added: ''I very much doubt whether the
competition authorities would allow us to.''
Still, circumstances change and the fact that other bids in the sector
have not been stopped by the Government must have persuaded National
Power to grab a slice of the action.
It is offering 825p in cash with a special dividend of 185p (net). The
offer values each Southern Electric share at 1010p compared with their
price in the market of 966p, up 69p. National Power's shares dropped
12[1/2]p to 503[1/2]p.
At 1010p, the offer represents a premium of 20.8% over the closing
price of Southern Electric's shares on September 28, the day before it
announced it was in discussions likely to lead to a recommended offer.
Commenting on the bid, Mr Baker said that combining the strengths of
National Power and Southern Electric was ''a logical development in a
rapidly developing electricity market''. He said customers would benefit
from the enlarged group's ability to supply householders when they are
free to choose their supplier in 1998.
On the sensitive issue of job cuts, Mr Baker said there were no
targets for staff reductions. The number of overlapping jobs which might
be under threat was much less than if the acquisition had been by a
rival REC.
Nevertheless, union leaders are to seek urgent talks with National
Power to discuss any job implications following the bid. Ken Jackson,
acting general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical
Union, said: ''Our fear is that this constant change of ownership in the
utilities will result in more and more job losses, which will mean a
poorer service to customers.''
To soften the anti-competitive blow, National Power has selected a
shortlist of bidders for the purchase of coal-fired plants generating
4000 megawatts of electricity. These include Applied Energy Services
(AES), Eastern Group (the regional electricity company now owned by
Hanson) and Enron.
The three power stations to be sold are in Nottinghamshire,
Shropshire, and Staffordshire, and their sale is expected to raise more
than #1000m by a combination of initial payment and further payments
related to the level of output generated.
The disposal is in line with undertakings given to the industry
regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, last year. Taken together with
the acquisition of Southern Electric, the net effect on National Power's
earnings is expected to be broadly neutral.
The terms of this latest electricity bid will comfort ScottishPower in
its attempts to acquire Manweb. In July, Mr Baker called for the
ScottishPower bid to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Investors' attention is likely to focus on the five remaining regional
electricity companies (out of an original total of 12), which have yet
to publicly disclose any bid approach.
* NORWEB said yesterday that it would recommend a revised bid from
North West Water if no higher bid emerged from rival suitor Texas Energy
Partners. Norweb is currently advising its shareholders to take no
action. Texas Energy Partners said at the time of its 1050p a share
agreed bid, that it was not final.

FORTH Ports Authority moved a step closer in its bid to acquire
Tilbury Docks in London yesterday, with unanimous approval from
shareholders to finance the deal on a rights issue.
An extraordinary meeting, held as a formality in Leith, took only a
short time to approve the motion.
Later, however, officials declined to discuss Forth Ports' stance on
also trying to take over Rosyth and Dundee -- the latter in competition
with Clydeport.
A senior official said: ''So far as Dundee is concerned, the
Department of Trade and Industry has announced that there are two
preferential bidders, ourselves and Clydeport, and it would be wrong to
comment further at this stage.''
Forth Ports, which recently announced plans for a multi-million
renovation of Leith, with ambitious moves to bring cruise liners to
Scotland's capital, moved in with a #121.6m agreed bid for Tilbury.
It announced it would raise #70.5m through a one-for-two rights issue,
with Bank of Scotland providing a further #64m in loans and overdraft
facilities.
Floated on the Stock Exchange at privatisation three years ago, Forth
Ports last year achieved pre-tax profits of #13.7m, double that of
Tilbury, and is on record as saying the acquisition would enhance
earnings by creating a wider geographical spread and giving entry to
England's main population centre.

THE skiing industry in Scotland is gearing up to lure more customers
to the pistes with major capital investment programmes at two centres on
opposite sides of the country, and a complete management restructure at
one of them.
In the east, the Cairngorm Chairlift Company has made two senior
appointments to strengthen its management team. Tim Whittome -- general
manager for the past two years -- moves up to become chief executive,
and in his place comes Anne Angus in an unusual move from store
management with Marks &amp; Spencer.
A skier, she spent 22 years with M&amp;S, latterly based at Edinburgh with
responsibility for overseeing the conversion of stores at Inverness and
Falkirk.
''We felt the kinds of demands we have up here would challenge her,''
said Mr Whittome. ''The management started off by being engineering led,
although we are very much in the leisure and recreation industry, so we
are moving towards a more customer focused approach.''
To beef up the financial side of the team, Walter Edgar has been
appointed finance director. Most recently he worked as a private
consultant and previously served with Glasgow retail and leisure group
Castle/AA Bros, which owns a chain of off licences.
On the development front, the company plans to install a funicular
railway -- the first project of its kind in Scotland -- to replace the
main chairlift system. The railway, together with changes to buildings
at the Cairngorm complex, involves a total investment of almost #17m.
Also out to attract more custom on the other side of the country at
Aonach Mor, alongside Ben Nevis, is the Nevis Range company.
Work has been going on through the summer to double the size of the
ski area, with the installation of a new chairlift to complement the
existing gondola lift.
The investment, worth almost #1m, is expected to increase usage by
about 20,000 skiers a year. It opens up skiing on the north-east side of
the mountain.

IN retrospect the omens were there at the opening of the Aviemore
Centre on December 14, 1966.
Lord Fraser, whose vision it had been, died only a month before. His
widow, Lady Fraser of Allander, unveiled the plaque and the Glasgow
Herald's report noted that following a tour she was presented with a
silver salver by the architect, who turned out to be none other than
George Poulson.
Poulson's business collapse six years later, and his trial leading to
a seven-year sentence for bribery and corruption, revealed that he had
paid out more than #500,000 in gifts during the sixties. But by 1974
there were many who would have argued that he deserved conviction on the
architectural legacy of the Aviemore Centre alone.
It was held to be a concrete atrocity despoiling natural beauty, and
its image has never recovered. Not exactly jewels among mountains, as it
was optimistically promoted.
Billy Connolly captured the popular disparagement when he described it
as ''the air raid shelter wi' windaes''. In the polite jargon of the
last two decades it has invariably been seen as a stark sixties
conception in need of ''softening''. Bluntly it is, and always was, an
incongruous mess.
Neither was it profitable. From the start it struggled. Until 1978,
when Sir Hugh Fraser completed a #445,000 buy-out of two equal partners
in the original #3m development, it had made average annual losses of
#50,000. It had made only one year of profit, in 1972-73.
''If the profit does not reach #100,000 this year, my name is not Hugh
Fraser,'' said his press spokesperson. The losses continued. Its need
for ''serious re-investment'' remained constant.
A succession of owners and one revitalisation programme after another,
some proposed, some attempted, most floundered, failed to arrest a trend
that was not anticipated in the early sixties.
If people wanted ski resorts they could afford to travel abroad. The
round trip to Aviemore from most parts of Britain became more expensive
than a Continental package. Blackpool-upon-Spey was a dated concept
almost from the day it opened.
Yet its sheer scale, and its focus as a sorely-needed source of local
employment, meant it could neither be ignored nor abandoned. Where the
entrepreneurial spirit of the sixties failed, and the business acumen of
investors from Sir Hugh Fraser to Rio Stakis had to admit defeat, the
need has been for an undisguised rescue.
On Wednesday, Highlands and Islands Enterprise will announce a
multi-million pound investment programme for tourism and industry. There
is #250m of Euro money available for the area as an Objective One
category, distinguishing it as one of the poorest in Europe.
Without such a background incentive it is difficult to see why anyone
should continue to show faith in the future of the Aviemore Centre, but
the new prospective investor Premier Land has been in talks with HIE,
which yesterday expressed interest in the company's plans to inject
capital into the facilities. It could be prepared to match any outlay.
That is about as good as the omens can be, this time around.

LONDON-based property investment company Premier Land, which expects
to finalise the purchase of Aviemore Mountain Resort today or tomorrow,
will have to spend millions of pounds upgrading the dilapidated complex.
With a proposed #17m investment by Cairngorm Chairlift Company, the
bulk of it in a funicular railway to replace the existing chairlift
serving the pistes on the east side of the Spean Valley, skiing and
tourism generally could be in for a major boost.
The two proposed multi-million-pound investments, although by separate
companies, would be complementary. Aviemore itself has only a dry ski
slope and provides accommodation and leisure facilities for skiers using
the Cairngorms, as well as for thousands of other visitors.
Highland Regional Council and the Scottish Tourist Board yesterday
welcomed the prospect of a much-needed facelift for the 100-acre
Aviemore resort, although STB emphasised that grant-funding of such an
exercise was not within its remit.
Premier Land yesterday confirmed it was in ''advanced'' acquisition
discussions with Berkley de Veer, a Sheffield-based concern owned by
entrepreneurs Glen Maud and David Newett.
The two men purchased Aviemore Mountain Resort from Glasgow-based
hotels group Stakis three years ago.
It is rumoured that Premier Land will pay about #7.5m for the resort,
which comprises four hotels, an ice rink, conference centre, theme park
and swimming pool. The purchase price will include the Douglas Hotel in
Aberdeen and the Waverley Hotel in Perth, also owned by Berkley de Veer.
Two of the Aviemore hotels, the 88-bedroom Four Seasons and 62-bedroom
Badenoch, are leased by Stakis from the resort owner. This arrangement
looks set to continue after the deal is concluded.
Premier Land chairman Desmond Bloom, who has built up a portfolio
worth #100m since he took over what was a publicly-quoted ''shell
company'' two-and-a-half years ago, said conditional contracts for the
purchase of the resort had already been exchanged.
He added: ''We do not expect anything to stop the deal from
happening.''
John Partridge, divisional planning officer for Badenoch and
Strathspey with Highland Region, would like to see some investment in
the Aviemore resort.
The council has taken discussions about previous owners' redevelopment
plans to advanced stages but the resort has then been sold on.
Mr Partridge said: ''There is hardly a facility within the Aviemore
Mountain Resort which doesn't need anything from redevelopment to
refurbishment. All the facilities are rather run down now.''
He added that the centre's swimming pool, which has been closed,
needed to be demolished and completely redeveloped, estimating the cost
at #4m. He viewed a new pool as the key issue for locals.
He added that ''another huge chunk of capital'' would be needed to
upgrade the ring road round the centre to ''adoptive standard''.
Mr Partridge said a massive amount of landscaping was required, as
well as the replacement of plant at the ice rink and extension of the
rink to enable it to double as a sports hall or exhibition centre.
Mr Bloom remained tight-lipped about his company's specific plans for
Aviemore and would not comment on speculation that Premier Land intended
to invest #16m, including public grants.
However, it is rumoured that more chalets and a four-screen cinema are
planned.
Mr Bloom said Premier Land had not yet completely formulated its
proposals but acknowledged that many millions of pounds would have to be
invested in the resort. The company plans to hire a local expert to help
it through the ''grants maze''.
Mr Bloom, a one-time boxer and former bodyguard of Screaming Lord
Sutch, is looking to create a ''major leisure resort destination'' at
Aviemore and believes investment would attract more overseas visitors.
With the resort having had something of a chequered history, he was
keen to emphasise his company's credentials. He said: ''We are a
long-term company. We are not short-term investors.''
Premier Land had sustained pre-tax losses throughout the nineties
until the 12 months to end-September last year when it made profits of
#470,000 on turnover of #6.22m.
Its shares were yesterday unchanged at 5[1/4]p.

SHARES in First Choice, Britain's third-largest tour operator, tumbled
18p to 70p wiping #28.5m off the share capital as the company forecast a
slump in annual profits to just #1m, down from #16.3m last year, and
said it was raising #44.1m through a cash-call of two shares for every
five held at 60p a share to help fund acquisitions.
The telling blow for the shares, though, is that Thomas Cook, the
largest shareholder with 21%, will not be taking up its rights. It has,
however, agreed not to sell what will be a diluted 14% holding for at
least six months. There has been speculation that Cook would like to
dispose of its stake.
First Choice -- the former Owners Abroad -- warned in July at the time
of the interims that it was facing flat markets. Yesterday's profit
projection followed the effects of the ''harsh'' summer trading
environment. On the upside, the company points to strong bookings for
1995-96, 44% ahead of the same time last year, while early demand for
next summer is also strong, with bookings up 10%.
Nor has the recent poor experience dented First Choice's ambitions.
The money being raised is to be used for the ''strategic'' acquisition
of Skibound for #23m, giving it a leading position in the UK ski market,
the ''tactical'' purchase of JWT Holidays in Ireland for #IR5.3m (#5.4m)
to give it market leadership, and the buy-in of the minority interest
the group's Canadian subsidiary Fiesta West for #8.7m.
It will also help to strengthen First Choice's damaged balance sheet
so ensuring it meets its current and future capital and regulatory
requirements.
The Irish acquisition will reduce Air 2000's potential UK
over-capacity by one Boeing 757, which will be repositioned in Dublin.
Group chief executive Francis Bacon commented: ''We have completed the
restructuring and re-branding of the group against the trading
background of the toughest UK summer season on record. Now that this has
been completed, we are looking forward to the future with confidence
encouraged by the performance of our winter 1995-96 and summer 1996
programmes.
''Furthermore, our leading position in the counter seasonal Canadian
market, together with the acquisition we have announced today, will
create a better balanced business in line with our stated strategy.''
In the meantime, the rights issue is being underwritten by Lazard
Brothers so First Choice will get its money come what may. The final
dividend of 2.45p will be payable on the new shares.

<HEADLINE>Manufacturing output slows to lowest level for three years</HEADLINE>

MANUFACTURING output expanded at its lowest rate for nearly three
years in September and inflationary pressures eased, according to the
Purchasing Managers' Index.
At the same time figures from the Bank of England pointed to a
slowdown in the rate of growth in the narrow measure of the money
supply, while both the Halifax and Nationwide building societies
reported a modest rise in house prices last month.
Overall the data added to City speculation that the next change in
interest rates would be downwards.
The Purchasing Managers' Index registered a seasonally adjusted 50.5,
compared with 52.1 in August. The September figure was the lowest since
November, 1992, just after the pound was forced to leave Europe's
exchange rate mechanism. Any reading above 50 indicates that
manufacturing grew compared with the previous month.
The slowdown in growth was due to weaker domestic and export markets
which prompted companies to supply customers from stocks rather than
increasing output. As a result capacity and price pressures were
relieved, improving the outlook for inflation.
Suppliers' delivery times shortened for the fifth month in a row, and
the prices index fell from 62.9 in August to 57.6, its lowest level
since April 1994. Five months ago the prices index peaked at 79.4.
Purchasing managers cited the recent stability of sterling and a
further easing of input shortages as the main reasons for the relaxation
of inflationary pressures. For the first time in five months the price
of newsprint did not rise.
''This is clear evidence that manufacturing activity continues to
slow, relieving pressure on suppliers and leading to the slowest rate of
growth in prices faced by purchasing managers since April 1994,'' said
Mr Peter Thomson, director-general of the Chartered Instute of
Purchasing and Supply.
Goldman Sachs's David Walton said that the index suggested that growth
in manufacturing output continued to subside, and this in turn was
leading to a sharp improvement in inflationary pressures in
manufacturing.
''The key question for the Chancellor (of the Exchequer) is whether
the slowdown is becoming more broadly based. If so he could easily
decide that a small cut in interest rates is appropriate for insurance
purposes.''
M0, which measures notes and coins in circulation and bankers'
balances, grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in September, and the
annual rate dropped back from 6.1% to 5.4%.
Notes and coins growth was also 0.5%, though its annual growth rate
eased only modestly from 5.9% to 5.7%. The six-month annualised rate,
which picked up around the middle of the year, edged down from 6.5% in
August to 6.4%.
Goldman Sachs said the pattern in notes and coin growth this year was
consistent with the recovery in retail sales after weakness in the first
quarter.
Underlying retail sales growth remained moderate with no signs of
either a renewed strengthening or a marked downturn following the weak
figures in August.
There was some cheer for the depressed housing market. The Nationwide
Building Society said house prices rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in
September, but were still 1.3% lower than the same month a year ago. The
Halifax reported an increase of 0.3%.
The building society said: ''Recent cuts in mortgage rates will help
stabilise the mnarket, and although prices seem likely to show a modest
decline over the year as a whole this would leave them little changed
from the levels prevailing since the end of 1992.''
The Nationwide is expecting some improvement in the housing market
next year, helped by tax cuts in November's Budget and the better
outlook for interest rates.
The society repeated previous calls for special help for the housing
market in the Budget, while the Halifax said that, ''Despite the small
monthly rise, the market remains weak and Government measures to
stimulate the market will be necessary to engender any significant
recovery.''

IT was June 12, 1994, and the movie executive, anticipating a sharp
start to his week, went to bed early that Sunday night. But even in Los
Angeles Mark R could never have forecast that Monday would bring such a
grotesque awakening.
His condominium on Bundy Drive was just next to that of Nicole Brown
Simpson, his bedroom close to that passageway in front of Number 875
where her throat was slashed to near-decapitation, and Ronald Goldman, a
young waiter friend, lay savagely knifed in a futile act of
self-defence. Police estimated that in each case the time of death was
around 10.15pm, yet Mark R had heard nothing.
Nothing, nothing, nothing . . . his plaintive insistence seemed
incredible, but at least the police and his friends could identify with
his distress for what was unfolding before America was a story no-one
could easily believe. A mythic happening so filled with fearsome rumour
that everyone was scared.
In a city where racism against blacks is older and deeper than any
aimed at immigrants from anywhere, a black hero was being charged with
double murder, and the only real certainty about his trial would be the
damning mirror it held up to America itself.
Immediately after the killings Mark R endured his residency on Bundy
Drive rather as a foot soldier endures the trenches. Sickened by the
cruising ghouls in the road outside he hardly left the house, and the
realisation of so much helpless blood spilled almost on his doorstep
brought with it a nightmarish insomnia. He raked his memory in search of
something, anything, which might have triggered an alarm. How could he
not have heard such violence? The guilt of it plagues him still, even
though Mark R has quit Los Angeles and now works for a film agency in
New York.
In the end it was, he thinks, the sheer wildness of speculation that
drove him out. A drug deal gone wrong; a mob hit; a second knife; O J
covering up for his grown son; a set-up by a racist cop; jealousy over a
love affair between Nicole and Goldman . . . But Goldman was gay and had
just dropped by with her lost sunglasses . . . Conspiracy theories
mounted up along with psychological reasons: martyrdom to addiction,
adultery, fame. The Othello motive. This case stretched credulity at
every turn.
But in the hades of LA, where certain cops are proven racists, and a
father beheaded his child the other day, then hurled the head on to the
freeway from an open car, who is to say the most monstrous barbarism
must be a lie?
This week the jury (nine blacks, one Latino, and two whites) are
locked in some secret location, toiling towards a verdict. Their
deliberation will be lengthy, but the racial tensions which bedevilled
the original panel have evaporated and are not expected to cloud the
outcome. However, the moment the jurors' conclusion becomes public, they
know they will be the target of someone's attack, and for that reason
the protection already given to them and their families will not be
easily withdrawn.
Yet even if it is true that in this saga the fever for publicity by
all sides has laid American justice low, at least the country is candid
about its shortcomings. Despite its faults the televising of the O J
trial has forced America into painful self-examination. Orenthal James
Simpson is the biggest American celebrity ever to have been charged with
murder and, no matter its outcome, his trial has exposed what many have
long suspected. There is a ready assumption in the States that fat money
brings absolution, that star credentials pick prison locks.
However, the country's most distinguished legal brains know now that
should this perception continue then America stands in real danger of
racial combustion.
No verdict, of course, can sit comfortably on LA's shoulders. If O J
walks free there is every chance neo-Nazi militias will torch vulnerable
districts in the city. If O J goes down the poorer Afro-Americans will
riot, believing the system has destroyed their icon, turning him into
the stereotyped black brute.
And that response, for whites as well as blacks, touches on a far
wider issue than grisly homicide, for one damning question remains: why
was a man with a known history of wife abuse still the chosen god of
most Americans? As for the rest of us, we wait and watch, scarcely
recognising that we ourselves have become the greatest part of the O J
spectacle.

NICOLA Sturgeon tells us that her speech to the SNP conference was
part of their ongoing debate on their flagship slogan, Independence in
Europe (September 27). The debate was to approve what was called a
carefully worked out policy. Her contribution, as I remember it, was to
kick the proposal into touch because it would be ridiculed by other
parties and not to declare which side the SNP should come down on
regarding the major decisions to be taken.
The truth is that the nationalists fear such a debate. So-called
independent states have never had equality of status in the European
Community and that inequality is now formalised through majority voting
in the European Union.
Nicola Sturgeon tells us that ''it will be news to Denmark'' that
there is no longer independence within the Union. On June 2, 1992, the
Danes exhibited their independence and voted against the Maastricht
Treaty. They managed to hang on to this new-found independence for 11
months until May 18, 1993, when they surrendered it once more.
Now, like every other member state, they are subservient to unelected
bankers and commissioners deciding their monetary policy. Because of
these deflationary policies, unemployment is worse than that in the
United Kingdom and they are setting about dismantling their welfare
state.
I repeat, it is the alliances of large political and economic forces
across borders that rule in Europe and it is the national organisation
of political parties which is incapable of summoning up the strength to
confront them.
That is why all truly socialist and social democratic parties in
Europe are now members of the Party of European Socialists. Just as with
the British union, if you wish to defend the interests of working people
in Scotland you have to defend them throughout that union, so it is with
the European Union.
Nationalism is an irrelevancy in this scheme. That is why their debate
collapsed.

SOMETHING must be done about that blonde man-trap still married, if

weeks the Princess of Wales has, yet again, been associated with another
woman's husband. In this instance the wife has refused to stand for it.
A marriage is over, and the finger of suspicion points starkly to
Buckingham Palace.
One needs not to spare undue sympathy for the other principals of this
little drama. Will Carling comes out of it like nothing so much as an
infatuated, immature schoolboy, vain enough to enjoy the attentions of
the Princess, and daft enough to expect his wife would stand for it.
Julia Carling is playing the whole thing for every cynical wink of
publicity; the Carling marriage, like the bond of Liz Hurley and Hugh
Grant, always had an unpleasant air of mutual career advantage to it.
But the Princess of Wales is the most dangerous and selfish of the
whole menage a trois. What is it with her and married men? And why -- if
all she seeks is a firm, Armani-clad shoulder to weep on -- are the
wives always frozen out of those just-good-friends, luncheon-pour-deux
sessions?
The cumulative result of these repeated entanglements -- Gilbey,
Hewitt, Hoare, now Carling -- is not a groundswell of sympathy for the
much-wronged, lonesome Lady Di. Rather, she makes herself more and more
ridiculous; further, the Princess begins to look every bit as
calculating and ruthless as that strange family business into which she
so eagerly married.
She is no longer a young woman, a blushing English rose of an
overwhelmed schoolgirl. The Princess of Wales is 34 years old, the
mother of a teenage son, an increasingly dab hand at manipulating press
coverage and public feeling to her own short-term advantage. She is also
surrounded by very clever people, eager to take full advantage of her
cause for their own ends. After all, her position remains strong. Her
husband is a confessed adulterer; her older child is in direct line to
the throne, her in-laws are rotten with money, and as First Wronged
Woman of the British Isles she is well placed to take them all for every
ducat they possess.
In the sixteenth-century, the mob roared for Catherine of Aragon. In
the last century, George IV's disgusting wife, Caroline of Brunswick,
was exalted even as he was pilloried. So with Charles and Diana;
whatever the rights of the case, she has always been more popular, more
pitied, and more regarded than her buttoned-up and hapless husband.
But where has it got her? The separation itself seems bizarre, if you
consider the privileged circumstances of these people. In houses like
Highgrove and Kensington Palace, it wasn't as if Charles and Diana used
the same toothpaste tube, or had to glower at each other every morning
over the kedgeree. Wealth and status do much to anaesthetise the
fortunate from shortcomings in personal relationships. Alexandra bore no
less from Edward VII -- indeed, rather more: as prince, he was
frequently cited to attend divorce courts. Jackie Kennedy put up with
untold adulteries from JFK. But these marriages survived. And the
wronged women emerged with enhanced dignity and public esteem.
What we have, in the Princess of Wales, is an astonishing and
self-destructive brand of narcissism. In cahoots with Andrew Morton, and
the other agents she employed to make known her ''true story'', she did
not hesitate to lay bare all her sufferings and woes -- though these
were of a sort calculated to inspire pity, not regard. Is it not a
strange psychology that boasts of suicide attempts, self-mutilation, and
obsessive eating disorders? In the short term, it served for the
Princess's political gain. But it also made her ridiculous; three years
on, her advantage has evaporated, and she is still ridiculous.
Then we have this astonishing cult of self-worship; a regard for the
female form like something out of H Ryder Haggard. Day after day, week
after week, Diana pummels and pounds her body to honed perfection at an
exclusive London health club. (She could install finer, and private
amenities at any of her homes; but then she would not meet nearly so
many photographers.)
Supposedly incognito, she flits through London streets in headscarf
and dark glasses, classic garb for screaming I AM VERY FAMOUS. Her
shaved and endless legs stalk from short stretchy skirts. She is
absurdly, painfully thin. She declares melodramatically that she now
quits, all together, public life: within months she is as high-profile
as ever. And, though playing the role of Wronged Woman to the hilt --
dabbing tears from the corner of an eye, posing for photographers by the
Taj Mahal -- she flirts, openly and defiantly, with prominent married
men.
What keeps this pathetic creature going is her most fashionable beauty
and a celebrity, superstar status attained by only a handful of women
this century. What is against her is time. The farce of the Wales
marriage cannot last indefinitely. There are good hopes, we gather, of
the Duke and Duchess of York being reconciled. No-one has the slightest
expectation of tearful reunion for Charles and Di. A divorce is
inevitable and, on the evidence of the past 12 months, long overdue.
Britain tires rapidly of this over-long, self-serving public
martyrdom. The Princess has, over the past three years, wrung every
conceivable drop of sympathy from the nation. She now irks us more and
more. She is a liability to her sons, now fast approaching adolescence,
and who must be enduring torment at the spectacle of their over-sexed
banshee of a mother. She is a liability to the royal family and the
throne itself, each new month stripping herself of further dignity and
discretion.
It cannot be long now before public sympathy reacts violently in
favour of her husband. His faults are manifest. His adultery is fact.
But the Prince has continued to perform, throughout the nightmarish
publicity, his full round of public duties. He is the heir to the throne
and there is no serious chance of him being forced to resign the
succession. Throughout this sensation he has maintained his dignity and
the very pointed support of the Queen and of the ruling establishment.
The Princess has destroyed herself. She has long since laid waste the
last hope of the marriage being restored. She cannot hope to maintain
her present position indefinitely. Nor will the Windsors long tolerate
such a sustained embarrassment in their midst. This woman must soon be
bought off, and repudiated, and I hope she will be.

MR Gordon Brown's idea of a windfall tax on the privatised utilities
is such a good one that it is drawing longing glances from back bench
Tories, and maybe from front bench ones as well. Whether the Chancellor
of the Exchequer is tempted to beat Mr Brown to the windfall starting
line is of considerable importance, not just because the Shadow
Chancellor would have to stand aside and grind his teeth in
understandable frustration, but because of the ends to which a Tory
Chancellor might put the windfall. The Labour Party has given details of
what it would do with the #1billion windfall levy and they appear
sensible. The only puzzle is why the figure should be as modest as #1bn.
One of the saddest sights in this country is the young people who have
no employment, indeed who may never have had employment. Jostled and
cajoled on to training schemes of variable worth, but with no better
chance in many cases of getting work at the end of them, they represent
a sorry argument for the political ethos which has dominated this
country in recent years. They are an asset and a responsibility, and at
present they are being irresponsibly wasted. Labour's plan to create an
environmental task force and to enhance opportunities in education and
work could make sense. Even more sensibly, they would be funded by the
levy on the privatised utilities.  Would this be popular? It is hard to
conceive of anything which would be more popular.
The privatised utilities represent the antithesis of much that was
good and that this country took for granted. They were sold off for a
pittance in order to satisfy ideological arrogance and they constitute
now a monopoly which makes their predecessors look like benevolent
grandparents. They are also reorganising themselves in the most random
manner possible, and for evidence we need look only at yesterday's bid
by National Power for Southern Electric. On top of this, the
disenchanted electorate has witnessed the enrichment of directors of
privatised utilities in what can be described only as a ramp. Let anyone
inclined to argue that this criticism is the politics of envy beware.
Far from it, the activities of entrepreneurs like Richard Branson, Alan
Sugar, and Anita Roddick are to be admired. They create wealth and
employment from nothing. The utilities men, one of whom said yesterday
that he felt no guilt at his #190,000 share dividend, have created
nothing other than unemployment for many. A windfall levy will not
damage these bloated giants but it may provide untold opportunities for
those who really deserve them.

DEPT of Amazing Things the BBC Does with Our Licence Fees: news chiefs
at BBC Scotland were, like every other journalist in Scotland, in
pursuit of Brian MacKinnon/ Brandon Lee the 32-year-old Bearsden
schoolboy.
Despite the fact they have many talented investigative reporters and
researchers on their payroll, the BBC decided to hire the services of
the Pinkerton detective agency in an attempt to find out the whereabouts
of Scotland's most famous pupil. Being a very structured kind of
organisation, the BBC news chiefs handed over to the Pinkerton men a
copy of a document called Guidelines for Factual Programmes, a John
Birtian document running to some 80 sections which sets out a strict set
of rules which must be obeyed when in search of the facts.
The guidelines are variously referred to by BBC journos as a
journalistic condom or a chastity belt. We have not seen the guidelines
but it would presumably prohibit any Philip Marlowe in the BBC's employ
from pistol-whipping a suspect into giving information.
Acting within the guidelines, the Pinkerton men were able to tell
their BBC client only that Mr MacKinnon had not used credit cards of
late.
Kept waiting
FOLLOWING Railtrack's disastrous attempts to produce a timetable,
ScotRail announcers are being equally non-committal. Passengers awaiting
an Aberdeen train at Haymarket at the weekend were told only that it
might arrive ''in the near future''.
Last orders
WE had hoped to draw a veil on the subject of pub quizzes but Harry
Sheridan of East Kilbride wishes to pass on the tale of the
question-master who was fed up with the smart-ass team who won the
competition in their pub week in and week out. (There is always a bunch
of clever clogs like, for example, the Academics at the Doublet Bar in
Park Road, Glasgow.)
The quizmaster tried to spike the guns of the team in question by
asking: ''Who was the foreman when the Pyramids were being built?'' It
was in vain. The captain of the smart alecs asked: ''Do you mean the day
shift or the night shift?''
Take it as read
THE Scottish author A L Kennedy is in mystical form with her
introduction to the catalogue for the Scottish Book Fortnight which
begins later this month.
She writes: ''It's a list, a recommendation, a convenient
pre-selection of those things which are undeniably both Scottish and
books. But what is it like? If you were locked in the Caledonian dark,
just you and the Scottish Fortnight called Books, what would it be like?
''Would you reach and feel the cold, dark buttons of a Calvinist --
firmly fastened -- or the odd damp of a seal's pelt, anxious skin, a
mouth with too many teeth? The mouth would be mainly safe, devoting
itself to all the languages of Scotland, laughing in them, shouting in
them, blessing and blaspheming in them and liking them just for badness
because they are the way they want to be. So you'd hear the Fortnight
coming, singing and seducing and mortifying like a very good very bad
party on its way.
''Then given half a gill of a chance, the Fortnight would delight your
children, embarrass your friends, offer you mind-altering histories,
shake your hand, pick your pocket, tickle your neck and tell you stories
in and out and through all your veins.
''The Fortnight wants to tell you things. It wants to slip in behind
your eyes and get really acquainted and when it does -- the way it likes
to and the way you'll like it, too -- you'll see the landscape where the
Fortnight grew. You'll walk through plantations of individual energy and
will, even outcrops of hope. Here and there, you'll dip your boots in a
babbling publisher, or catch a brace of editors breaking cover. And on
every imaginable and unimaginable side you'll see more and more
different writers than you could ever shake a stick at. Not that you
should shake a stick at writers -- the Fortnight would disapprove.''
Go on. Open a book. Unbutton a Calvinist. Dip your boots in a babbling
publisher. Have a half-pint of whatever A L Kennedy is on.
Look back in Anger
A CHAP called Ed Anger, an outspoken columnist in the Weekly World
News, an American magazine which specialises in finding the Loch Ness
monster and uncovering the bones of Satan, is unhappy with the Prince of
Wales. The Prince, or the ''flap-eared, horse-faced imbecile'' as Mr
Anger describes him, had suggested that the Yanks do not talk proper
English.
The angry Mr Anger states: ''The truth is the only Brit I've ever been
able to understand was the late, great funny man Benny Hill.'' He adds
that ''most Irishmen talk drunk most of the time'' and ''if you can
understand anything anybody from Scotland says, you're a goldurned
genius''. Us Scots, he says, talk as though we have ''a mouth full of
crumpets''.
Mr Anger is a man of some erudtion. He claims he has nothing against
the British people, as the Americans ''settled all that back in 1776
when General George Washington sent those Redcoat cowards scampering
back to London with their kilts flapping in the breeze''. Obviously he
hasn't seen Braveheart yet.

Jumpstart offers new hope to those who have fallen through the net,
finds Ian Black.
TO jump-start anything you need leads; and leads, in a different
meaning of the word, are both needed and supplied at Jumpstart in
Broomloan Road in Govan, Glasgow. They need leads to jobs. They need
employers to phone them if they can offer a young person a start. They
need people to network their friends looking for leads to jobs because
these leads are the lifeblood of Jumpstart.
They offer self-respect, dignity, and -- most important of all in an
area that the death of shipbuilding and worldwide industrial recession
has left blighted by unemployment and poverty -- they offer hope.
Jumpstart is a 16-week course which was the brainchild of Robert
Gould, chairman of Strathclyde Region, and is a partnership between the
region and Work Wise, a registered charity set up in 1983 to design and
implement training programmes for young people and long-term unemployed
adults.
Work Wise contributes about #120,000 and The Govan Initiative around
#35,000 per year. It has places for about 75 people per year.
Youth unemployment in Govan, according to official Government figures,
is 31% of the school-leavers of 1994. This figure is fudged by the fact
that many school-leavers start no-future YT courses, on which many claim
to be used as ''slave labour''.
Then there are the ''course-hoppers'' -- who move rapidly from
dead-end to dead-end in the hope of finding something they like or a
future, and this confuses matters further. The real figure is probably
closer to 60%.
Jumpstart has a success rate of more than 70%, a statistic made all
the more amazing by the fact that they target young people who are
either disillusioned with the YT chimera or have disenfranchised
themselves from further training by course-hopping.
These are the people who are in the process of slipping through the
increasingly wide meshes of society's safety nets. Many of them are from
''Wine Alley'', as the area near Broomloan Road is called.
It is a blight on the good name of Govan and of Glasgow and has to be
visited to be believed. This is multiple social deprivation, Rab C
Nesbitt land, without the jokes and the gallus philosophy, and these are
the potential apprentice Rabs, though the word apprentice isn't in the
Govan vocabulary much any more, used only when the Apprentice Boys of
Derry visit Ibrox for a big game.
Helen Fitzgerald is one of the people who helps make Jumpstart the
success it is. She is a hugely warm, no-nonsense woman in her early
forties. She says: ''One of the things I like best about this job is
that I know I can make a difference. It's not all about getting them
jobs or more training or a place on a college course. Quite a lot of
these kids haven't been touched by school at all. Success for us can
just be stabilising their lifestyle.
''For some of them, getting themselves up and getting dressed and out
here is a major achievement.''
She is fiercely proud of her charges and their achievements. ''They
didn't ask to be born in Wine Alley. These are good kids. What they need
is a chance.''
One of the problems that she and they face is that there are few role
models. ''A wee while back, before this present course, some of them
were moaning about the YT and about starting jobs. They were saying,
'Oh, you just make the tea and get sent for the pieces', so I asked them
to go back home and ask their dads what their first three months in work
had been like. Nine out of ten of them came back and reported that their
fathers had never had a job. Nine out of TEN!'' She is scandalised, and
rightly so.
Her co-worker, instructor John Reynolds, is another down-to-earth
idealist and both minor and major miracle worker. He says: ''I would
work here for nothing if I could afford it. In fact, if I won the
Lottery I'd still work here. I was born and bred in Easterhouse and it
would be fair to say that I relate to the client group. There's nothing
like the feeling of satisfaction, the feeling you get when, say,
somebody gets a job or you see them getting a certificate in Wordpower
or Numberpower.
''They've never had a certificate of any kind, most of them. It gives
them respect for themselves and for the others. I get up in the morning
and I look forward to my day. My only regret is that I didn't start 10
or 15 years ago.''
What Helen and John and Access Worker Stuart Parker do is give the
trainees training in real-life skills -- in writing a letters, filling
in a form, using the phone, calling on potential employers. Some past
trainees have been as near illiterate as to make no difference. They
dealt with one young man who couldn't spell his surname -- and they got
him a start. He's still there.
They are rightly proud of their successes -- and vaguely embarrassed
by the lengths they go to to achieve them. They talk fondly of Paul
O'Neill, known to the group as Flung, now in an apprenticeship. ''Yes,''
says Helen, ''John gave him the tie from round his neck so that he could
go to the interview. Flung says it's his lucky tie.''
She told me that John had found that particular vacancy by walking
round Govan in his lunch break, canvassing local companies.
The current trainees are beginning to have faith. They are learning
hope along with their training. Says 16-year-old Tricia Stevenson, who
has just left St Gerards's, as have more than a handful of the others:
''My pal told me about this place. A few of my pals got work through
here. It's given me more confidence. I feel as if I might have a
chance.''
Tricia has no O-levels but will be framing her Jumpstart certificates.
Helen hopes to have her start a three-year apprenticeship as a florist
in Partick next week.
Alex McDonald, also a 16-year-old ex-St Gerard's pupil, says: ''I
didn't go to school much but they're all right to you here.'' He wants
to be a car mechanic, and vows: ''If I get a job I'll stick to it.
Another good thing about here is that they teach you to get on with
people.''

RECENTLY my partner Carol received an innocuous-looking letter through
the post. The name and address on the crumpled blue envelope -- of a
type still favoured by an older generation of personal letter writers --
were handwritten. It carried a second-class stamp, the comforting mark
of those in no hurry to deliver. The postmark was somewhere in
south-east England.
Inside was what looked like a page torn from a women's magazine, with
some text and an advert for yet-another miracle slimming product,
guaranteed to take the stones off, just like that.
Attached to the page was one of those bright yellow stickies, used to
chase busy people when they're not around to answer their phones. On
this one was the handwritten message: ''You should try this. It really
works''. It was signed ''J''.
For days we puzzled about which J among our far-flung network of
friends might have thought nine-stone Carol was in need of a crash
course in weight loss. Was it some obscure joke? Or an out-of-season
April Fool? Then another J -- Jean -- said she'd read the real answer
somewhere. The note wasn't from a friend at all. It was a mail-shot, a
rather clever mail-shot, from a direct-marketing company.
At a time when Ministers are still drumming their fingers and
wondering when wary consumers are ever going to start spending with
gusto again, the people whose job it is to sell us things are growing
more and more sophisticated in the ways they go about their task. And,
because most of what they get up to gets debated only in the technical
marketing press, the broad mass of consumers are blithely unaware of the
evolving experiment in which they are the innocent guinea pigs.
For example, I bet you thought the avalanche of loyalty cards launched
recently by supermarkets and DIY stores were just a new plastic version
of the ''something-off-if-you-buy-enough-from-us'' approach to
discounting. Akin to petrol gift coupons. As old, in essence, as the
original half-price offer. If that's what you thought, you'd be dead
wrong.
Of course, they want to win your loyalty by offering cash incentives.
But there's a bigger purpose. Every time you present your additional
piece of loyalty plastic at the checkout, the supermarket adds to its
electronic database another slug of precise information about your
family's buying habits. Down to the last can of soup, lettuce, or bottle
of fizz, the Tescos and Safeways of this world have the means of
knowing, in dizzying detail, what and how much you buy and when and at
which of their stores you buy it.
By means such as these, those who sell us consumables are rapidly
getting to know a great deal more about our buying behaviour. In this
computerised information age, expect more and more sophisticated
attempts, carefully tailored around that accumulated knowledge, to build
a new kind of seller-buyer relationship; one in which those with
something to sell will try to find subtle new ways to influence our
behaviour as consumers.
Those who feed the fast-moving world of consumer goods urgently need
some new tricks to retain -- let alone increase -- their market share.
Brand loyalty is not what it was. Consumers are growing bolshie,
becoming increasingly price and value-conscious. Even Heinz has relented
and is now going to supply supermarkets with own-label beans.
But Heinz is also making moves in the opposite direction to
consolidate the brand image of its own beans, spending millions on an
unprecedented direct-marketing campaign aimed at those consumers for
whom beans still means Heinz.
The personalised mail-shots, complete with money-off coupons, recipes,
and suchlike, have, I am told, elicited a huge response. Consumers have
sent back their own recipes and poems in praise of the tomato-soaked
legumes. One woman even sent a picture of her budgie. Whether it has a
taste for the things or can chirrup the well-worn Heinz mantra, I know
not.
The Pittsburgh-based multinational is not alone. At a time when direct
marketing is rapidly moving beyond the intrusive cold phone call from
yet-another home improvements salesperson, or the leaflets and brochures
which flutter from the folds of newspapers and magazines, everyone seems
to be trying to relate more closely to their customers by building up
detailed information on who they actually are.
You may have seen a series of television adverts for a sparkling apple
drink which likens the contents of the can to a honey-voiced temptress.
The ads suggest that, if you've suffered from apple seduction, you
should phone a freephone help-line. An astonishing 1.3 million people
already have. Yet another customer database is up and running.
There are hundreds of other examples. And lots of organisations which
have traditionally held volumes of largely inert information about their
customers are wakening up to the commercial potential of what they have
on file. It's not quite the Big Brother George Orwell envisaged, but the
increasing sophistication of retail market capitalism has its scarier
overtones.
Loyalty, someone once said, is what's left over when the bribes have
stopped. Well the bribes -- in the case of the latest generation of
supermarket loyalty cards and direct-marketing blitzes by consumer brand
leaders -- are still there. And the relationship-building that is going
on is primarily seller-driven and, largely, covert.
The next time someone tries to tell you that, in the high street of
the late 1990s, the footloose consumer is king (or queen), take the
message with a large pinch of salt. The retailers of everything from
consumer goods to financial services may have endured a rough time these
past few years.
But, by harnessing the memory power of the silicon chip and the
growing sophistication of communications technology, marketing
strategists are fighting back. They already know more about you than you
would ever guess. They want your loyalty. And winning it, they believe,
is about a lot more than price.

I HAVE listened with interest to the various arguments put forward for
devolution and how it will rectify the claimed democratic deficit which
we in Scotland are supposed to suffer from. I have, however, not heard
any cohesive argument as to how we will be able to afford the extra
government.
I think it is fair to assume that English, Welsh, and Irish MPs will
not be keen to subsidise expenditure over which they have no control as
their voters would not thank them for it.
Turning to the equalisation payment which bridges the gap between tax
raised in Scotland the the amount spent, which in 1992/3 was #7bn, if
this payment were stopped how would be bridge the gap? The 3p on income
tax suggested the Labour Party would only raise #450m.
The Labour Party has also not explained how we would cover the
additional cost of a further 112 MPs and their expenses, also who would
pay for the administrative costs of a Scottish parliament.

BRIAN Wilson writes of an article in the Largs and Millport Weekly
News in which an SNP councillor referred to Unionist MPs as ''Quislings
who collaborate with their English masters'' (September 29).
I was the SNP councillor who used that phrase and I stand by it,
particularly in the case of Brian Wilson.
He asserts that the best answer the ''Quislings and collaborators''
could give was when I and my two colleagues on the SNP group in
Cunninghame lost our seats at the April elections.
In fact, I and my two colleagues lost our seats primarily because of
the Cunninghame District Council Labour administration inspired boundary
changes to our wards which in every case favoured the Labour Party.
Wilson also failed to mention that the SNP once again increased our
percentage and actual share of the vote in Cunninghame North and that we
are now Labour's main challengers in the constituency. Likewise, he
declined to mention that the SNP took a seat in Largs, the only place
where the article he refers to was carried by the local paper.

When 26 bright young
brains applied
themselves to a big
new hi-tech challenge,
everyone ended up
happy -- especially the
W M Company, writes
Geraldine Abrahams
EXACTLY a year ago, The W M Company, the world's largest provider of
investment decision support services, advertised for new graduates to
participate in WM2000, a software replacement development programme.
Now, at the end of their fixed-term contracts, every one of the 26
graduates has been been hired by the company.
The firm originated as Wood Mackenzie, an Edinburgh stockbroker,
founded in 1864. It became W M Computer Services in 1969 when it set up
a computer services division, providing three generic services:
portfolio valuation, investment accounting, and performance measurement
(imported from the US).
In the 1970s, W M Computer Services moved into the marketplace,
setting up in-house multi-currency investment accounting systems for
major companies. Such services were then, arguably, unique to the UK
investment market.
By 1984, W M employed 250 people, mainly in Edinburgh with a smaller
staff at its ''regional' office in London. Following Deregulation of the
City of London, the company was taken over by Hills Samuel. The computer
services division was floated off separately, as a private limited
company,and eventually shortened its name to The W M Company.
In a move to protect the business and to become involved in the global
marketplace, in 1987 WM became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bankers
Trust of New York, and since then has more than doubled its staff to
530.
Today it has offices in London, New York, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and
Toronto, with 850 clients in 23 countries all over the world -- and
assets of more than one trillion dollars.
The company provides information to two groups: the owners of money,
like trustees or life companies; and managers of money like investment
managers and fund managers, involved in building up, creating and
trading portfolios growth or income, to meet the liabilities of their
funds.
Three or four years ago, W M decided to take a strategic view of its
business and to create a vision -- W M Vision -- of where it should be
by the turn of the century.
It was acknowledged that much of the existing software which had been
derived from original work done in the 1970s needed replacement, so that
the company could more easily serve a global marketplace, with a full
foreign-language service which could operate in the time zones of
international clients.
An IT and software replacement strategy -- WM2000 -- was established,
designed to operate over an 18-month period. It was an effort in the
order of 250 man-years.
Before WM2000, there were around 40 people working in the area of
systems development at The W M Company. Today, the technical staff
numbers around 100.
In such a complex, dynamic and increasingly demanding business, it was
important to take on bright, highly-motivated and well-qualified staff.
While some of those involved in the technology switch were recruited in
the marketplace and trained in-house, the company decided to go to the
new-graduate pool for the specific skills it required.
''We are at the leading edge of technology, so there is not a very big
market for us to draw on,'' says W M's strategic systems manager Lyle
Barbour. ''There was little point in our going for people with a couple
of years' experience because they would not be able to bring the
technical skills we needed.
''We knew from the structure of the project that we could take people
with a computer background and have them working productively in a short
time, so a year ago, we advertised and received over 850 responses.
''We interviewed 80 and, since we were looking for about 25 people, we
could afford to be selective. We decided to take only Honours graduates
and looked at their academic backgrounds, interviewing them from a
systems development viewpoint.
''We were looking for people who had actually done some programming on
their courses, and the bias was towards computer science degrees or
engineering. All but one had some programming experience in their
courses.''
The graduates were recruited on an initial one-year contract, mainly
because W M felt that, with an untested concept, it would have been
unfair to the new graduates to promise anything more at that stage.
In all, 27 new graduates were selected and the recruitment process
proved to be extremely successful, resulting in all but one (who
withdrew for personal reasons) being offered full-time employment.
The graduates were given an initial three-week training programme in
basic technical skills through a series of courses which were run
off-sites -- followed by the execution of a ''dummy' project which they
tackled in teams of two.
In this, they created screen prototypes which had a representation of
how the framework of the system would look. They used the technical
knowledge they had, under direction. Their communication skills were
also monitored, and trainers reported on problem-solving, teamwork, and
individual work skills.
Since then, some of them have stayed in that area, writing the
''windows' part of the system while others have gone into the
technical/server part of the computer, writing programmes that supply
data to the PC. A further group is working on W M's data team and
providing infrastructure support on the PC network.
Apart from its requirements for the WM2000 project, which was a
one-off, every year the company recruits between 20 and 30 other
graduates from various disciplines who have experience -- as well as
school leavers; and as the existing systems are replaced and continually
upgraded and business expands, there will be increasing demand for
people with these up-to-date technical skills.

THE Millennium Forest proposals for Scottish woodland regeneration and
expansion are imaginative and exciting. Their scale -- and cost -- show
what the investment of lottery monies can achieve. ''They love people
who plant trees.'' That old adage gives the first clue to why a positive
popular response will be maintained: what is proposed is a continuous
process reaching far into the next century and mirroring the way in
which trees themselves -- and certainly hardwood varieties -- need time
to flourish and reach maturity. The effect of this project will be felt
for generations to come. In that time the tree planting, care, and
harvesting are valuable sources of job creation which are likely to be
self-sustaining and capable of expansion. It is true that forestry is
not a labour-intensive business but the scale of these proposals, which
involve an eventual total spend of #100m, must involve significant job
opportunities.
There will also be a massive scenic impact which should be wholly
beneficial given the nature of the species to be favoured, plants native
to these soils whose former flourishing habitat has been greatly reduced
by continuous depredations over centuries. Other public projects which
might have reversed that trend, notably the vast plantings of the
Forestry Commission since the end of the First World War, have proved to
be disappointing and not only in scenic terms, where the melancholy
aspect of their conifers is regrettable, but in the limited variety of
species used. Even the economic value of the commission's holdings has
been less than was hoped, but their management did show the potential
for tourism and holiday making. The new proposals will augment these
enormously.
All the projects must also involve people, local people, and not just
distant bureaucracies and quangos. Each scheme is unique and the
diversity is remarkable though the general thread running through
everything, the recreation of something akin to the Ancient Caledonian
Forest, is a powerful romantic notion with a distinct chance of
practical success. All the other previous lottery projects have
stimulated controversy and discord. This looks like an attractive
exception.

I MUST respond to Raymond Robertson's comments (September 26), which I
believe sought to hide the facts relating to the Scottish Office's
failed response to the issue of school exclusions in Scotland's schools
behind a personal attack on myself.
Raymond Robertson's recollection of the Scottish Office's
parliamentary answer to me of May 23, 1995, on school exclusions appears
to be very hazy in that the answer began by saying: ''The information
sought is not at present held centrally''.
It then went on to estimate the figures for exclusions from Scottish
schools as being ''around 25,000 . . . during the school year 1992-93''.
The Scottish Office clearly could not supply the more detailed
information which I requested in my parliamentary question.
I referred to my survey as being the first attempt publicly to collate
the levels of exclusions for all Scotland on an education authority
basis which, given the lack of clarity in the Scottish Office's answer,
appears totally justifiable.
I find it ironic that the Scottish Office is increasingly unable to
supply information because it is ''not collated centrally'' or ''would
involve disproportionate cost'' only to seek to cast doubts on the
figures obtained by MPs surveying the organisations involved directly in
order to obtain information the Scottish Office refused to supply.
I find it even more ironic that Raymond Robertson sought to equate the
Scottish Office's figure of ''around 25,000'' with my information
collated on an authority by authority basis with all but two authorities
supplying detailed breakdowns of the figures, with some of them dating
back to the academic session 1986/87.
I welcome the fact that the Scottish Office is spending #80,000 on a
two-year study on school exclusions in Scotland but it will be the case
that by autumn, 1996, when the results of the study are due to be
published, most of the new unitary councils will have put their
exclusion policies in place and will be unwilling to review them after a
matter of a few months.
It appears that yet again local government reform has caught the
Scottish Office on the hop.
Raymond Robertson's comments to the press reflect just how rattled the
Government is by this issue which demonstrates the total failure of its
policies in relation to school discipline which is now very firmly fixed
in the minds of the public as a result of the figures which I made
public.

THIS is getting tedious. After Braveheart as a catalyst for feelings
of warm Scottish emotion, now we have Pawnheart. The origin of the Lewis
Chessmen is not in doubt. They are Norse in artistic style, were
discovered in Uig on the west coast of Lewis in 1831, and have been
housed until their recent loan to Stornoway in the British Museum in
London. None of this makes them either Norwegian (or an Icelandic or
Irish variant); neither does it make them Hebridean nor English.
We should regard with suspicion any claim which suggests that they are
part of the heritage of Lewis. Heritage as a concept is much ridiculed
these days and it is probably not capable of sensible definition. The
simple act of burying them on Lewis all those centuries ago does not
make them an irrevocable part of Lewis. Nor should any attention be paid
to the even more misleading suggestion that Lewis is somehow their
natural home, whatever that is supposed to mean. Their absolutely
natural home is the walrus, now deceased, from whose tusks they were
carved. The walrus has no claim and nor, we suspect, do the people of
Lewis.
This does not make us unsympathetic to the suggestion by various
people on Lewis that the chessmen, or some of them at least, could be
housed usefully on Lewis. The standard of small museums around the
country has advanced greatly and such matters as security, proper
display, and more technical details should be possible. But the British
Museum will not like the proposal that its generous loan of chessmen to
Lewis be extended unilaterally and it would be right to be outraged. It
is not decent or fair to accept a loan and then suggest that it should
not be returned. Arbitration might be helpful as an alternative to legal
action, but borrowing and not returning the pieces is unacceptable.

WE wish to express our profound disappointment with the French
Government's decision to test and the recent testing of a nuclear weapon
in the South Pacific.
We believe that nuclear testing will pose a threat to the health of
the people of the region and be potentially damaging to the local
environment.
In addition we believe the action of the French Government to be
contrary to the spirit of the recently signed extension to the nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty. This action makes the future agreement on a
comprehensive test-ban treaty all the more difficult as it will make the
non-nuclear states justifiably suspicious of the real intentions of the
present nuclear-weapon states.
We therefore call on the French President to cancel those tests
immediately.

LORD Lindsay's comments that freedom to roam in Scotland would do more
harm to the environment than good to humanity show a lamentable
ignorance of the true position (September 30).
Responsible freedom to roam in appropriate terrain and including much
woodland is here as a fact and has been so for many years. It is
regarded by the vast majority of Scots as a birthright.
The implication of Lord Linsay's comments is that his party intends to
curtail this moral right (which is already within the law) and to try to
shut off non-sensitive woodlands to the general public and to ditch the
Forestry Commission's public-access policies.
Such ministerial statements are disgraceful and should and will be
resisted.

THE RESTAURATEUR
IS running a restaurant ripping fun or a recipe for ruin? Laurie
Black, respected restaurateur and chairman of Taste Of Scotland,
thoughtfully pours a cappuccino at his Fouter's bistro in Ayr before
answering: it's exciting but demanding.
Qualifications are important and chances to get them are increasing;
but without practical experience, they can look limp. Far better to aim
for a combination. Indeed, his restaurant boasts an example of one who
has benefited from such a combination . . .
Robert Brown, now 21, joined Fouter's at 15, took SVQs on a
day-release course at Ayr Technical College, and has now embarked on an
HNC in professional cookery, also on a day-release basis.
He entered at basement level, washing dishes and working up to commis
chef. He is equipping himself with certificates, but his best
qualification is probably his track record at Fouter's, helping the chef
provide food of a consistently high standard.
Cookery qualifications are important and Laurie Black applauds them.
But he realises that the path to success can be uneven. ''About 95 per
cent of restaurants in Britain close within five years of opening, so it
demands more than cooking ability.
''It's important to offer a service -- to find out what people
actually want. It's no use trying to enforce your own ideas. We have a
sophisticated clientele.''
Black himself had an unconventional entry into catering. When he was a
plainclothes CID officer in London, he frequently visited top West End
restaurants on credit-card fraud inquiries.
Seeing the proprietors at quiet times, he became accustomed to
interviewing them in relaxed, behind-the-scenes circumstances -- which
reinforced his lifelong interest in good food and gave him an insight
into the workings of top-quality establishments.
When disillusioned with the policeman's lot, he found himself in Ayr,
setting up a restaurant called Bumbles -- and later switching to
Fouter's in Academy Street. Now he, his wife Fran and their staff serve
about 400 meals a week, and the bistro's reputation is sky-high.
''It's a fine trade for young and committed people,'' he says. ''And
it offers a great sense of satisfaction.''

<HEADLINE>National epic still to be filmed</HEADLINE>

<ARTICLETYPE>CORRESPONDENCE</ARTICLETYPE>
<RECORDNO>976077006</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AS every literate Scots knows, the history of Sir William Wallace,
Guardian of Scotland, circa 1270-1305, has two sources: the eyewitness
account in clerical Latin, as given in the Wallace Papers, of the
''trial'' in Westminster Great Hall in 1305; and the verse narrative by
Blind Harry the Minstrel, written some 100 years later.
Though the latter bears all the marks of poetic licence elaborating an
oral tradition, the former is as authentic as any historical record can
be: the ''trial'' proceedings were a mere indictment, sentence, and mode
of execution already drawn up by Edward I of England and pronounced by
one of five judges, Justice Malory.
The author of the Braveheart book seems to have followed something of
Blind Harry's account, with a profuse larding of astonishing solecisms
of his own. This is not so much poetic licence as vulgar libertinism.
Whatever it may be, it is indeed not the national epic of Scotland.
The film, labouring as it does under the crippling limitations of such
a script, has moments of scenic beauty, even if Ireland is doing service
for Scotland because Connemara offered tax concessions denied by Carrick
and Kyle.
Battle scenes are impressive, even if Stirling Bridge is conflated
with Bannockburn and Welsh bowmen fall down dead at the sight of rows of
bare Scots buttocks.
While in no sense taking the measure of Wallace, Mel Gibson is a
competent actor -- in any other part. The Horner musical score is richly
mellifluous and may well be the lasting element of this non-epic.
A female member of the cast was heard to wonder why such a powerful
subject had never been written about before. Of course, there have been
many versions by such as Sydney Goodsir Smith and Nigel Tranter, the
former's even having reached the Assembly Hall of the Edinburgh
Festival.
Both BBC Scotland TV and Scottish Television, however, have declined
to consider a script based on the Wallace Papers. Perhaps we may yet see
the Scottish Film Production Fund taking an interest in a proper
presentation of the national epic.

JOAN McFADDEN
reports on a school
whose enterprising
pupils have taken
their bully-proofing
campaign a stage
further -- literally
IN common with many other schools in Strathclyde, Bellshill Academy is
currently addressing bullying problems with the use of the
bully-proofing package now available throughout the region.
But at a time when most schools are just beginning to introduce the
initiative, Bellshill is forging ahead with a scheme which addresses the
issue from a different angle.
''Shout'' is a group of fifth-year pupils who were extensively
bully-proofed in a highly-successful class project in their Standard
grade English class in May/June 1994. They write and devise their own
drama material and have made several performances for parents and
teachers, pupil assemblies, associated primary schools, and at the
launch of ''Promoting Positive Relationships -- Bullyproofing'' in
Lanark Division.
The original seven who started the group have attracted enough
interest from their peers to more than double the size of ''Shout''.
They feel they owe a particular debt to Alan McLean (principal
psychologist) for encouraging the development, and Derek Goldman,
partnership officer at Bellshill Academy, for being instrumental in
helping them put their ideas into action.
The input from the pupils themselves is of as much importance as the
help of the professionals, and this particular project is an excellent
example of good communication and teamwork. During the summer holidays
Derek organised a two-day training course which typifies the work of the
group.
Although this was inspired by the bullying issue, young people's
rights were the central theme, and the workshops were organised in
association with the Scottish Child Law Centre. Drama work, workshops,
performances and debating arenas looked at many aspects of young
people's rights with a view to encouraging the pupils involved to
question decisions taken for them by others, or to examine laws which
affect them directly.
Derek Goldman sees bullying as being an imbalance within power
relationships, and he believes that empowering young people in other
areas of their lives will lead to an understanding of the reasons why it
happens and, hopefully, will provide solutions. Further, empowering
young people provides profound benefits for life skills, especially in
developing confidence and self-esteem.
This desire to give confidence to their pupils is echoed by Alan
Clark, assistant head teacher, and Robert Sommerville, English teacher,
who also took part in the training course. Their role in bully-proofing
Bellshill Academy embraces a whole school philosophy, working in
conjunction with ''Shout'' to highlight the potential the pupils have to
produce their own answers to the problem.
Gayle McSpadyen, 16, had no previous drama experience but is now an
active and enthusiastic member of ''Shout''. She sees the workshops as
being the most valuable learning experience on a personal level, as she
found herself thoroughly exploring issues she had only ever considered
on a superficial level.
Her classmate, Andrew McAllister, 16, had been involved in drama
before, but found ''Shout'' a more satisfying and creative medium.
Almost unconsciously, he echoes the sentiments of his teachers in saying
that his greatest satisfaction lies in knowing that their points of view
are getting across to the parents, and that ''they don't see us just as
a bunch of children''.
Both of them are now looking forward to dealing with other subjects in
a similar fashion, with racism and sexual discrimination high on the
list.
Rosemary Gallagher and Donald Stewart from the Scottish Child Law
Centre provided much of the subject matter which resulted in fairly
heated debate at the training course. As a solicitor, Rosemary produced
details about young people's rights which ranged from respecting
confidentiality to the legal age for imprisonment.
She plans to continue working with the school and is currently
arranging to meet with fifth- and sixth-year pupils to heighten their
awareness and give them a new perspective on their rights.
Donald's input related in the main to the workshops where, as a
trained dramatist, he gave his professional opinion and helped the
participants assess their own work.
The course was named ''You're the Voice'', which was extremely apt as
none of the pupils had any problems in making their views known.
Derek Goldman is cautiously optimistic about continuing this level of
enthusiasm in dealing with bullying. The teachers involved considered it
a worthwhile issue from the start, and created a momentum which in turn
is producing something unique to the school.
''Shout'' is going from strength to strength and gaining more
confidence in professionalism and teamwork, while this particular course
was instrumental in the assessment of further aspirations.
Derek manages to sum up a lot of work in a few words: ''In bullying
rights are being infringed. In Bellshill Academy, we aim to deal with
that by highlighting everyone's rights.''

AN allegation so bizarre, so wildly outrageous as to be almost
certainly true, is sweeping through Scotland's central belt . . . passed
from mouth to mouth wherever people meet and purse their lips before
speaking ill of others and raking over life's ashes.
These days in High Street and supermarkets, at the laundrette or on
the terracing, they are talking. And not just about the state of the
rice crop in Chad, the marvel of Tony Blair's teeth or John Major's
apparently ambivalent attitude towards his cat.
No. The crack is about the latest epicurean outrage to strike the
pie-and-chips-fixated nation. In a word, or five . . . The Deep Fried
Mars Bar.
You've heard correctly: deep fried it is and in batter to boot,
chucked into a rolling boil of saturated fat along with the chips and
the white pudding suppers, swimming in grease as though its life
depended on it.
But the truth is that it is not the life of the Deep Fried Mars Bar
that is at stake.
In a nation that comes top of the chart for ill-health on a scale of
us-versus-the-rest-of-civilisation, could it be that we are compounding
our errors?
The Deep Fried Mars Bar should not come as a surprise. After all, just
7% of Scots are reckoned by anxious health missionaries to follow a
proper diet, take sufficient exercise, and believe in moderation in all
things.
Shaking their heads more in sorrow than in anger, healthy life
experts, whenever healthy life experts gather, assert that in Scotland
tokenism rules, OK. ''I've had my lettuce leaf and slice of tomato --
that's my diet. Now for dinner'' . . . a symphony in saturated fat.
In Glasgow, in particular, cross-cultural eating holds out some hope,
with rice, pasta, and curried vegetables now an accepted part of diet.
But when the pizza is topped off with chips and a pie stands poised on
the fried rice, well, the arteries won't be fooled.
In my schooldays there was such a paucity of fruit and vegetable shops
I imagined that locusts, of which I had heard much in 3B, were native to
Scotland; stripping everything green from the land and leaving in their
wake only the dietary devastation of cake shops.
As the years separated me from boyhood and insectile imaginings, I
learned that some pubs of the more ethnic variety served a drink called
a Fur Coat to the cognoscenti -- no slice of lemon, never a hint of ice.
A Fur Coat, traditionally stirred by the barman's pinky, comprised
half a pint of fortified wine (rejected by the boffins at Peenemunde as
too unstable for rocket fuel), mixed with half a pint of sherry (of a
variety that fell badly between Amontillado and Bristol Cream and might
otherwise have found employment descaling slab steel in a foundry).
Held firmly in the victim's stomach by two saveloy suppers and a chip
butty, this toxic cocktail produced, oddly enough, not the chill of
sudden death but the warm after-glow from which it took its name.
No wonder we are the nation we are today.
That was then, but more recently (like last week) the Scottish Office
honoured a delegation of Finnish dietary experts with a lunch, the menu
for which read like a warning from the Heart and Stroke Foundation.
Some of the diners, who had travelled a long way with sound advice
about healthy eating, are understood to have booked flights home by air
ambulance . . . just in case.
This weekend past, eating at the South Queensferry inn from which R L
Stevenson's young hero David Balfour was trepanned, I asked for salad in
lieu of chips. The ''salad'', when it came, consisted of cold potatoes
soused in mayonnaise, half a canned peach, a slice of canned pineapple,
a dollop of cream cheese, some cucumber and tomato -- the lot topped
with a token leaf of lettuce. It was beautiful, worth a photograph, but
not a salad.
Our national predilection for giving lungs and livers a bad time and
sticking a high-cholesterol dagger through our hearts does not stop at
the tobacconist, baker, and boozer. We really know how to keep the NHS
in a frenzy of hyperactivity, and where better to start than in the
home?
In Lanarkshire, for example, politicians once believed in the
life-enhancing properties of council houses made of steel, riveted
together in the style of ships then launching from yards on the Clyde.
With these, officials could prove to their own satisfaction that a
child, brought up in a house that sweated like a steel coffin on a
sticky night in the Red Sea, would quickly learn how to spell
c-o-n-d-e-n-s-a-t-i-o-n. Maybe a few medical words besides . . .
r-h-e-u-m-a-t-i-c f-e-v-e-r comes to mind.
Town planners and architects, who raise their families in old mills
and converted maltings on the fringe of colouring-book villages, know
that what a young mother, with three under-fours underfoot and another
on the way, really needs is a flat the size of five tea-chests on the
fourteenth storey of a high-rise eight miles from the shops. It goes
without saying, just like the riveted council houses.
And so depression sets in, and death by clogged arteries begins to
look an attractive option. Chips, wah hae! But the process can take
time.
Which is probably what will make Scotland's latest fatty food fad a
front-runner for the 93 of every 100 Scots who are happy to gamble with
their health. In sudden-death terms, the Deep Fried Mars Bar has to be
an Instant.

But 'provocation in role' is no long-term
solution, thinks MICHAEL ROSS
THE necessity for introducing philosophical thinking into our schools
was the fascinating exploration of a conference I recently attended at
Brunel School of Education in London.
One of the guest speakers was a lecturer in education, Victor Quinn,
who has made something of a name for himself as an exponent of the
''provocation in role'' technique whereby the teacher literally provokes
the children into responses which are supposed to awaken them to the
possibility of coming to some insights into various philosophical
themes.
For example, Quinn might go into a classroom and perform some magic
tricks which lull the children into thinking he may have some genuine
magical powers.
He will then enter into a dialogue with the class which will consist
of various pejorative terms ranged against the children -- which all
imply that he, being a teacher, knows best and that they are pretty
ignorant bits of fluff who have never been to university.
Quinn showed the conference a video which outlined this technique in
action. There was an instant response from the children. They began
shouting back at him. Some of the more timid children were clearly
puzzled and perhaps even mildly distressed this grown-up who was bawling
at them for most of the lesson.
But kids being kids, the excitability factor began to predominate and
most began to enjoy the fact that they were allowed to shout back. What
great fun!
But the serious intention inherent in Victor Quinn's methodology is
readily obvious. School consists in absorbing facts from the wise people
who stand in front of these small sponges who, provided they are not
half-asleep from watching the latest 18 video the night before, will
take quite a lot of this stuff into their brains and regurgitate when
required.
How much better it is to shock children into the situation where they
begin to really question assumptions, such as for example, that the
adult in front of them is a font of all wisdom. How essential it is to
question every statement, every belief, every postulate of science.
We are so spoon-fed these days, with a horrible lack of independent
thought in the pupil, that such ''shock therapy'' might be a way out.
At some point, of course, children latch on to the fact that Victor
Quinn has been having them on. It's all been a game whereby this fairly
comical figure with the nice magic trick has given them a good laugh for
an afternoon. (Funny how videos of such techniques usually have fairly
small classes of children sitting in obedient rows! Just like the
situation in the ''bad old days'' before modern techniques.)
Of course, there is always a group of children for whom the exercise
remains a puzzle. Victor Quinn acknowledges the fact that he has to
spend some time ''counselling'' them at the end of such lessons to
ensure they have got the point of what he has done.
The discerning reader will immediately pick up some of the more
obvious objections to Mr Quinn's methodology.
(1) It is all right for some chap to come into a classroom, act the
sophisticated clown, urge a provoked response from the children -- all
right for a visiting teacher for one or two sessions. But one cannot run
any educational process like this, no matter how brilliant and
innovative the session.
Tricks like ''5 + 5 = 9 and that's right because I've been to college
and you kids are pretty thick'' would last only for a short period. I
can just hear some of my own sophisticated Primary sixers . . . ''I'm
getting fed up of this game'' . . . ''I'm tired shouting back''. . .
''Can't I do some sums in a book for a change . . ?'')
(2) There is a danger in destroying even momentarily this view that
the child has of the teacher being a repository of wisdom. Teachers have
enough trouble these days getting over the point that they have
something to offer their ''clients'' (urgh!) without letting the little
brutes start shouting back at them.
I can just imagine some of our charges, brought up on a constant diet
of Rambo, appealing to the Mothers and Fathers from Hell . . . ''What's
this? Your teacher shouting at you . . . I'll have the bastard's guts
for garters.''
Even in a model situation there is the danger that such role play
might seriously damage the bond of essential, mutual respect between
child and teacher. It's all very well a teacher playing the clown during
class drama situations since the child will automatically have the
parameters of the situation spelled out beforehand . . . but to suddenly
shout at them that they are a bunch of half-wits?
(3) Like every other innovation in education, it suffers from
overkill. This sort of provocation in role might be all right for a
one-off but to imagine that it is suitable for more than one session and
applicable for all situations is plainly over the top.
And can we really imagine that many teachers, with their manifold
personalities and character dispositions will suddenly do a Quinn and
bawl at the kids other than during the normal ''disciplinary process''?
There may be one aspect of Mr Quinn's approach which is useful. It
provides us all with yet another opportunity to question what we are
actually doing in the classroom.
There was plenty of provocation in role as we queried Victor Quinn's
methodology at the conference. Perhaps this was the intention, though --
and the magician had performed a very good trick on the adults.

ALAN DONNELLY is a Geordie Labour Euro-MP with a telling story about
German unification. He was sent to east Germany to report to the
European Parliament on the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall. He
was in the office of the Finance Minister of the interim Government of
east Germany when he remarked that that morning's Financial Times was
reporting the agreed exchange rate for the D-mark and the E-mark.
''All the Minister said was 'yes, I've read that, too','' Alan
Donnelly recalls with a smile. ''It was quite true. Helumut Kohl took
the decision. So much for the famous independence of the Bundesbank.''
In fact Chancellor Kohl and a few close colleagues had taken the
decision which would lead to the biggest and fastest economic
integration programme involving a single currency in world history.
And they managed it successfully despite, as Alan Donnelly later
reported, the rest of Europe taking a sometimes judgmental view given
the reconstituted Germany's sudden rise in unemployment and outbreaks of
xenophobia. Much of western Europe likewise came to resent Germany's
shameless ruse with interest rates which had the effect of inviting the
weaker currencies to shoulder some of unification's cost.
Much of the challenge lay in restoring industrial output. ''The whole
of east Germany was an absolutely appalling rust bucket,'' Alan Donnelly
recalls. ''It was obvious something had to be done about industrial
infrastructure and so the Germans went about finding strategic
industries to support.''
As a politician from a famous shipbuilding area now decayed, he found
it galling that one of the industries to rise from the dead -- to the
great disadvantage of Britain -- was shipbuilding. Germany negotiated
special state aids of up to 36%, whereas the rule elsewhere in Europe
was 12%. ''They now have a flourishing shipyard business,'' Alan
Donnelly says enviously, grumbling that the British obsession with
market forces has not properly served the Tyne (and, he might have
added, especially not the Clyde).
But he hails the success of German unification as a bonus for all
Europe. ''If it had failed, so much more could have gone wrong. There
was the coup against Gorbachev which would have threatened us
enormously. OK, the new Russia might not be all that stable but it is
better than what might have happened -- and it might have happened
without Germany's challenges being met.'' The downside is, of course,
Yugoslavia, where Europe was not united and where divisions assisted
chaos and the slide into war.
But with a united Germany, Europe avoided catastrophic westwards
immigration which would have destabilised many economies. ''People in
east Germany quickly saw the benefits and in this way conflict was
avoided. But it could have gone terrifyingly wrong,'' he believes.
There are lessons for the rest of struggling eastern Europe. ''For
example, east German politicians are now filled with much less angst.
Most Germans are still very pro-Europe and the whole domestic scene in
Germany is much more relaxed. There is no longer a feeling that Germany
somehow should not be a part of the international community.''
Alan Donnelly discounts any danger in a stronger, unified Germany.
''Kohl has repeatedly said that as far as Germany is concerned he wants
unification within a European context. Everything he has done has been
done in close collaboration with European authorities.''
Germany's problem now, as it restores its strength and prepares to
move out of recession and rediscover the great days of the economic
miracle, is also Europe's problem. ''If European integration slows down
and next year's Maastricht review goes nowhere, Germany will always have
a huge market to the east,'' says Alan Donnelly. ''If that happens the
problems could be huge. We all know how Europe would be weakened without
the Germans and their power and wealth. It is, therefore, far better to
keep them onside.
''We know from experience what would happen if the EU member states
broke ranks. It would be dangerous for Europe -- in the same way that
breaking ranks by the Europeans was dangerous for Yugoslavia. That
experience taught us, above all, that Europe must act as a single
entity.''

Five years after unification, Murray Ritchie senses there's no going
back for Germany.
PROPRIETY requires no talk of German reunification. As Germans from
east and west today celebrate -- or more likely simply note in passing
-- their fifth year as a single state, visitors are politely requested
to refer to ''unification''. Ancient sensitivities remain stubbornly
alive. German fascists, mainly old men now with no popular following,
like to regard old East Germany, the German Democratic Republic as was,
as the ''central'' part of what was once, and could be again if they had
their way, Greater Germany.
But, mercifully, these niceties and nonsenses are irrelevant in the
daily lives of most Germans, eastern or western, five years on this
morning from the coming into force of the GDR/FRG Unification Treaty.
Berlin is too busy preparing itself for the next century in a clatter of
building works and the din of restoration projects.
This is a good time to ponder a changing Germany's pivotal role in the
European Union because there is a palpable sense of new times coming in
the building site which is Berlin -- and a comforting awareness among
its people that the successive catastrophes of the first half of the
twentieth century are now, at last, disappearing into history.
This city is like no other in Europe. There are still people here who
remember Germany's first defeat in world war, the consequent rise of
Hitler, the whole edifice disappearing in the scorched earth of the
Allied advance, the cold clamp of communism, the coming of the Wall and
its symbolic destruction long years later in the counter-revolution,
and, finally, the chaotic, triumphant integration of the broken and
discredited GDR into one Germany whose peace and democracy are
buttressed by the European Union.
The first time I saw East Berlin was in the 1970s. We had just passed
by the scowling guards at Checkpoint Charlie, which is now a tourist
trap. In a grubby cafe on the east side an old woman toilet attendant
was asked by one of our group -- to the discomfort of our Party minder
-- if her life was better than before the war. She held up her thumb and
forefinger a millimetre apart and said with a turn of the lip: ''Yes --
that much.''
All around were churches and public buildings and great areas of
weed-covered rubble which had lain ignored for more than 30 years as the
GDR economy, the pride of the Communist family, found itself
increasingly unable to cope. Germans who laboured there sat glued to
television from across the Wall, to the great annoyance of their
government and its army of spies. They came to know through television
exactly what they were missing.
They prized pathetic possessions such as polythene carrier bags from
the posh fashion stores on the other side, displaying designer names to
affect sophistication. Their food was dreadful, their lives mostly
miserable, and their aspirations stultified. Germans forbidden to travel
-- they were to be pitied. That, at least, was my first impression of
communism at work.
And today? Those same east Germans -- those who can find a decent job
-- are to be found with their 1980s haircuts and dodgy fashions swamping
the cheaper holiday resorts of the Mediterranean. Some claim lingering
sentiment for the old days, but few would entertain the thought of a
going back if such were possible. Life is too hectic in Berlin, where
restored capital status has fired the Germans' sense of challenge and
common purpose.
To Europhobes who see all German success as a threat, this is worrying
because they equate a thriving Germany with trouble. Hard evidence,
however, points the other way (and Germany was never more trouble than
when it was not thriving).
As the biggest and most powerful economic force in Europe, Germany
bankrolls the European Union which, in turn, has stitched the enlarged,
unified federal republic into a democratic quilt from which there is no
easy escape. This is exactly the sort of Euro-constraint which British
and other Euro-sceptics abhor for themselves but unite in wishing on
Germany. There is a curious lack of logic in this approach.
Whether you agree with him or not, Chancellor Helmut Kohl will go down
in history as a strong and a dedicated European. His long political
record shows a willingness to make Germany powerfully successful but
also a Germany which directs its energies towards the strengthening of a
united, peaceful, and prosperous Europe. Were Kohl a British-style
Euro-sceptic we would have real trouble.
With probably only one more election to go, his place in history is
assured not just because he is good at winning power and overcoming
occasional political clumsiness but because he was the Chancellor when
the Wall came down, a consequence of which was to move the European
Union's border -- which is also the new Germany's -- to the east.
This new arrangement presents a challenge not just for the EU as it
prepares to enlarge eastwards but a defining moment of destiny for the
new Germany. Kohl and his successors will lead the reconstruction of an
old order of European democracy, suitably adapted to the next century.
If they and the EU should fail, a future German leader might be tempted
to spurn western Europe to concentrate on the mess to the east. The
implications would be unsettling, to say the very least.
The average German this morning is, of course, preoccupied with less
grand eventualities. For most middle-aged east Germans the promise of a
cushy life in the west will not be realised in their lifetime. Even
economic miracles, German-style, take time.
Cultural divisions cemented over 50 years in the two Germanys remain
strong and will not be resolved overnight. This is why Kohl and others
have been eager to smooth the past, sometimes to the point of being seen
outside Germany as irresponsible.
Something like 30 trials have taken place against former GDR border
guards. In most cases, even involving the murder by shooting of
intending escapees on the Wall's razor wire, the sentences have been
probation.
Only a handful of men have been imprisoned. They were mostly guards
who shot dead escapees already wounded and helpless on the ground who
could easily have been recaptured alive. Heinz Kessler, the former GDR
defence minister, was given a long jail sentence for ordering the
shootings but his case is now under appeal. Most Germans who suffered in
the east want the Kesslers of this world punished.
Old Stasi (secret police) bosses have the knack of receiving longer
sentences and suddenly becoming ill so that they can be released early
on medical grounds. Most Germans dislike the system, which is too
lenient for some and unfair to others -- but it seems balanced cleverly
enough to contain the problems and pains of unification.
Constanze Krehl, born in Leipzig and now a socialist Euro-MP, sees a
paradox in the new Germany. ''No-one wants to go back to the old way
because most people live better than before. But the feeling is not
better.'' She believes the official unemployment figure of 16% in the
east is fiddled because it excludes short-time workers, exploited women
on low wages, temporary and job creation workers and others. More
likely, the real figure is as high as 60% in some of the worst areas,
she claims.
Germans from the east remain oppressed by financial pressures for
rent, drinking water, sewerage, and seemingly irresolvable battles over
ownership of property previously seized by the Communist authorities.
Much of this property is in city centres and was formerly owned by Jews
or ethnic Germans who had it taken from them.
The courts are now battling to resolve thousands of cases of disputed
ownership as old families return to reclaim their property. Outsiders
observing the backlog of litigation conclude much of it will obviously
never be resolved. The effect is to leave much of east Germany's urban
area in permanent blight. In the countryside the same is happening.
Thousands of families are involved in court feuds over long-lost farms
seized by the Soviets and handed on to peasants. Farmers who remember
their land from before the war now want it back. Meanwhile the land
itself rots.
The lack of a feel-good factor also results, Constanze Krehl believes,
from the clumsy way in which privatisation of state assets was handled
by Kohl's planners.
''Market forces were just too sudden for the east Germans. There
should have been more planning -- too many businesses in the east just
collapsed immediately because they were overwhelmed by competition from
the west.
''The trouble is that we still do not feel united. There is too much
injustice in land disputes and so on,'' Constanze Krehl believes. ''In
that sort of atmosphere how can we feel part of the same family? People
from the west came over to us after the Wall came down and told us we
had to learn to work, to be democratic, to learn new laws, taxation and
social security systems, and so on. They did not realise in our own way
we were quite successful -- after all we had started with absolutely
nothing at the end of the Second World War. Yet when the new order came
about all the promoted positions went to west Germans when
reconstruction began. It is a cause of great bitterness in the east.
''It is all rather curious. No-one, apart from a few diehard
Communists, wants to go back in time. But still we cannot all accept
change. It is a difficult process and easy to make mistakes.
''The important thing now is to integrate central and eastern Europe
into the EU and try not to repeat the mistakes we made in east Germany
after unification.''
Constanze Krehl becomes suddenly worried that she sounds too negative.
''We had DM 180bn transferred every year from the west to the east of
Germany and if you go now to Leipzig you find the second most famous
banking centre in Germany after Frankfurt. So much has changed in the
daily dynamic of the place that it is like night and day. The economy of
the old GDR was kaput -- a catastrophe. Now it is the opposite -- and
that is very good for democracy.
''So I remain optimistic. Ten years from now we will be a very
well-developed part of Germany.''
Like most Germans she wants a more unified Europe with the eastern
states integrated into the EU quickly. ''It is all to do with the
relationships of the past 40 years. There could be people in these
places like Poland and Hungary who want to go back to communism if they
don't see life improving. We have to help them. If we don't integrate
now we will have a problem in the future.''
Opinion in Germany is changing on the proposed single currency. When
Kohl baled out the east with a rashly generous one-for-one exchange rate
between the D-mark and E-mark, not everyone took up the offer. The rate
quickly halved and many east Germans still believe they really did lose
half their savings overnight.
''Now they have their D-marks and they don't want the same thing to
happen again,'' says Constanze Krehl.

AS the person who was privileged to open in 1990 the first of
Glasgow's Open Doors Days, may I say that Jan Jamieson (September 28)
clearly has not bothered to discover the background.
Open Doors started with the Council of Europe and has been taken up
enthusiastically all over the whole Continent of Europe. In Glasgow it
is organised -- brilliantly -- through the Glasgow Buildings
Preservation Trust with, I think, a staff of two but with able and
enthusiastic volunteer back-up.
I have never been one of the
Glasgow-is-better-than-everyone-else-at-everything brigade, but
Glasgow's Open Doors Days are the best I know of and organisations and
individuals from other towns will testify that they lean on, and learn
from, the GBPT.
Those individuals who participate in this can be assured that their
efforts are appreciated by a very wide range of people -- 3500-plus
people tramping over your carpets, no matter how much they appreciate
your efforts with the building, must take some bearing.
The loveliest sound of all during the Days is ''I never knew this
place existed,'' and from that the band of helpers and participants
increases each year.
However, the separate item on the destruction of Spreull's Court must
start bells ringing everywhere. In the time between now and 1999, when
Glasgow is City of Architecture and Design, everyone, and I do mean
everyone, has to know that they have a role to play. It will not do to
leave it to any individual, council, or professional.
Everyone on their guard might have prevented this appalling event
taking place. Everyone on their guard now will make repetition less of a
possibility.

Unsuspecting numpties are queueing
up for 'media studies' courses. Why?
''SKALLIE? What manner of cretinous bloody handle is that?'' wrote
Disgruntled of Dornoch on subtly perfumed, grant-maintained notepaper.
''What the hell does it mean anyroads, for Christ's sake?'' he added,
presumably rehearsing for his pilgrimage to the shrine of St Mary of
Dunblane. Actually, dear Disgruntled, it means ''slate pencil''. Ask a
silly question . . .
Still, he has a point. These days everybody seems to have a fancy tag.
Monty Python started it all with the ''Minister for Piling Things on Top
of Things'' -- like leaked memos and new curriculum policies. Then along
came heid bummers in home economics and technological studies, then the
goose-steppers -- senior management teams, think-tanks inhabited by
piranhas disguised as dishevelled refugees from the classroom. Jumped-up
workhouse owners dubbed themselves business entrepreneurs and gave their
hire-and-fire squads crazy new monikers -- first, manpower officers,
then personnel specialists, then human resource consultants.
Even the zimmer-bound universities crept out of the cloisters to carve
out chairs in abominations like behavioural neuroscience, magnetic
resonance imaging, development anthropology and geofluids engineering.
Where in your mortal puff did you ever hear the likes of that?
Now Dundee University -- seeing no future in degree courses in jute,
jam and journalism -- has taken the Garibaldi with its spiffing wheeze
for a new chair in gender relations. Why not sex relations? Don't answer
that, dear reader.
Sometimes the subject matter is even more bowel-emptying than the
fancy tag. Take communications and media studies -- that's The Skallie's
black beast. Why give the brats that infest our classrooms puffed-up
notions about coming out as doorstepping hacks and invading the little
that's left of our blessed privacy?
Things have never looked forward since that epoch-making day when the
moronic hack pack descended on a darkened train in a remote railway
siding in Wiltshire, hoping to catch our future monarch in flagrante
delicto with the demure Lady Diana. Thank God they didn't realise she
was staying at the time with a hospitable young couple called
Parker-Bowles.
Why should we be exposing our toerags, through this abortion called
media studies, to such moronic creations as tabloids? As readers will
readily appreciate, The Skallie is not one for idle scuttlebutt, but the
world has a right to know that, at his school this week, the aptly named
Ms Shona Legge -- head of media studies and fully paid-up Trot -- has
been extolling the mysterious virtues of tabloids.
Not only do headlines like ''Gotcha!'' (to mark the sinking of the
Belgrano) and ''The Muchess of York'' (to acknowledge Fergie's
non-bulimic figure) represent ''creative and graphic credibility'', but
in the view of madam the brats should have no objection to the big
whatsits on page whatsit. Says she, if that's how the punters want to
see Melinda Jane from Hartlepool or Clarissa from Chipping Sodbury
exercise their artistic integrity, so be it -- it's got to be OK,
because it's market forces at work.
Needless to say, madam looks ideal fodder for page whatsit herself --
in fact, she's probably Melinda Jane doing a moonlight.
Ms Legge will descend to the rank of heidie yet. She has all the
emptiness of cranium and brazen effrontery. She even had the gall to get
some of her temazepam brigade to write to a tabloid, offering them a new
slogan -- ''Let's have your ideas by fax -- we always prefer ideas to
facts. Prize for the best idea -- a guided tour of Wapping and a
whopping great champagne lunch.''
The unsuspecting numpties are queueing up for places on these new
media studies courses at colleges. It's the nearest they'll get to being
a Robert Maxwell -- except for the girth -- or a Quentin Tarantino --
except for the effing and blinding. The failed hacks and washed-out
paparazzi that run the courses will stuff their naive charges with horse
droppings about the merits of experimental film-making (ie, films with
the shape of Mr Blobby but less in the way of content) and modern art
(ie, a disused chamber-pot creatively mounted on broken bricks).
At the end of the course, proudly clutching their recycled paper
diplomas, the new media moguls will sally forth into the quadrangle to
face the hacks and the snappers who should have warned them long ago
what devilish garbage they were letting themselves in for.
A few of them will make it really, really big. They'll be taken on (on
temporary, non-renewable contracts, needless to say) by the very
tabloids their parents devour for breakfast. They'll spend countless
yawn-provoking, mind-destroying days and nights shivering in cars soaked
with the stench of Bovril and cheeseburgers, waiting for Camilla to
smuggle horses into Highgrove House or Will to bump into Di, mistaking
her for his physiotherapist. And even if it's not real smuggling or
bumping (to coin a phrase) -- even if it's a fiendishly clever plot by
these supremely imaginative Royals to deceive the trusted
representatives of the people -- so what? Rupert will love it and you
have to please your great white chieftain in the Sky.
Communications and media studies? Be warned, young folk. Skidaddle now
or you might end up like The Skallie.

THERE were quite a few hitches in this closing event of the BBC Music
Weekend at St Mary's Church, Haddington. The concert had been intended
to celebrate the inauguration of flood lighting the church's historic
exterior but alas, it was announced, this switch-on would be another
time.
Inside, the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra were sqeezed in to the
transepts, a number of string players tucked right and left behind giant
pillars, with percussion disappearing in the distance behind ranks of
strings, woodwind, and brass. Conductor David Shallon, however, got
proceedings briefly and brightly under way with Weber's Overture to
Euryanthe before a reshuffle of the orchestral layout pushed more
strings behind the pillars to accommodate a platform for Michaela
Fukacova, soloist in Walton's Cello Concerto. Her wait for a dud
microphone to be replaced in the Radio 3 recording set-up did not seem
to disturb her concentration any, but while she played with much
animation and expression her location, enmeshed with the orchestra,
adversely affected balance and projection.
Tchaikovsky's Pathetique symphony suffered worst under Shallon's
direction. The first movement came over as a series of disparate blocks
snapped together, while in the waltz movement his left-hand gestures
were proffered gratuitously without response from the players. The march
movement turned out more of a hectic yomp at the double through a marsh,
with the final movement failing to engage the listener in the composer's
angst. A disappointing show of what was meant to be a gala occasion.

OF THE shows opening at Glasgow Citizens' this week, the most
unfamiliar is the work of turn-of-the-century Italian novelist and
dramatist Giovanni Verga.
The She Wolf opens tomorrow and is the first show in the company's
autumn season, Noel Coward's A Song at Twilight following on Thursday,
and Sean O'Casey's Shadow of a Gunman on Friday.
Verga was a leading figure in the naturalist movement of the period,
achieving a reputation -- still respected in Europe -- for his
unflinching depictions of Sicilian peasant life. The She Wolf (La Lupa),
written in 1896 and based on one of his own short stories, tells a
tragic tale of a woman who falls for a younger man in a small Catholic
community. It is a surprisingly frank analysis both of female sexuality
and of men's fear of it.
''I translated the play because I really liked it,'' says South
African David Lan, who has produced a string of plays since the early
seventies. His newest, The Ends of the Earth, will show at the National
Theatre next year.
Giles Croft, literary manager at the National Theatre, recommended his
translation of The She Wolf to designer/director Stewart Laing who was
on the lookout for scripts following his success with The Father at the
Citizens' this time last year.
Lan was drawn to the play's exploration of how an abstract moral code
so easily gets in the way of people's real emotions. ''It's a tragedy,''
he explains, ''and it's a tragedy because people are caught up in a
system of thinking about sex which is not compatible with the way they
feel. Despite all sorts of apparent freedoms, people are still reticent
to say openly what it is they feel they want.''

Festival theatre chief discloses to Mary Brennan how a saucy brochure
helps pull in the crowds
I hung around the Green Room picking up all the gossip I could
The industry is in desperate needs of new entrepreneurs
IN TIMES to come, last year's Edinburgh Festival Theatre brochures are
bound to be hotly coveted as collectors' items. Not merely as a record
of the bold diversity that characterised the inaugural 1994/95
programming, but because of the style -- baroquely camp, succulently
ambiguous -- of the brochure itself.
The moist tarts and well-stacked baguettes on offer at the theatre's
Cafe Lucia have already passed into popular parlance, though I am
assured that the intriguingly suggestive ''Handling charges are not
refundable'' is a standard box office caveat and not one of the in-house
innuendos.
Paul Iles, General Manager since the 1992 renovations of the erstwhile
Empire Theatre began, denies, with a giveaway grin, that he has anything
to do with the actual sauce-ing of the copy, but the tongue-in-cheek
note struck by the marketing has his nod of approval.
In his book, theatregoing is, at best, a risky business. There should
be a definite tingle factor in coming to see a live performance, a sense
of mixed uncertainty and expectation that can be fanned alight by the
bare-punned effrontery of the brochure.
'' We mustn't presume that the public will come in on just the allure
of a title and a picture,'' says Iles matter-of-factly. ''It's important
to describe things for people, partly because there's no continuity of
house style on stage -- we had 140 different events in our first year.
''The brochure is a way of positioning a new theatre in the city. And
while we are reverent to the theatre, we are irreverent to the marketing
of it. We try to keep it as camp as possible, as light-hearted as our
forebears did. And we try to make it sizzle with suggestion! We want the
danger of going to the theatre to be reclaimed as part of the fun.''
For Iles himself the fun and the danger hooked in conclusively at an
early age. He says, succinctly and without case histories, that he soon
learned he was a bad actor, and that what he wanted to do was go into
theatre management. Which he did -- by way of being a cleaner, a stage
door keeper, and an assistant stage manager. A route that was, he points
out, a very practical substitute for higher education and the
now-fashionable sheath of theoretical qualifications.
''Sadly, of course, those opportunities don't exist in as flourishing
a way as they did 20 years ago. Repertory theatres were wonderful
schools where you could learn from lots of differently experienced
people.'' He pauses, then adds dryly. ''I was probably very precocious!
I got to be theatre manager of a company when I was only 21 -- I've been
a general manager for 22 years now. When I began, I managed a 190-seater
. . . '' Now, of course, he commands a capacity 10 times that size.
In the interim Iles expanded his cultural horizons with a 12-year
stint in Australia ''where vaudeville is closer to the mainstream than
in Britain. It's part of the Australian psyche. There's less distinction
between high art and low art in rough, thin cities like Sydney.''
He grins at the happy thought. It was a useful preparation for his
subsequent return to England and Blackpool's Grand Theatre, where Les
Dawson and Michael Clark drew full houses -- though, sadly, not on the
same bill.
But all this garnering of widespread experience -- from managing
publicity in Ipswich to working as assistant to Lord Harewood on the
Adelaide Festival -- is really only a way of financing an incurable
habit: his total addiction to theatre. A habit apparently kicked in
early.
Iles was only 16 when the National Theatre, then based at London's Old
Vic, took him on to clean dressing rooms. ''It was my first job. And I
was completely stage struck. I hung around the Green Room and picked up
as much gossip as I could.
''I remembered the change in Laurence Olivier from Artistic Director
in a three-piece pinstripe suit, to him walking through the stage door
and becoming an actor . . . and having a plate of baked beans in the
Green Room before playing The Dance of Death.''He smiles at the
recollection, which suddenly seems, in the telling, as immediate as if
Olivier and the beans had been that day's encounter.
You see the same brightness in Iles's face when he breaks off in
mid-sentence to ferret among various papers for photocopies that show
the (currently endangered) interior of the King's Theatre in Dundee.
Local people are valiantly opposing the redevelopment of the building --
latterly a bingo hall -- into a shopping precinct.
The quality of the remaining architecture, particularly the
elaborately domed ceiling, had obviously struck deep-rooted chords with
Iles. For everything about theatre -- its architecture, history,
personnel and memorabilia -- captivates him. His abiding fealty colours
most conversations with fascinating snippets of information about past
glories and rumoured futures -- is Cameron McIntosh really going to buy
the Coliseum (which Iles promptly identifies as a Frank Matcham on
Glasgow's south side?)
It's a move that Iles would generally welcome. It would, you see, put
another big theatre into independent hands at a time when Apollo Leisure
are serially monopolising so many sizeable venues across the land.
Theirs is a strangehold that won't necessarily put the needs of the
industry first. And yes, it poses a threat.
Iles is ever-conscious of the piranha pool that laps close to the
elegant plateglass frontage in Nicholson Street. The triumph of the
theatre's first year -- on a turnover of #4m there was a loss of only
#119,000 -- hasn't tricked him into false optimism.
''We've got to have more blockbusters than we've had so far,'' he says
flatly. ''And they're hard to find at the moment. More new theatres, a
lot of them refurbishments, have opened up, far more than there have
been new producers going into the business.
''And the industry desperately needs new entrepreneurs to feed,
irrigate this touring circuit. Otherwise there will be more dark weeks
for all of us.'' And dark weeks are costly. He cites a figure of #30,000
-- per week --just to keep the theatre ticking over.
That sum, of course, has nothing to do with the building debt that,
earlier in the summer, caused crisis headlines. Though he doesn't make
an aria out of it -- that's not his public style -- Iles must find it
galling that the financial travails of the bricks and mortar side of
things somehow spill over, misleadingly, into the public perception of
the theatre. Especially if they, themselves, have never been part of the
thronging thousands who have, in the past 15 months, topped the half
million mark.
Perhaps a hidden indicator of the theatre's success can be found
hanging on its walls. More than 300 programmes and posters, all harking
back to the good old days of the former Empire, have poured in from
people wanting to hansel the new theatre with their cherished memories
of the old one.
Like the 3500 registered Friends, these spontaneous suppliers of
memorabilia are fiercely supportive, willing to buttonhole Iles in the
foyer with suggestions, criticisms, but, above all, praise. And with
good reason.
Who can recall such a kaleidoscopic mix of goodies under one easily
accessible roof -- everything from cutting edge contemporary dance to
Ken Dodd, from musicals to high opera and glitzy ice extravaganzas!
Dance fans keep pinching themselves in disbelief: hot properties such as
the Paul Taylor Dance company are bypassing London to appear,
exclusively, in Edinburgh!
Iles doesn't go in for mission statements -- trends in modern art
administration bring out the scathing reactionary in him -- but he has
clear aims in mind, and most certainly at heart. ''Managed solely for
the gratification, passion, and repentance of theatregoers,'' says the
brochure on its inner front page -- repentance, here, means seeing the
(foot) light often.
Iles himself translates this gleefully camp flourish as ''any good
programme is stuffed with passion, talent, wit, skill, and intelligence.
If it's not, then the public withdraw their support!''
Iles's trump card, I reckon, lies in him being that ideal manager -- a
practical romantic. For while he schemes and dreams of peopling the
Edinburgh Festival Theatre stage with untoward delights such as Rose
English and her complete, seven-steed Horse Opera, he habitually
monitors, and authorises, every penny of expenditure within the
building.
He is adamantly tight on financial control: ''If I get the deal wrong
with a producer, we never recoup the overheads. And overheads are big.
Not because of staff -- we run with a very small staff -- but because
the plant, the theatre, is so big.''
Managing the Edinburgh Festival Theatre isn't any kind of ego trip for
Iles, it's more like taking on the custodianship of a revered heritage
that is both local and universal. Already in his first year, Iles has
generated an incalculable buzz about theatregoing that has percolated
through all age groups and classes in Edinburgh and beyond. Keep
scanning those cunning brochures -- I reckon we ain't seen nothing yet.

THE first two things you notice about Lesley Garrett are not, as her
album covers might have you suspect, contained in her flaming red dress
(or hovercraft as she called it). It's her eyes. As she climbs to the
higher register her peepers appear to be sticking out on stalks, as if
she herself is surprised that she got up there.
The third thing you notice is her diction. Almost percussive, it leant
her opening sortie, Handel's Let the Bright Seraphim, the momentum of a
runaway train. Not that she's ever likely to run off the track or be
taken aback by the notes she finds herself singing because that's the
fourth thing you notice: she's in total control.
This programme perhaps didn't stretch her. It didn't stretch anyone.
It was an easily digestible selection of arias such as Voi Che Sapete
from the Marriage of Figaro and songs from shows such as And This Is My
Beloved from Kismet (which she had to sing twice to satisfy a hungry
audience).
The National Operetta Orchestra augmented these with at least one
television theme tune and a car commercial jingle, playing with easy
grace and a nice mellow string sound, although Faure's Pavane might have
yielded even more tristesse at a fractionally slower pace.
The evening, however, was Garrett's, with her impersonations of coy
page boys, her Maureen Lipman-like introductions, and her amusing,
self-effacing desire to see off the opposition and out-earn public
utilities chairmen in I Want To Be A Prima Donna. Public utilities
chairmen certainly don't earn as much adulation.

Wellbeing is a women's charity working to better inform the fairer sex
on health issues and how to approach doctors without embarrassment.
Julia Langdon meets the woman at the helm of the plan which could save
many lives
HOW MANY women have sat in a doctor's surgery and tried inadequately
to explain just exactly what it is that they think may be wrong with
them? How many of them have been sent home and told to take a couple of
aspirin, dear, and go to bed with a hot water bottle? How many, for
goodness sake, haven't?
It is not that the doctor is necessarily unsympathetic. But doctors
are always busy people. They have a great deal to do and much serious
illness to handle. They have to keep themselves informed and up-to-date
on symptoms and treatments on a vast range of health issues. There are
many women patients with a minor ailment and no dramatic symptoms and
often they go untreated. It is just because of ignorance.
It is sometimes a lack of knowledge on the part of the doctor who is
watching out for problems like heart disease or cancer, but dismisses
period pains, or listlessness, or
''I'm-just-not-feeling-myself-doctor''.
It is also often ignorance on the part of the patient who has neither
the knowledge to assess her condition, nor the confidence to suggest any
possible cause to the doctor. How many of us would dare to ask if it
was, perhaps, something to do with this hormone or that?
Rosie Barnes and WellBeing, the health research charity for women and
babies which is run by the Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynaecologists, has a plan to change all this. It is such a good plan
that, given time, it may bring about a fundamental change in the way we
all approach both our health and the doctor to discuss it.
On the way to interview Rosie Barnes in the imposing palatial
headquarters of the Royal College on Regent's Park, I heard the
brilliant novelist Hilary Mantel talking on Woman's Hour. She was
describing how she had suffered from endometriosis from the age of 18
until she was 27, not knowing what was wrong until, eventually, she
diagnosed herself.
By then her condition was so advanced that she had to undergo radical
surgery and could never have children. The interview ended with her
expressing the hope that by now, 15 years on, such a condition would not
escape undetected.
It was a suitable introduction to WellBeing, not least because there
are three and a half pages on the subject of endometriosis -- and I,
too, know what it is now -- which could help another woman say at the
surgery: ''You don't think, doctor, that it might be . . .'' and thus
spare herself many years of suffering.
When I arrived, Rosie Barnes was on the telephone in her light, airy,
and modern office complex, describing the talk that she could give on a
whole range of women's health issues. She was brisk, efficient,
practical and straightforward. Whatever she does, she gets to the point,
gets down to business, gets on with it. The new project that she has
just launched as Director of WellBeing is itself a measure of that.
She has, of course, matured from the bubbly, fresh-faced young woman
who won the Greenwich by-election for David Owen's Social Democratic
Party in 1987. She is still, however, immensely attractive at 49 and
still exudes something of the summer country goodness which so helped
her during her short political career. Her current job was advertised in
the Sunday newspapers the weekend after she lost her parliamentary seat
at the last election, and she won it from a field of more than 600
applicants. She loves it.
She is immensely interested in women's health, understandably regards
the job as hugely worthwhile, but also enjoys the fact that because the
charity is involved in fundraising, this introduces an element of fun
into the arrangements she has to organise. There are sponsored film
premieres, for example, and there will be a sponsored Wonderbra Week
next week.
The charity used to be known as Birthright but changed its name two
years ago, to avoid confusion with any of the abortion pressure groups.
It was founded 30 years ago with the remit of raising funds for research
and to inform and educate on the results of this research.
That was always taken to mean that research findings would be
published in the medical press and general practitioners could then be
assumed to be informed. It didn't matter whether women themselves were
informed and educated by the latest research.
''I didn't feel that we still lived in the days when women were
satisfied with getting all their information from doctors,'' Rosie
Barnes explains. ''I felt that women needed to have information
themselves and needed to know that they were having a sensible
conversation with their doctors and were encouraged to come forward to
seek help with problems.''
She is concerned, in particular, about what she calls ''quality of
life'' problems. A woman with a serious illness would be referred to a
specialist and receive proper help, but a woman with period pains, or an
incontinence problem, or something related to the menopause, would
probably get no further than a GP. And that GP could be overworked,
uninformed, or not very bothered. How many people realise that 26% of
women still have an incontinence problem a year after giving birth --
and are maybe unaware that it can easily be resolved by simple
exercises?
Rosie Barnes' three children say: ''Oh Mum! Must you talk about these
things in public all the time?'' Her answer is that there is no need to
talk about them in social circumstances -- but no-one should be ashamed
of knowing that there is a problem and then seeking help.
''We felt that it was particularly relevant that women knew what
research had been done on quality-of-life issues,'' she says. ''We
wanted women to be be able to go and have a conversation with a doctor
with a degree of confidence and a little knowledge.
''And while we all know that a little knowledge can be a bad thing,
that old adage has been used to keep people in the dark.''
She is now shining a great big spotlight on those shady corners. It
comes in a loose-leaf folder called WellBeing of Women which covers
everything you need to know about women's health from birth to old age.
It has been produced as a fundraising exercise and a nifty way to
extract research funding from enlightened organisations and companies.
The idea is that a participating organisation will subscribe to the
scheme at the cost of five for each woman employee: that will provide a
copy of the 200-page manual for each woman, access to a telephone
helpline on Sundays, back-up leaflets as required and #1 per
subscription for WellBeing.
And while Marks &amp; Spencer, the Home Office, and accountants Price
Waterhouse have shown the way by taking up the idea, it is not going to
be limited only to those who have concerned and interested employers.
The contents of the folder -- which will be updated annually -- are also
to be published as a paperback.
The women's TV channel, UK Network, is giving away copies on a
promotion; Kellogg's is having discussions about an on-pack offer.
Schools and hospitals are also expressing interest in either the folder
or copies of the book.
Rosie Barnes hopes she will have distributed almost a million copies
of the manual within five years, and aspires to big sales of the
paperback, too. It looks like a good bit of happy marketing, worthwhile
and well done.
There are many people like Hilary Mantel who can only be sorry that it
didn't happen before.

A LONE figure stepped forward out of a black silence into a pool of
blue light, knelt down before a tiny drum and then beat out a furious
rhythm. Now a second figure stepped forward, then a third and fourth,
until seven drummers knelt, each joining in with perfect precision,
building to a huge wall of sound that was a physical presence.
These were the Wadaiko Ichiro Drummers, exponents of ancient Japanese
percussion, and what a thrill their first three ensembles were, ranging
through high-tapping sounds to deep-bass rumblings, their virtuosity
holding the senses in thrall, the reverberations tangible in the chest.
Unfortunately, as their first-half set accelerated towards its climax
so, too, did their descent into over-animated visual effects out of the
Bruce Lee school of choreography.
The second half opened promisingly as if a window were being opened on
a ritual. Five players sat at key points around the platform playing
quietly on xylophone, bells and various other lighter-sounding
instruments.
The intrusion, however, of a balletic tableau by a traditionally
dressed female dancer added nothing to the music and was followed by a
long drawn-out sequence of repetitive flute solos that eventually grated
on the nerves.
The act did not really come together again till very late on with the
return of dynamic drumming.
A tumultuous reception for the end of their routine brought two
frenzied encores that showed a more genuine sense of theatre than the
whole second half put together.

As corporate greed flourishes unabated, Andrew Wilson speaks out for
the consumer.
THE real, unacceptable face of capitalism is the corporate greed now
being displayed by the heads of many, but not all, of the privatised
utilities. Seemingly scarcely a week passes without an outcry over
failure to provide a service promised as is the case with Yorkshire
Water, which has now admitted that it has underinvested, or else
directors receiving huge sums while announcing further job cuts.
Yet utilities directors seem deliberately to set themselves up as
sitting targets for public odium, and even by their on-the-record
statements only intensify the ill-feeling against theme.
Some have tried to turn away anger by saying that the large increases
in dividends have been paid to shareholders who are often customers.
Additionally, others are also giving rebates, but so far these have been
insignificant. Overall, the consumer, poor mutt, counts for little.
Perhaps there is the feeling of making hay while the sun shines as
electoral clouds loom on the horizon which may, but not certainly, lead
to a violent change in circumstance. So why not take now what is
available?
Boards argue they have increased company profits. To be more accurate,
profitability has risen, but how much through their own efforts and how
much due to the pricing structures is a matter for great debate.
In electricity in particular, the tariff regimes are somewhat akin to
golden goslings. Industry regulator Professor Stephen Littlechild has
consistently been outwitted by the companies, so the directors have been
able to claim substantial bonuses based on rises in earnings per share.
But while they make substantial sums of perhaps #1m or so as a result
of a takeover when they can exercise share options granted in earlier
years and compensation for early termination of contracts, the real fat
cats are the merchant bankers, lawyers (particularly), accountants,
stockbrokers, and public relations consultants.
Eastern Electricity's chief executive John Devaney has made #1.2m and
finance director Eric Anstee #500,000 from the agreed #2400m Hanson
takover.
The six bids already announced before yesterday's formal confirmation
of the agreed #2800m offer by National Power for Southern Electric has
been calculated to produce about #150m in fee income.
ScottishPower seems set to spend #34m in its #1100m hostile takeover
of ManWeb and may well end up taking on another #10m in the
Cheshire-based company's defence costs if it does succeed, which now
seems inevitable. ScottishPower achieved pre-tax profits of #378m last
year, so the takeover expense is about one eigth of that total
Southern Electric's directors must be kicking themselves. In the last
financial year, chief executive Henry Casley made profits of #225,869,
Jim Forbes, managing director electricity, #247,017, and two other
directors just under #145,000 each.
That was from converting share options, but had they waited until
yesterday to receive the 1010p a share offer they would have achieved
almost twice as much. But weep not. Casely still has options he can
exercise which will realise a notional profit of #150,000.
The teeth of many grit when these profits are made during a year when
Southern Electric was planning 1100 redundancies over the next five
years in addition to the 1069 created in the previous 18 months -- and
Southern is pretty typical of the utilities as a whole.
Disregard for the human element has also emerged in the Manweb defence
against ScottishPower, where to reach profit targets there will be
significant reductions in headcount if it retains independence.
A survey from New Bridge Consultants last month pointed out that a
typical board director of a United Kingdom Top 500 stock market company
can expect to earn #237,500 this year, with those in the utilities such
as electricity, water, and gas receiving #219,904 before tax but after
benefits such as incentives, cars, and so on.
However, much of the public anger against the utilities is that it is
frequently the same people who were civil servants, and particularly
chairmen, who have been able to exploit their luck in being in the right
place at the right time without having to do too much for the increases
they have received.
And there is an arrogance and an apparent total disregard for what the
general public, their tied customers who have in practice no alternative
supplier, that does nothing but add petrol to the fire of discontent.
That has appeared again, with National Grid chairman David Jeffries
(salary #245,000) who not only made #354,000 through options, but also
so far has faced down Energy Minister Tim Eggar in demanding his right
to keep a #190,000 special dividend when the Grid is floated in
December.
Altogether it is claimed that he will receive at least an additional
#1.5m over the next few months, once the flotation is completed, while
the householder in England and Wales will have just #50 chopped off
bills.
So far, the Government has done nothing but utter platitudes and
threaten a windfall tax. But that is a tax on the company and not on
board executives. However appealing to the better nature of some, no
names please, it is a forlorn hope.

HEALTHY PARENTS HEALTHY BABY, Maryon Stewart Headline Book Publishing,

* PRECONCEPTION care is currently the big issue in planning a family
and this book is designed to cater for this particular angle on
pregnancy. Although it is divided into three distinct sections dealing
with preconception, pregnancy, and weaning the greatest emphasis and
information is contained in the first part.
Medical experts can be sceptical about the upsurge of interest in
getting yourself fit for pregnancy. They advise that standard practices
about giving up smoking, drinking, and various foodstuffs always apply,
but the most important discovery in recent years is that folic acid
plays a crucial role in the prevention of neural tube defects, and must
be recommended for all prospective mothers.
Maryon Stewart emphasises this, and all her advice is practical and
easy to follow, with sample menus, general nutritional information, and
sensible hints on fitness and exercise. The sections on pregnancy and
weaning are straightforward with no startling revelations, and the
overall impression of this book is of a good guide to one of the biggest
upheavals you could ever experience.
MOTHER AND BABY EXERCISE, Emma Scattergood, Ward Lock, #9.99.
* GETTING fit for pregnancy, maintaining that fitness throughout the
nine months and getting back to normal afterwards. This could sum up the
contents of this, and many more books on the subject. Nothing
exceptional, nothing really poor, just standard information with very
little sparkle to it.
FEMALE RAGE, Mary Valentis and Anne Devane, Piatkus Books, #9.99.
* THE sub-title -- ''how women can unlock their rage and empower their
lives'' is offputting, as it immediately pigeon-holes the book as being
pretentious and patronising. This initial reaction disappears while
reading the first few pages. It is a compelling book, wth case histories
and situations any woman could emphathise with.
Traditionally ''nice'' women hide anger, irrespective of the effects
of stifling such a strong emotion. Women who do show their anger are
labelled as hysterical or crazy. Until now, it's been a no-win
situation, but this book could possibly provide a solution, by showing
practical strategies to channel rage into energy, determination, and
strength.
A WOMAN'S GUIDE TO MANAGING MAN, Vicky Hibbert and Sue Baker,
Bowerdean Publishing Company Limited, #9.99.
* AN intriguing title, but this is not the romantic ''how to get your
man and keep him'' type of man management. It is an exploration of the
hazards women can face with their male counterparts as they develop
their careers. Collating information from more than 20 women from many
areas and levels of industry and commerce has produced varied, and
sometime opposing responses. None of them claim to have a solution to
every problem, but the strength of these accounts lies in a pervading
feeling of solidarity.
Far too often, the few women at the top are accused of ignoring other
women's struggles to assert themselves in male-dominated careers. This
is an excellent attempt at redressing the balance by providing relevant
information and parallels for women wanting to enter management and
subsequently rise up to the hierarchy.
WOMEN MANAGERS MOVING ON, Judi Marshall, Routledge, #12.99 paperback,
#40 hardback.
* THIS book is based around the examination of women in male-dominated
working cultures, concentrating on 16 case studies. Despite re-reading
most of it in a determined effort to discover the author's aims, I
remain puzzled.
The case studies are detailed and interesting, but do not indicate
much common ground on which to base conclusions. Apparently, while
giving talks about women in management, Judi Marshall was constantly
asked, ''Why do some women who appear capable and motivated, leave their
jobs once they have reached a senior management position?'' and she set
out to find the answer. The main problem after writing the book is that
she doesn't seem to have found one.
REAL GORGEOUS, Kaz Cooke, Bloomsbury, #9.99
* THIS book will end up tattered and well read, passed from hand to
hand as a hilarious read. Which it is, but it's also a lot more. It's
aimed at women, although I think it would give the average chap a
giggle, and it's full of no nonsense facts about cosmetics, health, and
self esteem. Clothes, make-up and life should be fun but for many
enjoyment is left far behind and replaced by constant worry and
sometimes health threatening obsessions.
Kaz Cooke wants us all to avoid the rip offs, fashion fibs and
downright lies aimed at women from puberty onwards, and look for real
self esteem along with a little pampering. The section on plastic
surgery for example, is stomach-turningly funny, but provides meticulous
research which would make any prospective seeker after perfection think
twice. Recommended for any and every woman from aged 12 onwards.
THE TROUBLE WITH YOU, Zelda West-Meads, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, #12.99.
* WHILE I was reading this I kept getting the feeling that I'd heard
it all before. The differences between men and women have been done to
death, and yet we keep coming back for more. The subtitle -- ''How Men
and Women Can Learn to Understand Each Other'' -- is the magnet which
will have readers plucking this off the shelves. We simply cannot resist
analysing and dissecting our relationships and West-Meads is in there
with the rest of us.
Trained counsellor she might be, but the anecdotal part of this book
reads like a good gossip with her friends. For most of us, sorting out
our feelings can be done by talking to those closest to us, although
therapy and counselling are there for those who prefer it.
However, one of the results of this is the wide number of publications
available on the subject, and the amount of column inches devoted to
love, marriage, affairs, and any other matters of emotional interest. We
are encouraged to talk, to look at our childhood, and expect the best in
our relationships. The Trouble with You does put it all together in one
manageable volume.

ANVAR KHAN takes a sneak peak at unusual creations for the catwalk
WHAT the catwalks of Milan or Paris can't make up for in stupidity,
Glasgow's wannabe fashion designers will. Some of Scotland's youngest
are set to show their latest work this Friday at Glasgow City Chambers.
Among the contributors from The School of Art is a man called James
Wallie. No remarks please, about the boy's surname. It is not an issue.
Of course someone with the surname Wallie can make it as an
international fashion designer. You don't have to have a surname like
Gaultier or Saint Laurent. All you have to do is make a phonetic change,
that is, the ''w'' to a ''v''. In pseudo-French, the line, ''I'm wearing
a Wallie tonight'' doesn't sound so inadequate. By that same token, ''I
shopped at Wallis today'' also sounds classy.
James will be featuring some of his most outrageous creations,
including a rubber dress and bodice made entirely of cycle inner-tube. I
don't know whether it is the fact that students are financially bereft,
or whether inner-tube is indeed a great material to work with, but the
organisers are in no doubt that this dress is a starring attraction,
which will ''rival, nae outshine anything to be seen this season'' in
Europe.
The Art School designers will open the show for other more established
Glasgow fashion houses such as By Storm, Pampas, and Glitterati, who
will be previewing their new collections for winter. BBC newsreader
Sally McNair will host the evening, which is also in celebration and
support of the new Scottish Bobath Centre for children with cerebral
palsy. It is due to open in Knightswood in December.
* The fashion show takes place on Friday at Glasgow City Chambers.
Tickets are #10 and are available from The Scottish Bobath Centre, 2030
Great Western Road, Knightswood, Glasgow G13 2HA Tel: 0141 950 2922.

Labour's last General Election win is a distant memory. Margaret
Vaughan looks back at the issues which confronted the electorate in 1974
IT WAS the year a chemical explosion killed 28 people in Flixborough,
and a wave of IRA bombings brought carnage to Guildford and Woolwich and
Birmingham, leaving 25 dead. It was the same year Nixon's stubbly jowls
quivered in living rooms around the world as he resigned, on television,
in disgrace, over Watergate. It was the year Canada pushed Pierre
Trudeau on to the world stage, and the year Golda Meyer was pushed off
before the Golan Heights erupted. Slade were stomping up the charts in
platform shoes and flares, Gary Glitter was a strange force in the land
of pop, and John Denver was still singing his plaintive ode to Annie.
It was 21 years ago, 1974. And it was the last time Labour won a
General Election.
My, it all seems such a long time ago. Less a stroll down memory lane,
more a whizz back with Stephen Hawking to a time not of another age, but
on another planet.
It should be a sobering thought for those gathered for the party's
annual conference and therapy session at Brighton that since the party
last held power, Nixon has been rehabilitated, the wounds of ravaged
Ulster are being salved, Gary Glitter has retired at least 12 times and
John Denver's Annie left him long ago. And an entire generation has
grown up with no memories of political life beyond those of Mrs
Thatcher.
A week today, October 10, it will be exactly 21 years since Labour
last won a General Election. It's not a cause for celebration, and there
are unlikely to be any anniversary parties, not when Tony Blair knows
that the key to the door of No 10 still remains elusive. Whether it
stays beyond his -- New Labour's -- reach may depend in some part on how
his ''vision thing'' plays not just to the activists gathered at
Brighton, but to the electorate for whom Labour in power is a dim
memory.
If a week is a long time in politics, and an interminably sore seven
days in the life of a leader at conference, 16 years is a hell of a long
time to wander in the wilderness of opposition.
In March 1974, Harold Wilson squeaked to power in the first of two
General Election victories that year. He promised conciliation, a social
contract, a soothing of the industrial wounds that marked, what he
termed, Ted Heath's Dark Age.
Then, as now, it was social discord, high unemployment, and economic
woes which mattered most to the voters. Then, as now, the Labour
leadership held out the hope of a more consensual society.
The year 1974 had opened in a disturbed political climate after 12
months of exceptional instability throughout the UK. Newspapers of the
time describe a country under siege, a sense of crisis gripping the
nation.
A state of emergency was in force, a three-day week was restricting
industrial production, high inflation was accelerating. There were fears
of food riots and much talk of a national government.
Heath's hated Industrial Relations Act, designed to quell the
industrial unrest that marked the sixties, was the source of great
conflict between government and trade unions.
Wilson, according to his biographer, Ben Pimlott, sought to create a
mood of national harmony.
Strikes had been a problem in the sixties. In the inflation-ridden
early seventies they became a plague, the British disease. Government
had tried several tacks. After being forced to settle the 1972 miners'
strike on the miners' own terms, Heath had adopted a statutory policy
which began with a compulsory standstill on wages, followed by phased
rises.
Disaster struck two days before an announcement of Phase Three when a
new war broke out in the Middle East, slashing Britain's oil supply and
quadrupling the oil price. Energy became the issue, with a knock-on
effect for the coal board's latest dispute with the miners.
The miners imposed an overtime ban and threatened to strike. In panic,
Heath announced a three-day week to restrict consumption of fuel. In
February 1974, the result of the miners' ballot showed 81% in favour of
a strike. On February 7 Heath called an election, making it a
single-issue campaign on the theme ''Who Governs Britain?''
The voters patently didn't give him the answer he wanted. They had
other things on their minds, apart from the miners, not least price
rises which Heath had once promised to cut at a stroke.
Labour's campaign theme was not about the miners or militants, but the
disastrous failure of three-and-a-half years of Tory government which he
claimed had turned Britain from the path to prosperity to the road to
ruin.
It was widely assumed the Tories would win by a landslide. There was
little in Labour's manifesto to frighten voters. The bogey of Labour
extremism seemed irrelevant. Conditions, voters believed, could scarcely
be more extreme than they were.
Labour promised to renegotiate Britain's terms for entry into the
Common Market, into which Heath had led the country in 1972, and in the
last few days the miners were pushed into the background. Labour won.
With only four more seats than the Tories, but polling fewer votes,
Wilson knew he had to go back to the country. There was talk of the
Tories becoming the natural party of opposition. The Common Market
threatened to tear both main parties apart.
There followed, for Labour, a troubled summer. Scandals broke, most
were proved to be lies, but the tainted edge clung. Wilson's
oft-remarked paranoia in that summer seems with hindsight -- and the
subsequent evidence of disaffected MI5 agents -- to have been well
marked. That there was a rogue element in the secret services intent on
destroying Wilson and Labour in the summer of 1974 seems now to be
accepted.
There was a deepening crisis in Northern Ireland, the Diplock --
no-jury -- courts were set up and a new wave of terrorism began.
Essential services broke down in the province and law and order could
barely be maintained.
Labour went back to the voters in October promising only that it would
carry on: Labour keeps its promises was the theme. Wilson conjured up
the spectre of life under Heath, of two million out of work, dark
streets, unlit offices, TV curtailed . . . ''a frozen, broken-back
Britain ruled under a state of emergency''.
In a last desperate throw, Heath called for a national coalition. He
lost and Labour won in October, but only just. Its majority dwindled to
three. It hirpled on, with the help or hindrance of 39 minor party MPs.
And the rest, of course, is history.
1974. It seems a long time, a very long time, ago.
There were fears of food riots and much talk of a national government

As a new card is launched, the debate over 'scratchaholics' rages on.
Stephen McGinty examines the moral and financial issues.
IN THE queue at the cigarettes and alcohol counter of Gateway in
Drumchapel shopping centre, Glasgow, the first five women are indulging
in another vice. Scratch cards. Harmless tickets to financial freedom,
or the first few steps toward an addiction? Yesterday, Littlewoods
joined the argument by launching an assault on Camelot's corner of an
increasingly controversial market.
Since the spring launch of the National Lottery scratch cards, just
under a billion tickets have been sold. After a post-launch peak of 44
million, weekly sales have stabilised at 24-25 million. Littlewoods
football pools are suffering losses to the Lottery -- last month the
company announced there would be 520 redundancies from its 3200
workforce.
The nationwide launch of their charity scratch cards after initial
test runs in the north-east of England is seen as an opportunity to
fight back against the domination of Camelot, the company behind the
National Lottery.
Yet, as concerns grow over the possibility of addiction to scratch
cards, a lobby of experts and politicians is calling for warnings to be
printed on cards and a stronger age restriction on their sale.
The Liberal Democrats, during their party conference in Glasgow, voted
to ban scratch cards if they form the next government. Better chance of
winning a million, some might say, yet it is the tip of a growing
movement. Labour's Shadow Heritage Secretary, Chris Smith, has already
written to his government counterpart, Virginia Bottomley, asking for
health warnings to be printed on cards.
A counselling service and helpline has been set up by Tranx Release,
based in Nottingham, while Gamblers Annonymous has released a statement
saying that more than 20% of new members are driven to its doors by the
cards, which offer varying odds.
The Joseph Rowntree Foundation issued an independent report
highlighting the ''addictive nature'' of the Instants game. The Gaming
Board of Great Britain has called on the age limit to move from 16 to
18-year-olds.
Labour's Smith put his finger on the problem when he said: ''All the
experts agree that the most addictive pastimes are those in which the
interval between staking a bet and hearing the result is shortest. With
scratch cards, this interval can be as little as 10 seconds.''
The odds of winning the #50,00 jackpot in the National Lottery scratch
card are one in 2.5m. The odds in the Littlewoods version are slightly
better -- one in a million. For winning any prize, from #1 upwards, on
the Lottery cards the odds are between one in 5.37 and one in 5.46;
Littlewoods offer chances of one in 4.6.
And so to Drumchapel.
Iain Craig, the security guard who stands and watches the women buy
card after card after card, is sure it is addictive -- but only to
certain types. ''You get some people who'll simply buy a couple. Then
there are the others who'll buy five or ten every day or so. No-one
takes the money -- if they win a tenner they'll take it in cards.''
Outside, Teresa Flynn answers the question ''how many lottery tickets
do you buy'' swiftly but shrewdly. ''Two each week, and I'm not
addicted. Was that your next question?'' Her friend, Christine Barr,
buys five each week if she can afford it, two if she cannot. But both
believe a girl they know is hooked. ''As soon as she gets her wages she
buys 10. As soon as the packet's in her hand.''
Carol Robertson, an unemployed mother of two young children, buys five
a week. The cost is built into her weekly budget. When did she last win?
''I won #100 this morning, thanks for asking.'' But she can see the
gradient of the slippery slope. ''Friends buy two or three, lose, then
buy another two or three trying to make up just what they have lost. It
is a vicious circle. But I buy five and that's me.''
Her husband, however, was behind a woman in the post office who bought
50. The counter attendant asked twice if she was sure of the amount.
''But she just bought them -- it's madness,'' Mr Robertson said.
Not madness, however, according to Professor John Davies, an expert on
addiction at Strathclyde University's Centre of Occupational and Health
Psychology. It is, in his opinion, simply a lack of self control.
It is a difficult matter to discuss. While alcohol and drugs have
elements that can be described as addictive to certain people, a scratch
card does not. A person who becomes addicted to drink or drugs can do so
through a combination of the sensation either one produces, his social
circumstances, and mental make-up. Yet as a scratch card itself has no
addictive properties, the problems lie with the person buying it.
Professor Davies said: ''I think people play scratch cards because
they want to. If they play them too often that is their own
responsibility. If we continue to say that things are addictive then we
will have addicts to everything. We already have chocoholics,
shopaholics -- what next? We have to stop thinking of them as sick, but
as lacking in self-control.''
A spokesperson for Littlewoods said: ''There is no firm evidence that
scratch cards are addictive, but there is a certain person who will be
carried away in the excitement of a win and will buy more tickets.''
Littlewoods have no plans to print warnings on the cards.
Alan Twigg, Scottish spokesman for the National Lottery, commented:
''There has been speculation, and it's still early days, that people
will overspend. But we would bring it back to the fact that the average
amount people spend is #2 on cards and that in no way indicates
addiction.
''Inevitably with anything, whether it is in pubs or high streets,
there will be some people who are going to do things to extremes, but by
and large people are being sensible about it.''
But not the woman in Newton Mearns. A friend saw her as she queued for
bread and milk. ''She bought 10, scratched them, bought another 10,
scratched them, and finally bought 10 more. She was becoming
increasingly agitated. In fact, it was rather frightening.''

Irish bishops are questioned: John Cooney explains why Rome is so
worried
THE presence in Ireland of a senior Vatican official to quiz bishops
about the torrent of sex scandals that have hit the Catholic Church is a
clear sign that Pope John Paul II is deeply worried about morale in the
Barque of St Patrick. Archbishop Jorge Mejia, secretary of the Holy
See's powerful Congregation of Bishops, returned to Rome yesterday with
a voluminous report on child sex abuses involving priests that will make
grim reading for the Pontiff.
As Archbishop Mejia was conducting his special inquiry in Donegal on
Sunday, the Primate of all-Ireland, Cardinal Cahal Daly, offered ''the
most abject and most humble apology'' to the victims of sex abuse and
their families.
Referring to ''wave after wave of scandals crashing and breaking
against the church at this time,'' the 78-year-old prelate urged the
church to face up to the truth. He accepted it was not an answer to
attack the media, despite instances of ''tabloid ooze''.
Despite the cardinal's advice, angry Sunday Mass-goers ushered an
Irish television crew unceremoniously out of St Fintan's Church in a
Dublin suburb. The crew had permission to film a sermon explaining a
loan of #27,500 by the archdiocese to a local priest in an out-of-court
sex abuse settlement with a former altar boy. But as the cameraman
approached the pulpit, members of the congregation left their pews and
threw him out. .
Elsewhere on Sunday, the people of Wexford listened to an attack on
the media in a letter from Monsignor Richard Breen, the temporary
stand-in for Bishop Brendan Comiskey, who is being treated for
alcoholism in an American clinic.
Even more extraordinarily, on Irish radio yesterday morning Archbishop
Desmond Connell of Dublin apologised for misleading people about the
circumstances surrounding the #27,500 loan he had authorised for Father
Ivan Payne. The archbishop still insists he has never paid any
compensation to clergy involved in sex abuse cases.
Despite the apology, critics remain unsatisfied. Also, there is unease
about secret church funds that pay out such monies. Nor did the
archbishop report this case to the police.
The common theme in the current media exposures is that documented
evidence of the deviant sexual behaviour of some clergy has come into
the public domain as a result of journalistic interrogation, not
ecclesiastical openness.
The most prominent cases include the child-bearing affair that Bishop
Eamonn Casey conducted with American divorcee Annie Murphy; the
imprisonment in Northern Ireland of Father Brendan Smyth on numerous
paedophile charges; and the current best-seller by a priest's
housekeeper, Phyllis Hamilton, in which she reveals that she was married
for years to Father Michael Cleary, a popular radio padre who took a
hard line against contraception and divorce.
Bishop Comiskey's flight to America exposed him to a media hammering.
There were reports of alleged drunkenness and of first-class trips at
more than #4000 to Bangkok, where he stayed in a luxury $500-a-night
suite hotel suite.
It was also reported that Bishop Comiskey was worried about how the
public would judge his handling of two complaints of sex abuse against
priests in his diocese.
In embarrassing court cases that have affected at least 12 of the
country's 26 dioceses, an authoritarian church system with an addiction
to secrecy has not been honest and forthcoming.
In what is the most serious credibility crisis ever faced by a once
all-powerful Irish Catholic Church, a defective response from its
lacklustre leaders and its hapless spin-doctors has produced a unanimous
diagnosis that it needs a drastic review of communications procedures.
0  This tension is reinforced by the views of many churchmen that the
media is obsessed with promoting a permissive agenda to undermine
traditional Catholic values on marriage. There are strongly held fears
that the media is exploiting the scandals to weaken the Catholic
Church's opposition to divorce.
However, if Archbishop Mejia is an accurate reporter of the Irish
Church scene, he will inform Pope John Paul that most of the tabloid
ooze in Ireland is church-sourced. It is the Catholic Church, not the
media, that needs to clean up its act.

<HEADLINE>Ministers agree to scrap road tax for older cars</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976077027</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ROAD tax on all cars more than 25 years old is to be scrapped, it was
learned yesterday.
The announcement from the Government -- expected soon -- will please
classic car owners and was welcomed by the AA, which is keen to see car
tax scrapped completely, and by the RAC.
However, the plan has annoyed the Society for Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, which is keen to see incentives for owners to get rid of their
''old bangers''.
The expected move follows lengthy Government consultation with
interested parties on vehicle excise duty for cars whether they were on
the road or not.
Results of that consultation, which ended in June, have still to be
announced. However, it is thought that, despite opposition from
Environment Secretary John Gummer, the Department of Transport and the
Treasury have agreed to exclude cars which are more than 25 years old.
An AA spokesman said: ''Exempting older cars is a sensible,
administration-free way of solving a problem. However, we would like
assurances that other motorists are not asked to make up for the
short-fall in tax that the exemption will create.''
The AA added: ''Most cars over 25 years old are well maintained and
serviced, so we have no environmental problem with this plan.
''Ideally, we would like to see VED phased out for everyone and the
tax put on petrol instead.''
A Government consultation paper on plans to have all cars taxed,
whether in use or not, was published in March. The intention was to cut
down on VED evasion -- estimated to cost the Treasury more than #160m a
year.
''Ministers are still considering the results of the consultation,''
said the Department of Transport yesterday.
Mr Richard Woods, the RAC campaigns manager, said: ''The RAC fully
supports this move to exempt cars more than 25 years old. RAC research
has shown the clear connection between regular maintenance and emission
levels rather than age and emission levels.
* Meanwhile, TV personality Fred Dibnah rode around Parliament Square
in London yesterday on his 1912 steamroller, Betsy, as a protest over
the Government decision to introduce a #150 road tax on steamrollers.

SCOTLAND's biggest showjumping event was thrown a lifeline yesterday,
hours after it was officially cancelled.
Organisers of the Glasgow International Showjumping Grand Prix, due to
be held in January, first issued a statement saying the event had been
cancelled due to lack of sponsorship.
Then, hours later, a potential sponsor came forward and raised hopes
that a #200,000 rescue deal could be put together. A decision will be
made within 36 hours.
The chairman of the organising committee, Mr Raymond Blin, said the
anonymous white knight was already involved in the showjumping world.
''He is interested enough to ask us for facts and figures about last
year's event and what we have done for next year's. If he can't help
out, it will be cancelled.
''We want to explore all possibilities to try and make sure this event
goes ahead.''
Mr Blin said they were #200,000 short of the #700,000 needed to stage
the grand prix. He added that the lack of interest from terrestrial
television companies might account for the failure to attract a major
title sponsor.
There were currently no outstanding debts for the 1996 event and up to
150 people had already taken part in qualifying competitions. About 250
people were expected to participate in the finals.
Despite making a loss last year -- its first year -- the Grand Prix
attracted 18,000 people.

THE increasing importance that the law is playing in football was
underscored yesterday when one of Scotland's leading business law firms
pulled off a signing akin to that of Gascoigne joining Rangers.
Sports broadcaster Jock Brown has been signed for an undisclosed fee
by the Glasgow-based firm of Harper Macleod, which came in for criticism
three years ago when it became the first law firm in Scotland to set up
a sports law unit.
However, managing partner Lorne Crerar said: ''Some of the criticism
we got in the press was that we were involved in ambulance chasing and
that law should be kept out of sport.
''The creation of the department was a response to need. It wasn't
actually creating a requirement. Jock's joining us is just a further
recognition that there is that need there.
''People are recognising -- with the Jean-Marc Bosman case,
discipline, and the Crown becoming much more involved -- that legal
assistance is necessary.''
Mr Brown said he would be ''specialising in sports law -- a field in
which I have a great deal of interest''.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth was accused yesterday of jumping
the gun over the publication of a table comparing the number of senior
staff earning more than #42,000 a year appointed by the 29 new
single-tier councils.
Mr Forsyth warned that some of the councils appeared to be appointing
too many highly paid senior staff and said he had ordered an
investigation by Scottish Office officials.
The table was immediately attacked by the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities as a ''crude and premature analysis'' and doubt was cast on
the validity of the comparisons by other councils.
The table states that Labour-controlled North Lanarkshire Council has
so far appointed 39 senior staff earning more than #42,000.
This compares with 34 in Glasgow, which has almost twice the
population, 23 in Fife, and 11 in Edinburgh, both of which are larger
than North Lanarkshire.
Mr Forsyth is currently considering whether to instigate a formal
inquiry into ''jobs for the boys'' claims over some of the North
Lanarkshire appointments which have been passed to him by the Staff
Commission.
However, last night North Lanarkshire leader Councillor Harry McGuigan
said only 31 appointments had been made. A total of 38 were planned
which would cover the entire management team and the tier below.
The table shows Edinburgh as appointing 11 staff but this is only the
main directors and the council still has to appoint all the deputes.
Councillor McGuigan said North Lanarkshire had tried to move ahead
fairly quickly in appointing staff as it had wanted to secure the best
people. He said he would be ''astonished'' if, when all the council
appointments were complete, North Lanarkshire was near the top of the
list.
Cosla's Labour vice president, Councillor Keith Geddes, said councils
were merely doing what the Scottish Office had wanted by creating
individual management structures to suit their own areas.
''Is he now saying that he wishes to dictate council structures when
we are building councils to meet the widely differing needs of widely
different council areas?'' he asked.
On staff numbers, Mr Forsyth said in a letter to Ayr MP Phil Gallie
that the table showed there seemed to be some considerable variation
between councils of similar size and the number of senior officials
planned or appointed so far.
''The picture is, however, not complete as many councils are still
completing their management structures and I have asked my officials to
investigate the position,'' he wrote.
The Scottish Secretary added that he believed the reform of local
government offered immense potential for the new councils to develop
their enabling role with increased scope to deliver services in a more
flexible way.
''Some of the new authorities are looking at their structures to
achieve this but sadly it seems that some others are not in tune with
the new thinking.''
Mr Forsyth also made it clear that the authorities would not receive
any more cash to pay for reorganisation unless he believed it was fully
justified.
Councils have already received #36m this year and Cosla has asked for
a further #10 to #15m to meet transitional costs.
Last night, Councillor Geddes said the Scottish Office had asked for
more information regarding the additional requirement. It seemed
premature for the Scottish Secretary to make such sweeping judgments
when he did not have all the information to hand.

TWO disciplinary hearings are to be held by Shetland Islands Council
following an incident at Sullom Voe tanker harbour 10 days ago.
A marine pilot employed by the council will face a hearing before
marine operations director George Sutherland this morning.
A second member of staff will go before a disciplinary hearing on
Friday, in connection with the same incident, council chief executive
Malcolm Green confirmed last night.
The hearings follow events early on Sunday, September 24, when a pilot
allegedly crashed his car.
BP, the operators of the oil terminal, confirmed that their security
staff later refused a pilot access to a tanker, after forming the
opinion he might not be in a suitable condition.

TWO men were yesterday jailed for gun attacks during a drugs war in
Paisley.
John McLaughlin, 27, was jailed at the High Court in Glasgow for 12
years for attempting to murder a man last March. He walked into the Park
Bar in Thomas Street, Paisley, selected his victim and shot him twice in
the head and face at close range.
Mr John Kelly, 26, survived, although his eyesight is damaged and he
has been left permanently disfigured.
Gerard McTavish, 32, of McGowan Street, Paisley, was jailed for six
years for shooting his victim in the leg.
McLaughlin's brother Drew was shot and murdered near his home in
Linwood two days later, the court heard.
The manager of the Park Bar, Mr Stephen McDonald, 31, told
Advocate-depute Mr Bill Totten, prosecuting, that he did not know the
premises was in the middle of a drugs war when he had taken over a month
earlier.
Mr McDonald admitted he had been ''too frightened'' to pick out
McLaughlin at a police identification parade after the shooting, but the
next day he told police he was the gunman.
He said he was surprised when he looked through a book of police
pictures of criminals and saw many of his customers. Mr McDonald said:
''I don't work there any more.''
Earlier on the day of the shooting, McLaughlin and McTavish dragged a
friend of Mr Kelly, Mr John Kennedy, from a pub in the town's Caledonia
Street in broad daylight in front of customers. They bundled Mr Kennedy
into the back of a van and shot at him before shooting him in the leg in
a car park.
When the van driver, who was installing karaoke equipment in the
Caledonia, complained McLaughlin grabbed him and said: ''Go away or
you're dead.''
McLaughlin was also found guilty by a jury of terrorising a teacher in
a pub, assaulting him, and threatening to kill him and his family. The
teacher had tried to calm McLaughlin when he shouted at a barmaid.
McLaughlin was told in court he was fortunate not to be facing a
murder charge.

THE EU funding system should be changed to provide a special budget
for pan-Scottish tourism projects, the chairman of the Scottish Tourist
Board yesterday told a European Parliament group.
Addressing the tourism group in Brussels, Mr Ian Grant said Scotland's
tourist industry was losing out because of funding restrictions.
He told Euro-MPs, members of the European Commission, and tourism
leaders that it was difficult to co-ordinate bids for pan-Scottish
projects because funding was allocated on a regional basis to designated
areas. However, Mr Grant failed to win the backing of the Scottish
Office.
In his address, The Importance of Tourism in Peripheral Areas, he
said: ''Tourism is Scotland's largest industry and vital to our economy.
It is time to cut through the restrictions which have tied our hands and
prevented us from maximising European funding.
''It is difficult to get pan-Scottish projects off the ground and the
industry as a whole is losing out on the use of vital funding to promote
Scotland as a single destination.
''I am calling for EU backing to ensure that part of the European
Regional Development Fund budget for tourism projects in Scotland is
earmarked for all of Scotland.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said the STB was currently allocated more
than #17m a year, some of which was spent on pan-Scottish projects.
He added: ''The Scottish Office is satisfied that any additional
European money can be used to supplement their activities in specific
areas.''

A WOODLAND as a burial place has been approved by Edinburgh District
Council.
There will be space for 500 lairs on Corstorphine Hill. A silver birch
will be planted on each grave as a memorial. Wildflowers will be
encouraged throughout, along with other species of trees.
A report to the environmental services committee recommended that
lairs should be bought in advance at a cost of #250, plus a burial
charge of #190 and #8 for a certificate of the right to bury.
The woodland burial carries certain conditions, laid out in a legal
agreement. These include: no memorials, headstones, kerbs, flower vases,
or other forms of memorial; and, to avoid the trampling of the
wildflowers, no visits to individual graves.

AN ARMED bank robber gave himself up after red smoke poured from his
bag of cash, a court heard yesterday.
Ex-soldier Anthony Dale, who was carrying a blank-firing pistol, was
challenged by a passer-by and agreed to wait for the police.
Dale, 36, was jailed for three years after he admitted placing a
teller in a state of fear and alarm by passing a demand note, and
robbing the TSB in Troon of #2340.
He also admitted carrying an 8mm Beretta pistol during the raid on the
Ayr Street bank last January 12. He was cleared of threatening to shoot
passer-by Martin Brown in Academy Street, Troon.
The High Court in Kilmarnock heard that when Dale demanded cash from
the teller, Ms Sharon Kerr, she triggered an alarm and slipped a batch
of notes containing an exploding dye pack into the bag.
Seconds after fleeing the bank, dropping money as he ran, red smoke
started pouring out of his carrier bag. A passer-by followed the accused
to a vehicle parked nearby and after a short conversation, Dale, of
Denholm Green, Murray, East Kilbride, agreed to stay where he was until
police arrived.
Mr Gerald Carroll, defending, said work pressures and a gambling
problem had led to a personal crisis for Dale. He had attempted suicide
twice since his arrest.

Dinar, Turkey
HUNDREDS of dazed residents, many clutching tents, wandered through
the streets of a Turkish market town today after a strong earthquake
killed at least 57 people, injured more than 200 and damaged thousands
of homes.
The Anatolian news agency, quoting crisis authorities in Dinar, said
the death toll had reached 57. A government minister has predicted a
final death toll of about 100 from yesterday's quake in the southwestern
town of Dinar.
At least 242 people were injured, the agency said.
The centre of the town, with a population of about 40,000, was scarred
by rubble from apartment blocks and public buildings which collapsed as
if made of sand.
''Our town is gone. Nobody cares,'' exhausted lawyer Adnan Ayturk said
in front of collapsed block of flats where one woman died.
Witnesses said the death toll would have been much higher but many
people had fled their homes last week after minor tremors shook the town
in warning of the big quake.
Minister of Housing and Public Works Halil Culhaoglu was quoted by
Anatolian news agency as saying the authorities ''expect around 100
dead''. The agency said 4000 houses had been destroyed and 1000 damaged.
Scores of homeless people queued for hours at a distribution point
near a damaged secondary school to get Turkish Red Crescent conical
tents thrown from lorries by aid workers.
One woman slumped in a car seat in tears, preparing to spend the
chilly night ahead in the vehicle.
Rescue workers tried to clear the debris of a collapsed five-storey
apartment block in the town centre where several people were believed to
be buried. Pots, pans and other household goods were strewn about the
streets.
''Unfortunately we can't bring back those who have departed but our
heart is here,'' Prime Minister Tansu Ciller told residents. Ciller,
close to tears, had interrupted a 12-day bid to form a new government to
visit Dinar.
Last night's quake measured 6.0 on the Richter scale.
''It was a sudden, very violent tremor,'' said housewife Dondu Ucma,
34. She was taking shelter in a tent, too frightened to return to her
damaged home. ''Everything in the house fell over and broke,'' she said.
Single-storey shanty houses in the outskirts of the town were
relatively undamaged.
President Suleyman Demirel also visited Dinar, situated on a high
plain surrounded by hills in an agricultural region known in Turkey as
the lake district.

Singapore,
A MACABRE trial opened in Singapore today with allegations that
British fugitive John Martin Scripps, suspected of being an
international serial killer, chopped up his victim using butchery skills
he learned in prison.
Scripps, 35, denied the murder of South African tourist Gerard Lowe,
whose remains -- minus the head -- were found in several black plastic
rubbish sacks floating in Singapore harbour.
Using a high-tech giant television screen, pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng
showed the court how Lowe's body had been skilfully cut up after death
by someone with a good knowledge of anatomy or possibly by a person who
had done a similar thing before.
''The person who dismembered this body is knowledgeable, clearly a
very skilful person . . . either a doctor, medical surgeon, veterinary
surgeon or possibly a butcher,'' Chao said.
''When I saw the body, right away I told police we could be dealing
with a serial killer,'' he said.
Prosecutor Jennifer Marie said she would produce more than 20
witnesses during the trial including the man who taught Scripps
butchery.
She said James Quigley, a British prison office caterer, would testify
that ''sometime in 1993, he had taught the accused butchery skills which
the accused had mastered quickly''.
Chao said it was impossible to determine the cause of death because
the head and arms had never been found, but he said it could have been
by a severe blow to the head.
The prosecution then produced a hammer and several knives, found in
Scripps' baggage, which Chao said could have been used to cut up the
body.
If convicted, Scripps faces a mandatory death sentence.
He is alleged to have befriended Lowe, a brewery design engineer from
Johannesburg who arrived on a shopping trip on March 8 at Singapore's
airport, and then checked into a hotel with him to share a room.
Marie told Judge T S Sinnathuray at the High Court that Scripps killed
Lowe in the hotel some time between March 8 and early March 9.
As Marie outlined her case, Scripps, clean-shaven and handcuffed, sat
hunched inside a steel and glass cage in a newly opened courtroom
equipped with a giant television screen to display evidence.
Two policemen flanked him inside the cage and four commandos stood
guard at vantage points outside the courtroom.
After the alleged murder, Scripps flew to Thailand but then returned
to Singapore and was arrested on March 19.
He is also wanted in Thailand, which has since issued arrest warrants
charging him with the murder of two Canadian tourists -- Sheila Damude,
49, a schoolteacher from Victoria, British Columbia, and her son, Darin,
23.
Their dismembered remains were discovered on the island of Phuket in
March. Their passports and some other items were later found in Scripps'
possession after he was arrested in Singapore.
Scripps is also being investigated in connection with unsolved murders
in Mexico and San Francisco. One inquiry links him to the disappearance
of Cambridge graduate Timothy McDowall, 28, and another Briton in
Mexico.
During a break in the proceedings, Scripps' mother and sister were
angered by intrusive photographers and television cameramen. They yanked
at a camera cord and swung their umbrellas to push the journalists away.
Scripps lived in London but his family was from Sandown, Isle of
Wight. He was serving a 13-year sentence in Hertfordshire for heroin
trafficking when he escaped during weekend home leave in October 1994.
Lowe's murder came to light when a torso, thighs severed at the hips,
and legs chopped at the knees were found in black plastic rubbish bags
in Singapore harbour on March 13 and March 16. The head and arms were
never recovered.
Marie, the deputy public prosecutor, said expert witnesses would show
that the body had ''been skilfully disarticulated at the joints''.
She said she also will prove that Scripps used Lowe's credit card and
forged his signature to go ''on a spree of withdrawing monies''.
Edmond Pereira, a top Singapore lawyer appointed by the state to
represent Scripps, has not disclosed what his line of defence will be.
But sources close to the defence said it will try to prove manslaughter,
which is punishable by a maximum of life in prison.
Apparently to pre-empt a possible defence that Scripps killed Lowe to
prevent homosexual advances, the prosecution put Lowe's widow, Vanessa,
on the witness stand. Looking cheerful and well groomed, Mrs Lowe
testified that Lowe, 32, disliked gays.
''We had a healthy sexual life. He was definitely not a homosexual,''
said Mrs Lowe in a written statement that was read out in court while
she sat in the witness chair.--PA.

Washington
A FULL-SCALE security clampdown has been imposed on American airports
in the wake of yesterday's verdict in the New York terror trial.
Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman and nine others were convicted of plotting a
series of attacks in the city in 1993, and the authorities fear
retaliation from Islamic terrorist groups.
The need for security in New York has been doubled by the imminent
arrival of the Pope. He begins his visit here on Wednesday, and will
hold open air masses in New York, New Jersey and Baltimore.
On top of that, the UN is celebrating its 50th anniversary, with a
host of foreign dignitaries coming to the General Assembly, including
Fidel Castro for the first time since 1960. Police in New York say this
is the biggest security challenge they have ever faced.
The jurors who convicted the sheikh and his accomplices are all
anonymous, so the press is not interviewing them.
It is clear the jury believed the prosecution case in its entirety,
and convicted all the accused on almost all counts.

Paris,
A DEFIANT France was again the butt of a wave of global indignation
today after it carried out the second and probably biggest of its new
series of bitterly disputed nuclear weapons tests beneath the South
Pacific.
The fiercest condemnation came from Pacific-rim nations Japan,
Australia and New Zealand, while the United States and Russia, the
world's biggest nuclear powers, also criticised the test, calling it
regrettable.
A majority of European Union foreign ministers also voiced
disappointment, but were at a loss about what to do next. A chorus of
criticism rang out from South Africa to South Korea.
French Prime Minister Alain Juppe shrugged off the protests, vowing
the test programme would go ahead as decided by President Jacques Chirac
in France's ''higher national interest''. The six to eight tests would
be concluded by next May at the latest.
''We are continuing our testing campaign in the conditions and within
the limits set by the president of the republic,'' Juppe said in a brief
statement to reporters.
The French Defence Ministry said the latest blast, with a power of
less than 110 kilotonnes of conventional explosives, was detonated
beneath Fangataufa atoll in French Polynesia.
The explosion, which military sources said was to validate a new
warhead for France's next generation of submarine-launched missiles, was
some five times more powerful than the US atomic bomb dropped on Japan's
Hiroshima in 1945.
Hours earlier, the French navy had captured in international waters a
fourth protest ship sent by the environmental pressure group Greenpeace
to disrupt the test campaign.
While French officials played down the blast as a non-event,
governments around the globe repeated past disapproval.
''The United States regrets this action. We continue to urge all of
the nuclear powers including France to refrain from future tests and to
join in a global moratorium (on testing),'' White House spokesman Mike
McCurry said in a statement.
Paris was not the lone target for criticism. Both Australia and New
Zealand hit out at Britain for refusing to condemn French testing.
After a three-year moratorium on nuclear tests, France's first, far
smaller blast at the Mururoa atoll test site on September 5 unleashed a
tide of world outrage and sparked riots in Tahiti.
This time, Tahiti was calm but tense in the aftermath of the
explosion. But pro-independence groups warned that it could spark a
violent rampage aimed at French expatriates.
More than 800 gendarmes have been deployed in Papeete to quell any
repeat of rioting that followed the first blast.
Japan, Australia and New Zealand all summoned French ambassadors today
to voice opposition to the testing.
Japan's Foreign Minister Yohei Kono told ambassador Jean-Bernard
Ouvrieu he ''strongly regretted that you do not understand Japan's
consistent position on this matter'', and demanded France halt the
testing.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger said in a statement: ''New
Zealanders are outraged that once again France is thumbing its nose at
world opinion.''
Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen said she had hoped the
world reaction would have stopped the tests.
''We are very, very disappointed, but we will not take any further
steps. We will have to explain by words,'' she said before a meeting
with EU counterparts in Luxembourg.
Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg-Petersen, who led the chorus of
EU disapproval of the first test, was dejected. ''I have already
expressed my deep disappointment,'' he said.
In the EU, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain also
condemned the blast. Germany and Austria expressed milder regret.
Britain said it would not be pushed into taking sides in the nuclear
debate. Activists of the environmental pressure group Greenpeace climbed
on to the roof of the French ambassador's residence in London to protest
over the test.
''It is for the French to justify these nuclear tests, but we must
keep our eye on the main strategic objective which is the comprehensive
test ban treaty which will permanently ban all nuclear tests,'' said
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind.
But France vowed to complete its current series of tests to assure its
security.
''France believes her security is based on deterrence. The decision to
resume a limited number of tests over an extremely limited period was
purely to assure French security,'' Foreign Minister Herve de Charette
told a news conference in Luxembourg.
De Charette and Prime Minister Alain Juppe stressed that the tests
were harmless to the environment and would be the last before France
signed a global nuclear weapons test ban.
Military sources said the test was of a TN-75 warhead for France's
next generation of missile-firing submarines. The warheads are to be
fitted onto M-45 missiles to equip four Triomphant-class submarines
which enter service next year.
The 14,000-tonne submarines -- dubbed the ''last resort weapons'' --
are designed to lurk under the sea at distances of over 3600 miles from
their targets.
The test was controversial not only because of its size but because
France's Atomic Energy Commission concluded in its 1994 annual report
that the warhead was ready for service, although it still needed to be
''fully qualified.''--Reuter.

Zagreb
THE United Nations said today it had evidence of a massacre of Serb
civilians in an area of Croatia recaptured by Croatian troops from Serb
rebels, and Zagreb authorities acknowledged the find.
It was the first time the Croatian government had formally
acknowledged a mass killing had taken place in the Krajina region in the
wake of its military victory there in August.
''They (UN monitors) have found evidence of a possible mass killing,''
UN spokesman Chris Gunness told Reuters.
He earlier announced a UN investigation into a report that 12 elderly
Serbs were killed in the village of Varivode near the former Serb
stronghold of Knin last Thursday.
''We have found evidence that something extremely disturbing has taken
place,'' Gunness said. ''But we cannot say much more until the
investigation is completed.''
Croatia's Interior Ministry said police on Friday found the bodies of
nine civilians shot dead in Varivode.
The ministry's statement, carried by the state news agency, gave no
details but said investigations were continuing.
Gunness said UN monitors, who were allowed by the Croatian military to
inspect the site, reported seeing bloodstains on the walls and floor of
several houses in Varivode.
The monitors found bloodstains on the walls and floor at the entrance
to a house where two elderly women, visited by the UN on a previous
occasion, used to live.
In another house they saw a spill of blood on the floor and a bloody
jacket. There was also a bullet hole in the wall with pieces of skin and
hair around it.
In front of another house a 15-yard long trail of blood was found.
Traces of blood were found in another five houses in the village.
Gunness said several pairs of rubber gloves with bloodstains were
found in the vicinity.
The international human rights group Helsinki Watch produced a list of
12 names of villagers, aged between 60 and 85, who were allegedly
massacred last Thursday in Varivode.
The report said their mutilated bodies were later taken by an official
helicopter to Knin and secretly buried. Two other people were missing,
it said.
Journalists and international organisations including the UN have
reported widespread killing, looting and house burning in the area since
Croatian troops seized it in August.
Of some 150,000 Serbs living in the Krajina region before the Croatian
assault, no more than 4500 stayed on, Gunness said. About 60% of the
houses in the southern part of the former Serb-held area were torched.
A Croatian army liaison officer with the UN in Knin said last week
Croatia had arrested 375 people, including policemen and soldiers, on
charges of burning and looting Serb houses.
But in spite of government pledges it was trying to stop the violence,
looting, burning and killing of civilians was continuing, Gunness said.
''Looting has entered a new and very disturbing phase,'' he said.
''Previously it was looting of abandoned houses, now people were being
robbed at gunpoint.''
Gunness quoted a report by an elderly woman from a village near Knin,
who was intimidated by four armed men dressed in military fatigues. They
asked for money and when she said she did not have any, they gunned down
her sheep.
''Either there is a problem with command and control, probably at the
lower level, or there is an amount of complacency,'' he said.

KENYA'S leading dissident Koigi wa Wamwere was sentenced to four years
jail today but he was spared from the gallows after a capital charge was
dropped.
Chief Magistrate William Tuiyot's sentencing perplexed many lawyers
but relieved Koigi's supporters in court who had feared he would be
found guilty of staging an armed raid on a police station in 1993 and
would be given the mandatory death penalty.
''The prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the three
accused committed the crime,'' said Tuiyot. ''I find the first, second
and fourth accused guilty of simple robbery.''
The three, however, were not charged with ''simple robbery'' and
defence lawyers immediately applied for written copies of the judgment
saying they intended to appeal against the verdict.
The trial was closely watched by domestic and international critics of
Kenya's human rights under President Daniel arap Moi and was seen as a
major test for future aid by many donors.
Tuiyot found Koigi, his brother Charles and ex-soldier George Ngengi
guilty of two counts of attempting to steal with violence weapons from
officers at a police station in November 1993.
He sentenced all three to four years' imprisonment on each count to be
served concurrently and six strokes of the cane each but did not refer
to an orginal charge of raiding a police station which carries a
mandatory death sentence on conviction.
''They were charged with attempted robbery and he found them guilty of
simple robbery. We will appeal on the grounds the convictions were not
supported by evidence,'' Paul Muite, Koigi's lawyer and a leading
opposition politician, told Reuters.
''He was working under political pressure. Koigi was not convicted of
a capital charge as they (authorities) speculated this would be wholly
unacceptable to international donors.''
Muite, a member of the opposition Safina party, said John Sutton, a
police reservist and bodyguard of Safina party secretary-general Richard
Leakey, Sutton's assistant and a driver were arrested by police outside
Nakuru law courts.
Muite and Safina officials said Sutton and his assistant were
providing security for them as Leakey was outside Kenya and were not
charged but were taken to an undisclosed location.
Safina, apparently fearing a death sentence for Koigi who is also a
founding member of the party, earlier called for calm in Nakuru and
criticised authorities for charging only three people with whipping and
beating Leakey and journalists in the town in August during an attempt
to visit Koigi in prison.
Safina has been waiting since June to hear whether it will be
officially registered but Moi has said he will never allow Leakey as a
white Kenyan to aspire to political leadership.
Tuiyot acquitted the fourth defendant, Koigi's brother- in-law James
Maigua, on all the charges and acquitted all four on charges of
possessing a homemade handgun and ammunition on the grounds that police
had removed them from the scene.
Lawyers in court said Tuiyot failed to refer to the original main
charge of raiding a police station on the grounds that it was not proved
they had possessed a weapon and ammunition.

COMORO: The military coup leader in the Comoro Islands bluntly told
former colonial ruler France yesterday not to intervene, saying he had
already honoured a promise to hand power to civilians.
A French show of force off the Indian Ocean islands put local troops
on edge four days after the coup, which was spearheaded by about 20
white mercenaries led by French soldier of fortune Bob Denard.
''If France wants to intervene here it would be civil war. We are
ready to die,'' Captain Combo Ayouba, the coup leader, told

LUSAKA: The Zambian government might open criminal proceedings against
former president Kenneth Kaunda, 71, on the grounds that he
''masqueraded'' as a Zambian citizen when he was head of state, a
cabinet minister said yesterday. Kaunda was still a Malawi citizen when
he became president, legal affairs minister Remmy Mushota said. The case
is the latest twist in a growing battle between Kaunda and President
Frederick Chiluba, who ousted the veteran nationalist from power in 1991
elections.

THE leadership yesterday fought off demands for a commitment to
renationalise privatised utilities within the lifetime of the next
Labour government.
Delegates voted by a clear majority on a show of hands to send the
proposal to the party's National Executive for further consideration,
effectively killing it off.
The move came after Dr Jack Cunningham, Shadow Trade and Industry
Secretary, pledged to curb ''excesses'' by the utilities, introduce a
one-off windfall tax on their profits, and bring in a new regulatory
framework.
He told the conference: ''New tough regulation will ensure automatic
consumer rebates and price cuts when profits exceed a fair level.
''Boardroom excesses will not be tolerated. Executive share options
will end in the privatised utilities.''
Dr Cunningham demanded rigorous investigation of merger bids in the
electricity and water industries.
''The Monopolies and Mergers Commission must be used to safeguard the
national and consumer interest. If not, a Labour government will make a
retrospective reference.''
Promising to attack restrictive practices, he said a single
competition and consumer standards office would be set up to give
consumers a new deal.
The call for renationalisation was launched by Electrical and Plumbing
Industries Union official Steve Stevenson. He said privatisation had
become ''a dirty word''.
Returning the utilities to public ownership would cost nothing if a
Labour government redefined their shares and paid interest on them out
of profits, he argued.
Mr Stevenson added: ''What we want from the NEC on this is just a
little bit of socialist radicalism and a bit of creative thinking.''
The call was backed by Christine Shawcroft, of the Co-operative Retail
Society London Political Committee, who said renationalisation of the
utilities could be Labour's ''greatest vote-winner'' and would leave
people ''queuing up'' to vote for the party.

BENEDICT BROGAN reports on an impressive all-round performance.
TONY Blair proved his skill at keeping all sorts of balls -- political
or otherwise -- in the air yesterday during an impromptu training
session with Kevin Keegan, the Labour leader's latest celebrity signing.
At what was supposed to be a routine photo-call, they headed a ball 26
times between them, giving the Labour Party what one official described
as ''the best photo-opportunity we've had yet.''
Mr Blair's feat -- unrehearsed, and without the aid of wires or
spin-doctors -- was put down to hours of playing football in the garden
with his children.
He met Mr Keegan after the Newcastle manager and former Liverpool and
England player addressed a conference fringe meeting on the importance
of football to the national image -- or more specifically, he said, with
apologies to the Scots, the English national image.
Next year's European championships will be the biggest thing to hit
the country since the 1966 World Cup, he told a packed meeting. ''It
will put this country back on the map, not just as a soccer country, but
as a nation.''
Mr Blair was not on hand to hear Mr Keegan set out his social theory
of football: ''Football reflects the social side of this country more
than any other sport. If you pretend that hooligans just come to
football matches to cause trouble for 90 minutes, that's just not true.'
However, victory for England in next year's contest, he said, would
restore the nation's faith in itself. And, he might have added, could
grant Mr Blair the same aura of electoral invincibility claimed by
Harold Wilson and his Labour Government after England's defeat of
Germany in 1966.
Dressed in a loose-cut Labour-red blazer, Mr Keegan appealed for
greater national support for sport, warning that it was not enough to
rely on sponsorship to ensure the success of every sporting event. There
was a limit to the amount of sponsorship available, he said. The state
needed to put money in.
Speaking without notes, he remembered his own European cup days, when
he played with Nobby Stiles -- ''he wasn't dirty, just blind'' -- and
Bobby Moore.
However, he would not be drawn on politics. He evaded questions about
his political affiliation with the finesse of a footballer avoiding a
blind side tackle.
However, he described Mr Blair as ''a breath of fresh air,'' and
added: ''My father was a miner, a strong Labour man. It is in my
blood.''
Explaining his presence in Brighton and his meeting with Mr Blair, he
said; ''I will go anywhere, and I mean anywhere. to talk to people about
football.''
In the conference itself, the first day passed with no signs of past
fireworks. The disruptive extremists of old had been relegated, like the
pale and now passe red roses on either side of the conference stage, to
the very fringes of visibility.
The main speech of the day was given by Shadow Chancellor Gordon
Brown, who delivered most of it standing on his toes. No reason other
than enthusiasm, or perhaps the delicacy of Labour's tax policy, could
be discerned for Mr Brown's tip-toe approach.
The only allusion to it came later, in the minimum wage debate, when
Mr Kumar Sandy, of Welwyn and Hatfield constituency party, complained of
the party's apparent obssession with making ''our policy on tip toe and
our manifesto in carpet slippers.'' Mr Brown was not wearing slippers.

<HEADLINE>Windfall tax on utilities planned to raise money for spending programme. Brown gives #1 bn pledge to tackle youth unemployment</HEADLINE>

SHADOW Chancellor Gordon Brown yesterday gave the first details of a
possible Labour Budget with a promise to halve VAT on fuel, coupled with
a commitment to spend #1 bn on combating youth unemployment.
He accompanied his pledges, which he said would depend on the state of
the economy when Labour took office, with a challenge to Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke to cut VAT on fuel in his November Budget.
He told the Government its tax priority should be to ''cut the tax on
keeping warm for 10 million pensioners and millions of low income
families this winter.''
On unemployment, he warned the Prime Minister: ''If you want to save
money, don't do it by cutting maternity pay or services to the neediest.
Do it by cutting unemployment.''
Labour would use some of the #3 bn raised in its proposed windfall tax
on the profits of privatised utilities to guarantee jobs and training
for 600,000 young people Mr Brown claims would otherwise join the ranks
of the long-term unemployed.
His speech gave the first hint of what Mr Brown would propose in his
first Budget as Chancellor.
However, afterwards he was careful to emphasise that both cutting VAT
and spending money on unemployment were being considered for inclusion
in the party's election manifesto rather than actual commitments.
'We are not going to make spending commitments before we know the
state of the economy,' he told Channel 4 News.
His offer to cut VAT on fuel was the surprise in an otherwise
well-trailed keynote speech to conference. 'The Conservative Party says
it wants to cut taxes in November. If that is their aim, the first cut
they should make -- and I know I speak for the country as a whole --
should be a cut in VAT on fuel,' he said.
''Everyone knows the Conservatives would still like to increase VAT on
fuel from eight to 17.5 percent, to the highest level possible. We would
like to reduce VAT on the lowest level possible. While they want to
double it, we want to halve it.''
His speech set morality as a cornerstone of a Labour government,
promising to ''take moral purpose to the heart of government'' in order
to redress the economics of greed, waste and blind short-termism of the
Tory years.
He attacked excessive profits generated by the privatised utilities,
and repeated his pledge to introduce a windfall levy Duty to raise #3 bn
to fund a training and employment programme. ''The water, gas and
electricity utilities can afford a fair tax on their unfair profits to
give a fair deal to the unemployed,'' he said.
On inflation, he stressed the need for economic stability to protect
those on low and fixed incomes, the traditional victims of inflation.
''That's why no one should doubt that the war against inflation is a
Labour war and an essential part of our battle against insecurity and
unemployment.''
With that came a warning to those on the Labour left advocating higher
taxes, greater spending and more public borrowing. A Labour future, he
said, required the solid foundation of a just and efficient economy:
''We will not build the new Jerusalem on a mountain of debt.''
He added: 'So with a Labour Government there will be no stop go, no
inflationary booms, no massaging the figures, no quick fixes, no blank
cheques, no short cuts, and no pay explosions.'
The policies he pomised to implement included:
* A #75 a week incentive to get the long-term unemployed back to work.
* Allowing local authorities to use housing capital receipts to build
new housing.
* VAT relief for small businesses.
* A University of Industry to revitalise Britain's manufacturing
sector.
However, it was the 600,000 young unemployed that took up the greater
part of his address. 'If this betrayed generation -- the generation of
Thatcher's children, now Major's young forgotten unemployed -- cannot be
rescued from years, perhaps a lifetime of unemployment then the
lifetiime costs of hundreds and thousands of wasted lives will weigh
down our economy and divide our society for another 40 years,' he said.

ONE of the speakers credited with persuading the conference to back
the party leadership over its minimum wage policy yesterday is the
favourite to win selection in the Aberdeen South seat held by Mr Raymond
Robertson, Scottish Education Minister.
Ms Anne Begg, principal teacher of English at Arbroath Academy, is one
of several women participating in the nomination stages of the selection
process for what will be an all-women shortlist.
Although nominations close on November 2, with selection to take place
on November 16, her selection is already being talked of as certain.
Last night a senior source said: ''Obviously we don't want to
anticipate things, but she is the clear favourite.''
Mr Robertson has a vulnerable majority of 1517.
Ms Begg's conference performance has won the approval of the Labour
leadership, both for its loyalty and its success with the delegates. One
Shadow Cabinet member said: ''She is clearly very impressive.''
Ms Begg, who drew applause from the conference for her complaint women
are doing cleaning jobs for a weekly wage that is often less than what
''some spend on a bottle of French wine'', is a member of the
Educational Institute for Scotland and has campaigned for civil rights
and a Scottish Parliament.
She is from Brechin and studied politics at Aberdeen University. Ms
Begg, who is 39, has been confined to a wheelchair for 11 years and
suffers from a blood condition.

THE Labour leadership was yesterday spared a possible defeat in what
would have been a knife-edge vote on setting the figure for a minimum
wage, when activists seeking a guarantee of #4.15 an hour agreed to back
down.
In terms of the warmth of reception from the floor of the conference,
those moving the set figure appeared to be more popular, but Scottish
delegate Jane Saren returned to the rostrum to say that her Edinburgh
Central branch was prepared to accept remitting the issue back for
further consideration.
She told the conference: ''There has been a lot of debate and
discussion about the move to set a figure. There was a lot of pressure
on me and on conference to remit. However, my constituency doesn't bow
to pressure,'' she said, raising the hopes of the left in the hall
before adding: ''But we can be persuaded.
''We are concerned that in putting this composite motion to the vote
we will do a disservice to those we intend to benefit and we cannot let
them down. The Labour Party must deliver.''
Accepting the request to remit the issue to a special policy group let
the party leadership off the hook. This had not seemed likely when the
conference gave one of the most enthusiastic receptions of the day to
the delegate who seconded the motion to set a figure.
Welwyn Hatfield delegate Kumar Sanay attacked the idea that employers
should be consulted before the setting of a minimum wage and claimed
that the minimum wage was a standard-bearer for a host of other social
policies, ''the most vital components against all the social ills --
poverty, crime, and poor education.''
He added, to applause: ''If we do not name our figure, how can we ever
convince traditional Labour voters that we are sincere in our
intentions?''
However, the big guns of the Labour movement were already being
wheeled out in support of the principle being applied without a specific
figure being set.
Transport and General Workers'Union Secretary Bill Morris said a
statutory minimum wage would remove the term working poor from our
vocabulary and as a concept it was ''economically sound, politically
popular, and morally just.''
He said his union, the Labour Party, and most of all the people of
Britain needed a minimum wage but he backed a motion supporting the
principle rather than any specific figure.
There had been conflicting rumours all day about which way the
Communication Workers Union would jump if the issue of a specific wage
was put to the vote. Joint general secretary Alan Johnson argued
forcibly against low pay in Britain but said a TUC seminar in July had
highlighted the complexity of the issue.
''Many of us believe that #4.15 will bear scrutiny as a proper
interpretation of half male median earnings,'' he said.
''But, simply betting on the 4.15 at Brighton is too much of a
gamble.''
Mr Johnson said: ''A failure now to recognise that political and
economic reality will betray the millions of low-paid workers who are
desperate for us to succeed.''
Shadow Employment Secretary Harriet Harman told the conference that
Labour would introduce a national minimum wage to end the scandal of
poverty pay for the first time in our history. She also pledged to
improve job security enforce the right to union membership and tackle
longterm unemployment.
''Fairness and security at work -- these are the foundations of our
radical programme for change,'' she said.
Attacking pay levels as low as #1.20 an hour for security guards, she
said the heads of Burger King could earn #500 an hour, while staff
earned #1 in five hours and she said that it as not only the low paid
who were ripped off, but the taxpayers and good employers too.

SHADOW Home Secretary Jack Straw yesterday was voted off Labour's
ruling National Executive Committee after becoming the latest victim of
the party's women's quota system.
Northern Ireland spokesperson Ms Mo Mowlam was elected in his stead
despite despite polling fewer votes in the constituency section.
Mr Straw was fully expecting to fall foul of the ''assisted places''
scheme which is designed to boost women's representation.
At 58,486, his vote was well up on last year's (50,850) and higher
than the 53,578 attracted by Ms Mowlam and the 45,653 for Hackney North
MP Ms Diane Abbott. However, he lost out under the rule stipulating
there must be at least three women out of the seven CLP seats.
For the same reason, left-winger Ken Livingstone (Brent East) was
again prevented from making a comeback to the NEC, despite an improved
vote of 53,423.
Foreign Affairs spokesman Robin Cook (Livingston) again topped the
section, with Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown (Dunfermline East) moving
ahead of David Blunkett (Sheffield Brightside).
The only other changes of personnel were in the trade union section
where four vacancies were filled by Union of Communications Workers
joint general secretary Alan Johnson, GPMU print union official John
Mitchell, London school dinner lady and GMB member Mary Turner and Isle
of Wight Unison nurse Ms Christine Wilde.
Mr Straw said he had expected the result: ''But I'm delighted that my
vote went up by 8000.
''I'm equally delighted that Mo has come onto the National
Executive,'' he said.
''She is one of my closest friends as well as colleagues in the Shadow
Cabinet. There's no one better to serve on the NEC.''
However, he voiced a hope he might be re-elected next year: ''I'm sad
to be leaving the NEC. I hope it's only a short interlude.''
Mr Straw insisted: ''I supported the move to increase the number of
women on the NEC and I am delighted that Mo is going on the NEC.''
He added most of the votes were cast before he made his recent
controversial speech on law and order, which was felt to have damaged
his standing in the party.
Ms Mowlam, standing beside Mr Straw, said: ''I'm very pleased to have
the chance to be a member of the NEC.
''I'm sad that my mate Jack Straw came off. We're good friends and
good colleagues.
''I'm sad he won't be there, but I'm sure he will play a central role
in campaigning in the party.
''His skills are such that they will be used to the full.''
How they polled
THE results of the NEC elections were:
Union Section -- Dan Duffy, TGWU (3,700,000 votes); Diana Holland,
TGWU (3,685,000); Vernon Hince, RMT (3,685,000); John Mitchell, GPMU
(3,683,000); Mary Turner, GMB (3,659,000); Maggie Jones, Unison

last in elections for the Labour Party National Executive Committee, can
expect even greater humiliation today.
In a move which Labour modernisers will interpret as the death of
''Old Labour'' Mr Scargill will seek to revive Labour's traditional
Clause 4 commitment to wholesale nationalisation that was ditched at
Labour's April special conference by a huge two-thirds majority.
Since then, however, two of the largest party affiliates, Unison and
the Transport and General Workers' Union -- who supported retention of
Clause 4 in April -- have decided that there is no case for re-inventing
it now.
Mr Scargill's support will dwindle to a handful of small
unions,including the Bakers, the Fire Brigades Union, the Rail Maritime
and Transport Union, Aslef, the construction union Ucatt, and very few
others. They will be lucky to amass much more than 5% of the conference
vote between them.
Undaunted, the NUM president will seize the opportunity to restate the
case for the ''common ownership of the means of production, distribution
and exchange.''

LEFT-winger Liz Davies's bid to become an MP appeared set last night
to hit Labour leader Tony Blair's hopes for a ''mood of unity'' at the
conference.
The opening day saw an escalation of the row over the 31-year-old
barrister from Islington who was banned last week by Labour's National
Executive Committee from standing as a the party's parliamentary
candidate for Leeds North-East.
Miners' leader Arthur Scargill warned that the party was becoming so
''manipulative'' its future now was in danger, and urged Ms Davies to
take court action if the NEC did not back down.
Grievances at the NEC's handling of the case will be aired in a
conference debate today.
Labour leader Tony Blair yesterday strongly defended the decision to
veto her selection as a candidate.
Deputy leader John Prescott denied yesterday that there was a
''witch-hunt'' to root out left-wingers who could damage Mr Blair's
chances of winning the next election.
Ms Davies said: ''What is being said is that anybody who criticises
the leader on any particular policy is not fit to be a parliamentary
candidate.''

THE Scottish National Party last night seized on a Labour call for a
reduction in VAT on domestic fuel, claiming it had refused to back just
such a move at Westminster last January.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown told the Labour conference that he
spoke for the country as a whole when he said there should be a cut in
VAT on fuel, an issue which was a real divide between the parties.
However the SNP pounced on this, pointing out that the SNP had moved
an amendment to the Finance Bill last January to cut VAT on fuel to 5%
and Labour had refused to support this. A party spokesman pointed out
that the vote was 283 to seven and only one Scottish Labour MP had
supported the move -- Mr Dennis Canavan -- while the Labour leadership
had dismissed the move as a ''cynical ploy''.
SNP Treasury spokesman John Swinney yesterday claimed Mr Brown had
blundered badly by calling for something that his own party was hostile
to earlier this year.
He said: ''However, it seems that Gordon Brown's statement today does
not add up to the Labour commitment but simply to an aspiration which
they are calling on the Government to implement -- in the full knowledge
that the Government will not.''
He posed the question of when a Labour commitment was really genuine
and asked whether a keynote speech by the Shadow Chancellor amounted to
that. ''People do not trust New Labour and Gordon Brown's hypocrisy over
VAT on fuel is a key example of why.''
Senior Labour Party officials last night poured scorn on the SNP's
claims. One senior party aide said: ''Their  exercise in January
amounted simply to opportunist politics and we are not in the business
of helping that sort of thing. Our call today was about serious
politics.''

TWO women prisoners charged with beating up their warders and escaping
from a van bringing them back from their brother's funeral are asking
for more compassionate leave -- to attend the funeral of another
brother.
Agnes Macdonald, 30, and her sister, Clementine, 25, appeared in
private at Oban Sheriff Court, charged with kicking and biting two
prison officers and escaping from them as they were being taken back to
Holloway prison in London on Friday.
Lawyer David McNeill made no plea or declaration on their behalf but
said later he understood they would be asking prison authorities whether
they could get out again next week to attend the burial of their
brother, Peter, 31, who had been arrested for a ''minor offence'' and
died in the cells at Oban on Saturday.
A post-mortem examination was believed to have been carried out
yesterday but police said there were no suspicious circumstances.
At the same court, James Macdonald, 29, was jailed for 30 days after
admitting a shoplifting charge.
Mr McNeill said James Macdonald had been to the funeral of his
brother, Alistair, and had drunk a lot of whisky.
He did not remember a great deal about the theft but pleaded guilty.
Mr Alister Macdonald had been knocked down by a hit-and-run driver.
Mr McNeill asked Sheriff Colin Mackay not to jail his client, so that
he could go to Peter's funeral.
However, the sheriff refused the application and sent him to jail for
a month.

CASH clerk who embezzled thousands of pounds from the firm where she
worked was jailed for a year yesterday.
Decima Colson defrauded sports turf firm, Souters of Stirling, at a
rate of nearly #1000 a week, Stirling Sheriff Court was told.
About #100,000 went missing between November 1989 and July 1992, when
the embezzlement was discovered.
The court heard the mother of two liked to masquerade as a woman of
substance, carrying a handbag stuffed with #50 notes and showering gifts
on other employees.
Sheriff Brian Murphy told Colson that jail was the only suitable
sentence for her.
He said: ''This was breach of trust on a grand scale and it's
important that employers can trust those who work with cash.''
Colson, 47, of Muirside Road, Tullibody, near Stirling, was originally
accused of embezzling #202,412.
A trial that could have run for up to three weeks was avoided when she
pled guilty to embezzling #100,000.
Souters, set up more than 20 years ago by Braco man John Souter, has
been responsible for the grass at stadiums including Murrayfield,
Hampden Park, Cardiff Arms Park, and Old Trafford.
The court heard the firm had grown to be very successful. However,
depute fiscal Lorraine Glancy, who spent months studying the case, said
its cash control systems had not grown with it.
Between 1979 and 1989, Colson was a model employee, sharing
responsibility for book-keeping with Mr Souter's wife.
However, when Mrs Souter left the business, Colson embarked upon the
systematic deception.
She authorised cheques for petty cash, allegedly to give to Mr Souter,
drew money for non-existent purchases, and ordered building materials
for an extension to her former home through the company books.
The court heard she was caught after colleagues became suspicious and
found a bank bag stuffed with cash in her desk drawer.
Defence agent, Mr George Pollock, said that after her arrest and
immediately before she first was due to appear in March this year,
Colson, now separated from her husband, had taken an overdose and tried
to kill herself.
He said she had blanked out her guilty years and was now under the
care of a psychiatrist. The only explanation he could give was she had
been unhinged by the long illness and death of her father.
The Rev Andrew Dick, minister at St Serf's Parish Church, Tullibody,
said the Church would stand by Colson. He said she had been a respected
member of the Church and taught regularly at the Sunday School until the
early 1980s.

A CONTINUING fall in recorded crime was announced yesterday by Lord
James Douglas-Hamilton, Minister of State at the Scottish Office, but
concern remains high about crimes of violence and murder.
Provisional figures for the first six months of this year showed that
recorded crime was 7% lower than the corresponding period of 1994 -- a
total of 248,915 crimes against 268,720.
Although the total of recorded crimes in Scotland last year, at
527,064, was down from the 542,013 in 1993, serious assaults had risen
to 6705 from 6527 in 1993.
The Scottish Office is not due to publish the number of murders in
1994 until later this month. There were 114 murders in Scotland in 1993,
and 132 in 1992.
Inquiries by The Herald show that Strathclyde Police have investigated
68 murders so far this year. In the whole of 1994, Strathclyde had 70
murders. In 1993 there were 68, and in 1992 the figure was 92.
Lothian and Borders Police have investigated 12 murders so far this
year, compared with seven for the corresponding period last year and 13
in the whole of 1994. All recorded crime was down by 3% so far this
year, and 6% in Edinburgh.
Lord James yesterday welcomed more than 100 men, women, and children
who had helped the police in the past year to a reception at Edinburgh
Castle.
He said the drop in crime figures gave cause for further optimism
after three successive years in which the figures had fallen -- only
0.5% in 1992, then 8% in 1993, and 3% in 1994.
''We know that crime remains a reality for many people and, while we
hope to see more falls in recorded crime, our uncompromising stance
against lawlessness will not falter.
''Those tempted into crime must be deterred by the prospect of
detection, apprehension, and punishment and by the condemnation of the
community as a whole.''
Lord James thanked the 100 guests for their courage and initiative.
Three schoolgirls from Grampian who chased a masked bank robber were
among the recipients of certificates.
They were Katherine More, 14, and Kirsty McGillivray, 14, both pupils
at Elgin Academy, and Kerry McIntosh, 13, a pupil at Lossiemouth High
School.
The girls saw the robber strike a bank employee and steal a briefcase
in Grant Street, Burghead.
They followed him until he disappeared into woods then told the
police. The robber was later jailed for five years.
Also present was Mr David Herkes, 58, whose vigilance led to the
arrest and conviction of Robert Black, now imprisoned for the murders of
Susan Maxwell, Caroline Hogg, and Sarah Harper.
Mr Herkes was working in his garden in Galashiels Road, Stow, when he
saw a six-year-old girl being abducted by the driver of a van. The man
was stopped within 20 minutes and the girl rescued.
Four men who helped the police when Mr David Dunn was shot dead by
bank robbers in Bonnyrigg, Midlothian, last October were thanked.
They were Mr Duncan Milliken, 48, and Mr John Girdler, 49, who tackled
the raiders, and Mr Ronald Allan, 59, and Mr Robert Bourhill, 37, both
security guards, who were attacked.
From Fife came Mrs Margaret Guyan, 62, and her son, Mr William Guyan,
42, a health scientist. They spotted a man robbing a grocery shop in
Kirkcaldy and Mr Guyan chased and caught him.

WHEN the then National Heritage Secretary, Peter Brooke, first
announced details of the National Lottery, he said one of his aims in
redistributing funds was to give something back to the natural world
after centuries of taking from it.
The Millennium Forest bid, first disclosed last August by The Herald,
seemed to fit that bill particularly neatly.
This was a vision prepared by a consortium of conservation,
recreation, woodland, community, training, and employment interests to
return to Scotland the natural woodlands that have been reduced to a
tiny fraction of their original scale because of the last millennium's
legacy of destruction.
Scotland's forests have, over the centuries, been burned for grazing
land, felled for timber, converted to charcoal for smelting, and
over-grazed by cattle, sheep, and deer.
Now, in the five years leading up to the next millennium, a range of
projects across the length and breadth of the country will attempt to
redress the balance.
The key objectives are:
* To extend significantly the cover of native woodlands in Scotland.
* To improve the stewardship of woodlands, enhancing their natural
qualities.
* To increase the cultural, educational, recreational, and economic
value of native woods to the Scottish people.
* To rebuild the social and economic relationship between communities
and their local forests.
Some of the projects which have won funding from phase one are
relatively small, such as the bid to recreate a semi-natural floodplain
forest on extensive wet pasture land in the Bishopbriggs area of
Glasgow.
Wildlife habitats will be enhanced by creating a mixture of
broadleaved woodland, wet meadows, ponds, and marshes. The scheme, led
by a voluntary body Clyde Region Environmental Workers, may also help
flood prevention.
In Edinburgh, as part of Edinburgh District Council's urban forest
strategy, #188,000 has been given to Craigmillar Forest Project -- a
plan to turn the whole of the EH16 postal code area, which takes in the
housing schemes of Craigmillar and Niddrie, into a greener environment.
Money will go towards tree-planting in established green spaces such
as the Jack Kane Park, Jewel Park, and Newcraighall.
On the east shore of Loch Lomond, a native woodland will be created
incorporating Scots pine and oak by the Royal Scottish Forestry Society
with around #1m from the Millennium Commission.
Further north, Forest Enterprise will use the injection of cash to
accelerate its management plan for the Glen Affric and Cannich forest --
one of the few remaining areas of Caledonian Pine Forest.
The Central Scotland Countryside Trust has received funding for three
projects -- two of them to transform urban areas around Airdrie and
Falkirk into woodland, and the third to promote its native woodland
initiative.
In the Borders, the Working with Trees project, chaired by Mr Tim
Stead (who first made a name for himself in Glasgow by designing the
distinctive furniture at Cafe Gandolfi) aims to produce a centre of
excellence to provide training for young people, to create markets for
woodland products, and to provide a link between the people who make
things with wood and those who grow timber.

THE first phase of an ambitious plan to reforest huge areas of
Scotland, from the native Caledonian pine forests of the Highland glens
to the former industrial wastelands of Lanarkshire, has been awarded a
Millennium Commission grant of #5.75m towards an #11.5m project.
The award to the Millennium Forest of Scotland (MFS) Initiative -- a
consortium of leading conservation, training, recreation, and community
organisations -- will go towards the setting up of an umbrella
organisation, the MFS Trust, and part fund 45 projects in the first
phase of the application.
The Millennium Commission's approval of the principle of the entire
five-year application means that future applications for further
tranches of money are likely to be considered favourites in future
rounds of bids.
If over the next five years the MFS initiative achieves its ultimate
goal of receiving funding for all the projects under its umbrella, the
Millennium Commission could pay out as much as #50m to fund #100m worth
of regeneration, planting, and forestry-related projects.
This would make the Millennium Forest award among the biggest to come
to Scotland -- equal to the World Centre for the Earth at Conisbrough,
near Doncaster, which received #50m from the commission yesterday, and
the regeneration of Portsmouth harbour, which received #40m.
Under the first stage of the Millennium Forest plan, woodland sites
covering 64 square miles throughout Scotland will receive funding. Half
will become new woodland and half will be regenerated and reclaimed from
existing areas. Central to the proposal is the aim to replant native
broadleaf and conifer species which have, over the centuries, been
reduced to a fraction of their former glory.
Supporters said yesterday that the plan to regenerate bluebell oak
woods and mountain woodland ''shimmering with native birch'' had drawn
widespread support.
Mrs Barbara Kelly, chairwoman of the MFS Initiative, said: ''I am
beginning to understand what it must feel like to be a jackpot winner in
the lottery. I can say quite clearly and honestly that everyone in
Scotland is a lottery winner here, because everyone can benefit from the
projects that are being put together.''
Mr Simon Pepper, chairman of the initiative's steering group
committee, said 96% of Scotland's native woodland resource had been lost
and it was still going down. ''Everyone is the poorer for that -- the
people, the environment, and the economy of Scotland.''
Commission chairman Virginia Bottomley said the benefits of the
Millennium Forest initiative would be enjoyed by generations to come.
The project might even live to see the fourth millennium, she said.
Miss Heather Wilkinson, deputy chief executive of the Millennium
Commission, said the commission was particularly impressed by the
involvement of so many communities and people working at grass-roots
level.
''This is a project that has not been imposed from on high. We are not
interested in projects that the great and the good have dreamt up and
then gone along and presented to the local community as a good thing,''
she said.
The Millennium Commission yesterday opened its second round of
applications for funding and expects to have about #350m to distribute
next year.

BLINKING in unaccustomed daylight, jazz yesterday emerged from its
late night, smoke-laden world into the respectability of academe, with
the launch of the National Jazz Institute of Scotland, the country's
first accredited jazz course.
It will be based at the department of applied arts on the Jordanhill
campus of the University of Strathclyde.
The course will offer training to musicians irrespective of their age
or academic qualifications. Entry will be by audition and the only
requirement will be ability.
The part-time course, beginning in January, will be led by saxophonist
Tommy Smith and the director of Strathclyde Youth Jazz Orchestra, Bobby
Wishart.
Smith said: ''This is a wonderful opportunity for aspiring musicians.
People will have the courage to apply for this because they don't have
to qualify academically.''
He had already received 15 audition cassettes from musicians between
the ages of 14 and 42. ''The standard, on first reaction, is much better
than I had expected.''
Initial financial support for the development of the course, which is
expected to cost around #100,000 a year, has been given by Glasgow
Development Agency and Glasgow District Council.
The course will be fee-paying (#480 a year) and a number of bursaries
will be available. It is understood that the Scottish Arts Council has
indicated an interest in the provision of bursaries.
The curriculum of the National Jazz Institute will be modelled to a
degree on the famed jazz course at Berklee College in Boston. It will
offer tuition in fundamentals including ear-training, harmony,
arranging, history, and jazz piano.
Michael Tumelty's feature on the National Jazz Institute will appear
on the Arts Page in tomorrow's Herald.

A MARRIED company vice-president yesterday admitted to an industrial
tribunal that he had had affairs with two women employees.
He claimed the liaisons were ''howling'' mistakes, although he
admitted to still missing one of them.
Both women blame him for having to leave their jobs after the affairs
ended.
Mrs Jennifer McMillan, of Chapelhill Mount, Ardrossan, claims she was
constructively dismissed, as senior supervisor, from Saztec Europe Ltd,
North Crescent Road, Ardrossan, on November 15 last year after her
affair with Mr Michael Dale finished.
At the time, Mr Dale, 51, who is now vice-president and general
manager of Saztec Europe, was the deputy general manager of the American
company. Mr Dale, who is married with two daughters, lives near
Farnborough, Hampshire.
Before beginning his affair with Mrs McMillan, Mr Dale had an affair
with Miss Ruth Donnachie, who was Saztec's production manager designate.
Miss Donnachie, who was made redundant after her affair with Mr Dale
ended, told the tribunal that they became intimate while in the
Philippines on a business trip in July 1992.
She said she did not want the affair to continue on her return to
Scotland but they had an on-off relationship until March 1994, when she
told Mr Dale she was seeing someone else.
Asked how he reacted, she said: ''He said I was an evil bitch, that I
was pure poison, and that I would regret everything.
''He said he was going to hurt me more than I ever knew. I said, 'what
can you do to me, you can only sack me'. He said, 'I can do more than
that'.
''The week after that, my sister, who was the personnel manager was
sacked.''
Miss Donnachie, 29, said that when she was made redundant in May 1994
she was expecting it.
Mr Dale, in evidence, admitted to having affairs with both women and
said he became intimate with Mrs McMillan ''around the beginning of May
last year''.
Asked why it ended, he replied: ''Like a lot of relationships, it went
sour.''
Then, asked if he had made a mistake in getting involved with fellow
workers, he added: ''We all make mistakes and I made two howling
mistakes.''
Asked if company president Guy Abernathy had spoken to him about the
situation, Mr Dale added: ''I was warned it was a very, very stupid
thing and I wasn't to do it again.''
Asked if he had anything to do with Mrs McMillan's departure, Mr Dale
said: 'Absolutely nothing.''
Asked whether he was involved in Miss Donnachie's redundancy, he
replied: ''Yes.'' He explained that the company needed to save money
because of a drop in work but he denied that his relationship with Miss
Donnachie affected his decision.
He also confirmed that he was involved in the dismissal of Miss
Donnachie's sister and said she ''was surplus to requirements''.
Asked about his feelings for Miss Donnachie, he said: ''I still miss
her to this day.''
Mrs McMillan, who was represented by her father Peter Monaghan, said
when she returned to work after being off work through stress, following
the end of her affair with Mr Dale, she felt ''rejected and isolated''.
She said that when she went back to work on October 10 last year, she
had no desk or office, personal belongings were missing and she faced a
drop in salary.
When she asked Ms Ann Barlow, the company's general manager, what was
happening, she was told: ''Jenny, I do not have time for this. I have
too many other problems.''
She said there was no reason given by Mr Dale for their affair coming
to an end.
The tribunal continues next month.

THE Old Firm are in talks over fans' safety because both sets of
football supporters will be on the Continent at the same time later this
month.
Their paths are most likely to cross at Channel ports, with the
possibility of Rangers and Celtic fans being on the same ferries.
Celtic supporters will head for France after being drawn against Paris
Saint-Germain in the European Cup-winner's Cup with the first leg,
second round match at Parc des Princes on Thursday, October 19.
Just 24 hours earlier, Rangers will play Italian club Juventus in the
European Champions' Cup at the Stadio Delle Alpi, Turin.
A Celtic spokesman said yesterday: ''We are in discussion with Rangers
and the appropriate authorities to ensure the comfort and safety of all
parties.''

MOTORISTS are being offered free vehicle checks to encourage them to
gear up for a safe winter's driving.
However, should they fail to take the opportunity, they could be
caught in a police crackdown on illegal tyres.
From Thursday until Sunday, AA and RAC experts will be available at
some Safeway car parks around Scotland to offer free checks on tyres and
lights.
The enforcement phase of the 1995 Winter Safety campaign will begin
next Monday, when Scottish police forces will start random roadside
inspections.
Launching the campaign yesterday at Strathclyde police headquarters in
Glasgow, Assistant Chief Constable Ian Mackinnon said: ''The main
purpose is to make sure that people's vehicles are both safe and
reliable to run on the road.
''With free checks being provided by the motoring organisations
throughout the country, drivers now have no excuse not to have their
vehicle given the once-over by professionals. Those people who continue
to drive on illegal tyres will, when detected, suffer the
consequences.''
However, Mr Mackinnon said the police would be taking a reasonable
approach to drivers caught with poor tyres. Apart from particularly bad
cases, motorists would be given the opportunity to have them replaced
rather than face prosecution.

<HEADLINE>Halifax settles case with widow who lost home</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976077083</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A WIDOW has received #33,493 in settlement of a damages claim brought
against the Halifax Building Society and her solicitors after losing her
home.
Mother-of-eight Mrs Patricia Gifford described later how she had
''gone through hell'' fighting for justice.
Mrs Gifford, 58, now living with a friend at Seven Sisters Road,
Enfield, north London, told the High Court she and her farm worker
husband Roy bought their council house in 1988.
The Halifax gave Mr and Mrs Gifford a 100% mortgage on 1 Ramsey
Cottage, Great Henny, near Sudbury, Suffolk, a property with a market
value of #46,000 offered to them for #22,540 by Braintree District
Council.
They both believed that they had been sold an endowment mortgage with
proper insurance cover, said Mrs Gifford.
It was not until her husband died aged 59 of a heart attack in March
1989 that Mrs Gifford, a craft worker, discovered they had been sold an
''interest only retirement scheme'' without the protection of life
insurance.
She said: ''My husband and I believed we had been sold an endowment
mortgage I was stunned when I found out that was not the case.''
She remortgaged the house to pay off the Halifax but could not keep up
instalments and in March 1992 the house was repossessed.
Mrs Gifford launched her claim for damages against the Halifax for
allegedly selling her a mortgage package which she said was clearly
unsuitable.
She also sued solicitors Steed and Steed, of Sudbury, Suffolk,
alleging they had given negligent advice over the purchase.
Yesterday both the building society and the solicitors emphatically
denied liability or that there had been any negligence on their part.
Mr Malcolm Waters, for the Halifax, told the judge the society was
''very pleased'' to agree a compromise over Mrs Gifford's claim.
He said: ''The terms of settlement don't involve any admission of
liability.''
They provided ''a sensible commercial basis'' to settle bearing in
mind that Mrs Gifford was fighting her case on legal aid and the society
could not expect to recover its legal costs even if it were successful
at a full trial.
Mr Mark Cannon, appearing for Steed and Steed, said the settlement was
made on the basis of no admission of liability.
Approving the settlement, Judge Orde said he was glad that the two
sides had come to terms.

<RECORDNO>976077084</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
MORE than 50 people have applied for the top financial post on an NHS
trust embroiled in a cash crisis.
Highland Communities NHS Trust last week revealed they were #1.8m in
the red following accounting blunders.
It is planning to shed up to 45 jobs and shut down a geriatric ward at
the Royal Northern Infirmary, Inverness, to help make up the deficit.
Former finance chief Alastair Christie was sacked in August when the
trust upheld claims of staff harrassment.
Trust secretary Chris Meecham said yesterday the number of
applications was surprising considering the position of the trust.
He said applicants would be attracted by the high responsibility such
a job offers, as well as the #40,000 salary.
The applicants are being shortlisted and interviews will take place
soon for the post, said Mr Meecham.
Meanwhile, the trust has announced the appointment of an accountant as
a non-executive member on the board.
Former Highland Regional Council finance director James Bremner said:
''I look forward to making a positive contribution in this challenging
role.''
Trust chairman Donald John Mackay said: ''His financial expertise will
be a positive asset.''
Trust board secretary Chris Meecham said the appointment was not
connected to the cash crisis facing the trust.
He added: ''We always like to have an accountant on the board.''

CHILDREN from nurseries through to secondary schools are to learn of
the dangers of drugs in a new Government health drive.
Youngsters aged between three and 18 will benefit from the overall
package, designed to lay the foundations for improving Scotland's future
health.
Launching three different initiatives -- Drugwise First for primary
schoolchildren, Drugwise -- Drug Free for 14 to 18-year-olds, and the
Health Education for Living (Help) project for nursery to S6 youngsters
-- Scottish Education Minister Raymond Robertson stressed it was vital
to hammer home the anti-drugs message.
''Drugs kill. Anything we can do to stop Scottish young people from
getting involved in this and ending up destroying their lives has to be
worth it,'' he declared.
However, he stressed the programmes for nursery and primary school
children would be handled sensitively.
''A balance has to be struck as to when you introduce concerns about
drug taking and drugs misuse but we have got to face up to the fact that
drugs misuse is one of the evils that is facing Scotland,'' he said.
A hard-hitting video warning of the social and legal cost of dabbling
with drugs will be used in the programme for the 14 to 18 age group.
The initiative fulfils one of the recommendations made by the
ministerial Drugs Task Force, which reported in October 1994.
Speaking at the launch in Edinburgh, Mr Robertson also expressed his
condolences to the family of 12-year-old Borders schoolboy Alistair
Lambert, who was found dead at his home after being suspended from
Peebles High School amid allegations of drugs possession.
However, he said there were no plans to introduce a central policy for
schools on how they handled drugs incidents.
''The policy of exclusion is a matter for the education authorities.
Borders policy is in line with virtually every other education authority
in Scotland,'' he said.
Drugs have cost 78 lives across Scotland this year. No central figures
are kept for drugs incidents in schools, but there are estimated to be
around 100 each year at secondary schools, said Mr Alistair Ramsay, of
Strathclyde region, leader of the team which has developed the Help
programme.
He said primary schools were still thought to be relatively untouched
by the problem but a growing awareness of the drug culture among
youngsters had prompted the new drive.
Mr Ramsay said the use of former addicts in the education programme
had been dropped after the addicts themselves had told a Government
Select Committee looking at the issue that the wrong message could be
given and because of fears the addicts could become role models for
youngsters. Mr Ramsay said such volunteers and voluntary groups had a
different role to play in the war on drugs.
''Children spend only one-ninth of their time in school and
eight-ninths elsewhere. There is only so much the school can do. There
is a great need for the eight-ninths of that time to be addressed.''
Welcoming the initiative, Mr David Liddell, director of the Scottish
Drugs Forum, said: ''This will make drug education more widely available
within the school system.''

GENTEEL Winchester, the cathedral town nestling in the Hampshire Downs
where Jane Austen is buried, has geared itself for what is likely to be
one of the most macabre and grisly criminal trials heard in any court.
Today, a jury will be selected to try the House of Horror case and
psychiatrists are on hand to offer counselling.
Mrs Rosemary West, wife of Frederick West, who took his own life in
prison, is accused of 10 murders. She denies each charge.
Her husband would have been accused of two other killings.
One of the murders Mrs West is alleged to have committed is that of
Scots-born Charmaine Costello, daughter of Fred West's first wife.
Today, a jury will be selected from a panel of 70. The team of
counsellors is standing by to offer any assistance that might be
required to any member.
The jury will hear evidence in a courtroom that over the next eight
weeks or so will be the centre of worldwide media attention.
Demand for press seats in court has been such that officials have set
up audio links into two annexes.
Requests for places have come from countries as far afield as Japan
and France. However, only 30 journalists have been accredited places in
the courtroom itself.
The Herald is the only Scottish media organisation that has a seat in
court. Other Scottish newspapers will have to satisfy readers' demands
from reports gleaned over the audio link to the annexes or from news
agencies.
Court No 3 is an extraordinarily modern courtroom for a town which has
been the centre of infamous trials since ancient times.
The trial judge, Mr Justice Mantell, will sit under a canopy on a
high-backed red chair overlooking counsel in front of him and the press
to his left and right.
Directly opposite the judge in the dock, Mrs West, a somewhat dumpy,
middle-aged, bespectacled woman, will sit between two prison officers.
Those sitting in the public gallery above will have no view of the
accused.
Proceedings when they get under way this morning will rely heavily on
the latest hi-tech computers.
Counsel for the prosecution and the defence each will have before them
two laptops giving immediate transcriptions of what is said in court.
The judge, too, will have a laptop. He will also be able to oversee
information going to the press in his ''courtroom annexes''.
The software being introduced during this trial is an update on
systems used in the O J Simpson trial and that currently being used in
the Maxwell brothers' trial in London.
In the Winchester court, several microphones have been placed in front
of the witness box to accommodate feeds to the main courtroom, the
annexes, and the note-takers.
Yesterday, Winchester was beginning to get a first feel of what it
will be like to be at the centre of worldwide media attention as
television crews and journalists roamed the town.
According to the local Chamber of Commerce, it is reckoned the trial
could earn the town an additional #500,000 during a quiet season.
Optimists put the figure as high as #1m.
Following jury selection, if this case follows the precedent of other
infamous trials, there is likely to be a delay of some days before
anything further is said before the jury.
Certainly the court will not sit tomorrow. The prosecuting counsel, Mr
Brian Levesen, QC, is Jewish and he will be observing Yom Kippur.

A BUSINESS ended after 50 years yesterday with the clearing of a desk
and the sending out of letters thanking customers for their loyalty. It
was a sad occasion for Jim Hamilton, president of Hamilton Dairies.
He recently decided to sell the family-run dairy to a competitor and
personal friend, Robert Wiseman. He feels that the milk production
industry has become one dictated by supermarket chains, leaving no room
for small ''provincial'' players.
He found it difficult to relinquish a business which was now the third
largest dairy company in Scotland, with a #30m turnover. It had been
built up from scratch, employing many friends.
The plant at East Kilbride has a staff of 330.
There had, he said, never been a strike: ''We have never had a union
here because the conditions are better than those suggested by any
union. People here know they can talk to Jim upstairs.''
Mr Hamilton says he has always had a good feel for the market. He
endeavoured to keep abreast of changing trends, such as supermarket
demands for plastic packaging.
He left school at 14 when his father died, aged 50, and worked with
the family's 60-strong dairy herd at the Mains. When part of the farm on
the fringes of the town was sold to Rolls-Royce, Mr Hamilton took to
rising before dawn and selling milk round the doors of East Kilbride.
The business grew and the Mains Farm dairy expanded to employ around
60 people. Then, in 1981, the company moved to a #2m plant. Production
has since risen from around 10,000 gallons a day to 40,000 gallons.
Mr Hamilton says his career has been marked by highs rather than lows
and he is hard pressed to remember any particular disasters. Instead, he
dwells on the tremendous sense of comradeship among his managers, the
late nights round the pool table solving problems, and the support from
his wife, Babs.
He attributes his initiative to his father who he says was ahead of
the dairy game in the 1940s, running 10 shops in Glasgow and a bakery.
The journey from milk boy to company president has, in addition to
material success, seen Mr Hamilton become an establishment figure in
East Kilbride. He has been heavily involved with the town's development
corporation and has served as a justice of the peace and as a deputy
lieutenant of Lanarkshire. As a tribute, the development corporation
will landscape a #3m park in sight of the dairies called the James
Hamilton Heritage Park.
An hour before clocking out time last night, Mr Hamilton took down
framed photographs of himself and various dignitaries from his office
wall, cleared his desk, and fielded calls from well-wishers.
Retirement, he admitted, had loomed large since negotiations with
Wiseman Dairies got under way in January. Faced with the reality, his
reputed sense of humour deserted him. He said he hoped there would be no
redundancies as a consequence of the takeover.
''We didn't want to open a plant in Manchester like Wiseman's, that
was never our game. I'm a Scottish nationalist and I suppose I just find
it sad that this is the way the business has gone.''

GREATER use of tranquilisers may be necessary to ease withdrawal
symptoms of prisoners coming off drugs and reduce the risk of suicides,
a team of psychiatrists said yesterday.
A survey they carried out of Scotland's prison remand population
showed that nearly three-quarters of them had previously taken illicit
drugs.
A quarter of them admitted to continuing drug use in prison, mostly
cannabis but including opiates in 8% of cases.
The study, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, was funded
by the Scottish Home and Health Department and took place last year.
Dr Mark Davidson and his colleagues from the Royal Edinburgh Hospital
said the prisoners they interviewed often admitted previous
non-accidental self-injury which, coupled with high rates of alcohol and
drug abuse, might reflect predominant personality traits and, in some
cases, personality disorder.
''The extent of drug-taking and the frequency of symptoms likely to be
related to withdrawal suggest that detoxification regimes should be
employed more frequently,'' said the doctors.
''This might involve an increase in the amount of benzodiazepines and
other drugs prescribed in prison but, with appropriate control, it would
reduce serious withdrawal effects and also symptoms of depression and
anxiety associated with self harm, a constant and continuing cause for
concern.''

THE UK's 4000-man 24 Airmobile Brigade is to be pulled out of the
former Yugoslavia within the next four weeks after being beaten into
submission by a barrage of red tape.
The unit, deployed two months ago with 39 transport and gunship
helicopters to provide rapid protection for UN peacekeepers in the safe
havens, has been confined to a makeshift camp near Ploce on the Croatian
coast ever since.
Croat authorities have consistently refused to grant permission for
realistic field training or for deployment across the border into
Bosnia, turning the British Army's most mobile formation into its most
immobile.
Morale among the men of the brigade has plummeted in recent weeks as
heavy rains and the first cold snaps of winter turned their temporary
accommodation area into a quagmire. Conditions are so bad that
journalists have been refused permission to visit the site.
A military source said last night: ''The Ploce camp is little more
than a swamp. Morale has nose-dived as a result both of the conditions
and the complete impasse with the Croats. The men had been looking
forward to putting their training into practice. Instead, they have been
little more than prisoners with few outlets for their energies.''
UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is currently reviewing
troop levels, and it is understood that he will give swift permission
for the withdrawal of the brigade to relieve its plight.
UN commanders in Sarajevo believe the job of protecting peacekeepers
can be carried out by the tri-national UK, French and Dutch armoured
brigade already operating in Bosnia. The guns and mortars of this force
are dug in on Mount Igman to guarantee Serb compliance with the 12-mile
exclusion zone around the Bosnian capital.
It is believed the Croats blocked all attempts to move the
highly-effective British airmobile brigade into Bosnia to allow freedom
of action for their own and allied Muslim forces. The federation armies
recaptured 1500 square miles of Serb-held territory in a series of late
summer lightning offensives.

<RECORDNO>976077102</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth has turned down a request to hold a
public inquiry into the operation of a now-disused waste shaft at
Dounreay.
The shaft -- the scene of an explosion in 1977 -- has been linked with
radioactive ''hot-spots'' found around the site and the near-by
foreshore.
Caithness Against Nuclear Dumping had called for an inquiry to
establish the contents of the 65-metre deep shaft.
The protest group wanted any worker or former worker who gave evidence
to be promised immunity from prosecution under the Official Secrets Act.
But CAND has been told Mr Forsyth thinks an inquiry would be too
costly and would not serve a useful purpose.
In a letter, a spokesman for the Scottish Secretary says details of
the internal investigation into the explosion have been passed to
nuclear regulatory and advisory bodies.
The UK Atomic Energy Authority's records of the contents of the shaft,
he adds, have been found to comply with disposal consents.
Dounreay's operators are meantime developing options to decommission
the shaft.
CAND secretary Mrs Marjory Mackenzie said the reply was not
unexpected.
Despite the setback, she said CAND would be continuing to try to
penetrate the official veil of secrecy she claims surrounds the shaft.
''We know that a lot of stuff was thrown down the shaft willy-nilly
just because it was convenient,'' said Mrs Mackenzie.
''We believe the public should be told exactly what is down there and
also be told the detailed circumstances of the explosion.''
Mrs Mackenzie said CAND was particularly keen to free the workforce
from the provisions of the Official Secrets Act.
She said: ''If Dounreay really have nothing to hide, surely they would
be quite happy if their workers could speak out publicly.''
The Scottish Office and the UKAEA have repeatedly rebuffed requests to
publish the internal report into the explosion.

THEY pride themselves on not making a drama out of a crisis. However,
according to a Scottish advocate, Commercial Union has instead turned a
drama into a nightmare.
It is now seven years since advocate Dick Anderson's flat was
destroyed by fire which gutted his Edinburgh tenement. Since that date,
Mr Anderson, who was fully covered, has been locked in a heated wrangle
with the CU over repairing the damage.
While he was in the fortunate position of not having a mortgage on the
#45,000 flat in Nicolson Square, Mr Anderson has had to pay #500 a month
for six-and-a-half years to rent another flat after the initial six
months' insurance cover ran out.
Such has been his anger with the way he has been treated, he has taken
the unique step of seeking a ruling from the Court of Session in
Edinburgh. The hearing is set for December 1.
Should Mr Anderson fail to win his case, the outcome will, he
believes, have enormous ramifications for people who insure tenement
flats.
The fire broke out early on Sunday, October 8, 1988. He said: ''My
whole hall was a sheet of flames. I leaned out the bedroom window
shouting for help. I got a handy object and broke a neighbour's window
to alert him. He then phoned the fire brigade.''
As the blaze engulfed the flat, two firemen with breathing apparatus
managed to lead him to safety.
Mr Anderson said: ''The CU has paid out on the contents quite happily
but has been extremely unreasonable when it came to settle the building
insurance.''
Modern building contracts are invariably estimates (called tenders)
and payment is made on interim certificates leading to a final account.
The CU in Mr Anderson's case has only ever offered the first tender
sum. If he accepted that and signed a discharge, he would be liable for
any difference between tender and final sum.
This is particularly significant because a one-foot-square wooden beam
that was inspected by structural engineers after the fire was reckoned
to have a 50-50 chance of being saved. However, the tender was submitted
on the basis that it would be saved.
Mr Anderson said: ''If it could not be saved, I could face a bill for
between #6000 and #10,000. This is the crux of the matter.
''If that beam collapsed or a surveyor passed it unfit at a later
stage and it devalued the property, a judge would say that I had the
remedy in my own hands at the time.''
The CU, Mr Anderson claims, is adamant that it only has to offer the
tender sum. ''I say it is a contract of indemnity and that the true cost
of repair is the final account including the eventual cost of that
beam.''
In a historic move, Mr Anderson has gone to the Court of Session to
ask it to declare the insurance company's true obligations under their
''Golden Key'' policy of insurance.
This is called an Action of Declarator. The Herald can report this
because the action has progressed to the stage where the Record is
closed.
Mr Anderson said: ''The case is set down for hearing on December 1.
The outcome has enormous ramifications for tenement dwellers. The repair
of a whole tenement is likely to be of such a size that it would have to
be overseen by a surveyor and have one of the standard form building
contracts which involves interim certificates.''
He added: ''The whole thing has been a nightmare. I have incurred
expenditure of #500 a month in renting a flat that I would not otherwise
have spent. That works out at #39,000 over the period.
''The worst aspect is the social one. I lived in the flat for 10 years
and was well settled with an enjoyable social life which has been
totally disrupted since the fire took place.
''My expert says it is a ludicrous situation. He can't understand the
position the CU is adopting here, which is that they will only pay out
the estimated cost, not the final cost.''
Another of Mr Anderson's complaints is that despite insuring the whole
tenement, the CU made no effort to repair the tenement as a whole.
Mr Anderson said: ''If I win, it will establish the principle that the
words 'cost of repairs' in your policy means the final account for work
related to the fire.''
A Commercial Union spokesman said last night: ''It is a very complex
matter.
''We have never disputed liability in the claim. In March 1989, we
agreed in principle to pay the then estimated costs for the work to be
carried out. The work has never happened and this is for reasons outside
our control.''

AN influential Scottish churchman has written to the Prime Minister
expressing concern at the continuing erosion of job security in Scotland
and has warned of its detrimental effect on society.
Secretary of the ecumenical Scottish Churches Industrial Mission, the
Rev Hugh Ormiston has sent a letter to Downing Street highlighting
concerns at the increased use of part-time working, zero hours
contracts, derecognition of trade unions and ''the continuing downward
pressure on the wages of the poorest paid''.
Driving down wages is also increasing the burden on the public, as the
low-paid are encouraged to claim state benefits to top up their income,
he said.
Dr Ormiston also writes that while in the short term these practices
may allow companies to compete more effectively, there is a high price
to be paid both economically and socially.
He warns: ''The loss of job security is bound to have far-reaching
effects on home ownership and the promotion of the black economy with
its effect on the national taxation system.
''Long hours of overtime, no holiday pay and job uncertainty are set
to have a detrimental effect on homes, marriages and the upbringing of
children, as well as inducing unnecessarily high levels of stress in the
adult population.
''Our fear is that, in the long term, job uncertainty etc is bound to
lead to anti-social behaviour through substance abuse and crime.''
The letter calls on Mr Major to consider a widespread review of
working practices to preserve the social fabric of the country.
Speaking in Edinburgh yesterday, Dr Ormiston said the letter had been
written amid general concern about the loss of job security expressed
throughout the churches.
''We think what's needed is a widespread discussion in order to
protect the conditions and living standards of Europe, which have been
struggled over for decades, and at the same time to try to encourage our
compatriots to restore these.''
He claimed the trend to drive down wages had left Britain as a ''low
wage economy'' in Europe, on a par with traditional low-paid countries
such as Portugal, Spain and Greece, and had also led to a widening of
the poverty gap between rich and poor, driving Britain back into
Victorian times.
''We share the working conditions of the British Isles which, thanks
to successive governments, have pushed us down the league of wages. We
are effectively a low wage economy. At the same time, we have suffered
the polarising of wages so that polarisation is now at its greatest
since about the 1880s.''
The Church of Scotland chaplain said it was vital to have public
debate on the issue, before Britain became a divided nation of rich and
poor.

<HEADLINE>Medical staff blame Government underfunding as hospital trust faces a #2m deficit. Doctors fear threat to patient care</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>GRAEME SMITH</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976077106</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SENIOR medical staff last night blamed Government underfunding for the
#2m deficit faced by Aberdeen Royal Hospitals Trust.
They also warned that patient care would be affected if the funding
was not increased. They claimed they were victims of their own
efficiency because they could not make the cuts less thrifty trusts were
making.
Dr Chris Smith, a consultant physician and chairman of the area
committee of physicians, said they should not be turned into ''barefoot
doctors in Bangladesh'' but should be properly funded to operate as
high-quality British doctors.
Their defence of the trust's management came almost a week after it
was first revealed that trust was in financial difficulties.
A letter from the NHS Scottish executive had questioned the role of
the trust's financial director and it was subsequently revealed he had
resigned from next March because of changes which would have restricted
his role.
Mr Alex Cumming, who took over as chief executive of Scotland's first
trust a year ago, held a news conference yesterday but would not become
involved in politics. He said: ''I have a responsibility to ensure the
trust's affairs are properly managed. I accept that responsibility and
don't wish to pass it anywhere else.''
However, he was vigorously defended.
Dr Smith said not enough money was being received from the Scottish
Office.
''I think we are in a situation of rationing and if the funding is not
appropriately dealt with in the foreseeable future, patients will not be
given high- quality care and rationing will occur. We have to face this
head on and the population of Aberdeen and North-east Scotland need to
be aware of it.
''We have had closure of our wards, including my own, on and off since
the summer and it has been a very difficult time for the medical and
nursing staff and the patients.
''We have been looking after patients on two floors. The nursing teams
have been divided but in spite of that we have turned no-one away.''
He said there was the potential for premature discharge of patients
and added: ''Thank God we have not had any disasters of any sort because
of caution on behalf of the medical and nursing team.''
He added: ''On behalf of the physicians and all the sub-disciplines
within medicine which I represent, I would like to make the point we
have total and complete confidence in Mr Cumming and we have written to
him and indicated that.''
Mr John McKinnon, chairman of the joint staff consultative and
negotiating comittee, said: ''The vast majority of my colleagues are of
the opinion that it is Government underfunding which has caused this
problem and not mismanagement in the trust. The whole National Health
Service is underfunded and this trust is suffering as a result of
that.''
He said costs were about 18% lower than many other teaching hospitals
in Scotland and any efficiency savings were hard to achieve.
Mr Cumming, who made it clear it was his job which would be on the
line if there was any mismanagement, said: ''There is no crisis. We have
consistently made clear our position to the purchasers, the management
executive, and indeed our staff over the past nine months.
''Nothing new has happened in the past few weeks. There is no threat
to patient services, there is no possibility of our running out of
money.''
''Our staff provides excellent services for the public. It is quite
unfair to suggest our services are generally unsatisfactory.''
He said a revised financial plan had been drawn up which would see the
trust achieve its financial targets by March 1997. He thought it
unlikely they could achieve them in the current year. The plan was now
with auditors.
Mr Cumming refused to elaborate on the departure of financial director
Douglas Lindsay other than to say: ''We regret his departure and he is
continuing to work with us with my full confidence for the next six
months.''
Asked if his departure was linked to the deficit, he replied: ''I have
no comment.''
Mr Robert Smith, prospective parliamentary candidate for the Liberal
Democrats for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, said: ''Regardless of
whether it is bad management or underfunding, the Government has to sort
it out and not make the people of the North-east pay the price.''
Dr Iain Glen, SNP health spokesman, said the Scottish share of the UK
health budget had been cut two years ago and the effects were only now
being felt.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said last night: ''There is no
question of underfunding. Grampian Health Board, which purchases
services from trusts, has had an increase slightly more than the average
for health boards across the country. It is for trusts to cover
expenditure in the contracting process with purchasers and GPs.''

CONSERVATIVE MP Phil Gallie has attacked the decision of a judge to
free a self-confessed drug dealer as ''ridiculous and dangerous''.
Mr Gallie, the MP for Ayr, has called on the Lord Advocate to review
the case and consider, as a matter of urgency, its recall under existing
criminal procedures.
He said: ''I cannot believe that this young man was turned loose in
the current climate of anti-drug operations and legislation.''
In a strongly-worded letter to Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, Mr Gallie
expresses his shock that Lord McCluskey deferred sentence on Paul Lee,
19, of Greenhill Crescent, Paisley, at the High Court in Kilmarnock.
Lee pled guilty to possessing the Class A drug ecstasy at various
times in Paisley and Saltcoats with intent to supply.
Lord McCluskey deferred sentence on Lee for two years, having taken
into account his previous good record and family circumstances.
Mr Gallie wrote to the Lord Advocate calling for urgent action. He
writes: ''I am advised that . . . Lord McCluskey deferred sentence on
Paul Lee who admitted selling ecstasy outside an Ayrshire night club. It
was stated that Lee had been selling tablets at 10 a time. In understand
that he had 19 tablets in his possession when apprehended.
''On the very day that Lord McCluskey was releasing Lee, a young
17-year-old died after taking ecstasy in a night club in Blackpool.
''Some weeks before Lee was caught, another individual died in a
similar way in the same night club in Saltcoats that Lee was selling
drugs outside of.''
Mr Gallie said last night: ''I was shocked to learn of the judge's
apparent leniency in this case. It seems to me ridiculous and dangerous
to free young men back into the community who have gone before a court
and admitted dealing in a drug which has been shown to cause misery and
death.''

<TEXT>
MURDER squad detectives were yesterday questioning friends and
relatives of a 15-year-old girl after her body was found at a secluded
beauty spot.
Nobantu Zani's decomposed body was found covered with branches on
moorland near Bingley, West Yorkshire. Police said she may have led a
double life, but added that there was no evidence that she had been
working as a prostitute.
Nobantu, who liked to be known as Mandy, had not been reported missing
because her South African mother thought she was staying with a
15-year-old school friend.
The popular teenager had not been seen since September 11, and police
believe she was strangled soon after that date -- with her own chiffon
scarf.
Mandy regularly played truant from Buttershaw Upper School, in
Bradford, and education officers had frequent contact with her family
until the end of last term.
Her body showed no signs of a struggle, and police say that may mean
she knew her killer.
''Her movements and the house in which she was staying are a
mystery,'' said Detective Superintendent Tony Whittle, who is leading a
team of 30 officers on the case.
''We don't know where she was staying, who she was with or how she was
maintaining or supporting herself during that period.''
Mr Whittle said it was not unusual for Mandy to be out of touch with
her family for long periods. He added: ''It may be that she was living
some kind of double life.''
Mr Whittle said there was no evidence that Mandy had been working as a
prostitute, adding that she was a popular girl who may simply have been
''reaching a stage in her life where she wanted more freedom''.
Mr John Hull, Mandy's head teacher, said: ''She was bright,
well-liked, very pleasant and easy to get along with. I remember she was
in our revue show last term and she sang in it karaoke-style. She had a
very good voice.
''I'm extremely distressed. I knew her fairly well.''
Mandy was born in South Africa and moved to Britain in September 1990
to join her mother and two brothers, now aged 10 and 18. Her father, a
lawyer, died in South Africa some years before.

THE Lewis Chessmen -- the world's most expensive chess set -- should
be retained on the island while negotiations over their fate continue
with the British Museum, the leader of the Labour group on Western Isles
Islands Council said last night.
Speaking ahead of a meeting of the council's arts and leisure
committee today -- when councillors will decide whether to request the
set be given ''permanent residence'' on the island -- Councillor Callum
Ian MacMillan said the 840-year-old Norse pieces might never be returned
to the island if they were given back to the British Museum at the end
of a three-month loan period on October 7.
A British Museum spokesman confirmed last night that the museum
trustees were to discuss the row next month but refused to speculate on
the matter.
Mr MacMillan said ideally the Western Isles would like to keep the
pieces but, failing that, it would be prepared to compromise if they
could stay in the islands for part of the year.

<TEXT>
THE way EU governments were balking at ambitious plans to create a
transatlantic free trade area was described as ''absurd'' last night by
Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind.
Some countries were refusing to consider even a study into the
prospects of removing EU-US trade barriers, at a time when similar work
was going ahead with Russia and the Ukraine.
Mr Rifkind, backed by Ireland, Germany, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark,
gave full support at talks in Luxembourg to Commissioner Sir Leon
Brittan's plan to deepen relations with America. The move is being seen
by the Government as a convenient antidote to too much Europe.
Mr Rifkind told Britain's partners that improving EU-US relations
would restore public confidence in Europe.
But France, Belgium, and Portugal all fiercely oppose the idea. They
fear that any overture to America would divert attention away from the
drive for full political and economic integration in Europe itself.
Sir Leon, the commissioner for external economic relations, has
proposed a package of 200 specific measures for strengthening ties
between the EU and the United States, but has stopped short of proposing
concrete measures to reduce and ultimately dismantle transatlantic
tariff barriers.
That is seen as a long-term goal, highly sensitive on both sides of
the Atlantic.
Mr Rifkind said last night: ''Transatlantic free trade is a step
towards global liberalisation. It would be quite absurd for the EU to be
happily endorsing free trade with Russia and the Ukraine, as it now is,
without being prepared to consider similar arrangements with natural
trading partners like the US.
''The discussion will have to continue on this subject.''
Senior EU officials spent the weekend negotiating in Washington and
the aim now is approval of a comprehensive transatlantic deal ready for
endorsement by President Bill Clinton at an EU-US summit scheduled for
early December in Madrid.
Sir Leon's 19-page document envisages far closer transatlantic
co-operation in everything from international security and disarmament
to dismantling trade barriers and working together in the fight against
organised crime, terrorism, and drug trafficking.

Dublin,
DAVID Trimble, the Ulster Unionist Party leader yesterday dampened the
Irish Government's hopes of starting all-party talks among the political
parties in Northern Ireland before Christmas when he met Irish Prime
Minister John Bruton here.
Mr Trimble also made it clear that his party would not contemplate
entry into talks with Sinn Fein until the IRA made a move towards the
destruction of its vast arsenal of arms and explosives.
He also told Mr Bruton that he would not be forced into all-party
talks against his judgment by Prime Minister John Major as part of a
package deal between Dublin and London.
Despite these apparent setbacks to the Irish Government's somewhat
optimistic expectations of an early breakthrough in the peace process,
Mr Trimble gave a badly needed boost to the 13-months-old peace by his
actual presence in Dublin.
Sources close to Mr Trimble said after his historic meeting with Mr
Bruton that both sides were pleased at the ''path-searching encounter''
and spoke positively of new channels of communications having been
opened between Irish Nationalism and Ulster Unionism.
In a calculated change of style from the stand-off attitude adopted by
his predecessor, Mr James Molyneaux, Mr Trimble not only met Mr Bruton
but also the Opposition leaders, Mr Bertie Ahearn of Fianna Fail and
Mary Harney of the Progressive Democrats.
In advance of yesterday's round of talks spin-doctors on the Unionist
side had indicated that Mr Trimble would demand that the Irish Republic
rejoin the Commonwealth and realign its currency with Sterling.
On the Irish side, Government spokesmen had suggested that its aim was
to have all-party political talks under way by mid-December, the second
anniversary of the Downing Street declaration.
Dublin's timetable was driven by its desire to record progress to
President Bill Clinton when the American President visits Dublin later
next month.
In the event, both Mr Bruton and Mr Trimble concentrated on explaining
face to face for the first time their immediate objectives. They also
arranged a series of contacts which will be followed up by officials in
the coming weeks.
Mr Bruton told reporters that there was ''an inexorable move'' to
all-party talks but he conceded that a lot more work remained to be
done.
Mr Trimble said that he would not use a phrase used last week by Mr
Bruton that all-party talks were ''tantalising close''.
However Mr Trimble stressed that, as a result of his meeting with the
Irish Premier, ''channels of communications have been established and we
have demonstrated quite clearly that we are prepared to take the
Unionist case wherever it matters''.
Mr Trimble said he wanted to ensure that there was no opportunity for
misunderstanding by the Irish Government of the Ulster Unionist position
ahead of any efforts to arrange all-party talks.
A lot of agreement was still required on the agenda and other factors
before such talks could be held, he added.
Describing the meeting as constructive, Mr Bruton said that Dublin and
the Ulster Unionists were now engaged in a line of communications which
he believed would bear fruit in the fullness of time.
Mr Trimble is expected to return to Dublin next week for talks with Mr
Dick Spring, the Irish Republic's Foreign Minister, who is currently at
the United Nations in New York.
* The United States administration is sending a business development
mission to Northern Ireland later this month, it was announced last
night.
Fourteen medium-sized American firms are to take part in the visit to
Ulster and Irish border counties from October 15 to 20, the US Consulate
in Belfast said.

COMPLAINTS against British Gas are at an all-time high, according to a
report by the Gas Consumers' Council released last night.
The report reveals that 30,000 people have complained about poor
service and falling standards so far this year -- more than double the
figure for the same period last year.
British Gas admitted last night that ''levels of service fell in the
early part of 1995'' and apologised to customers. It blamed the problems
on ''enormous changes'' in the company required by the Government's
timetable for introducing competition to the domestic gas market from
next year.
However, British Gas could risk losing the Government Charter Mark
that it was awarded for meeting performance targets under the Citizen's
Charter.
The report by the Gas Consumers' Council also said that 9000 families
were left at some stage with no hot water, no gas to cook with and no
central heating.
Council director Ian Powe, said on last night's Watchdog programme on
BBC1 that he would not support British Gas if it applied for a Charter
Mark today.
''I'm afraid they have paid off far too many of their highly paid
staff. They're taking on temporaries who are not of the same level of
training -- and there's confusion in British Gas about who is dealing
with what.''
The company said last night that, when service levels fell, it brought
in extra staff and freephone helplines and that ''99.9%'' of its
customers had not complained.
British Gas's monopoly of supply to Britain's 18 million domestic gas
users is to be phased out over the next few years.
The company has been repeatedly criticised in recent months over
various controversies, including chief executive Cedric Brown's #475,000
salary and the decision to raise the cost of service contracts.
Three million gas users have contracts and the Gas Consumers' Council
has said the rise could have serious safety implications if many people
decide to go without a regular service or rely on ''cowboys''.

SCOTLAND is swinging towards the notion of a completely independent
parliament with its own tax-raising powers, according to a System Three
Poll for The Herald.
Despite the prospect of the so-called tartan tax, almost one in three
voters (32%) are now in favour of the separatists' scenario -- a 4%
increase on the last time the question was asked in January.
The results come, however, with a health warning: the poll was carried
out on the weekend of the SNP conference, and must also be set against
the Braveheart factor, the resurgence in nationalism on the back of the
Hollywood film on William Wallace.
In addition, the prospect of a Scottish Parliament with substantial
powers but within the framework of British Government still remains the
most popular option among the voting public. The figure in favour has
dropped to 36% since January, but at 1% the fall is not significant.
On being told of the results, the leaders of the Scottish Labour Party
and the Scottish National Party were both claiming comfort.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson wrote off the rise in
support for outright independence, saying the Braveheart factor had
played a major role: ''Not surprisingly support for independence has
increased very slightly as a result of the free publicity received by
the SNP at their conference.
''But once the spotlight is turned on the cost of the SNP's policies
and on their glaring splits, devolution will be even more popular.''
Mr Robertson added that the poll should be worrying for Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth: ''It shows that support for devolution
remains solid despite his increasingly hysterical attacks and that Scots
have seen straight through all the Tory lies about tax and a Scottish
Parliament.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said both devolution and retaining the status
quo had lost ground while independence was fast gaining in popularity.
''If the poll posed the SNP's policy of independence in Europe, rather
than a wording which doesn't reflect SNP policy, then support for
independence would be higher still,'' he said.
''The SNP's independence message is capturing the positive mood of the
Scottish people and building confidence in Scotland's bright prospects
as a self-governing nation.''
Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party, said
he was not concerned by the result as the Nationalists were merely
enjoying a temporary ''Braveheart blip'' in their support.
''The reality of independence is a far cry from the fiction presented
by the Nationalists and I am quite certain that the Scottish people will
overwhelmingly reject the SNP as they did at the 1992 General
Election,'' he said.
''We will continue to highlight the dangers of tearing Scotland out of
the United Kingdom whether it's through the SNP's plans for immediate
independence, or through Labour's ill-devised, tax-raising devolution
scheme.''
Scottish Liberal Democrat parliamentary spokeswoman, Mrs Ray Michie,
said the poll results confirmed that Scots are not afraid of higher
taxes to pay for their own parliament.
''Michael Forsyth's tartan tax scaremongering has not had any effect
on the Scottish people,'' she said. ''They are more willing to pay for
decent public services if they have control over their own affairs.''
In the poll, voters were also asked for their attitudes towards a
reduction in income tax in next month's Budget.
Across the parties 58% said they would support a cut in income tax
with 28% opposed. A blow-by-blow account of how the parties' supporters
reacted to that question reveals that 59% of Labour supporters were in
favour of reduction, 61% of Conservatives, 63% of Nationalists, and 48%
of Lib Dems.
Funding for the tax cuts should come from the defence budget,
according to the largest proportion of voters polled (61%) with 4% in
favour of health cuts and 2% in favour of education cuts.
In reaction to that result, Sir Michael Hirst said: ''This poll proves
that the Conservative philosophy of cutting income tax is shared by the
overwhelming majority of Scots.''
Mrs Michie said: ''It is hardly surprising that people prefer the idea
of lower taxes in a vacuum. A more interesting question would have been
whether Scottish people would be willing to pay a little extra tax if
they knew it would go directly to a specific service, for example
education.''
The poll was taken among 1053 people in 40 constituencies across
Scotland between September 21 and 26.

A SHIPMENT of spent nuclear fuel arrived at the Caithness port of
Scrabster last night, prompting furious opposition from environmental
pressure groups.
Police said one man was arrested as a handful of protesters attempted
to prevent the two lorries carrying the fuel leaving Scrabster for
Dounreay.
The cargo from Germany, for which the anti-nuclear movement had been
scouring the country, was landed shortly after 7pm. At 7.30, the two
lorries carrying 52 fuel rods from the Hann Meitner Institute in Berlin
entered the gates of Dounreay.
There was a 20-strong police presence from the Northern Constabulary
and the Atomic Energy Authority for the arrival of the Bremen-registered
roll-on roll-off cargo vessel Arneb but initially only one protester,
the veteran anti-nuclear campaigner, Mr Ian Thomson.
Before the Arneb had docked, the police arrested Mr Thomson for breach
of the peace.
Later a small crowd of local people had gathered. One was Mrs Marjorie
MacKenzie, secretary of Caithness Against Nuclear Dumping. ''This is the
start of Scotland becoming a nuclear dustbin. It is disgraceful.
Dounreay can't even cope with what it has,'' she said.
The anti-nuclear movement fears that the cargo, the first of spent
fuel to come into Scrabster from abroad, will be the start of a
long-term reprocessing programme at Dounreay. Up to 15,000 rods are
awaiting transfer at research reactors throughout Europe and further
afield.
Mr Shaun Burnie, research co-ordinator for Greenpeace International,
said that although only about 5000 would come to Dounreay, ''that is one
load every four weeks for the next 10 years. The people of Scotland have
got to realise that is what they are facing.''
Mr Ian Shepherd, the Atomic Energy Authority spokesman at Dounreay,
said the spent fuel was coming from research reactors, some of which
face closure unless they could transfer their fuel rods. These reactors
were involved in nuclear medicine so their closure would be a loss to
society.
''We would also stress that we have been transporting nuclear cargoes
for reprocessing here for over 30 years without any harm being done to
any member of the public or to anybody on the site. That is a good
record.''
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, meanwhile, has turned down a
request to hold a public inquiry into the operation of a now-disused
waste shaft at Dounreay. The shaft wasthe scene of an explosion in 1977.
Caithness Against Nuclear Dumping had called for an inquiry to
establish the contents of the 65-metre deep shaft.
In a letter, a spokesman for the Scottish Secretary says details of
the internal investigation into the explosion have been passed to
nuclear regulatory and advisory bodies.

Washington
THE jury in the O J Simpson trial reached verdicts yesterday after
less than four hours of deliberations, but they will not be revealed
until today.
Judge Lance Ito, as astonished as everybody else at the rapidity of
the finding after eight months of evidence, said the verdicts could not
be announced until the trial lawyers were gathered. The verdicts will be
read at 6pm BST today.
Simpson, 48, and his attorney Carl Douglas appeared shocked by the
news. Simpson stood, biting his lip and staring at the jurors as they
filed into the courtroom.
Many of the legal teams marshalled on both sides had left Los Angeles,
assuming that the jury would take days or weeks to reach a verdict. They
must now be summoned back to hear the results.
Simpson is accused of murdering his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson,
and an acquaintance, Ron Goldman. They were stabbed and slashed to death
in June last year. Mr Simpson was arrested and charged with the crime a
few days later.
His trial has been one of the longest and most sensational in American
history, and everyone expected the jury to take a long time to reach a
verdict.
The first assumption was that the jury had held a first vote when it
convened, found that they were nearly agreed, and easily reached a
conclusion immediately afterwards.
Commentators wondered why the judge was so solicitous of the lawyers'
interests. They have done their jobs, could learn the result from
television, like everyone else, and the jury could at last go home. They
have been sequestered in a motel since the end of January.
It is possible that the jury has concluded that the evidence was so
conflicting that Simpson must be acquitted.
However that would not explain why, when it first convened yesterday,
the members of the jury asked to be read a passage of the evidence
relating to the limousine driver who came to take Mr Simpson to the
airport on the night of the murders.
He had to wait half an hour before the gate was opened and the
prosecution alleges that during that time Mr Simpson murdered his
ex-wife.
The prosecution claims that when he got home, he saw the limousine and
ran round the side of the house, climbed over the fence and slipped in
the door. The driver testified that he had not noticed the car, Mr
Simpson's famous white Bronco, when he arrived.
It was found round the corner later. The driver also testified that he
saw a black man enter the house. The lights then went on and then the
gate was opened for him.
The jury listened as the driver's evidence was read back to them, and
returned to the jury room. They broke for lunch and at 2.30 Los Angeles
time (10.30pm in Britain) they suddenly reappeared with a verdict.
None of this indicates what the jury has decided. Why was the driver's
evidence, alone, worth considering, of all the 50,000 pages of evidence
presented over nine months?
Does this mean that the jury disregarded the defence team's passionate
arguments about race and the Los Angeles Police Department, and stuck to
the simplest evidence of all?
Only one thing is certain. There will not be a hung jury, or a second
O J trial.

THERE was another leak row last night, this time over the relationship
between Labour and the unions.
Minutes of a meeting between union chiefs and the Labour leader and
his deputy John Prescott held a fortnight ago show Mr Tony Blair
promising improved rights and expecting union aid in key seats,
according to the minutes leaked to the Daily Telegraph.
Some 12 union leaders are said to have attended the meeting of the
National Trade Union and Labour Party liaison committee. The session was
chaired by TGWU leader Bill Morris.
According to the minutes, Mr Blair outlined his ''priorities in the
preparation for the General Election''. Top was a pledge on the ''agenda
for rights at work'' which included signing up to Europe's social
chapter, a national minimum wage and the right to union representation
at work. Mr Blair reportedly emphasised he was expecting union officials
and activists to play a major role in key seats and he hoped they would
join constituency campaign teams.
Days earlier Mr Blair told the TUC in Brighton the unions would have
no more right to persuade a Labour government to take action than
employers.
A spokesman for Mr Blair's office said: ''The fact that trade union
leaders meet Tony Blair is well known. The fact that trade unions give
support to Labour during elections is equally well known.''
Tory Party chairman Brian Mawhinney called it ''a shabby deal''.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair will today produce costed commitments for the
next General Election, itemising, for the first time, definite pledges
for a Labour government. The costs will be more than #1bn.
He believes he can do it without extra charge on the ordinary
taxpayer.
Class sizes in primary schools are to be reduced below 30, along with
a package for single parents. Medical science is to get a boost because
Mr Blair believes the race for knowledge will shape the next century.
The National Lottery is to be turned into a non-profitmaking
operation, and there is to be a massive ''windfall tax'' on the profits
of privatised utilities. His Shadow Chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown, told
the Labour conference yesterday he would use this windfall tax to
abolish youth unemployment.
This alone could cost #1.4bn. Reducing class sizes will take #110m. Mr
Brown believes this can be found by scrapping the assisted places scheme
for state pupils to go to private schools.
Today Mr Blair is expected to meet the growing demand for New Labour
policy and commitments to it. His bridge for this: equipping a new
Britain to meet the challenges of the next century which he will tell
the conference will require a supreme national effort.
He will remind the Labour rank and file: ''I didn't come into politics
just to transform the party, but to transform the country.''
The cautious Shadow Chancellor confined himself to ''priorities'' for
a Labour Government: the abolition of youth unemployment, a new
#75-a-week incentive to help the long-term jobless into work, releasing
local authorities' housing capital receipts for building, modernising
the welfare state. ''Over time, all long-term unemployed will be given
the chance to get back to work.''
The biggest priority is to reduce VAT on domestic fuel, bringing it
down to 5%, as low as Brussels will allow. This could cost his Treasury
about #500m. But the cutting of this unpopular Tory tax is reckoned to
be a big Labour vote winner, justifiable on moral grounds.
''In three years, the only tax cut people have seen is a Labour tax
cut by Labour defeating the Tory plans to raise fuel VAT to 17.5%,'' Mr
Brown said.
Later Mr Blair turned on the SNP's exploitation of the film
Braveheart. At the conference's Scottish night celebrations, he said the
people of Scotland would never be taken in by the SNP. ''However you
dress it up, whatever lengths they employ, whatever attempts to take
comfort from films, you can never hide the true nature of the SNP.''
He reasserted his commitment to a Scottish Parliament ''in the first
year of a Labour term''.
Other commitments will be introduced today when Mr Blair will take the
attack on the Tories a step further in his keynote conference speech:
there will not be just priorities, but definite pledges. His aides
claimed these promises will be fully costed before the Tories can get at
them at their conference in Blackpool next week.
Looking forward to his speech today, Mr Blair can look back to another
good day yesterday. He came out the winner on all the key issues. The
election for his National Executive left him with a 24-2 majority for
his modernising of both party and policy.
The hot dispute of setting a minimum wage of #4.15 was kicked into
touch for another year at least, as was a motion to commit a Labour
government to renationalising all the privatised utilities. And today
defiance from the conference on the banning of left-winger Liz Davies as
a parliamentary candidate is unlikely.
But the next big step for Mr Blair will come when he begins to specify
Labour government policy at last.
