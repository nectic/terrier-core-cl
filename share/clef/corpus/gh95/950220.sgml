THE human performance laboratory at Cramond Campus is the sort of
environment in which you imagine you would find top athletes wired up to
all manner of machinery, with boffins in white coats fussing around on
the periphery, checking print-outs and scribbling on pads. Hardly the
place to come across a sub-species.
Yet, there they were, a splinter group of the human race.
Five football referees gathered in one place, and not just a random
group either. A quintet of FIFA-ranked referees being put through
gruelling stamina tests in an Edinburgh lab.
They pounded treadmills as an occasional student glanced through a
window anxious to see who were being tested. ''It's that McCluskey,''
one of them said. ''And look, it's . . . it's Mottram.''
Strange the way referees are given the same press coverage as pit-bull
terriers and English supporters. Are they like us in any way? Do they
ever smile? Would they bleed if cut? Does the abuse which rains down on
them register and cause them pain?
''Of course it can hurt,'' said Jim McCluskey, who has been a Grade 1
referee for 11 years and on FIFA's list for nine. ''You condition
yourself to accept the abuse, no matter how spiteful. You either handle
it or walk away.''
At close quarters McCluskey looked remarkably like a 44-year-old
normal man. And he smiled, too. Astonishing.
''Sometimes if I go to a pub or a dance with my wife there will be
someone determined to take issue,'' said Les Mottram, a Grade 1 referee
of seven years standing and who has been used by FIFA for the past five
years. ''You walk away and you condition your children to do the same
when they encounter trouble.''
McCluskey and Mottram, regarded as the best of Scotland's referees,
were on the campus for tests along with three more of the country's
seven FIFA officials, Hugh Dallas, Kenny Clark, and John Rowbotham --
Andrew Waddell and Willie Young are to be tested at a later date -- and
they were equally approachable.
However, the most surprising collective trait of this group was a
willingness to talk. An opportunity not to be missed.
So, McCluskey from Stewarton, you were in charge when Aberdeen beat
Rangers 2-0 at Pittodrie last week and two of the Ibrox club's players,
Charlie Miller and Brian Laudrup, looked as though they could have had a
penalty each. With the benefit of hindsight, should Rangers have had two
penalties?
''I didn't see the highlights on television until the following
night,'' McCluskey said, ''and, yes, I saw the incidents differently.
They looked like penalties.
''However, what television didn't show was my position. I didn't have
the benefit of replays and angles which television provides for the
public, and when you realise later you've made a mistake, believe me,
you feel down.''
Mottram of Harthill shifted nervously. ''You're going to ask about the
incident at Firhill a couple of years ago,'' he said.
Actually, Les, I was going to ask where how you enjoyed refereeing in
the last World Cup finals, but since you have mentioned The Firhill
Incident, The Goal That Wasn't, don't let me stop you. But first a
resume.
It was February '93 during a match between Partick Thistle and Dundee
United, whose Paddy Connolly scored with a powerful shot. Mottram didn't
see the goal, even though Thistle's Martin Clark, standing inside his
own box, picked the ball up as it came back out of the net.
If it wasn't a goal, then a penalty should have been awarded, but
half-time arrived and Mottram retreated indoors to quell his confusion.
''What can I say now,'' Mottram, a 43-year-old head teacher at
Calderhead High School, began. ''The shot was so hard the ball hit a
stanchion and came back out before I realised. I just didn't see it. It
was a mistake and I have to live it.''
It is an unfortunate fact of life that only referees' errors are
highlighted in replay. Yet, the capability to work in hostile
environments with the condemning eye of television looking on is the
true measure of a referee.
Grade 1 referees must observe strict training regimes -- they require
three sessions a week -- and added to the travelling and hours spent at
courses large parts of their weeks, often more than 20 hours, are
consumed. There are sacrifices and a severe strain can be put on their
family lives.
Their reward, apart from a league match fee of #110, is abuse and
ridicule. Why then do they do it?
''First, we are all supporters who love the game and believe we can
help it progress,'' said 39-year-old Rowbotham, who has been Grade 1 for
two years and whose son, Ross, also wants to become a top referee. ''We
can help make the game more attractive, but we need help from players
and managers.''
Rowbotham, a department manager with a confectionary firm, was
supported by Dallas, who, like McCluskey, runs his own company. ''If
everyone played within the laws of the game that would help greatly,''
said the 37-year-old. ''We need more honesty from players, but the media
focus on referees, perhaps because we are easy targets.
''We are always on trial whether we are being judged by a supervisor
in the stand or by cameras. There can be occasions when you go home and
someone in your own house will greet you with 'Well, you got that one
wrong,' although mostly a referee's family is very supportive.''
Clark, who is a lawyer by day, insisted it simply isn't true of any
footballer to suggest referees are no longer willing to have a quiet
word as they run by during matches. ''The problem is some players will
not respond to that,'' he said. ''They take the huff.''
''That's absolutely true,'' McCluskey added. ''Usually there are one
or two players in every team who can be approached and sometimes even
they can't deal with certain members of their teams.
''The thing is, no referee wants to caution a player, because as soon
as you do, the heat of the game rises.''
None of the referees believes full-time officials would improve
standards and all doubt whether controversy would be killed off or even
eased if they were required to explain decisions after matches.
''So far as offering explanations afterwards is concerned a referee
would end up being analysed twice,'' Clark suggested. ''At the moment
our decisions are scrutinised and if we say why we gave a particular
ruling, then everybody would then want to examine our comments.''
As the others nodded in agreement, Mottram had his final say. ''We are
fans and we are steeped in football's traditions, but maybe the public
should look a little deeper and try to understand.''
Perhaps they could, but inconsistency among referees who see incidents
in different ways seems to be a particular problem, although Dallas
asks: ''The laws of the game state: 'In the opinion of the referee . .
.' and is not opinion a great part of football?
''Only if robots were to be programmed and used as referees would we
have that kind of consistency.''
''And after all,'' Rowbotham said, ''we are only human.''
Indeed, but the student at the window might take some convincing.

THE balanced diet of forward and back play, representing a far more
rounded performance than for some time, was one of the most encouraging
features of a famous Scottish triumph at Parc des Princes.
This Scotland was far less predictable, as different questions were
asked of the French with the effect that almost every time Scotland put
together a concerted effort they managed to transform their
opportunities into points.
Craig Chalmers played more the style of game in which he revels when
decisions had to be taken about which option to select.
As a result, the Scottish centres responded with admirable displays of
their contrasting qualities.
And, because the ball was moved beyond the stand-off with some
frequency, there were opportunities for Gavin Hastings to demonstrate
that he is yet a player of world class and far from the dreadnought that
some have suggested.
His loop off Gregor Townsend and line straightening prior to the
Townsend try were clear evidence of that. Chalmers also rang more
changes in his punt repertoire.
His Garryowen placements need a bit of fine tuning, but it was typical
when he teased the French with one evil high ball then, virtually in the
same move, sent a beautifully weighted diagonal to near their corner
flag.
Just as pleasing was the manner in which the Scots stitched together
spells of continuity in which backs and forwards intermingled the action
with a high degree of skill.
There was no better example of this than the rippling move, admittedly
with a small portion of good luck, for the Townsend try. It was a
shattering blow to the French, because Hastings had just cut the deficit
to 5-3 with his first penalty goal.
From kick-off, the Scots had linked close on a dozen passes together,
added in one bit of second phase (Stewart Campbell winning the kick-off
and Damian Cronin delivering maul ball), another helping of later phase
when Craig Joiner got to within 15 metre,s and finally the risk of a
misspass that Townsend controlled like a veteran.
Within that continuity flow there were passes by backs as well as
special touches of creativity by forwards -- snappy regeneration by Iain
Morrison, an improvised basketball-type feed from Cronin, and a
delicious little take-and-give by Peter Wright.
In other words, everyone had to make a decision. As all the backs were
actively involved, it was a sequence that must have delighted the
coaches, Douglas Morgan and Richie Dixon, as the kind of pattern they
have been encouraging in which backs and forwards are almost
indistinguishable.
Wright does not look out of place in the intermingling process because
he doesn't attempt to take on something for which he is not suited.
Instead, he either zonks into an opponent to set up delivery or, as
twice on Saturday, he simply acts as a sure link in the chain. The
Boroughmuir prop is now a more complete footballer.
Another advantage to Scotland was the way in which they played out of
their skins in pressurising Frenchmen dealing with Scottish punts.
The fielder generally was afforded desperately little time on the ball
as, for instance, late on when Kenny Logan, who laid down his aggressive
benchmark early on, roared after a Chalmers diagonal and clattered both
Philippe Bernat-Salles and Jean-Luc Sadourny in the one action.
Most heartening of all, however, was that Scottish cocktail with its
mixture of pass and punt by which they moved the point of the ball,
sought to keep it alive, and thus didn't ask the same question every
time.
It is a style that the coaches will seek to develop further and that
not only will render Scotland more difficult to beat, but one that will
make them far more exciting to watch.

JACK Webster's interesting article ''A world apart with need for
success at any price'' (February 13) much lamented the sorry situation
concerning Mr Willie Miller, former manager of Aberdeen FC.
Mr Webster laid great store on the fact that Mr Miller was a great
player for the Dons and was much respected by many Aberdonians. It is
more than true to say that no-one can take any pleasure in the ending of
Mr Miller's managerial relationship with Aberdeen FC. Everyone will be
sad -- the players, the fans, all football supporters of whatever club,
and Mr Miller.
I tend to think the problem is, alas, with the amateurish way that
football is managed. It is correct to say that Mr Miller was a great
player, but that does not make him a great, or even a moderately good,
manager. The late Jock Stein, it may be argued, was Scotland's greatest
club manager but he was not Scotland's greatest footballer.
Until Scottish football realises that there are great differences
between the great player on the field and the manager off the field and
provides suitable training courses for prospective managers then, alas,
the great tragedy of Willie Miller will be repeated again and again.
The greatest craftsman is not always the greatest gaffer.

THIS may come as something of a surprise, then again perhaps it won't,
given that the SFA are involved. It would seem the SFA's own technical
department may not be what it appears, technically speaking, of course.
By the end of this year, only those managers and coaches who have been
put through E and D coaching courses will be allowed to work with
children 12-years-old and under, and most of the Scottish League's
football people went through the Largs coaching classes before the E and
D parts came into being.
Unless Jim McLean, Walter Smith, Alex Miller et al go back to school,
they won't be able to coach aspiring young footballers.
According to someone within Bleak House, the SFA's national team
manager, Craig Brown, who is also technical director, hasn't been put
through the E and D early-touches courses, and if he fails to enrol in
his own staff's classes by December 31 -- we must presume he would
perform well enough not to require a resit, provided he wishes to
undertake the courses -- even he would be unable to coach kids.
Furthermore, almost all of his department's staff would have to go
through the courses. It is thought only Eric Black, a relative newcomer
to the coaching scene, would be exempt because his A licence was
probably achieved within the last 18 months, which means he will have
covered a section dealing with the philosophy of how to work with
children.
That will be sufficient to earn him exemption from the E and D
courses, but everyone who went through the top course more than a year
and a half ago will be lacking in the eyes of the SFA come the end of
the year.
Again technically speaking, Black would be the most qualified coach on
the association's staff in paper terms and he, the youngest member of
the technical department, would be able to invite his seniors, including
Brown, to undertake the necessary courses.
Confused? Good, that means you are just about ready to take another
SFA exercise, the X course, which teaches how to draw diagrams while
talking Kalashnikov-style before eventually disappearing up your own
conclusions.
Of course, the SFA will probably maintain their own people, who shaped
the E and D courses, be exempt from having to go through them, and say
the ruling will apply only to senior clubs, but will that be fair? Why
should others have to do what the association's own department do not?
The managers and coaches who will be affected -- and that will be most
of them in the Scottish League -- might choke after initial guffaws,
especially Jim McLean, who has just opened a coaching clinic for
children in Dundee.
Proud as punch he was as he stood amid a gaggle of young hopefuls,
children who dream of one day becoming professional football players.
The Dundee United chairman, who can draw from a reservoir of experience
deeper than any other, has started schooling youngsters in his club's
area, and by all accounts he is having a wonderful time. He's like a new
man, but it won't be allowed to last.
The SFA initiative will debar him from working with 12s and under even
though he is one of the most knowledgeable coaches in the country.
Unless he goes back to football school, it won't matter that he was
responsible for shaping Dundee United into a formidable force in the 70s
and 80s.
McLean, for all his mood swings, is appreciated as the manager who,
from limited resources, constructed a team capable of breaking Old Firm
supremacy, and he is also remembered as the man who gave United
credibility on foreign fields. No one needs a licence to realise he has
some kind of knowledge, an understanding of what is required to succeed,
but unfortunately for him that won't be enough come the end of December.
McLean, like just about every other manager in the country, has his A
licence, the top qualification, but he and they are two letters short of
the genuine article so far as the SFA are concerned.
The SFA are adamant anyone within a senior club who wants to coach
children must have tackled the basic classes D and E classes, which do
little more than highlight the obvious need to treat young and
impressionable minds in a different manner from older players.
McLean and all those who passed through Largs many moons ago will be
denied the opportunity to coach the players of tomorrow from an early
age, which is when expert opinion suggests work should begin. Frankly,
it is stupid, so obviously bureaucratic. So typically SFA, who are
consumed with the need to be politically correct.
It is unlikely the ''unqualified'' will go back to Largs, and they
would be foolish to do so. I can't see Walter Smith going and Alex
Miller, who is so highly rated he is assistant national team manager,
won't go either. And Tommy McLean, who took Motherwell to new heights,
Tommy Burns, or Ivan Golac, who repeatedly preaches the need to use
skill and imagination more than more basic instincts? Don't think so.
In fact, there is not a manager in the premier division who has a
suitable A licence or who has taken the D and E courses, yet they are
among the most astute football coaches in the country.
However, the SFA are about to make the combination of experience and
ability a bankrupt currency in the world of football and who will
suffer? The children, of course.

DREW Docherty, beaten by Alfred Kotey in a world bantamweight title
fight on Friday night, will not be taking any time out to feel sorry for
himself.
The 29-year-old British champion is being lined up for a second shot
at the European championship -- his only other professional defeat was
when losing to Vincenzo Belcastro, of Italy, for that crown last year.
The current European holder is Naseem Hamed, who is due to make a
mandatory defence against Denmark's Johnny Bredahl, the official No.1
challenger. But there are doubts as to whether Hamed will continue in
the bantamweight division, and if he relinquishes the title, Docherty
will demand to be considered as an opponent for the Dane.
* STEPHEN Wilson, and Scotland's big hope in the light-heavyweight
division, has had to withdraw from tonight's scheduled bout against Ray
Webb at the St Andrew's Sporting Club in Glasgow's Forte Crest Hotel.
The Scot has an eye injury and Webb will now meet fellow Englishman
Craig Joseph.
The main Scottish interest now switches to unbeaten flyweight Keith
Knox, of Bonnyrigg. He meets Lyndon Kershaw, of Halifax, and although he
must be favourite to extend his unbeaten run to six, it could be an
awkward contest.
Robert Hay, from Coatbridge, who only recently turned professional
with Tommy Gilmour, makes an early debut and there will be much interest
in his contest against Sheffield super-featherweight Mohammed Shaffique.
The bill is completed with another super-feather contest between Paul
Watson, of Coatbridge, also making his professional debut and Paul
Goode, from Kettering.
* GLASGOW'S Gary Jacobs has had a change of opponent for his fight in
Atlantic City on March 4. He was to have met Tom Alexander but he has
called off and Jacobs will now go in against New Jersey's Jose Miguel
Fernandez.

A CLOSING round of 64 over the Wanderers Club in Johannesburg earned
Ernie Els a second Lexington South African PGA Championship in four
years here last night. More significantly, it was his seventh victory in
13 months.
His latest success underlined the US Open champion's increasing
dominance since he burst on to his native South African circuit.
Great things had been predicted for the golfer from the Transvaal and
he is fulfilling every expectation.
This winter he has played four times in the Republic and his record
reads second, first, second, and first again.
He began the final round of the European Tour's first co-sanctioned
tournament in South Africa two strokes behind Namibia's Trevor Dodds but
everyone, opponents included, seemed aware of the inevitably of yet
another Els triumph.
When he opened with a birdie and added three more in succession from
the fifth to reach the turn in 31, the outcome was virtually a
formality.
To his credit, Els' playing partner Englishman Van Phillips refused to
be intimidated and shot a 66 to share third place behind Roger Wessels,
who matched Els' 64.
Craig Ronald picked up his first European Tour cheque, worth around
#1500, but his disappointment at letting a good final round slip by
finding bunkers at the fifteenth and sixteenth to drop three shots and
finish with a par 70, was tempered by the cushion of his cheque and the
anticipation of seeing his baby daughter, Taylor, this morning.
He has seen her for a mere 15 minutes since she was born three weeks
ago and Ronald's wife, Lorraine, flew down to London from Glasgow to
spend the day with the proud new dad.
''But they will fly straight back to Glasgow and I head to Valencia
for the Mediterranean Open,'' said Ronald. ''Now that I have started
earning money I must keep going. I want to play tournament golf for as
long as possible and a good start to my career is essential.''
He finished on a five-over-par total of 275, one stroke worse than
Scottish champion Andrew Coltart who shot a second successive 69. Bill
Longmuir (72) and Brian Marchbank (73) wound up seven over while Dean
Robertson cannot get home quickly enough to see coach Bob Torrance.
''I have not had a lesson since October and while I am making cuts and
earning money I am hitting the ball over the place,'' he said. Instead
of going to Spain I am heading for Largs.'' Leading final aggregates (S
African unless stated):
271 -- E Els 65, 71, 71, 64 (#39,478).
273 -- R Wessels 68, 72, 69, 64 (#28,748).

* TOMMY Armour III, using hi-tech clubs he helped to design and which
his eminent grandfather, The Silver Scot, would have boggled at, went
out in 31 with five birdies at Bermuda Dunes here in California
yesterday to reach 23 under par and stand within reach of the leader,
Kentuckian Kenny Perry, in the fifth and last round of the Bob Hope
Chrysler Classic, writes John Ball.
Armour, 35, whose only tour victory was in the 1990 Phoenix Open,
scored 4, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 4 to the turn, on a day when temperatures
soared over 90[DEG]F.
The heat was on Perry, who was 25 under par at the turn and one in
front of rookies Tommy Tolles, David Duval, and Dillard Pruitt with
Curtis Strange, 40, the US Open champion of 1988 and 1989 at 23 under
after nine holes. A finish as sizzling as the weather looked likely.

FRANK Bruno stripped off a scarlet silk dressing gown to display his
awesome array of muscles, acknowledged the deafening roars of the
adoring gallery, and Rodolfo Marin seemed to wither away with stage
fright.
That was probably a major reason for the Puerto Rican's 65-second
fold-up in the agricultural setting of Shepton Mallet on Saturday night
when the script was designed to give Big Frank a few rounds of decent
opposition.
The 33-year-old had Marin on the floor twice. He landed a right hand
to the top of Marin's head that sent him to the floor after only 30
seconds. Marin got to his feet after a count of five and Bruno landed
two sharp left jabs and then a left hook that ended the fight.
While Marin was on the floor taking referee John Coyle's full count,
Bruno was doubtless preparing himself to be cast in the role of fall
guy, even though he could not justifiably be panned for his walk-on
part.
The most damaging fists this side of the Atlantic have inflicted
similar first-round treatment on other imports, most recently Jesse
Ferguson, yet Bruno has been the one to take it on the chin from
ringside critics.
No amount of farce headlines can seemingly prevent Bruno from fighting
the winner of the April 8 clash between WBC champion Oliver McCall and
veteran Larry Holmes in Las Vegas (Bruno would prefer McCall) and the
British favourite has been invited as VIP guest depending on the birth
date of his third child.
Promoter Frank Warren reiterated his promise to deliver a June world
title shot for Bruno in London while Marin was in the dressing room
nursing his nose.
Boxing board secretary John Morris believes Marin was overcome by the
whole thing, even before Bruno took a stride out of his corner.
''Frank is back and obviously in great nick. He is 17[1/2] stone and
hitting very hard. He had an opponent who could not take his punches,''
said Morris, ruling out any kind of inquiry into Marin's brief
appearance.
''In my opinion, Marin could not take the pressure of the occasion. It
got to him beforehand. He was very edgy at the weigh-in and in the
dressing room. Then Frank caught him with punches to the chin. Bruno did
his job and I defend him on it.''
Morris added: ''Frank's been beaten only by world champions and if he
fights McCall I'm backing Frank to beat him and become world champion.''
Bruno's new main paymaster, ITV head of sport Trevor East, confessed
to having ''sympathy'' for Frank and insists many opponents are running
scared of him.
Bruno and his camp shrugged off the television criticism of Lennox
Lewis' new trainer and motivator Emanuel Steward at ringside.
Bruno said: ''I can only do the job to the best of my ability, and do
it as quickly as possible. It was a cool, clear, calculated jab -- I did
a good number on him. Marin was no fat, out-of-shape heavyweight. He
came here to try and fight but I did not give him a chance.''
Bruno is left to contemplate the fact he has only had 207 seconds of
ring action since losing his WBC bid against Lewis and will go into his
night of destiny against McCall or Holmes with little over a round of
public boxing in 20 months.

JOHN Higgins emerged as a star of the present, rather than the future,
by beating one of his former heroes, Steve Davis, in the final of the
#325,000 Sweater Shop International Open at Bournemouth last night.
The 19-year-old Scot proved beyond doubt that winning the World
Championship in two months' time is not beyond him by beating Davis 9-5
in a gruelling final which lasted seven hours all but five minutes.
Higgins pocketed a winner's cheque for #60,000 and the keys of a
Mercedes car worth an additional #32,000.
In the process, he took his total prize money for the 1994-95 season
past the #200,000 mark.
One person impressed by the teenager's display was Davis himself, who
said: ''John's got it all. He's learnt very well and very quickly. He
plays enough of a balanced game to have a great chance at the
Crucible.''
Only three weeks ago in Newport, Higgins showed his inexperience when
he was trounced 9-3 by Davis in the final of the Regal Welsh Open.
However, from the moment Higgins potted pink and black to snatch the
first frame yesterday, it was obvious he was determined to avoid a
repeat.
Despite the exchanges being extremely slow early on, Higgins
maintained his concentration sufficiently to establish a slender 4-3
lead after the opening session.
On the restart Higgins, whose victims on the way to the final have
included world No.12 Joe Swail and seventh seed Ken Doherty, began to
fire on all cylinders.
Adopting a more belligerent approach, Higgins, who made a big
breakthrough by winning the Skoda Grand Prix title in October, knocked
in breaks of 51, 35, 45, and 102 as he won three of the next five frames
to open a two-frame gap at 7-5.
That century -- the third compiled by Higgins during the course of the
tournament -- seemed to unsettle Davis, who then started to miss
relatively easy pots.
With Davis suddenly vulnerable, Higgins remained in top gear as
further contributions of 48 and 65 enabled him to cross the winning
line.
Higgins said: ''To win any title is superb, but when you beat someone
who has been your boyhood hero it's extra special.
''I'm delighted with the result and I've never felt more confident
about my game.
''The satisfying thing is that I matched Steve in the safety
department and then outscored him.
''If you haven't played him before, it's impossible to say just how
hard a competitor Steve is.''
Higgins , also successful in the Australian Open this season, is now
second to his fellow countryman Stephen Hendry on the seasonal money
list and also in world-ranking points earned for 1994-95.
After having seen his 11-match unbeaten run in ranking events come to
an end, Davis was adamant that the defeat would not be a long-term
setback.
The 37-year-old from Romford declared: ''I am not embarrassed to lose
to a great player. It's a pleasure to see the game played properly and I
can only welcome him to the fold.''
Higgins, who revealed that he will keep the Mercedes, along with his
present car, a Ford Mondeo, said: ''It was brilliant. Brilliant.
Brilliant.
''Steve didn't play as well as he can, but I battled hard all day and
I feel that's something to be proud of. I'll never forget this
victory.''

ABERDEEN crews dominated Saturday's Inverness Eights Head of the River
Race, taking victory in four of the seven categories.
The Aberdeen men's squad has put in a hefty winter training programme
and the evidence of this showed when their first eight -- a composite of
Aberdeen Boat Club, Robert Gordon's University, and Aberdeen University
beat Glasgow University by more than half a minute, covering the
three-mile course on the Caledonian Canal in 15min 21sec.
Not to be outdone, their men's restricted crew, a composite of
Aberdeen Boat Club and Robert Gordon's University, were convincing
winners of their category in 16min 6sec, comfortably ahead of Inverness.
The men's novice category went to Aberdeen Boat Club, while Aberdeen
University won the women's novice division.
Clydesdale landed a double -- in the women's open category and the
men's veteran division to make their long journey worthwhile, and
Glasgow University Ladies took the honours in the women's restricted
category.

GARETH Rudd, one of a small band of older Scottish ski racers
attempting to scale the world rankings with the career security of a
university degree under his belt returned from Europe to the chill and
blustery slopes of Nevis Range's Snowgoose to lift the North West
Seniors FIS slalom title on Saturday.
Nevis Range's new soft snow offered a brief respite from the hard
man-made snow and steep, demanding slaloms of Europe, and a technically
accomplished run saw Rudd lying in third place after the fast,
comparatively straight first course.
Title holder Michael Pilarski made an early exit after getting caught
sitting back on his skis on the steep section.
The more demanding turns of the second run took their toll. Rudd was
among those who faltered -- still winning with the second quickest
second run, despite momentarily stopping. Duncan Barton, second after
the first run, made a similar error but lost more time dropping to
fourth, while early leader Ross Baxter did not complete the second run.
The Women's entry was the strongest ever with two British Team girls,
Shona Robertson and Lesley McKenna home for a rest and the race.
Robertson attacked on the second run to turn Tessa Pirie's three
hundredths lead to a deficit of 15 hundredths to take the title.
Results:
1
Womens slalom -- 1st Shona Robertson (Hanson and Robertson Womens
Europa Cup team) 44.12 seconds, 45.61seconds, total 1 minute

KIRSTY Hay added the Scottish title to her long list of honours in
Kilmarnock yesterday when along with team mates Katie Loudon, Joanna
Pegg, and Edith Loudon, she won the final of the Royal Bank of Scotland
Scottish Ladies Curling Championships, beating Debbie Knox 7-3.
To reach the final, Hay had beaten Carolyn Hutcheson 9-3 yesterday
morning, while Knox, playing at skip for the first time this week, beat
Rhona Martin by 6-3. The final was a cagey affair for the first five
ends. Hay blanked the first and then took singles at both the second and
third ends to take a 2-0 lead. Knox responded with singles at the next
two ends tying up the score at two each for the half-way break.
In the sixth end, Knox failed to remove a Hay counter with her last
stone, leaving Hay a simple draw for two to retake a lead which she
never lost. Knox again nudged a Hay counting shot with her last stone in
the seventh, but failed to take it out and this gave a steal to Hay and
a 5-2 lead.
Now facing a mountain to climb to get back into the game, lady luck
also deserted Knox's team in the eighth end when the second stone of
third player Julia Ewart picked up and slewed off to the side of the
rink. Knox tried a difficult promote with her last stone in the eighth,
but it, too, was not strong enough and Hay gained another two shots for
a 7-2 lead.
A straight forward hit and roll gave Knox a single at the ninth end,
but she was forced to concede defeat in the tenth.
Hay's team, all experienced performers at world junior and European
level, now go forward to their first-ever world championships at
Brandon, Manitoba, in April. Line scores:
Hay 0 1 1 0 0 2 1 2 0  x 7

SHINTY faces a brush with the law following an incident at Kiltarlity
in which one of the game's grade one referees was left with a split
upper lip.
Inverness referee Donald MacFadyen has reported the incident,
involving Lovat's midfielder Roddy Munro, to the police and the matter
will be handed over to the procurator fiscal in Inverness.
The incident came in the sixty-fifth minute of an ill-tempered Keyline
MacAulay Cup-tie between Lovat and Fort William. Fort were leading 3-0
when Munro was booked for a heavy challenge on Fort William's Ian Smith,
who had himself been involved in an earlier incident with Munro's
brother Steven. Smith indulged in fisticuffs which wasn't seen by
referee MacFadyen, but was spotted by a goal judge.
The second incident culminated in Roddy Munro being shown the red card
for alleged verbal abuse while being booked. Following the incident, the
referee was left with a split upper lip.
The match was re-started by the referee several minutes later after
treatment and concluded without further incident.
One of the Lovat team, full forward Allan MacRae, is an officer with
Northern Constabulary. He missed the recent North Qualifying Cup final
at Inverness due to suspension for three bookings. Results:
Glenmorangie Ballimore Cup. Second round -- Caberfeidh 4, Bute 1;
Lochcarron 2, Kinlochshiel 0. Glenmorangie Sutherland Cup. Third round

YEVGENY Kafelnikov upset Boris Becker's hopes of a record fifth and
third successive Milan indoor title by beating the German 7-5, 5-7, 7-6
in yesterday's final.
However, Becker contributed significantly to his own downfall with two
double faults in the decisive final tie-break, including one on match
point that allowed the No.5 seed from Russian to clinch the tournament
without hitting a return.
''It was the first time I played Becker, and it was an important
final. It was not easy to control my nerves,'' said Kafelnikov, after
having made the tie-break 8-6 to end a match which spanned two hours 15
minutes.
World No.3 Becker, later involved in the doubles final, combined
brilliance with silly errors on his backhand. He also mixed 10 double
faults with 25 aces.
The three-times Wimbledon champion, forced to play more than six hours
of singles and doubles on Saturday, had trouble getting started but
closed out the second game in style with three straight aces.
World No.10 Kafelnikov, likely to move up to No.7 with this win,
refused to bend, however, and broke the German twice to move to 5-2
before Becker dragged him back to 5-5.
But the 27-year-old almost gave the set away with a series of costly
mistakes in the final game, including three unforced errors and a double
fault, only to bounce back to take the second set by a similar margin.

this stage last year, and Marshall will be looking for better than
Saturday's straight-sets defeat from defending champion Andy Thomson.

at this same Preston in September, eased through to the quarter-finals
yesterday with a three sets to one win over Australia's Ian Taylor.

LIZ McColgan's belief that she is close to retrieving her former
powers was enhanced by a stirring performance in the Gasparilla 15,000
metres road race in Tampa, Florida, on Saturday, writes Doug Gillon.
McColgan, in her first world-class contest since her ill-fated 1993
London Marathon, finished just 21 seconds behind the Kenyan winner,
Delilah Asiago, and seven seconds behind another Kenyan, last year's New
York Marathon winner, Tecla Loroupe.
Asiago, the former world junior record holder at 10,000m, clocked
48min.38sec., against the course record of 47-43, which McColgan set in
1989.
''But that was a much cooler day. On Saturday it was 80 degress, and
100% humidity,'' said McColgan. ''I am really encouraged. I ran
conservatively, since I am not race fit. But virtually nobody was
missing from this field.
''I didn't want to take risks, but felt very strong -- another half
mile, and I would have caught the winner.'' The Scot covered the final
mile faster than anybody, in 5-07.
Since the injuries which threatened her career, and put her off the
road for 18 months, McColgan has raced just four times. ''But this was
by far the best field Liz has raced against in almost two years,'' said
husband Peter. ''It shows she is well on course for a good marathon in
London.''
Those to finish behind McColgan included Olympic marathon champion
Valentina Yegorova (Russia), the American World Student Games 10,000m
champion Anne Marie Letko (also third in New York behind Laroupe), and
Brazilian 10k champion Carmen d'Oliviera.
Germany's Uta Pippig, winner of several international marathons,
including New York and Berlin, dropped out.
McColgan, contractually committed to the London Marathon on April 2,
races the 10,000m Citrus Bowl event, where she twice set a world record,
a fortnight on Sunday.
The men's race in Tampa was won by Kenya's Josephat Machuka in 42-37.
Former Scottish cross-country champion Peter McColgan was eighteenth in
45-50.

JUST 19-years old, and competing in his first Scottish senior
championships, Scott McDermott repelled a Viking assault on the national
indoor heptathlon title at the Kelvin Hall yesterday, writes Doug
Gillon.
McDermott, from East Kilbride, could not believe his good fortune
after a dramatic finale to the two-day contest.
Favourite Anthony Brannen, attacking the UK record, was eliminated,
failing to record a distance in the long-jump. Then Swede, Andreas
Olsson, a 21-year-old physiotherapy student, built a 65-point lead
before the last event. He had to hold McDermott to 6.5sec. to win, but
the Scot blistered around, clocking 2min.50.85sec., winning overall by
51 points.
A special cheer was reserved for 53-year-old John Freebairn, fourth in
the veteran event. He was just 20 when he finished third UK competitor
in the 1958 British decathlon championships. ''I was told I would get a
British vest, but was offered terms to play in goals for Partick
Thistle, and needed the money,'' said Frebairn.
When amnesty was offered to pros in 1986, Freebairn grabbed it, and
set a British 50-plus record for the heptathlon.
This was his first heptathlon in more than a year, after prostate
surgery. ''My performances have been pathetic here, but I just love
competition,'' he said.
Emma Lindsay, ninth in the Commonwealth Games, took the senior women's
pentathlon title for the second time, and improvements in the technical
events, on which she has been concentrating, suggest she can step up the
UK rankings outdoors this summer. Results:
Women. Seniors -- 1, E Lindsay (Edinburgh Woollen Mill: 60m hurdles

AGE has not wearied him, as Linford Christie proved last night with a
world indoor 200 metres record at 34, but he may be condemned by
Britain's fans if he insists on missing the World Indoor Championships
in Barcelona next month.
Christie, racing in Lievin, France, achieved one of the goals which
has eluded him during a career in which he has won every title available
but had never set an individual world best.
He demolished the old mark with 20.25sec, on the track where the
previous record of 20.36 was set in 1987 by Frenchman Bruno Marie-Rose.
Signs were there to suggest something special was afoot earlier, when
he broke his own 12-month-old European 60m record by one-hundredth of a
second, with 6.47. But his 200m run is best judged by the fact that he
left Frankie and Johnny unhappy in his wake.
World and Commonwealth outdoor champion Frankie Fredericks was one
hundredth behind, while Christie's stablemate John Regis also was
upstaged, crossing the line third, in 20.42. But he was disqualified,
adjudged to have encroached on the adjacent lane.
''I just went out hard because I knew they would be closing in the
finishing straight,'' said Christie. ''I have all the titles, and now my
first world record -- so I can retire! Seriously, though, I'm still
having fun.''
Asked last week in Glasgow if he planned to race the worlds, Christie
appeared to leave the door slighty open, replying: ''Not at the
moment.'' But these are precisely the kind of performances to change his
mind.
Tony Jarrett equalled the English 60m hurdles record with 7.42;
Russian Irina Privalova broke her own European 200m record when she
clocked 22.10; and Moses Kiptanui finished two seconds off the world
3000m best with 7-37.14.
* SCOTS youngsters won six gold, five silver, and two bronze medals
and broke two Scottish records at the AAA under-20 indoor championships
in Birmingham. Ayr Seaforth's Hugh Kerr lowered his own national 400m
record, winning in 48.39sec, and Lee McConnell (City of Glasgow) raised
the high-jump mark by one centimetre, taking the under-17 title with
1.74m.
Linsey Rankine (Cumbernauld) won the under-15 high jump with 1.60m;
Bruce Robb (Pitreavie) took the under-20 shot (14.38m); and Des Roache
(Clydesdale) won the under-20 1500m (3-57.06), with Andy Young (Victoria
Park) runner-up in 4-3.68. Young was also runner-up 24 hours earlier in
the 800m, with a personal best of 1-53.38.
Alison Curbishley (EWM) won the under-20 400m in 54.43, with
Aberdeen's Susan Hendry second in 56.24. Silver medals went to Paul
Elliott (Avonside) in the under-17 800m (1-58.63), and Ross Baillie
(Victoria Park) in the under-20 60m hurdles with 8.17. Baillie's young
brother, Chris, took bronze in the under-15 60m hurdles (9.03), while
Tom Yule (Kilbarchan) was third in the under-17 1500m with 4-16.64.

FEUDING Paisley Pirates disobeyed their coach's instructions in a
rough-house against Chelmsford Chieftains.
Coach Martin Shields had ordered the players to cool it during the
run-in to the promotion play-offs.
But four players were thrown out of the game -- two from each side --
as promotion pushing Paisley eventually cut down the Chieftains by 17-2.
The aggro was mainly confined to the first period when Chieftains' top
marksman Dave Flannigan and his colleague Mark Norfolk, plus Dean Smith
and Dave Rook of Paisley, had early baths.
More than 120 ''sin bin'' minutes were logged in the game, but
Lithuanian Danuse Bauba went nap for Paisley and he also set up five
other goals.
Captain Mike Bettens hit four and Alex Kulikov a hat-trick. Kulikov
also had assists in eight other goals.
Edinburgh Racers star Tony Hand inspired his side to a 9-8 victory
away to Basingstoke Beavers.
The Great Britain hot-shot pounced with less than two minutes left of
a see-saw shoot-out to snatch the game winner after Racers had been 2-4
down mid-way through the match.
The goal was Hand's fifth and he also set up six other strikes for his
capital colleagues.
Fife Flyers slipped to their second defeat in a row when they crashed
5-3 at Premier Division bottom-markers Bracknell Bees.
The Kirkcaldy club were level at 3-3 going into the final stanza, but
the basement Bees stung the Flyers with two late goals.
Struggling Dumfries Vikings' sad season continued when they were
thumped 3-14 at home to Solihull Barons, the south of Scotland club's
29th defeat in 36 games. Results:
Saturday: Premier Division: Basingstoke 8, Edinburgh 9; Bracknell 5,
Fife 3; Durham 9, Humberside 5; Milton Keynes 3, Cardiff 7; Nottingham
6, Whitley 0; Sheffield 11, Peterborough 2.
Division One: Dumfries 3, Solihull 14; Paisley 17, Chelmsford 2;
Slough 15, Blackburn 3; Telford 5, Swindon 3.

TOM Dyer's Chief Minister quicken away in impressive style to land the
main hurdle race at Newcastle on Saturday, after another Scottish
trained runner, Attadale, found top weight too much.
Both now are due to run at the Cheltenham Festival, and on Saturday's
showing, Dyer's runner could be among the honours.
He had only previously raced over two miles, winning on three
occasions last season, and again at Newcastle in October when successful
in a three-runner handicap.
After having run third to Atours in November, jockey Peter Hobbs
suggested Chief Minister might be better over an extra half mile. His
trainer took the advice and also gave his charge a break.
And both decisions proved correct. Hobbs gave up mounts at Nottingham
to come to Newcastle for the first time, and he timed his challenge to
perfection.
Native Worth led into the straight, but Chief Minister was well there.
Before the last Hobbs had to switch him, but after that hurdle, the
result was never in doubt, as he went past Native Worth to win by three
and a half lengths.
The winner will be re-assessed before running in the Coral Hurdle at
the Festival, and his trainer is hoping for ''no more than seven
pounds.''
Attadale, trained by Len Lungo, stayed on. In the rear for most of the
race, Tim Reed brought him around the outside, but the weight was always
going to be too much.
The son of Ardross, who won three races on the trot last season, still
is on course for the Gold Card Hurdle over three and a quarter miles at
Cheltenham.
However, Lungo did not go home empty handed, because his Forbidden
Time landed the novices hurdle, giving the trainer his eighteenth winner
of the season.
Attention today switches to Edinburgh where Adrian Maguire will be
hoping to find winners to help him overtake Richard Dunwoody in the jump
jockeys' title race.
Dunwoody returns to action today at Fontwell after having served a
30-day suspension. He was down to ride at the Scottish track and
Fontwell but has chosen to stay in the South.

MIM may have had a disappointing season on the domestic front,
finishing runners-up in the cup and third in the National Indoor League,
but they proved at Meadowbank yesterday that they have not lost the
winning touch on the international arena.
They went into the final of the Hamilton Rentals European Indoor Cup
very much the underdogs for their game with the classy Swedish side
Stockholm, but after a tremendous contest emerged 8-7 victors in what
will undoubtedly go down as the most enthralling final ever in the B
division of the event.
The scottish side were five times two goals in arrears and on six
occasions managed to cut the deficit to a single goal before drawing
level at 4-4 and 7-7.
It was after the second time they forced equality with a corner
conversion by Gavin Markham that the captivated audience finally came to
believe that they could get the verdict with just four minutes left to
play.
Then Markham hit the post but within 60 seconds Joe Crawford, their
Australian defender, made a surge from deep inside his own half and
managed to hit the target to give the Edinburgh men the lead for the
first time in the game.
Markham should have finished the game shortly afterwards, but in the
dying seconds it was Andrew Wright who emerged as the team's hero. He
made a brilliant save from Rickard Svensson, who had earlier beaten him
on three occasions, but in making his fourth brilliant save of the
match, Wright eventually convinced his colleagues that they could win
their second European medal.
MIM captured bronze in the first-ever championship in 1990, but while
the company may not have been as distinguished as in Amiens, France, on
that occasion, this was certainly a much more courageous performance.
MIM got their taste of glory thanks to a 5-3 victory over arch rivals
St Albans of England in the semi-final. In that encounter they went two
behind after just two minutes from scores by Ben Cope, but with the help
of scores from Alan Hay (2) and one each from Jonanthan Smyth, Markham
and Englishman John Roberts, they built up an unassailable 5-2
advantage. Andy Halliday, St Albans' great servant over the years
playing possibly in his last European Championship, scored their third
goal when he converted a corner which was not defended by the Scots with
any great conviction. Results:
Hamilton Rentnals European Indoor Club Champioanship: Semi-finals: MIM
5, St Albans 3: Stockholm 13, Olten 7. Places 5/8: Avoca Mazda 11,
Jedinstvo 5; Royal White Star 7, Raca 2. Places 7/8: Jedinstvo 9, Raca
6; Places 5/6: Avoca Mazda 4, Royal White Star 4 (Avoca won 4-1 on

BRIDGE of Allan's Graeme Darlington and Manchester-based Scot Julia
Taylor won the first junior ranking tournament of the year when they
lifted the singles titles at the Marshalls Scottish 18-and-under indoor
championships at the Gannochy Centre in Stirling yesterday.
Darlington, 17, who is in the third year of a tennis scholarship at
Millfield School in Somerset, dropped a handful of games in three
matches to reach the semi-final where he dismissed defending champion
Phil Hodson from Wales 6-1, 6-4. His opponent in yesterday's final was
his schoolmate and doubles partner Jamie Bartlett, who had accounted for
Scottish 16 and under champion Jonathan Pankhurst in the last four.
Darlington made a promising start but was left to rue missed chances
when he failed to convert a break point in the fifth and another three
in the seventh as the 17-year-old Devonian hit back from 1-3 to take the
next four games and finally pocketed the set 6-4 in 53 minutes.
Bartlett found himself 3-1 down in the second set but looked to have
the match within his grasp as he took the next three games and led 40-15
in the eighth. But Darlington began a remarkable recovery and reeled off
nine successive games for a 4-6, 6-4, 6-0 victory.
Taylor confirmed her superiority in the girls event when she lifted
the title for the third time in four years, dropping a meagre nine games
in four matches. Nicola Payne, who dismissed second seed Lyndsay Reilly
in a gruelling three set semi-final, provided Taylor with her toughest
opposition but could not match the left hander's baseline consistency
and went down 6-4, 6-0. Results:
Girls' singles semi-final -- J Taylor (Bramhall) beat I Orsi
(Clarkston) 6-3, 6-0; N Payne (Tayport) beat L Reilly (Thistle) 6-3,
2-6, 6-2. Final -- Taylor beat Payne 6-4, 6-0. Boys' singles semi-final
-- J Bartlett (Devon) beat J Pankhurst (Kingussie) 6-3, 6-4; G
Darlington (Bridge of Allan) beat P Hodson (Wales) 6-1, 6-4. Final --
Darlington beat Bartlett 4-6, 6-4, 6-0. Girls' doubles final -- Reilly
and E Stevenson (Strathgryffe) beat Payne and Orsi 6-3, 6-2. Boys'
doubles final -- Bartlett and Darlington beat Hodson and P Dinsdale
(Wales) 6-1, 6-3.

CANADIAN Chris Palmer hit four goals as Edinburgh Racers beat Milton
Keynes Kings 10-8 last night. Ivan Matulik also shared in the goal spree
with a hat trick, and club captain Tony Hand hit a double.
But Tony's older brother Paul was thrown out after a flare-up three
seconds from the end of the second period.
Elsewhere, Fife Flyers, who had lost two games in a row, halted the
disappointing sequence with a 6-6 draw at Peterborough Pirates.
In division one, Paisley Pirates hammered their Scots rivals Dumfries
Vikings 14-6 at the Ice Bowl. Former Viking Bobby Haig scored four goals
in his first game back at Dumfries since his controversial move to
Paisley. Pirates' captain Mike Bettens scored a hat trick for the
Paisley outfit while American Sniper Doug Smith hit three for lowly
Vikings.
On Saturday, feuding Paisley Pirates had disobeyed their coach's
instructions in a rough-house against Chelmsford Chieftains.
Coach Martin Shields had ordered the players to cool it during the
run-in to the promotion play-offs.
But four players were thrown out of the game -- two from each side --
as promotion pushing Paisley eventually cut down the Chieftains by 17-2.
More than 120 sin-bin minutes were logged in the game.
Down south, Sheffield Steelers beat bottom club Bracknell Bees 7-2 to
narrow the gap between them and table-topping Nottingham Panthers to
just two points.
Panthers went down to a surprise 13-7 scoreline at Humberside Hawks.
Results:
Saturday. Premier division -- Basingstoke 8, Edinburgh 9; Bracknell 5,
Fife 3; Durham 9, Humberside 5; Milton Keynes 3, Cardiff 7; Nottingham
6, Whitley 0; Sheffield 11, Peterborough 2.
Division one -- Dumfries 3, Solihull 14; Paisley 17, Chelmsford 2;
Slough 15, Blackburn 3; Telford 5, Swindon 3.
Yesterday: Premier division -- Cardiff 8, Basingstoke 2; Humberside

JOGGING kicked it off and the health-and-fitness craze has been
gaining converts steadily. With gyms and exercise classes springing up
everywhere flat stomachs, tight bottoms, and muscle definition are
crucial -- and that's just the women. The keep young-and-beautiful
syndrome is now an integral part of modern-day society.
But it is not just aerobics and fitness centres. People who have been
playing a sport in their youth are increasingly determined to continue
participating.
In recent years there has been an explosion in the number of veterans'
events. Sometimes they are quaintly called masters events, presumably to
salve the egos of the youthfully challenged. Their popularity has
resulted in the establishment of a World Masters Games, held every four
years.
The names of Scotland's world champions are well known -- Liz
McColgan, in athletics, Stephen Hendry, in snooker, and boxer Paul Weir.
But Johnnie Barrie's is not a name that many recognise. Yet he, too, is
a gold medallist. He is typical of the unsung heroes of minority sport,
and at 60 is a prime example of what can be achieved by joining the
Masters circuit.
In badminton circles the name ''Wee Johnnie'' immediately brings a
smile to people's faces. He is the ultimate enthusiast.
Despite being one of the most popular participation sports in the
country, badminton rarely receives widespread coverage and its heroes
are not household names. Everyone has played the sport at some time,
whether in school, at a sports centre, or in the sadly depleted club
leagues.
These were clashes of Titan dimensions, played to a finish, sometimes
as late as 3am in cold halls where the lines could be round a piano, up
a wall, even along an electric pipe. The only prize was personal
satisfaction and the delights of Mars bar sandwiches and lemon meringue
pie. The teas were nearly as important as the match. Sadly, they are
largely a thing of the past.
Johnnie's introduction to the sport was as a 15-year-old in Lanark in
1950. His friends went to the Boys' Brigade badminton club but he
refused to play ''that cissy game.'' Two weeks later he was converted,
even although he played in a hall where it would have been hard to
install a table-tennis table.
His training techniques are extraordinary. The footballers who went to
Gullane with Jock Wallace and ran in the dunes may have thought they
were training hard. They didn't know Johnnie.
Not far from his native Lanark is 2335ft Tinto. To many it is a
pleasant but taxing walk to the summit; to others it's only accessible
by helicopter; but to Johnnie it was a weekly, often twice weekly, run
to the top. Sometimes he was knee-deep in snow. The hares were his pace
makers and just occasionally they beat him. His two years of National
Service in the Marines obviously left their mark.
As he says; ''Footballers train to play for 90 minutes but they've got
10 others to help them. A badminton player may train to play for 90
minutes too --but he's out there on his own.''
Naturally, because of his love of training, singles was always his
forte, often running his opponents into the ground. He won the
Lanarkshire restricted singles title 21 times, 18 of them in a row.
Dan Travers, one of Scotland's best-known players and a Commonwealth
Games gold medal winner, remembers his first encounter with Johnnie. ''I
was small and fat. I was so tired playing Johnnie that I tried to knock
the shuttle out of the court. But he would run onto the next court to
hit it back just to keep the rallies going. That's typical of him.''
Five times Johnnie was runner-up in the national championships. For
all his achievements he remains modest. His enthusiasm is shared by his
wife, Mary, and his two daughters, Ruth and Jill, who are county
players.
Instead of slowing down he has just kept going. Now he has taken his
talents to the world stage by competing in the Masters Games. He went to
the event in Copenhagen and came back with a gold medal in the over
55's. In October he headed for Brisbane to compete in the over 60s.
More than 23,000 competitors took part in 33 sports. In badminton
there were nearly 600. Yet again Johnnie emerged victorious with another
gold for his collection. He recommends the Masters circuit to anyone and
hopes to be back when it is held next in the US.
Meanwhile, he will be busy himself. From May he will be president of
thre Scottish Badminton Union, and as Travers says he is a perfect
ambassador for his sport.
A word of hope for us all: One of the medallists in Brisbane was a
101-year-old swimmer. Must dash. I'm off to the baths -- it's never too
early to start training.

THERE will be singing and dancing in the streets of Oslo at the
Stenhousemuir victory over Aberdeen in the Tennents Scottish Cup.
We assume this to be so after a quick scan of the list of kit sponsors
of the players at the Ochilview club.
The Stenhousemuir programme tells us that Tommy Steel, the two-goal
hero, receives the patronage of the ''Norwegian Film Industry, Oslo.''
'Muir appear to have a particularly active supporters club in Oslo.
A further 11 Warriors receive support kit-wise from Norway, including
John Irvine, whose backers are Las Ogsnekkerservice. (Great word
Ogsnekkerservice. Sounds almost exactly like what Stenhousemuir did to
Aberdeen).
* ON location in Strathbogie, land of whisky and shortbread, for the
Huntly-Dundee United tie, we were able to observe why our Scottish
football hooligans are a cut above those English thugs. There was a
delay to the second half at Christie Park after an incident in which a
barrier collapsed and police (and United chairman Jim McLean) were
dispatched to control the crowd.
The culprit was one fan, a Dundee United follower dressed in an Arab
head-dress, a T-shirt, a kilt, white ankle socks and trainers.
Midway in the first-half, the ball disappeared into the Dundee United
end. After some delay, a ball was thrown back on to the field. Not the
match ball, but a rather tatty substitute.
The match ball was snugly concealed up the aforementioned supporter's
kilt. Why not, all's fair in the hunt for souvenirs.
But at half-time, the fan, a touch the worse for drink, took the ball
on to the park to score a goal. It was more of an own goal as he
miskicked and had to make a hasty exit ahead of advancing coppers. It
was at that point the fans, surging foward for a better look at the fun,
caused a flimsy barrier to fall over.
Such was the low-key nature of the police containment exercise that no
efforts were made to apprehend the kilted arab who could still be seen
in the crowd clutching the match ball. Perhaps Grampian polis couldn't
get a positive ID.
* IT was a case of tempting fate for Huntly goalkeeper, John Gardiner.
''Jim McLean never gave a me a chance,'' he told the tabloids in
pre-match interviews.
John proceeded to let in two soft goals which proved to be the
difference between the teams on the day.
After the game, he could be seen going round the social club
apologising and commiserating with the fans. They would have none of it.
They are a supportive lot of supporters at Huntly, remembering that like
the best of keepers, John Gardiner can be the worst of keepers.
They preferred to recall his recent performance in a qualifying cup
game penalty shoot-out when he not only saved one, but scored a goal as
well.
* IT'S a long way from the sunny climes of Brazil and Portugal to
chilly Strathbogie, but Dundee United's skilful striker, Sergio Gomez,
showed great perseverance in difficult conditions.
But it was not to be his day. As one United fan concluded of the
Huntly defence's efforts in snuffing him out: ''Would ye look. That
fellow's only a butcher and Sergio still cannae skin him.''
Huntly's Marco de Barros has an equally exotic name and the same dark
good looks as Sergio. He showed great skills too. Have Huntly done a
Dundee United and plundered the Portuguese leagues, we asked chairman
Forbes Shand.
''No, we bought Marco from Elgin City. He lives in Lossiemouth and
works as an insurance agent. His father is Portuguese,'' replied Forbes.
* WE leave Huntly with abiding memories of two stalwart women who
perform vital functions at the club. One a white-haired lady steward in
charge of the centre section of the stand. Cheerful, but steely-eyed,
she brooked no nonsense from the occasional visiting chancer who tried
to get past her. Those ''rock steady'' chaps you encounter at other
football venues are pussycats by comparison.
Last, but not least, we must mention the lady in the supporters' club
who makes the soup. On a freezing day like Saturday, the thick hot pea
and lentil broth was a life-saver.
The soup is always on hand after matches and is free, complete with an
outsider of pan bread. They know how to treat the fans at Huntly.

THIS coming summer -- and, indeed the summer after that -- could see
the European dreams of Scotland's leading football clubs wither and die
before the domestic seasons have started. We saw it happen last year
when Rangers and Aberdeen went
We could become accustomed to watching the same bleak scenario
because, right at this moment, no one seems prepared to do anything to
help the clubs who will be involved.
The view of the Scottish League Management Committee is simple. Only a
handful of clubs are in Europe each season, so why change the fixtures
around for a few?
League secretary Peter Donald was at pains to point out the other day
that the members of the committee who represent the major clubs -- those
most likely to be in Europe -- had agreed on the fixture farce which
stop-starts the Scottish season in August.
By the time the premier division clubs play their first League
fixture, which is scheduled for August 26, clubs could already be out of
the Continental competitions, while the national team might have
confirmation that our players will be frustrated spectators at the
European Championships.
The official opening to the bright, new season is August 6 when the
fans will be handed the delights of the first round games in the Coca
Cola Cup between teams from the lower divisions.
A week later, the Saturday will be free of premier matches because
Scotland play Greece at Hampden the following midweek
Move on another week, and it's the Coca Cola Cup once more with the
big guns in -- but with Europe looming as a follow-up in midweek, they
could be reluctant performers that day!
Then, at last, the season really does get under way. But, for some of
the top teams, that opening day could become an anti-climax already
scarred by recriminations over European defeats.
Peter Donald says: ''There was a serious problem over the fixtures for
the start of the season. We have the Coca Cola Cup matches to be played.
As well as that, we promised the international team manager a free
Saturday before the Greek game.
There was very little room left for manoeuvre, and because the
majority of clubs do not play in Europe, it was decided that there was
really nothing we could do to help those who will be playing.''
Those clubs in Europe next season, therefore, are left to make their
own arrangements despite the fact they are representing this nation and
attempting to ensure there is a future in these prestigious tournaments
for other sides in future years.
For, make no mistake, if the poor results continue over a lengthy
period of time, then the champions will not be in the European Cup at
all and our numbers in the UEFA Cup won't be increased. That is a very
real danger which has to be addressed.
It has to be looked at by our own legislators first of all, because
the European dates for the next two seasons are already fixed by UEFA.
Something has to be done to assist the clubs, to allow them the chance
of competitive games before beginning their challenge on the Continent.
Then, it has to be examined by the European Union, too, because clubs
are being placed at a disadvantage, some of them being asked to play
before their own season has begun against teams who have been playing
regularly for some time.
Last season, Rangers suffered most of all. Missing out on the
Champions' League after making expensive investments in the Danish star,
Brian Laudrup, and French defender Basile Boli was a cruel blow.
This year they will be asked to walk the same tightrope. No doubt
Walter Smith will enter the transfer market in the summer to further
strengthen his squad.
Before the new players can be bedded down properly, they will be
pitch-forked into one of the European tournaments -- at the moment it
looks like being the European Cup again -- without the chance to add the
edge to their game that only genuinely competitive matches can provide.
The Rangers manager believes that UEFA should standardise the playing
seasons in EVERY country just as they are trying to insist that every
major League championship should consist of 36 games.
He also reckons that another look should be taken at the demands made
by international sides. Rangers, for example, lost the talents of
Laudrup for what was essentially a friendly tournament in Saudi Arabia
in December.
Smith would like some method to be found of specifying exactly when
players MUST be released and when a club can keep them.
Interestingly, enough, Ajax players are currently refusing to play for
Holland in a friendly, maintaining that their club commitments are more
important.
It will be interesting to see if our top clubs may find European
success a little more enticing than a Coca Cola Cup tie when August
comes around. I have a suspicion that shadow teams could take part in
the domestic game which would be played just a few days before vital
matches in the three major Continental competitions.

THE very welcome launch of sports letters columns should make us
reflect on how extraordinary their absence has been till now.
Scottish newspaper readers have been able to pontificate and often
bore us rigid with their diatribes on every other subject -- including
English grammar, endless constitutional squabbles, and obscure points of
Kirk doctrine. Nor is being insane any barrier to publication: quite the
reverse. Yet, though thousands of people are knowledgeable about and
keenly interested in sport, correspondence columns have either ignored
the topic (not of proper importance?), offered a few paltry lines, or
insisted their sporting hacks add some wisecracking riposte each time:
''Better watch your back, Bluenose!'' Even phone-ins often treat callers
like morons, or cut them off with a joke after the first sentence.
This is not just about social and intellectual snobbery. It's also
been another symptom of how the paying public has been excluded from
frank speaking and real influence over an industry still in the grip of
several varieties of elitism. They can complain to each other endlessly
in the pub, but may not be heard in the circles that matter. This is not
surprising in football, where even well-paid players, as their advocates
have been pointing out, are still treated like chattels. But to take
another example: behind the welcome, belated action of some local
authorities against golf or bowling clubs that discriminate against
women lay many years of grievance by thousands of grassroots women
players. Yet how often had their voices been heard in print?
Let's hope these columns succeed in delivering even a few
earth-tremors under our sporting edifices.

I AM writing to express my disappointment in the lowering of the
standard of your sports coverage. I really did not expect to see such
obvious prejudice printed in a quality paper such as yours.
I refer to James Traynor's recent report of Rangers 1-1 draw at Ibrox
with Dundee United. Nothing wrong with his actual reporting of the game,
you understand, but he seems to have an attitude problem where the
Tayside team's manager is concerned. I might have expected such sniping
from the tabloid football writers but it now seems that racism is
spreading. Fortunately, however, it seems to be contained within
Strathclyde Region.
By coincidence, as Mr Traynor was airing his anti-foreigner
sentiments, I was at Tannadice to interview the object of your
correspondent's vitriol. Ivan Golac is an articulate and intelligent man
and in an interview lasting approximately an hour I had no difficulty
whatsoever understanding him.
I can only conclude that Mr Traynor either needs to have his ears
syringed or, more seriously, was aggrieved with the result and needed an
excuse to pick on Mr Golac since he could not find fault with the
performance of his team. He probably still carries a grudge for last
year's Cup Final too. Funny, I thought journalists were supposed to be
impartial.
Mr Golac has been in this country a year and a half. For goodness
sake, surely by now his accent has lost its novelty value. Please, Mr
Traynor, try to keep your football allegiance and your prejudice to
yourself and help to maintain your paper's standard as a quality
Scottish broadsheet.

IT is interesting to observe Germany's treatment of an errant
footballer compared to Scotland's.
Stefen Effenberg was sent home in disgrace from World Cup 94 and told
he would never for Germany again. After a cooling-off period, it has now
been intimated by the German manager that there is a way back into the
national side for Effenberg.
Now contrast this with Scotland's treatment of Richard Gough. His
''crime'' no way compared to that of Effenberg's. And yet Craig Brown is
unwilling to have him back despite Gough offering an olive branch.
If Germany, easily the most successful European national side ever
with a host of talented players already at their disposal, can consider
having Effenberg back, how can Brown continue to ignore Richard Gough.
Are we so well endowed with talent that we can do without a player of
this class?
Euro 96 is in England and it is a must that Scotland qualify. Our
failure to qualify for the world Cup in 1966 is still a huge
disappointment for the Tartan Army and events at Wembley in 1967 only
highlighted what could have been.
Come on Craig Brown, bury the hatchet and allow all of Scotland to
back the national team. Bring back Richard Gough.

I WRITE with reference to a letter in your column of February 13 which
drew comparison between the Celtic side of the late sixties and the
present Rangers side. Whilst I must agree that Rangers do not produce
consistently scintillating performances, it must not be forgotten that
the demands on today's professionals are much greater than 30 years ago.
Teams are far better organised and fitness levels higher. The days of
running a team into the ground and scoring goals late on are long gone.
Rangers have proved on occasion this season what they are capable of
-- one need look no further than the last Old Firm game at Hampden, a
performance which the writer of the letter in question has perhaps
conveniently forgotten.
It is an abiding regret of mine that the majority of Scottish football
fans, both educated and otherwise, prefer to snipe at the comparative
shortcomings of the reigning Champions rather than extole the virtues of
their own teams.

THE first thing you have to learn about so-called minority sports is
that they are not that minority. I have told you this before.
Though perhaps a mere 2000 players are regulars in Scotland, it is
reckoned that the U K has nearly 50,000 active participants in
volleyball.
A smashing game it is. Sadly it is rarely publicised or even less
televised -- it is possible that the game is too fast for effective TV
coverage -- and even more it is a game which, no matter how popular
throughout the rest of the world, certainly because it can cover both
sexes and all generations, yet struggles a little in Britain.
Saturday saw no reason why this should be so, as the Wishaw Sports
Centre housed the Scottish Cup men and women's semi-finals.
There was a lot of sponsorship about. The Royal Bank of Scotland has
tied itself well to this sport, and many another sponsor is in evidence,
not the least being the redoubtable Glasgow District Council (through
the admirable parks and recreation department), which shoved out perhaps
about 15 grand this year for the City of Glasgow Ragazzi men's team.
The efforts paid off, for the Ragazzi will be in the final, having
beaten Blantyre, the final to be held at the end of May.
Ragazzi, a legendary side, coached by Tommy Dowens -- also national
coach to boot and a PE teacher at Shawlands Academy in Glasgow -- will
meet Kilmarnock, who beat by three sets to one a second-team side from
MCA Cardinals of Bellshill.
This was a considerable achievement for the Bellshill lads and the
second set lasted, for heaven's sake, 41 minutes, which just shows that
Lanarkshire chaps don't give up easily.
But this was the men's game. The girls' semi-finals showed more
glamour, really, and I don't just mean more beautiful.
For a start there was a certain inevitability about Glasgow Ragazzi
men's team.
They have GB captain Iain Grubb at the helm, and a lovely player from
Greenock who goes by the unlikely name of Imorfe Bowes, and a setter,
(the linchpin of a volleyball team, the one who starts it all off),
called Kenny Milne, who is widely respected, and a new lad who is going
to shoot lightning through the sky, Gary McGuire, only 19, who can
outjump Nijinsky.
Mind you, when Kilmarnock meet the Glasgow lads, the Ayrshire side
will have the experience of ex-Scotland captain Allan Thomas and a new
star, Gordon Welsh, as strengths.
But the real excitement at the finals will be the girls.
For what a tournament this semi was for the lassies! MCA Powerhouse
Cardinals' girls won easily against a good, but young, Hazelhead,
(Aberdeen) team.
At three-nil, the Lanarkshire lasses scored 15-4, 15-4, and, a close
finish, 17-16.
The result did not bely the abilities but it belied the talent.
The vastly experienced Bellshill club -- they have won the last three
national finals and appeared in the last six, and their captain, Linda
McNaughton, has been playing for 23 years and possesses 27 Scottish
caps.
Contrast that with Aberdeen's Hazelhead team of girls, most -- or many
-- of whom are Aberdeen Yooni students.
I spoke to their coach, Bernie Hube, a university lecturer in biology,
who until recently played for the well-quoted Bon Accord men's team.
''We didn't play at our best but we have so much talent from the
younger girls coming through. I am very confident of the future...''
He has every right to be.
I watched the 18-year-old Jade Douglas. A very tall girl, she lacks a
certain experience at top level but it will not be long before she
commands a place in the Scottish squad.
The victors though, Powerhouse Cardinals, will be playing in the final
against another set of young girls, for the winning girls' team in the
other semi was Rucanor Jets from Edinburgh, again very much a university
side.
The Edinburgh girls have as their setter the 19-year-old Aileen
Lawson, a student at Heriot-Watt, and ex-resident of South Queensferry.
She is very young, indeed, to take such an awesome responsibilty, but
Jets coach Rona Brodie, of Teamsport -- she is in charge of 11 different
sports and also sports development for the disabled in Scotland, and
that is awesome -- says that young Aileen is such a prospect she expects
the capital's side to win. They a' say that, but.
Said Bellshill coach Vince Krawczyk (don't worry, he comes frae
Scotland): ''We have the strength in the west of Scotland.''
And they do in volleyball.
Bellshill lost three star players last year -- and replaced them in
seconds.
The west can draw on the reserves from the Glasgow schools. Shawlands
Academy, King's Park, St Ninian's, Holyrood; the South-Side of Glasgow
is very strong in the schools. Marr College in Troon throws up stars
every year, mainly through the efforts of the amazing Jess Reid, PE
teacher there for years, who has turned Marr College into a veritable
hotbed of the game.
But it takes more than enthusiasm, it takes commitment.
A year ago I reported on young Gillian Lyall. She broke a leg at
girls' footy last year and I told you about it.
This year she was playing first-team volleyball. Eat yer heart out,
Ally McCoist.

JOHN Jeffrey, Iain Anderson, Bill Johnstone and I were having our
Saturday morning coffee in Montmartre, quietly contemplating the day
ahead, when a passing seagull defecated on JJ's blond mop.
''Yes!'' shouted JJ. ''In Kelso that signifies good luck, we're going
to win today.'' I said I hoped it was in Paris too.
From then on really, the result was never in doubt. Hang on, wait a
minute, to be perfectly honest, nobody believed that the Scots could
win. I didn't, JJ didn't, no-one did. And the team stuffed it right up
our jacksies good and proper.
Even Afeta Dali, the Ivory Coast captain, who I had talked to at the
French training camp on Thursday, thought that Scotland would be beaten,
and he even went further. ''We are in the same group in the World Cup as
Scotland and France,'' he said, ''and we genuinely think that we will
beat Scotland in South Africa. Many of our players play in France, so we
are of a high standard, and we have identified Scotland as the team we
have to beat, and we will. We only have 5000 rugby players in our
country, but we will win.''
On to the game itself, Kenny Logan explained what had happened
tactically. ''We knew they would try to play the game wide, so we had a
one out defence right from the start,'' he said. ''What was strange was
that they never changed their attacking ploys. We marked the man outside
us in the backs, left them no space on the outside, and the back row was
to take anything that cut back inside. It worked.'' This Scottish back
row is a machine.
I agree. The French were tactically naive, blatantly advertising the
fact that they were going to play the game to their wings.
''It is my credo,'' said Berbezier ''I want us to be an attractive
team on every pitch in the world.'' Anything you do time and again can
be chalked off the list of threats, and I, for one, was bamboozled to
see a French back division shovelling the ball wide, drifting with the
pass at the same time, like an English back division of the late
seventies.
France never tried to squash the Scots up front. There were few
rolling mauls to pulverise the Scots close, and even fewer mini rucks,
their speciality, when a dangerous runner comes from behind the scrum
half and heads open from the previous breakdown.
No, it was shovel, shovel, shovel it out wide. And it was beautifully
defended.
After the game I pondered a while, a mile up in the stadium.
Think of all the great Scottish players of the last 26 years, and
remember that not one of them had done what that team did on Saturday. I
am still trying to come to terms with the result, to rationalise it, to
believe it.
I worship the very earth that this team walks on. I grovel at their
feet, and at the feet of their coaches.
''John,'' said Grigor Stirling, the Rugby Special producer, with a
strange look in his eye ''Now that the boys have won, can you stay on
and do the post-match stuff at the team's hotel?'' No hotel room, no
money, no clothes, but we got there in the end.
On one side of the room Gavin Hastings was leading a gaggle of
supporters in various verses of ''Running Bear''. It was party time, and
after the interviews were done it was time to find a bed for the night.
''John Beattie,'' said a six-foot hulk of Melrose farmer, ''I've got a
twin room, share with me if you want.''
Aargh. I've slagged Doddie Weir off before so it was panic stations.
Into the room, and Doddie went bananas on the telephone, calling his
brother, Tam, at 4.30am. He dials. He is feeling mischievous ''Tam,'' he
says when his brother picks up the other end, ''what kind of a bloody
time of night is this to be answering the telephone?''
In the morning I look around at the team. Hungover every man jack of
them. By Monday they will have gone back to their day jobs, the day of
triumph a sweet memory, but a memory none the less.
I look at Morgan, a man who does it all for nothing, and I see him
smile like I have never seen him smile before.
I compare them to footballers. Footballers can trip off to play
Finland, and come home with a win, the rugby team is constantly having
to test itself against top-class opposition, and yet can, as it did on
Saturday, come up with something that, I think, made the nation have a
little smile to itself.
That team on Saturday, and its coaches, was a credit to its country.
So much so that I now want to have Gavin Hastings' babies.

Wales 9 England 23
WELSH prop John Davies is to appeal against his 60-day suspension
following his sending off in Saturday's Five Nations Championship defeat
against England.
The front row forward was shown the red card by French official Didier
Mene after 64 minutes, for illegal use of the boot as England cast aside
their Cardiff hoodoo with a 23-9 victory to take a massive step towards
another Grand Slam.
And England flanker Ben Clarke confirmed he was the player kicked by
Neath's Davies, commenting: ''He connected with my head. I do not want
to whinge about it, but anyone who kicks another player in the head
should be sent off.''
In only England's second victory at Cardiff since 1963, wing Rory
Underwood atoned for his nightmares of 1989 and two years ago -- when
his mistakes gifted Wales victory -- to grab two second-half tries.
Welsh hopes were rocked when the injury setbacks that had bedevilled
them in recent games re-appeared as both full-back Tony Clement and wing
Nigel Walker were forced off in the early minutes of each half.
Neil Jenkins gave Wales an early boost with a sixth-minute penalty but
they were still coming to terms with the loss of Clement soon after when
England superbly controlled a rolling maul before Bath's Victor Ubogu
peeled off to dive over.
Rob Andrew converted then extended England's lead when Wales were
offside.
Jenkins and Andrew traded penalties after the interval before England
snatched a vital score, punishing a poor drop out by Jenkins. The ball
was played along the line to Underwood, who touched down at the corner.
Jenkins reduced the lead with his third penalty, but Welsh hopes of a
comeback were hit when Davies received his marching orders.
The incident turned to farce when Wales were forced to replace flanker
Hemi Taylor with Huw Williams-Jones to ensure a prop could take a place
in the front row.
That looked to be it until, with only seconds left, Underwood popped
up in the corner to score his second try of the afternoon and his
forty-second for his country.

IT was like the scene in ''Chariots of Fire'' when Eric Liddell goes
for the tape; only now it was Gavin Hastings and as he gallopped, a
strange, eerie silence swept across the Parc des Princes.
Gregor Townsend, the man who had given him the pass, had his view
partially blocked. ''It was so quiet I thought he must have dropped it
or tripped up.'' And then the roar -- a sound which reverberated round
Paris for the rest of the night, a pent-up shout that had waited 26
years to be born.
Gavin was cool. ''I still had to take the conversion and there were
all these French fellows waiting to charge at me.'' But when the whistle
went there was no holding him.
It was his idea to take the players back out on to the pitch. Not a
lap of honour, a thank you to the supporters who had supported them so
loyally.
There were tears on the terracing, and Gordon Brown -- big Broon from
Troon -- was among those with the damp eyes. ''They have a wonderful
team spirit, this squad,'' he declared. ''They really work for each
other.''
The team bus swept majestically down the Champs Elysee as little knots
of fans cheered its progress. At the Ambassador Hotel, the guests -- the
players wives and girl friends among them -- provided a reception that
no-one who saw it will ever forget.
Of course, it was Gavin's day and a poke in the eye with a sharp stick
to all those who said he was finished. But it was also Gregor Townsend's
finest international hour.
The Gala threequarter scored one try and made another -- not bad for a
lad who is supposed to be playing out of position. ''Toony', as they
call him, has had a baptism of fire in his 10 caps, often taking the
blame in defeat: we should remember he is still only 21.
Of his own try he told me: ''I managed a little half-break and Gavin
came up and carried on the move. His pass missed the support, I managed
to kick it on and the ball popped up into my hands. There was one
back-row man to beat and that was that.
''All through the game Gavin was yelling at me to have a go. He wanted
to run it from everywhere. I have no complaints about playing in the
centre as long as we are going to run the ball.
''I know it was my kick that let the French in for their second try
and I was desperate to make amends.
''That was the most enjoyable international in which I have played.''
There will be many more.
Winger Kenny Logan almost grabbed a try too, despite being held back
illegally. ''I gave Sadourny, the French full-back, a clip round the ear
and he let go. The ball just bounced awkwardly.''
The man with the second-biggest smile was Doddie Weir. The Melrose
giant arrived as a half-time replacement for Damian Cronin and
immediately set about proving his worth.
Weir, although he would be loathe to admit it, has been hurt by being
dropped. A month ago he could not even get into the A team.
''The old hunger is back. It was great to get on because my folks were
over for the game. I will play in any position Scotland ask me to.''
The other lock Stewart Campbell made a good point. ''Our fitness told
in the end, particularly up front.''
Forwards' coach Richie Dixon deserves the highest praise for
rebuilding the pack. ''You know, we have about 15 or 16 forwards now who
are good enough to be used in internationals,'' he observed.
Why Peter Wright, the most rejuventated of them all, even popped up as
a centre in one move!
There is no talk yet of Grand Slams or Triple Crowns -- Wales a week
on Saturday will present new challenges -- but it was a wonderful
weekend to be a Scot in Paris.
Eric Liddell, an international winger as well as a sprinter who won
his gold medal in the French capital back in 1924, would have been as
proud as any of us.

A TOP referee has admitted he got it wrong during last week's match
between Aberdeen and Rangers, a game marked by two penalty incidents.
Jim McCluskey, one of Scotland's seven FIFA ranked referees, said he
did not realise he had erred until he had watched the match highlights
on television the following night. ''I saw incidents differently,'' he
said.
The incidents involved Rangers' players Charlie Miller and Brian
Laudrup. Mr McCluskey dismissed both claims for penalties.
The admission was made in an interview with Mr McCluskey and four
other leading referees. It is the first time the officials have talked
openly. They offer an insight into their psyche, speak frankly about the
game, and ask for more understanding and honesty from top players.
None of the group believes making them full-time would help improve
their own standards. They point out that they are as fit as the
full-time officials in Italy. One referee asks: ''Would #1 or #100 alter
the way I see a decision? I don't think so.''
All five agree that television technology is making their jobs harder
because of the number of replays and different camera angles. ''It is as
though they are trying to prove the referee wrong all the time.''

FANTASY football, fantasy golf, and now fantasy rugby. It's fun, and
it goes something like this.
The New Zealanders want to put their World Cup stars under contract to
the Union, and then they say they want the game to go professional.
They say they will tell the International Board next month that this
is the route that they want to go down.
And then they say that it has all been a horrible misunderstanding.
Those awful chaps in the media have got the wrong end of the stick. A
misunderstanding. Understand?
The Australians, whose international players made around #15,000 a man
last season from their Wallaby Promotions set-up, say that their top
players could be on #40,000 apiece in this World Cup year. And then they
say maybe not.
The England international Mike Catt claims that when he was playing in
South Africa, he was in receipt of substantial quantities of cash. His
claims are investigated by the RFU, and the International Board says
that, once again, it has all been a dreadful misunderstanding.
Rene Bouscatel, president of the French champions Toulouse, tells the
TV folk that his players are paid something approaching #14,000 a season
and, more, that they are in receipt of a fat bonus cheque if they win.
But, no doubt, this all comes under the heading of ''legitimate
expenses''.
And now we have the absurd spectacle of an obscure Scottish player,
who chooses to live the life of a lotus-eater in France while, at the
same time, playing for the French division one side Mendelieu, about to
be subjected to a ''full-scale'' investigation by the French Federation
and the International Board because he maintains that he is paid #800 a
month by his club.
Kevin Campbell, whose only previous claim to rugby fame was that he
was once a Scotland Under-21 player and that his brother, Alister, was
Scotland's 1984 Grand Slam lock, made the mistake of speaking out.
Don't be surprised when the FFR and the Mandelieu president Francois
Perez announce that, again, it has all been a misunderstanding.
Fantasy rugby? Sadly, no. This is the state of affairs to which the
sport has been reduced as the race towards a professional game achieves
an unstoppable momentum.
But it is all bunkum. The worldwide game, or at least those parts of
it which attract the highest profile, is already professional, and one
trusts that this is exactly what the IB's ongoing investigation into
breaches of the amateurism regulations will reveal when it is presented
to the Board next month.
Benjamim Disraeli observed that the Conservative Party was a
spectacularly well-organised hypocrisy. If the IB serves up a portion of
inedible fudge when it reports next month in Bristol, then it will have
run the nineteenth century Tory party a close race in the hypocrisy
stakes.
No longer must we accept the ''bring us the proof'' dictat whenever
rugby officialdom is confronted with the spectre of professionalism.
Pay the players. But only the international players. Let them continue
with their off-field earning activities but, in addition, give them a
couple of thousand pounds apiece each time they represent their
countries.
Draw the line, though, at club level. Despite what those with vested
interests say, it is a nonsense to claim that the Scottish club game
could afford to have professionals on their books. Comparisons with
small-time professional football clubs are spurious and flawed.
Next month at its agm, the International Rugby Football Board has a
golden opportunity to end the fantasy and drag the sport back into the
real world. For the good of the game, it is an opportunity that they
cannot afford to miss.

France 21, Scotland 23
IT was historic. It was heroic. And it was Hastings. There were two
minutes left on the clock and Scotland had to score under the posts, and
put over the conversion, if they were to wipe away the memory of 26
dismal years without a victory on French soil.
Eight minutes from the end, after Saint-Andre's try had given the
French a 21-16 lead, Gavin Hastings gathered his men behind the posts.
While Lacroix was making his preparations for the unsuccessful
conversion attempt, and as the 62,000 Frenchmen in the Parc des Princes
cauldron set about premature celebration of the win they were sure was
their's by right, Hastings told his troops forcefully and directly that
he had not come all that way to lose again.
Later, the Bath prop Dave Hilton recounted the tale, still with
disbelief on his features: ''Gavin said we would get back up there and
score under the posts. Then he would convert it for the win.
''And then he went out and did it. He must have seen the video!''
The try, and the making of it, was one of those indelible moments that
will be forever burned deep into the sporting memory.
It was Gregor Townsend's misdirected touch kick which had allowed
Saint-Andre to trade passes with Sadourny before scorching over for the
French touchdown that made it 21-16.
But it was also Townsend's deft, one-handed pass which set Hastings
screeching away on his 25-metre sprint to glory. For Townsend, who had
earlier scored a virtuoso try of his own, the six minutes between the
Saint-Andre try and Hasting's match-winner represented a beatific
transformation from sinner to saint.
''When I didn't find touch I thought, 'oh no, here we go again'. But
then when I got the ball I heard Gavin screaming for the pass. I just
handed it to him and he was away. It was magnificent,'' said Townsend.
The try was greeted with scenes of unconfined joy by the large and
vociferous Scottish support. And in the presidential box, Master Peter
Philips, who was accompanying the SRU patron, the Princess Royal,
momentarily forgot regal decorum as he leapt from his seat and punched
the air in a sign of royal approval.
After the final whistle, the Scots hugged each other and even Dougie
Morgan, the normally restrained Scottish coach, rushed on to the field
to gather the captain in his outstretched arms. Hastings, beaming from
ear to ear, was the last man off the pitch. Then the Lothian and Borders
Police pipe band appeared on cue to skirl a victory salute and the
Scottish side re-appeared from the dressing-room to perform a rare but
hugely deserved lap of honour and to applaud the Scottish supporters.
Hastings said the Scottish performance had been heroic and as a
one-off match it was right up there with the 1990 Grand Slam win over
England.
''I am a very, very happy man tonight,'' he said. ''There weren't very
many people who gave us any hope but we believed that we were capable of
coming over here and winning. We never gave in and I am very proud of
this team and the spirit they have shown since we came together three
games ago.''
The team spirit which this Scottish side has shown since the wholesale
changes after the South African defeat last November is quite
remarkable. The Scotland manager, Duncan Paterson, observed that it was
a priceless commodity which had now shown itself for three victories in
succession.
''We had to win that game twice today. We weathered the storm and went
ahead and then had to fight back from behind again. Jock Stein, who was
a great hero of mine, always said that team spirit was something that
just couldn't be bought and in this side we have it in abundance,'' he
declared.
But it had all began so badly for the Scots. After only two minutes
Saint-Andre had scored the early try which the Scottish side had feared.
From a scrum inside the Scottish 22, Accoceberry and Deylaud made the
initial dent in the Scots' defence. Then, with dummy runners setting the
Scots at sixes and sevens, Lacroix chipped ahead and Saint-Andre raced
ahead of the retreating Joiner for the touchdown.
For the next 20 minutes the Scottish side was on the receiving end of
wave after wave of abortive French attacks. The tide turned when Logan
and Wainwright made inroads into French territory and then Jardine and
Wright set up a ruck from which Chalmers attempted an unsuccessful drop
goal.
Scotland, though, had the initiative now and after 21 minutes it was
Hastings who turned the game in Scotland's favour with a majestic
penalty goal from three metres inside the French half.
From the restart Scotland took up where they had left off. Campbell
gathered and the half-backs sent Hastings surging upfield. Townsend,
playing his best game by far in a Scotland jersey, made the half-break
and Hastings, Wainwright, Campbell and Wright took play deep into French
territory.
The Scots' momentum was momentarily halted but then they came again.
Redpath and Chalmers sent Jardine hammering on at pace and he threw out
a huge pass to Hastings which Sella all but intercepted. The ball went
to ground and Townsend, showing rare intuitive skills, tapped the ball
on with the boot and it bounced fortuitously to hand. Thereafter, the
Gala man, showing great pace, swept in for the try. Hastings converted
and Scotland were 5-10 to the good.
Five minutes from the interval Hastings kicked Scotland further ahead
with a penalty goal after Campbell had taken clean lineout ball and the
French, under pressure, were forced to concede the penalty.
Damian Cronin was forced to retire at half-time with an arm injury and
a rejuvenated Doddie Weir assumed his chores in line-out and scrummage.
France began the second half with renewed vigour, and Saint Andre,
Benazzi and Deylaud each had cracks at the Scottish line before Lacroix
was successful with a penalty attempt from in front of the Scottish
posts.
At this stage the Scottish defence was peerless. Time and again the
Frenchmen sallied for the line but each time the attacks were snuffed
out by brave and resolute Scottish tacklers.
After 56 minutes the French had a reward of sorts when Deylaud dropped
a goal but, once again, Scotland stormed back. An intelligent chip-kick
by Townsend gave them a platform ten metres from the French line.
Joiner, Chalmers and Redpath set up ruck ball and Hastings, the
irrepressible Wright, and Joiner forged ahead to create panic in French
ranks. They conceded an off-side penalty and Hastings goaled to make it
11-16.
The French retaliated almost immediately. From deep within Scottish
territory, Accoceberry broke blind-side right and there were three
Frenchmen queuing up to score. Sadourny sprinted for the corner flag and
despite desperate attempts to keep him at bay by Hastings and Milne, the
French fullback sneaked over for the try.
France were now level-pegging with the Scots and after 72 minutes they
took the lead. Townsend's attempted touch-finder went straight to
Saint-Andre. He handed on at pace to Sadourny before looping the
fullback and re-taking the ball and sprinting down the touchline to
touch down far out on the left. Lacroix's conversion attempt went wide
of the posts and as it did so Hastings was delivering his rallying call
to the embattled Scots.
They heeded his words well and Townsend and Joiner took play back into
enemy territory. Then came the piece-de-resistance. Townsend's break and
pass to Hastings was, as Duncan Paterson observed later, something which
cannot be coached. It was a thing of beauty and as delicate as a silk
ribbon. Hastings's try and his winning conversion was a storybook ending
to one of the great games of rugby union football. Anything is possible
now.

ELGIN City's decision to revert to a more locally-based side may have
been forced upon manager Ian Fleming, but it still produced their
biggest victory of the season on Saturday.
Despite City having plans for a #2million rebuilding of their ground,
Fleming has no money to spend on players, so veterans Bobby Glennie,
Doug Bell and Ian Porteous -- already off to Arbroath -- along with
striker Hugh McLachlan, will leave the club to save on travel expenses.
As a result, the remaining City team will comprise of younger,
local-based players. It is what is wanted by City's fans, many of whom
have stopped going to games, and after a 5-0 win over Wick Academy they
have little excuse for continuing to stay off the terraces.
Meanwhile, Aberdeen have decided not to follow up their interest in
City keeper Craig Hinchcliffe after a week's trial -- though Falkirk and
Huddersfield are still poised to move for him. Hinchcliffe had an easy
day in the win against Wick, while Duncan Ord grabbed a hat-trick at the
other end.
While champions and leaders Huntly took on Dundee United,
second-placed Peterhead's lingering title hopes were extinguished in a
1-0 derby defeat by Fraserburgh. Ian Murray got the winner.
Cove Rangers easily overcame the challenge of Fort William with a
comfortable 4-1 win, Alan Leslie scoring twice.
Ian McDougall found the net twice as Brora Rangers won 4-0 at Nairn.
Kevin Walker hit the winner for Forres four minutes from the end to
defeat Rothes 2-1.
An Ian Stewart hat-trick eased Lossiemouth into the semi finals of the
North Cup against Clach. The second round replay went to extra time
before Lossie stepped up a gear.

St Johnstone 3, Hamilton Academicals 0
QUITE simply, this was a game St Johnstone just had to win.
The recent Scottish Cup exit at the hands of Stenhousemuir may now
have been put in perspective as a result of happenings at Ochilview on
Saturday but, prior to kick-off, supporters of the Perth club were
hurting badly as a result of their own team's ineptitude and anything
other than a convincing victory over Hamilton would have jeopardised
further the current tenuous relationship which exists between players
and fans.
In the end, such an objective was achieved with comparative ease.
It was from the unlikely source of full back Paul Cherry that St
Johnstone derived much of their attacking firepower. Cherry galloped
forward to join the Saints attack in a one-sided second half and marked
the occasion by scoring one goal and claiming a half share in another as
Accies succumbed to the home side's superiority.
Leading by George O'Boyle's fifth minute strike, St Johnstone sealed
victory during the course of a six minute period early in the second
half.
The second goal arrived when Cherry appeared, unmarked, in the Accies
goalmouth to nod home from Sean McAuley's cross and the third followed
soon afterwards when Isaac English, starting his first game for the
Perth side since signing from Partick, swung over a corner which was
headed goalward by the adventurous full back. O'Boyle made sure the ball
crossed the line leaving both players claiming the glory.
Accies' only threat came via the penalty spot midway through the first
half after David Lorimer had been upended. Peter Duffield, however,
crashed his effort against Alan Main's right hand post.

ENGLISH football fans -- and players -- kept their heads as requested
in the wake of the Dublin riots as eight FA Cup fifth round ties this
weekend brought only one sending off and not a single incident of crowd
trouble. Leeds left Old Trafford peaceably yesterday after a 3-1 defeat
by Manchester United, who will be at home again in the quarter-final to
Queens Park Rangers. In yesterday's other games, Newcastle beat
Manchester City 3-1 and Wimbledon held Liverpool 1-1 at Anfield.
Leeds all but gave their tie away in the opening five minutes,
allowing first Steve Bruce and then Brian McClair to head goals from
Ryan Giggs corners while defenders stood and watched. The visitors did
little more than hang on until half-time, when manager Howard Wilkinson
made a double substitution, sending on record signing Tony Yeboah, who
has not previously played more than 20 minutes of any game.
Within seven minutes, the Ghanaian had nudged the ball into an empty
net, but Mark Hughes' header from a Kanchelskis cross midway through the
second half eased United's passage.
Their pleasure was enhanced by the elimination of Manchester City,
which can only undermine manager Brian Horton's hopes of keeping his
job. Once again Horton, a low profile appointment by the previous regime
before Francis Lee took control at Maine Road, endured little luck. He
protested fiercely about Newcastle's opening goal, which would
nevertheless have been avoided if goalkeeper Andy Dibble had not tried
to sidestep Keith Gillespie. The former United winger took the ball off
him and scored.
That 3-1 scoreline was a repeat of the FA Cup final between the teams
exactly 40 years ago. At Anfield, Andy Clarke's early goal for Wimbledon
threatened a repeat of the famous 1988 final before Robbie Fowler's
first FA Cup goal, his twenty-fifth of the season, saved Liverpool.
The five ties played on Saturday had sent Everton, Queens Park Rangers
and Wolves through to the quarter-final, leaving Tottenham to replay at
Southampton and Crystal Palace to take home advantage for their replay
with Watford.
Everton's 5-0 demolition of a feeble Norwich was by a long way the
most emphatic result of the round, one which Norwich's manager John
Deehan had to admit marked the lowest point of his 13 months in charge
of the club. Even with five first team players unavailable, the
Merseyside team were two goals to the good in 24 minutes and the tie was
over when, in the 56th minute, Norwich had Jon Newsome sent off and
conceded a third goal from the resulting free kick. Duncan Ferguson and
Graham Stuart completed a rout that had Norwich's disenchanted
supporters calling for Deehan's head.
First Division Millwall, having already knocked out Arsenal and
Chelsea, were denied the chance of a hat-trick of London premiership
scalps by FIFA referee Philip Don's courageous award of a last minute
penalty to QPR. He spotted a handling offence and Clive Wilson converted
the penalty. Millwall's much-maligned supporters took defeat without
troubling the assembled mounted police.
The two outstandingly gifted performers on show at White Hart Lane
duly notched a goal each to take Tottenham and Southampton to a replay,
Matthew Le Tissier's penalty cancelling out Jurgen Klinsmann's effort
within a minute. Irish internationalist David Kelly, even more
frustrated than Le Tissier by Wednesday's abandonment in Dublin after he
had scored, took it all out on Leicester, his goal carrying Graham
Taylor's Wolves team into the last eight.

MANCHESTER United's chances of an unprecedented second successive
English league and cup double improved yesterday after they beat Leeds
United at Old Trafford in the FA Cup fifth round and were handed a
quarter-final tie at home to Queen's Park Rangers. United have already
beaten the London side twice this season in the premiership, in which
they currently trail Blackburn by two points.
In the only other clear cut sixth round tie, Everton are at home to
Newcastle. When the teams met in the league two weeks ago, Everton had
two players sent off and seven booked in a 2-0 defeat, but with former
Rangers striker Duncan Ferguson in fine form, they are a force again at
Goodison Park. Sixth round draw:
Liverpool or Wimbledon v Tottenham or Southampton; Everton v
Newcastle; Watford or Crystal Palace v Wolves; Manchester United v
Queen's Park Rangers.

A TEAM with eight wins and now 29 goals on their own ground would seem
to have little to complain about in respect of their home record, but
Dumbarton had reasons for disappointment at Saturday's 2-2 home draw
against Clyde.
Manager Murdo MacLeod was hoping that the Sons would move to within a
point of Stenhousemuir at the top of the Second Division but missed
chances prevented them from collecting the three points on offer.
These are the two highest scoring teams in the division and the crowd
of 1200 had only 16 minutes to wait before the home side opened the
scoring from a Paul Martin free kick. An Ian Angus penalty brought
equality midway in the half, but Martin Mooney's eleventh goal of the
season restored the home lead five minutes before the break.
The cost of missed chances was brought home to Dumbarton 17 minutes
from time when Gordon Parks tapped in Clyde's second equaliser.
Dumbarton should not consider that they have an easy task to make
amends by picking up the three points next weekend, when they visit
bottom club Brechin City.
The Angus team showed that they do not intend to be the division's
whipping boys any longer by snatching a 1-0 win at Dumfries on Saturday.
This was only their second away victory and, considering that Gavin
Price's goal was only their fifth away from home in 12 outings, it is
obvious why they have made so many pointless journeys.
Brechin would consider that a visit to the third bottom side was one
of their best chances to secure an away win but, equally, this was a
golden opportunity for Queen of the South to attach themselves to the
fringe of the promotion race.
Instead, defeat was an unmitigated disaster for Billy McLaren's team.
Promotion is now a forlorn hope, with 11 points separating them from
second placed Dumbarton, and the only thing which can keep their season
alive is the unwanted continuing threat of relegation, as Queens remain
only six points above Meadowbank.
Towns like Dumfries deserve more success than Queens are currently
providing, and there was little on Saturday to encourage the 1000 fans
to return.
Brechin, in fact, had much of the early play and it was ironically
just when the home side were beginning to take control midway in the
second half that the visitors struck. James McKellar made a strong run
and his cross was met by Price, who headed firmly into the net.

DUTCH FA president Jos Staatsen last night threatened to have Ajax
banned from European competition.
His hard-line stance came as the row over the refusal of Ajax to
release nine of their players for Wednesday's friendly against Portugal
escalated, bringing the country to the brink of yet another
self-inflicted crisis.
Staatsen revealed that UEFA had also been asked to ban Ajax playing
friendly games in Greece, where they are preparing for next month's
Champions Cup quarter-final against Hajduk Split.
Accusing the Amsterdam club of acting arrogantly, Staatsen insisted:
''The reasons for the players not joining the national team are
bull-shit.
''The question now is whether any of their players will be called upon
again this season. It is also being considered having Ajax withdrawn
from Europe next season because of their behaviour. They have trampled
the national jerseys in the mud.''
Ajax had maintained that their priority was the Champions Cup, which
their magnificent young side is favourites to win.
Their coach Louis van Gaal retorted: ''This is entirely the FA's
fault.
''They signed an #8m deal to play friendly games over a three-year
period.
''It was a stupid ploy, purely to make money, and now they ask us to
risk our chances of advancing in Europe by taking part in a meaningless
game.''
To cap a bleak week for Dutch football, their 1500 referees are
considering strike action after one of their members was beaten up and
severely injured by players while officiating at a non-league match.
* Hajduk Split will be without their keeper, Toni Gabric, who is out
for the season after breaking his leg in a friendly against Karlsruhe.
* FIFA has launched an investigation into Cameroon football over
falsified documents relating to one of their World Cup players, David
Embe, who participated in last summer's event in the USA.
On signing for Greek side Larissa, it was discovered that he was three
years older than he actually claimed.
When the Cameroons competed in the World Youth Cup in Australia two
years ago, suspicions were strong that several of their players were
over-age. Now Embe has apparently said that more than half the team were
too old.
If his allegations are substantiated, there could be an idefinite ban
for their coach Jules Nyonsha who was in charge during the Australian
event and sanctions against their FA.
* FIFA are currently considering making it mandatory to use only balls
approved by the world's governing body in competitive football. Such an
action would generate vast revenue.
* OTTO Rehhagel will end his 14-year association with Werder Bremen at
the end of the season when he will take charge of Bayern Munich. The
parting will be acrimonious.
Rehhagel had been criticised within the Bremen dressing room for
selecting his son Jules, who, some players stated publicly is
ill-equipped for the task. This, he said was the main reason for his
departure.
The experiment to introduce an Italian influence at Munich has not
succeeded and Giovanni Trapattoni will return home, possibly for a
second spell at Internazionale or as successor to Arrigo Saachi with the
national team.
* FRANZ Beckenbauer, vice-president at Munich, has negotiated a new
deal with Adidas, whom he represents in a PR role, worth #3m over the
next 10 years.
* BELGIUM'S oldest club, FC Liege, may fold at the end of the season
because of it's financial plight.
President Andre Marchandise admitted: ''We are #5m in debt and require
a new stadium as our present one is too old and unsafe. The position
looks hopeless.''
* GUADELOUPE have been suspended for six months after one of their
players kicked a referee and broke his leg on the African island of Sao
Tome.
The culprit, one Adelino da Costa, was fined #25 and jailed for 20
days.

THE long-suffering Albion Rovers fans had an experience other than
misery on Saturday when the team at the foot of the Third Division
gained only their second home win of the season, at the expense of
Cowdenbeath, writes Bill Sutherland.
Already new manager Jimmy Crease is stamping his own mark on the team,
who, after a first half best forgotten, ended up as good value for their
2-0 win. Crease took Berwick Rangers from the brink of oblivion to
respectability, but the Rovers are ranked No.40 among Scotland's senior
teams and it will be difficult to change that status this season.
However, those who have not seen the Rovers playing this season --
which is just about the entire population -- will not know that there
have been hopeful signs. Except in the first few weeks of the season,
they generally have not been outplayed in most of their 16 league
defeats, which have been more the result of bad luck, lack of
confidence, and self-inflicted wounds.
Crease, who watched the team's home defeat by Caley Thistle the
previous week, had a few tips for his players at Thursday's training.
''The first thing I said was that we had to stop giving away suicidal
goals,'' he revealed. ''I told the back four to take no chances and
today they played to instructions.''
Coach Joe McBride has been more involved behind the scenes since the
sacking of Tom Spence as manager, but on Saturday he was involved in the
goals, although less directly than Martin Scott.
Only 16 minutes remained when a McBride corner was not cleared
properly, Scott's overhead kick hit the bar, and defender Martin Ryan
was on hand to knock in the rebound. The points were secured five
minutes later when Scott headed in a McBride cross.
The Rovers remain seven points adrift of Arbroath, whose own revival
continues under new manager John Brogan. Ian Porteous, who scored two
goals against Queen's Park in midweek, crossed for Lee Gardiner's early
headed goal at Dingwall.
That defeat for Ross County let Forfar go five points clear when they
came from behind at Falkirk. Mungo McCallum shot East Stirlingshire
ahead midway in the second half but Alan Morgan equalised and Sandy Ross
converted a penalty.
Peter Lamont's early strike kept the points at home for Alloa against
Caley Thistle while Montrose were twice ahead but had to settle for a
point at home to Queen's Park. Headers by Derek Grant and Alan Kennedy
were equalised by Dom Callan's 20-yard strike and a David Graham corner
which home keeper Dave Larter was deemed to have carried over his own
line. Ross McFarlane, who has re-joined the Amateurs, was sent off. Was
it for a professional foul, I wonder?

Cooper
is quick
on the
draw
By HUGH McKINLAY
Airdrie 2, Dunfermline 0
STEVE Cooper is one of the growing band of Englishmen abroad in
Scotland -- and enjoying it, at that. But the striker, from Birmingham,
where sportsmen are bred with the same steel as the Midlands car
production lines, also has shown the mettle in his football career, and
he used it to great effect to help Airdrie knock Dunfermline out of the
Tennents Scottish Cup at Broadwood on Saturday.
The simple statistic is that he scored the opening goal that settled
Airdrie in a match plagued by what weathermen would have termed as a
stiff breeze, but the crowd of around 4500 would swear was a gale,
purely because of the wind-tunnel effect created by the stadium in
Cumbernauld.
Cooper's career, though, brings through the temperament of a man akin
to a television series of yesteryear -- ''Have Gun Will Travel.'' In his
case, the bullets -- 13 of them have found the target this season --
come from a set of boots which have done service with Birmingham,
Newport, Plymouth, Barnsley, Tranmere, York, and now Airdrie.
He also was happy to admit that he had been given a kick up the
nineties by being dropped for Airdrie's two previous matches. ''I've no
complaints. My form had dipped, and it was the spur I needed.''
But with Raith Rovers now beckoning in a quarter-final, Cooper could
be the envy of many younger lads who have been striving in the lower
leagues.
Since his first game when signing on from York on October 4 -- and he
scored in that victory over Ayr United -- he also has played in the
Coca-Cola Cup, when he scored against Raith before his side were knocked
out in penalties in the semi-final, and, of course, in the winning
Airdrie side who took the B&amp;Q Cup in the final against Dundee.
And let's not forget that the first division title still is well
within Airdrie's grasp.
Cooper also took time out to praise team-mate Andy Smith, who scored
the second after having come on, yet again, as substitute. ''I'm so
pleased he scored,'' said Cooper. ''I kow he's called super-sub, but I
was slightly surprised he was not on from the start today. Having said
that, I can play equally comfortably alongside Alan Lawrence.''
But while Airdrie now have a revenge mission in sight for the demise
in the Coca-Cola Cup when they visit Stark's Park on March 11,
Dunfermline were left to populate what must have been a very quiet bus
on the way back to East End Park.
Manager Bert Paton was on a high in midweek after his men had clawed
their way back to the top of the first division on goal difference. The
difference between his squad and Airdrie was more than just the goals.
And both he and assistant Dick Campbell were still trying to work out
yesterday why their side, quite simply, flopped.
Gurus from the depth of Harley Street might find it impossible to
understand why a team which should have been brimming with confidence
suddenly did not seem to want to deal with the main tool of their trade.
The ball.
Airdrie keeper John Martin joked at the question about the lack of
pressure on him during the match. ''Dunfermline were not bad, we were
just good,'' he said. Dunfermline skipper Norrie McCathie disagreed in
one respect only -- he reckoned his side were ''never at the races in
the second half.''
The aftermath for Dunfermline is much more serious than just having
been knocked out of the cup. Paton said: ''There were three bad bookings
as far as we are concerned -- Paul Smith, Ivo den Bieman, and Stewart
Petrie. That's them over the points mark, which will create problems for
us.''
Missing Jackie McNamara down the right flank because of suspension was
testimony to the problems the Fifers will face as they bid to stay top
of the league.
As in most pressure situations, some managers an show a sense of
humour. After Airdrie's midweek league defeat by Clydebank, Alex
MacDonald's opening remark on Saturday was: ''The right team turned up
today. If we had got that second goal earlier, I could have enjoyed
myself.''
Over to Paton, especially on the question of animosity between the
management teams -- assistant Dick Campbell and MacDonald seemed to have
words at one point which had the main stand linesman having to intervene
at the dugouts.
''There was no problem,'' said Paton. ''In fact, we're seeing so much
of Airdrie, we're beginning to like them.''

Kilmarnock 4, East Fife 0
NEVER set an examination, Kilmarnock passed with honours. They were
clever but canny with it. Sensibly they had taken a telling from recent
cup experience. Having made a meal of seeing off Morton in the previous
round, they declined to treat East Fife as a light snack. Instead, they
did a thorough job on them.
''A good, professional performance,'' Alex Totten, the Killie manager,
said, adding this win made seven outings without defeat.
He sounded as if he could hardly wait for the quarter-final against
Celtic. Unlike the Morton lesson, his players will not need reminding of
the history lesson behind that encounter. In the cold climate between
the clubs it promises to be a warmer. Killie showed on Saturday that
they can make much of any little bit of extra incentive.
Although the tie seemed to last a long time, it contained many good
moments.
A bright series of them were provided by the neat, unobtrusive skills
and conspicuously eager running of Steve Maskrey. His two goals, the
first and third of the game, were well taken and even better timed,
coming crucially in the middle of the first half and early in the
second.
Maskrey, however, was not so much the star of the show more a first
among equals.
In the early stages, Ally Mitchell's energy and ambition rescued
Killie's businesslike approach from being just too cautious and
sensible. A strong run by him on the left produced the makings of the
opening goal that had begun to feel late in coming.
Tom Brown's fiery pace and fierce snapping up of little chances helped
abundantly to convince East Fife that they were out of their depth.
Near the end an instinctive volley from about the corner of the
penalty area that was parried on its screaming path into a top corner of
the net will live in the memory of Rugby Park loyalists as one of the
best that got away.
Really, Killie might have had six or several more.
Of the four that counted, Mark Reilly nipped the second and Tom Black,
the fourth with a deflected free kick from 30 yards that somehow found
its way past what must have looked like more bodies than the rules allow
on the park.
Steve Archibald, the East Fife manager, picked himself to play and
helped Dougie Hope and Paul Hunter to rattle Killie briefly after the
interval.
Despite being overworked, Richard Gibb bustled well. Goalkeeper Dean
Robertson's acrobatic leap to turn aside that volley by Brown deserves
to be an enduring Methil memento. Glittering careers have started from
less.

<HEADLINE>Court to be told Gibraltar killing of IRA terrorists was human rights violation</HEADLINE>

SAS soldiers who shot dead three unarmed IRA terrorists in Gibraltar
were in violation of human rights, a court will be told today.
Lawyers representing the families of the victims, Ms Mairead Farrell,
Mr Daniel McCann, and Mr Sean Savage, will urge the Human Rights Court
in Strasbourg to overturn a Gibraltar inquest finding that the three
were lawfully killed.
The court will also be asked to reject a majority opinion from the
Human Rights Commission that the unnamed soldiers did not use excessive
violence. The hearing is the last legal stage in the long-running
''Death on the Rock'' case.
The three victims were members of an IRA active service unit and were
shot dead on Gibraltar's border with Spain in March 1988. They had been
under surveillance for several days amid fears of a terrorist attack on
the Royal Anglian Regiment carrying out the changing of the guard, a
weekly ceremony in Gibraltar.
The soldiers claimed they were forced to kill the trio because they
feared they were about to detonate explosives after noticing they were
being followed. They denied witness claims that they continued shooting
when the victims were lying on the ground.
Relatives of the victims took their case to Strasbourg after a
Gibraltar inquest jury returned majority verdicts of lawful killing, and
following a subsequent rejection of a legal claim for damages against
the Ministry of Defence.
However, they were disappointed when the Human Rights Commission
decided by 11 votes to six that the soldiers were justified in opening
fire because of the risk that the IRA members were armed and might have
a bomb.
Irish member of the Commission Ms Jane Liddy was one of the six who
disagreed with the majority decision that there had been no breach of
the Human Rights Convention which safeguards ''the right to life''.
She insisted in a ''dissenting opinion'' that the three suspects could
have been arrested without the use of lethal force. However, the
majority said there had been no premeditated plan to kill the three,
backing SAS claims that Ms Farrell and Mr McCann had made threatening
movements, and rejecting claims that the soldiers had continued shooting
when the three were either trying to surrender or lying on the ground.
The commission opinion, which is not binding on the full court, said
the shootings ''could be considered as absolutely necessary for the
legitimate aim of the defence of others from unlawful violence''.
The victims' relatives hope the court will reverse that view in its
final ruling, which will not be delivered until later this year.

MANCHESTER United legend Sir Bobby Charlton pointedly failed to give
Eric Cantona his backing during a television interview yesterday.
Cantona has been banned by United until the end of this season
following his attack on a Crystal Palace fan on January 25.
Asked by interviewer Sir David Frost on his Breakfast With Frost
programme on the BBC whether Cantona would ever play for Manchester
United again, Sir Bobby replied: ''Eric's problems can only be solved by
Eric. If he shows remorse, apologises and tries hard to change his ways
there may be a place for him in the game. But we do not want to see the
sort of things that he does continuing.''

BEHIND the scenes in the Stock Exchange a new debate is beginning. At
the heart of it is the smaller company sector and whether smaller fully
listed companies should have some form of separation from the larger
''Big Board'' companies.
Splitting the list would, Brian Winterflood champion of the smaller
companies argues, shelter them from the effects of swings in sentiment
on the derivatives market which is largely concerned with the big
companies.
Smaller -- and really tiny -- companies are already a hot topic. The
Exchange has now launched its new Alternative Investment Market (AIM)
which is intended to accommodate companies which, for one reason or
another, are not felt to be appropriate for a full listing.
The new AIM market is due to start functioning on June 19 and is
intended as a replacement for the old Unlisted Securities Market which
has already closed its doors to new entrants and is scheduled to cease
to exist at the end of next year.
The USM, which in its heyday was a great success, is going because
Brussels directives resulted in the Exchange having to relax its
requirements for full listing to the extent that the difference did not
justify having two markets any more.
At first it seemed as if the Exchange would leave it at that -- one
official list with the new easier entry requirements at the top and the
long-standing but now more heavily used special dealing facility, Rule
4.2, at the bottom.
This rule was designed to allow deals through Stock Exchange member
firms in small companies which had to do little more than persuade the
Exchange that they existed, that they could produce an audited set of
accounts and that their directors had not just stepped out of gaol.
Then it was argued that something a good deal stronger than Rule 4.2
was needed and that there should be a new mini market for the tiddlers
outside the official list.
In this there could be both market making and matched bargain dealing,
and broking firms or other expert would have some sort of responsibility
for companies but regulation would still be light and entry easier. That
will be AIM and the Exchange is spending a lot of thought, effort and
about #750,000 of promotional money to get it off the ground.
Rule 4.2 survives only to allow deals in suspended company shares.
Companies currently using it are being given the option of conforming to
the AIM rules or being traded off-market.
While all this is going on, up steps Mr Winterflood, head of
Winterflood Securities, the key market maker in smaller (less than
#300m) listed and some unlisted companies with a whole new idea.
Mr Winterflood, whose company currently deals in 1270 stocks and
intends to be a major player in AIM, wants to have smaller listed
companies viewed separately from the big ones although still traded
under the Stock Exchange umbrella. He is concerned about the ''huge
gyrations'' in prices which can be caused by events in the LIFFE futures
market affecting the FTSE indices.
He comments: ''The initial shock of seeing the screens which display
the prices of London equities turn almost completely red or blue does
have a terrible consequence on stocks far removed from the games being
played on LIFFE. It also tends to give investors palpitations. The
avalanche effect on smaller companies is very unsettling.''
Mr Winterflood makes it clear that he is not against LIFFE but he does
believe that ''international hedges and forward trades on LIFFE have a
disproportionate effect on prices of the companies lower down the list.
This puts too big a strain on a market that is so far removed from the
day-to-day activities of international speculators, hedging funds and so
on, that the only fair solution is a separation or differentiation of
markets.''

Hibernian 2, Motherwell 0
WHEN Motherwell defender Brian Martin was shown the red card during
the second half of this game at Easter Road the Fir Park club's season
had virtually ended.
Two months back, they were being touted as genuine challengers for the
premier division championship but all that ended after a disastrous run
of results. Now, the Scottish Cup has gone, too.
Martin accepted a large portion of the blame afterwards when he
admitted: ''I did use a couple of swear words when I spoke to the
linesman after their second goal.
''It was just one of these days and I got a bit frustrated. I really
did think Kevin Harper was offside when he set up the second goal but I
feel sick about what I did now.
''I know that I will be fined by the club but that's life. We played
well in the first half and were the better side. We had a chance to save
the game until I was sent off. That finished us.''
Martin, perhaps, is blaming himself too much, although television
evidence seemed to confirm what I believed at the time, that Harper was
onside when he took a pass from Darren Jackson to set up the goal.
However, I thought the game was over before Martin was sent off by
referee Hugh Dallas. It was over when Pat McGinlay scored that second
goal, the one which caused Martin to lose his temper with the linesman.
If Martin had kept quiet and remained on the field I still doubt that
the Fir Park team would have been able to stage any kind of comeback.
They had a lot of the ball when down to 10 men but didn't threaten Hibs
as they might have done if Tommy Coyne had been fit and playing.
But he wasn't and that helped make it Hibs' day, as Motherwell manager
Alex McLeish was quick to admit afterwards. Incidentally, McLeish also
claimed that Hibs could go on and end the Scottish Cup jinx which has
haunted them for almost the whole of the century.
Darren Jackson, the man who did so much to inspire this victory, hopes
to transfer his club form to the international scene tomorrow in the
Scotland B side and, then next month in Moscow with the full national
team.
Yesterday, though, he was still savouring the cup win and the
quarter-final draw which paired them with the season's giant-killers,
Stenhousemuir -- even though that will take place at Ochilview.
''We have the benefit of having been given two warnings,'' Jackson
pointed out. ''St Johnstone lost there and they are a very competent
first division side. Now, Aberdeen have gone out and no matter what
their league position is -- or what anyone says about them -- they are a
quality team.
''There is no way that we will ignore these results but, even though
the match is at their ground, we have to be looking towards a semi-final
place. This is a good draw or us.
''It certainly won't be any more difficult than the game against
Motherwell. I thought they had a good opening twenty minutes but when
Kevin scored the first goal that helped to turn the game around a little
bit.
''We were all pleased for Kevin. He suffered a bit of stick for his
miss at Hampden against Celtic the previous week. This time he showed a
great touch and smashing vision to get that opener.
''Then he picked out Pat McGinlay at the far post for the second. He
deserved all the praise he got afterwards after going through a hard
time after the last match.''
Jackson, himself, played deeper than Scotland coach Craig Brown will
probably want to use him. Later, he did admit: ''I think the manager was
looking for me to get forward a little bit more than I did. The way
things worked out during the game we had Pat getting up in support and I
sat back a little because we did worry about Motherwell catching us with
counterattacks -- something they are very good at.
''Apart from a Billy Davies shot which Jim Leighton saved
magnificently in the second half, I can't remember them bothering us too
much after we got in front.''
McLeish joined Martin in criticism of the match officials after the
game. He talked, then, about ''iffy decisions'' being made by referees
and linesmen at important matches.
There were some dodgy verdicts the referee at Easter Road but the
crucial second goal, the one which caused the Motherwell anger, didn't
fall into that category.
As well as the red card for Martin, Rob McKinnon, Jamie Dolan, Alex
Burns, and Davies collected yellow cards for Motherwell. Two Hibs' men,
Steven Tweed and McGinlay, were also cautioned.

Celtic 3, Meadowbank Th 0
THE fact that Celtic virtually strolled into the quarter finals of the
Scottish Cup by beating a side whose immediate ambition is to cling on
to second division status will hardly cause a tremor of apprehension
among the other clubs who still retain an interest in the trophy.
But Hampden on Saturday brought some relief for the lodgers from
Parkhead, and ended what had been a rather embarrassing statistic. For
the first time in the club's history Celtic had gone for more than half
a season without managing to score more than two goals in any
competitive match.
A double from Dutchman Pierre Van Hooydonk and one from Willie
Falconer in the space of 13 first half minutes ended that run, but
instead of going on to treat the fans to a scoring spree, Celtic were
soon back to frustrating ways and there was little to enthuse over
during the entire second half.
The crowd would love to have seen Van Hooydonk grab his first hat
trick in Scottish football, and he had the chances to do it, especially
when he managed to drive the ball straight at Meadowbank goalkeeper
Steve Ellison from point blank range near the end.
The Dutchman, however, is proving to be a shrwewd signing by manager
Tommy Burns. I am convinced that we will not see the best of him until
next season, when he has done all the pre-season work and got used to
the frantic pace of the game in Scotland. But what he is doing at the
moment is pretty useful -- and entertaining.
He is such a likeable big character, full of enthusiasm for the game,
possessing uncanny skills. He also has the right temperament. And, like
all natural goalscorers, he is greedy.
''Of course I am disappointed that I did not get a hat trick,'' he
said, after nipping in to meet the press before his manager. ''I had a
good chance to score three, but I missed it. Mind you, if I had scored
three, I would probably have been disappointed that I had not scored
four.
''We did not play as well in the second half. Against a side like
Meadowbank, and leading 3-0 at half time, we should have scored at least
five.''
The goals Van Hooydonk did score were of the highest class. His first,
in 23 minutes, was a thundering drive from just outside the penalty area
which almost lifted the roof off the net.
His second came in 36 minutes when Brian McLaughlin sent him clear on
the edge of the box. The big fellow steadied himself and, from an angle,
cracked a low shot in off the far post.
In between, he had a powerful header come off the bar. Falconer was
first to the rebound and he completed the job with a diving header.
Van Hooydonk admitted to being left out of the latest Dutch
international squad, although with players such as Bergkamp and Roy
available, he could only have hoped for a place on the bench.
''I want to be a part of the international set up,'' he said. ''My
goals today should let the manager know I am still around, and in
form.''
Celtic were guilty of being over elaborate after that, but all credit
must go to Meadowbank. They could have folded after losing goals so
quickly, but they buckled down and defended well in the second half.
Manager Micky Lawson retained a sense of humour in defeat. As he
addressed the assembled press corps, he remarked: ''This is like a
Meadowbank crowd.'' He then accused his players of being over confident,
and this time he was being serious.
''I thought if we could hold Celtic for 20 minutes, they would get a
bit restless, but after 20 minutes, my players got too confident. It
seemed as if they thought they could win the match. They lost the plan
for about 15 minutes, and were punished for it.
''I gave them them pelters at half time, but they showed great
character in the second half. It was important we didn't get a pasting,
because for us it is all about surviving in the second division until we
get to our new home in Livingston. Had we lost badly against Celtic, it
could have affected our confidence.''
It was good to see Tony Mowbray return to action for the first time
since Boxing Day. The big Celtic defender handled his recent personal
tragedy with a lot of courage and dignity and is now ready to fight for
his place in the side. He was given the captaincy on Saturday, and Tommy
Burns said: ''Anyone who came through what he has come through deserves
it. Understandably, his mind has been elsewhere for some time, but he
has worked so hard. When it came to naming a captain for the day, he was
the only man for me.''

Washington, Sunday
COLIN FERGUSON, who was convicted on Friday of murdering six people
and attempting to kill 19 others on a Long Island train in 1993, has
decided that he is probably mad, after all.
The judge had ruled that Ferguson was competent to stand trial, and he
elected to defend himself.
Before that, he had dismissed his lawyers, who had concluded that he
was psychotic and delusional. They wanted him to plead innocent by
reason of insanity.
The chief attorney, William Kunstler, a prominent defender of
unpopular cases, adumbrated the defence that Mr Ferguson suffered from
''black rage''. He is an immigrant from Jamaica, where he belonged to a
respectable, middle-class family.
When he came to the United States, according to the Kunstler thesis,
he was confronted by a racist society, forced to do menial work, and
constantly taunted with his failures. This drove him to madness, and led
him to take a machine gun into a suburban train and open fire on the
passengers.
Mr Ferguson refused to accept this theory, insisting that he was
perfectly sane. He was charged with 93 offences, and said it was obvious
that the number had been chosen because the charges were made in 1993.
He insisted at the trial that a white man had stolen his gun and
carried out the murders, though a score of witnesses identified him as
the murderer.
He has now re-hired Mr Kunstler to conduct his appeal. He cannot
revive the ''black rage'' defence, under the rules. Instead, Mr Kunstler
will demand a re-trial, on the grounds that the judge was wrong to allow
him to defend himself -- and then offer the insanity defence.
He will take the issue to the appeals court, if necessary. Survivors
and families of the dead are therefore faced with the possibility that
their ordeal is not over. Edgardo Tumangan, the secretary of the
Philippine Senate, said today he would sue the Long Island Rail Road for
$20m over the death of his daughter Marita.
The jury had no trouble in convicting Mr Ferguson on all the main
charges: six cases of murder, 19 of attempted murder, and some extra
weapons possession charges. They refused, however, to accept the
prosecution's charge that he was motivated by racial hatred, despite the
evidence of letters and notebooks found in his apartment denouncing
white people as the source of all evil. The jury thought him a
common-or-garden murderer.
The question of insanity in criminal cases has been constantly
restricted in the United States. It is now very unusual for a defendant
to escape on the grounds that he was mad. A man who drove around
Washington shooting people two years ago was declared incompetent to
stand trial, but that was very rare. Mr Ferguson will be sentenced next
month, and could be given 200 years in jail to life.

Zitoradje, Serbia, Sunday,
SERB paramilitary leader ''Commander Arkan'', whose private army waged
bloody war in the break-up of Yugoslavia, claimed a nationalist folk
singer as his bride today in a blaze of ceremonial gunfire.
Arkan's henchmen pulled a frightening array of automatic pistols,
revolvers, and assault rifles from beneath their black overcoats to fire
hundreds of rounds into the sky.
It was Yugoslavia's celebrity wedding of the year.
The match between Arkan, real name Zelko Raznjatovic, is a marriage
born on the nationalist battlefields of the former Yugoslavia. He is a
war hero to many Serbs, she is Ceca, the queen of ''Turbo Folk'', the
anthem of young Serbian xenophobes.
In 1992 the US State Department put Arkan on its list of alleged war
criminals in the Yugoslav war, alleging his crack ''Serbian Tigers''
brigade had committed blood-curdling atrocities in the wars in Croatia
and Bosnia.
Today, however, there was only admiration and awe for the power of the
military commander and shadowy businessman as he stormed into Ceca's
home village of Zitoradje in a 40-vehicle convoy led by a cherry-red
stretch Daimler.
''Yes, to us he is a hero,'' said one young girl as almost the entire
village packed into the narrow street outside Ceca's parents' home.
In a country isolated by sanctions and world approbrium, Arkan is a
hero. People in Serbia can't help admiring someone who gives two fingers
to the Western establishment.
With the military precision his units are famous for, Arkan drove into
Zitoradje to the echo of gunfire, dead on time at 9am after the 190-mile
drive from Belgrade.
Wearing a traditional Montenegrin outfit with gold-embroidered blouse,
knee-high leather boots, and an embroidered pill-box hat, Arkan was
handed a shotgun.
By Serb tradition he had to complete the suggestive task of shooting
down an apple hanging on a pole above the house.
Six blasts later and with his hat lying in the mud, Arkan finally blew
apart the tip of the pole sending the apple plummeting to earth and
allowing him to cross the threshold.
As if to make up for his poor performance with the shotgun, Arkan
blasted out the magazine of a snub-nosed machine gun and a Magnum
revolver in a classic display of Balkan machismo.
Two hours later, again to the exact moment specified in the programme
for what his entourage called ''the wedding of the decade'', Arkan and
Ceca emerged from the house to another crescendo of automatic weapons
fire, drowning out the gipsy brass band playing doggedly in the drizzle.
The 2000 people outside blocked the fleet of brand new Japanese and US
four-wheel-drive vehicles accompanying Ceca in the Daimler -- not a bad
line-up of cars in a country under a trade embargo.
Fuel, one of the main targets of the sanctions to punish Serbia for
its support of the Bosnian Serb war effort, was no problem. The convoy
fuelled up outside Arkan's glitzy house opposite Red Star football club
in Belgrade.
Arkan himself took the wheel of the first car, firing his pistol
through the sunroof as he drove to Belgrade and the Orthodox ceremony
for his third marriage, before a reception for 500.
No guns, please, guests were told.--Reuter.

Stenhousemuir 2, Aberdeen 0
ABERDEEN should have suspected when they saw the collectors outside
Ochilview Park rattling their tins for The Samaritans. If you dropped
some money in the tin, the ladies in their woolly hats gave you a
sticker which proclaimed their function: ''To help the suicidal and
despairing.''
Ian Donald, followed closely by Roy Aitken, would probably have been
seeking their money's worth as a darkness closed around Aberdeen
Football Club on Saturday evening, and just when they had thought it was
safe to go back to the football.
Before the end of Aberdeen's Scottish Cup fourth-round tie against
Stenhousemuir, their supporters were calling for the return of Willie
Miller and chanting the traditional mantra of the game's disillusioned:
''Sack the board.''
What now for the Dons, forlorn and fallen?
After having watched them try to impose their supposed greater powers
on opponents, who are revelling in their occasional days out from the
second division, it is impossible to say with any confidence if they
will ever come to their senses and turn back from a journey which seems
to be leading them into the wilderness.
However, the Pittodrie club's problems have been well documented this
season, and this space should be devoted to Stenhousemuir, a collection
of improbables and downright tough guys. Their priority before the game
was to ensure they would not be overrun or humiliated, and as the match
progressed, they sensed they could achieve much more than that.
They reached out and snatched their opportunity. Their win will live
in the game's folklore, and so, too, will the name Tommy Steel, an
Ayrshire farmer whose two goals took Stenhousemuir into the cup
quarter-finals for the first time since 1950.
Already the sweat will be forming on the brows of Hibs' players, who
will be wondering if part-time pros like Steel, 38-year-old Graeme
Armstrong, George McGeachie (36), Jimmy Fisher, and Mike Harkness, a
goalkeeper who likes to venture out of his box, have been singled out
for greatness this season.
Young Euan Donaldson also did extremely well at left back and could be
destined for further glory if he continues to progress, and Max
Christie, son of the manager, Terry, also had a good game. ''I always
know that if I hoover the carpets at home on a Saturday morning I'll get
a game,'' said Max.
It is difficult to imagine Fisher doing domestic chores, however. He
was a real old-fashioned warrior unwilling to opt out even though he had
broken his nose in a league match at Brechin last Tuesday night. The
midfield player appeared with plasters down his nose and across his
cheek bones, which from a distance made him look as though he was
wearing a white mask.
The 27-year-old put himself about, stealing the ball from Aberdeen's
players and rolling it on to his own colleagues. By the end, Paul Kane,
Eoin Jess, and Ray McKinnon, who had failed to win the midfield battle
may have been asking themselves: ''Who was that masked man?''
We all know him and the rest of his gang now, and although that will
make life harder for them when Hibs play their quarter-final tie at
Ochilview, which in parts resembled one of Steel's fields, it doesn't
really matter what happens to Stenhousemuir in the next round. They have
already done themselves proud.
Business was brisk in the Warriors Club and pubs throughout the town
where people relived the events of a wonderful sporting afternoon which
began in good humour and ended in delirium for Stenhousemuir's fans, who
made up the bulk of the 3500 capacity crowd, with cardboard signs being
put up near a kiosk.
''In a recent survey, the Warriors mince and gravy came out tops...80p
a portion,'' it said.
Somehow, the pre-match ambience suggested the locals were determined
to enjoy themselves and when only 10 minutes or so into the match
Harkness shouted out to his team-mates: ''Come on Warriors, we're
showing these people too much respect,'' Aberdeen might have guessed it
was going to be one of those days.
However, they should have been absolutely certain of the difficulties
when Christie appeared wearing his duffel coat, which local legend says
is some kind of lucky charm. ''Part of the pre-match preparation was
sending the coat to the cleaners,'' he said after his players had done
precisely the same thing to their opponents.
Aberdeen started the tie brightly enough, but after having hit a
series of shots over Harkness's bar, they found themselves getting
nowhere. They lacked style and offered little in the way of creative
play while Stenhousemuir settled into a pattern based on work and
running.
The first half ended with John Inglis and keeper Theo Snelders getting
in one another's way and allowing Adrian Sprott a shot from close range,
but he missed. It was, however, a sign of things to come.
In 59 minutes Fisher knocked the ball from left to right into
Aberdeen's box where Snelders and Miller Mathieson disputed possession
with neither winning. The ball dropped to Steel, and using his left
foot, thumped into the roof of the net.
Six minutes from time Gary Smith conceded a corner on his team's left
and as Sprott passed by to take the kick, he was told by Steel: ''Hit it
long.'' He did and Steel was waiting to sweep the ball into the net
again, this time with his right.
''Tommy is always good for a goal,'' Christie said. ''He's not one for
silky touches. Most people are nervous when they get a chance inside the
box, but Tommy's nervous outside the area. In fact, he has a touch only
when he's shooting.''
It was the 27-year-old's touches which gave Christie his finest ever
win as a manager and when asked about the prospects of beating Hibs, the
head teacher of Musselburgh Grammar said: ''Who wants to be realistic?
We'll start that on Monday.''

<HEADLINE>Price war taking toll on newspaper profits #15m drop likely for Telegraph</HEADLINE>

CUT-throat competition in the UK newspaper industry is putting
downward pressure on even the largest titles. Later this week The
Telegraph, controlled by Canadian tycoon Conrad Black, is expected to
reveal a drop of as much as #15m in its 1994 annual profits to around
#44m with little improvement expected in the current financial year.
This comes at a time when Newspaper Publishing, owner of the
Independent and Independent on Sunday, is rumoured to have lost #25m
last year.
In response to price cuts initiated in July 1993 by arch rival Rupert
Murdoch's Times, The Telegraph slashed its own weekday cover price last
June from 48p to 30p in order to defend its market share and attract
younger readers. It claims to have achieved success on both counts. A
special deal with Forte is likely to have made a notable contribition to
any increased in reported daily sales.
Against the background of a price war and uncertainty over circulation
trends, advertising revenue remains the most important source of growth
for the future. The results are expected to show a strong growth in
fourth quarter advertising revenues at both the daily and Sunday
Telegraph titles which will boost profitability.
The group is sheltered to some extent from the cold winds blowing
through the UK newspaper industry by support from overseas and
associated companies such as John Fairfax in Australia and the Southam
communications group in Canada.
Indeed, The Telegraph senior management has said that it believes that
reasonable levels of operating profitability will be sustainable even in
a prolonged period of low cover prices.
However, help may be at hand from external sources. A surge in world
newsprint prices is forcing all newspaper producers around the world to
consider pushing up their cover prices. In general, newsprint costs make
up 20-25% of a newspaper's total cost.
The increase in the number of newspaper supplements in recent years
during a time of low newsprint prices makes newspapers especially
vulnerable to any increase in input prices.
Increasing demand in the growing economies of South- east Asia such as
Taiwan, Korea and Indonesia, who all rely heavily on imported supplies,
is a primary factor in the rise in raw material prices.
Media analysts at Goldman Sachs are forecasting a near 60% rise in
newsprint prices by the end of 1997, with a 25% increase pencilled in
for 1995.
The Telegraph's share price has failed to recover from the slump
induced at the time of last year's cut in cover price. From a peak of
625p last year the shares closed at 380p on Friday.

Mozdok, Russia, Sunday.
RUSSIA'S military commander in Chechnya today effectively dealt a
death blow to talks with secessionist rebels, saying he would not extend
a ceasefire which expired at 6pm local time.
General Anatoly Kulikov released a pained statement at military
headquarters in the town of Mozdok, saying it was pointless holding
further ceasefire talks after rebels had attacked Russian troops
yesterday.
''The united military command has exhausted all the chances it had to
stop the fighting and is now obliged to take adequate measures,'' said
the statement.
Russian and Chechen military officials on Wednesday agreed on a
ceasefire, later extended until today. The two sides accused each other
of violating the truce but nevertheless had been expected to meet today
to discuss extending the deal.
''For a week we stood on the threshold of peace, sincerely believed in
this chance, and did all we could to achieve it,'' said Kulikov.
Russia drove rebel forces out of Grozny earlier this month after more
than two months of heavy fighting that destroyed the city. Now the
Russians would seem to have little choice but to push for the complete
capitulation of their opponents.
Kulikov blamed a small circle around rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev
''ready to destroy thousands of people and buildings to further their
political ambitions'' for trying to break into the regional capital
Grozny last night.
The Russian Government press service said 80 rebels were killed when a
group of fighters used mortars, grenade launchers, and small arms when
they tried to move into the city from the west, near a big oil refinery.
''The fighting lasted five-and-a-half hours. Dudayev's unit was
blockaded and destroyed,'' the press service said, adding that Russian
positions near the village of Chechenaul, near the southern suburbs of
Grozny, had also been shelled.
The headquarters of the Chechen insurgents, according to Interfax news
agency, admitted the attack but said only two men had been wounded. The
Chechen assault started at least 10 fires at the refinery.
Interfax said Russian artillery had shelled Chechen positions in the
south-western suburbs of Grozny overnight.
An international aid worker, a veteran of relief operations in many
wars across the world, said a lasting ceasefire was unlikely because no
neutral party was present to interpose itself between the warring sides.
''Heavily armed Russians and Chechens are rubbing up against one
another in many places on the ground. What's needed is a neutral party
with the confidence of both sides and good communications to help defuse
tensions,'' he said.
The two sides had been due to meet in Grozny yesterday to exchange
lists of prisoners, but there was no sign of the swop taking place.
Interfax said Dudayev's supporters had been allowed to take their dead
from Grozny.
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, stopping briefly in the
Russian enclave of Kaliningrad after a visit to Poland, was quoted by
Tass as saying Moscow wanted to continue negotiations.
In Moscow, however, President Boris Yeltsin's top aide said talk of
political negotiations on Chechnya's future was premature.
''We must first find forces which could be partners in such talks and
who people in Chechnya would trust,'' said Sergei Filatov, head of
Yeltsin's administration.
Russia has issued an arrest warrant for Dudayev, a former Soviet air
force general who in an interview published by the Los Angeles Times
yesterday said that Chechen guerrillas were preparing to attack military
targets in Russian cities.--Reuter.

Huntly 1 Dundee United 3
THE ingredients were all there but United refused to adhere to the
giant-killing script as they ventured into unknown territory in breezy
Strathbogie. A heaving, claustrophobic ground, fans baying for blood,
and former players with a point to prove -- all lay in wait for Ivan
Golac and his cosmopolitan stars.
Yet still Tangerine ribbons hang from the cup. United subdued the
Huntly challenge, bringing the talented part-timers to their knees in 45
minutes and winning the tie before the half-time oranges were peeled.
Huntly keeper John Gardiner, who had his run-ins with Jim McLean when
he played for United a decade ago, was caught out in 12 and 32 minutes
for the goals which kept a smile on Golac's face.
Man of the match Billy McKinlay released Dave Bowman, who delivered a
cross which Craig Brewster met with a looping header which seemed
reachable but arced over Gardiner.
Then, 20 minutes later, the keeper misjudged a Gordan Petric free kick
which flew over his head for Maurice Malpas to nod into the net.
The locals in the 4500 crowd felt deflated at that, but Huntly raised
their spirits with a fiery second half showing which pegged back the
holders and brought the goal that manager Steve Paterson had predicted
all week.
David Hannah had made it 3-0 in 76 minutes with a well-taken shot past
Gardiner, but it was Martin Stewart's effort three minutes later that
created a roar heard throughout Aberdeenshire, producing a fine finish
to fire past Kelham O'Hanlon from skipper Steve Lennox's through ball.
''We only win the cup the hard way,'' said Golac after the tie, and
after learning United faced a quarter final trip to Hearts or Rangers.
''We have played far too many games away from home but that's football
-- we would never be happy to win it the easy way.''
Huntly manager Paterson, who will now return to the business of
wrapping up another Highland League title, added: ''My players feel a
bit disappointed that they didn't get more out of it. United got two
goals out of nothing.''
At half-time the drama had come off the field when United fans,
watching police chase a kilted ''Arab'' off the field, surged forward
and caused an advertising board to collapse. The restart was delayed
several minutes as police moved the fans back on to the packed terrace,
with Jim McLean coming out at one point to calm the tensions.
Police chief superintendent Alastair Henderson said later: ''A few
United supporters at the back of the crowd pushing forward caused the
problem. It was disappointing because, apart from that, we had no
trouble and it was an incident-free day.''
Given what happened to their New Firm colleagues, an incident-free day
was all United could have wanted.

Baghdad, Sunday
BRITISH industrialists are being showered with hospitality on a visit
to Baghdad and a spokesman said they were seeing a vast potential market
ahead for the UK.
''We have been received incredibly well,'' said Edmund Sykes,
co-ordinator of the Iraqi British Interests Group.
''We have had fantastic meetings. There is vast potential for us now
and in the future.''
The 25 businessmen arrived in Baghdad on Friday to explore ways to
resume some form of business with Iraq despite tight United Nations
sanctions imposed on Baghdad after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
The official English language daily, the Baghdad Observer, published
an open letter to the businessmen, welcoming their visit and heaping
praise on ''their courageous move''.
Sources close to the group said they would try to exert pressure on
the Government to soften its stand on Iraq sanctions at the UN Security
Council.
The businessmen were holding discussions with officials of Iraq's
Central Bank and eight government ministries.
The group includes representatives from the firms De La Rue, Amersham
International, and Leyland Trucks.--Reuter.

Belgrade, Sunday
RUSSIAN Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said today that Belgrade
wanted peace in former Yugoslavia and that an easing of sanctions would
help to extend the ceasefire in Bosnia.
Kozyrev was speaking after a weekend of secluded talks with Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic, who counts Moscow as an ally among
international peacebrokers.
The men were discussing a proposal by the big powers to ease sanctions
on Belgrade if it recognised independent Croatia and Bosnia.
There was no indication of Milosevic's response to the plan, but
Kozyrev told reporters before leaving for Moscow that he was convinced
the Serbian president was committed to peace.
''It may be late, but it is necessary now to take the path of support
for Belgrade and to take steps to lift the sanctions against
Yugoslavia,'' the official Tanjug news agency quoted him as saying.
''This will increase the chances of preventing the truce in Bosnia
from ending in a new disastrous outbreak of hostilities.''
A fragile truce intended to boost the peace process has held across
Bosnia since January 1 but is due to expire on March 31.
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic, in remarks broadcast by
Serbian radio, said his country was pleased with the outcome of the
talks with Kozyrev.
He said Milosevic and Kozyrev discussed the settlement of the Yugoslav
crisis. ''Here, too, we concluded that there is a high degree of accord
in our views . . . '' he said.
Jovanovic said the two sides had not changed their view that sanctions
against Belgrade should be lifted but they were unhappy with the
international community's resistance to this.
''We must say that we are not satisfied with the attitudes of the
others. Their response to our policy of peace and efforts is inadequate,
to say the least,'' he said.
Russia's Contact Group envoy, Alexandar Zlotov, said he was waiting
for the US delegate, Robert Frasure, now briefing Croatian President
Franjo Tudjman on the group's latest plan, to join him for talks with
Milosevic tomorrow.
Belgrade television reported that Croatian Foreign Minister Mate
Granic was also expected in Belgrade tomorrow.
In Bosnia's Bihac enclave, Muslim-led government forces and Muslim
rebels pounded each other with artillery and fought on the ground for a
third day running near the rebel stronghold of Valika Kladusa, the
stronghold of businessman-turned-rebel leader Fikret Abdic.
''They are fighting for ground but we haven't seen a change in the
confrontation line or any major successes,'' said the UN spokesman in
Sarajevo, British Lieutenant-Colonel Gary Coward.
More than 244 ''detonations'' -- military parlance for heavy weapons
fire -- were counted over the period, he said. Sporadic fighting also
took place near Bihac town, where the Government's 5th Corps is bottled
up by Abdic's forces.
Elsewhere, a meeting in central Bosnia between Serbs and Croats to
discuss the wider ceasefire was called off after both sides refused to
attend, said Lieutenant-Colonel Coward.--Reuter.

DUNDEE United chairman Jim McLean wants to meet the group of Tannadice
fans who came close to causing Scottish Cup mayhem at Huntly on
Saturday.
McLean was seen on television on Saturday night remonstrating with
supporters after a barrier behind a goal collapsed during the interval.
What started as a one-man pitch invasion by a kilted fan could have
turned nasty -- and McLean is seeking urgent action to sort out the
problem.
''There was a small group of United supporters who, in my opinion, had
consumed too much drink. Long before the collapse they were swaying and
pushing forward into fans in front of them.''
McLean made his move when the barrier came down and said: ''I spelled
out to the supporters that we were leading 2-0 but the game could be
abandoned.
''I was addressing people at the front of the crowd but I should have
been talking to those at the back because that is where the problem lay.
''I will try to identify and talk to these people. I want to spell it
out that this club has worked long and hard to develop a sporting
reputation and don't want it ruined.''

Dundee 1, Raith Rovers 2
LET'S be serious for a moment. Raith Rovers are not going to win
another major cup this season, are they?
The Coca-Cola thing was nice for them, gave the smaller clubs a lift,
the Rangers fans a good laugh, and the footballing public at large
something to chat about. But there is no way we'll see navy and white
ribbons on the Scottish Cup in May. That is Roy of the Rovers stuff, is
it not?
But wait. You've only heard half of it because there was talk in and
around Dens Park on Saturday that, with Raith now nicely placed in the
league race, the word treble was heard to be uttered, and more than
once. Give some an inch and . . .
Yes, Raith did well at the weekend and their smiles widened further
when their club was paired at home with Airdrie in the quarter-final
stage of the cup, the men from Lanarkshire having been seen off on the
Coca-Cola glory trail.
But what is all this nonsense about a treble? Are Raith all that good?
Well, they haven't been beaten for ages so they must be doing something
right. At the weekend, they started poorly, losing a goal to George
Shaw, and received a talking to from manager Jimmy Nicholl at the
interval, then promptly played Dundee off the park.
They carry an element of good fortune, of course, but what team on the
crest of a winning wave does not? Dundee defenders Jim Duffy and Noel
Blake did themselves a mischief during the action which did Raith no
harm, but had Dundee keeper Michel Pageaud not been on his toes, the
winning margin could well have been far greater.
Ally Graham equalised before Jason Rowbotham, just on as a substitute,
crossed the ball in speculative fashion into the Dundee box. Everyone
appeared to think someone else would kick it, no one did, and the ball
ended up in the net. Bizarre but effective.
Rowbotham was excited when he described his winner. ''I saw Colin
Cameron making a run, '' he said, ''and curled it behind the defence and
luckily it just kept curling.'' And when Airdrie's name was mentioned as
his side's next cup opponents, the Englishman just quietly smiled. ''A
home tie is great, and gives us a real chance now,'' adding that Raith's
chances of taking the treble were ''definitely'' on.
But while the Raith lot were wallowing in adulation, Dundee manager
Duffy sat slumped in a chair apparently with the weight of the world's
worries on his shoulders. ''We had to change our system because of
injuries,'' he said. ''We may not have won but I don't think we would
have lost had we not to change things.''
As regards the ones who think Raith could again go all the way, I
wonder which would be more beneficial -- a trip to the bookies or one to
a shrink. But wait a minute, was not the idea of a Raith win in the
Coca-Cola Cup thought of as a little foolish at the time?

Jerusalem, Sunday
ISRAEL'S Cabinet today approved the expansion of three Jewish
settlements around Jerusalem in a move that could further upset peace
talks with the Palestinians.
In another sign of persisting tensions, Israeli soldiers shot and
killed a 19-year-old Palestinian youth suspected of infiltrating from
the Gaza Strip.
Israel today allowed about 1000 workers past the Erez crossing. The
frontier was closed nearly a month ago after a suicide attack killed 21
Israelis in central Israel. Special buses were chartered to transport
the labourers as a security precaution, Israel radio said.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was quoted by Israel radio as saying that
easing the closure was a sacrifice of Israeli security interests for the
sake of building Palestinian confidence in peace talks.
Palestinian discontent over the closure, settlement expansion, and
Israel's lag on expanding Palestinian self-rule into the West Bank,
peaked this weekend. Israeli media reported that PLO leader Yasser
Arafat had threatened to resign control of the Gaza Strip and return to
Tunis.
Arafat later denied the threat, Israel radio said. However he
complained that Israel had so far delayed implementing the 1993 peace
accord -- holding Palestinian elections and pulling Israeli troops out
of key West Bank cities -- by more than eight months.
The settlement plan approved today was opposed by four Cabinet members
and two abstained.
Hatem Abdul Qader, a spokesman for PLO headquarters in east Jerusalem,
said: ''They are putting the whole peace process in jeopardy.''--AP.

Bonn, Sunday
GERMAN Finance Minister Theo Waigel said today that it did not look as
if a single European currency could be introduced in 1997, the earliest
date envisaged for monetary union in the Maastricht Treaty.
Waigel said in a radio interview that recent pressure, especially in
France, to speed progress towards a single currency did not alter the
fact that strict economic criteria for convergence had first to be met.
''Germany will not agree to a slackening of the criteria,'' he told
radio in Bavaria.
The debate on EMU has heated up in Germany in the past week, with both
the centre-right government and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD)
warning against hasty moves to jettison the cherished Deutschmark.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said today that currency stability was
essential to combat the sort of hyperinflation that Germany suffered
between the two world wars.
''The loss of all savings . . . explains the Germans' special interest
in a stable currency,'' he said at a party celebrating the 125th year of
the existence of a leading bank, the Commerzbank.
Under the Maastricht treaty, the EU aims to create a single currency
in 1997 or 1999. Member states must meet so-called ''convergence''
criteria on inflation, budgetary discipline, interest rates, and
currency stability in order to qualify.
The introduction of a single currency would automatically be postponed
until 1999 if less than half of EU members failed to fulfil the criteria
by 1997.
In the interview, Waigel indicated that the timing of EMU remained
open. Only the EU members' success in achieving stability would
determine when it could happen, he said.
On Wednesday, he said that the European Union had made undeniable
progress last year towards a single currency.
The opposition Social Democrats, meanwhile, said this weekend that
they would oppose a single currency that did not guarantee as much
stability as the Deutschmark.
In another development today, Jean-Claude Juncker, the Prime Minister
of Luxembourg, said today that the EU would lose credibility if it did
not have a single currency by 1997, but conceded that 1999 was a more
realistic date.
* Germany's struggling Free Democrats today resumed power in Hesse
after nine successive defeats in regional polls.
The result was an important reprieve for Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel, who has seen the liberal party lose every state poll and the
European Parliament vote since he took over as FDP leader in
1993.--Reuter.

LOCKERBIE Ex-Chief Constable George Esson, the man at the centre of
the world's biggest murder investigation, talks to The Herald
EXCLUSIVE
As the prospect of a trial in the Lockerbie Disaster reaches deadlock,
the Government is facing a mounting barrage of accusation that it has
been responsible for a political cover-up.
With that bandwagon gaining momentum, the gist of the argument is that
it diverted police investigation from Syria and Iran because it needed
their support against Iraq in the Gulf War of 1991 -- and preferred to
target the Libya of Colonel Gaddafi.
The scramble to uncover a conspiracy and produce ''new evidence'' in
the world's biggest murder case has brought demands for a public inquiry
-- unlikely to be granted since it would virtually render a subsequent
trial impossible.
But now, in the continuing public confusion, the man at the heart of
the investigation, former Chief Constable George Esson, has answered key
questions put to him by The Herald.
Mr Esson, now retired from Dumfries and Galloway and back in his
native Aberdeenshire as security adviser to Shell Expro, is still
subject to the Official Secrets Act.
But for all the attacks directed at the Government -- and the fact
that the buck stops officially with the Lord Advocate -- the accusations
also cast shadows on the investigation by Scottish police who were faced
with the biggest murder hunt in criminal history.
So was there a cover-up? Was Esson under pressure to take the heat off
Syria and Iran and turn it on Gaddafi's Libya instead?
''There was absolutely no cover-up,'' he says emphatically. ''And I
was never at any time under any political pressure. If you look at the
facts, we had turned our attention to Libya long before the Gulf War of
1991. Our men were in Malta investigating the Libyan connection in the
summer of 1989.''
What would he have done if he had been put under political pressure to
alter the course of the investigation?
''I would not have gone along with it. It might seem strange to people
in other countries but this is the way we operate in Scotland. This was
a straight-forward police operation.''
So what are the facts?
For a start, the manhunt resulted in two members of the Libyan
Intelligence Service being charged with the atrocity of Christmas 1988,
when 259 passengers of PanAm flight 103 were catapulted from their Jumbo
jet at 31,000ft and 11 more died when the wreckage came tumbling down on
the Scottish Border town of Lockerbie.
The main thrust of the case is that the two men were responsible for
an unaccompanied suitcase being placed on board a plane in Malta, tagged
through Frankfurt to London for transfer to PanAm 103, which would be
heading for New York. The suitcase is said to have contained an
explosive concealed in a radio casette recorder, programmed to be
detonated by an electronic timer. It exploded ''...and they did murder
them''.
But the Lord Advocate of Scotland has so far been unable to bring the
Libyans to trial. Frustration runs high, in tandem with accusations. Dr
Jim Swire, a spokesman for British relatives, whose daughter died at
Lockerbie, has gone as far as to say: ''I'm beginning to wonder if there
is a Libyan connection at all. The evidence seems to be disintegrating
by the week.''
The picture is also confused by the latest ''evidence'' which sought
to swing suspicion back to Syria and Iran.
This evidence alleges a ''confession'' by Palestinian terrorist Abdel
Ghadanfar that he was part of an Iranian-funded group planning a
terrorist attack at Frankfurt. It says that, when he and his group were
arrested by the German police before the Lockerbie Disaster, one of
them, Marwan Khreesat, was in possession of two barometric detonators --
''of the type that set off the bomb which destroyed PanAm flight 103''.
There George Esson claims a fundamental mistake and states that the
indictment says nothing about barometric detonators, which would set off
an explosive when the plane reached a certain height.
''The indictment says the Lockerbie explosion was caused by a
straight-forward electronic timer, bought from a firm in Zurich,'' he
says.
Other ''new evidence'' also claims that Ghadanfar, whose
''confession'' dates back to 1988, was released by the Germans before
the Scottish police had a chance to interview him.
''Baloney,'' says George Esson. ''Our men did interview Ghadanfar in
Germany. In those early days Marwan Khreesat was indeed our prime
suspect. It would have been grossly incompetent not to have examined
this side of it. But all this is caul kail. There was no evidence.''
So what compelled the Scottish police to turn their pursuit from a
Middle East terrorist cell in Germany to two Libyans with a base in
Malta?
The full story of what happened at Lockerbie and the criminal
investigation that followed has still to be told.
In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, I remember standing in the
devastation of Sherwood Crescent, Lockerbie, and trying to reconstruct
in my own mind the passengers' moment of realisation of what was
happening.
It was the ultimate nightmare of anyone who has ever been in an
aeroplane. Medical experts reckoned all passengers would have lost
consciousness within seconds of the explosion but the younger ones would
have regained it as they neared the ground.
Incredibly, a man and a child were calculated to have been alive for a
time, the man having rib injuries which would not have caused his death
if he had been found in time.
After finding the remains of the 259 bodies from the plane, the police
then faced a search which eventually produced four million pieces of
debris from 845 square miles of winter landscape.
The investigation was led by Detective Chief Superintendent John Orr
and the evidence was passed on for examination to Britain's leading
forensic experts, Dr Thomas Hayes and Dr Allen Feraday, of the Royal
Armament Research and Development Establishment.
For their success against terrorists, both were high on the IRA's hit
list.
A watershed in the Lockerbie investigation came when these two men
managed to identify a selection of blast-damaged clothing which seemed
to have come from the suitcase containing the explosive. The common
factor was that the clothes were made in Malta.
Neither the police nor the forensic men knew of any Maltese
significance, though it would be interesting to find out who bought any
of these garments.
Soon after the disaster, John Orr was asking the German police if they
could produce a list showing the origins of the luggage which was put on
the plane at Frankfurt before it left for London, en route to New York.
For reasons never satisfactorily explained, the German police couldn't
produce the list. But seven months after that first request, the
Frankfurt company which ran the airport luggage transfer system came up
with the full list.
When it was flown to Scotland, George Esson and John Orr couldn't
believe what they were seeing. The Germans had failed to pick up the
significance of one unaccompanied suitcase which arrived at Frankfurt,
tagged for New York -- having arrived from Malta!
Valuable time had been lost but, in great secrecy, Detective Chief
Inspector Harry Bell led a Scottish police team to the George Cross
island to pursue their inquiries. By that combination of skill and luck
they not only reached the manufacturers of the garments but found the
one little shop on the island which sold them all -- to one man.
Shopkeeper Tony Gauci remembered the bizarre nature of the purchase --
the customer just wanted a collection of garments, irrespective of size,
quality or cost -- and he reeled of the list of items bought, from a
''baby-gro'' to an imitation Harris tweed jacket.
That list corresponded precisely to the garments identified by Hayes
and Feraday.
In all the current furore about the Scottish police being on the wrong
track, one wonders what the critics would have done if presented with
that kind of evidence? Would they have ignored it? Wouldn't they have
been the first to condemn the Scottish police if they had ignored it?
Even that was just the starting point of deeper investigation, which
led to the charges now standing. As well as being classed Intelligence
men, the accused Al Amin Khalifi Fhimah is described as station manager
of Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta and Abdel Baset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi
is said to be head of security for the same airline.
George Esson says: ''When I hear what some people are saying I know
that they are not privy to the knowledge of those involved in this
painstaking and thorough investigation.''
Curiously, while the weight of attack on the Scottish lawmen comes
from Britain, the American relatives of Lockerbie victims, by far the
largest group, are strongly supportive of those men at Dumfries and
Galloway, whose diligence, compared to what they know in the United
States, astounds them.
The media speculation that an Iranian ayatollah might have paid for
the Lockerbie atrocity, in reprisal for an American warship shooting
down an Iranian airbus in July 1988, is perfectly plausible, as much so
as the idea that Colonel Gaddafi was getting his own back for an
American reprisal raid on Tripoli which killed his adopted daughter.
The existence of a Mister Big, whoever he may be, is almost beyond
dispute. But in the absence of any proof against such a person -- a
common hazard in criminal investigation -- the Scottish police could not
ignore the evidence, which they are ready to bring into open court,
against the men they believe to have been the actual perpetrators of the
Lockerbie Disaster.

UP TO 30 Olympus sports shops, 15% of the 200-strong chain, are
expected to close as part of a major overhaul of the business by parent
company Sears, the retail conglomerate whose trading formats also
include Dolcis, Adams, Wallis, and the Selfridges department store in
London.
Through Olympus and Millets, Sears is the market leader in the sports
and leisure market. However, it has turned in a dismal financial
performance in recent years although the company does not separately
disclose Olympus' trading results. The business returned to profit last
year after losses incurred in 1992/93. Sales in Sears' sports &amp;
leisurewear division grew by 4% last year to #187.5m.
The sportswear market is highly competitive with much price
discounting and changing fashion trends have caught Olympus on the hop
in the past. There have been management changes aimed at addressing new
opportunities in product ranges, in-store operations and systems but
these have failed to improve the situation. One casualty is John Fallon,
managing director of Sear's sports &amp; leisure division, who is leaving
the company.
Olympus Sportsworld, offering a comprehensive range of sports clothing
and equipment, is expanding in the growing out-of-town sector of the
market. It is to be the main focus of future development of the brand
with the number of outlets rising from 17 to 30. Increasingly in the
value-conscious environment of the 1990s, retailers have to offer a
combination of attractive products at resonable prices and good customer
service.
Market talk of the sale of Olympus is probably premature but there is
not too much time to turn the chain around given the possible arrival on
our shores of other low-priced superstore formats. The powerful US
chains, Sports Authority, and Sports Unlimited, are rumoured to be
considering a move into the lucrative UK market.
Sears likes to compare itself with Marks &amp; Spencer, which operates in
many of the same markets but achieves higher margins. Although Sears is
well down the road to recovery, Marks &amp; Spencer shares represent a
better bet for those seeking investment in the retail sector.

A HEAVY week for company results kicks off with full-year figures
today from Low &amp; Bonar and they are expected to show a strong advance in
profits. The last note on the group from Bell Lawrie White, its joint
brokers, projected some #42m for the year to November, up from #31.6m.
Low reported strong first-half profits growth and Bell Lawrie believes
this has continued, as was shown in the third quarter results from the
79% Canadian offshoot which had profits 70% ahead. Recent acquisitions
have been performing well and Low's strength in its markets means it is
able to pass on rising raw material costs. Dividends of 11p, a 10%
increase, are projected by the brokers.
Natwest tops the bill tomorrow, and analysts' forecasts of profits
range from #1500m to #1620m, against #989m in 1993. A 14% increase in
dividends is likely.
The profits surge will stem from reduced bad debt charges as the
recession lifted. These are seen almost halving to below #700m. Analysts
will be looking closely at the bank's cost/income ratio which is higher
than for the other big clearers. They will be expecting NatWest to say
something about how it intends to reduce its costs.
Wednesday is short of big names but Thursday brings an extensive list
of blue chips, led by British Gas. No doubt the questions of executive
pay and customer service will be raised again as the group checks in
with profits of around #90m, according to Panmure Gordon, against a loss
of #365m in 1993, when there were heavy restructuring costs.
However, the fourth quarter will disappoint owing to the mild weather.
Dividends look like topping 15p, up from 14.5p. The market will be
expecting information on how the great restructuring is proceeding.
ICI is no longer the bellwether stock but its results will still
command much interest as an indication of the outlook for the chemical
industry. As BP showed last week, margins have much improved and this
should propel ICI's profits to around #500m against #374m, after a final
quarter surge.
There is some concern that prices may have peaked already and
reassurance will be sought from ICI on this. Hopeful analysts reckon the
final dividend may be edged up to mark the retirement in April of
chairman Sir Denys Henderson.
Speaking of BP, the other oil giant, Shell, will report on Thursday
and chemicals are well to the fore in its case also. As a result,
NatWest Securities analyst Fergus MacLeod forecasts fourth-quarter
replacement cost net income up from the provision-hit #776m last time to
#1400m.

NEW YORK: An overwhelming majority of American lawyers questioned in

THE economy is still on course for a lengthy period of steady growth
with relatively low inflation -- despite a pick-up in prices last month
and evidence of a sharp slowdown in consumer spending, a leading
economist said today.
The risks of overheating were exaggerated and the authorities should
be wary of pushing interest rates any higher, said Alan Davies, chief
economist at Barclays Bank.
Any further rise in base rates from the current level of 6.75% was not
justified on the grounds of fighting inflation and risked overkill for
the domestic economy, which was already showing distinct signs of
outright weakness, he said in his latest forecast.

FROM a traditional business equipment supplier of 20 years ago,
Claremont has adapted to the commercial needs of the 1990s by
identifying a market for a specialist company with the scope and
imagination to create ''total'' business environments for its clients.
Managing director Alex Hutton explained: ''A client who comes into our
offices normally has either new premises and needs help in the planning
and design of these, or else he has an existing building which he wants
to completely refurbish.''
Claremont offers a whole range of services from space planning,
interior design, the provision of systems furniture, carpeting and
decoration, heating and ventilation through to furniture installation
and project management. ''We will fit out premises from scratch,''
stressed Hutton, ''This includes providing new ceilings, lighting
systems, air conditioning, partitions and curtains. We have more than 20
years' experience in designing and refurbishing, the interiors of
offices, so clients can be confident of a first-class service.
''We approach the job from a problem-solving angle. We examine all the
problems, be they design, functional or environmental. We are also
conscious of aesthetic considerations as well as functional ones. And to
this end we have established the most advanced design technology centre
in the country.
''Basically we can take a derelict building, completely design and
refurbish it on the computer, download it to a standard VHS video
cassette and plug it into a video. This virtual reality technique means
we can actually stand in that derelict building and allow our client to
walk through it as it will be once it has been designed and fully
refurbished. This is a considerable advantage, because when most people
look at drawings they can't visualise the finished product. But with our
system they can experience what their new office will be like, at a
stage when they can still make major changes or minor alterations.''
Claremont has a range of blue chip clients, from ScottishPower, The
Clydesdale Bank and Standard Life to IBM and Honeywell. The company
recently supplied all the furniture for Glasgow District Council Housing
Department and is currently designing and fitting out offices for the
new ScottishPower Telecommunications Division in St Vincent Street. They
also recently fitted out a financial services office for the Clydesdale
Bank in Aberdeen, as well as carrying out the interior design and
fitting of Templeton Fund Managers office in Saltire Court in Edinburgh.
Other recent contracts include Trainer Advertising's new corporate
headquarters in Paisley Road, Glasgow, Semple Fraser Corporate Lawyers
in St Vincent Street, as well as the Honeywell offices in Aberdeen and
the British Coal offices in Newcastle, Mansfield and Manchester.
The company's success over the years has also led them to set up a
leisure contracts division which specialises in the design and
refurbishment of leisure venues, particularly golf clubs. This seems
highly appropriate as Claremont is the current sponsor of the Scottish
Youth and Mid-amateur Golf Championship. Golf clubs they have designed
and fitted out the interiors of include Cardross, Braehead, Cathcart
Castle, Cochrane Castle, Erskine and Paisley. In addition they have been
responsible for the interior of Kilmacolm Bowling Club and Goodyear
Sports and Social Club.
With more than 23 years' experience in creating business and leisure
environments the company prides itself on meeting a client's every need
in building, refurbishing and extending -- from conception to completion
-- with its ''one step'' service. From a one-man operation in the 1970s,
it has grown into a major business employing 55 people, from sales and
administrative staff to design and contract staff, including surveyors.
Four years ago Claremont bought the old Coats Viyella factory, a
famous landmark in Kinning Park which is easily seen from the Kingston
Bridge and the M8. Alex Hutton commented: ''The continuing success of
the company enabled us to turn this into the Claremont Centre, a
multi-faceted facility accommodating our warehousing requirements.
''Excess space has been converted into factory and office
accommodation which has been sub-let to a variety of companies operating
in areas such as telecommunications, management consultancy and tool
distribution. We have transformed the entire building from a textile
factory into a highly modern business centre for the most discerning
client.''
As far as Claremont's future plans are concerned, Alex Hutton said:
''At present we are located in Glasgow and Edinburgh, but we are
currently considering the possibility of opening in Aberdeen.''

TERRY Bulloch, a Stenhousemuir supporter who also happens to be
chairman of the second-division club, had a glazed look.
Standing in the decaying surroundings of Ochilview Park, he was
allowing himself to dream of a new stand, maybe even a Tennents Scottish
Cup final.
Ridiculous? Probably, but people are entitled to lose a hold on
reality when smitten by the romance of the cup, which made a timely
return given the malice that marred football last week.
As Bulloch wandered around his humble domain wearing a grin that
looked as though it had found a permanent home, his counterpart from
Aberdeen, Ian Donald, had little about which to smile.
He is living in fear of relegation from the premier division, and now
his team is out of the cup. Donald was unwilling to talk about the 2-0
defeat inflicted by Stenhousemuir, and his manager Roy Aitken was only
slightly more accommodating.
''This is Terry Christie's day. Let him do the talking,'' Aitken said,
after having spent a long time in the dressing room with his players,
who gave him nothing during the 90 minutes.
Christie took the opportunity and praised all of his players for
giving him his greatest ever result as a manager.
''They all played their parts and they deserved their win,'' he said,
before accepting gratefully a home quarter-final tie against Hibernian,
the club he supported as a boy.
Yesterday, however, Aitken was willing to say more, and made it clear
he will not spare anyone's feelings when they report at Pittodrie this
morning.
''I will be discussing with them, individually and collectively, as to
where we take it from here,'' he said.
''They have shown both sides of their character by beating Rangers and
then giving a performance unworthy of our expectations.''
These players failed Willie Miller, and they look as though they will
do the same to Aitken, who is trying to convince Donald that he should
be given a manager's contract.
He will be worthy of the job if he can persuade the players to perform
with the pride and skill that has been missing from their work for much
of the season so far.
''I felt Aberdeen were not over-aggressive,'' said Tommy Steel, a
farmer, who scored both the Warriors' goals.
Steel and his team-mates played with a determination and a sense of
fun in stark contract to their opponents, who have much soul-searching
to do.
Having beaten Rangers 2-0 last week, Aberdeen gave their fans reason
to believe that the club's free fall towards the first division had been
arrested; but nothing can be assumed with this team.
The consensus is still that Aberdeen are too good to go down or become
embroiled in a play-off with a first-division side for survival in the
top flight. However, few expected them to lose at Ochilview. These
players cannot be trusted.
Bulloch, who is probably still smiling, said he and his committee of
eight others, who must stand for re-election every three years, said the
tie against Hibs will not be taken away from Ochilview,, even though the
capacity is only 3500.
''We have still to discuss it, but I think we will be playing on our
own pitch,'' he said.
Bulloch, who says his team was assembled at a cost of around #80,000
-- ''that's mainly signing-on fees'' -- knows other clubs might look at
his manager.
But he promised that Stenhousemuir would fight hard to keep Christie,
who doesn't have a contract, at Ochilview.
The chairman added that the money from their cup run will be used to
help build a new stand and also to attract some more players, but some
will have to be kept for bonus payments. It is understood the
Stenhousemuir squad were on #400 a man to beat Aberdeen.
Having reached the quarter-finals, Stenhousemuir will be expecting to
welcome a contingent of their Norwegian supporters' club to the tie.
Bulloch explained: ''We have the largest supporters' club of any
foreign team in Norway, apparently because our club name means
stonehouse wall in Norwegian.''

ON February 22 and 23, Claremont will be holding an exhibition to mark
the opening of their new showroom and design facility at 112 Cornwall
South, in Kinning Park. The exhibition, which is open from 10am until
7pm, also marks the launch of ranges of system furniture by Coras, Oasis
and Varga.
Coras is a fully integrated desking, panelling, tabling and storage
system which draws on the findings of an extensive three-year design and
development programme concentrating on ''the effective office
environment''. Alchemede, a British team of chartered designers, was
given a detailed design brief addressing international issues affecting
the specification of office furniture.
The product is mainly manufactured from cast aluminium with a choice
of veneered or laminated particle board work surfaces and storage units.
Small quantities of steel and PVC are used within certain furnishing
components. Flexibility is a key feature and Coras can either be
screen-hung or free standing, enabling a wide variety of styles and
sizes of configuration, all starting from simple, functional work
stations.
Coras is particularly suited to five types of office interior:
reception areas in both corporate and service industry environments;
cellular offices requiring either general or managerial freestanding
furniture; the open-plan office where a panel-based solution is needed
to provide individual or team work stations; the open-plan office where
personal and general storage can be integrated with freestanding primary
and secondary work surfaces and screens to create personal or
departmental office space within a large floor area without floor to
ceiling partitioning and finally, conference, meeting and board rooms of
widly varying capacity, built to set sizes from standard components.
Claremont's sales director Stephen Patrick said: ''I am highly
enthusiastic about the new Coras range. We have already concluded a
number of substantial contracts to fit out commercial offices with this
new system furniture.''
The new Varga range of seating from Wallis, Britain's leading
manufacturer of all kinds of office seating, will also be on show at the
exhibition, as will the new Oasis range of systems from Gresham Office
Furniture. Stephen Patrick added: ''This executive range will complement
their highly successful Design 2000 systems.''
Alex Hutton, Claremont's managing director, proudly emphasised: ''The
new showroom was designed and created from an existing showroom, which
was totally renovated and redesigned within the space of five weeks.
This is a task that only a company with Claremont's expertise could
complete within this time scale.''
The exhibition, according to Alex Hutton: ''Will be of interest to
anybody likely to move or refurbish their premises within the next
three, six, 12 or 18 months. It is never too soon to speak to Claremont.
This exhibition will give both existing and potential clients an
opportunity to see and evaluate the very latest in office environments.
Sales director Stephen Patrick added: ''The ranges on show are the
result of exhaustive market research by our people. We have spent two
years researching the market and the products available. We believe that
these three ranges we are launching are the best available and meet
today's exacting standards.''
Visitors to the exhibition will also have the chance to visit Europe's
largest selection of quality refurbished office furniture in the
Claremont Centre, just across the road.

SCOTLAND team manager Craig Brown took the Aberdeen and Motherwell
players aside when the Scotland B squad gathered last night and assured
them that the weekend cup defeats had not ended their season, writes Ken
Gallacher.
Indeed, Brown sees the disappointments possibly opening up new
opportunities for some of the players who will be named today in his
team to play Northern Ireland at Easter Road tomorrow night.
He explained: ''Some of these players, particularly those from
Aberdeen and Motherwell, could now find themselves joining the full
international squad in Japan in May. We cannot take players over there
who are in the cup final.''
Aberdeen's Stephen Wright and Billy Dodds as well as Motherwell's
Steve Woods, Brian Martin, and Chris McCart could come into that
category.
Brown added: ''There are, of course, places still available for some
of them in Moscow. Martin, Hibs' Darren Jackson, and perhaps even Brian
O'Neil of Celtic come into that category.''
All three will play against the Irish. Motherwell keeper Woods and
Partick's Nicky Walker may be given a half-match each. Another who will
try to impress the manager is Millwall midfielder Alex Rae.

<HEADLINE>Cost of millions cause plans to be dropped.  A symbol of quality is sadly lost to Scotland</HEADLINE>

THE collapse of plans to introduce an internationally recognised
symbol which would be a mark of Scottish quality in food and drink
products is to be regretted. The idea was that the symbol -- whether it
be a thistle, heather, bagpipes or or a haggis -- would be a guarantee
of Scottish quality.
Eventually, however, it became clear that, operating on the world
scene, this venture was going to cost millions of pounds -- and private
enterprise was not coming up with its share.
Scottish Office Agriculture Minister, Sir Hector Monro, eventually
pulled the plug, pointing in particular to the lukewarm support from two
of the big players -- the Scotch whisky and salmon industries.
The Salmon Board, it appears, felt that they had already done a lot of
the hard work and their mark was better than anything that was likely to
be introduced on a communal basis.
The Scotch Whisky Association adopted a ''what's in it for us?''
stance. Not that they were opposed to the idea. It's just that their
members inhabit a hard commercial world where they are already spending
millions of pounds marketing individual brands world-wide. United
Distillers alone spend #300m a year.
While there is a good deal of support for the idea of quality marks
and assurance schemes one of the problems is that that market itself has
been overcrowded at times. We had the (now deceased) single food quality
mark which was estimated to require #19m over the next six years.
Other names which popped up in the course of laying out the corpse of
that scheme were the Scottish Food Strategy Group, the Scottish Food
Quality Certification Company, the Scottish Quality Farm Assurance
project, the Marketing Developments Scheme and the EC Processing and
Marketing Grant Scheme.
Quite separate from all of that is something called Scotland the
Brand. It was launched last October in a glossy presentation at Hopetoun
House with as one of its frontmen Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden, chairman
of United Distillers.
The aim is, briefly, to develop a quality brand image for Scotland and
all things Scottish. Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Tourist Board
are two of the big players in this scene.
At its launch the concept seemed airy-fairy but some practical results
are now apparently beginning to flow. A meeting in Edinburgh today will
set out the path for the future.
A pilot promotion in Paris next month will see a Scottish Tourist
Board visitor campaign linked in with promotions in Marks and Spencer's
Paris store -- pushing Scotch whisky, salmon, beef, shortbread and
biscuits. The two-pronged campaign will share the same visual material.
However, there is little point in having fancy logos and brand images
if the quality isn't there in the first place.
This, surely, is where the farm assurance schemes come into the
picture and it is unfortunate that the current schemes have met with
only limited success. Pig producers, who have been going through a bad
couple of years, are the stars on the quality assurance front with a 70%
uptake. Maybe hard times make quality guarantees a priority.
The beef and lamb producers come way behind at less than half that
figure. Those who have declined to sign up appear to be adopting the
''what's in it for us attitude.'' Why, they ask, should they go to the
expense of subscribing to a scheme, possibly adopting more expensive
work practices, accepting higher standards generally if, at the end of
the day there is no financial reward. They want to see a price premium
up front.
Charles Russell, convener of the NFUS field vegetable committee,
warned Fife farmers this week: ''It doesn't work that way. There is no
premium -- only a guarantee of a market. Remember that market is a
premium market. The alternative is no market.''
The Scottish Office is putting up #250,000 towards the compiling of a
code of practice manual for the various farm assurance schemes. It's a
far cry from the multi-million pound single quality mark campaign but is
aimed at a very practical proposition.
Wholesalers, supermarkets and consumers are all taking an increasing
interest in quality and in the use of hormones, pesticides and chemicals
generally. Those who cannot give assurances on these matters may find
themselves in a niche market not to their liking.

Doreen Taylor-Wilkie encounters dramas of the past
EACH time I go to Malta, I have the same feeling of astonishment that
an island of only 17 by nine miles, with two even smaller sisters, can
hold so much of interest, as well as relaxation and sheer enjoyment.
Malta is hard to beat for swimming and sub-aqua diving in the gentle
warm waters, so buoyant that even a nervous swimmer feels like a
champion, and every hotel has its own salt-water pool. But for me, it
has to be the sea, to look down at the fronds of seaweed waving below,
or put on a snorkel mask and hunt out the places where the sea eggs
hide. For scuba divers, one or two specialists hire sub-aqua gear or
arrange complete holidays, and many hotels rent masks and windsurfers.
The best place for diving is the south coast, dramatic and rocky,
where you can catch a boat to the Blue Grotto, a series of lofty,
iridescent sea caves, where the colours of the rocks show through in a
wash of greens, pinks, yellows, best seen as the morning sun slides into
the grotto. One of my favourite spots is Wied Zurrieq, a deep inlet
circled by rocks.
But Malta is much more than a modern-day playground, its recorded
history goes back to 2000BC, and even earlier when there was a land
bridge to Malta from North Africa. Since then, Malta has been fought
over, colonised, and left by Phoenicians, Romans, Carthaginians, and
more. The British were the last to arrive. For British visitors that has
left a bonus in the excellence of everyone's English and a similar sense
of humour between Maltese and British.
But those who left the most notable mark were the fighting order of
the Knights of St John, who built the massive sandstone ravelins (the
great yellow walls) around Valletta, and many of its finest buildings as
''auberges'' where the knights lived.
Valletta is a living history of the knights -- even their old Manoel
Theatre has been restored for performances. One of their greatest
masterpieces is the sixteenth-century Co-Cathedral of St John. Coming in
through the heavy doors, for a moment I am always blinded by the dim
interior, after the bouncing sunlight of the noisy square outside. Then
the rich decorations begin to emerge, and the chapels of the various
nationalities of knights along each side.
But to get the longest view of history, I like to stand on the Upper
Barrakka Gardens, atop the ravelins, which look down to one of the most
impressive stretches of water anywhere. Grand Harbour has been coveted
by all the fleets of the Mediterranean down the centuries, and fought
over in bitter strife.
In the Second World War, Maltese and British forces endured the
attacks by German and Italian planes and ships. Close by the harbour
entrance is Malta's latest monument, the Siege Bell, which commemorates
nearly 7000 who were killed during the Siege, nearly one-third of them
civilians. It hangs in an open-dome made of pale yellow Gozo stone.
The story of Malta's war is told in the War Museum housed at Fort St
Elmo nearby. In the doorway is an example of the E-boats (motor torpedo
boats) used to attack Malta, fought off by the Royal Malta Artillery,
and an old Gloster Gladiator aircraft, the survivor of three, Faith,
Hope and Charity, which were at first the only defensive aircraft on the
island.
To reach Malta's second island, Gozo, a ferry leaves from Cirkewwa on
the northernmost coast, where the dark blue Mediterranean is dotted with
swimmers, windsurfers, sails and motor boats, as the ferry takes the
short trip. Mellieha Bay further west on this same coast is a great
favourite for night-time swimming because you can wade out about
half-a-mile in safe waist-high water.
Gozo is old Malta, not so busy with building and change as the main
island. Above the great plain is the Citadel, where the Gozitans
defended themselves against regular raids by Mediterranean pirates. In
the heat, it is quite a pull up to the main Cathedral, inside the
Citadel, but worth it for the circular view of the island and the
Cathedral's lovely interior.
Something to marvel at is the interior dome, which is really an
optical illusion, achieved by painting. There is a fine statue of the
Madonna who comes out to be paraded through the streets for the annual
great ''festa'', with which even the smallest communities celebrate
their patron saints.
Also in Gozo are the Ggantija pre-historic temples, the stalactites of
the Alabaster Caves, and what is called the Azure Window, the only way
out of a small inland sea, trapped by a great wall of cliff, and a calm
winter anchorage for the local fishermen.

I'M AFRAID having the Breadwinner at home keeping me in order and
taking an interest in the farm instead of winning bread from the world
of computers isn't an unmitigated blessing. And I'm not just talking
about the money here.
She's not pleased with the new bull I bought at Perth last week. It's
not that his EBV wasn't high enough or anything like that. Its the name
she doesn't like.
Now it is true that when we bred bulls for the pedigree market we took
the utmost care of the choice of names. The names had to suggest that
the bull would be masculine without being aggressive. You wouldn't call
a bull Cyril, nor would you call it Cantona. And you would call a bull
Michael as in Michelangelo or Heseltine, rather than Mickey as in Mouse.
The last bull we bought at Perth was called Argus suggesting an outward
looking bull going forth to multiply.
But, having said that, it is just about the last thing I expected a
practical girl like the Breadwinner to worry about. And yet she is not
impressed.
And what is my latest herdsire called? What name follows in the proud
line from Columbus through Esquire and Tiberius?
Well, he's called Doodo, actually.
Come to think of it, I know what the Breadwinner means. I think we'll
call him Dod.
I have to admit that Dod was not impressed either. He arrived in a
blizzard and was stuck in a pen in an open-fronted shed with no straw in
it. He'd been dying for a drink and the water was frozen.
I soon got him nicely bedded, though, and I carried water from the
house for him. But where was his mash? And where was his fresh meadow
hay? He thinks two pounds of North Eastern cattle feeding nuts are a
poor do. And ammonia treated straw? He thinks I must be joking.
But the lad is fat. He was over fourteen hundredweights at thirteen
months old and he has to get into training for a summer's hard work. He
has forty-odd cows to see to on the first of June and he'll likely get a
baptism of fire on my neighbour Gowkie's braes for three weeks before
that.
So, in the snow last Wednesday, I took the Breadwinner out to have a
look at our new herdsire. I knew he would never look so well again.
Buying a bull at the bottom end of the trade seemed a long way from
the days when we won the Supreme Championship at Edinburgh with Ardo
Dante and followed that up a couple of years later with Figaro when they
moved the big sale to Perth.
We were having a dram in Dod's honour and feeling a wee bit nostalgic
when The Breadwinner let out a little squeal of the kind she used to
make when she was a girl and The Farmer had stolen her schoolbag. Her
eyes were shining and she had the catalogue open at Dod's page. ''He's a
grandson of Figaro!''
I wouldn't tell everyone but I hadn't noticed. So confused was I about
EBVs and trying to see why so average a bull had stuck at so far below
the average price, that I hadn't noticed.
But now I saw my chance. ''That was my little surprise darling,'' I
said. ''We haven't had much success with the Pedigree cattle in recent
years so I'm going back to our own breeding. I'm going back to Figaro.''
And you know, I didn't even blush.
Now here is a moral tale. If you're feeling like many farmers that the
pressure is on us just now because we've succeeded in providing enough
food for the country, you may enjoy it.
Once upon a time there was a little brown hen who found some grains of
wheat and called upon the other animals to help her sow them.
''Too tired,'' said the cow. ''Union rules,'' said the duck. ''Sore
back,'' said the horse. ''No environmental impact study done,'' said the
goose.
So the hen sowed the grain, tended it and harvested it. Then she
wanted a hand to make some bread. ''Still too tired,'' said the cow.
''At this time of night?'' said the duck. ''I'll lose my dole,'' said
the horse. ''I'm applying to become a Site of Special Scientific
Interest,'' said the goose.
So the hen baked five delicious loaves and showed them to the others.
''Give me some,'' they all said at once.
''No,'' said the little brown hen. ''I've done the work. Now I'll rest
a while.''
''Capitalist pig,'' bellowed the cow. ''What about the workers?''
demanded the duck. ''But my need is greater,'' said the horse.
''Multi-national agent for a uni-cellular society,'' taunted the goose,
though the little hen didn't feel very taunted as she had no idea what
that meant. The others painted picketing signs and paraded round the
little brown hen singing ''We shall overcome.''
And they were right. They did overcome. The farmer came to see what
all the commotion was about. ''Oh you selfish little hen,'' he said,
''there are no second class citizens here. You must learn to share.''
''But I worked hard for that bread.''
''Exactly,'' said the farmer. ''That is what free enterprise is about
these days. You are free to work as hard as you like. If you were on a
communist farm you'd have to give up all your bread, but here you are
free to share it with your needy companions.''
So they all lived happily ever after. Especially the goose. For she
got a big university research grant to find out why the little brown hen
gave up baking.

Patricia Fenn finds city slickers with rustic tendencies
AROUND the original three cities that through the centuries formed
Greater London -- London, Westminster and Southwark -- there grew a
circle of outlying villages. Many of them still exist, doggedly hanging
on to their compact rusticity, resisting encroachment, forming action
groups to retain their character. When Piccadilly and Oxford Street lose
their charm, retreat from their fumes and hassle to these green oases,
where the pace slows down and the natives are friendly.
Hampstead is London's best-known village. The famous heath
miraculously retains its endearing, slightly scruffy, untamed character,
preserving 790 acres of some of the most valuable land in the capital
from the property developer. Magnificent views above the tree tops
reveal a panorama of St Pauls and the city.
You can tramp for miles along the dirt tracks; no highwaymen today --
just the odd jogger and dog-walker. Take the path down to the ponds for
a swim perhaps, or cross to one of the most verdant parts of the heath,
Kenwood House, whose wooded grounds and lake are the idyllic setting for
summer concerts.
Shops in Heath Street, reflect the affluence and tastes of the
residents; no supermarkets here but patisseries, delis, wine bars,
boutiques, bookshops aplenty. In quiet cul-de-sacs and leafy squares are
Georgian terraces, countrified cottages. Look out for Flask Walk, Church
Row, Admirals Walk, Hollybush Hill for the kind of delightfully
unplanned variations of English architecture that so often gets
steam-rollered into uniformity in less attractive boroughs.
Blackheath is a total contrast with the surrounding urban sprawl. The
approaches are all up steep hills, so that the sudden vast open space of
the common always comes as a delightful shock. There is the duck pond
for Sunday afternoon sailing, and a rainbow of colour as kite-flyers
gather to show off their dexterity. Extend the walk to one of the most
beautiful of Georgian crescents, envying the eighteenth-century houses,
back to the village hub.
In Clapham, street after street of Victorian artisans' terraced houses
around the common has succumbed to yuppiedom, and the community is
beginning to disintegrate. However, in the wedge around Clapham Old
Town, the common vestiges of the old ways of life survive, with some
lovely old houses and a Georgian church.
The 205 acres of commonland, popular with marathon-trainers, au pairs
and toddlers, includes several ponds and children's amusements. The Olde
Windmill, a Victorian pub on the south side, is particularly popular
with alfresco refreshment.
Chiswick has two village centres, divided by the thundering Great West
Road. To the north fans out a sizeable green, church and a group of
small shops and bistros; sprawling along the riverbanks another
community, a haven centuries away from the motorway horrors.
The timbered crooked cottages of Church Street cluster around St
Nicholas church in what could be a film set of cobbled streets and
Victorian lamp posts. One of the most interesting of all river walks is
eastwards along Chiswick Mall, where the more modest dwellings house an
animated colony of artists, actors and writers. The popular pubs, the
Dove and The Ship, overlook the river nearer Hammersmith.
There's more to Kew than the famous gardens. Certainly a leisurely
wander around Capability Brown's 270 acres is a good enough reason for a
visit, but here too is one of the most attractive of London's villages.
The Rose and Crown, Kings Arms and Greyhound pubs all offer appealing
views of the village green and many a happy hour may be spent
contemplating the state of play on the cricket pitch. Tea at the Kew Tea
Rooms, just over Key Bridge, will round off this very British pastime.
Barnes has many focal points -- a village green, an expanse of heath
and a stretch of river. On Boat Race days the Bulls Head, a Victorian
pub famous for its jazz evenings, is even more packed than usual.
Upstream, the Terrace is a charming row of Regency houses, iron
balconies lavishly geraniumed. Pleasantly old-fashioned shops, art
galleries and wine bars cluster around the green, serving the
''villagers'', many of whom have seen their house prices rocket as the
desirability of their rustic setting attracts new money.
Wimbledon Common, once a desolate isolated wasteland, is now
appreciated for its extensive verdure, interesting ponds, and sports
areas. The name of Wimbledon, associated with the famous lawn tennis
club, has been taken in vain by a large surrounding suburban area, but
the real Wimbledon village is a relatively small confine of quiet leafy
roads, lined with dignified Edwardian houses, to the south of the
commons.
Its High Street is always lively with shoppers enjoying smart shops
and bistros. There's another little pocket of picturesque wooden houses
and cottage gardens around the Greyhound pub, a pleasant stroll across
the common.

<HEADLINE>Options which to help eradicate the costly pollution of silage</HEADLINE>

ONE of the major potential pollution risks on farm is silage. This is
in terms of both dirty water and silage effluent. Both can be difficult
and costly to control and both are high risk pollutants.
Are there any suitable alternatives to silage that will help to reduce
the level of risk of pollution and also reduce the capital investment
necessary for improved silage storage and waste control?
SAC has been involved in evaluating various options; higher dry-matter
silage, maize silage, whole crop cereals, straw and distillery
by-products. Not all are viable options in the west of Scotland and not
all fit into all farm systems and situations.
Let us consider the various options, where they fit and how viable
they are.
High Dry-Matter Silage: Wilting to produce a drier silage is an option
but carries with it two main problems, cost and risk. More machinery is
required to help increase the drying rate of the grass, involving a
greater investment in machinery. Also, the longer the interval between
cutting the grass and putting it into the pit, the greater the risk of
rainfall and the feed value of the crop being reduced.
Absorbents can be used to soak up some of the liquid effluent produced
from the grass. This will help to reduce the potential pollution risk
and will retain more of the feed value in the silage. Absorbents do,
however, have a cost.
Maize Silage: Forage maize can be grown successfully in the west of
Scotland. It does, however, require sunshine to allow the crop to grow,
a relatively long season to allow it to mature, and a dry autumn to
allow it to be harvested. All of these requirements occur together
perhaps two to three years out of ten in the west.
Maize silage fits well into all livestock systems and will produce
very little effluent; if it can be successfully grown.
Whole Crop Wheat is a relatively new concept where the whole cereal
crop, straw and grain is made into silage and preserved naturally or
with the use of additives. With both systems a dry material is produced
with no risk of effluent.
Cereals can be grown successfully on most farms although yield has a
large impact on the viability of the crop. Contractors are usually used
to harvest and ensile the crop. Whole crop can fit into most farming
situations but will be less financially viable with beef and sheep
systems.
Straw is an option for some beef systems and for housed sheep,
although it is often considered to be an expensive commodity. However,
if all the costs involved with both hay and silage feeding systems are
taken into account, straw can be competitive.
Distillery By-Products can be considered to be alternatives to silage
-- particularly Grainbeet, a mix of draff and sugar beet pulp,
researched and developed by SAC. By-products fit well into all systems,
their main problem, however, being their supply and therefore cost.
Alternatives to silage, or the opportunity to replace some of the
silage made, do exist. There is, therefore, on most farms, scope to
reduce the potential risk of pollution. This has obvious benefits for
the environment and can also reduce costs to the farmer.
David Mowat is SAC agricultural adviser at Dumfries.

ALAN McLaren, free from suspension, returns to Tynecastle on cup
business this evening, but Hearts are planning a traumatic night for
him. His former team-mates are under instruction to reach out and take
advantage of a home tie in the quarter-finals.
The Tennents Scottish Cup holders, Dundee United, were drawn away to
the winners of Hearts' tie against Rangers, whose manager Walter Smith
is contemplating at least a couple of changes.
One, of course, will be the re-introduction of McLaren, but John Brown
and Trevor Steven are fit again and Smith is sure to accommodate one of
them, probably the Englishman, if he does not suffer any adverse
reaction from training yesterday.
''Trevor was looking as though he was getting a bit of real form
back,'' Smith said yesterday.
Hearts manager Tommy McLean has to wait for checks on Dave McPherson,
John Millar, and Neil Berry, but hopes to have two of them available,
with Berry the most doubtful.
McLean said: ''It will be important that we start the game in the
right frame of mind. In other words, we intend having a go.''
Quarter-final draw:
Celtic v Kilmarnock, Rangers or Hearts v Dundee United, Raith Rovers v
Airdrie, Stenhousemuir v Hibernian.

<HEADLINE>Centre's cheekbone fractured in last ruck of Paris victory Jardine surgery blow to Scots</HEADLINE>

IAN JARDINE, the Stirling County centre, was due to undergo surgery at
the City Hospital in Edinburgh last night to repair a depressed fracture
of the right cheekbone, sustained in the final minute of Scotland's
brave and historic victory at the Parc des Princes on Saturday.
Jardine, who went straight to hospital after the plane carrying the
team home from Paris touched down at Edinburgh Airport, will be out of
the game for six to eight weeks.
He was unable to attend the after-match banquet, but was still around
the team hotel when the jubilant Scots, who had earned a famous and
well-deserved victory that ended 26 years of defeat on French soil,
returned to meet up with wives and girlfriends and paint the town blue.
Scotland's squad for the World Cup in South Africa this summer is due
to be picked on March 21. Jardine, who played his best game in Scottish
colours in Paris, is now a crucial component in the game plan, and the
selectors will be monitoring his progress closely.
The injury happened in the last ruck of the game, when the 18st 7lbs,
6ft 10ins French lock Olivier Brouzet charged in and made contact on
Jardine's cheek with his head.
Jardine said later that he did not think the injury had been caused
deliberately. ''The guy just wiped me out at the ruck. He came in with
his head and that was it. I knew right away that it was a bad injury.''
SRU chief executive Bill Hogg said no official action was contemplated
by the Union. The player had expressed the view that he did not think
Brouzet's head-butt had been deliberate.
However, Murrayfield officialdom will no doubt wish to take a closer
look at the incident on video.
Brouzet's action may not have been malicious, but it was certainly
reckless and follows a similar incident in the French game against Wales
when Grenoble lock Olivier Merle head-butted Welsh prop Ricky Evans, who
fell awkwardly as a result and broke a leg.
Scotland prop Peter Wright said after Saturday's game that charging in
with the head down was a French characteristic and one which opponents
would be well advised to guard against.
''You really do have to look out for yourself. They come in head first
and try to sweep you away. I try to get an arm or an elbow up in front
of my face so they can't do much damage.
''I don't think it's malicious, it's just the way they play,'' said
the prop, who had a magnificent game at the Parc des Princes.
The Scottish selectors meet tomorrow to pick the team to play Wales at
Murrayfield on Saturday week. An announcement will be made on Wednesady.
Manager Duncan Paterson has already indicated that former
international winger Tony Stanger, now converted to the centre, had been
occupying selectorial minds for the French game. He will now come into
the reckoning, along with Paris replacement Graham Shiel and the
keen-to-return Scott Hastings.
The other injury-induced area of debate for the selectors concerns
lock. Damian Cronin, who damaged elbow ligaments in Paris, will be out
for four weeks.
Doddie Weir, who came on as a replacement, was a more than able
substitute, but GHK's Shade Munro and, even, the Scotland A lock Robb
Scott, of London Scottish, could also get the call.
Otherwise, the selectors are likely to name the same side for the
Welsh match.
Craig Joiner is still learning his international trade on the right
wing, and as a result can sometimes look vulnerable on the retreat.
He possesses real pace, though, which is a priceless commodity and not
one to be discarded wantonly.
This Scotland side, beginning with Canada, have now scored three
victories on the trot. A win against Wales would mean they would travel
to Twickenham on March 18 for the Grand Slam showdown with England.
They are not, though, allowing Grand Slam fever to cloud their
thoughts. Gavin Hastings, who continues to enthral and amaze and to
confound the diminishing band of critics, said after Saturday's game:
''We can take an awful lot of confidence from this match, but the
games ahead only get tougher. The next one against Wales will be the
toughest yet.
''This Scotland side has loads of character and has risen to the
challenge every time. But every time it gets harder and, make no
mistake, Wales will be the hardest yet.''
Coach Dougie Morgan said his men had scored an outstanding achievement
at the Parc des Princes. ''For a side to come back the way they did
after the try in the first couple of minutes was a major achievement.
''I said that records were there to be beaten, and we have broken it.
The icing on the cake was Gavin's try and his winning conversion.
''That was just tremendous for us and tremendous for Gavin, especially
in Paris, where we haven't won for 26 years.''

WHEN it has been decided by an elderly person and their family, that
the time has come when a move into a retirement or nursing home is the
best course of action, there often follows a period of turmoil as
everyone agonises over finding the right home. The final choice is
extremely important, and how to go about this selection process is not
always understood.
The majority's wish is to stay in their own home for as long as
possible. This can be quite workable, as long as there are sums to pay
for the services required: cleaning, cooking, someone to sit during the
day or night, or a housekeeper/companion who lives-in. It is also
possible to get back-up from social services -- for which you may have
to pay -- such as home help and home care, meals-on-wheels, day centre
care.
Sheltered housing is another relatively new phenomenon in the private
sector, but it can work very well for some people who are able to live
independently, yet within the comforting structure of having a
warden/call alarms for back-up, should help be needed. Age Concern
Scotland, which has a wide range of excellent fact sheets, has one
entitled Sheltered and Retirement Housing for Sale in Scotland which
provides a range of questions for those proposing to buy such a
property.
If a home has been decided on as the best option, the family GP may be
able to give some advice -- certainly in terms of the kind of home
required. A residential or retirement home will be registered with the
local authority, and doesn't offer nursing care, whereas a nursing home
will be registered with the area health board, and will offer nursing
services. Recommendation by others who are themselves in a home, or who
have family there, is always useful.
When seeking a home, it's a good idea to get a younger family member
who knows you well, to do a preliminary ''sweep'' to identify possible
options. The person who is going to live there, can then go along to
make their own assessment, and to make sure that the ''feel'' of the
place is right for them.
Choice is a very personal decision, what suits one may not suit
someone else at all. Age Concern Scotland's leaflet Finding Residential
and Nursing Home Accommodation, guides the reader carefully and clearly
through the thinking processes. It covers the types of care homes; how
to find one for a very disabled or mentally frail person; the questions
to ask when choosing a home; paying for residential or nursing home
care; contracts and many other relevant aspects.
Visiting the homes which interest you, talking to staff and residents,
and seeing what everyone is up to, the importance of getting your
questions answered and seeing exactly what the atmosphere is like, can't
been over emphasised. Is it a homely place, warm and with a busy buzz?
And the staff: are they involved with the residents, interested and
caring?
Further questions which might be asked: is residents' independence
encouraged, and do they make choices about as many areas of their lives
as they can? Can they bring personal possessions such as some furniture
and pictures? Do they have the choice of single or shared rooms and do
they have a say about with whom they share?
Paying for care is another whole, complex area of its own, if you seek
help with these. Age Concern's factsheet will answer questions on this
aspect and set you on the right lines.
Write to Age Concern Scotland at 54A Fountainbridge, Edinburgh EH3
9PT, enclosing a large, self-addressed envelope, requesting the relevant
Factsheets -- they'll send up to five free of charge -- although if
anyone can afford a small donation, it is always welcome.
Factsheet No 2 is Sheltered and Retirement Housing for Sale; No 6 is
Finding Help at Home; No 10 Local Authority Charging Procedures for
Residential and Nursing Home Care; No 29 Finding Residential and Nursing
Home Accommodation; No 32 Disability and Aging: Your Rights to Social
Services.
When a loved relative develops dementia, a gradual role reversal takes
place, which is hard for the carer to come to terms with emotionally as
well as physically.
Providing invaluable support, 24-hours, seven-days a week throughout
the week, is the Dementia Helpline, run by Alzheimer's Scotland --
Action of Dementia. The number, 0131 220 6155, is staffed by trained
volunteers who can provide information and the comfort of understanding,
as well as helping people make contact with the appropriate local
services. A free information pack is also available through the same
telephone number.
A spread of benefits may be available to help both the sufferer and
his or her carer. Find out about these by ringing the Freephone Social
Security number: 0888 666 555. Local Citizens' Advice Bureaux will also
be able to give advice.
One of the hardest things for carers to bear along with the sadness,
is the sense of isolation and loneliness that looking after someone with
dementia brings. Unlike looking after small children going through
difficult stages, where there is a comfort that as they get a little
older, life will become easier, with dementia the prognosis holds no
promise of better times ahead.
Trying to cope entirely alone is not the answer, indeed, it is an
impossible task. There is help and support available -- find out about
it and don't give up at the first hurdle. Sometimes it can be an uphill
struggle to get things organised satisfactorily. Remember though, you
are not alone, and a call to the Helpline can bring not just valuable
advice but strengthening support too.

A HEAVY lorry filled with British goods left Paisley for Russia
yesterday, the ''Iron Curtain-raiser'' on a $2m (#1.27m) trade agreement
resulting from talks between academics.
The 35-tonne vehicle, filled with everything from football boots to
video recorders, will make the 3000-mile round trip from Paisley
University to Yaroslavl, near Moscow.
It is the largest legally allowed to travel on European roads and
contained the first consignment of a $2m Russian procurement order
secured by Frank McGlinn, a Greenock and Renfrew-based self-employed
businessman.
The agreement grew out of talks between Paisley University staff John
Struthers and John Wylie and academics at Yaroslavl University, on
setting up a small business centre in the Russian region.
Later, while the Russian academics were in Scotland, they were
introduced to Mr McGlinn.
The businessman said an excellent relationship had been established
with the Russians, whose countrymen had their fingers burned by
unscrupulous traders when the Iron Curtain first came down.
Mr Wylie, external relations director at Paisley University, said:
''This is a fine example of how the university and Scottish companies
are able to work together to produce trade opportunities, not only in
Scotland but overseas as well.
''We are delighted that our pioneering work has paid off so quickly.''
The goods will be sold to the Russian people by local companies set up
by Yaroslavl University.

Clare Henry takes a trek round the Tramway to see, and more
importantly read, the works of conceptual artist, theorist, and
philosopher Stephen Willats -- and finds it a long haul
GLASGOW'S Tramway has led a chequered and controversial life. In 1990
it was an internationally known, albeit temporary, venue. Then it closed
down, due to the city council's faint heart and a precarious west wall.
Re-opened for almost two years now, it still wrestles with problems of
image, identity, and balance. While its performance programme was
quickly established, courtesy of Peter Brookes's Mahabarata, the visual
arts have always been hampered by sporadic and uneven programming; the
menu too esoteric for some, too safe for others.
Now, fears Charles Esche, director of exhibitions, it's in danger of
being bureaucratised. ''The changes in management structure and
nightmare staffing situation go hand in hand with a desire to
centralise. I'm fighting being moved to an office in George Street. I
need to be on the spot.''
Tramway's exhibition visitor figures are nothing to shout about but
they are improving -- and its location is difficult despite being next
to Pollokshields East Station.
When Esche arrived in 1993 the visual arts programme had virtually
vanished. His key contribution has been to show Glasgow's newest (and
neglected at home) high fliers, artists like Christine Borland and
Fullbright fellow Jackie Donnachie, alongside international figures.
The current show features Stephen Willats: theorist, philosopher,
conceptual artist, and for 30 years, dogged pioneer of interactive art.
OK, if you fancy several hours on your feet reading; not so good if you
can't afford the catalogue to take home and to peruse on your knee. Even
Esche admits its heavy going. ''I wouldn't expect anyone to stand and
read it all, even me! We had a choice -- a comprehensive museum
retrospective or a sparse hang of a few seminal works. As Willats had
not been shown in Scotland before, and especially as Glasgow doesn't
have a museum that's in any way serious about contemporary work, we
chose the comprehensive approach.''
Living Together focuses on relationships and their many subtle facets.
Willats began producing social art in 1961 when he studied the
disciplines of cybernetics, information theory, systems analysis,
semiotics, and the behavioural sciences at Ealing Art School before
working as a lab assistant at Systems Research.
This background explains his obsession with diagrams, arrows, and
scientific or sociological jargon. Lives, be they in 1970s tower blocks,
suburbia or punk clubs, are reduced to banal letterset slogans and
categories or flow charts. At best he observes; mostly he preaches his
form of utopia. Paradoxically, for someone interested in interaction,
participation, and collaboration he can take a distinctly dogmatic and
dictatorial line. Happily no set pattern emerges whether these
''acquaintances, colleagues, comrades, enemies, friends, neighbours,
opponents, partners, rivals, strangers, and supporters'' are scrutinised
in London, Rome, or Hamburg.
Willats began as an austere and rigorous analyst. His ruler, compass,
and pen outlined conceptual diagrams of geometric worlds in parallel or
in high-rise buildings. By the 1970s he was mapping the anthropology of
every day life via black and white photographs of office workers,
widows, and single parents, folk dressed in flares living in flats.
He describes their hopes and dreams (''I don't want to be your
domestic slave,'' says one liberated 1970s girl, ''I want the freedom to
break into a man's world''), and also their living rooms: a teenager and
radio; mother plus iron; man and briefcase. If nothing more, Willats
provides scrupulous historical and social documentation of dated
everyday objects -- typewriter, phone, car, calculator, tea tray,
cigarettes -- in their contemporary setting. The result is sadly
stereotyped; a period piece.
In 1993 Willats explored the body language of friendship in different
cultures in a series called Random Life. As his photos demonstrate,
Italian men hug while Northern Europeans are aloof and less convivial.
This interest in the random also produced Democratic Grid: patterns
established by 200 throws of the dice. The red, yellow, green, and
purple squares are a welcome splash of colour in this monochrome
display.
Museum Mosaic, a black and white grid wall, aims for audience
participation but, from what I can see, fails to involve people. No
wonder, with instructions and questionnaires like income tax returns or
DHSS forms. The slide show documenting Willats's community projects is
also dull and worth avoiding.
So what does Willat tell us? Sadly not a lot. We already know
relationships are difficult, form-filling is off-putting, and that
people look uncomfortable in boxes.
Willats presents the 1970s and 80s as being a grey affair, full of
dull people leading boring lives. I don't remember it like that at all.
This sober, downbeat diagramatics show has all the worst tendencies of
an academic's research thesis and none of the buccaneering swing of the
anarchic artist.
Art as an agent for change can play an important role in the uncertain
1990s but, to be effective, needs careful handling. Artist as tabulator
is not for me, nor I guess, for Joe Public. Get your message across,
sure, but don't bore us to death doing so.
* Mary Brennan discusses the future of Tramway with Glasgow's director
of performing arts and venues, Bob Palmer, in Thursday's Herald Arts.

Music
ALEXANDER Balanescu's string quartet is like no other. The fact that
they are an amplified quartet might suggest comparisons with the Smith
or Kronos Quartets. Hardly. The Balanescu Quartet is nearer a rock or
jazz genre, playing in-yer-face music. Their performance style is almost
deliberately anti-sophisticated -- they pound their instruments, leader
Balanescu himself shredding the hairs on his violin bow.
The repertoire in their late show at the Queen's Hall on Saturday
night was drawn from their latest album, Luminitza, all group
compositions and heavily influenced by Balanescu's Romanian background.
While it's inevitable that, on a return visit to his homeland, the big
violinist should have been touched by recent historical and political
events, the weakest of his compositions are those that are themselves
overtly political.
In tracks such as Democracy or Revolution, both of which featured
Balanescu as narrator as well as violinist, attempts at irony failed to
mask a kind of embarrassing pseudo-political rhetoric.
Stick to the music, Alex, is the message. The group was at strength in
music where the folk rhythms of Balanescu's native country were filtered
through his post-minimalist, heavy, driving style: the results, a bit
like Bartok writ large and loud, were always impressive, infectious, and
-- whether in epic numbers such as the optimistic four-movement title
track of the album, or the haunting lament, Mother -- often moving.
Good turn out (cult-type crowd) for this Assembly Direct promotion.

Music
BARTOK'S Concerto for Orchestra, first heard 50 years ago, sent shock
waves through the audience when it reached the Edinburgh Festival in
1948. But on Saturday, with Yakov Kreizberg as conductor, it purred
along as smoothly and unchallengingly as the Haydn symphony and Mozart
violin concerto that preceded it.
If the intention was to homogenise Bartok's abrasive genius, it
certainly worked. But then, by Bartok's own rigorous standards, the
Concerto for Orchestra -- if we are prepared to admit it -- has always
seemed something of a soft sell, and the Royal SNO's performance was
undeniably seductive, with a swaying lilt in the first movement, an
atmospheric ebb and flow, that deprived it of its core of steeliness.
Kreizberg, Russian-born, American-trained, and soon to take charge of
the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, made the whole work sound a bit like
ballet music, which was perhaps not so wide of the mark. Bartok's links
with Stravinsky were certainly underlined, and rhythms keenly
articulated.
Haydn's 88th symphony was similarly well sprung. But though the
orchestra looked disconcertingly string-laden, Kreizberg ensured that
the important wind parts cut through the upholstery. Mozart's G major
violin concerto, K216, on the other hand, proved all a bit too
innocuously dainty, its cutting edge satinised, its vitality suppressed.

THE time she spent singing with a showband on the same bill as Wayne
County was not wasted on Cyndi Lauper. As well as revisiting her own
hits, on Saturday she served up the Big O's last hit, I Drove All Night,
and the New Orleans classic, Iko Iko. This was no slick packaging of her
finest moments, but rather a leisurely stroll (over more than two hours)
though her back pages, spiced with anecdotes and audience interaction.
It was so charming, you could overlook the gawky dancing and lumpen
cover of Marvin Gaye's What's Goin' On.
For one of the straightest-looking crowds I have seen at a rock gig
(OK, I wasn't at Clapton) she -- in her glengarry, shock of yellow hair,
and tartan minidress with mini-bustle -- allows indulgence in vicarious
outrageousness. They rewarded her with a single red rose and chocolates.
When the security staff declined to allow dancing in the aisles, the
audience complained to the wild woman and she had her road manager sort
the problem out before announcing: ''You can dance if you're nice and
don't trash the joint.'' We were and we didn't.
But then so is she really. She recruited a young mascot who was
perched on the edge of the stage (Corinne, aged seven or eight and
word-perfect) for the now anthemic Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, and
brought back support act McAlmont for the sublime Time After Time --
served up as a folky dulcimer-and-fiddle duet. He's a camp Terence Trent
D'Arby with a voice like Chrissie Hynde and a less obvious taste in
covers. Kevin Ayres's hippy whimsy with a funk back-beat? Weird.

Theatre
EVERY now and then you come across something special, an experience to
remember and cherish. The Sunday night performance at the Tron Theatre
by the Rachmaninov Trio was one such musical event.
A purist might have been initially tempted into prejudging a programme
consisting largely of single movements and short pieces chosen from a
wide compass of composers ranging through Tchaikovsky, Schumann, Brahms,
and Debussy among others, but the resulting effect easily justified the
selection.
What made the whole thing special, however, was not the choice of
works but that spark of pure joyous music-making that crackled between
these three players.
At the heart of this trio's magic is the very special rapport between
Lev Atlas and Alexander Volpov, built up together in their former
existence in the Rostov String Quartet. Whatever the piece, whoever the
composer, their intuitive mutual understanding was a pure delight.
Here were musicians clearly enjoying what they played and inviting us
to share the pleasure with them.
They bared Tchaikovsky's angst, twinkled up Glinka's ear for a good
tune, engulfed us in a rush of Romanticism from Debussy.
Just to show they could also play a bit on their own, Volpov and Atlas
each took a turn at centre stage to showcase their virtuosity. Volpov
charmed with pieces by Prokofiev and Tzintzade that were charged with
humour while later Atlas seduced with the lyricism of Brahms'
Sonatensatz. And then there was Phillip Silver whose sensitive piano
playing was a perfect foil to his partners. Altogether an evening to
remember.

IT was a pleasure for The Herald's Euro-chap to show the Moderator
around the European Parliament's Starship Enterprise, aka the press
room, last week in Strasbourg. The Rt Rev Dr James Simpson was on a tour
of Europe and took in the monthly plenary before moving on to Brussels.
On his travels he visited Geneva, one of the world's richest cities.
Earlier, he told me, he had been to Malawi, one of the world's poorest
countries. Like any man of conscience who has seen a bit of the Third
World, especially the poorer African parts of it, he was obviously
chilled by the contrast in living standards.
His concern about the downward spiral of affairs in Africa coincides
with the growing crisis in Europe's relations with the so-called ACP
countries. These are African, Caribbean and Pacific states, mostly
European nations' former colonies, who are recipients of the world's
biggest aid programme.
The aid is negotiated under the terms of the Lome Convention, so
called because it was signed in Lome, Togo, 20 years ago. The current
convention, involving an aid-and-trade package, is the fourth version
and is in mid-term. It is also the means by which rich Europeans keep
millions of poor Africans -- and others -- alive. Simple as that.
Anyone who has spent time in Africa knows the problem. Early in the
independence era most African states performed quite well -- for a
while. In 1974 the oil shock helped to cripple most of their economies.
Communism ruined a few more. Many of these stricken countries have the
highest birth rates in the world. In East Africa the population has
almost trebled in 25 years. No economy can live with that.
As the mainly sub-Sahara states slid into chaos and brutality a few
politicians became rich. Some, like Mobutu of Zaire, adopted the
expedient philosophy of treating all national resources as their
personal wealth. Zaire is now a typical African economic dustbowl.
Against this grisly background the EU now considers it cannot go on
giving help to the 70 ACP states which most need it. Last week Britain,
Germany, Netherlands and Italy, who jointly put up 60% of the previous
development fund, rejected efforts to increase aid to #10.5 billion from
#8.6 billion. This money is put together under the EU umbrella by the
member states. The parliament adds to the total EU effort by Brussels
with funds under the political direction of Mrs Glenys Kinnock in her
new life as a Euro-MP committed to helping Third World development.
Mrs Kinnock is, naturally, shocked at the latest turn in events which
in the words of John Corrie, formerly a Scots Tory MP who now represents
an English Euro-seat, means the Lome Convention could be dead within a
few years. ''I very much doubt we will see another Lome after the year
2000,'' he remarked last week.
Other British Tories are ashamed of the parsimonious approach of their
own Government and that of the Germans. Lord Plumb, leader of the
British Euro-Tories, has protested to the leadership in London.
Mrs Kinnock believes the threat to reduce Lome funding is ''absolutely
disastrous''. She argues that even if aid to the ACP states was reduced
to accommodate shameless self-interest -- barring the poorest immigrants
whose plight compels them to seek a life in Europe -- it should be
increased, not reduced.
''All this is another step backwards, another aspect of Britain
pulling out of the European mainstream,'' Mrs Kinnock concludes.
She is supported in that view by the French whose foreign minister,
Alain Juppe, went ballistic when the aid negotiations broke down, mainly
because of Britain. He lambasted Britain and said we were now calling
into question ''the very concept of belonging to the EU''.
Tightening the rules is a reasonable requirement, as Mrs Kinnock
agrees. ''Better evaluation and more monitoring are necessary,'' she
says, ''but there must also be easier access to essential funding.''
As the ACP states argue for more, Britain says it wants to reduce the
EU's role by channelling aid directly into projects it deems worthwhile.
Lady Linda Chalker's sweet talk is not hard to decipher.
''I very much hope that we can soon put this current debate . . .
behind us and get on with the job of enhancing the economic and social
prospects of our partners among the ACP, as well as improving EU aid
targeting, disbursement rates and effectiveness,'' quoth she.
Put another way: ''Listen, I've got a great wheeze for saving millions
. . .''
Britain's credibility would be more plausible if the Government did
not have such a record of grudging aid. At least the Germans are honest
about it: as the biggest EU donors they want to make sure their nearest
neighbours, the East European states awaiting EU membership, are helped
out first. If the victims are the world's poorest people, so be it.
The French are also beginning to look more closely at their own
interests. They are transfixed by the unfolding horror of Algeria and
determined the North African Mediterranean states must be given a better
deal. Better security along the EU's southern borders and more money for
north Africa could reduce the political volatility of the region.
To this unhappy trend, one African minister, Mr Themba Masuku of
Swaziland, remarked gloomily: ''We are left in the middle of the ocean
with no resources . . . democracy cannot succeed in a climate of
poverty.''
I leave you to consider this fact which came from a shaken Lord Plumb
last week after he returned from a tour of Africa's horrors which
include the Aids disaster. Almost half of all new-born African babies
are now thought to be infected.
What can you say?

THE NAKED PILOT
By David Beaty
Airlife Publishing, #12.95
SHORTLY before 8pm on January 8, 1989, a British Midland Boeing 737
took off from Heathrow bound for Belfast. The onboard computer was
programmed to take the aircraft north up Airway Bravo Three towards the
Daventry control area.
As it was climbing through 28,300ft the whole airframe began to shake.
Smoke and fumes filled the flight deck. The instruments covering the
engine known variously as number one, left and port fluctuated. There
had been fatigue failure of a fan blade.
Yet, for a reason he was never able fully to explain, the first
officer told the captain that the problem was with the right engine and
it was throttled back while an emergency landing at East Midlands
airport was planned.
Three of the cabin staff and many of the passengers had seen fire and
smoke coming from the left engine but kept their confusion to
themselves.
Minutes later the fire bell sounded and desperate attempts were made
to restart the right engine which had been serviceable all along. It was
too late and at 8.24pm the aircraft ploughed into the western bank of
the M1. A total of 47 people died.
Various recommendations were made by the report of the Air Accident
Investigation Branch yet, as David Beaty argues in this book, the
fundamental issue of why human error occurs in aviation accidents is
still not fully understood.
Worse, says the former military and civil pilot turned psychologist
and writer, insufficient research is being done; the human factor is
still too low on the list of priorities of the world's airlines.
This book, just published in paperback, is scrupulously researched and
while some readers may feel Beaty's detailed descriptions of the world's
air disasters from the R101 to Lockerbie and beyond border on
sensationalism, there is no doubt that they help to make his point.
In the British Midland disaster, the captain was retired due to ill
health and his first officer dismissed. Beaty points out, however, that
laterality confusion, or mixing left and right, happens to everyone and
he argues that technical advances should protect pilots from themselves.
This is not a read for the white-knuckle flier, and one cannot see it
doing huge business in the airport bookstalls for, as well as the
graphic descriptions of death and destruction, the picture painted of
the modern pilot is not a pretty one.
We read of overbearing martinets unwilling to listen to advice or
criticism. They are often unable to sleep because of disturbed rest
patterns. There is a deleterious effect on their sexual performance.
He (the slow progress of women in flying forces the writer to refer to
males throughout) may be an intuitive extrovert with an over-active
masculine personality, but like most of us, he carries a huge emotional
baggage of family squabbles and thwarted ambitions up the aircraft
steps.
The world's worst air disaster, when two Boeing 747 Jumbo jets
collided on the runway at Tenerife Airport in March 1977 killing 583,
was a story of breathtaking human error as one aircraft hurtled down the
runway without take-off clearance as another desperately tried to get
clear.
Beaty writes: ''The cause of the accident clearly pointed to those
factors most difficult to quantify -- the human factors . . . perhaps
the most important factors were the captain's egotism and his
prestige.''
As well as the factors which affect us all from time to time --
stress, fatigue, boredom -- the modern pilot, or more specifically the
captain, suffers from a burden as old as flying itself.
He has long been considered to be ''under God alone'' when he sits in
the left-hand seat of his aeroplane, and many wearers of the four gold
stripes still take a dim view of subordinate staff, in cockpit or cabin,
questioning a decision he has made.
Time after time, reports Beaty as he chronicles accidents world-wide,
lives could have been saved if a co-pilot, flight engineer or member of
cabin crew had made it clear to the skipper he was very wrong.
He concedes that many airlines have grasped the nettle with improved
training which involves both flight and cabin crew working together more
closely on safety aspects.
Beaty says that after Tenerife elements of the aviation industry made
tentative moves towards understanding the human factors and that their
study is being embraced by airlines and indeed is blossoming into an
industry. He adds: ''Even so, there had been and still is an
understandable resistance to that study in that we all tend to deny
making mistakes in a society that blames and demands heavy penalties
from those of us who do make them, especially ones with huge financial
implications such as those resulting in an aircraft accident.''
Beaty calls for a stronger Air Accident Investigation Branch, making
it an accident prevention as well as accident investigation agency and
employing a wider range of experts in such fields as pathology,
psychology and ergonomics.
In addition he would like to see a responsibility being placed on
every pilot to report every incident, however small, so that a
world-wide data bank could be set up and patterns studied.
All is not gloom for the frequent flier though, despite the facts that
air accidents are devastating, and more than 70% are due to human
factors. Flight safety has improved to such a point that recent figures
indicate that there are 1.8 fatal crashes per million take-offs, and
even then a passenger would have a 50% chance of survival.
Beaty sees the human factor pervading the whole aviation structure and
not just pilots, and concludes: ''From tackling that will come the
breakthrough that will enable us at last to conquer the last great
frontier in aviation.''

THERE is pretty well only one thing that Cabinet Ministers can now do
to prevent the disintegration of this Government. One and all they must
say on all occasions: ''The Prime Minister speaks for the Cabinet. What
he says goes.'' Without consistent expressions of trust in Mr Major,
they merely dig themselves a deeper hole.
Unfounded protestations of unity are derisory. If ministerial unity
existed, and manifestly so, why was it necessary for the 1922 Executive,
the elected representatives of Tory backbenchers, to demand it of the
Prime Minister? Why did he feel obliged to require it of his Thursday
Cabinet two days later? Why did Mr Major, after being mocked by Mr Blair
in the Commons, go on to a Tory dinner that night to declare: ''Enough
is enough. We have an agreed policy on Europe and people should stick to
espousing that rather than being drawn into fruitless debate.''
He was addressing the party ultra-faithful, the National Union of
Conservative Associations, and they were particularly cheered when he
added: ''If we are not all able to say the same thing, then quite a lot
of people are going to have to say nothing at all.''
It should not have been necessary for the Prime Minister to bar his
Cabinet from ''speculative debate''. For one thing, it betrays an
underlying weakness in his position in his party and the country. For
another, his lecture suggests that his supposedly senior colleagues are
either inexperienced politicians or petulant or so split and
disheartened by his leadership that they are jostling for personal
position.
What is this all about? If I were a Tory diehard supporter I would
have to force a grin in order to hold back the tears. Mr Major's policy
about a single European currency in, say, four, 10, or 15 years, seems
sensible. He has a treaty-negotiated agreement that the UK does not have
to commit itself until 1999.
If the Treaty of Maastricht is meaningless, then so is the founding
Treaty of Rome itself. Deeds, not aspirations, are what count in what is
now the European Union. The history of its development provides many
examples. Stated wishes do not always represent the private views and
objectives of member-governments.
He therefore takes the view that it is wise to wait and see. That is
to say, wait until all the fine Euro-words come to the point of action
and then see if it suits Britain to join in. Meanwhile, without
commitment, we are involved in our partners' deliberations on how a
single currency might be achieved.
It is a pragmatic approach and a cautious one bearing in mind our
disastrous commitment of sterling to the Exchange Rate Mechanism. It
reflects a Tory scepticism throughout the party about the actual ability
of the 15 member states to organise a single currency, even if they
still want one years hence.
But will elements of the Government and parliamentary party allow the
Prime Minister to leave it at that? They will not, or at least up to now
they have not given him sufficient trust in his judgment. They want him
to say ''never'' to a single currency and they want him to commit
himself to a referendum.
Under pressure, Mr Major has conceded that he will consider a
referendum. It is certainly true that a single currency (and a central
bank) is likely to have profound constitutional implications,
particularly in Scotland where the clamour for a devolved parliament
does not abate. There is a link between economic and political union.
Decisions on the latter are at least two years away. What is the point
of entering summit negotiations at all if you are going to announce your
bottom line so far in advance? Who can tell two years ahead what
governments are going to be in power among the member nations, and what
their negotiating positions are going to be? Mr Major recognises this in
UK domestic terms when he states that a parliament (and a government?)
other than this one will have to decide.
The Tories have been behaving with the utmost folly seeking to
proscribe, one way or another, their Prime Minister's future policy.
They do it because they think that he is less robust about Europe than
their last leader, who they sacked.
By comparison, the Labour Party has been conducting itself with
considerable adroitness. Mr Blair has been allowed the comparative
luxury of silence from his Euro-sceptics who have similarly strong
concerns about federalism. He is permitted by his party the wait-and-see
policy that the Tories deny their leader. It is, perhaps, the crucial
difference between a party hungry for power and one that has taken power
for granted for too long.
The Tories fear that if Blair gets to power he will commit the UK
irrevocably to a Brussels-knows-best policy on the basis of what used to
be called by Margaret Thatcher ''socialism by the back door''. As things
stand, Mr Blair fully expects to be able to introduce socialism by the
front door after the next election, aided by Tory disunity.
Mr Major's rebels seem blithely unaware of the paradox; that by
continually undermining their Prime Minister, the Tories increase the
possibility of Mr Blair fulfilling his expectations. Furthermore, Mr
Major's strategy of painting Blair and Labour as Brussels' clones has
been blown by Tory disunity. It is impossible for him successfully to
expose Labour doubts and divisions on the issue until he has found unity
in his own party.
This will not be possible given the stance -- perverse in party
political terms -- adopted by Tory troublemakers within and outwith the
Cabinet. They will not have Mr Major's middle way between Europhile and
Europhobe. So Mr Blair hardly needs to keep up with the media to
scavenge on what looks increasingly like the Tory corpse.
Labour has learned the hard way over the past 20 years or so that
power evades those who cannot at least wrap themselves in the clothes of
unity of purpose and design. It is harder for the party of government to
do so, but it is inexcusable for it to throw the clothes away without
even trying them on for size.
It is said that Mr Major must give his Government and party firm
leadership, show them who is boss. On the contrary, if the voters are
not to run out of patience completely, it is up to his Government and
party to accord him firm leadership and demonstrate that he is the boss.

JUST think of it as the mental equivalent of a word-association test.
On seeing the word, you conjure up an appropriate image in your mind.
And the first word is . . . immigrant.
Now hands up all of you who had in mind a person of the Caucasian
persuasion. Embarrassingly few, I fear. Such has been the thrust of
immigration-control policy over a quarter of a century in the UK that
everybody knows but nobody admits that it has very little to do with
numbers of residents at all.
The fact is that every single legislative initiative from the major
Immigration Act of the early seventies to the visa restrictions of the
past few years has been aimed at controlling the numbers of black people
who settle here.
Primary immigration from places such as the Indian sub-continent
ceased long years ago. Even now families have inordinate problems trying
to bring in the closest of relations. Just visiting your family in
Britain is such a hassle that many Scots-Asian families no longer even
contemplate a visit by grandparents for fear of the treatment they might
encounter on arrival.
One statistic which should shame us all is that a Jamaican visitor has
a one-in-60 chance of being stopped and questioned about his or her
intentions by immigration control. In contrast an American has just a
one-in-1060 chance of being halted for the same purpose. Unless of
course the US citizen happens to be the wrong shade.
In truth none of the politicians given to fulminating about the
horrors of unfettered immigration would give the smallest damn if 10,000
more Australian au pairs popped up in the statistics, or, for that
matter, a few hundred more rich businessmen.
Just last year the Government announced that any wealthy foreigners
who fancied investing the odd bob in Britain should consider themselves
welcome and be assured that they wouldn't have to contend with any
nonsense about immigration controls. Instead they would be automatically
granted a year's residency. Compare and contrast, as they say, the
almost simultaneous refusal to give visas to people fleeing assorted
global atrocities.
And for those who do try to invoke the right of asylum, we have
another trick up our sleeves; detention in our prisons without trial and
without any of the normal rights governing the maximum period. We put
some 11,000 people in jail on this basis every year, some for a few days
before they're despatched elsewhere, some for months, some for years. At
any one time there are about 600 to 700 of such ''villains'' locked up
in the UK.
And just in case anyone fails to be deterred or misses the Go Home on
the mat, we also revoked the automatic right of the local MP to
intervene before removal or deportation, and we introduced legislation
which would make airlines liable to stiff fines if they carried anyone
without the appropriate visas. Ho yes, we're a pretty slovenly lot
guarding our borders.
An English High Court judge, Mr Justice Dyson, decided last month that
perhaps this kind of thing was not actually epitomising legal fair play.
So he ruled that illegal immigrants applying for asylum should not be
jailed under the Immigration Act. But enter, stage right, the Home
Secretary with a swift appeal which was, unsurprisingly, swiftly upheld.
In fairness to the Conservative Party, not all ministers have a
fixation about keeping Britain white. Some of them dislike foreigners of
any hue. Thus do we hear Mr Michael Portillo suggest that foreign
students cheat to get inferior degrees, while his soulmate Peter Lilley
alleges that London is full of people intent on a ''Crook's Tour'' of
our welfare-benefits system.
Curious, really, since Mr Portillo is the product of an Anglo/Spanish
partnership which might have made him rather prouder of his cosmopolitan
origins, and Mr Lilley has a home in France where he spends as much of
the year as his duties permit.
In fact, Mr Lilley is one of several thousands of enterprising Brits
who took advantage of relatively cheap property prices in agreeable
parts of M. Mitterrand's fiefdom. Go to some parts of the Dordogne or
Provencal in the summer and you'll be hard pressed to practise your
fractured French.
A similar linguistic difficulty is apparent in Tuscany, which fell to
the English some summers ago, while the Costa Brava seems to have merged
as one large retirement home for English gentlefolk.
Perhaps Brits travelling freely and settling elsewhere in the European
Community is subtly different in some fashion from the reverse. Though
you suspect, somehow, that a few thousand Frenchmen and women settling
in Kent might more than stretch any southern equivalent of the Entente
Cordiale.
For black Britons, however, this instinctive xenophobia is compounded
by the very obvious fact of their colour. Why we shouldn't celebrate
this diversity rather than be wary of it is one of life's larger and
more depressing mysteries. But it is a given of black life in Britain
that they will be more liable to racial harassment than any other group,
more likely to be questioned by the authorities, and less likely to gain
the employment of their choice, however well qualified.
Some people would try to excuse such indefensible prejudice by
suggesting that the Asian community, for instance, makes no effort to
integrate. And there is no doubt that many parents of Asian origin
attempt to hold on to family values they consider threatened by
contemporary British morality. But an equally potent factor is that if
you feel threatened as a group, you look to it for support and
protection.
Isn't it odd, too, that any expatriate Scot draped in tartan and
running a local Caledonian Society is preserving his cultural heritage,
while an expatriate Pakistani observing Asian festival days is
stubbornly refusing assimilation? Odder still that a skinhead football
''fan'' watching footage of his colleagues wreaking havoc in Dublin
should still be thirled to the illusion that a pale complexion denotes a
superior intelligence.

WE not only drank a toast to Robert Gordon at the weekend but wrapped
up a corner of my childhood which included a strange and haunting
episode. As the nostalgia flowed, the name of Betty Hadden kept flashing
before me, as reminder of a grisly murder which has lain unsolved for 50
years and for which I might have had a vital clue.
But I kept pushing her out of mind for this was the night of Robert
Gordon, the Aberdeen merchant who made his fortune in Danzig nearly 300
years ago and returned as the great benefactor of education in the
North-east.
He opened a haven for poor boys who, in the local dialect, took on the
name of Sillerton Loons, after an estate of the Gordon family.
That first building, still the proud focal point of Robert Gordon's
College in the heart of Aberdeen today, was soon commandeered by
Cumberland as a billet for his troops on the way to and from Culloden in
1746.
But once they had cleared the stench of the objectionable fellow the
school resumed its true purpose and became one of the great institutes
of education, now including Robert Gordon University.
The day-school remained the continuing link with the founder himself
and, in time, the demand from Aberdonians abroad to send their boys home
to be educated led to the opening of a boarding house in 1937.
Appropriately, it was called Sillerton House, an impressive
grey-granite building at Queen's Cross. So, two centuries after Robert
Gordon, there was a new race of Sillerton Loons, the sons of men who had
pursued tea in Assam, rubber in Malaya, jute in Calcutta.
Within that mixture of expatriates there was room for country loons
like myself, for whom the daily journey to Aberdeen was too far. And
that was how I became a Sillerton Loon in the middle of the Second World
War, exchanging the brose of the countryside for the greater
sophistication of the city.
The overlord of Sillerton was the imposing George E C Barton, who
opened the doors as housemaster in 1937 and proceeded to give the bulk
of his career to that task. I'm not sure they make men like George
Barton any more.
But with the changing needs of society, Sillerton House has outlived
its day and will close this summer, which explained our farewell toast
of Friday night.
Just as there were 13 boys in Robert Gordon's original venture, George
Barton too had begun with 13 Sillerton Loons in 1937. Fittingly, there
were 13 of us there -- his ''vintage boys'' as he called us -- to salute
him on Friday.
Now 85, he stood erect as ever and recalled the vision of the 1930s.
The memories flooded back and for me there was no escaping that late
autumn Saturday of 1945 when a friend and I accepted our pocket money
from Mr Barton and headed down Albyn Place for the Odeon Cinema.
At Holburn Junction we were beckoned by a sailor who asked if we would
deliver a letter to a certain house, wait to see if there was a reply
and bring it back to this doorway.
By skipping the pictures we could earn a couple of bob instead of
spending it. Yes, we would do it.
The street, in the Froghall district, turned out to be as much of a
slum as Aberdeen possessed. Gingerly we climbed the stair and knocked on
a door which opened to reveal a scene of post-war revelry. Sleaze might
be a better description.
As I revealed in my autobiography, drunken Servicemen lolled in chairs
with women on their knees, exposing legs and thighs and goodness knows
what. We were innocents at large.
A brittle woman took the note inside but returned to say there was no
reply. We duly reported at the appointed hour to the sailor, whose dark,
distinctive features I can see to this day.
It all seemed of no significance until a short time later when a man
strolling by the foreshore came across a sight which sent him scurrying
to the nearest phone-box. He had found a human arm, crudely sawn off,
with the fingers arched as if scratching at a killer.
There had been screams in the night but nobody paid any attention. The
arm belonged to 17-year-old Betty Hadden, whose mother Kate was a
well-known name in Aberdeen. Betty had been seen in the city's
Castlegate the night before. She had been seen with sailors . . . her
close friends lived in Froghall . . . and the police were looking for a
youth who had been known to carry a message to her.
Sailors were eventually traced to the ends of the earth and, trying to
recall the name on the envelope, my friend and I felt we might have been
able to help the police with a description.
But we were already in trouble academically and any brush with a
murder investigation would have been a short-cut to expulsion. We kept
our secret and I was many years into journalism before explaining it to
the head of the Aberdeen CID.
Whether or not we had a vital clue to the murderer of Betty Hadden we
shall never know. It was just an intriguing thought which was bound to
filter through the social haze of Friday night.

POLITICS is a serious business but its practitioners are at their
worst when their proper seriousness turns into dessicated duty. Sir
Nicholas Fairbairn was never a politician of the latter sort, indeed
dessication of any sort, be it of mind or body, was foreign to him. In
this he followed in a line of politicians of the greatest worth.
They are the men and women who will not necessarily toe a party line
or submit automatically to the more sterile directions of the Whips. Sir
Nicholas argued political points, by and large, because he believed in
them. If they corresponded with Tory Party policy, fine and well; if
they did not, then the Tory Party was wrong. With all the fine words
which will be spoken about him, it was this independence of mind and the
willingness to act on it which was his greatest attribute. It is a great
pity that this quality is not more evident among the whipped legions who
inhabit all sides of the House of Commons today.
It is true, of course, that independence of mind is not of any help in
the cause of advancement. Sir Nicholas was solicitor-general for three
years but he was never likely to progress further from that position;
indeed his experiences in office suggest strongly that he should have
avoided both promotion and politics. It is easy to forget that over and
above the welter of colourful stories, disgraces, and eccentric
behaviour, Sir Nicholas was a lawyer and advocate of considerable
distinction. To describe him as an ornament of Scots law is to use,
unrepentantly, an archaic cliche, but somehow it suits perfectly both
his talents and his person.
For all of these reasons it is perfectly proper to discuss, even so
soon after the prospects of the Tory Party in his constituency. Indeed,
Sir Nicholas would have been contemptuous of any false sensitivities
which would have precluded the debate. His own views on the chosen Tory
candidate for Perth and Kinross were revealed in this newspaper
recently. Without rehearsing them in detail again, suffice to say that
Sir Nicholas clearly believed that Mr John Godfrey would have little
chance of holding the seat. He was probably correct. The seat is highly
marginal and the Scottish Nationalists were beaten by little more than
2000 votes in the 1992 General Election. A wave of sympathy votes for Mr
Godfrey is unlikely, given his predecessor's attitude towards him. The
best he can do is make what he can of a bad job. The best the voters of
Perth and Kinross can do is to eschew party loyalty and vote exactly the
way they feel. That would be unusual, but it would earn a raucous laugh
from beyond the grave.

THE peace process in Northern Ireland is reaching a crucial point with
the completion of the framework document expected imminently. There is
an expectation that this could also mean publication of the document
some time within the coming week, although there are reasons why this
timetable should be rejected. The first lies in the fact that Sir
Patrick Mayhew and Mr Dick Spring negotiated for four hours at the
weekend, and still failed to bring matters to a conclusion.
This is most certainly not a crisis and not even a cause for concern.
It is a matter of exact wording rather than agreement on broader issues
which is wanting, although it is important to remember that the
achievement of agreement on wording down to the last vowel and consonant
is vitally important. The Downing Street Declaration was subjected to
exactly the same process and went through eight final versions before a
precise wording was agreed. If more time is needed to prepare the
document for presentation to the Irish and British governments, that
time should be taken.  The second reason for delaying publication, if
not necessarily presentation to government, beyond this week is simpler
but just as important. Sinn Fein's annual conference takes place in
Dublin over the coming weekend. It would be folly to publish any details
of the framework agreement before this meeting has ended. The clear
danger is that detailed discussion of the document among delegates to
the Sinn Fein conference would give ammunition to those on all sides of
the argument who might wish the peace process to fail.
Happily, the Ulster Unionists appear to have agreed to wait until the
document is made known to them in detail before condemning it. As they
are not yet familiar with its contents it is puzzling to read of Mr
David Trimble's insistence that it is prescriptive rather than
consultative. This is contrary to the Prime Minister's promise of full
consultation and that nothing will be forced on the people of Northern
Ireland against their will. This is a dangerous but hopeful time. Cool
heads should, and must, prevail.

AS a cyclist, pedestrian, and resident of Glasgow, but mainly in my
capacity as secretary of the Glasgow Cycling Campaign, I am writing to
express enormous concern over the cloud of uncertainty affecting the
future of the Bell's Bridge.
The bridge has become wedged in an intractable wrangle between the
Glasgow Development Agency and the Scottish Exhibition and Conference
Centre.
Based on correspondence received by the Glasgow cycling campaign, the
GDA wants to retain the Bell's Bridge on its existing site whereas the
SECC would happily see it relocated.
In their skirmishing both organisations seem in danger of forgetting
the interests of the people who actually use Bell's Bridge -- cyclists
and pedestrians, many of whom will subsidise both organisations through
their taxes.
The bridge is a precious and safe care-free crossing of the river in a
city that has the lowest provision of cycling infrastructure for any
comparable city in Europe.
It is a vital link in a tiny cycle network. To lose it at the altar of
commercial development would be an act of vandalism.
The bridge has been out of commission for a couple of months. We would
like to think this unique crossing point on the Clyde can be returned to
full use before spring.

RUTH WISHART and other defenders of the permissive society give the
impression that the idea that sexual intercourse outside marriage is
wrong has been thought up by a set of narrow-minded, interfering,
religious bigots (February 13).
In fact, it is the plain teaching of Jesus Christ.
He was never afraid to rebuke people for what they did behind closed
doors, condemning not only what went on in their bedrooms, or any other
rooms, but also in their hearts: ''Out of the heart come evil thoughts,
murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.
These are what make a person unclean'' (Matthew 15:19).
Of course he spoke of sins other than sexual ones as this list and his
other teaching show.
But, since marriage and the home are at the foundation of human
society, he also made a particular point of reproving the behaviour and
attitudes which threaten and destabilise them (Matthew 19:4-6; 5:27-30).
So, when Ruth Wishart says, ''Get the hell out'', she isn't only
addressing the Kirk's Board of Social Responsibility but the One whose
complete social teaching they have a responsibility to communicate.

THE decision of Edinburgh University to award an honorary degree to
the Scottish philosopher Dr George Davie will be welcomed by all those
with a knowledge of his work.
I wonder, though, why the description ''pioneer in the study of the
Scottish Enlightenment'' is apparently being used by the university as
sole justification of its gesture.
Although Dr Davie has indeed written some innovative essays on the
eighteenth-century Enlightenment period in Scotland, his main
achievement is generally recognised to be his studies of the system of
liberal education in Scotland of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
and of the many undervalued Scottish philosophers and literary figures
of this latter period.
Edinburgh University Press some time ago produced a Festschrist volume
dedicated to Dr Davie in which every contribution was addressed solely
to the eighteenth century despite the fact that Dr Davie, in his then
published work, had stated it as a principal aim of his work to
stimulate interest in more recent Scottish thinkers.
I hope that Edinburgh University's recent recognition of Dr Davie's
work on Enlightenment Scotland does not unwittingly give the impression
that this work is of interest only to historians of eighteenth-century
Scotland.
It is, rather, of importance to anyone in Scotland and beyond
concerned to limit modern intrusions of consumerist culture into areas
of our social, political, educational, and religious life in which it
has little or nothing to offer.

I AM responding to the ''lacklustre'' critique by Sara Villiers of
Lara Jane Bunting's play, My Piece of Foreign Sky, at the Cottier. I
travelled from Dundee to see this performance by the exciting new group
Irresistible Flood and was not disappointed.
What was she thinking of when she wrote it? Was she thinking at all?
This play was not about ''pit closures in Ayrshire'' -- certainly they
were mentioned, but the real theme of the play was easy enough to see.
This was a play not about ''a crisis exposing cracks in a . . . family
unit'', but about family dynamics, about the inevitable but covert
incest in the mother-son relationship, and about the longest and most
difficult journey a boy ever has to make -- that from his mother's side
to his wife's/life partner's: the journey from boyhood to manhood.
It's about a mother's hopes and dreams for a boy who, having grown to
manhood, no longer exists. This play would have happened whether or not
the pits closed -- that was merely going on while the real action took
place. And the real action takes place in every family, every day,
everywhere. The universality of this subject is what makes it neither
fashionable nor unfashionable, simply true.

THE recent press reports about ScotRail sending two damaged 314 sets
to Derby and Crewe workshops by road for repair is yet another example
of what we can expect in the break up of the railway system.
The ludicrous decision to send railway coaches by road is bad enough,
but what was really reprehensible was the decision to award the repair
contract to ABB's workshop in England nearly 300 miles away when
literally just up the road Glasgow's own Springburn depot is quite
clearly capable of carrying out the work required. Springburn did tender
for the work, along with ABB and one other company, but lost for reasons
known only to ScotRail.
This brings me to the role or lack of it played by Strathclyde
Regional Council. In October 107 redundancies were announced at
Springburn. Every redundant worker at Springburn is a Strathclyde
Regional Council taxpayer and the region, which subsidises ScotRail by
millions of pounds, did not take steps to ensure the work stayed in
Scotland.
The workforce at Springburn neither ask nor expect preferential
treatment, but when Scottish region work is sent to workshops in England
we feel that we are getting a raw deal not only from ScotRail but also
the regional council.

ANNE JOHNSTONE'S article, New rules on sick pay causing pain for
employees, February 9, provides unwelcome confirmation of the warnings
issued a year ago by the Federation of Small Businesses.
When the most recent changes to the statutory sick-pay legislation
were first proposed almost 14 months ago, the federation repeatedly
warned of the consequences of placing additional monetary burdens (#40
for every worker) on hard-pressed employers.
Our belief then, which has now been confirmed, was that the extra cost
of sick pay would result in a crackdown on sick leave and a
discrimination in recruiting staff who are prone to illness and absence.
Unfortunately our warnings were ignored. While the over-zealous
attitudes quoted in the article are not yet common practice within the
small businesses sector, the traditionally good relationship between
small businesses and their employees has suffered.
Overall the absenteeism/sickness of employees in small businesses has
a much greater impact upon the smaller business than it has on the
larger firm.
Consequently the small business employer/ employee relationship has
traditionally been closer and more flexible in its working practices.
This is now under threat due in our opinion to the new sick-pay rules.
These changes have forced the majority of employers to make unwanted
changes, based primarily on cost considerations, to tighten up their
sick-pay procedures.
The FSB has become increasingly concerned at the recent measures by
the Government to transfer the burden of the welfare state on to the
employer and this is but another example.
Making employers fully responsible for the cost of statutory sick pay
and also a proportion of maternity pay will act as a disincentive to
employment; it encourages discrimination against those likely to be ill
or to take maternity leave and undermines business stability.
This unwelcome develop in employer/employee relationships may just
prove to be only the tip of the iceberg if employers are forced to pay
what has always been society's debt.

MR HURD, in seeking to answer questions put to him by Mr Tam Dalyell,
MP, in the House, seemed to be walking a tightrope (February 1).
There was, he said, ''no credible evidence -- the assessment of the
prosecuting authorities -- to substantiate either theory'' (of
Palestinian terrorist or Iranian involvement in the Lockerbie atrocity).
A tightrope is absolutely dependent upon the integrity of the anchors
at each end. It seems one of Mr Hurd's anchors is founded in German
intelligence and the other in the CIA.
Recent revelations have shown the Germans negotiating with Iran over
the release of the last of the Syrian-backed terrorists (Dalkamoni) whom
they had arrested two months before Lockerbie when actually in
possession of a specifically anti-aircraft bomb, and have reminded us
all that the bulk of that group (including their bomb-maker, Kreesat)
had been set free at the behest of German intelligence in good time to
have taken part in the bombing.
Those responsible for the criminal investigation should therefore be
circumspect in accepting German intelligence support where such an
obvious motive for deflecting attention from the Frankfurt area exists.
As for the other anchor, the CIA, that was handled by Mr Vincent
Cannistrarro, who has now retired as head of CIA counter-terrorism
operations and from the CIA input to the Lockerbie investigation.
More significantly he has now told the restricted-circulation Israeli
news-sheet, BIPAC, that he believes that Ahmed Jibril, the leader of the
PFLP-GC group whose second-in-command was the same Dalkamoni, arrested
near Frankfurt, did indeed have a contract from the Iranians for the
destruction of US aircraft at the time, in retaliation for the US
shoot-down of their airbus.
In the same interview Mr Cannistrarro details how the Damascus 10
group of terrorist organisations -- among them the same PFLP-GC -- are
Syrian sponsored to the point where ''nothing happens without the
knowledge of Syrian intelligence''.
It is interesting how Mr Hurd avoids linking the word Syrian to these
groups, referring to the PFLP-GC as Palestinian, and how he refers to
the US intelligence document linking Iran to the bombing as a dud, in
contrast to Mr Cannistrarro, whose words now echo it.
As Mr Hurd walks his tightrope he maintains that he knows no evidence
for the involvement of any country other than Libya. That cannot
possibly be true of members of the intelligence services of Britain,
Germany, or the US.
Are we soon to see the classic cartoon situation where the hero has
had the support cut from under him, but hasn't yet realised it, and one
is shown a zoom-in close up of his expression as the truth dawns before
the inevitable force of gravity suddenly whisks him out of sight?
If so, Mr Hurd should find he lands safely with Scotland's Lord
Advocate and Mr Major for company.

SOME actors take their craft so seriously that they react as if they
were always on stage. When Sir Laurence Olivier, visiting Jamaica, was
taken by Noel Coward to see a favourite mountain view, he looked down at
the terraces of jungle trees and said: ''How dreadful. It looks like
rows of empty seats.'' Lack of an audience is one of an actor's worst
nightmares. During the Paris cholera outbreak in 1832, for instance, the
cast at the Odeon was so annoyed at being forced to perform before an
audience of one that they acted as badly as they could, and threw out
the solitary spectator when he hissed them. Even this is not the most
dreaded audience reaction, however. At the Gielgud Theatre in London
recently, when Donald Sinden came on stage for Act Two of Hamlet, he saw
a schoolgirl slumbering in the front row of the stalls. ''She's gone to
sleep,'' he announced from the edge of the stage. ''Sit up! Sit up!''
Sinden declaimed, at which the girl woke up and enjoyed the rest of his
Polonius. It will doubtless add to the rich store of anecdotes about the
play. Polonius may not be the most prestigious of parts, but he allows
of enough interpretations to give actors scope . . . the sly and
sententious old courtier still capable of giving his son irreproachable
advice: ''This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow,
as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man.''
By tradition, Shakespeare himself was only good enough to play the
Ghost. Yet even such minor roles are crucial, as a touring company
discovered when Hamlet utters the words: ''Perchance 'twill walk
again.'' A back-stage voice responded loudly: ''Nay, 'twill walk no more
until its salary is paid.''

THE article on poverty should set alarm bells ringing in the minds of

(February 11).
Professor Bruce articulated and focused my mind on a dangerously
deteriorating situation concerning the social divisions in our society
today.
His studied and detailed projection of our future is one which should
worry politicians and parents alike.
In contrast Howard Davies sees this process as inevitable and quite
unremarkable, undoubtedly from a position inside the barricades --
alarms, security doors, closed circuit TV et al.
The notion that wealth and property will always prevail against
poverty and deprivation is a myth that has exploded into tragedy since
civilisation began.
Unless we turn away from the gods of greed and corruption, the
disasters that overtook people on a national scale will in a shrinking
world become a global disaster.

AS one privileged to see the humpbacked whale currently visiting the
Clyde (February 14), I was horrifed to read the letter from Mr Liddell
proposing that this gentle creature be caught and made into steaks.
Had Mr Liddell experienced the atmosphere of excitement and wonder
that overcame the crowd of watchers when the whale was sighted, he would
most certainly have been incapable of suggesting this ridiculous and
antiquated course of action.  It is the selfish and short-sighted
attitude of people like Mr Liddell that will deprive future generations
of the opportunity to experience an encounter with this awe-inspiring
creature.

Since her surprise appointment as head of drama, Andrea Calderwood has
confounded her critics by securing more network commissions for BBC
Scotland than ever before
We don't want to be marginal and seen as a supplier of a particularly
Scottish thing
WHEN Andrea Calderwood was appointed head of drama at BBC Scotland
just over a year ago, she was warned by her broadcasting chums to beware
the intricate politics of the corporation. Battles with London, they
said, would be fierce and there would be blood all over the walls.
It is slightly disconcerting, therefore, to discover that the first
thing the lady does when you enter her office is to apologise for the
state of the walls. Your eyes immediately dart towards them, searching
for the telltale bloodstains. There are none. The walls -- and here is
where the apology comes in -- were badly marked by smoke and water
during a recent fire which damaged the rear section of the Beeb's Queen
Margaret Drive headquarters. They have still to be re-painted.
If fast-talking is the route to success in the BBC then 29-year-old Ms
Calderwood will be Director-General before she turns 30. She speaks like
a machine gun, rattling out her commonsense thoughts and refreshingly
direct opinions at a speed which is a challenge to a reporter's rusty
shorthand. When you ask her to slow down, she does. Briefly. And then
she forgets and hits you again with her 100mph flow of words. Maybe, you
think, it's time to invest in a dictaphone.
When Andrea Calderwood applied for Bill Bryden's job (surely the top
post in Scottish television drama) she reckoned she had two chances --
slim and none. But, as an independent producer working in Glasgow, she
felt frustrated. It seemed to her that, like the devil, the BBC in
London had all the best tunes and she reckoned that BBC Scotland should
be pushing the boundaries with its creative talent base. So she went
along, not with any great hope of getting the job, but more to take the
opportunity to say her piece. As it happened, Head of Television Colin
Cameron decided to call her bluff.
All of a sudden the poacher turned gamekeeper. And it didn't go down
terribly well with some of the big fish. Her surprise appointment (and
there is no escaping the fact that it was a surprise) was a signal to
unleash the dogs of war. Well, not so much the dogs, more just a
solitary, ill-tempered, rottweiller. Playwright Peter McDougall, ever
the diplomat, described it as a ''mind-boggling joke.'' He couldn't
believe that his old mate Bryden's replacement was ''a lassie.''
But she was and, by the strict terms of The Act, she still is. A
lassie -- as in woman; female; lady; opposite sex from McDougall.
Drastic surgery aside, it is difficult to see how she could be
otherwise.
For a mind-boggling joke, Andrea Calderwood is being taken rather
seriously these days by those above and below her in the BBC. She has
confounded her critics by securing more network commissions for BBC
Scotland than ever before. In the space of a year she has sold
#13m-worth of drama to London. And there is more to come.
But still there are those who are not happy. Curiously, the name
McDougall crops up again. A couple of weeks ago, miffed that his
adaptation of Jeff Torrington's award-winning novel Swing Hammer Swing
failed to get the go-ahead, he accused BBC Scotland of being ''utterly
answerable to London.''
This is something to which Calderwood freely admits. It is simply the
way of things in the BBC that network commissions are, well,
commissioned by the network. It is the Controllers of BBC1 and BBC2 who
hold the purse strings for non-regional programmes. It's always been
that way and, save a sudden bout of Scottish independence, it will
remain so.
BBC Scotland, according to Calderwood, has no God-given right to make
drama for the network. It gets there on its merit. And meritorious
programmes are what she is all about.
''I feel that we should not just be doing the occasional play or
series for the network. We should be consistently part of the BBC's core
output. We don't want to be marginal and seen as a supplier of a
particularly Scottish thing.
''My target when I took this job was to get about 20 hours of network
drama a year coming from Scotland. It has exceeded my expectation. We're
more than halfway towards reaching that target which I had set for three
years' time,'' she explains.
This year in network terms, BBC Scotland has the second series of the
hospital comedy Cardiac Arrest, a new four-part romantic comedy serial,
A Mug's Game, and a highly promising detective series, Hamish MacBeth.
In addition, it has also been given the go-ahead to make a feature film
(Easterhouse directed by Gillies McKinnon) for the Screen One strand.
The first of these to hit the screens will be the slightly offbeat
Hamish MacBeth, starring Robert Carlyle, which is scheduled to go out,
probably in April, in the important early Sunday evening slot (Pie in
the Sky/Lovejoy time). A great deal is riding on the programme's success
or failure. An audience of anything between six million and 10 million
will virtually guarantee a second series.
''We're very optimistic about it but it's only one of a range of
programmes. We don't pin all our hopes on one drama. I think it will
work well with the audience because, though it is mainstream, it is also
highly original.
''Everybody knows who you mean when you mention Bobby Carlyle -- he
was in Riff Raff, he was the knife killer in Cracker; he was the
detective who was murdered in the first episode of 99:1 -- but it is
great to give him this kind of star profile.
''People who haven't seen it say 'Well, it must be like Heartbeat' or
'It's just another Taggart.' But it's not. As soon as you see it you
realise that it is a very different and original piece of work,'' she
explains.
The series was commissioned by BBC Scotland but it is the joint
product of two independent companies (Zenith and Skyline). Cardiac
Arrest is also an independent production. So, with two out of the three
BBC drama serials coming from Scotland this year being independent, does
this not suggest that Queen Margaret Drive is neglecting its in-house
talent?
''We have a strong slate of drama productions and, working with
independents, means that we can use a greater range of Scottish talent.
Over the past three years, London's serials and series have been between
half and two-thirds independent. It needs to be a blend of both.
''We will have Scottish drama in every area of the BBC network, some
in-house and some independent. One of my first moves when I arrived was
to have editorial control of (the independent) Cardiac Arrest shifted
from London to Glasgow. I felt it was a serial created by a Scottish
production team and I felt it should be recognised as such.
''This has allowed us to have much closer links with one of Britain's
leading production companies -- Island World -- and help to build our
reputation as a high-quality volume supplier of network drama,'' she
explains.
BBC Scotland has to recognise the ''realistic capacity'' which it
could handle. Independents (and there is an onus on the Beeb to use
them) help to increase that capacity, she says.
Calderwood admits that, despite all that had been achieved,  there is
still a bias in the BBC against the regions.
''The problem is that, traditionally, the regions have not supplied a
significant amount of drama to the network. They don't expect us to
provide them with three series and we have had to convince them that we
can. We have doubled our output, doubled our range, but we have to be
very strategic about it and not allow ourselves to stand or fall on one
programme.
''If I had to fight any battle with London this year it was to make it
clear to the controllers that Scotland can produce drama of quality and
volume which can be part of the core network output,'' she adds.
And so the conversation comes round to Swing Hammer Swing which,
Calderwood concedes, was a prestigious piece of work and that there was
certainly a case for it to be made. What is not generally recognised is
the fact that she fought tooth and nail with London to have it produced.
''The problem was that it was an adaptation of an award-winning novel
but the movement within single drama has been very much towards original
work rather than adaptations. It was also set in the sixties and they
want modern contemporary drama.
''It was a very difficult book to adapt. It's is a monologue and it's
slightly surreal. Peter did a very effective job but, for the network,
funding is in the hands of the Controllers of BBC1 and BBC2. They make
the decisions. And, because there was this general shift towards
contemporary drama, there were a lot of things planned under the
previous regime which no longer fitted. Peter was understandably
frustrated,'' she explains.

DICK Hyman is a chameleon of the keyboards. A man whose pianistic
expertise spans everything from ragtime to bebop, and beyond. Jazzwise,
few can better his credentials.
During his student days, Hyman won 12 lessons with legendary pianist
Teddy Wilson; and went on to play with everyone from Charlie Parker to
Ruby Braff. As a composer, his work has been recorded by as unlikely a
performer as the singer k d lang who recorded an evocative Hyman piece
called Shadowland as the title track for her 1988 album. His most recent
composition -- a concerto called Tune and Transformation: Variations on
a Theme -- was commissioned for performance by an orchestra featuring a
soloist who plays five instruments.
Over the past 15 years, Hyman has added a new string to his bow. An
authority on the music of the 1920s and 1930s, he has found himself
''cast as a film writer for period or older styles''. And despite
providing an Italianate soundtrack for the Cher movie Moonstruck, and
playing all the piano parts for the biopic of ragtime composer Scott
Joplin, Hyman's most famous role continues to be as musical director on
various Woody Allen films.
The association with Allen, whose latest work Bullets over Broadway
last week received seven Oscar nominations, goes back as far as 1971
when Hyman played in the band on the soundtrack of Everything You Ever
Wanted to Know About Sex. He was also heard in the 1979 Manhattan, and
Stardust Memories the following year. But it was with the superb
pseudo-documentary Zelig that Hyman assumed a semi-regular role on
Allen's exclusive team.
This 1983 film was the story of another (this time fictitious)
chameleon character called Leonard Zelig, who transmogrifies to resemble
whatever company he finds himself in. As Hyman will testify, Allen works
in mysterious ways his cinematic wonders to perform. ''Woody is very
secretive. In espionage, they use the phrase 'For your eyes only' for
secret documents, and generally I have the impression that this is how
he works with every specialist.''
Hyman has just finished working on Bullets Over Broadway and, despite
the fact that he was on set for two days of filming, he knows very
little about the latest Woody-work.
''I know it's set in 1928, and I gather from the dialogue that it's a
gangster movie. They constructed an elaborate speakeasy set, and I was
in some scenes, conducting a fairly big jazz orchestra to play behind a
chorus line.''
A man with his agile fingers in many musical pies, Hyman was en route
to a festival in Oregon when I met him. His programme there was to
include giving a series of lectures (Honky Tonk Professor strides
again!); premiering the afore-mentioned concerto; accompanying a Laurel
and Hardy silent, and -- switching to organ -- participating in the
recreation of an old-fashioned soap opera. Eat your heart out, Leonard
Zelig.

HELEN LENNOX
examines the case for a keener debate
when youth is mixed with experience
THE impact of a changing employment culture will affect the lives of
everyone working in Scotland today and in the future, and will be the
key decider in the country's competitiveness in the street market of the
world.
Russel Griggs of Scottish Enterprise believes the subject is so
important to the future of Scotland's economy and its ability to compete
in constantly-changing global markets that it must be debated on as wide
a platform as possible.
It is sponsoring 20 places at the influential Scottish Council Forum
organised by the Scottish Council Development and Industry later this
week, ensuring that youth is coupled with experience to provide one of
the most stimulating and thought-provoking debates ever held in the
Forum's 25-year history.
Key members of the Scottish Council have nominated a ''manager of
tomorrow'' -- the key requirement is to be under 40 years -- to attend
the Gleneagles gathering for three days of lively debate (Wednesday to
Friday).
The Forum is recognised as the only meeting-of-minds in Scotland which
brings together leading men and women from all sections of public life
to consider issues of importance to the country's long-term economic
well-being.
Now, for the first time, a new generation of businessmen and women
will take part in the debate with the backing of Scottish Enterprise.
Griggs, who is director of business development with Scottish
Enterprise, says: ''We realise the importance of the Scottish Council
Forum as a platform for forming key opinions within the business
community in Scotland.
''This year the subject Changing Patterns of Employment opens up a
wide range of scope for discussion. We want to ensure that debates such
as these involve today's managers and the rising stars across every
sector of business who will be tomorrow's managers.
''When we first put the suggestion to the companies to nominate a
person from within their organisations the response was very good. They
all realise the wealth of talent they have. There is a good
cross-section of people from the manufacturing, financial and service
sectors. They will help make this a lively debate.''
Dr Ian Preston, chairman of the Scottish Council, adds: ''This Forum
is shaping up to be a stimulating and challenging debate on important
issues affecting the Scottish economy.
''We want a debate that comes up with fresh ideas. We are confident
that it will produce a range of new ideas which will stimulate new and
innovative approaches.''
Alan Murphy, managing director of Motherwell Bridge in Lanarkshire,
nominated 35-year-old Ian Lindsay, storage tank construction manager for
the Forum under the Scottish Enterprise sponsorship.
Mr Murphy says: ''Ian is one of our brightest managers and typical of
the management of the future. There is always a very interesting debate
at the Forum but in the past it has been dominated by the same old
faces, year in year out. There has not been enough of a mix of young and
old.
''It will be beneficial for the Forum to have young blood. These young
managers can also learn from us. They can listen to our ideas and debate
and decide whether we are still living in the past or dragging ourselves
into the twenty-first century.''
Neil McIntosh, chief executive of Strathclyde Regional Council, who
nominated 39-year-old James McCaffer, an executive officer with
Strathclyde, says: ''Jim has been involved in economic strategic issues
for the Region and, as well as gaining from the Forum, he will also be
able to contribute to the debate.
''Strathclyde is big business and it is good for one of our managers
to mix with managers from the private sector and commerce. It is
essential that tomorrow's key influencers be involved in discussions
early in the day rather than later.''
Eric Sanderson, chief executive of British Linen Bank Group Ltd, who
nominated 37-year-old John Watt, assistant director of Corporate
Finance, says: ''The Forum always attracts the most senior people in
companies. This sponsorship scheme will allow younger managers exposure
to senior people from all sectors. Hopefully we can learn from each
other.''
Highlands and Islands Enterprise is supporting seven younger
participants, and the Scottish Council Development and Industry itself
is supporting seven ''young'' managers during the Forum.
Key speakers include Dr Ann Robinson, head of Policy Unit, Institute
of Directors; Rosemary McKenna, President of COSLA; Sir Alistair Grant,
chairman of Argyll Group; and Mr John Ward, chairman CBI Scotland.

CRAIG Charles, star of BBC's Red Dwarf series, will appear in court at
Southwark Crown Court today, charged with rape.
Mr Charles, 30, of Tyers Street, Kennington, south London, was granted
bail in October on condition that he stayed with relatives in Liverpool.
He is jointly charged with company director John Peploe, 36, of
Keswick House, Crawford Road, Camberwell, south London.
Mr Charles was arrested in July last year, accused of the rape of a
38-year-old woman at a flat in Clapham, south London.
During the three months he was in custody, the actor claims to have
been the victim of several assaults.
The Mersey-born comedian was working on the sixth series of Red Dwarf,
in which he plays super slob Dave Lister, the curry-loving last human in
the universe.
The series attracted an audience of seven million and became a cult
show in the United States.
A former pupil at West Derby comprehensive school, Liverpool, Mr
Charles was influenced by the poetry of Roger McGough and Adrian Henri,
and he began writing his own poems.
He had his first taste of showbusiness by gatecrashing a pop concert
by Teardrop Explodes in 1982, invading the stage and grabbing the
microphone to deliver some of his poems.
At the age of 21, he sent a video of himself performing his poems to
Channel 4's black arts programme Black on Black, which led to
appearances on Ned Sherrin's Radio 4 programme Loose Ends. He also
became a regular on the Terry Wogan Show.
His acting debut was in Business As Usual with Liverpool barrister's
daughter Cathy Tyson, whom he had married at 19. The couple had a son,
now aged seven, but the marriage broke up in 1989.
He was one of the original presenters of the LWT show Night Network
and he also starred as a mass murderer in the BBC drama series, The
Marksman.

Scottish Council
chief executive
Hamish Morrison
suggests a rethink
THE 25th Scottish Council Forum sets a number of challenges. The theme
of the conference -- Changing Employment Patterns -- sounds like an
observation but can also be read as a challenge.
Indeed, a more challenging atmosphere in the Forum's debate is a
likely consequence of the younger participants' scheme being introduced
this year.
Perhaps the greatest challenge of all is the implicit commitment to
generate radical new ideas on a very old problem. Fortunately, the
Scottish Council has members, friends and allies in all parts of the
industrial community and their willingness to share the burden makes
even the most daunting challenge tenable.
Employment policy is, by its nature, highly politicised. Yet the
partisan expressions of outrage or celebration which greet the monthly
unemployment figures hardly amount to a policy debate. In any case, the
figures are misleading. They count only those claiming unemployment
benefit. They exclude those on other benefits, in training, continuing
education, and a significant number who do not claim benefit but are,
nonethless, seeking work.
The quarterly employment survey gives a better indication of
employment patterns but, being a sample survey (around 1500 households
in Scotland), it carries the usual risk of sampling error. These
figures, too, conceal a number of job-seekers who, though employed, are
looking for better pay and more security.
Since the end of the Second World War the main response to scarce
employment opportunities has been the attraction of large-scale inward
investment by international manufacturers. In its heyday, this policy
could bring thousands of jobs in a single project. It still happens
occasionally but the numbers are less impressive nowadays.
Rapidly-advancing technology in manufacturing improves quality and
output but requires fewer workers. It is even possible to wonder if
manufacturing is entering the same kind of cycle which agriculture has
experienced over the past 50 years with output up tenfold and employment
reduced to a tenth.
It has been clear for several years that job growth is more likely in
the service industries than in manufacturing. Yet the mere suggestion
that Scotland should develop its service sector is enough to make
otherwise sensible folk foam at the mouth and rant about turning the
country into a theme park.
The knee-jerk reaction is that service industries provide only
low-grade, poorly-paid jobs. If this is true, it is a reflection on the
poorly developed state of Scotland's service economy rather than some
intrinsic fault in the service industries themselves.
What is the fundamental economic difference between selling a computer
to Europe and selling an engineering design to the USA or, for that
matter, renting a hotel room to a Japanese visitor in the Highlands?
There is a rapidly-growing international trade in services. On some
estimates the value of globally-traded services will exceed the value of
traded goods by 2010. As matters stand, Scotland has 10% of the UK's
manufactured exports and 2% of its traded services.
Just like manufacturing, an efficient service economy requires the
right infrastructure. In global service industries, modern information
technology and advanced telecommunications systems are more important
than roads and seaports. Maybe we have to rethink our investment
priorities and financing methods in a rather fundamental way.
Traded services and, indeed, advanced forms of manufacture, also
require an efficient ''intellectual infrastructure'' to enable the
development of ideas and concepts into tradeable products.
The education system is at the core of this evolving structure.
Perhaps industry-academic collaboration will eventually become
full-blown integration. Just as the New Towns became the ideal location
for labour intensive manufacturing, the new universities might become
the natural hosts for new businesses trading in intellectual property.
Indeed, growing internationalisation and commercialisation of
universities and colleges may be early evidence of such a trend.
Market forces are changing our manufacturing-driven labour market to
one more oriented towards services. However, the free market mechanism,
left to its own devices, can exact a heavy price on public morale,
consumer confidence and social stability.
Government cannot stand aside from this process. Policies must be
developed which seek to manage these changes to the benefit of Scotland
and its people. The 25th Scottish Council Forum has an important role in
promoting the debate which can help to create that benign policy
environment.

M77 protesters said last night that they feared Wimpey, the
construction company in charge of building the extension link, this week
would try to clear them out of their camp, the so-called Pollok Free
State.
A spokesman said last night: ''We expect the company to take some sort
of action against us very soon. We've pulled everyone back into the camp
and will be trying to make sure they don't destroy our trees. They
managed to smash hundreds of trees last week.''
Protesters undertook climbing workshops yesterday to help them scamper
into the trees the moment the first earth-mover is spotted.
Another four cars were added to Carhenge, a display of wrecked cars
embedded in the motorway's preparatory earthworks, at the weekend.
The cars, donated by English radicals who drove them to Pollok from
Brighton and Oxford last week, were set in concrete before being soaked
in petrol and set alight.
Wimpey could not be contacted for comment last night but it is
understood tree clearing work at other sites along the route is nearing
completion.

<HEADLINE>Mother returns at midnight to find scene of 'total carnage'. Boy and babysitter murdered</HEADLINE>

A BOY of seven and his teenage babysitter have been stabbed to death
in a ''frenzied'' attack in a bedroom, police said yesterday.
Jonathan Copley and 15-year-old Rachel Rooney were discovered with
knife wounds in a scene described by police as ''total carnage''.
Jonathan's mother, Mrs Denise Copley, and his two elder sisters found
the bodies when they returned to the family's terraced home in Little
Horton, Bradford, from a party just after midnight.
Rachel, a friend of Jonathan's 15-year-old sister Elizabeth, had
travelled from her home in nearby Queensbury to the Copley's house to
babysit Jonathan on Saturday night.
Detective Superintendent Malcolm Mawson, leading the hunt for the
double murderer, said it was a ''frenzied and constant attack''.
He said: ''We believe the weapon used was a knife, perhaps with a
blade about 6in long and half-an-inch wide.'' He added that the weapon
had not been recovered. Investigations were continuing to establish a
motive, which was not clear.
''There is no indication at the moment that any sexual assault took
place and it is too early to say whether anything has been stolen,'' he
added.
A neighbour of the Copley family, 22-year-old Taranjit Shergill, said
she had been watching television around midnight when she heard a knock
on the door, and then a car drive away minutes later.
''I thought nothing of it at the time but, about half-an-hour later, I
heard hysterical screaming in the street,'' she said. ''I looked out of
the window and there was this girl shouting 'Jonathan, Jonathan' and she
collapsed in the road.''
Mrs Copley and her husband, Robert, a joiner, separated less than a
year ago and the divorce had been granted last month.
Mrs Copley had started seeing a man called Brian and they seemed
''perfectly happy'' together.
However, Mr Copley returned to the family home for Christmas because
Jonathan wanted his father with him when he opened his presents.
He had stayed for a couple of days but left once festivities were
over, according to nearby residents.
Trainee accountant Sabina Chadun, 23, formerly of the same street but
now living in nearby Wyke, said she was devastated when she heard that
Jonathan had been killed.
''I looked after him on a couple of occasions and he was such a cute
lad, very lively, talkative, and cheeky. He was lovely,'' she said.
''I was stunned when I heard the news. I just sat down and cried.''
She described the boy as ''chocolate mad''. He was a pupil at South
Mear Primary School, near his home.
Rachel Rooney, the murdered babysitter, is believed to have attended
Queensbury Upper School in her home town, and neighbours were devastated
by the death of the ''lovely looking girl''.
As a blue saloon car was taken away by forensic experts for routine
tests, a resident living near the Rooneys' home spoke of their shock.
A Home Office pathologist and forensic scientists have been at the
Copley house to carry out investigations and post-mortem examinations
were are also being held.
Police particularly want to speak to a young man seen on a moped-type
vehicle outside the house between 10.30pm and 10.45pm on Saturday.

LAURIE HUNTER
looks at how the 'flexible' market has
favoured the part-time woman worker
IN the last three years or so we have been first looking for
indications that the labour market was reaching the bottom of the
recession, then for signs of recovery; and now we are anxiously debating
whether the economy is growing too fast.
It is easy to overlook the changes in the labour market over the last
15 years. Yet many have been introduced to increase the ''flexibility''
of the labour market, to aid speedy adjustment to change, reduce
unemployment and enable growth without setting off wage inflation.
We have witnessed a substantial deregulation of the labour market, a
large reduction in public sector employment, major reductions in the
visible indicators of union power, reduced coverage and decentralisation
of collective bargaining, and greater emphasis on individual pay-fixing.
This demonstrates that the Government's agenda for labour market
reform at the start of the 1980s has been impressively achieved --
perhaps exceeding its own expectations.
But if the aim was to achieve an improvement in the trade-off between
pay rises and job creation in favour of jobs through a more flexible
labour market, it is not evident that this has delivered the goods.
Although employment growth has resumed with recovery, it has largely
taken the form of part-time jobs, mainly filled by women.
That, of course, is now a fact of life in the contemporary labour
market. It is remarkable that in 1993 for the first time the number of
women in employment in Scotland marginally outnumbered male employees
with jobs. Over the labour force as a whole, including self-employed and
unemployed, the male/female ratio is around 55:45. What these figures do
not show is that around 45% of women in employment are in part-time
work, and that while such work continues to trend upwards, full-time
jobs, especially filled by men, drift down.
This of course is just one dimension of the new flexibility in the
labour market, alongside the rise in the use of temporary contracts and
the growth of self-employed self-contractors.
Taken together, part-time and temporary work, plus self-employment,
account for a quarter of the male jobs in the UK economy and over 50% of
female jobs. In Scotland the proportions are marginally lower but the
same trends of growth are to be observed. However, Scotland's later
entry into recession and the lesser severity of the downturn here have,
if anything, brought Scotland and the rest of Britain further into line
in this respect.
Two consequences of this are worth noting. First: since the beginnings
of the 1990-92 recession, the Scottish unemployment rate has improved
relative to that of Britain as a whole. Second: weekly earnings for
full-time manual workers in Scotland, having reached parity with the
rest of Britain in 1982-84, then declined during the latter 1980s,
recovered in 1989-92 but appear to be relapsing: the comparable figures
for women manual workers show a similar tendency to recover, at a lower
level.
How far these relative improvements are a reflection of the more
severe recession in parts of the south, and whether the improvements
will be maintained, remain to be seen.
Whatever the outcome in this respect, we ought to be giving more
thought to the implications of the recent trends in labour force and
employment composition for the longer term. It is understandable that
employers will wish to utilise whatever flexibility the market offers
them, especially when they are hard pressed by competition. But
flexibility in labour utilisation is not necessarily the same as access
to cheap labour, if its low cost is due to low quality, poorly trained
workers with no sense of employer-loyality or commitment. Yet some of
the policy measures of the last decade seem to have pointed employers in
that direction.
What surely matters is ''value for money'' per # of wage bill. A high
wage matched by high productivity is generally preferable to the
low-wage/low productivity scenario which still characterises some
industrial sectors.
Low wages, part-time and temporary employment and the growing number
of households with no employment income at all, are part of the price
for some dimensions of flexibility. Alongside this we can observe
expansion of employment in occupations in the upper ranges of the pay
distribution, leaving a widening gap in the middle. Further development
of that polarisation is likely to exaggerate existing economic
inequalities of income and employment opportunity, and there is arguably
a risk that the two sectors will become dislocated.
Were that to happen it could actually reduce the flexibility of the
labour market in critical areas, with implications for education and
training, pay determination mechanisms, and labour mobility. This
prospect needs careful watching.
Policy-makers have to ensure that we make the best use of our native
human capital in today's competitive, quality-minded world economy.
Employers need to ensure that not just the cost of labour, but its
productivity, commitment and sensitivity to ''the customer'' are taken
into account in the wage equation.
That does not mean we have to jettison our new-found flexibility, but
we do have to think about which areas of flexibility we really need for
the future and what we must spend to achieve it.

<TEXT>
ORANGE frogs are being seen across the country -- much to the surprise
of people who expect the good old British common frog to be green.
The orange types have been seen in garden ponds indulging in early
spring mating displays, according to wildlife experts at Cornwall
Wildlife Trust.
''If you put one of them on top of a jaffa orange, you wouldn't be
able to tell the difference -- they even have red eyes,'' said
herpetologist Mark Nicholson at the trust's centre in Truro.
''We have two male orange frogs and would like some orange female ones
for them to mate with.
''I would particularly like to study the spawn.
''There have been phone calls from people, mostly in the south but
also in Yorkshire, who have seen orange frogs.
''Some are also in various shades of yellow, cream, and pink.''
The freak frogs are simply uncamouflaged genetic deviants of the
common frog and Mr Nicholson believes warm weather could be the key to
their unexpected survival.
Tadpoles depend on warmth absorbed from the sun to speed their
development through their most hazardous stage of life.
Without the normal dark pigments, albino tadpoles are less able to
absorb warmth and would usually die.
However, their chances of growing up quickly enough to survive are
better in warmer areas.

OFFICE staff are working harder than ever, swamped under piles of
mail, plagued by unwanted telephone calls, and with their lunch breaks
cut to just 20 minutes, according to a survey published today.
White-collar staff are moving towards a Japanese-style working week of
12-hour days and work-filled evenings, it said.
The stress from all these pressures could be ''potentially extremely
harmful'' if it was not understood and controlled, the survey concluded.
Home life also could suffer, with average people spending five years
of their lives reading and writing letters, four years commuting, three
years on the phone -- but only 10 months talking to their families.
The survey of managers, conducted by pyschologist Dr David Lewis,
showed that:
* 84% reported that greater demands were being made on their time than
two years ago -- 37% said pressures had ''greatly increased''.
* The average lunch break was 20 minutes, while tea and coffee breaks
were no more than nine minutes.
* Only six minutes a day are spent going to the lavatory.
* Monday was the most hectic day, according to 62% -- while 58% said
Monday was the day they disliked most.
* Unscheduled phone calls, unexpected visitors, and junk mail were the
worst irritants.
''Downsizing'', mergers, and recession-induced cost-cutting were seen
as the principle reasons for the harder working week.
Meanwhile, it was reported that UK-owned electronics firms were more
likely to use Japanese-style working practices than Japanese-owned
plants in this country.
A report published today. also found that Japanese companies in the UK
work a longer week than their British or North American-owned rivals.

<HEADLINE>Nurses' pay offer 'thin end of wedge'</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979763454</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LABOUR warned yesterday that the Government's decision to give nurses
a 1% pay rise with an element of local pay bargaining on top was the
''thin end of the wedge''.
The Shadow Health Secretary, Mrs Margaret Beckett, said that, in
future, the Government would introduce blanket local pay structures,
without providing funds.
The Government has announced that nurses can negotiate up to 2% at
local level on top of their across-the-board 1% national rise this year.
However, the Royal College of Nurses, with 300,000 members, yesterday
rejected the award and warned that they would consider taking industrial
action.
Mrs Beckett side-stepped a question on whether a Labour Government
would give nurses an across-the-board rise of 3%, saying the level of
the rise was not what was making them angry. ''It's the absolute
dogmatic determination to introduce a system of local pay
determination,'' she told BBC Radio 4.
''People have watched this Government long enough to realise that this
is the thin end of the wedge. ''It's a local pay settlement for which
the money is probably there this year and, in future years, it will be
local pay settlements for which money may not be there.''
Mrs Beckett outlined Labour's plans to cut spending on health service
managers and make NHS trust boards more democratic.
Her remarks drew instant condemnation from Health Minister Gerry
Malone, who warned that they would lead to Labour councillors being in
control.
''This policy would be a recipe for chaos, incompetence, corruption,
and waste, as anyone who has followed Labour's lamentable record in
local government knows well,'' he said in a statement.

THE former Scottish Office Minister, Mr Allan Stewart, yesterday
declared he would prefer an independent Scotland to the ''unworkable
shambles'' of Labour's devolution proposals.
He signalled his intention to make the constitutional issue one of his
top priorities now that he has returned to the back benches after
resigning his ministerial post earlier this month after a fracas with
anti-motorway protesters.
However, he also made it clear he would be campaigning for the
maintenance of the Union and its development through ''evolution''
rather than devolution.
Asked what his second choice would be if his preferred option of the
status quo was no longer available, Mr Stewart said yesterday:
''Independence. Given the devil of devolution and the deep blue sea of
independence, I would go for independence.
''It is not a question I would prefer to have to answer, of course,
but if those were the two options that one was faced with, without
question I would go for an independent Scotland.''
Why was he going for the break-up of the Union when he could try to
save it through a devolved parliament?
''I don't think a devolved parliament would save it. I think a
devolved parliament as proposed simply results in an unworkable and
inherently unstable situation.''
Speaking on the Scottish Lobby programme on BBC2, Mr Stewart said
there were perfectly arguable constitutional alternatives to the present
position. His own view was that the Union should ''evolve but not
devolve'' and he therefore supported Scottish Secretary Ian Lang's
proposals for the extension of the Scottish Grand Committee.
''I also believe that independence is an arguable proposition. I don't
agree with it but it is arguable and at least intellectually coherent.
So, in principle, is federalism but I don't think it can be applied to
Britain for a number of practical reasons, although respecting the views
of those who put it forward.''

<PAGE>10</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979763456</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
POST offices will be hit by another national strike next month as part
of a union campaign against closures, it was announced yesterday.
The Communication Workers' Union has called a 24-hour walk-out in 20
areas, including Glasgow, London, and Bristol, on March 6.
The action follows a strike before Christmas which closed main post
offices across the country.
The union called on the public to support its campaign against
''back-door privatisation'', which it claimed had led to the closure of
750 crown post offices -- half the total -- during the last five years.
The union fears there will be fewer than 400 main offices by the end
of the decade unless the Post Office halts its programme of switching to
franchise outlets, such as supermarkets and other stores.
''The closure programme has already seen 7000 trained and experienced
counter clerks leave the Post Office, with as many 3500 to go by the
turn of the century,'' said UCW joint general secretary Alan Johnson.
''The industrial action is a direct response to the cries of anger
from hundreds of communities up and down the country who value their
local, publicly-owned post office.
''The Post Office cannot claim that franchised offices are more
popular or efficient -- this is simply a cost-cutting programme.''
The Post Office, which labelled the pre-Christmas walk out a ''flop'',
said it was ''very surprised'' that the union was calling another
strike.
''We will rely on the good sense of counter staff not to support this
pointless action,'' said a spokesman.
Postal collections and deliveries will not be affected.
The Post Office maintained it was not closing offices but was entering
into partnerships to give customers a better service, including improved
parking and longer opening hours.
The Post Office later said it expected only around 200 crown post
offices would be affected by the action and all sub-post offices would
be open.

IT is easy to spot the union leaders attending the Scottish Council
Forum at Gleneagles. They nervously watch the hotel's grand entrance as
they sip pre-dinner drinks, half-expecting revolutionary hordes to
charge in and point them out as class traitors.
Few would deny that the forum is an excellent way for union leaders,
politicians, and company directors to meet in convivial surroundings and
discuss the country's problems. It's just that the hotel is oh, so
comfortable. The workers' struggle should be, well, more of a struggle.
The etiquette of the occasion can prove difficult. At one forum
dinner, the then Secretary of State Malcolm Rifkind was delivering a
particularly Thatcherite speech. Bill Speirs of the Scottish TUC could
stand it no longer, and shouted a few challenging ripostes. His
neighbour, Lady So-and-So, fiercely whispered that ''Mr Rifkind is our
guest'' and the class struggle was postponed.
As delegates are shuffled around for the dinner seating plan,
conversations take on a surreal air. On one side a councillor will be
explaining the minutiae of a recent planning application, while on the
other the wife of a captain of industry will be recalling the day her
cleaning lady dropped dead in her house. Difficult to respond to that
one. ''I hate when that happens'' is hard to deliver with sincerity.
It is wrong to assume, of course, that the sprinkling of titled ladies
in the programme are merely there as appendages of their husbands,
intent only on having a hairdo and a sauna at Gleneagles. Many a gauche
male delegate has inquired of a lady whether she is enjoying the hotel's
shopping facilities only to be told that she is a professor of economics
and too involved in the ERM to even find them.
The trade unionists and Labour politicians also use the occasion to
quiz whichever Government Minister delivers the concluding address.
Rifkind always enjoyed the verbal clashes when Donald Dewar was Labour's
Shadow Secretary.
The current Scottish Secretary, Ian Lang, seemed less sure of facing
such criticism in the Gleneagles Ballroom. After many left-wing attacks
on Lang, the exasperated chairman asked if instead any company directors
had any points to put to the Secretary of State. Up popped Campbell
Christie of the STUC who pointed out he was a director of Falkirk
Football Club -- and had another go at Lang.
1 But it is not just the left-wingers who have the chance to air their
views. While everyone is very polite to each other during the day, later
on some more extreme views can let slip. Left-wingers can become
extremely apoplectic when, over a post-prandial brandy, someone of a
more right-wing nature explains that the solution to so many single
mothers is to put their children in orphanages and put the mothers to
work as domestics or whatever.
Although such an extreme view expressed a few years ago at Gleneagles
seemed outlandish then, it is of course what the Republicans who have
just taken control of the United States Senate are proposing.
So if trade unionists want an excuse for a late-night drink at
Gleneagles this week, they can argue that they are simply gathering
information on future attacks on the welfare state by the right. They'll
still be looking nervously at the doors, however.

THE power of central Government to cap council budgets damages local
accountability and autonomy and should be abolished, a study by
researchers at the University of Strathclyde has concluded.
In a report published today, Professor Arthur Midwinter and Mr Neil
McGarvey call for an end to the use of Government spending assessments
to set capping limits for each council.
The report comes at a time when Scottish councils are grappling with
the financial problems created by a tough, lower than inflation,
settlement for next year.
At the same time, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has said he would not
hesitate to act if councils set budgets above capping limits.
The report warns that the transition to single-tier councils will be
difficult to manage smoothly while big services are being broken up.
Budgetary pressures, it says, will increase over the next two years.
It concludes ''It cannot be sensible to have a system in place in
which the bulk of local finances are raised by central Government yet it
still imposes spending controls on the element of income which is raised
locally.
''That is stretching any concept of accountability and the link the
Government itself makes between taxation and accountability is a tenuous
one in such circumstances.''
Professor Midwinter and Mr McGarvey however have better news for the
Government over the implementation of the property-based council tax.
In the study, which was commissioned by the Chartered Association of
Certified Accountants, they conclude that the new tax has been a success
and has defused the political problem of local government finance.
It was found that the level of satisfaction with the council tax
banding system was considerable and a 96-98% collection rate had been
achieved.

A dispute over the actions of the public sector union's political
committee has already led to the resignation as shop steward of Mr Keith
Brown, who is SNP transport spokesperson.
Mr Brown has claimed that Unison refused to debate the subject at its
summer school on Saturday while a union spokesman said Mr Brown had
failed to win support of any member to his branch's motion.
However, the SNP, while claiming some Unison members intended to
contact the Commissioner for Trade Union Rights over the ballot,
yesterday distanced itself from the resignation.
SNP trade union group convener Bill Ramsay said: ''While Keith's
frustration and anger is perfectly understandable, it is not the policy
of the SNP to encourage resignation as a tactic.'' The party dissociated
itself from Mr Brown's actions, he added.
Two attempts by the union's Stirling district branch to debate actions
of its political committee led to Mr Brown walking out of the school and
announcing his decision to quit the union.
Ms Anne McNair, a Unison senior steward and secretary to the SNP's
trade union group, said yesterday: ''The union is misleading its
membership by the way in which it is conducting its current political
fund ballot.''
Her group believed Unison was attempting to hide what political
affiliation existed within any ballot vote, and Ms McNair confirmed that
some Unison members intended to question the legality of the political
fund ballot.

SCOTTISH law courts have been urged to adopt an American-style verdict
system after a blunder by a jury foreman allowed two youths to walk free
from an attempted murder charge.
The mistake, at the end of a nine-day trial at the High Court in
Glasgow, also prompted demands from both Labour and Conservative MPs for
a change in the law which would allow such an error to be immediately
redressed.
The jury had found Derek McDowall and Gerald Gilmartin, both 17, of
Glasgow, guilty of carrying out a knife and baton attack on two other
youths in the city last December.
However, the jury foreman told the judge, Lord Cameron, that it had
found the case not proven. Even more remarkably, he repeated the wrong
verdict several minutes later after the clerk of the court had recorded
it in the court minutes and asked him if this was an accurate record of
its decision.
The mistake emerged only after the two teenagers had left the court
building and startled jury members complained to a court official that
the foreman had blundered.
However, Lord Cameron ruled that the verdict had to stand, as no
dissent was voiced by any member of the jury when asked by the clerk if
the decision was, in fact, a true and accurate reflection.
Mr John McFall, Labour's Home Affairs spokesman in Scotland, yesterday
described the incident as ''totally bizarre'' and revealed that he would
be raising the matter urgently with the Scottish Office.
''I find it totally astonishing that such a mistake occurred in the
first place,'' he said. ''But what is equally worrying is the fact that,
once it was discovered, there was no opportunity for any recourse.
''It has to be remembered also that we are talking about an extremely
serious charge. Perhaps we should adopt a system whereby the jury writes
down its verdict, passes it to the court official, who would then read
it out and ask them if it was correct.
''This would provide some form of safeguard that the correct verdict
was being given,'' added the MP. ''There must be something to ensure
that such mistakes can also be overturned in future.''
The Opposition spokesman confirmed that he intended to raise the issue
with the Crown Office as well as in the Commons when the Criminal
Justice Bill returns in several weeks from the Lords.
Similarly, Mr Bill Walker, the Conservative MP for Tayside North,
argued that there had to be some mechanism in place to correct such
errors. ''I believe that we should look at this very carefully and
perhaps the most appropriate time would be when the Criminal Justice
Bill returns to the Commons,'' he explained.
''This simply cannot be allowed to happen and there must be something
to ensure that such a mistake can be addressed.''
Mr Andrew Hardie, Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, said yesterday
that he believed this was the first time such a situation had arisen.
''What surprises me is that nobody on the jury said anything at the
time, either to the foreman or the clerk.
''If such confusion had arisen, then I am sure that the judge would
have sent the jury back to rectify its decision before proceeding.
''Once the foreman has been asked for the verdict, the clerk writes
this out and then reads it back to the jury, asking them if it was
accurate. The whole process takes a wee while and I would have thought
that someone on the jury would have raised the matter then,'' he
continued.
Mr Hardie admitted that he would have no difficulty in accepting an
American-style system whereby the decision was also written out and
passed to the judge before being announced by the jury foreman.

A LABOUR MP described the Government's fascination with NHS trusts as
''total folly'' after surveying the accounts of the first two waves of
Scotland's trust hospitals.
The research by Mr Brian Donohoe, the MP for Cunninghame South,
reveals the levels of payments made to executive and non-executive
directors of the trusts, as well as the salary levels of trust chief
executives.
The survey states that the total paid to directors for 1993/94 was
#4,964,000. Chairmen of the trusts were paid a total of #308,000 and
chief executives a total of #1,023,000.
The highest-paid chief executive was Mr Alec Cumming, who works for
Aberdeen Royal Hospitals NHS Trust. In 1993/94, he earned #79,000,
excluding pension contributions.
The lowest-paid chief executive was Mr George Buchanan, of Caithness
and Sutherland NHS Trust, who earned #42,000, excluding pension
contributions.
Correspondingly, the lowest level of payments made to trust directors
was made by Caithness and Sutherland. The directors received #211,000.
Directors at Aberdeen Royal Hospitals NHS Trust were the best paid,
earning a total of #362,000.
Mr Donohoe said: ''The amounts paid to the directors and the lack of
public accountability of these trusts to the public demonstrates the
total folly of the Government's fascination with trust status.''

When Scottish industrialists, trade unionists and their guests gather
at the Gleneagles Hotel this week for the Scottish Council Forum 1995,
there will be much to discuss -- not least the meaning of 'work' in our
new society. Alf Young sets the scene while other interested parties add
their voices
IN recent years the innocent question ''And what are you going to do
when you grow up?'' has taken on a new, more sinister resonance. My
generation has grown more cautious about quizzing the young openly in
such presumptive terms. Uttering the words now triggers the dark,
unspoken thought: ''Will there be anything for you to do when you grow
up?''
It is no longer a surprise to hear company executives or senior civil
servants muse, along with the broad mass of ordinary humanity, about
their unemployed offspring's fruitless search for work. At the other end
of the age scale, to be 50-plus and still working full-time is to be the
odd man or woman out in more and more sectors, like banking.
In these and other ways the world of work is changing dramatically,
before our very eyes. The old certainties summed up in phrases like ''a
job for life'' and inscribed on barrowloads of long-service gold watches
are crumbling. Traditional work patterns are dissolving and reforming in
new, potentially alarming ways.
At an anecdotal level, the scare stories are legion. European airlines
beginning to route all ticket processing through India, where skilled
computer operatives, linked by satellite, are overjoyed to work for less
than $1000 a year. Graduate-level Chinese queuing by the hundred for
jobs in Western factories at pay rates around $500 a year. Electronics
executives warning that, if the labour content of any product exceeds
15%, there is now no longer any point making it in Europe.
When we are not exporting work to lower-cost parts of the world,
intense competitive pressures are forcing more and more of our employers
to casualise their workforces. Short contracts. Temporary assignments.
Part-time work. Peak-time work. These, rather than permanent careers
with clearly-defined promotion paths, are the options facing more and
more people, if they can find work at all. For those lucky enough to be
still in permanent full-time employment, there is mounting fear that
such luck must soon run out.
Europe, according to the OECD, now has 35 million unemployed and
perhaps another 15 million who have either given up the search or
unwillingly accepted a part-time economic role. In some OECD member
countries, up to a third of young workers have no job.
For every 10 jobs which existed in 1960 in what is now the European
Union, there are only 11 now. By contrast, in the past 35 years Japan
has created one additional job for every two which existed in 1960.
North America has doubled employment in the same period.
Critics point to Europe's sclerotic labour market. Our fondness for
inflation-driven pay deals. And an unsustainable social welfare system.
America has created 41 million new jobs since 1970, it is argued,
because of a more dynamic and enterprising economy and the willingness
of millions of workers there to accept a smaller pay packet now, in real
terms, than they did a quarter of a century before.
Add to this explosive cocktail the impact of technology, with
intelligent machines and processes leveraging human effort in ways
unimaginable just a generation ago, and it is clear that no debate could
be more pressing than jobs, work and growth in Europe, the UK, and
Scotland as we pass into a new millennium.
The Scottish Council has never shirked the big issues. And because of
the rainbow array of interests it can gather at its annual forum, it can
bring the widest possible range of experience to focus on how we should
be responding to the changing patterns employment in our society.
While the political debate still seems stuck in the ritual claim and
counterclaim of who will get us back to old-style full employment, this
week's forum is an important opportunity to get behind the rhetoric and
confront the real issue.

LIKE any other child, Sean McKinlay might occasionally not realise his
own strength. In his case, it is not entirely his own.
Over the past year, he has been getting used to an electronically
controlled hand, fitted at Glasgow's Southern General hospital last
February.
Sean, two, from Largs in Ayrshire, was born with his right arm ending
in a stump with only vestigial fingers.
He is one of about 20 children born in coastal regions around Britain
over the last six years suffering from such deformities. No reason has
yet been found by scientists.
The defects have appeared in clusters in several areas, including the
south coast of England and Ayrshire. Various theories have been put
forward. Emissions from power stations such as Hunterston on the
Ayrshire coast and Sellafield in Cumbria have been blamed.
After the initial excitement of having the hand fitted a year ago,
Sean went through a spell of rejecting it.
''He went through a stage when he didn't like it,'' said his mother
Mrs Karen McKinlay, 22. ''I can understand that and I think the novelty
must have worn off for a while. I realised I had to persevere. It was
very difficult persuading him to wear it but I realised that it was for
his own good. It was one of those problems that other mothers in my
position will have to overcome.
''But now he loves using it. He even likes showing his hand off to
visitors.''
Sean was the youngest child in Britain to be fitted with the device.
''When he was given the chance of this hand, we were overjoyed,'' Mrs
McKinlay said. ''He was just over a year old.It was a really marvellous
occasion for the whole family.''
Her husband Mark, 31, a printer, said: ''It has made all the
difference to Sean, who is right-handed. It means he's able to do most
of the things that any boy of his age can.''
The hand has two fingers that open and close to meet the ''thumb''.
Impulses are controlled by muscles in Sean's arm which activate a sensor
operating a motor in the hand.
As Sean grows, he will be given a larger hand. The units cost about
#1500 to produce, including the control system.
They have been developed by an English firm and are prepared
individually for fitting by scientists at Strathclyde University's
National Centre for Training and Education in Prosthetics.
Lecturer Bill Dykes said the hands were now being adapted for a
variety of children in Scotland with arm and hand deficiencies.
The family has had the support of Reach, an organisation which raises
cash for research into the causes of upper limb deficiencies. Reach's
national co-ordinator is Mrs Sue Stokes, 0604 811041.

Geoffrey Parkhouse,Political Editor, gives a personal view of a man
who could love and hate with equal passion and could always count on
gaining attention if not affection
THE last time I spoke to Nick Fairbairn, he had intimations of
mortality. ''I don't care what you say about me when I'm dead -- won't
be long now -- so long as you don't describe me as nice.'' I said I
could oblige him, and do so now.
You might as well describe a rose as pretty. Nice would be inadequate
and untruthful. Nicky could be exceedingly nasty, and in drink,
particularly to women. Pigheaded too; as we spoke, he was defying
authority with a vodka and orange in his hand.
He believed that his life was ending, so what the hell. He had just
finished the last chapter of the second volume of his memoirs which he
told me he was devoting to those he loved and hated in politics. He had
addressed his targets (for both) with the most direct candour, he said.
I shuddered for them. I shuddered again when he said that I was to get
a special mention in his new book. Heaven knows why because we were
acquaintances rather than close friends, although I suppose acquaintance
over 20 years with the likes of him becomes either enmity or friendship.
We were friends, then, in our mutually bluff way. I honour his memory by
acknowledging that there should be no in-between relationships.
Our male generation was conditioned to display affection by intense
and sustained mickey-taking, or what others (particularly women, he
thought) not on the same wavelength were shocked to regard as insult.
Nicky was nasty if you took him wrong. He constantly tested you to see
if you could take it at all. ''What crap are you writing tonight,
****house?'' he would greet me.
He loved women with a romantic passion that sometimes got him into
serious trouble. He would labour over poems to them, placing them on
pedestals and describing his adoration with vigorous and sometimes
salacious candour. He told me: ''I can't understand why people think I'm
rude to women. I idolise them, so long as they remain female.
''When I give myself to a woman, I give everything of myself: my body,
my mind, my art.'' The occasional buffeting too? I asked. He looked at
me long and hard with eyes that filled with tears. He launched into an
introspective attack on himself that was the harshest I ever heard made
on him.
Dark despair walked regularly with Fairbairn. This, he thought, might
explain his chief eccentricity, his constant desire for publicity. He
found it a cushion against his inner thoughts which often disturbed him.
''Anyway, it is a politician's duty to use words daringly in order to
attract attention to his beliefs.''
I doubt if women Tory MPs, particularly Edwina Currie, will ever think
of him kindly after what he said about them. ''I'm only saying in public
what everybody thinks in private,'' he used to protest, deeply injured
that he was not admired for so doing. He rarely fathomed the wrong he
did in this regard and when he did recognise it, he did so without
remorse.
He claimed that he regretted nothing. ''Regrets are futile,'' he would
say. But he would also assert that he was a man of exceptional talents
and vision, arguing with some bitterness that he had wasted at least
some of those talents. His political career was stunted by forced
resignation, only partially the result of an affair that became
notorious.
Thereafter he regarded himself in the House of Commons as being
surrounded by pygmies on all sides. He rearranged his loyalties to take
account of this, he told me, in the knowledge that the ''pygmies''
regarded him as discredited. ''I can still command a hearing in the
Chamber, but only because they don't know what I'm going to say next. It
is my only remaining political pleasure.''
I will miss him. When he hove into sight you'd say: ''Here comes
trouble.'' That was the nice thing about him.

A SURVEY published today claims to demonstrate how UK firms could be
losing valuable contracts because their staff are unable to answer
foreign language speakers calling to place orders.
As trade barriers drop across Europe, the team behind the survey says
its research shows UK firms are hopelessly inadequate when potential
foreign customers call.
Foreign language experts LinguaTel, which provides firms with
interpreters, telephoned 100 exporters from a list of the UK's 50,000
major companies.
Speaking French, German or Italian, they tested the ability of
switchboard staff to understand a foreign language.
They asked operators: ''I would like some information on your company.
Can you help me please?''
If they managed to get through to a marketing executive, they asked:
''Can you send me a brochure or catalogue containing some of your
products.''
The firms tested included Bass, Forte, Allied Lyons, Hanson, Marks &amp;
Spencer, Shell, Rank, and Thorn EMI.
In 74% of cases, calls were abandoned at the switchboard as no-one
understood what was being asked. Two-thirds of callers who did get
through to sales departments found no-one could speak their language.
In some cases, callers were kept waiting for up to six minutes while
an attempt was made to find someone who could speak the caller's
language.
Between the switchboards and the sales departments, only one in five
calls were handled competently.
Of those French callers, 52% were abandoned. More than 70% of callers
were cut off by sales and marketing staff.
Of German calls, 60% were abandoned by the switchboard and 80% cut off
by sales staff.
Italian speakers fared worst, with 81% of calls abandoned by
switchboards. Of those who did get through, 72% failed to make
themselves understood.
LinguaTel sales manager, Mr Bob Cole, said last night: ''Our survey
shows conclusively that British companies believe everyone should speak
English.
''Firms in this country are clearly not ready to field inquiries from
foreigners and consequently are missing out on business.
''When trading barriers are being removed all across Europe, British
exporters are coming under increasing competition.
''Our research demonstrates many UK companies are at a huge language
disadvantage to many of their overseas competitors.
''The Department of Trade and Industry has spent millions trying to
educate businesses to learn the foreign languages of many of their
clients. But it seems precious few firms have taken any notice.''
LinguaTel have now drawn up free prompt cards to help switchboard
staff to deal with overseas callers.

SCOTLAND'S oldest working theatre has been officially designated as an
important part of Europe's cultural heritage.
The 203-year-old Theatre Royal in Dumfries is the only one in Scotland
and one of seven in Britain included by the European Commission in a
list of 61 historic buildings and sites related to entertainment and the
performing arts. They were selected for their ''historic, architectural,
artistic, and social value of European importance''. Each receives a
grant to carry out improvements.
The Guild of Players, an amateur group which owns the theatre, has
been awarded about #28,000 which will go towards the second phase of a
refurbishment programme. The work, costing #100,000, will include the
consolidation of the facade, the reconstruction of the stage roof, and
the restoration of the exterior walls and wooden decorations.
The guild is determined the building, one of the country's smallest
theatres, which has links with Robert Burns, will look its best for next
year's 200th anniversary celebrations of the poet's death in Dumfries.
In the last years of his life, he patronised the theatre and wrote
prologues for the actresses.
Mr Peter Moore, master of the guild, said: ''We have already completed
phase one -- the reconstruction of the main roof at a cost of about
#90,000 -- and the scaffolding is now up ready for the second phase. We
are also talking about a possible third phase to enlarge the theatre but
that is still at an early stage.''
The guild has received a #25,000 loan from Dumfries and Galloway
Regional Council and a grant from the local enterprise company. The
building, bought by the guild in 1959, has been an auction hall, roller
skating rink, and cinema.
The European Commission's list includes some of the most prestigious
theatres and opera houses in Europe. Some, such as the Opera-Grand
Casino, in Vichy, France, the Teatro Peteuzzelli in Bari, Italy, and the
Shauspielhaus in Berlin are positively palatial.* The new general
manager of Dundee Rep theatre is to be Ms Joanna Reid, who currently
runs the London-based Actors Touring Company. She succeeds Mr Nick Jones
who becomes drama director at the Arts Council of England.

Robbie Dinwoodie,recalls the colourful and combative life of Sir
Nicholas Fairbairn who died yesterday
EARLIER this month Sir Nicholas Fairbairn paused in conversation and
gazed out from his beloved Fordell Castle across the 200 acres of his
estate in Fife. ''Isn't it lovely this winter?'' he observed, ''this sun
and light and straggles of snow. We have had it for months now. It is
absolutely wonderful.''
A brief silence followed, a shared moment of intimacy, recognition
that these were words spoken by a man who knew he was savouring the last
of life. He had just given The Herald what would prove to be his final
interview, and it was a splendid valedictory blast, defiant in the face
of impending death, outspoken in its withering disdain for the grey
careerists of modern politics, spectacularly ''wrong'' by any measure of
political correctness, and justifiably proud of the quart of experience
he has poured into a pint pot of existence over just 61 years.
The mood was far from morbid. Rather it was a reflection on a full
life. Colourful does not begin to describe it. His style, bravado and
zest at times made it all too easy for him to be dismissed as an
eccentric -- as in the particularly cruel put down, from a leading light
in the legal establishment: ''Nicky's a man of many talents. It's a pity
he never developed any of them.''
It was a remark which said as much about the role of Sir Nicholas in
making himself a professional member of the awkward squad, as it did
about any of his shortcomings. The lie was given to this in any event by
his many tangible achievements. Having conquered his first career in law
and become the finest High Court pleader of his generation, in 1974 he
made the move into politics which his wit and eloquence marked him out
for.
He rose in reputation at Westminster and became the obvious candidate
for the post of Solicitor-General in 1979. But when a decision was taken
three years later not to prosecute the gang-rapists of the Glasgow woman
identified as ''Carol X'' -- because it was feared her mental health
would make a successful prosecution unlikely -- there was a public storm
and Sir Nicholas was left with no choice but to resign.
Flawed genius might be his epitaph, since both his achievements and
failures were so public, but the latter should not overshadow the
former. He made himself a Renaissance man with achievements in the law,
politics, and the arts. He was by his own designations a farmer,
painter, dress-designer, architectural restorer and collector of
artefacts (returning Fordell to 16th century glory was a labour of love
for him for more than three decades), poet, writer, broadcaster and
public speaker.
Such breadth of achievement was bound to attract criticisms of lack of
depth, or gentle mockery in some quarters, but it brought colour and a
sense of fun to Scottish life. The couture for his second wedding in
1983 enabled Herald writer Jack Webster to pen one of the great
openings: ''. . . oyster-coloured silk organza with high neck, broad
belt of seed pearls, cream silk trousers and red velvet slippers with
gold trim. And that was just the bridegroom.''
Nicky, as he was universally known, was born Nicholas Hardwick
Fairbairn on Christmas Eve, 1933, the son of a psychiatrist. Tory blood
ran in his youthful veins, and although a later political CV would say
he had ''taken an active party in all General Elections since 1945'',
his first involvement was breaking the windows of the local Co-op in
protest at Labour's post-war election victory, an act for which he was
''profoundly beaten''.
Educated at Loretto College in Edinburgh, he decided to follow in his
father's medical footsteps but hated it. Part of the way through his
first year at Edinburgh University, he went to see a film in which the
hero was a successful lawyer -- the timing suggests Clarence Darrow. He
decided there and then on his future, changed course and graduated MA
and LLB.
He was called to the Scots Bar in 1957. As a junior advocate the
following year, he witnessed Lord Cameron place the sentence of death
upon the infamous Peter Manuel, and, recalling the experience 30 years
later, he said: ''Power and cruelty gazed at each other in defiance, the
one in superior and righteous triumph, the other in mortal and final
defeat. We were in the presence of death and those who play with it.''
He acquired a taste for that deadly confrontation. A lawyer of
excellence, he became a brilliant defence advocate. As a leading QC, he
represented clients who, together, make up a list of the most celebrated
accused from the 60s and early 70s -- men like Walter Scott Ellis,
Patrick Meehan, and Jimmy Boyle.
In Scotland and abroad he defended 17 people who were facing the death
penalty but never once lost a client to the hangman. Although Sir
Nicholas made his name as a stout and eloquent defender of civil
liberties and as a lawyer who was keen to challenge the indecency laws
during the sixties, he looked back almost regretfully on his defence of
Jimmy Boyle.
His distaste for Boyle's prison protests and eventual release was
apparent in his later comment: ''He obtained a heroism for his misdeeds
that good men rarely obtain for valour.''
The drift rightwards from champion of civil liberties to Tory
right-winger was already under way. After unsuccessful parliamentary
campaigns in Edinburgh Central in 1964 and 1966, he entered Westminster
as MP for the safe Tory seat of Kinross and West Perthshire in 1974,
succeeding former Premier Sir Alec Douglas-Home.
Just over two years into his term as Solicitor-General controversy in
his private life spilled into tabloid headlines alleging that the MP's
Commons secretary had tried to hang herself from a lamp-post outside his
London flat over the ending of an affair between them. She later made
clear that the hanging incident was a fabrication, but admitted taking
an overdose.
This cloud over his private life meant he was particularly susceptible
to criticism when the storm broke a few months later over the Carol X
rape case. The marking of ''no proceedings'' against cases deemed
unwinnable are common in the legal system, but the press bayed, the
woman sought a private prosecution, and the Solicitor-General was
bounced into resignation.
He resigned from office but not from the headlines. Nor did he become
more resigned by nature. He was divorced from his first wife -- he had
three daughters by Elizabeth Mackay, daughter of Lord Reay, Chief of the
Clan Mackay -- and cited in another divorce, that of Suzanne MacInnes,
estranged wife of a London businessman.
It was for his wedding to ''Lady Sam'' in 1983 that he designed the
outfits. There was similar sartorial splendour five years later when he
arrived for his investiture at Buckingham Palace. A devoted royalist and
virulent anti-Scottish Nationalist, the new knight disdained outfits
''that appear to be mourning clothes for the late Prince Albert''.
Instead, the man who once gave his ambition as the destruction of the
necktie and lounge suite as symbols of respectability, wore Gordon kilt,
jacket and plaid, set off by a feathered bonnet, which the Queen
reportedly described as splendid.
Against the predictions of the political pundits he held on to Perth
and Kinross in the face of a fierce SNP onslaught at the last General
Election, and that in spite of one of his typically indelicate outbursts
predicting that under Labour Britain would be ''swamped'' by immigrants
of every colour and race. Last year he said he would not be standing
again, citing the preponderance of grey, party clones who have taken
over Westminster.
The Tory Whips in recent months have made no effort to drag Sir
Nicholas to Westminster, realising that as a deep-rooted Europhobe and
general awkward customer he may well have voted against the Government
in any case.
Instead, he fought his terminal liver disease and devoted himself to
his painting and writing, gazing across his little bit of Fife as Baron
of Fordell. His first exhibition of paintings was in 1960, when he was
proud to record that 71 were sold. His last goes ahead next month and he
had hoped to be present. The second volume of his autobiography, and his
debut as a novelist, will now also be posthumous. It is a great pity
for, good or bad, Nicholas Fairbairn always enjoyed being reviewed.

<HEADLINE>Lord Hope has relaxed attitude to a question of judgment</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND'S most senior judge, Lord Hope, remained very much at ease
last night over a judge more junior than himself questioning one his
rulings. ''If I am criticised, that's part of the job,'' he told The
Herald.
The ruling in question is one which Lord Hope, the Lord Justice
General, made in an appeal concerning a building society robbery. He and
two fellow two judges on the Bench ruled that new evidence could be
heard at the appeal, even though it could have been led at the original
trial.
Until now, new evidence could be used in an appeal only if it could
not have been available at the original trial.
On Friday however, Lord Ross, Lord Justice Clerk, and essentially
number two to Lord Hope, said at another appeal, where the defence
advocate was hoping to exploit the Lord Hope ruling, that some members
of the court had some doubts over the ruling, and he and his fellow two
judges sitting on the appeal, asked for a bench of five judges to be
convened to reconsider the ruling.
As Bruce McKain, the Herald's law correspondent pointed out in
Saturday's newspaper, Lord Hope's ruling could open the floodgates to
miscarriage of justice appeals.
Some observers may think that Lord Hope would not take kindly to the
implicit criticism by his deputy in Friday's hearing but, in fact, he
took a relaxed view, explaining that it was simply the ordinary way in
which the court worked. ''This is how the law is developed in the
court,'' he explained.
As to whether the floodgates would be opened if his ruling was upheld
by the bench of five judges which will now consider the matter, he was
more guarded, stating that it was best to wait and see what the judges
ruled.
He himself will not be able to be part of the bench because of
pressure of business. It is likely, therefore, to be presided over by
Lord Ross.
Lord Hope did explain, though, that he did not regard the law as a
fixture and that it evolved constantly.
He even took the step of being interviewed on the Radio Scotland
programme Eye To Eye yesterday, to talk about the circumstances --
something he admitted that his predecessor never did.
He said he felt there were issues where the public should hear from
him, and equally he felt he benefited from meeting people of other
disciplines, including journalists.
As to Lord Ross's intervention, Lord Hope said: ''He is quite right to
take the view, if he thinks that he is uneasy about what I've said, that
this is something which is sufficiently important to go to five judges.
A court of five judges can be convened within a matter of weeks.
''The particular appeal with which we are dealing will not be greatly
delayed by this and it's the proper way in which, if there is a
difference of view, the matter should be resolved.''
He added: ''The court is perfectly entitled to question what I say and
test the argument in order to be sure that the decision that is reached
is the right one.''
He also told listeners that the judicial system had to keep up to date
and be aware of developments in various fields, such as human rights and
public confidence in the courts.
Lord Hope was perhaps too much of a gentleman to explain that, in any
case, he has questioned rulings of Lord Ross in the past, so his pride
appears to be capable of taking it as well as giving it.

THREE rail unions have agreed in principle to join one of the four
groups bidding to build and operate the #2700m Channel Tunnel rail link.
The General, Municipal, and Boilermakers union was the first to accept
the ground-breaking invitation, the impetus for which came from major
German multi-nationals in the Anglo-German-Japanese consortium.
The agreement, which has still to be ratified by union executives,
would involve the GMB, the Rail, Maritime, and Transport union, Aslef,
the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association, and perhaps the Transport
and General Workers' union, buying into the consortium for the combined
sum of about #300,000.
In return they would each get a seat on the supervisory board of the
consortium and be involved from the onset in health and safety and the
establishment of industrial relations procedures.
The TGWU has still to decide whether to join this ''social
partnership'' which, although unique in Britain, is commonplace in
Germany and very much in line with EU practice which the Government has
been trying to stave off by opting out.
GMB general secretary John Edmonds described the union involvement in
the consortium as the latest example of the reality of European Social
Partnership arriving in Britain despite the opposition of the Tories. He
expects it to become the industrial relations model of the future.
The unions see the partnership deal as a means of securing recognition
and gaining and retaining members. This is particularly important during
the eight-year construction stage when up to 10,000 building jobs will
be created. For this reason, the TGWU may feel obliged to join the
consortium rather than leave the field clear for the GMB.
The rail unions insist the agreement should not be seen as acceptance
of the Government's rail privatisation plan, which will be challenged in
the High Court later this week by the RMT.
The consortium includes German construction giant Hochtief and
electronics group Siemens, UK builders Costain, Hambros Bank, and
Nisimatsu of Japan.
There are at least four consortia bidding for the contract, which is
expected to be awarded this year, to build and operate the 70-mile link
and terminals at London's Waterloo and St Pancras stations.
The Channel Tunnel rail link is the biggest potential partnership
scheme but the unions maintain there are other possibilities which could
attract the involvement of foreign construction firms and therefore be
open to similar partnership deals. These could include the #1000m West
Coast Rail Line modernisation plan and a batch of privatised
road-building projects.

THE right-wing stranglehold on the leadership of Britain's largest
manufacturing union, the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical union,
appears to be in jeopardy as a result of deep divisions over who should
succeed Mr Bill Jordan as president.
About 240 right-wing AEEU activists who met in Leyland, Lancashire, at
the weekend to decide on their candidate split right down the middle
before deciding, by just one vote, to back executive member for Tyneside
Mr Jackie Crystal.
Midlands executive member Mr John Allan, who was just pipped for the
nomination, stormed out and there were fears that he might stand against
the ''official'' right-wing candidate.
Either way, Mr Crystal cannot be assured of winning the all-important
Midlands vote.
Until his death a few weeks ago, the right-wing camp had an agreed
strong candidate in 54-year-old Mr John Weakley, executive member for
South Wales, who was fully expected to succeed Mr Jordan. He has moved
to Brussels as the first British general secretary of the International
Confederation of Free Trades Unions.
Despite this continuing disarray in the opposition camp, Mr Jimmy
Airlie, AEEU executive member for Scotland, is standing by his decision,
revealed in The Herald last week, not to stand for the presidency and to
take early retirement in November 1996.
At a meeting of the left-wing ''gazette'' group of AEEU activists in
Preston yesterday, Mr Airlie spoke up strongly for 43-year-old Mr Davy
Hall, who was subsequently adopted as the left-wing nominee.
Since his election as Tyne district secretary of the AEEU and the
Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering unions, Mr Hall has made
such an impact that he is expected to attract many of the North-east of
England votes that Mr Crystal would have expected to win if he was the
sole ''Geordie'' candidate.
There was optimism at yesterday's Preston meeting that the right-wing
domination of the AEEU might be about to receive a severe jolt.
Because the AEEU is in a state of transition, only members of the
dominant engineering section, the former AEU, will vote in the
presidential election this summer.
It remains to be seen what implications a left-wing victory would have
for the precarious AEEU amalgamation as the electrical section, the
former EETPU, is way to the right of the engineering section leadership.

THE annual attendance at the National Galleries of Scotland has set a
new record. The figure of 897,222 visitors to the three galleries in
1994 was up almost 100% on a decade ago.
The galleries presented two ground-breaking exhibitions in 1994. Monet
to Matisse won the Critics' Award for best visual arts show in the
Edinburgh Festival. The other, The Romantic Spirit in German Art, was
subsequently seen in London and is currently attracting huge audiences
in Munich.
The past 10 years have seen a significant increase in loans to UK and
foreign venues, the highlight of which was a tour of 80 masterpieces
from the National Galleries to three Japanese venues.

<TEXT>
POVERTY and unemployment could be linked to the causes of crime,
Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley said yesterday.
However, he insisted that social deprivation was not the sole cause or
an excuse for criminal behaviour.
Mr Lilley, a leading Cabinet right winger, appeared to call into
question a central belief of Tory Ministers over the past 15 years --
that there was no link between crime and poverty.
Labour's social security spokesman, Mr Donald Dewar, said he was
''genuinely glad'' to note the apparent shift because it finally paved
the way for a full analysis of the causes of crime.
Mr Lilley said on ITV's Jonathan Dimbleby programme: ''We don't know
in full the causes of crime. Clearly, crime depends on criminality but
those who are disposed to crime are presumably more likely to exercise
that if they don't have opportunities of getting a good living.
''Being poor manifestly does not cause people to be criminals. There
are rich criminals and most poor people are honest and law-abiding.
''But there are some people who are disposed to crime and they are
more likely to enter into a life of crime if that offers a more
rewarding prospect than a life of modest earnings or on the dole.''
Mr Lilley said he fully backed the Home Secretary, Mr Michael Howard,
in his claims that crime could not be excused by poverty.
''Poverty does not cause crime. It is an insult to people on the dole
to say they are all potential criminals or driven into crime. That is
monstrous. Crime is committed by criminals.''

THE Prime Minister's son James has denied claims that he had an affair
with an older married woman.
He is named in divorce papers filed by the husband of Marks &amp; Spencer
branch deputy manager Elaine Jordache, 32.
Trainee manager James, 19, and Mrs Jordache worked together at the
firm's Cambridge store.
Rumours that the pair were having an affair arose because Mr Michael
Jordache, 41, named James in his divorce papers.
The allegations come only weeks after stories that Mr John Major had
an affair with an older divorcee when he was a young man himself.
Mrs Jordache is seeking a divorce from her husband on the grounds of
unreasonable behaviour, accusing him of obssessive jealousy and verbal
and physical abuse, according to the News of the World.
Mr Jordache is cross-petitioning for divorce on the grounds of his
wife's unreasonable behaviour.
Mr Jordache, who runs a card and gift shop in Cambridge, claimed that
Mr Major became besotted with his wife, adding: ''I think he'd made his
feelings plain to her, which is bang out of order because she's
married.''
He describes in his petition how he found James Major cuddling his
wife during a pyjama party at their home.
He told a Sunday newspaper that he had a row with his wife during the
party and found her later in the arms of Mr Major.
Mr Jordache said he later threatened to call the police unless Mr
Major left, and added that he did not seem too bothered.
Mr Jordache told the paper his wife claimed Mr Major was being
over-protective towards her because he fancied her.
However, Mr Jordache said he found the couple alone together in a
Cambridge pub on another occasion and discovered that his wife had been
calling Mr Major regularly on her mobile phone.
According to another Sunday newspaper, Mr Major has been questioned by
Marks and Spencer over his friendship.
The pair have now moved on to separate branches, according to the
newspaper.
However, Ms Sue Sadler, head of corporate affairs for the company,
denied that he had been ''questioned by his bosses'' about the matter.
Ms Sadler said she had asked Mr Major personally about the allegations
because of questions being asked by journalists.
She added that Mr Major's move to Norwich was part of his training
programme and had been agreed before the allegations surfaced, as had
Mrs Jordache's promotion to a larger store in Leicester.
Mr Major, who has been living in the family home at Great Stukeley,
near Huntingdon, with his mother, Norma, is reportedly due to transfer
to Norwich on Monday.
Downing Street distanced itself from the story. A spokeswoman said:
''We've got no comment to make because this is a personal matter,
obviously.''
There was no reply from Mrs Jordache's home in Great Gransden,
Cambridgeshire.

TWO people died and five were injured in two road accidents in
Scotland at the weekend.
One man was killed and four others were seriously injured when their
car veered off a road, smashed through a fence, and somersaulted on to
its roof.
The car had been heading north on the A90 Laurencekirk-Aberdeen dual
carriageway yesterday when the accident happened just after 10am.
The crash happened on a straight stretch of road, just north of the
turn-off to Fordoun. The car was the only vehicle involved and the
weather conditions were good.
It is understood the occupants of the car, who are believed to be
young men, are all from the Aberdeen area. The four injured, including
the driver, were taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.
One lane of the dual carriageway was closed for around two hours.
The police are appealing for any witnesses to the accident and in
particular the driver of a heavy goods vehicle which was travelling
north,to contact them.
In the second incident, a man died when a car hit a wall on the
Bowden-Melrose road. He was named by police as Mr George Kiernan, 48, of
Tweedmount Road, Melrose.
The driver, Matthew Marshall, 21, of Falconer Rise, Livingston, was
treated in hospital and released.

THE Football Association of Ireland has refused to take part in a
police investigation into what sparked the Ireland-England soccer riot.
The refusal follows a disagreement between police and the football
authorities over how much information the FAI was given about known
British hooligans attending the Dublin match.
The FAI denies police allegations that information about troublemakers
had been passed on to the association.
Initially, the FAI agreed to co-operate with a joint inquiry, headed
by former Irish Chief Justice, Thomas Finlay. However, it later refused
to take part after taking legal advice.
FAI vice-president Michael Hyland said: ''We decided no interviews
would be given to the police until we concluded our business with the
official inquiry.''
More than 30 people were injured in the clashes which halted the
international after less than half an hour's play.
About the same number of English fans have appeared in Dublin courts
following the incident.

TORY in-fighting on the issue of a European single currency
intensified yesterday with former chancellor Norman Lamont returning to
the attack and senior backbencher Peter Fry warning the Prime Minister
to gag Chancellor Kenneth Clarke or face a leadership challenge.
Mr Lamont told Mr John Major the only way he could unite the party was
by leading a shift to a ''cautious, sceptical approach'' to Europe,
adding that he believed Britain already had yielded too much power to
Brussels.
By his remarks, coupled with a strongly worded speech on the matter on
Friday, Mr Lamont appears to be trying to place himself at the forefront
of the Euro-sceptics.
If Mr Major's predicament worsens, and there is open talk of a
leadership challenge to him this autumn, Mr Lamont could once again find
himself being spoken of as a serious ''stalking horse'' candidate.
On Friday, both Mr Major and Mr Clarke tried to brush off questions
about deep Cabinet divisions over Europe, and Mr Major is reported to
have read the riot act to senior Ministers, demanding they ''sing from
the same hymn sheet''.
He is in no position, however, to gag the likes of Mr Lamont, who
clearly still is bitter about his removal from office in 1993 after
Britain's pull-out from the European Monetary Union.
Mr Lamont told BBC TV's On the Record programme: ''It would be helpful
to the general debate on Europe if people were more open about their
objectives. Federalism, or a United States of Europe, is a policy that
dare not speak its name.
''There are politicians who believe that the sooner Westminster
becomes a county council the better. It would be better if people who
believed that said so.''
He claimed former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath, a strong
pro-European, was one MP who took that view but declined to name others.
Mr Lamont said the future of Europe was the ''supreme political issue
of our time'' and one which divided friends, families, and all political
parties.
He said it was impossible to avoid a ''great debate'' on it.
He added: ''The Chancellor said we were keeping our options open and
he spelled out, as he sees it, some of the advantages of going for a
single currency. I just happen to disagree with him.''
Mr Lamont backed Mr Major's vision of a Europe of nation states but
again called on him to take a firm grip on policy, particularly on the
single currency.
''You cannot for long take the line that whether Britain has the
freedom to issue its currency is something we will simply decide at a
later date. At some point, we have to confront the arguments as an issue
of principle,'' he said.
''The only way the Conservative Party can be truly united is to move
towards a cautious, sceptical approach towards Europe.''
Speaking on the same programme, Mr Fry said: ''Mr Clarke has a role to
play. If he wants to stay as Chancellor of the Exchequer and does not
want to have a disruptive leadership election in the autumn then perhaps
his real loyalty to the Prime Minister is to show a little discretion.''
''As we get nearer and nearer to the General Election, this basic
disagreement on Europe, unless it is resolved, could well lead to a lot
of people thinking in the autumn that there has got to be some change
somewhere.''
In another contribution to the debate yesterday, European Commission
vice-president Sir Leon Brittan swept aside Euro-sceptic fears,
insisting there were no plans to create a United States of Europe.
He insisted that even if Britain joined a single currency it would not
mean giving up control of economic policy and the Government still would
be able to set tax and spending levels.

Dyker John Cain had lived in the house in King's Road for many years.
He died a few weeks ago, aged 65.
The explosives were not thought to be in a dangerous condition but
police called the bomb squad and warned neighbours.
A Dumfries and Galloway and Galloway police spokesman said: ''We

A SENIOR police officer yesterday criticised demonstrators for their
''distasteful'' taunts over the death of Sir Nicholas Fairbairn.
The Assistant Chief Constable of Lothian and Borders, Mr Tom Wood, was
at a march of supporters of the Coalition Against the Criminal Justice
Bill in Duddingston.
In England, several protesters campaigning against the Bill were
arrested in the grounds of Windsor Castle.
The Lothian marchers were thwarted in their intention of taking over
the garden of Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind's home. Some chanted:
''Nicky, Nicky, Nicky, dead, dead, dead.''
Mr Wood said the protesters had in the main acted peacefully but
added: ''I do have to say I found references to the death of Nicholas
Fairbairn extremely distasteful, regardless of a man's politics. I think
that detracts a lot from what was happening here.''
The planned trespass was intended to illustrate how the new
legislation could deprive people of their freedom-to-roam rights.
However, as demonstrators marched through Holyrood Park, they found Mr
Rifkind's street blocked off by a wall of railings and police officers
at either end, with reinforcements in readiness in adjoining streets.
Mr Wood said the march, which was illegal because no application had
been made to Lothian region's transportation committee, would not have
been allowed to continue into Mr Rifkind's garden because that was
private property.
About 100 police officers were on duty as almost 150 marchers set off
from the Royal Commonwealth Pool to make their protest at the Minister's
home. It was selected as a target because of his share in the Cabinet's
collective responsibility for the legislation, one of the leaders said.
Despite chants of ''We want Malky'' and ''Malky, Malky, Malky, out,
out, out'' they were out of luck. Mr Rifkind and his family were not at
home over the weekend.
Afterwards, a small group broke away from the main body and six
arrests were made.
At Windsor Castle, the protesters were arrested after clashing with
police at the end of a march.
Mr Steve Platt, editor of the New Stateman and organiser of the march,
was among those taken away.
As he was led into a police van, he told reporters that he had been
arrested for obstruction and said: ''I have never seen an arrest for
something like this. It's ridiculous.''
The demonstration, along a one-and-a-half mile stretch of towpath used
exclusively by the royal family for more than a century, was largely
peaceful until it reached the end.
Minor scuffles began as police tried to shepherd the demonstrators
into waiting buses.
A police spokesman said 20 people were arrested for public order
offences. An exact figure would be disclosed later.
''In the main it was a peaceful demonstration but there were
disruptive elements and missiles were thrown at the police,'' he said.
''A small number broke away from the main group and tried to make
towards the castle but they were stopped and made to rejoin the
marchers.''
Police estimated that about 300 protesters took part and there were
400 officers on duty.
Mr Tim Davidson, Assistant Chief Constable of Thames Valley Police,
said: ''Our intention was to enable the demonstrators to make their
protest in a way which did not cause disorder and disruption.
''In the main, we were able to achieve that balance and the event was
peaceful.''
The march focused on the refusal of the Queen to allow public access
to the stretch of towpath. Ramblers want to see it incorporated in the
Thames-side walk which stretches 180 miles.
The Crown Estate Commissioners have maintained that allowing the
public to use the route would compromise royal security but they gave
permission for yesterday's march after ''negotiations'' with the police
-- making the demonstrators the first members of the public to walk the
route since Queen Victoria ordered it to be blocked in 1860.
However, to ensure that there is a continuous route along the Thames,
the Crown Estate Commissioners have reached agreement with the
Countryside Commission and Berkshire County Council to open a footpath
on the Datchet riverbank, on the opposite side of the river.
The Coalition Against the Criminal Justice Act had expected ordinary
walkers to join yesterday's march but the Ramblers' Association said its
members had decided not to take part.
Spokesman David Beskine said: ''The Ramblers' Association is not
involved with mass trespass by the coalition but can understand the
strong feelings which motivate ordinary people to defy authority when an
injustice is being dealt with.
''We are calling on the Crown Estates to open negotiations in order to
try and find a workable and reasonable compromise.
''We are convinced that the public can be allowed back on to this
attractive path while at the same time not creating any threat to the
security and privacy of the royal family.''

SENIOR Labour Party politicians expressed anger last night over a
newspaper article which alleged Mr Michael Foot was once regarded by the
KGB as an agent of influence who accepted Soviet money as a contribution
to the left-wing newspaper Tribune, which he then edited.
The former Labour leader has consulted lawyers. ''The headline that
appears in the Sunday Times is an absolute lie and I haven't spoken to
anybody yet who believes it,'' Mr Foot, 81, said.
The article alleges that the KGB had given Mr Foot the code-name Boot
and once held a two-volume file on him.
Among those critical of the front-page story, headed ''KGB: Michael
Foot was our agent'' was Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who
described it as a deliberate attempt to smear a politician who had done
an enormous amount for British democracy.
''Anyone who has met Michael knows he is a great democrat and a great
patriot,'' he said. ''The idea that Michael Foot would sell out his
country is absolute nonsense.''
It was, he said, a very sad example of the cheap and opportunistic
standards that had taken over some sections of the British press.
Even Mr John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times, did not believe
that Mr Foot had once been a spy for the Russians.
''The point is the KGB believed Michael Foot was an agent. That's how
they described him. That may be utter rubbish.''
Mr Foot does not deny that he had good relations with diplomats,
including some at the Soviet embassy.
''How these matters were reported back by the KGB, heaven knows,'' he
told the Sunday Times. ''Reputable English newspapers should be careful
not to be fooled by the Soviet secret police.''
The principal source of the allegations was double agent and KGB
defector Oleg Gordievsky. He said the article was an illustration of the
way the KGB had acted in the 1960s to the 1980s. It had not been his
objective to unmask anyone.
Throughout the period, it was well known that KGB generals were the
real masters of certain Soviet diplomats based in the UK.
They were anxious to court figures of influence, including trade union
leaders, Tory and Labour politicians, and journalists. Most suspected
that their congenial companion was a KGB colonel. Undoubtedly politics
was discussed but nothing that had not appeared in the British press.
Mr Ron Brown, former Labour MP for Leith, alleged to be a contact by
Mr Gordievsky, also attacked the report.
''There is nothing new in this,'' he said. ''It was well known that
Gordievsky met politicians and trade union leaders to speak about the
Soviet Union.''
The article claims that while Mr Foot was editor of Tribune, small
amounts of money -- no more than #150 at a time -- were donated through
intermediaries who could pose as benefactors of the publication.
Mr Witherow said the newspaper was not alleging that Mr Foot had done
anything illegal. ''We're saying that he was in contact with the
Russians as diplomats, as he would have seen them, and he was taking
payments on behalf of the Tribune newspaper,'' he added.
However, Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath and chairman of the board
of Tribune, said: ''This is just McCarthyite tittle tattle.
''Given that Tribune's stance was unambiguously anti-Stalinist, it
just seems an extraordinary allegation. Michael has had a long
association with the paper and we're proud to have him as an active and
loved member of the board.''
The current editor, Mr Mark Seddon, said: ''Not to anybody's knowledge
at Tribune has the paper via Michael Foot ever taken money from the
Soviet Union.
''We'll be taking legal advice.''
Mr Neil Kinnock, who succeeded Mr Foot as Labour leader, said: ''These
claims are absurd and offensive and the complete opposite of the truth,
as anyone who knows Michael's record in fighting for democracy can
testify.''

A MAN is being hunted after a ''motiveless'' attack in which two
customers were stabbed in a bookmaker's shop.
The two, who have not been named, were placing bets in Coral's,
Raploch Street, Larkhall, when the incident happened.
Police say a man came in and plunged a knife into both of them before
running off.
Staff at the shop raised the alarm.
One of the customers, aged 24, needed surgery at Law Hospital. The
knife cut into his liver. The other, aged 16, had stitches for a wound
to his back.
CID in Hamilton said: ''We can find no reason for this attack.''

COLLEAGUES, political and legal, and opponents in the careers of the
flamboyant Sir Nicholas Fairbairn last night paid tribute to a man whose
death they said has left the world a greyer place.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang led the tributes from Conservative
colleagues, whom Sir Nicholas was capable of grievously insulting as
well as delighting with his wit.
Mr Lang said: ''I was deeply saddened to learn of Nicky's death. He
was dedicated to Parliament, to democracy, to the welfare of his
constituents in Perth and Kinross, and to the beliefs of the
Conservative and Unionist Party. All in Scottish political life will
mourn his loss.
''He lived life to the full, with verve and passion, and his interests
and talents ran much wider than politics. He was a brilliant advocate, a
gifted painter, and a sparkling after dinner speaker who, in his day,
made some of the finest and funniest speeches heard in Parliament.
''All of us will want to offer our deepest sympathy to his wife, Sam,
and to his three daughters.''
Sir Nicholas's constituency chairman, Mr Martin Robb, said: ''On
behalf of the Perth and Kinross Association, I wish to express our deep
sympathy to Nicky's family and pay tribute to the outstanding political
contribution that he has made over the last 22 years.''
Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party, spoke
of the affection of Sir Nicholas for Scotland. ''Above all, he was a
true Scottish patriot. He loved his native Scotland, he loved its verse
and language, and he was kenspeckled in his Scottish dress.
''Behind his wit and trenchant comments, there lay a man who was
passionate in seeking justice and fairness for everyone.''
Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said in many ways
Sir Nicholas ''became detached from his own party and occasionally
seemed to become detached from reality, but he certainly stood out.
''He will be remembered for some lapses in judgment and taste but also
for moments of brilliance and insight.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said: ''Nicky was a man of wit and style, who
brought colour and humour to Scottish politics. He had a strong sense of
public service and his decisive contribution to the affairs of Scotland
will be missed.''
Mr Jim Wallace, Scottish leader of the Liberal Democrats, said: ''The
House of Commons has lost one of its most flamboyant and individualistic
characters.''
Legal colleagues last night also paid tribute to Sir Nicholas, who
established a brilliant reputation as a defence advocate.
Solicitor Mr Joseph Beltrami, who enjoyed a personal and professional
relationship with Sir Nicholas spanning 40 years, said the advocate's
passing had left him shocked and bereft.
He added: ''We worked together from 1956 on some of the most serious
criminal trials in Scotland's history. Nicky had wit, cheek, excellent
command of the language, and, what's not generally known, an excellent
knowledge of anatomy due to his medical studies which really gave him an
edge in murder trials.''
The occasional butt of Sir Nicholas's humour, Scotland's senior judge
Lord Hope, the Lord Justice General, told BBC Radio Scotland yesterday
that Sir Nicholas had been an excellent ''jury advocate''.

CHARLES Gordon, transport chairman for Strathclyde Regional Council,
has succeeded in his second bid to become a prospective Labour candidate
for the new Glasgow unitary authority elections to be held in April.
Mr Gordon lost Blairdardie ward last month by seven votes to six to
22-year-old Steven Purcell, secretary of the City of Glasgow District
Labour Party.
He then turned his sights on the Knightswood Park ward which he won
last night by 15 votes to 12.
His opponent, district councillor William Butler, is known as a strong
supporter of former Glasgow Labour leader Jean McFadden.
Mr Gordon believed he took some of the fallout from the long-running
feud between supporters of Councillor McFadden and those of the current
Labour leader Patrick Lally when he lost in Blairdardie.
He had apparently made it known that, as a regional councillor, he
wanted no part of the McFadden-Lally feud.
Mr Gordon said last night: ''I feel I was stabbed in the back at
Blairdardie but the grass roots working-class people of Knightswood Park
have given me a tremendous boost.''
Reflecting on the City Chambers feud, he stated: ''The new Glasgow
unitary authority must start with a clean sheet.
''I think the people of Glasgow are thoroughly fed up with the feuding
and fighting.
''What they want is a stable and hard-working administration and I
hope to be part of that.''

AN ANGLER drowned and another is missing presumed drowned after their
16ft dinghy capsized on Loch Lomond at the weekend. The missing man is
the father of four children, three of them triplets aged nine.
The anglers, Mr Billy Ballantyne, whose body has been recovered, and
Mr Alistair McQuilkie, both members of the Vale of Leven Angling Club at
Fisherwood, Balloch, had gone fishing on Saturday morning.
Club member Jim McNiven said last night: ''Five boats went out from
here on Saturday morning. I was in one of them.
''We saw Billy and Alistair round about midday and I asked them if
they would come in for a cup of tea, but they said no. They would carry
on.''
However, conditions in the afternoon deteriorated rapidly as the loch
was battered by strong southerly winds.
Mr McNiven, an ex-policeman, added: ''It was a devil of a day, very
stormy with high winds and rain. We scurried home, thinking they were
following us, but they never returned and we raised the alarm.''
A search was mounted involving Central Scotland Police underwater
search unit, Luss rescue boat and helicopters from Strathclyde Police,
and the search and rescue service from Pitreavie.
The missing men's dinghy was discovered at about midday yesterday
empty and capsized near Luss on the west side of the loch.
A few hours later, the Luss rescue boat crew recovered the body of Mr
Ballantyne from the loch near Balmaha on the eastern shore. An engineer
at Vale of Leven Hospital, Alexandria, Mr Ballantyne was married and
lived at Colquhoun Drive, Rosshead, Alexandria.
The rescue boat then resumed the search for Mr McQuilkie, of Woodside
Crescent, Bonhill, as darkness began to fall last night.
Mr McNiven said: ''This is a terrible tragedy. Nothing like this has
ever happened to our club before.
''People are gathering here at the club. There is a great deal of
sorrow. We are stunned. Our hearts go out to the loved ones of these
men.''
The search will resume at first light today.
* Four teenagers drowned when their car plunged into a canal.
A fifth, Katrina Josephs, 16, had been sitting in the back seat of the
Ford Escort and was thrown clear through the rear window before the car
plunged into the Oxford Canal, near Banbury, Oxfordshire, early
yesterday.
Police said her cries for help woke up a couple living nearby but she
was not found for about an hour after the accident.
She was taken to hospital in Banbury with neck, back, and leg
injuries, and severe hypothermia. Her condition was described as
''fair''.
Mr Richard Wheeler, 18, Carmen Maguire, 17, Mia Sabin, 16, and Fiona
Caine, 15, all from Banbury, were found in the overturned car.
* An air and sea search for a man missing after a party of canoeists
ran into a sudden storm off the Irish coast was scaled down last night.
The body of a 14-year-old boy, who had been missing after the trip near
the seaside village of Dunmore East, County Waterford, was recovered
from the sea early yesterday. Six other canoeists survived.

<HEADLINE>Herald radioactive pollution revelations provoke party call for action Greens threaten Dounreay arrest</HEADLINE>

THE Highland Green Party is threatening to make a citizen's arrest of
Dounreay director John Baxter if nothing is done by the authorities
about the plant, which The Herald revealed last week has been
discharging radioactive nitric acid into the sea illegally.
The party held an emergency meeting in Inverness and has said it will
give the authorities a week to do something about what appears to be a
clear breach of the 1985 Control of Pollution Act, which contains a
maximum penalty of a #20,000 fine and three months in prison.
Dounreay uses the acids to dissolve spent nucelar fuel rods containing
uranium and plutonium in its reprocessing plant. It has been making the
discharges since it began reprocessing more than 35 years ago but did
not mention them when applying to the Highland River Purification Board
for discharge consents under the new Act in 1985. The discharges are
still being made.
The party's spokesman on nuclear issues, former parliamentary
candidate John Martin, told The Herald yesterday that reprocessing would
have to be stopped until Dounreay had built a neutralisation plant to
deal with the acids. Dounreay's operator, the Atomic Energy Authority,
had to accept that it was not above the law.
''We are writing to the procurator-fiscal in Wick asking him to pursue
the matter with the utmost vigour. We are calling for a police
investigation into the plant's original application for consent.''
He said the party was also calling on Mr Duncan McPherson, convener of
Highland Regional Council, to convene an emergency meeting of Dounreay
Liaison Committee to discuss Dounreay's ''enormous breach of trust''.
''This amounts to nothing less than a daily criminal act which carries
a clear and severe penalty under our law. We cannot sit back and allow
this digraceful and poisonous activity to continue when it not only
constitutes a crime against the environment but is also clearly
prohibited by our criminal code.
''Should no action be forthcoming by the end of this week, we reserve
the right to take action ourselves by whatever legal means open to us,
including a citizen's arrest of Dounreay's director and the use of the
courts to force a closure of the reprocessing plant.''
Yesterday, the AEA spokesman at Dounreay, Mr Ian Shepherd, responded
to the Highland Green Party's statement:
''I think it should be stressed that the present director Mr Baxter
has been in post for less than a year but, in that time, top priority
has been given to addressing the situation of 40 years of nuclear
development at the site. He has initiated a number of programmes to that
end.''
The discharges are quickly neutralised by seawater. However, Mr
Shepherd said the AEA has been in discussion with the Highland River
Purification Board for some time as to how best to neutralise the
discharges before entering the sea: ''But it is not something that can
be done in five minutes.''
* BRITISH Nuclear Fuels goes to court in France today in a bid to
prevent Greenpeace activists interfering with a ship carrying nuclear
waste from Cherbourg to Japan.
The company will ask for an injunction to stop the environmental
protesters approaching within five nautical miles of the British-owned
ship and its cargo of vitrified waste, the first such shipment to be
made.
Environmental group Greenpeace has its ship, Moby Dick, in dock at
Cherbourg watching out for the delivery of the waste, from the La Hague
reprocessing plant. The nuclear cargo is due to sail on Wednesday.

Dublin
THE Irish Government will promise to remove any territorial claim to
Northern Ireland when both Prime Ministers meet in Belfast on Wednesday.
The pledge is in the 25-page framework document completed on Saturday
by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish Deputy Prime Minister, and Sir Patrick
Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary.
Both Cabinets will vet the document before Wednesday.
Last night, diplomatic sources in Dublin indicated that Belfast was
the most likely venue for a summit, because both Governments believe
that public opinion there is less hostile to political progress than the
leaderships of the two main Unionist parties. They have rejected the
document outright before its publication.
In addition to appealing over the heads of the Unionists parties, Mr
Major is said to be anxious to announce in Belfast his Government's own
separate proposals for an 85-member assembly at Stormont.
On Irish radio yesterday, Mr Spring said he would look with interest
at the alternative document which Unionists have threatened to publish.
Insisting that the Irish Government was prepared to sit down with all
parties, Mr Spring said any document which had a contribution to the
talks process would be welcome.
In an attempt to allay Unionist fears of a sell-out to a united
Ireland, the Irish Government will confirm an explicit undertaking in
the joint framework document to remove from its constitution any real or
imagined threat to the territorial integrity of Northern Ireland.
However, the specific form of wording which would be put to voters in
a referendum would be a matter for later on, once all-party round-table
talks were under way.
British Ministers have gone out of their way to assure the Unionists
that they have nothing to fear from the proposals, and that they are not
the start of any ''slippery slope''. A report that Dublin would be given
a formal role in a radical reshaping of the Royal Ulster Constabulary
was heavily played down by the Northern Ireland Office yesterday.
The Unionists, however, remain suspicious and have made clear that
they will not be forced into a corner. They have stopped short of
threatening total withdrawal of co-operation with the Government, but
will seek to persuade Ministers that they are going in the wrong
direction.
The Upper Bann MP, Mr David Trimble, told GMTV's Sunday Programme that
the Prime Minister now appeared to want to rescue the process from
''disaster'', but he renewed the warning that the indication was that
there was nothing for Unionists in a framework document which ''set out
to meet the minimum demands of the Provisional IRA for the continuance
of their ceasefire''.
He added: ''The Irish Government regard it as prescriptive and the
document, as I understand it, is very tightly drawn and doesn't give
much scope for any future discussions. It is just a take-it-or-leave-it
exercise.
Later, Mr Trimble said the Government's approach to the Unionists was
''all stick and no carrot''.
He said Unionists would not discuss a document which set up
all-Ireland bodies but would be happy to talk to the Government about a
series of ''novel approaches'' to finding a solution that they would
soon put forward. ''If the framework document appears to us to be a cage
containing proposals we consider to be hostile to the Union then we
can't go into it,'' he said.
Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux described the forthcoming
document as being ''over the dam''. He had spent the last 10 years
trying to heal the wounds in Northern Ireland. ''Here along come these
draughtsmen of this new framework, armed with a fistful of rusty needles
which are going to reopen wounds.''

A BIRTHDAY treat turned into tragedy when a 33-year-old mother died of
a heart attack just hours after her car struck and killed a man who was
walking along the M8.
Both Mrs Hazel Black and her daughter Kimberley, 14, were being
treated for shock in Monklands District General Hospital after the crash
when Mrs Black suffered the attack.
Doctors tried for more than an hour to stabilise her but she died
early yesterday. It is believed the heart attack could have been brought
on by head and neck injuries sustained in the crash.
The pedestrian who died was 50-year-old Mr John Gillies, of Fir View,
Calderbank, Airdrie. The force of the impact, which took place around
10.45pm on Saturday night, drove Mr Gillies's body through the
windscreen where he struck Mrs Black in the face, causing glass cuts.
Minutes before the accident, which took place near the Harthill
service station, Lothian and Borders Police received a warning call that
a man was walking along the motorway. Police at the traffic department
in Motherwell are asking for witnesses to the accident to contact them.
Speaking in his home at The Esplanade, Greenock, Mrs Black's husband,
John, said his wife and daughter were returning from a trip to see the
musical, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, in Edinburgh.
''It was my daughter's fourteenth birthday today and they had
travelled through to Edinburgh for a shopping trip followed by the show.
It's a birthday she'll never be able to forget.''
He explained that his wife, still dazed and shocked from the crash,
had called home by mobile phone from the scene of the accident.
When she could not get through, she contacted her sister, who lives in
the house above, who sent Mr Black's niece to tell him.
Upon hearing the news, he immediately phoned his wife at the scene.
''She said, 'the whole windscreen is out and I've got glass in my eye'.
I then asked if the ambulance and police had arrived, they hadn't yet
but another motorist had phoned them.''
After reassuring Kimberley, he headed to the scene but was contacted
by phone and told to go to Monklands District General Hospital, where
his wife and daughter were being treated for shock.
''I went up there thinking I'd be able to collect them. I met
Kimberley, who was with a nurse in casualty and was then told my wife
was in intensive care.
''The doctors did everything they could to save her. They had a
surgeon standing by ready to operate if they had managed to stabilise
her heart but they couldn't.''
Mr Black said a doctor explained that her neck or brain could have
been injured by the impact of the crash and the force of Mr Gillies's
body through the windscreen, which may have brought on the heart attack.
The couple have four children Kimberley 14, Samantha 12, Caroline,
nine, and four-year-old Scott.
Mrs Black's parents, Ernest and Myria Freedman, have been informed. Mr
Black said: ''They are now going through what was, before this, my worst
nightmare, which is losing a child.''
He also said: ''I would also like to express my gratitude to the staff
of Monklands Hospital for doing everything they possibly could.''

AS blizzards sweep the Scottish mountains and the swift hand of
avalanche strikes at the unwary, rescue teams are out in force once
more, risking life and limb for the sake of those who fail to heed the
warnings.
Public understanding for those who seek inspiration on proud peaks --
and sympathy for those who fall victim -- quickly changes to impatience
when you realise last weekend was no time for high-scaling adventure.
Of course, climbers arriving from all over Britain naturally wish to
make the most of their brief visit. But why are they so inclined to
ignore the warnings? The police and weather forecasters left no doubt
that avalanches were a distinct danger.
That warning was duly heeded by people like Mr Tom Weir, the veteran
climber who has explored the mountains of Scotland and far beyond for
more than 60 years and is alive to tell the tale because of his respect
for the elements.
''I was all set to climb but I read the forecast and knew there was a
high risk of avalanche,'' he told me yesterday from his home at
Gartocharn, near Loch Lomond. ''So I abandoned the plans.
''People don't pay nearly enough attention to the weather. And they
don't start out early enough in the day. The essence of safety in
Scotland, with its changeable weather, is to make that early start so
that you can decide in good time about when to pull out.
''It is also true that winter climbing has become something of a
fetish. It used to be that not too many people did it. The mountains
have become no less savage but, with modern equipment, you will find
people going up Ben Nevis carrying 300ft of climbing rope and 20lb of
gear, plus food.
''It's a fetish for difficulty. There is also a kind of pub culture
with its competitive element. I have heard a fellow saying: 'You don't
mean to say you took the ordinary route?' ''
The reason so many people were getting into trouble on the Scottish
mountains, he said, was that the lessons of experience were not being
learned by those who had not yet been in trouble themselves. It takes
just one moment of imbalance to seal your fate.
In a long lifetime of climbing the mountains of the world, he has
escaped with just two accidents. As Edmund Hillary was heading for his
conquest of Everest in 1953, Mr Weir had just returned from the
Himalayas -- in time to dice with death when an avalanche near Bridge of
Orchy swept him into a 600ft drop. He remembers the dream sequence of
seeing himself falling.
It was in that same area in 1933 that his inexperience as a teenager
led him into the foolhardiness of seeking the summit of Beinn Dorain in
a howling gale. He and his companion were forced to their knees for the
final assault and after descending to 1000ft they were still being blown
around like drunk men.
Even back in Glasgow, they could have gauged the unsuitable nature of
the weather. For that was the day the famous old Tramway Clock in Bath
Street, a landmark in the city centre, was blown down in gusts of over
100mph.

A NINE-YEAR-OLD girl whose life was controlled by epilepsy has not had
a seizure since November after undergoing pioneering treatment.
Before the treatment, Emily McGugan suffered as many as two major
seizures a day.
However, doctors have tracked down the cause of the illness and
operated to cure it.
Emily's father Brian, 38, said that, before the treatment, he and his
wife Sheila, 36, were often called to Kirn Primary School, Dunoon, to
collect Emily after an attack.
''But she was so determined to stay in class that she would insist on
returning after a couple of hours,'' said Mr McGugan, a financial
consultant.
''An hour later, we would be called again because of another seizure.
For four years, Emily's life was ruled by epilepsy and drug treatment
was unsuccessful.''
Hope for Emily, of Clyde Street, Kirn, Dunoon, came from treatment
being carried out at Southern General hospital, Glasgow, where a team,
led by consultant neurologist Dr Rod Duncan and neurosurgeon Mr Ken
Lindsay, is using a new way of locating the exact site of epilepsy in
the brain.
With the latest MRI scans, the team detect the small lesions,
responsible for seizures, which were previously invisible to scanning
techniques.
The surgeon is then able to operate to remove the affected part of the
brain, usually around two or three cms in size, without any lasting
damage to the patient.
Since her surgery in November, Emily has been free of epilepsy. ''We
are just hoping and praying that it will be a permanent cure,'' said Mrs
McGugan.
Mr McGugan summed up his feelings by saying: ''I feel a tremendous
burden has been lifted from us.
''Before, we could not let her out our sight. Even a bike ride on the
pavement had to be supervised in case she fell off during a seizure.''
Dr Duncan believes the new approach to detecting the site of epilepsy
in the brain offers hope to many others.
''We are successfully treating people whose lives would otherwise be
wrecked by the condition.
''Previous techniques could detect a cause for between 10% and 20%. We
expect this to increase to 50% with this new scanning technique.
Both adults and children are benefiting but Dr Duncan stresses the
younger patient has greater success.
''We are delighted with Emily's progress, particularly since her cause
of epilepsy -- a calcification in the brain -- would not have been
previously detected.''

A SKIER was still missing early today more than 36 hours after he was
last seen on the blizzard-hit mountains in Glenshee. At least one
climber was also missing elsewhere in the Scottish hills last night at
the end of a hectic weekend for rescue teams.
About 100 people will resume the search of the Cairnwell area near
Braemar for experienced cross-country skier Mr Andrew Wilson at first
light today, but rescue team leaders are growing increasingly concerned.
Mr Wilson, 40, of Croftfoot, Glasgow, was last seen on Saturday at
lunchtime. He and a skiing companion set out that morning but it is
understood his friend decided the route was beyond his capabilities and
took a short cut back to their car. The pair had spent the past week
with a ski school in Braemar.
The alarm was raised on Saturday evening when Mr Wilson had still not
returned to the car. Rescue teams searched until 2am yesterday when
worsening weather forced them to stop. The search resumed yesterday
morning but high winds and heavy snow again hampered the operation.
''One minute you can not see further ahead than two or three yards,
then suddenly you can see the whole hill,'' said Sergeant Graham Gibb,
of Grampian Police Mountain Rescue Team, who is co-ordinating the
search. ''It is very hard going.''
Mr Wilson is known to have been well equipped and Sergeant Gibb is
hopeful he may still be found alive. ''As time goes on, you do worry for
his safety but if he is on the lee side of the hill and if he is in a
bivvy bag, then he may be all right.''
Speaking at the semi-detached house Mr Wilson shares with his wife,
Marion, in Crofton Avenue, Croftfoot, a family spokesman said: ''We are
praying for the best but preparing for the worst.''
Both Mr Wilson, a cashier with a Glasgow wholesale plumbers, and his
civil servant wife are keep-fit enthusiasts who regularly ski
cross-country.
Eight thousand skiers braved high winds at the three areas open
yesterday. Nevis Range, on Aonach Mor, near Fort William, and White
Corries in Glencoe were stormbound but at Glenshee, there were 3500
skiers on the pistes. The upper slopes at Cairngorm, near Aviemore, were
closed with almost 3000 people on the lower runs. Winds were lighter at
The Lecht which had 1500 skiers.
Meanwhile, a search continued yesterday for a climber who was reported
to have fallen through a snow cornice while descending Ben Nevis on
Saturday.
The search, involving the Lochaber and RAF Kinloss mountain rescue
teams and a helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth, was scaled down at
lunchtime yesterday.
Lochaber team leader Mr Terry Confield said: ''With the very poor
visibility and the amount of fresh snow which fell overnight, the
hopelessness of the situation is such that I feel there is no way we can
find that climber today.''
A climber caught in an avalanche in Glen Etive, Argyll, was yesterday
found safe and well after an overnight ordeal.
Mr Alan Dryden had been climbing with a companion near the summit of
Glas Beinn Mhor on Saturday afternoon, when both were swept down the
hillside. Although unable to see him in the snow, his friend was able to
make voice contact with him and then made his way down the mountain to
raise the alarm.
Rescue teams searched the area until 3am yesterday when worsening
weather forced them to stand down. However, 50 members of the Glencoe,
Arrochar, RAF Leuchars, Strathclyde Police, and Northern Constabulary
mountain rescue teams resumed the search at first light.
The missing climber was finally located mid-morning, near to where he
had last been seen. Mr Dryden, 47, a Customs officer from Dunfermline,
was not seriously injured and was able to walk off the mountain with the
help of rescuers.
Earlier in the weekend, the Lochaber team rescued two climbers who
fell on Creag Meagaidh near Laggan.
Mr Ewen Fraser, 29, of Eglinton Street, Beith, Ayrshire, and Mr Ian
Barnett, 31, of the Doctors' Residence, Law Hospital, Carluke,
Lanarkshire, slipped 200ft down the mountain on Saturday.
The pair, who had head and leg injuries and were suffering from
hypothermia, were taken to hospital at Fort William and later
transferred to Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
Police yesterday issued a reminder to climbers and walkers in the
Cairngorm, Ben Nevis, and Glencoe areas that there was still a high risk
of avalanches risk and said they should check information before setting
out.

IF one rates clinical neuropsychology, a natural tendency towards
happiness is unlikely.
One practitioner, Dr David Weeks at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, thinks
the happiest people are the eccentrics and has taken the trouble to
write a book to that effect.
He conducted a 10-year study into eccentrics in Britain and North
America, and discovered that the condition interrelated with
intelligence, generally favourably.
He believes all people have an eccentric streak, and that it is
conducive to good health to indulge in the instinct to be different. In
fact, it is vital, he says, to most creative activity and original
scientific thought.
Benjamin Franklin, William Blake, James Joyce, Charlie Chaplin, and
Albert Einstein were eccentrics. Eccentrics, who are highly intelligent
in novel and unusual ways, also tend to be eldest or only children.
The research threw up the fact that they consulted doctors only about
one twentieth as often as the general population.
Dr Weeks said he believed there was a neuro-chemical explanation for
this, in that eccentrics were not worried about conforming and were less
likely to feel stressed. Because of their humour and happiness, they
also tended to live longer. They found immense pleasure and stimulation
in their way of life.
Eccentrics, by David Weeks and Jamie James, is published on Thursday
by Weidenfeld and Nicolson, price #17.99.

A CHARTERED accountant, Mr Michael Moore, 29, has been chosen by the
Liberal Democrats to fight the Borders seat held by former party leader
Sir David Steel, who is standing down at the next General Election.
Mr Moore, who works for Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Edinburgh, was chosen as
prospective candidate in the Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale seat
after a postal ballot of local party members. There were four other
candidates.
Sir David, who is being tipped to be given a seat in the House of
Lords, described Mr Moore as an ''exciting choice''.
The new candidate is a former pupil of Jedburgh Grammar School and
graduated from Edinburgh University. He then spent two years working as
a research assistant with Mr Archy Kirkwood, the Liberal Democrat MP in
the neighbouring constituency.
Sir David's majority at the last election was just over 2500, with the
Conservative candidate in second place. However, the constituency
boundaries have been redrawn making an exact comparison difficult.
Although Mr Moore is young and has never fought a parlaimentary
election before, the Lib Dems will argue that is not a stumbling block,
pointing out that their MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, Mr Charles
Kennedy, was one of the youngest MPs ever to be elected to the Commons.

THE death of Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, the singular Tory MP for Perth
and Kinross, has handed the Government a fresh political crisis, with a
by-election expected to be held in the highly marginal seat on April 6.
There were tributes to the self-styled bon viveur and wit yesterday
from across the political spectrum, with friend and foe alike agreeing
that Scotland and Westminister will be greyer places for the absence of
the brilliant orator whose legal and political careers peaked as
Solicitor-General between 1979 and 1982.
After a long struggle against liver disease, he died at Queen
Margaret's Hospital in Dunfermline, near his home at Fordell Castle. At
his side was his second wife Suzanne, affectionately known as Lady Sam,
and other members of his family.
Never one to shun controversy, Sir Nicholas gave a remarkable
interview to The Herald earlier this month in which he said his
successor had ''not a chance'' of holding on to the seat, which he had
announced he was stepping down from in any event at the next General
Election.
Announcing his retirement last year Sir Nicholas, the flamboyant
dresser, railed against the colourless party clones taking over
politics. It was a theme he followed up on in claiming this month that
his successor, London-based merchant banker John Godfrey, was one such
grey man. Mr Godfrey harboured no resentment over the remarks and said
yesterday: ''I learned with sadness about Nicky's death today. He will
be much missed.''
The Scottish Secretary, Mr Ian Lang, said: ''He was dedicated to
Parliament, to democracy, to the welfare of his constituents in Perth
and Kinross and to the beliefs of the Conservative and Unionist Party.
All in Scottish political life will mourn his loss.''
Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George Robertson, said: ''He
was a very colourful character who left his mark on Scottish politics.
In many ways he became detached from his own party and occasionally
seemed to become detached from reality, but he certainly stood out.''
While senior politicans paid their tributes to Sir Nicholas and
avoided any public comment about the impending by-election, party
strategists were already contemplating what will be a fascinating
campaign strewn with pitfalls for the Government.
Defeat in the by-election is regarded as almost inevitable, which is
the main reason why it is believed that the date chosen will be April 6,
the same day as local government elections for the new single-tier
authorities in Scotland.
The effect of choosing that date would be two-fold. A defeat would be
buried in the general publicity over the local election results, and the
hustings for the single-tier poll would drain political energy and make
it harder for the likes of the SNP to swamp the constituency with
activists, as they would normally do for a Westminster by-election.
Another outside possibility would be to delay naming a date and then
opt for May 5, the date of local elections south of the Border, but this
is thought unlikely.
Even without Sir Nicholas's disparaging comments about his successor,
Tories faced an uphill struggle in the constituency, which was held with
a majority of just over 2000, or 4.2%, in the face of a concerted SNP
attack in the 1992 General Election. At last year's regional council
elections not a single Tayside ward within the Perth and Kinross
district returned a Conservative and the SNP were the clear victors.
Although no-one is admitting it in senior Tory circles, the party's
best strategy may well be to play a longer game, write-off the
by-election, and hope to win the constituency back at a future General
Election, which is what they achieved last time at Kincardine and
Deeside after losing out to the Scottish Liberal Democrats in a previous
mid-term by-election.
Glasgow advocate Roseanna Cunningham ran Sir Nicholas close last time
but there are no indications yet whether she would like to fight the
seat again for the SNP. Other names mentioned privately as contenders
are the party's national secretary, Mr Alasdair Morgan, and the leader
on Perth and Kinross District, Councillor Bruce Crawford.
However, SNP strategists are known to be concerned about their
unaccustomed entry into the fray as front-runners, rather than
underdogs, and will have to plan accordingly. They admitted privately
yesterday that election victory cannot be taken for granted, believing
that the MP's controversial style may have alienated thousands of
natural Tory supporters in the rural constituency.
