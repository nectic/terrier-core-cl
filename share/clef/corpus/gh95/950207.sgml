Hamilton Accies 1, Rangers 3
THERE was never much danger of a shock to follow the fact that Rangers
had been given the news that striker Ally McCoist, who had hoped to lead
his team's front line in last night's Scottish Cup tie, would be out for
between four and six weeks after having his left ankle encased in
plaster.
But Hamilton Accies let no one down at Firhill with a spirited,
willing, and at times skilful challenge to the country's champions.
Rangers went through to a meeting with either Clydebank or Hearts
comfortably enough but they came off the heavily-sanded Firhill pitch
aware they had been in a match.
In fact, had it not been for a couple of fine saves by Ally Maxwell
and a brilliant interception by Basile Boli, Accies might have caused a
few hearts to flutter in the second half.
By then Rangers were two ahead, from goals scored by Trevor Steven,
his first for a year, and Boli.
Maybe they were entitled to come down the gears after the break, at
least subconsciously, but the consequence was that the premier side went
through some hairy moments before Brian Laudrup scored the third goal.
That was maybe just as well because only a few minutes later Hamilton's
admirable industry earned its pay-off when substitute David Lorimer
scored.
Rangers might have given themselves a head start if Accies keeper
Allan Ferguson had not been on full alert from the off. He produced a
fine save inside five minutes when he stretched to touch away a
well-struck Durie shot.
Craig Moore gave solid evidence that he and his mates were ready for
the fray with a robust tackle on Peter Duffield, for which he was
booked.
Rangers went ahead in due course after 20 minutes when Steven,
starting only his third game of the season, scored a splendid goal.
Stuart McCall did the hard work, chasing a ball others would have let
run away, and when he touched it over to Durie, his knock back went to
Steven. The midfield man delivered a precise chip over Ferguson into the
net.
Only four minutes more had passed when Rangers added their second,
produced and finished by Basil Boli.
The French defender sent the ball out to Moore on the right and
continued his run from close to the halfway line into the penalty area
where the Accies defence obligingly cleared a path for him to run on to
Moore's return pass and steer it away from the keeper. Basile was then
booked for overdoing the celebration
If everybody assumed that second goal answered the main question of
the night, who was going into the next round, Hamilton were at least
determined to try to climb back into the contest. They came close, too,
with a Paul Chalmers header which brought out a fine save from Ally
Maxwell.
Rangers threatened to add a few more before the interval, but Accies
were still trying as hard as ever. Sean McEntegart tried a trifle too
hard and was booked.
Hamilton, who put on David Lorimer for Raymond McStay at the start of
the second half, came out full of energy and caused Rangers serious
problems.
Rangers then struck with their third goal. A long clearance by Maxwell
was knocked on by McCall to Laudrup and the Dane calmly lifted the ball
over the keeper into the net for his ninth goal of the season. Then
Durie was booked for a reckless challenge on McQuade.
In 63 minutes, Accies tried their second substitution, Crawford Baptie
replacing McQuade who had been injured in a collision with Durie.
They refused to capitulate, and in 66 minutes, they were rewarded with
a goal by substitute Lorimer
HAMILTON -- Ferguson, Renicks, Hillcoat, McEntegart, McCall, McIntosh,
Clark, McStay, Chalmers, Duffield, McQuade. Substitutes -- Baptie,
Lorimer, Cormack.
RANGERS -- Maxwell, Moore, Robertson, Gough, Boli, McCall, Steven,
Miller, Durie, Hateley, Laudrup. Substitutes -- Brown, Durrant, Scott.
Referee -- W Crombie (Edinburgh).

GLASGOW-based Scottish Mutual, the life office arm of the Abbey
National bank, has made a substantial move into the growing healthcare
market with the group's acquisition for #8.3m of Pegasus, a market
leader in critical illness -- sometimes called dread disease --
products. The Pegasus product range also includes healthcare and life
policies.
It has over 20,000 poicyholders and has more than 20% of the
Independent Financial Adviser critical illness market.
Critical illness cover, which originated in South Africa, is
relatively new to this country having been introduced in 1986. Basically
it is designed to provide a lump sum should a policyholder be diagnosed
as having any one of a range of critical conditions or have to undergo
certain types of major surgery.
In the critical illness market, some 31 illnesses in varying
combinations are proved by companies, some of whom cover children on
parents policies. Aids is not covered.
Pegasus, which began trading in 1989 and has offices in Bristol,
London and Manchester, will form a new health care division within
Scottish Mutual and the wider group.
Scottish Mutual has funds under management in excess of #4000m and
over 1000 staff in the Glasgow Head Office and 12 area offices
nationwide. It focuses on pensions and investment markets and has 4% of
the total IFA market.
Commenting on the deal, Andrew Pople, Scottish Mutual's chief
executive, said ''This strategic move into the healthcare market --
using the skills of an award-winning market leader to enter a young and
fast-growing industry -- will provide longer term growth opportunities
for Scottish Mutual.''

THE increasing level of competition in the fund industry was
underlined yesterday when Henderson Administration warned that the
results for the year to March will be below the #20.3m achieved last
year, sending shares tumbling 62p to 1013p.
Henderson said that significant client losses had continued in a key
element of its business.
At the interim stage to September, while group pre-tax profits
increased 22% to #11.2m, pension funds under management had declined
during the previous six months by 10.5% to #4701m.
Even then, Henderson was expressing great concern and, in November,
had recruited Dugald Eadie as managing director of Henderson Pension
Fund Management.
But as the UK equity market overall has shown little change in the
last four months on fairly low volume, there have been few opportunities
to take short-term profits.
A spokesman said that client loss had been caused by under-performance
and polarisation in the industry, with pension funds moving towards the
industry giants such as Mercury Asset Management and Schroders.
There was also movement towards the high-performance managers such as
Newton Investments. The consolation is that the retail and international
business areas have continued to grow.
Analysts are looking for a profits outcome for the year of around
#18.5m, and it is intended to maintain the dividend total at 44p.
Inevitably, there must be doubts about Henderson's survival as an
independent entity, even if it was itself on the acquisition trail less
than three years ago, when it took over the Touche Ross unit trusts.

ALBERTO Tomba, the Italian skier who has been to hot to handle for his
opponents on the ski slopes of Europe so far this season, yesterday
exchanged his skis for a pair of driving gloves as he launched the new
Ferrari, which the famous Formula One racing team hope will adopt
Tomba's winning ways during the forthcoming season.
Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo invited Tomba to lay his hands
on the new 412 T2 car, designed by the Briton, John Barnard, in the hope
that a little of the skier's magic would rub off.
''It's a very ugly car, but it should be reliable and fast,'' joked di
Montezemolo, as the scarlet Ferrari was unveiled.
''There is no excuse for failure this season. I am expecting more than
just the one win we had in 1994,'' he added.
Ferrari, who have won more grands prix than any other team in the
history of the sport, have again fixed up Austrian Gerhard Berger and
Frenchman Jean Alesi as their two drivers for the season.
The first race of the campaign is scheduled for March 26, when the F1
circus heads for Sao Paula and the Brazilian Grand Prix.

THE northern lights are shining brightly in Scottish women's
volleyball. Hazlehead, an Aberdeen District League side less than a
decade ago, have come of age.
Having beaten champions MCA Powerhouse Cardinals the previous week,
Hazlehead defeated MCA's nearest challengers, Rucanor Jets on Saturday.
Hazlehead reached the Royal Bank Scottish Women's Cup final three
years, losing in five sets to Jets. Having lost some players from that
cup final squad, the new generation are now looking like serious
challengers under German coach Bernie Hube.
Saturday's win possibly comes too late for them to threaten MCA's
title, but they are now favourites to finish second and must also be a
good bet for the cup. They reached the last four by beating Glenrothes
Olympiad on Sunday.
In the men's first division, City of Glasgow Ragazzi are looking
increasingly formidable. Their cup quarter-final win over TB Mackay ES
Pentland on Sunday came 24 hours after a convincing win over Dundee in
the league.

THE Glasgow Cup final will return to Hampden Park this season.
The tournament for the five Glasgow clubs who field their youth sides
will be played during March and April at the grounds of junior clubs
Pollok and Petershill. But the final, on Sunday, April 30, will go ahead
at the national stadium.
Meanwhile, Billy Lamont, the Alloa manager, has spoken about the
problems of midweek football in the winter for those in charge of
part-time clubs.
''I have to work out one line up for an evening game while trying to
keep my options open for Saturday,'' he said.
Alloa are back in the Division 3 promotion scene but now meet East
Stirling tonight and travel to Ross County on Saturday.
''The heavy conditions at this time of year are an added problem for
part-timers. Many of them cannot perform in three games in a week, and
that means I have to decide who to play midweek and who to leave out so
that we can freshen the side for Saturday.''
With this in mind, Lamont will check conditions this evening, while
East Stirling manager Billy Little has the full-strength squad.

WILLIE Miller, never one for long orations, was short and to the point
last night after he had been sacked as manager of Aberdeen, directing a
scathing attack at the club's directors, whom he accused of having left
him alone ''in the trenches.''
A 24-year connection with the Pittodrie club as player and manager was
terminated after a three-hour board meeting called yesterday to discuss
the team's plight, and before silence had fallen over Pittodrie last
night Jimmy Nicholl emerged as a strong front-runner for the vacant
position.
Having watched their team slump to second-bottom place in the premier
division with only 12 matches remaining, the directors felt they had to
intervene. After their lengthy session, chairman Ian Donald, his voice
strained with emotion, read out a short statement which ended an era and
also Miller's #90,000-a-year job.
''It is with great regret and disappointment that the board has
decided to terminate the employment of the club's manager Willie
Miller,'' he began.
''He has served the club as player and manager with total commitment
and dedication throughout. The board feels, however, that the present
position necessitates this change.''
Miller was not in the mood to go quietly as his predecessor, Alex
Smith, had done and replied: ''The chairman has put you in the picture
about what has happened and, to be honest after his comments about my
position last night and this morning, it does not surprise me.
''I have made my feelings clear that he had totally undermined my
position. I was with the players charting the way forward to get
ourselves up the league and was demanding certain things from them.
There was no point in doing that if they were picking up papers reading
that I may or may not be in a job.
''I was willing to slog it out and get into the trenches to get the
club into a respectable position. Unfortunately I was in the trenches
myself.''
Miller, who was the supporters' choice to succeed Smith, expressed his
disappointed and pointed out that he believes he was still entitled to
leave with his head high and by the front door.
''I do things in a certain way and I have no regrets about what I have
done in my three years here,'' he said. ''The directors made a decision.
I respect it, but I don't agree with it.
''I don't have to justify my record. Any manager would be happy with
the record I have, although our league position is very disappointing.''
He blamed the lack of finance at Pittodrie for bringing about the
decision to sack him and he insisted Aberdeen must change or they will
never compete successfully again with Rangers and Celtic.
''The expectations of the fans are to challenge the Old Firm, but
Aberdeen do not have the finance to do that. They know I would have
sweated blood to bring success here,'' he added.
''I spent a certain amount of cash on players, but I also sold others
I didn't want to lose to finance new players coming in.''
Before leaving Pittdorie he also said he didn't believe Aberdeen would
enjoy a repeat of the '80s when the club were able to compete with the
Old Firm on equal terms. ''Now that Celtic have sorted themselves out
they can spend more than us,'' he stressed. ''The whole game in Scotland
has changed and Aberdeen must change to compete.''
Miller's assistant Roy Aitken has been put in charge until the end of
the season and if the former Celtic captain can turn the Dons around he
will certainly be among the contenders for the vacant manager's job.
However, he will have stern opposition from various other candidates
including Gordon Strachan, who after Miller, is regarded as one of the
Aberdeen's genuine heroes.
Only recently Strachan decided to end his career at the top level with
Leeds United, although he is still willing to play for the reserve side
which he is also coaching. He is bound to be interested, although the
precarious position in which Aberdeen find themselves wil not appeal to
anyone starting out on a managerial career.
On the other hand, it might be exactly the kind of task which could
entice Tommy McLean, who is thought to be disillusioned already at
Tynecastle. He has proven record and is certainly able to get the best
out of limited resources, although at Pittodrie he would be starting out
with better players than he had when he took over at Motherwell and then
Hearts.
Two other former Aberdeen players, Mark McGhee and Alex McLeish, who
have already shown they may have the necessary qualities to become good
managers, also must be considered as Miller's successors although the
opportunity may have come too late for McGhee. He has only recently
taken over as manager of Leicester City.
There will be backing also for Falkirk's Jim Jefferies, another who
has worked a small miracle on a shoe-string budget, and a tempting
outside bet for the job might be Steve Archibald, of East Fife.
However, Raith Rovers' manager Nicholl has strong and impressive
credentials having taken the first division side to a Coca Cola Cup
triumph against Celtic a little longer than two months ago. Nicholl is
also highly regarded by Dundee United, who might also be looking for a
new manager when Ivan Golac's contract ends in May.
Raith Rovers, it is understood, have agreed that should a bigger club
come for their manager they would not block any advances.

CELTIC could face suspension from the premier division if they go
through with a threat to dismiss any ruling handed down by the three-man
arbitration panel which will sit in judgment on the compensation claim
brought by Kilmarnock.
The SFA have received indication from Celtic that they will be
unwilling to abide by whatever decision may be reached by the panel,
which will be chaired by Lord Ranald McLean, and if they carry out that
threat the association would have little option other than to tell the
club they could no longer play in the Scottish League.
It would be a high price to pay for their belief that football's
methods are wrong.
Celtic have already been forced to pay #100,000 -- a record penalty --
to the Scottish League after having been found guilty of illegally
tempting Burns to break his contract with Kilmarnock during the last
close season to manage Celtic. Burns' assistant manager at Rugby Park,
Billy Stark, also left to take up a similar position at Cetic Park and
Kilmarnock have been pursuing compensation for their managerial losses
ever since.
Celtic's managing director Fergus McCann believes he has done nothing
wrong, and still appears determined to resist any further attempts to
make his club pay out any more money over this issue, but he must look
ahead and recognise the danger which lies up ahead.
The SFA's executive committee will meet today to discuss
correspondence from Celtic to the effect that they may not accept the
panel's decision as binding. The committee will either make a ruling of
their own today or they will instruct the panel, which will consist of
former Hearts director Jim Clydesdale and Morton chairman John Wilson,
to meet, probably early next month and tell them to adjudicate
regardless.
The SFA would expect Celtic to comply and if McCann were to resist,
the ultimate sanction could be applied.
It has to be said that the attitude displayed by Celtic throughout
this saga has done nothing to endear the club to other league members.
In fact, by continuing to be intransigent Celtic are alienating
themselves.
McCann's only comment last night was that he did not ''consider it
appropriate to comment,'' but before this matter has been resolved he
may be required to be much more expansive. The SFA's chief executive Jim
Farry has been monitoring the matter and he, too, can be a tough
character to win over if he feels his association's authority is being
undermined.

WHEN Kate Staples was driven to the Birmingham indoor arena for her
international athletics debut, against Russia, she hid her head in her
hands, willing herself not to look.
Travelling to the first ever international pole vault event for women,
Staples was accutely aware that she was a very different being from the
one who regularly graces the same arena in the personna of Zodiac the
Gladiator.
Statuesque is the adjective most frequently applied to the 29-year-old
Essex woman. Confident is another which springs to mind. Yet she insists
that if she has that aura, it is something of an illusion. ''I more or
less turned away from sport when I was younger because I didn't believe
in myself,'' she confided.
Staples was named yesterday for the British team which faces France at
the Kelvin Hall on Saturday, and although sport prediction is a risk
business, forecasting a record from Staples is one of the less hazardous
speculations. There have been 25 to date, and she hopes for the
twenty-sixth in Glasgow.
But she laughs at suggestions that the Staples' diet of records is the
female equivalent of men's world record holder Sergey Bubka, who nudges
up the record to order, cash on delivery, one centimetre at a time.
''It's hard work for me,'' she says. ''Three weeks ago, I just looked
at 3.80 metres (her latest mark), and the bar seemed high and
intimidating. But now it appears normal. I'm looking forward to
competing in Glasgow, and hope I can go higher again.''
The French No.1, Caroline Ammel, has cleared 3.91m, but only 3.40m
this season.
The event, a new one for women, is developing fast. The world record
is 4.10m, by reinstated Chinese drug cheat Sun Caiyun. But Staples'
coach, former British Olympian Brian Hooper, believes it will rise
quickly.
''It will be 4.50m within two years, and I'm convinced Kate will be
that person,'' he said.
Hooper, who has coached Staples for the past three years, is familiar
with the schizophrenic existence of the sports star-entertainer. As a
pole-vaulter, he competed in three European and two Commonwealth
championships, plus two Olympics. He set 34 UK records and eight
Commonwealth ones, and claims to be the longest-serving British
internationalist, having been a regular for 15 years.
But he also was a TV personality as world Superstars champion.
Staples has recently completed a season in pantomime, as Belle in
Beauty And The Beast. And she is accustomed to 10,000 crowds in
Gladiators -- far more than at indoor athletics.
''But I don't want the two confused,'' she says. ''I very much want to
be taken as a serious athlete.''
To that end, she was training at 7.30am after panto stints ending at
midnight. ''It was too lucrative to turn down, for I'd just bought a
house. I was on stage for two hours every night, and fell asleep over my
Christmas dinner. The Gladiator schedule involves filming two shows a
day, 11 hours at a stretch, for seven weeks. With all that, it has been
really hard to maintain training discipline.''
Her mother, a school headmistress, dismissed overtures for her
daughter to train for sport, so Staples came into athletics late,
through sports marketing and management, including looking after Olympic
swim champion Adrian Moorhouse. ''My dream had always been to be an
athlete. Dealing with Adrian, and Brian let me see that Olympians are
just ordinary people, with talent, who work very hard.''
The presence of Staples, and more established stars, has meant a
turn-around for the sponsorless event. The organisers expect to be able
to announce a backer by the end of the week. Ticket hotline: 0141 337
1806.

HE was a formidable leader of footballing men in his days at the heart
of Aberdeen's defence, but always, he was a man apart. Yesterday, Willie
Miller became a man alone.
Introverted and perhaps also insular, Aberdeen's most celebrated
footballing son tried to make it in the world of management, and despite
the fact that all who had watched him play preferred to believe he was a
man of steely determination and destined to succeed, he failed.
He was, so far as Aberdeen's fans were concerned, the stuff of legend,
but football has a dreadful habit of humbling its heroes.
It was only yesterday Miller was informed officially that his term as
manager of Aberdeen was at an end, but if the truth be told, his end was
approaching fast almost from the beginning of this season.
Since last August, the start of this current premier-division season,
the realisation that his powers, his aura of invincibility had been lost
somewhere in the transition from dressing room to manager's office, was
dawning.
Miller, the people's choice to succeed Alex Smith, whose sacking three
years ago -- give or take a week -- was a shameful episode in Aberdeen's
history, could not extract the best from a squad of players who must
also shoulder a considerable amount of the blame for the club's rapid
decline.
He tried reason, and he tried insult, but no matter what he did, the
response was never emphatic enough.
Injuries denied him frequent use of his main players -- Duncan
Shearer, Eoin Jess, and Scott Booth -- and Saturday's defeat by
Kilmarnock at Rugby Park was the final straw for directors terror
stricken by the spectre of relegation.
It is difficult to know what Miller was thinking as he watched his
team's downward spiral. He never said. In fact, he never did accept the
necessity to become a more gregarious and expansive man than he actually
was, and his lack of communication must be marked down as one of the
reasons for his downfall.
Miller could always scream his team's defence as captain of a
thrilling Aberdeen side which reached its zenith under the managership
of Alex Ferguson, but this was Miller running on pure adrenalin. Without
natural jouces coursing through his veins, he was much more private and
reticent. Much more in character.
The real Miller was never likely to urge his troops into battle by
bursting into a dressing room at half time and delivering a
Gettysburg-type message.
In short, he was, and is a man of few words, although he contradicted
himself yesterday by talking out against the Pittodrie regime which he
believes has forsaken him. His words were in stark contrast to those he
uttered that day three years ago as a forlorn Alex Smith was trudging
out of Pittodrie after his last meeting with the directors.
''The past is in the past, and I'm looking forward to the future,'' he
said then. Yesterday that future became another miserable part of the
club's path as he followed in Smith's footsteps.
Along with Roy Aitken, brought in as assistant manager in June 1992,
Miller set about a restructuring programme, but it was clear the
response from the dressing room was less than enthusiastic. Indeed, it
became increasingly obvious in recent months that he had lost his
dressing room.
Yesterday he lost it all.
Failure will eat deeply into Miller's psyche, and although he is much
too proud an individual to allow any public demonstrations of his pain,
it could be some time before he comes to terms with what has happened to
him. He was used to winning. It became a way of life, and he became a
hero.
Under Ferguson's rule, 10 trophies were taken north in eight seasons
and even under Smith, whose work at Pittodrie was terribly undervalued,
three majpor prizes in four years were collected. Aberdeen could not
have taken such a haul were it not for the extremely influential
presence of Miller in defence, but ironically he could not find anyone
to replace either himself or his long-time playing partner Alex McLeish.
The supporters came to regard him as a legend in their part of their
world, and expected great things from him as a manager, but despite
having played in more than 900 matches for Aberdeen, he was not really a
super hero. He is only a man after all, and prone to self doubt and
error like the rest of us.
However, it would be wrong if his struggle to manage the club were
allowed to overshadow a contribution as a player which was immeasurable.
Miller should be allowed to retain his status as Aberdeen's greatest
playing servant.
Among hs own prized possessions are 65 international caps, winners'
medals from the European Cup-winners' Cup, European Super Cup, and three
league championship winners' badges. His treasure chest contains many
more baubles, but these are among the most cherished.
Of course, he is also immensely proud of his MBE, which he was awarded
in June 1991.
Life then was sweet even though he had to retire from the pitch
because of a knee injury which he suffered while serving Scotland. It
did seem then Miller was destined for further greatness, but football is
a game of a chance, a fickle profession which very quickly can humble
the biggest and the strongest.
Hurt and confusion may have deluded him to believe the directors
denied him the support he required, but he was not exactly a penniless
manager. He spent almost #2m on players (Billy Dodds, John Inglis, Colin
Woodthorpe, and Peter Hetherston) and while in the wider world that was
not a considerable sum, it was a hefty layout by a club rebuilding part
of its stadium.
Miller had his chance, but even Granite City legends are fallible.
'He was the stuff of legend,
but football has a dreadful
habit of humbling its heroes'

WANTED by the Scottish Rugby Union -- strong, green grass to put the
finishing touch to its #45m new stadium at Murrayfield.
Opened officially as recently as November 19, the showpiece home of
Scotland's national XV is revealing signs of wear which were visible
during last Saturday's Five Nations' international against Ireland.
Yesterday, a stretch along the west side of the pitch was bare and
muddy, particularly towards the south-west corner.
The SRU knew there would be problems on the playing surface when it
embarked on the reconstruction of Murrayfield, which is now a bowl with
stands to north, south, east, and west, and seats 67,500 spectators.
The Welsh and French rugby unions were consulted for their experience
of enclosed stadiums before the project began.
A major factor in the situation is the new west stand, the main stand,
which has a cantilevered roof 48.5 metres wide. A third of the roof was
built with clear polycarbonate cladding to admit as much sunlight as
possible to the grass.
A rugby pitch, like a human being, has to be nourished properly. The
SRU had to think about sunlight and wind reaching the pitch.
Bill Elwood, head groundsman, admitted yesterday the existing grass
was not liking its new environment. It was not as healthy as had
normally been the case.
What was needed now, he said, was seed to grow grass that would be
''more tolerant to shade and more tolerant to hard wear and tear.''
Elwood said the SRU would look at the environmental problems, and
grass experts were being consulted. ''Given the time, we will solve
this,'' he said.
The international pitch, he said, had been used considerably since
October, with a number of senior and under-21 matches being played on
the same day and, at one stage, four matches in eight days.
This had coincided with bad weather, the pitch had been denuded of
grass and became waterlogged. The undersoil heating had been on
constantly since early November and this could have caused the roots to
be burned.
''We will try to create a more open soil for the roots, to let air
develop around the roots to create stronger grass,'' he said.
''We are hoping by the time the Welsh game is played on March 4,
nature will create some growth of grass.''
Mr Elwood said one outcome of the new stadium's construction was that
winds blew strongly across the roofs of the stands but the air was calm
at field level.
He said drainage, which in the past had caused difficulties at Ibrox
Stadium, was not a problem at Murrayfield where the drains were renewed
four years ago.
Murrayfield is not likely to gain an early respite as Scotland plays
an additional international against Romania in April. The stadium is
then committed to staging American football for two-and-a-half months up
to the end of June.
Remedies are likely to be tackled by the SRU's own staff, who carry
out a renovation of the field at the end of each season.
Workers in the stadium yesterday appeared untroubled and were
confident the answer would be found. It was, after all, as one member of
staff observed, like living in a new house.

MEL Neef has another date with the pain game on Saturday, but only one
of the opponents she wanted.
City of Glasgow's multiple sprint record breaker has been paired in
the 400 metres with World and Olympic champion Sally Gunnell in an elite
British team which includes five other Scots for their match against
France at the Kelvin Hall.
The visitors have omitted their Olympic, World and European champion,
Marie-Jose Perec. Instead they will field two relative novices,
Marie-Louise Bevis and Valerie Jaunatre, neither of whom have run within
a second and a half of the Scot.
Neef, whose face was a crumpled mask of agony after her
record-breaking AAA win last weekend, had hoped both Olympic champions
would be there to push her. ''Sally is still British No.1 indoors, and
competing against her should give me the chance to run my best time,''
said Neef. ''But she's there to be beaten.''
Linford Christie, Colin Jackson, John Regis and drug-reinstated
Solomon Wariso are all listed, and an extra edge is given to the hurdles
pairing of Jackson and Tony Jarrett. On Sunday, Jarrett came closer to
beating his rival than any man in nearly 40 races. Both were timed at
7.44secs, with only the camera giving the Welshman the verdict.
Grant Graham's AAA 1500m victory has won him a debut senior vest --
but what a baptism. He faces Eric Dubus, who ran a French record of
7-43.44 for 3000m on Sunday, the fifteenth fastest time in history, and
Vincent Terrier who has clocked
3-46.88 for 1500m indoors, substantially quicker than the former
Scottish schools champion.
Clydesdale's Graham has been paired with Ian Grime, while Dundee's Ian
Campbell, still fastest in Britain, runs only as a reserve.
Brian Whittle may be able to use his experience of the tight bends to
gain revenge over teenager Mark Hylton in the 400m. Neither Frenchman in
the men's 800m has broken 1-50.00, so Tom McKean's biggest challenge
will come from team mate Martin Steele, while high jumper Geoff Parsons
faces Jean-Charles Gicquel, the European silver medallist. British team:
MEN. 60m: L Christie, M Rosswess. 200m: J Regis, S Wariso. 400m: M

Falkirk 0, Motherwell 2
THIS cup-tie ended in drama when Motherwell's Chris McCart was sent
off for a foul on Steve Fulton at the edge of the box.
The Motherwell skipper was red-carded by referee Jim McCluskey under
the ''last man'' rule, but by that time, McCart's side had already
booked their place in the fourth round of the Tennents Scottish Cup.
There, they will meet Hibs at Easter Road, and Alex Miller's No.2,
Jocky Scott, was at Brockville last night to run the rule over his
side's next opponents.
Falkirk were given a boost before a ball was kicked with the
non-appearance of injured Tommy Coyne, who had caused them so much
heartache in the game that ended abruptly last week.
His absence created a rare opening for Alex Burns who, although having
made only two appearances this season, had nevertheless established
himself as something of a cup expert, scoring in Coca-Cola and UEFA Cup
ties.
The match started well. A long clearance from Falkirk keeper Tony
Parks was helped on by Jamie McGowan to Eddie May right in front of
goal. The ex-Hibs player achieved the first part of his objective with a
well-judged header which left Motherwell keeper Stevie Woods helpless,
but the killer blow proved more elusive, and the ball bounced back off
the bar.
Motherwell's rather ungracious response to the let-off was to take the
game by the scruff of the neck.
Billy Davies had a great chance in nine minutes, courtesy of a superb
running pass from Paul McGrillen, but in trying to make sure the move
was given the perfect finish it deserved, the midfielder delayed just a
fraction too long and the danger was cleared.
Davies was booked in 15 minutes just after Rob McKinnon had watched
one of those rasping left-foot shots of his whistle past a post. Then
Colin McDonald looked on as his effort bounce off John Philliben in 28
minutes, but with 10 minutes of the first-half left, the visitors went
in front.
Appropriately it was comeback man Burns who scored. He collected the
ball on the left before cutting inside Neil Oliver and beating Parks
with a right-foot shot which took a deflection off Falkirk defender Joe
McLaughlin.
A blunder by defender Tommy Queen in 54 minutes led to Motherwell
going two in front, and left Falkirk with a mountain to climb.
The ball slipped from McQueen's grasp as he tried to take a throw-in.
It landed at the feet of Paul Lambert, and the former Scotland Under-21
player picked out Burns as he raced through the middle.
Falkirk's David Weir made a valiant attempt to get back as Parks raced
from his goal, but their efforts were in vain. The ball bounced kindly
for the Motherwell striker, and he had the simple task of knocking the
ball home.
Motherwell manager Alex McLeish said that his side were ''terrific. We
started with a wee scare but we controlled it after that,'' while
Jefferies summed up his team's exit by saying: ''We lost two crazy goals
and when you do that you give yourself mountains to climb.''
FALKIRK -- Parks, Weir, McQueen, Oliver, McLaughlin, Rice, May,
McGowan, McDonald, Fulton, McKenzie. Substitutes -- Henderson, James,
Lamont.
MOTHERWELL -- Woods, Philliben,  McKinnon, Krivokapic, Martin, McCart,

Meadowbank Thistle 1,
Berwick Rangers 1
THESE teams have to do it all again at Shielfield Park tonight, to
earn the right to meet Celtic in the fourth round of the Tennents
Scottish Cup after a struggle in Edinburgh last night.
Berwick had the wind in the first half but failed to take advantage of
many chances, with home keeper Steve Ellison denying Willie Irvine on
three occasions.
Mark Cowan broke the deadlock after the hour mark but for Thistle, not
Berwick. A Williamson cross was half cleared, but Cowan's back header
went right over keeper Osborne into the empty net.
The visitors swept back and equalised seven minutes later. Kevin
Kane's cross was pushed out by Ellison, and Graham Fraser shot low into
a corner.
Cowan, Hawke, and Kane were booked for Berwick.
MEADOWBANK THISTLE -- Ellison, Davidson, Martin, Williamson, Thomson,
Sorbie, Wilson, Bailey, Harris, McLeod, Sinclair. Substitutes -- Little,
Samuel, Douglas.
BERWICK RANGERS -- Osborne, Greenwood, Banks, Valentine, Cowan,

THERE were no raised eyebrows when Jack Rowell yesterday named an
unchanged England rugby team for the Five Nations' clash with Wales in
Cardiff on February 18.
The England manager has kept faith with the line-up that has claimed
victories over Ireland and France in their opening championship matches.
''The players choose themselves,'' said Rowell. ''They have made our
job of naming them again a formality.''
While delighted with England's progress since he took charge in May,
Rowell pinpointed defects that need to be ironed out. ''On Saturday,''
he said, ''the lineout was a jungle and we have to cope with that.
''We did not quite manage it against the French, but we did so many
other productive things around the pitch that we were able to overcome
this one area of relative weakness. But it is an area we will sort
out.'' Team:
M J Catt (Bath); T Underwood (Leicester), W D C Carling (Harlequins,
capt), J C Guscott (Bath), R Underwood (Leicester); C R Andrew (Wasps),
K P P Bracken (Bristol); J Leonard (Harlequins), B C Moore (Harlequins),
V E Ubogu (Bath), M O Johnson (Leicester), M C Bayfield (Northampton), T
A K Rodber (Northampton), D Richards (Leicester), B B Clarke (Bath).
Replacements -- J E B Callard Bath), P R de Glanville (Bath), C D Morris

GRAHAM Gooch and Mike Gatting will turn their backs on Test cricket
today insisting: ''We've no regrets.'' The two former England captains
played their last innings yesterday and were given three cheers by Mark
Taylor's Australian side.
The retirement party lasted just 26 minutes. Both failed to finish
with the flourish they wanted -- Gooch making only four and Gatting just
eight as England crumbled to 27 for 5 and the brink of fifth Test
defeat.
''I wasn't as sentimental as I thought I would be,'' said Gooch, who
in his 118 Tests has scored 8900 runs at an average of 42.58. ''But it
was good of the Australian team to give me three cheers when I reached
the crease. It was a nice thought and it meant a lot to me. It would
have been good to end with a few runs. But I've had a great career.''
Gatting, who scored 4409 runs in his 79 Tests at an average of 35.55,
spent all but the 16 minutes it took him to score eight runs resting a
torn muscle in his side.
Both veterans were dismissed by Craig McDermott, who has made a habit
of bringing the curtain down on famous careers. He did the same to
former West Indian captains Clive Lloyd and Viv Richards.
''There isn't any sentiment on the field,'' said the fast bowler who
spoiled the party. ''What is done is done. We had a job to do and I just
happened to be the one bowling at the right time.''
Gooch, in the twelfth delivery he faced, drove back to McDermott, the
ball sticking in the paceman's left hand after rebounding kindly off his
body. Gatting was bowled by a near-yorker, and Australia could scent a
kill.
Angus Fraser, sent in as a nightwatchman, was dropped by Angel at
short cover off McDermott before scoring. But McGrath soon removed him
lbw to expose England's younger middle order.
Graham Thorpe, a first innings century-maker, edged McGrath's next
delivery to Taylor at first slip, while John Crawley completed a sad
'pair' with another snick off McDermott, this time to Mark Waugh at
second slip.
Australia's newest star, meanwhile, has made himself open to offers.
Greg Blewett, who yesterday made it two centuries in his first two
Tests, said: ''I would have to look at playing county cricket in England
if someone asked me. I'm open to offers.''

IN a surprise move, ScottishPower announced yesterday that its chief
executive, Dr Ian Preston, would leave the company four months earlier
than planned.
When the appointment of successor, Mr Ian Robinson, was announced in
December, it was intended that Dr Preston would remain at the Atlantic
Quay headquarters in Glasgow as deputy chairman until July.
However, Dr Preston will now leave at the end of this month. The
company refused to comment yesterday on industry rumours that Mr
Robinson had been unhappy with the prospect of an extended hand-over
period.
ScottishPower's chairman, Mr Murray Stuart, said: ''In view of the
importance and the nature of new roles offered to Dr Preston, we have
agreed that he can relinquish his duties and his directorship earlier
than planned.''
A ScottishPower spokesman said that Dr Preston's retirement from the
company had been brought forward to ''everybody's mutual satisfaction''.
Dr Preston, 62, has just been appointed chairman of the East of
Scotland Water Authority, which is due to take over water and sewerage
services from council control next year.
Last week, the engineering company Motherwell Bridge announced his
appointment as a non-executive director. Dr Preston is also a
non-executive director of merchant bank Morgan Grenfell and Clydeport.
Mr Stuart added that he was delighted Dr Preston's talents would
continue to be put to good use for the benefit of Scotland.
Mr Robinson, currently head of Trafalgar House's engineering division,
takes up the #255,000-a-year post on March 1.
In a mixed electricity sector, ScottishPower shares advanced 8p to
332p, with its northern counterpart Hydro-Electric up 3p to 316p.
Dr Preston, who worked for with the group for 30 years, has run
central Scotland's electricity generator and supplier since its
flotation three-and-a-half years ago.
Mr Robinson has worked for Trafalgar House since 1986, first with the
Glasgow-based John Brown subsidiary, and then as a full board member in
charge of the parent group's entire engineering arm.
His wide international experience in sectors ranging from power to
pharmaceuticals is thought to have been the reason for his appointment.

The lobby for a national theatre company is said to have won the
argument that a significant and increasing home-grown dramatic
repertoire exists in Scotland. Why is it not getting its due on stage
from existing companies? Over the coming weeks The Herald's drama
writers will be considering what's on offer in the context of the
current season. Mark Fisher kicks off the debate by wondering if we
undervalue our playwrights.
FIRST the shameless plug. An anthology of Scottish plays is published
this month by Methuen called Made in Scotland. It includes the scripts
of Sue Glover's Bondagers, Simon Donald's The Life of Stuff, Mike
Cullen's The Cut, and Duncan McLean's Julie Allardyce, and the whole
package is selected and introduced by Ian Brown of The Traverse Theatre
-- and me. Buying it in quantity will enrich your life and my bank
balance.
There ends the commercial break. The shame of it is that the
publication of such a collection should seem like an event. I don't
expect dancing in the street, but Scottish plays rarely make it into
print and it is cause for comment when they do. It's getting on for five
years since the last Scottish compilation was brought out -- Scot-Free,
edited by the late Alistair Cameron -- with only a sporadic supply of
individual plays in the meantime.
Over the past three years Theatre Scotland magazine has included a
script with each quarterly issue, the literary journal Chapman has
published George Gunn and George Rosie, the new publisher Dualchas has
brought out a couple of plays by Glasgow writers, and in London Oberon
Books has stayed loyal to Robert David MacDonald and his Citizens'
Theatre translations.    I could add a few others, but it would never
make an overwhelming list.
There are three conclusions you could draw from this. One is that the
publishing industry is too London-centric to notice any play that has
not been a hit in the capital. Another is that Scotland simply lacks
playwrights of sufficient ability to justify publication. And the third,
and I would argue most persuasive, is that the low level of publication
actually reflects a theatrical set-up that fails to make the most of its
playwrights.
What we need is more new plays being seen by more theatregoers. You
can't blame publishers for not bringing out plays that few people have
heard of. The publication of scripts may be important in terms of
encouraging second productions, raising the writers' credibility, and
generating a sense of a living repertoire, but in terms of selling
copies, the market is small enough without publishers having to take a
gamble on the worthy but obscure.
Even if everyone who saw a sell-out run of a play at The Traverse or
the Tron bought  a copy of the script, it would sell less than the
equivalent of 5% of today's edition of The Herald. That situation will
never change significantly, but things would improve if the contribution
of our playwrights to public life was held in higher regard.
The problem is not at the first stage of the process; companies like
Wiseguise, 7:84, Annexe, TAG, the Tron, and The Traverse ensure that
we're being introduced to new writers all the time. The sticking point
comes after that. A playwright starts to learn the ropes in the relative
security of the smallscale theatres, looks around for the next step up,
and discovers there isn't one.
The phrase ''the glass ceiling'' has been coined to describe the
barrier preventing women achieving positions of authority in their
careers. But it could apply equally to Scottish playwrights who are
regularly feted as bright young hopes but are only ever seen by a
minority of theatregoers.
Leaving aside the writers of pantomimes and Christmas shows, I can
think of only three contemporary Scottish playwrights who can have any
confidence of their work being seen on main stages in their home
country. They are Tony Roper, on the strength of The Steamie, John
Byrne, whose most recent work has not been seen in Scotland, and Liz
Lochhead, who has her finger in so many pies that it's been several
years since a new big-scale work by her has been seen here.
And what of the hotly tipped next generation? Chris Hannan, Iain
Heggie, Peter Arnott, and John Clifford have been at the game long
enough reasonably to expect to find a big audience eager to see their
latest plays, but if you see their work at all it will either be outside
Scotland or in the very same theatres they started out at over a decade
ago.
And if we don't see their work you would think it reasonable to see
the generation before them -- Stewart Conn, Donald Campbell, Hector
MacMillan, and so on. But no, we invest time and resources on promising
writers, only to see  that investment squandered as they become
disillusioned like Iain Heggie or so broke that they have to take
alternative employment, like John Clifford who recently joined the staff
at Glasgow University and will cut his theatrical output accordingly.
There's no mystery to this. All it needs is somebody with the will to
change things. Somebody like Michael Boyd of Glasgow's Tron Theatre,
perhaps, who has recognised in David Kane's Dumbstruck! the potential
for a big popular hit.
The play had a debut run at the Tron last Mayfest but it's coming back
this year to play most of Scotland's main stages, from His Majesty's,
Aberdeen, to the King's Theatre, Glasgow, just as The Steamie has done
before it, which in itself proves that it's not simply a case of blaming
the managements of the big theatres; they, after all, have their own
priorities and a shrewd sense of what their audiences want.
It's more a matter of waiting for that director or programmer or
theatre or city to try it out, to generate a real sense of interest in
what our playwrights have to say, about themselves, about their
imaginations, about our culture.
Until someone does that we can only assume that people just don't
care.

MOROCCAN Hicham Arazil caused a big upset by beating 1993 champion
Karel Novacek, of the Czech Republic, 7-6, 6-7, 6-2 to move into the
second round of the Dubai Tennis Open.
Novacek, ranked No.26 in the world, raced into a 5-2 lead, but the
Moroccan controlled his game and, with a string of brilliant shots,
forced the set into a tie-breaker which he won 7-4.
Hicham could have wrapped up the match in the second set, but wasted
two match points at 5-4 and another at 6-5 before dropping the set.
In the decider, the 21-year-old Hicham was much less generous. After
having taken a 3-0 lead he wrapped up the set and, with it, the match.
Eighth seed Alex Corretja, of Spain, was earlier knocked out by
Sweden's Henrik Holm in a closely-fought clash. Holm, who saved a match
point, won 4-6, 6-2, 7-5.

WELSHMAN Terry Griffiths completed an astounding hat trick of
victories over old snooker adversary Steve Davis at Wembley Conference
Centre last night. The 47-year-old former World champion from Llanelli
booked his place in the quarter-finals of the #435,000 Benson &amp; Hedges
Masters with a 5-3 win.
Amazingly Griffiths, easily the most senior member of this year's
Masters field, has now got the better of Davis on three successive
occasions since mid-December.
Prior to that, Davis led Griffiths 25-5 in career meetings, but
Griffiths beat him in the last 16 of the Antwerp-hosted European Open,
and also knocked him out of last month's Liverpool Victoria Charity
Challenge in Birmingham.
Although Griffiths won a low-quality first frame on the blue, Davis
looked the stronger player as he established a 2-1 lead with breaks of
61 and 80.
But Griffiths then began to cue sweetly, and runs of 40, 99 and a
magnificent 125 clearance enabled him to forge 4-2 ahead. By taking a
dour 47 minute seventh frame Davis raised hopes of a comeback but
Griffiths held firm in the next.
Griffiths will now play John Parrott or Ronnie O'Sullivan in the last
eight. Now it is back to the drawing board for Davis, who came into the
tournament fully expecting to enjoy an extended run after winning last
week's Regal Welsh Open.

Peter Ebdon earlier had set up a rematch with world snooker champion
Stephen Hendry when he defeated Irishman Ken Doherty 5-3.
Doherty, who defeated Jimmy White at the corresponding stage of the
Masters 12 months ago, was on course to suffer a taste of his own
medicine as Ebdon established a 3-0 lead.
However, Doherty, who failed to survive the first round of last
month's Liverpool-Victoria Charity Challenge, found some momentum either
side of the interval.
He fired in breaks of 33, 44, and 85 to draw level and when he opened
the scoring in frame seven, he appeared set to edge ahead for the first
time.
It was not to be, though, and Ebdon fashioned a magnificent 103
clearance to regain control.
Willie Thorne crashed 5-0 to Welsh teenager Mark Williams in the
opening round.

THE four-day Perth bull sales opened yesterday with a very sound trade
for Aberdeen-Angus bulls. However, the show judge, Mr Bob Crockatt, made
it clear that he was not totally happy with the overall standard.
''It's not a vintage show, and I was disappointed with the general
quality, although the top bulls were good,'' he said.
Mr Crockatt chose as his overall champion the April 1993 Lochdu
Elsunny Boy by Sunset Acres Bang from Mrs Lena Forbes, Lochdu, Nairn,
which he described as ''well balanced without being extreme''. The
champion, which also took the intermediate award, sold at 6000gns to the
commercial herd of Kinnordy Estates, Kirriemuir.
However, top price of 6200gns went to the first prize March 1993
Hurdcott Banker by Loyal of Hurdcott from Lord and Lady Glendyne,
Craigeassie, Forfar, which sold to David Walker, Galcantry, Nairn. The
Glendynes shortly afterwards caused a real stir in the ring when they
withdrew another of their bulls at 5000gns.
Selling at 6000gns was the senior and reserve supreme champion Finland
of the Moss from Mr and Mrs John Moores, North Moss, Formby, Lancashire.
This one by Scotch Cap sold to the leading meat wholesaler Mr Ian
Galloway for his recently established herd at Cardona, Doune, Stirling.
Mrs Forbes had a very good day and was back in the action selling her
junior champion Cambusbarron Pallet at 5300gns. Taking this one was
Stuart Macphie of Glenbervie Estate, Stonehaven. Mr Macphie is shortly
to spend #750,000 building a meat plant which will handle only
Aberdeen-Angus beef from his rapidly expanding beef unit.
A new record was established for a red Aberdeen-Angus bull when R and
A Tinto, Colmsliehill, Galashiels, paid 5000gns to W and D McLaren,
Netherton, Blackford, for the appropriately named Netherton Red
Blackeyes.
The reserve intermediate champion Carhurlie Laredo from Rae Grieve,
Carhurlie, Lundin Links, Fife, sold at 4000gns to John Jameson, Nether
Baulk, Stonehaven, while the reserve junior champion Wedderlie Ebonyman
from Mrs J R L Campbell, Wedderlie, Gordon, Berwickshire, sold at
3400gns to Liam Muir, Orkney.
Another two of the best bulls went to Orkney, with the first at
4600gns from William Lawson, Windsole, Auchterarder, Perth, going to
Terry Coghill, Muce, while A and A Foubister, Netherton Holm, paid
4000gns to T H Brewis, Eastfield of Lempitlaw, Kelso. Eastfield also
sold at 3600gns to James Scott, Fearn, Ross-shire.
Meanwhile, R and D Farquhar, Tewel, Stonehaven, paid 4200gns to D W
and J E Oakley, Newport, Shropshire, while the president of the Scottish
Rugby Union, Ken Smith, Ormiston, Kelso, went to 3800gns to secure a
first prize winner from David Evans, Cefn, Gwent.
Overall, 43 A-A bulls averaged #3134.13 -- up #80.04 on 1994, when 52
bulls were sold.
Angus females also enjoyed a fine trade, selling twice to a peak of
3800gns. First to hit that mark was the supreme champion from Miss
Elizabeth Bayne-Jardine, Humbie Mains, Haddington, which sold to Rae
Grieve.
The Netherton herd had a great trade for their heifers with their
reserve champion selling at 3800gns to Andrew Mylius, St Fort, Newport
on Tay.
Two from Netherton sold at 3000gns -- firstly to D B Sparks, Barmeal,
Newton Stewart, and then to Moncur Pedigree Herds, Inchture, Dundee.
The Queen Mother also sold at this level from her Castle of Mey herd
in Caithness to N Dobson, The Wall, Newport, Shropshire. The 33 A-A
heifers averaged #1882 -- up #131.
The retiring president of the Angus Society, Mr Jim Jack, from
Northern Ireland, said: ''Aberdeen-Angus is the buzz word at the present
time and the breed is on the up and up. But we, as custodians of the
breed, must never neglect the quality image of Aberdeen-Angus cattle.
''The breed is emerging from a period of change and there is a need
for more good cattle to meet the soaring demand.''
The small but excellent show of shorthorn bulls sold to a top of
4400gns for one from James Durno, Uppermill, Tarves, Aberdeenshire, to
James Biggar, Chapelton, Castle Douglas, while the champion from the
same herd sold at 3600gns to Snaigow Farms, Blairgowrie. The reserve
champion from Major John Gibb, Glenisla, Kirriemuir, made 3800gns to
Campbell Graham, Tangier, Drymen.
Eighteen shorthorn bulls averaged #2356 -- up #341 on last year when
18 were also sold. Hereford bulls sold to 2400gns from Alex Cant,
Craigton, Forfar, to John Cameron, Balbuthie, Ely. Auctioneers United

CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester Building Society has given Lloyds Bank
shareholders a foretaste of the possible outperformance from its
independent mortgage division that lies in store if the #1800m takeover
is completed as planned on August 1.
Aggressive marketing pushed new mortgage lending ahead by 40.6% to
#3075m, the highest level for three years.
That was helped by the policy of having no strings and no fees, which
has meant that C&amp;G has had to absorb the loss of commission on endowment
mortgages -- which it has now dropped -- and on valuations and
applications. These resulted in a drop in non-interest income from
#59.2m to #20m.
Net interest receivable, the surplus paid by mortgagees over that
dispensed to investors, rose #28m to #358m. That resulted in pre-bad
debt profits easing 10% to #258m. Happily, bad debt provisions have more
than halved, from #75.9m to #31.7m, with the number of mortgages more
than two months in arrears falling from 4.05% to 2.51%.
Pre-tax profits rose 8.5% to #219m, but that was after a #7.5m charge
for the first step in the Lloyds merger, with a similar sum expected to
be charged in the first half of the current financial year.
One benefit from the proposed takeover is that C&amp;G qualifying members
have been reluctant to run down balances, as they will receive a payment
of #500 and 13% of the account balance, up to a maximum of #13,500.
C&amp;G last week pledged to hold mortgage rates at least 0.25% below the
mean of its five main competitors until November.
Its cost income ratio increased from 26.4% to 31.9%, as a result of
the push for new business against a dull housing market. But that
compares favourably with the 63% or so likely to be announced by Lloyds,
with its preliminary statement on Friday likely to show 1994 pre-tax
profits increased from #1031m to about #1400m, depending in part upon
the level of provisioning on its exposure to Mexico.
Last Friday, C&amp;G tried to get a Bill through Parliament to pay a total
of up to #10m to widows and widowers of qualifying account holders. But
the second reading was stopped last Friday when Dennis Skinner, Labour
MP for Bolsover, shouted ''Object!''

SCOTTISH exports reached a record level during the final quarter of
1994, with total volume for the year up 22% to #14.08bn, according to
The Scottish Council Development and Industry.
SCDI business information manager Ian Armstrong said the latest
figures confirmed the export boom being experienced by Scottish
industry.
The quarterly export index rose faster than expected to 166.95 in the
fourth quarter, from 138.05 in the third and 126.90 a year earlier. The
value of exports during the three months was estimated at #4290m.
Companies in the mechanical engineering, electronics, paper, and food
and drinks sectors experienced particularly strong export growth.
Mr Armstrong said: ''Although past results indicate that Scottish
exports peak in the final quarter of each year, and the projections
given in the third quarter also predicted the likelihood of continued
growth in the index to 162.46, the rating actually achieved is higher
than anticipated.''
The index is expected to fall back slightly to 153.41 in the first
quarter of this year. However, this compares favourably with last year's
first quarter level of 114.66.
The SCDI survey covers companies believed to account for about 60% of
total Scottish exports, from a wide range of sectors.

ROB MACLAURIN'S work is always striking, his strong colours and brush
work evoking mood and atmosphere. The exhibition of the fruits of his
residency at Durham Cathedral (at Glasgow Print Studio to March 11) --
including The Brave Mason, above -- conveys the impact of a closed
environment on an artist who has travelled widely to Turkey, Kurdistan
and Slovenia.
The earliest pieces, based on ordnance survey maps and photographs,
show the area of Durham long before the cathedral was built 900 years
ago, and burn with rich yellows and oranges that belong to a far hotter
country. The internal pieces are subtle glimpses of humanity, single
figures overshadowed by the columns of the cathedral, and bright, open
panoramas of workers on the cathedral roof which glow with life and
reflect the vitality of the building.
The overwhelming significance of the cathedral, its spiritual power
and its history are there too. Smaller oil studies create as large an
impact. A Sight Through the Mist captures in liquid brush strokes a
distant ethereal view of the cathedral, whilst A Fleeting Moment is
designed in its abstract simplicity to portray the brevity of time and
the power of the building.

SENTIMENT towards the pound remained weak with dealers' attention
focused on the highly charged political atmosphere within the Tory
party, divided as it is on the issue of Britain's role in Europe.
Overseas investors are looking with mounting alarm at the
deteriorating political scene in the UK. If fears of a snap election
grow, then overseas investors may choose to dump sterling assets.
On Friday the pound to lost 0.7 of its trade weighted value and
continued its downward path yesterday, albeit at a slower pace.
The pound's value against a basket of major trading currencies dropped
by 0.1 to 87.8. Against the German mark sterling was virtually steady at
DM2.3887 but it was 0.25 of a cent adrift against the dollar at $1.5620.
Today's UK industrial production figures will be closely monitored for
signs of a slowdown in economic growth.
Elsewhere, trading was quiet. The dollar succumbed to mild
profit-taking in Europe whilst the Italian lira was supported by
comments that Italy will not cut interest rates in the near future.

In London, Carole Woddis sees a hit by a Scottish writer revived as
part of the Royal National Theatre's education programme.
YOUNG people these days are not at ease with whizzing through long
novels,'' says the National Theatre's head of education, Jenny Harris.
''They're off synch with reading.''
In an age of virtual reality and visual domination, it's perhaps no
surprise that teachers are in despair as to how to encourage young
people in the joys of reading. Which is why John Clifford found his
famous adaptation for Glasgow's TAG Theatre Company of Dickens's Great
Expectations on the Lyttleton stage last week, playing to 500 rapt
teenage London schoolchildren in a rehearsed reading with just seven
actors, two benches, and seven chairs.
''There's a real demand from teachers for this kind of work, that
dramatises novels and lifts them off the page,'' says Harris whose
policy is primarily to support teachers in their teaching of English and
drama but also to dispel the National's sometimes intimidating image.
''I think we ought to be opening our doors endlessly,'' she says.
''Theatres are treasure chests.''
Certainly the National's reading last week -- one of about three they
do a year -- was highly effective. Sensitively staged by Giles Croft who
is also the theatre's literary manager, it was also a far cry from the
original production in Glasgow in 1988. Clifford's original adaptation
came out of a collaboration between him, TAG's then director Ian Brown,
choreographer Gregory Nash, and the TAG company. It was a collaboration
that proved so successful it won The Herald's Spirt of Mayfest award,
set the company's style for the future while the production itself
subsequently toured all over the world.
''At the time,'' says Clifford, ''we wanted to try and combine dance
and drama which was a pretty revolutionary thing to do. We decided to
choose a familiar title and settled on Great Expectations because it was
so well known as a story. To begin with it was just bits of text and
dance set to music by composer Peter Salem and centred mostly round the
character of Miss Faversham. But by the end of the first week, we
realised the whole story was crying out to be told.''
Last week's version at the National was only slightly changed from the
final one produced for TAG which, says Clifford, involved some difficult
decisions. ''There were so many wonderful things that had to go, but
anything that stopped the story flowing ultimately was cut. The choices
were purely practical. It had to be not more than two hours.''
In the end too, Clifford decided to revert to Dickens's original
slightly ambiguous ending showing Pip left alone, rather than the more
upbeat conclusion favoured by Dickens's publishers who felt Pip and
Estella facing life together gave it a more commercial ending.
Harris and Croft believe Clifford has followed the spirit of Dickens's
intentions. Certainly, even without decor, dance, or any other
trappings, last week's reading was surprisingly emotionally powerful.
Expressing himself delighted, Clifford -- whose latest adaptation,
Wuthering Heights, can be seen this summer at Pitlochry -- naturally
hopes the National will go on to give Great Expectations a full
production.
As far as Harris is concerned, though, the series of four readings
have already served their purpose. ''One of the teachers wrote saying
how it had illuminated the text. I'd like to think that's what we're
doing, shining a bright light from page to stage.''

<HEADLINE>Wallis defends his #1.2m of share options</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979976312</RECORDNO>

THE chief executive of electricity firm PowerGen, who received #1.2m
last year in a share options deal, yesterday defended his salary,
saying: ''I think I am worth what I am paid.''
Speaking at the launch of the Pathfinder prospectus for the joint
National Power and PowerGen, Mr Ed Wallis was reluctant to comment on
the share option, but said: ''All I would say is that my pay is
independently set and I don't negotiate it myself.
''The pay and all the conditions have been fully disclosed in May of
last year so it will not be new to shareholders.
''Part of that remuneration is that the company has done very well and
the shareholders have done very well. Given that, I don't think I have
anything further to say.''
He did add that he had not cashed in all the #1.2m in share options
and stressed he had been told he owned ''a substantially larger number
of fully paid-up shares than other people in my position''.
He refused to comment when asked whether #750,000 was an accurate
reflection of the value of options cashed in.
Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, would say only that
he was confident the disclosures would not affect public interest in the
share offer to be launched on February 16.
Researchers at Income Data Services found that five of Mr Wallis's
fellow directors made profits of between #783,000 and #931,000. In all,
the six executives made #5,287,435 on share options last year.
They occupy six of the top seven places in a league table of 85 share
options analysed by the research company.
The findings re-ignited outrage over the earnings of privatised
industry chiefs and are certain to embarrass the Government.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, repeated his
demand for Government intervention.
1 Labour expressed their anger yesterday, claiming the power bosses
are set to scoop #23m in share options.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown published figures he claimed exposed
further ''corporate greed'' in the boardrooms of National Power and
PowerGen.
On top of the #5m the executives had made in share options, they were
due to reap #18m when they cash in their shares, Mr Brown said.
He urged the Government to crack down on boardroom ''abuses'' on the
day of the launch of the #4000m sell-off of the state's remaining 40%
shareholding in the electricity generators.
''The National Power and PowerGen corporate greed scandal is becoming
the most serious abuse of share options yet,'' he said.
A few directors who were already millionaires from previous pay perks
would become multi-millionaires at the taxpayer's expense.
''Six directors of National Power who made #1.3 million between them
in one week in November last year have #3.5 million more in profits to
collect.
Labour would be tabling amendments to the Finance Bill and Pensions
Bill to cut out these ''abuses'', although there is no suggestion that
the payments are illegal.
The Transport and General Workers Union have already warned a pay
claim on behalf of 3000 workers at PowerGen later this month will
reflect the huge boardroom bonuses.

IT is not too fanciful to claim that the greatest desire of Richard
Felix is to see Bonnie Prince Charlie installed on a plinth in Derby
Market Place, watched over by the police station. Once that aspiration
is achieved Felix can set about his second dream, welcoming the world
with its guide book and camera to the city he believes is England's
best-kept secret.
Over the bickering terrain of county tourism, Felix, an
entrepreneurial maverick, waves Derby's banner high and strong. But
there are those in commanding places who do not thank him for it. He is
47 and, until two years ago, was the proprietor of one of Derby's most
long-established music shops, a family concern which operated from the
market hall for generations. Now, as a result of his passion for local
history, he owns and runs the Derby Heritage Centre at the Tudor Grammar
School in St Peter's Churchyard which, in the sixteenth century, counted
among its pupils John Cotton, Pilgrim Father and founder of Boston,
Massachusetts.
''But does anyone out there know? Of course not. Because of
complacency, Derby is very poor at projecting its fascinating profile.
Did you know the last hanging, drawing and quartering in England
occurred in Derby? 1817, the Pentrich Martyrs, early Socialists, bread
for all, that sort of thing.''
As for Felix's Jacobite slant on things, we must retreat to the
beginning: Ever since he was a teenager suffering (but cured) from
Hodgkin's Disease, he was seized by an obsession for Stuart history. So
much so that, in a domesticated sense, Felix lives the Jacobite cause
through his Charles Edward Stuart Society. Upstairs in the Heritage
Centre, this most patriotic Englishman displays memorabilia, gained
through trawling auctions, of those three fateful days in 1745 when the
Young Pretender buckled his swash and marched his soldiers into Derby,
where he camped at Exeter House.
''Charlie's Army actually reached as far Swarkstone Bridge down the
road and only 120 miles from London. It was the southernmost point ever
reached by Scottish invaders. George II had his bag packed for Germany,
there was a run on the Bank of England, panic in the streets, and
noblemen were up all night burying treasure in the back garden.
Richard Felix's point in recalling all of this is because sometimes
commemoration makes for clever, intriguing tourism. ''Derby, we have to
recognise, was the crossroads of history. If Charlie had not retreated
from here the whole complexion of world politics might have been
different. This island might have stayed Catholic. We wouldn't have lost
America. There might not have been a French Revolution or a Napoleon,
and perhaps not even the First and Second World Wars.''
The problem is these speculative musings and their global sightseeing
potential have not yet set the city council's wits on fire. Felix has
plans to remember that December invasion 250 years ago with a specially
commissioned statue, requiring sponsorship to the tune of #40,000. He
also advocates souvenir plaques, and fireworks.
More spirited still, he intends to muster his Stuart Society, aided by
those fantasy warriors, the Sealed Knot, to re-enact the last slog of
the Bonnie Prince's march. Setting out from Carlisle it will take three
weeks to reach the Market Place where once the advance news of Highland
fighting skill and fierce emotions shook Derby burghers rigid.
''When the English force guarding Derby heard that the Scots were at
Ashbourne they buggered off to Nottingham and left the town to its fate.
Next morning two Highland soldiers came in and took the place. They went
to the George public house and demanded billets for 5000 men.''
The brilliant sparkle of this notion that pageant will pull the crowds
keeps Felix awake every moment, badgering all and sundry for support. He
is an engaging and accomplished individualist, but so far his enthusiasm
has met little besides indifference from the arts and tourism committee
of the Labour council. They are staging an offical Young Pretender
exhibition at the museum and appear to regard the Felix initiative as
overblown and meddlesome.
''They think the event is not really important since Charlie only
stayed here three days. But, bloody hell, come on! How long did King
John spent at Runnymede or the Duke of wellington at Waterloo or Richard
III at Bosworth Field?''
But now at least there will be official maintenance of the statue
Felix is commissioning from sculptor Anthony Stones. ''We'll have to
find the money for it through sponsorship but I've sweated blood on this
project and it's cost me a fortune,'' says Felix. ''I'm not giving up
the fight.''
To Derby people, however, he is a bit of a local hero himself. Felix's
Heritage Ghost Walks around the city are over-subscribed and, by most
accounts, more popular than Derby's official ''blue badge'' guides. And
now that his wife, Julia, a former catering lecturer, is overseeing the
Heritage Tea Room, scrumptious home-baking, eaten to live piano
accompaniment, proves a lure right through the day.
Is there a place in the Felix scheme of things for devolution? ''Well,
of course, the Scots never wanted the Union in 1707, and so I think if
they wish to have some form of home rule, then it should be their
decision. I'm a unionist, always will be, but as for Blair's proposal,
it's not a bad idea for the provinces in England to have power over
certain matters. It would let you know what was going on, what business
they were up to in the chambers.
An invader writes from Derby . . .
Letter from one of Bonnie Prince Charlie's soldiers:
Darby, 5th December, 1745
My dearest Jeannie,
I have ventured this by post, tho' it is a great chance if it comes to
hand. We arrived here last night admist the acclamations of the people,
and public rejoicing which we have had in several places, and we are now
within 100 miles of London without seeing the face of one enemy, so that
in a short time I hope to write to you from London, where if we get
safe, the whole of our story and even what has happened already must
appear to posterity like a Romance than anything of truth. I still
continue in good health as Mr Auckinleck and all friends to, thank God.
Make our compliments to all our friends and believe me ever to be,
Dear Jeannie, your affectionate husband,
Peter Ouchterlony.
* To Bonnie Prince Charlie, some imperial words of encouragement: all
Europe was astonished at the greatness of your enterprise for tho'
Alexander and other heroes have conquered with inferior armies, you are
the only one who ever engaged in such an attempt without any. --
Frederick the Great of Prussia.

MAMA, I Want to Sing is the latest in a long line of biographical
concerts, thinly disguised as musicals. This raucous biography of Doris
Troy would be more accurately titled Mama, I Want To Scream.
As a young girl Doris is an instant hit in the local gospel church
choir. She wants to go out into the world to find success with her own
pop group after a successful audition at Harlem's Apollo Theatre on
amateur night. Unfortunately her preacher-father has just died, in the
middle of an impassioned sermon. Her mother says no; Doris leaves
anyway. Having tasted pop success, our heroine returns to her church and
indeed to Mama. End of story.
All of this is narrated in tones of cosy, adoring intimacy by a radio
DJ (Joanne Campbell) from her own personal pulpit high up on the stage.
The singers are of powerhouse status. Doris Troy plays her own mother as
someone more formidable than Lady Thatcher and Lady Bracknell combined.
Chaka Khan is the choir's principal soloist -- an economy-size version
of Tina Turner with lungs to match. Charles Stewart is a galvanic
Minister of Music, marshalling his choral forces with conviction and
urging them on with St Vitus-like animation.
It must be pretty daunting to impersonate a star when she's actually
on stage with you. Yet Stacy Francis seems in no way put off. She gives
an extraordinary performance as Doris, revealing a voice of flexibility,
range and power. Mama, I Want To Sing may not be a musical in the
classical sense, it is however, a powerful and often exciting concert of
gospel and pop music.

NATIONAL Australia Bank, the parent company of Clydesdale Bank, has
made its biggest acquisition for five years with the $1550m acquisition
of Michigan National Bank in the US.
NAB, Australia's biggest bank and most profitable company, ended two
years of market speculation about its next major acquisition when it
announced the purchase.
''In the short and medium term, Michigan National should make an
increasing contribution to group profitability,'' NAB chairman Bill
Irvine said.
The American bank operates 191 branches in southern and central
Michigan, including the Detroit area, employs more than 4000 people, and
commercial business represents about 80% of the bank's lending book.

THE Scottish financial services sector, holding a conference in
Glasgow yesterday, has redoubled its efforts to stem the flow of
business to London.
Although Scotland's major companies currently purchase more than
two-thirds of financial and business services like accountancy and
corporate law north of the Border, many of those with a #50m-plus
turnover still head for the Square Mile.
Scottish Financial Enterprise, the private sector body which promotes
the industry at home and abroad, and government agency Scottish
Enterprise yesterday renewed their partnership in pushing the sector
forward.
Fred Shedden, senior partner of Glasgow law firm McGrigor Donald, told
purchasers and suppliers at the Why Buy Scottish conference: ''We should
not buy Scottish to fly the flag. We are asking you to buy Scottish
because we are as good as, if not better than, our City counterparts and
pound for pound we give you better value.''
Scotland's financial and business services industry employs more than
200,000 people and accounts for about 15% of gross domestic product.
The conference was chaired by Sir Iain Noble, chairman of corporate
finance firm Noble Group, and was addressed by Scottish Office Industry
Minister Allan Stewart.
Heralding the renewal of the partnership, Mr Stewart said: ''It is
good news for both organisations and important for the Scottish economy
as a whole.''
The financial service industry's key role in keeping company
headquarters north of the Border was highlighted. The partnership also
claimed credit for speeding up the impending launch of the Alternative
Investment Market in Scotland, which will help smaller companies raise
finance.

TO find such an intrinsically Scottish play hidden away in Wimbledon
is surprising enough. But to find also an English production being true
to its spirit is even rarer. Not having seen Ian Brown's original 1991
Traverse production of Bondagers I can't say how the two compare, but
Jenny Lee's production for her tiny, appropriately named Attic Theatre
would seem to me to pay full compliment to the richness of Sue Glover's
meditation on the agricultural women workers of the Borders in the last
century.
Lee's stylised but rumbustious production certainly captures the grit
of a story that could so easily have fallen prey to
over-romanticisation. Instead, while not flinching from its injustices,
Glover reminds us of some of the precious elixirs of life that
mechanisation has destroyed forever -- echoed in Alison Darke's
workaday, evocative designs: wooden beams and straw bales, hobnail
boots, heavy muslin skirts and, of course, scarved bonnets.
Like Brian Friel's Dancing at Lughansa, these women stomp and sing
their way through backbreaking privations with fervour and sometimes
melancholic beauty, eloquently evoked by lone violinist Timothy Myall:
Gaelic airs cleverly arranged by music director Gary Hume.
The measure of any production which relies so heavily on the community
it creates must though rise and fall by its actors, and Lee has chosen
wisely and well, her nearly all-Scottish cast are magnificent, led by
Isobel Nisbet's sturdy, stoic Sara, Andrea Gibb's fiery Tottie -- a
young woman thrown off course by sexual intoxication -- and Audrey
Jenkins as a sensitive but barren Ellen who married ''the maister'' but
is caught in the snares of economic necessity just all the same. A
memorable play and a memorable production.

Cracker's creator has now turned his sights on the desperate state of
secondary schooling. And, as Allan Laing warns, it will come as an
education to many
It's a universal story. It's not sensational; I think it is honest.
The system in this country is designed to fail 95% of predominantly
working class children
FACT one: English people with plummy accents can't say the word
''Jimmy'' without sounding patronising and condescending. Fact two: You
should never sound patronising and condescending to working class
Liverpool playwrights whose first name is ''Jimmy''.
The scene is the basement theatre in Channel 4's London headquarters.
The luvvie-darlings of the showbiz press have just seen a preview of the
first episode of Jimmy McGovern's new four-part serial about teachers,
Hearts and Minds, and the writer is answering their questions. The
phrase ''It's a cracker'' must surely spring to mind but, in the
circumstances, it is studiously avoided.
The first query comes from a journalist who is slightly concerned that
her wee tape recorder isn't working properly.
''Jimmy,'' she says. ''Do you think questions will be asked in the
House about this?''
''No,'' says Jimmy, somewhat nonplussed. Fortunately for the
journalist, it is a short enough answer not to need a tape recorder. A
simple scribbled note will suffice.
McGovern is right, of course. Questions will not be asked in ''the
House''. But they will be asked in houses. And in bars. And in the
streets. More to the point, they'll be asked in staff common rooms.
Hearts and Minds is a belter. A scorching drama serial, often funny and
always acutely-observed, about the desperate state of England's
secondary education system. Grange Hill for grown-ups.
It will be shocking but only to those sheltered souls who have never
experienced the problems of inner-city education. To the rest, it will
simply confirm what they have known all along. That years of Tory
mis-rule have belittled the teaching profession and made impertinent,
low-achieving, monkeys of our children.
Christopher Eccleston (from Shallow Grave and Cracker) plays a student
teacher who comes to the profession in his early 30s after working in a
car factory. He is an idealist, a man with the noblest of intentions,
who gets a placement in a tough Liverpool comprehensive. The series
charts his initial enthusiasm through to his eventual disillusionment
and indifference against the background of a school which is in the
process of opting-out. The message? The bastards eventually grind you
down.
McGovern, through his dialogue and his compelling and controversial
storyline, has the chaos and the anarchy of the modern school system
down to an absolute tee. Well, he should have. He was, after all, a
teacher before he became a writer.
There's a scene early on where a group of pupils find a -- what's the
word -- well, the word is a crap in the middle of the corridor. This,
says McGovern, is what happens when a school locks the toilets up to
stop kids doing things they shouldn't do. ''Where else are they going to
do a shit?'' he asks.
McGovern, now 45, admits that there is an element of autobiography in
the tale. A lot of the experiences happened to him. Others happened to
his colleagues. He was a teacher in a Liverpool comprehensive from 1980
until 1983.
''It's just an interesting story about an idealist coming in to
something he believes in and getting ground down by the system and along
the way I've tried to tell some home truths. It's a universal story. I
don't think it is sensational; I think it is honest.
''The education system in this country -- or, more particularly, the
examination system, is designed to fail 95% of predominantly working
class children. Teachers are so demoralised nowadays. There are times
when the staff room is a very depressing place. When I got out in the
Eighties it was pretty bad but it's even worse now.
''There's an awful lot of people who want to get out of the profession
but can't. They start off with so much energy and enthusiasm and
eventually they're forced to fall back on experience and technique,'' he
explains.
McGovern left teaching -- yes, he was disillusioned -- and went
straight into script writing, first for Brookside. The 80 episodes he
penned taught him his trade and provided him with the reputation for
being highly original and often controversial. He went on to write
Needle, a film for BBC2's Screen Two, and then came Cracker, the
creation of a monster.
Cracker, arguably the best drama series currently on television, is
that rare creation -- a programme which wins awards, makes news, and
attracts viewers by the barrel-load. The combination of the writer's
controversial scriptlines and Robbie Coltrane's performance is a match
made in heaven (or hell, depending on your point of view). It has made
McGovern the most sought after television writer in Britain. But all
along he has had this aching need to write a series about education.
''I always wanted to write this. In this country education is the only
place to write a Hill Street Blues -- that kind of busy, busy, business
of schools,'' he says.
McGovern is currently working on a third series of Cracker. The first
one is about a prostitute, he reveals, and (though he says it himself)
it is a beauty. He concedes that the last series was perceived to be
sensational but he did not set out to shock. To him it was just the
truth as he saw it. The flaws in the dark side of human nature.
Next month sees the release of Priest, his taut and highly-praised
film about a homosexual Catholic priest. It is further evidence, if
further evidence were needed, that he is one of the most courageous film
writers working in Britain today.
In Hearts and Minds there are the familiar McGovern elements of
violence but it is utterly believable violence. And it is not
overplayed. The luvvie-darlings of the showbiz press found it hard to
accept that it went on in schools. You want proof? Jimmy McGovern'll
give you proof.
''The worst thing that ever happened to me when I was teaching was the
night when Irene (his wife) and I were out walking and four kids from
school started shouting 'wanker!' at me. I ran after them and I caught
one of them. I wasn't rough with him but I restrained him and told him
to apologise or else he would face the consequences,'' he says, the
luvvie-darlings hanging on his every word.
''So the next thing that happens is he brings a guy who's built like a
brick shit house to my door to fill me in.'' And what did you do, ask
the luvvie-darlings, utterly captivated by the story.
''I shit meeself,'' he replies.
* Hearts and Minds begins on Channel 4 on February 16.

'Certainly there is quite a strong
argument for giving the regions
more say in their own affairs'
'It's knowing where to draw the
boundaries. Unlike Scotland, our
identity isn't culturally defined'
ANNE SIMPSON
gets more southern
views on Scotland's
aspirations as she
visits Derby on
her three-day
journey through
THE journey to Derby, the middle of England, began on one of those
oppressive days when the sky plonks on your shoulders, pressing you down
on yourself so that every step becomes a trudge. A nasty murk, just less
than fog, made even the countryside look grimy, but around
Northamptonshire the weather cleared enough to reveal fields smooth as
the baize for championship snooker.
Dead-eyed houses and bland industrial estates suddenly looked more
cheery, making the best of a puny sun. From the window of the train,
Bedford was over and done with in a glance. Then Welcome to Leicester, a
city full of surprises; the rail guard examined his watch and his
timetable. With some astonishment he announced we were 15 minutes ahead
of schedule.
As you approach the middle of England, the rhythm of speech fans out
to accommodate teasing cadences and patois. Not quite Yorkshire bite, or
Brummie whine, or the clipped imperatives of London, Derby's voice is a
bit of a nomad's memento, an oral luggage label of all the places a body
has lived in, all the territory crossed before coming to rest at
England's heart.
This voice may rise and dip with traces of surrounding county dialects
or carry the fractures of immigrant tongues. Our rail guard was a Greek
Cypriot who had lived in Derby for 12 years, after arriving first in
Croydon. He spoke English fluently but it was an English of his own
making and sometimes a little confusing. I asked him what he felt about
devolution: ''I do not believe in it myself,'' he said. ''I believe God
created man, and the monkeys are something entirely separate.''
We arrived at Derby in great, smacking gobs of rain. Hours later these
would flood much of the county and, further north, turn into snowstorms
of unremitting fury. But before we were totally under the weather's
siege I splashed my way around the city, first up Midland Street where,
even in a drenching, there is a cosmopolitan feel creeping in.
The European Inn is a new hotel about to open. An ''international
menswear shop'' has settled close to a minicab office where up on the
outer wall there still hangs an old, hand-lettered sign for a vanished
trader: Licensed to deal in game, fish, poultry and rabbits. Not far
from the Crown and Cushion there is a Greek taverna, and round the
corner in London Road more exotic taverns, a genuine French restaurant,
and a hotel with a name like a Verdi Aria.
Even on a brief encounter Derby seems gregarious, of the provinces
certainly but not shuffling beneath the taint of provincialism.
One of Derby's problems, though, is that it is a county town in the
middle of a country where boundaries of identity are not easily defined.
So would the Labour Party's proposal of devolved assemblies for regional
England help or hinder its sense of itself? David Robinson, newly
elected chairman of the CBI in the area, doesn't believe there is any
groundswell of support for Tony Blair's grand plan. ''But if Scotland
got devolution, then it probably should be considered for parts of
England. Certainly there is quite a strong argument for giving the
regions more say in their own affairs, yet I'm not sure another tier of
government would be the right way to go about it.''
That night Robert Jones, deputy Labour leader of Derbyshire County
Council, had a letter published in the Derby Evening Telegraph. The gist
was contained in the following: ''The main problems which are faced by
local government are that it has been systematically stripped of the
resources it needs to provide services, and its power has increasingly
been handed over to bodies and individuals who are not elected and not
accountable in any straightforward and open way.''
Here was that loathing for quangos again, that discontent worming away
at the English soul and now hardening into real anger not just among
those who knew how to exploit such rage for political gain but among
ordinary folk who, whatever their party, felt the system was being
rigged even more against them. I asked Robert Jones if English
devolution would help to restore the electorate's trust in public
officials: ''We would support Tony Blair's view of the changes which
need to be made but of course any plan for English devolution would have
to be seen to be workable.
''The difficulty for this area is knowing where to draw the
boundaries. Unlike Scotland, our identity isn't culturally defined. I
suppose middle England consists of Derby, Nottingham, Leicester, the
pottery towns around Stoke and, in the south, Northampton and a cluster
of towns around the M1. That's not a cohesive group, but we've noticed
in our dealings with the North-West that the Lancashire towns do have a
much stronger sense of regional togetherness.''
In Jones's long experience, however, the broad mass of people do not
bother too much about who is running local government provided adequate
services are properly delivered. ''If the dustbins are emptied and the
schools are well funded, then the public is generally satisfied.'' But
up and down the county there are constant grumbles that under this
Government adequate services have perished. The bins are brimming over;
the schools are in trouble.
Derby's sixteenth-century cathedral stands at the old heart of the
town but not entirely remote from the gulag architecture (circa 1960s)
of the Assembly Rooms whose sullen shadow also hangs over the Victorian
grace of the Guildhall. All Saints, a masterpiece with its metal chancel
screen and exquisite tower -- the second tallest of its period (1527) in
England -- accommodates the tomb of Bess Hardwick, erected to her own
design some time before she died in 1607. As the Countess of Shrewsbury,
she was highly distinguished for the building of Chatsworth House, and
''finished her transitory life . . . about the eighty-seventh year of
her age, and expecting a glorious resurrection lies interred beneath''.
And for Derby, a glorious resurrection? There are plenty of feisty
individuals who believe it could happen, must happen, none more so than
an admirable enthusiast called Richard Felix who, as custodian of the
town's Heritage Centre, believes Derby's vision of its future must
hallow its ancient past. But in its more recent history there are all
the familiar wounds inflicted by recession. In Robert Jones's
constituency of Normanton unemployment is around 30%. Twenty years ago
thousands would spend their entire working lives in railway engineering,
in the foundries and the pits. All that has gone and hasn't been
replaced.
On the first night of my visit, walking over pedestrian flagstones
from the Market Square, I saw a middle-aged man, modestly turned out,
checking through the phone booths for any overlooked loose change. He
moved so systematically about this task he might have been an official,
but he wasn't. And though he found nothing that night you sensed he had
struck lucky some time and would probably be back tomorrow.
Derby itself traverses with determined bustle. Between the station and
the Midland Hotel there is a steady flow of itinerant businessmen from
all corners of the country and abroad. Here Rolls-Royce has its
headquarters, and the traveller from Scotland cannot feel anything but
chagrin when learning that the Aero Engine Services division may soon
have Saturday and Sunday shifts added to its contracts. Meanwhile, the
wail of redundancy sounds at R-R in East Kilbride.
As the weather worsened snow seized up all tracks north so suddenly
the Midland was hectic with marooned professionals communing with their
laptops and demanding emergency accommodation. That night the gift of
tongues seemed to have settled on the dining room. At one table a local
civil servant told a group of engineers from Holland and France: ''The
sooner we cut out Westminster the better. Then we can start properly
interlinking with our regional counterparts in Europe. Don't be taken in
by all this Little Englander guff. It has never served us well in the
provinces.''
No Europhobia here then. Even the pianist's repertoire went beyond the
usual Two Spanish Eyes to take in a little light Debussy. Next day you
could gauge the measure of the weather's malice by the fact that Marks
and Spencers' sandwiches had not made it through the drifting snows from
Barnsley. At a butcher's in the Victorian market hall -- where they sold
a delicacy called slipper of pork -- the owner ruminated on the matter
of English devolution. Slapping a polony sausage on his scales, he said:
''It sounds a rum idea to me. He wasn't serious, was he, young Blair
when he said that? I took it as off the cuff, just to get him out of
some interviewer's tight corner.''
Earlier, there had been a report on the television news that racial
crimes in Derby had tripled in the past year, yet in my random inquiries
everyone consulted seemed mystified. There had been some trouble in the
early eighties, a doctor recalled, but recently she could remember only
one or two reported crimes and those had involved the wrecking of Asian
shops.
What people mentioned most was that Derby was proud to have an Asian
mayor, Nirmal Singh Dhinsa, and that most of its taxi drivers were
Asian. Sure enough, when I passed the station rank, there were five
Asian cabbies to two West Indians and one white. But only the Asians had
fitted their cabs with strong steel grilles closing them off from their
customers.
And so to Robinson Crusoe. At the Guildhall the Watson Players Amateur
Dramatic Society were celebrating their 25th anniversary with a
pantomime adaptation of Defoe's novel. It was a valiant if stumbling
affair: more noises off than on and too heavy in dialogue for the Cubs
and Beavers present. But there was a memorably wacky dame and some
nimble slapstick from the jolly tars. However, not even the best
prompter in the world could disguise the fact that the good fairy
Britannia had lost her voice to laryngitis and was now reduced to mime.
Next day, as I headed off through thaw and floodlands to Liverpool,
the memory of that hot and bothered mute Britannia kept recurring. Given
any regional shearing-off from Whitehall, perhaps it wasn't such an
inappropriate image. In a journey through disaffection, a flummoxed
Britannia might very well be a metaphor of sorts.

ENO's lustrous, profoundly moving version of Opera North's 1991
production takes the familiar story of the Iliad and strips it to its
emotional core. Everything turns on Priam's reluctant decision to kill
his infant son Paris who, it is foretold, will otherwise destroy his
father. Paris survives to steal Helen from the Greeks, and the rest, as
they say, is mythology: heroes killing each other, the sack of Troy, and
the final, unavoidable death of Priam.
Mythology is about man's powerlessness in the face of fate. In this
staging, by director Tom Cairns and lighting designer Ian Somerville,
the players are lost in an enormous, frightening world. Antiquity is
signalled -- a giant overturned amphora in the background of the first
act; the characters stepping out of a frieze on a shard of Greek pottery
in the second -- yet the dominant effect is determinedly harsh and new:
modern man can no more avoid fate than the heroes of Homer.
The gloomy colourings of this visually satisfying production -- purple
screens, glimmering fires illuminating battlefields, dim light
silhouetting a naked Priam begging Achilles for the return of his
favoured son Hector's body -- reinforce the dark forms of creation that
seal Priam's fate.
Tippett may favour bareness as a means of extracting an orchestra's
potential, but in the hands of conductor Paul Daniel his score remains
reassuringly familiar to those unused to modern opera. Andrew Shore's
Priam and Thomas Randle's angry Achilles stand out in a consistently
strong cast. But the seal of approval came from Sir Michael himself, 90
this year, who shuffled on stage to give a wave and brought the house to
its feet.

''THE sort of people you step over when you come out of the opera,''
said Sir George Young, former Housing Minister, commenting on the
homeless. Obviously there is as urgent a need today to cock a snook at
the high and mighty as when Bertolt Brecht and his merry band first
staged this play in Berlin in 1928 or as when John Gay penned The
Beggar's Opera, the original musical comedy on which Brecht's work was
based, in 1728.
The English translation by John Willett and Ralph Manheim returns the
action to a London setting and this production by final-year students at
the academy emphasises the timelessness of the story and the satire by
vaulting decades with each act from a colourfully seedy 1898, to the
gangland glam of 1928, to the corporate mores of 1998.
It's tremendously entertaining and doesn't pull its punches; director
Edward Argent combines a polished paciness with a rowdy anarchic edge
and the performers prove as quick-witted as they are well prepared,
turning the odd hitch into adroitly ad-libbed opportunities for yet more
laughter.
An orchestra of music students provide a crisp interpretation of Kurt
Weill's jagged score, while the leads bring out the acidity of lyrics
like ''The world is hard/and that's a shit/and that is all/there is to
it'' despite having voices like honey. Billy Boyd is outstanding as Mack
the Knife, Andy McCulloch has impressive stage presence as Peachum,
while Emily Hanrahan and Tracy Wiles are in fine voices as,
respectively, his wife and daughter, Polly.

THE title of Ecat's latest concert, Got To Be Hybrid, seemed to say it
all. On the platform were ensembles German and British. In the audience,
to hear their own works, were composers of similar background. There was
music live, music electronic, and music electronically live; and just in
case anybody failed to get the message, the opening piece by Wolfgang
von Sturmer combined what the programme-note called the ''cliches,
images, stereotypes, and other aspects of Heavy Metal'' with the strains
of a string trio.
But hybrid or not, what was remarkable about this concert was its
unanimity. This was music-making, by a sextet of young composers, with
freshness of voice, alertness of ear, and a determination not to take
life too seriously.
There were pieces with clever titles, such as Dietrich Eichmann's
Study No 403, and the music mostly lived up to them. Marina Adamia's
Science Fiction -- which was Ray Bradbury transferred to baritone sax,
cello, and piano -- was as atmospheric as you would expect from a pupil
of Edison Denisov.
Simon Atkinson's Touching Edges was science fiction of another sort
and Uwe Kremp's Hard Core, complete with recorded audience reaction, was
a creative piece of self send-up. As this pupil of Wolfgang Rihm said in
his programme-note, ''Just listen.'' It was advice applicable to the
entire concert, not least to Rebecca Saunders's vivid little string
quartet entitled Vermillion.

LAURA Ashley management blunders have meant that the retail group's
financial performance has not matched its world-wide reputation for
design. Its high cost base and North American retail business have
drained group resources.
Although the focus of the business has been tightened in recent years
under ex-chief executive Jim Maxmin, there is still some way to go.
This is recognised by the current management team under executive
chairman Hugh Blakeway Webb, who yesterday announced a #35m provision to
cover a variety of tidying-up operations.
Among the changes are the closure of the Bagley's Lane site at Fulham
in west London. Cutbacks are also envisaged in Boston, and Eindhoven in
Holland. Maidenhead is to become Laura Ashley's worldwide headquarters
with centralised functions of brand marketing, merchandising and
financing.
These measures will mean the loss of 200 management and administrative
positions worldwide, around half in the UK, by 1996. In addition, there
is to be a managed exit from small loss-making activities and the North
American store portfolio is to be rationalised, with a consolidation
where possible of garments, mother and child and home furnishing stores
into larger single units. The manufacturing operations are to be set up
independently.
Within the provision is #10m set aside for changes in accounting
treatment, reflecting the board's decision to adopt tougher accounting,
in particular on retail fixture depreciation and stock writedowns. This
is expected to reduce the group's base level of profitability by about
#3m.
Laura Ashley's management indicated when its interim results were
published last September that profits in the second half would be
adversely affected by the restructuring charge and that it did not
intend to pay more than a nominal dividend for the year.
Although logistics remain a problem for the group, its merchandise
does have appeal to a select group of consumers. Throughout its recent
problems sales have held up remarkably well. In the eight weeks to
December 24, sales in the UK and Ireland were 18% higher on a
like-for-like basis. In line with other retailers there was a strong
improvement in December.
However sales growth was more muted overseas. In Continental Europe
volumes grew by 7% but in North America growth was limited to 2% on an
underlying basis. However that was against very strong pre-Christmas
trading in 1993.
Commenting on the restructuring and trading performance, Mr Blakeway
Webb said that the board was satisfied with the trading performance of
the Group for the year.

AS befits a band whose music fits seamlessly on to the soundtrack of
Tarantino's Natural Born Killers, itself a kind of industrial/grunge
Armageddon, L7 are playing in a packed venue where condensation is
literally dripping from the ceiling -- the only appropriate setting for
their schizophrenic hybrid of punk, and grunge.
The large under-18 contingent in the audience who used the opportunity
to show off their pristine Nirvana T-shirts represent the grunge
element, but surely punk was never this together, so melodic and so
competent.
That L7 are so proficient may be down to their consistent touring in
the past five years, but it feels somewhat unsettling that the drummer
is dwarfed by her kit, and that their entrance is delayed for 15 minutes
to sort out technical problems.
The opening salvo of Everglade, Sanity, and Death Wish, do more to
authenticate their punk credentials: it is as melodic as it is furious,
and it takes the slower Stuck Here Again to show an occasional
songwriting skill.
They bear little resemblance to their obvious girl-group lineage --
The Slits and The Runaways. L7 owe more to the Go Gos if the latter had
taken as many narcotics as they claim to have. Indeed the Star Trek
convention that they shared a hotel with on Monday night seems a greater
source of inspiration.
Much of the rest of the set fails to maintain the momentum, carrying
an energetic if slightly perfunctory feel. Movie Star may be a warped
tribute to Johnny Depp, Monster is introduced as ''our Queensryche
tribute'', and only the sub-Zeppelin screeched dirge of Baggage stands
out as the hideously unappealing underbelly of what they are trying to
do.
Pretend That We're Dead takes its place near the end of the set, the
second best grunge anthem after Team Spirit, proving L7 to be slightly
more than the ''one-hit wonder losers'' to which they refer
sarcastically.

BRITISH Airways had a brilliant third quarter, with a 57% surge in
profits to #102m in the three months to December, well ahead of outside
forecasts.
But the shares edged up only 4[1/2]p to 374p on a warning from
chairman Sir Colin Marshall that yields were under pressure as a result
of strong competition.
BA arranged a timely increase in capacity just as demand is picking
up. Passenger numbers rose by 7% to 23.7 million but the all-important
yield measurement -- the average fare paid by each passenger for each
kilometre flown -- slipped from 6.63p to 6.43p. This was due to pressure
on fares, currency factors and a slow-down in the growth of business and
first class traffic.
The latter is vital for profitability and it grew by 6% in the three
months, down from 12% in the second quarter. In the comparable 1993
period there was an exceptional increase as the recession lifted.
High load factors are continuing and BA is maintaining its downward
pressure on costs, with the outlook for fuel prices improved by the mild
winter in Europe and North America. Unit costs fell by 1.5%. The
cost-cutting target for 1995 is #150m.
As for the future, Sir Colin commented: ''Prospects for 1995 remain
encouraging with continued strength in demand and gains in seat factor
in January.''
The group has decided not to write off its #258m investment in ailing
USAir yet because it still believes there is a chance it will pull
through. Sir Colin pointed out that it expected to have $200m in cash at
the end of March after the seasonally worst quarter and the company was
scaling back its operations to reduce costs.
''They are not on the brink and they are now working on this
restructuring plan to reduce the scope and size of the business and
operations which will lead to a smaller fleet and less people,'' he
said.
The cutbacks are not expected to affect the main hubs of Philadelphia,
Pittsburgh and Charlotte which funnel traffic on to BA transatlantic
flights under its marketing links which should be worth #64m to BA
operating profits in 1994/95. The two airlines are pressing ahead with
co-operative agreements to boost passenger numbers.
Of the group's other alliances, Australia's Qantas traded profitably
in the latest three months, while combined losses at TAT European
Airlines and Deutsche BA were slightly higher due to intense
competition. A decision by the Australian authorities on the proposed
amalgamation of the Far Eastern flight schedules of BA and Qantas is
believed to be imminent.

BRITISH investors have the opportunity, for the first time, to buy
shares in a property investment company specialising in the ownership of
modern, purpose built nursing homes that will be leased to leading
operators for periods of at least 25 years.
Nursing Home Properties (NHP) yesterday announced the placing of 15
million shares to be followed by a public offer of up to a further 15
million shares at 100p each to raise up to #30m.
In addition, it has arranged a debt facility of up to #25m through
National Westminster Bank.
Using these funds, NHP has conditionally agreed to acquire eight
nursing homes costing #16.1m and has arranged, subject to contract,
further acquisitions resulting in a total investment of #43.5m. All
agreed nursing home acquisitions will provide an initial rental yield of
at least 10.6% per annum on cost.
The private nursing home sector has grown strongly in recent years but
it still has enormous potential given the move from hospital care to
care in the community and an ageing population. Demographic trends in
Britain suggest that the population aged over 85 will increase by 64%
between 1991 and 2011.
NHP intends to offer shareholders a dividend yield well above the
market average as well as the potential for capital appreciation. The
company intends to distribute a total dividend, together with the
related tax credit, equal to at least 80% of its profits before tax.
The projected gross dividend yield for the first full year is 7.4% and
is expected to rise thereafter. This compares with estimated prospective
yields of 4.7% on the All Share Index, 3.9% on the SmallCap Index, and
5.2% for the UK Property sector.
NHP is modelled on the specialist quoted American companies known as
Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), which have expanded dramatically
in recent years. Health-care REITs' combined market capitalisation is
currently around $5000m compared to less than $1000m five years ago.
Following the offer, NHP intends to seek permission for the shares to
be traded under rule 4.2. The offer closes on February 28. The issue is
sponsored by Close Brothers Investment and Collins Stewart is the
stockbroker.

ALEX Salmond, MP, is leader of the Scottish National Party. Pause.
Well, it's about time someone made that clear. The past fortnight has
seen the most absurd and undignified squabbling among the nationalists.
The issue is devolution, and whether SNP MPs in the Commons should
support any devolution scheme advanced by a putative Labour government.
The issue is emotive. And, in the name of this issue, Salmond has been
the target of dog's abuse by many in his party who should know better.
Yesterday's man, Jim Sillars, has been disinterred from the attic to
set the young 'un straight. Iain Lawson, the thinking woman's
rat-catcher, has hurled insults at his party convener from that
notorious nationalist stronghold of Paisley. And assorted SNP
busybodies, the sort who sharpen dirks on curling-stones and who leaflet
Stornoway with filth, have hit the correspondence pages of our
newspapers.
All this has come about because Alex Salmond, duly elected leader of
the SNP in 1990, never challenged for that post, remarked recently that
the SNP would support any move towards Scottish home rule, even from a
heaven-cursed Labour Party, to gain a more effective platform for
advocating independence.
In this Alex Salmond merely advanced SNP policy, a position affirmed
as recently as the last party conference in September. Alex Salmond is
absolutely right. And, Alex Salmond is -- look, has the penny dropped
yet? -- the lawful leader of the SNP.
The wider party -- the nation -- are, then, entitled to ask what is
going on. Especially as we are no longer in the early eighties, when SNP
rows were a popular spectator sport, and the party had wandered so far
to the frontiers of irrelevance that double-figure ratings in System
Three polls excited great enthusiasm. This is 1995. The past year has
seen nationalist advances on many fronts, with bedrock support nigh
double that of a decade ago.
In the name of decent nationalists everywhere, then, I would like to
ask three elementary questions.
First, who does Jim Sillars think he is? He, too, had opportunity to
run for the SNP leadership. He ducked it. He, too, once -- twice -- had
a seat in Parliament, where he boasted of his insight into Labour
cunning and Labour depravity. He lost 'em. He, too, held various high
posts in the SNP. After the last election he quit them and marched off
in high dudgeon to make lots of money. No-one hears of Jim Sillars
leafletting in municipal by-elections. No-one has caught Jim Sillars
stuffing envelopes, or canvassing the streets, or otherwise tirelessly
advancing the nationalist cause. It would appear that, as far as Sillars
is concerned, his sole role in the Scottish struggle now is to divide
the SNP and belittle its leader.
Second, who do Iain Lawson and his associates think they are? They
have won no parliamentary seats. They run no district councils. Ten
years of vitriolic anti-Labour rhetoric in the Central Belt has seen
little more than the odd dent in the odd election. Lawson's brilliant
campaigning against British Steel -- executed with much verve and humour
-- failed to save Ravenscraig or even Gartcosh. Such men are scarcely in
a position to lecture Salmond on strategy, particularly when he has
built a strong SNP base in North-east Scotland, and beaten many Tories
into the bargain.
Third, how do these moaning minnies think a modern political party is
run? By playground rammy? This policy was endorsed by the party
conference less than half a year ago. Lawson and his buddies lost that
vote. They are under no obligation to defend it if they feel sincerely
unable to do so. But, as senior SNP spokesmen, part of the organised
leadership, they owe us all a duty to shut up and grant the party leader
the support he deserves.
Behind this, of course, is a myth and a little history. The myth is
that the SNP were clobbered in 1979 because they supported the Scotland
Act of the Callaghan government. In reality their setback lay in causes
more complex. There was the referendum debacle, and the iniquitous 40%
rule. There was a long, long debate on the Scottish question which at
length bored the electorate to death. There was Donald Stewart's
incompetence as a parliamentary operator, and beyond that the alcoholic
disarray of his Westminster colleagues as a whole. Finally, fatally,
there was Callaghan's ''winter of discontent'', and a national revulsion
against trade unions, the Left and all things radical.
In fact, blundering nationalists took the fall for the referendum
disaster. The Right blamed them for keeping Callaghan in office for too
long. The Left blamed them for bringing him down. The SNP failed to
exploit it all to their advantage.
Salmond knows that history, in these respects, is unlikely to repeat
itself. Future SNP MPs will be of higher calibre. They will be much more
uniform in attitude and policy. And Labour's commitment to Scottish home
rule gives a future Blair government far less room for manoeuvre; in any
event, Scottish Labour MPs today are pro-home rule almost to a soul.
Salmond has no interest in any myth of we-wuz-robbed. That is why,
despite his minor faults, he is a great politician, the first the SNP
has produced.
The history behind this tiff is petty and embarrassing. Salmond, like
President Kennedy, offended many of his peers in the SNP because he did
not wait his turn. The chance came for the party leadership, and the lad
quite properly seized it. A whole cabal of SNP high-heid-yins -- they
should have known better -- made prize asses of themselves by publicly
opposing him. Such as Jim Sillars and Kenny McAskill and Iain Lawson
publicly came out for Margaret Ewing. The SNP soldiers, with whom they
were completely out of touch, knew better. They knew that Mrs Ewing was
a fine woman who was not up to leading a political party. They preferred
being led by Salmond, a man they could watch and hold accountable, to
being led by a nice blonde whose strings were pulled by others.
The election of Salmond in September 1990 -- emphatic and sweeping --
cost these guys a standing in the SNP which they have never quite
regained. Some, for a time, stalked off in disgust and refused to hold
office or lead campaigns. Others, like Sillars, did their best to keep
control and frustrate the young pup's intentions.
Ironically, they did Salmond a favour. It was such as Jim Sillars and
Alex Neil -- author of the crazy ''Scotland Free By 93'' slogan -- who
were properly blamed for the 1992 humiliation at the polls. Again, in
1993 -- when the SNP group strung itself up supporting the Government on
a key Commons vote for a guarantee subsequently dishonoured -- Salmond's
luck held. Margaret Ewing, not he, is leader of the SNP at Westminster.
Alex Salmond has been in Parliament for almost eight years and led the
SNP for four. In that time he has been proved right more often than
wrong. Through setbacks and embarrassments, he has strengthened his grip
on the party and won the regard of Scots everywhere, as an able and
entertaining young statesman. In strange little ways he wins your
respect. To take but one example: in an age where politicians still
wield family like prize cattle, he has always protected the privacy of
Mrs Salmond, and refused to flaunt her as a political prop.
He is, in my experience, very forgiving. In all our experience,
Salmond presents the SNP case with logic, vigour and humour. He is
entitled to the support of all in the SNP leadership. It is high time he
got it.

COUPLES: Continuing her weekly series, Anvar Khan meets a Malaysian
'Prince Charming' and his Scottish wife.
THIAM and Maggie Lim met in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1975. Maggie was
19, Scottish, and a language student. Thiam was 22, Malaysian, born in
Butu Pahat, Johore, the city of the stone-throwers, but was working in a
rather more technical capacity for Mercedes Benz. Both were a long way
from home.
''We met in a multicultural club for young people,'' says Maggie. ''I
had been in Germany for about a month. I said 'Is there anyone who can
speak English?' and Prince Charming here said 'I do'.''
These first few words, uttered in desperation, became the backbone to
a marriage which has spanned 17 years and produced two children and a
successful business partnership.
Twenty years ago, in Germany, Thiam and Maggie were both equal
citizens, in the sense that they each belonged to a minority. Like many
people who choose to leave their country of birth and spend their most
formative years with another culture and race, they were each a tourist
and a foreigner. They were not maligned by the Germans, they just had
the feeling, subjective as it was, that to be anyone other than a German
was to be second-class.
''I remember a Scots guy who had been in Germany for years,'' says
Thiam, ''and when he married a German lady he changed his name to his
wife's maiden name. 'Don't call me Mr Graham,' he said to me. 'My name
is Kleiner'.''
Maggie was, at that time, more integrated than Thiam. She is bilingual
but Thiam had to take evening classes to learn German. ''It wasn't
easy,'' he remembers, ''staying in a country where you can't speak the
language.''
Claire, their first child, was six months old when they decided to
leave Stuttgart. Having worked for Mercedes Benz for 12 years, Thiam was
offered citizenship, but he was too disillusioned. In the bars and
restaurants Germans tended to serve other Germans first. This principle
applied to jobs too. Thiam couldn't get the management opportunity he
wanted. He decided to apply to companies around the globe, and was
immediately accepted by three motoring plants in Britain. ''One of our
reasons for leaving, '' says Thiam, ''was that Maggie would have had to
surrender her British passport.'' Maggie frowns. ''I wasn't prepared to
do that.''
Maggie does not believe that in order to achieve balance, you must
subsume your individuality. Thiam and Maggie have achieved harmony in a
mixed marriage by doing the opposite.
''I think it's very important that we all hold on to our identity,''
she explains. ''You're kidding yourself if you try to change for your
partner's sake. You are completely unhappy, you are not really yourself,
you're trying to be someone else to please them, and I think that will
never work in a relationship.
''We were aware from day one that we had been brought up differently,
but we accept one another. It's very different if religion plays a
strong part in a relationship. If you marry someone who has a strong
belief and tries to impose restrictions then that can be a big
problem.''
In 1984 the Lims arrived in Ayr, baby in tow. Thiam started his job as
sales manager with Glenn Henderson, now Caledonian Mercedes. Maggie
chose to stay at home with Claire. He spent four happy years at the
plant. Until, one morning, he realised that he needed to move on.
Maggie explains: ''He decided to do his own thing. We cooked a lot for
the friends we made in Germany. It just so happened we were speaking to
a friend about starting a food retail business in Ayr, and he said
'Well, I'm selling a business, are you interested?' We were in the right
place at the right time.''
The Lims bought their friend's shop in 63 Cambridge Street, Glasgow,
in 1987, which Maggie describes as then being ''functional''. They made
the necessary repairs, introduced new lines, and turned it into Lim's
Supermarket, catering for all cultural diets. The transition into
Scottish life has been smooth.
''We've been in Scotland for 11 years now and people have never called
us names. We're happy here, we've never had any racial problems,'' says
Maggie.
Thiam answers a constantly ringing phone, and queries from customers
speaking in Mandarin. No, he doesn't sell dried eggs. Yes, the dumplings
are to the right of the bottom of the fridge. The girl out front pops in
and out asking for singles.
The Lims attribute the ability to survive as a small business to hard
work. ''Having gone to a foreign country which doesn't speak your
language and being able to survive and get really good jobs, starting
our own business did not seem a big risk,'' says Maggie. ''If you feel
that fear to start off with, then don't do it, you'll not be a
success.''
The Lims have incredibly straight advice about how to settle into a
culture. As long as ethnic communities in Britain don't know how to
speak English, they will never integrate.
''If you want to migrate to a country, if you want to integrate into a
society,'' says Thiam, ''you must always learn the language. Our kids
speak English. It would be appropriate for them to speak a little
Mandarin but I would never force it.''
''Martin is six,'' says Maggie, ''and he feels 100% Scottish. Claire,
who's 11, describes herself as Chinese-Scottish. It's important to speak
a language to understand the mentality of a culture. Thiam was
English-educated, so that made it easier; he understood my sense of
humour.''
But integration has a hidden cost. Many mixed-race children cannot
communicate with their grandparents on their father's side. ''Claire
said she would like to tell her gran what she likes and doesn't like,''
Maggie sighs, ''but she can't.''

A MORE open approach to appointments to public bodies, including
advertising posts and giving reasons for why people get jobs, was
proposed yesterday by the Government.
Citizen's Charter Minister David Hunt unveiled the plans as he
acknowledged there was unease about standards in public life.
However, he rejected calls by Labour for membership of quangos to be
independently scrutinised amid allegations that too many people were
appointed by Tories, saying the decisions should stay with Ministers.
Mr Hunt, who will present evidence to the Nolan inquiry into standards
in public life today, said: ''At the end of the day, the buck stops with
the Minister and he or she is accountable. Appointments are for
Ministers to decide because they are responsible to the floor fo the
House.''
An 84-page report detailing the make-up of more than 1300 public
bodies was also published yesterday,, showing the salaries of chairmen
and members last year. More than 42,000 new appointments were made in
1994 -- 30% of them women.
It showed that 170 posts paid more than #50,000-a-year but omitted any
details of NHS trusts, one of the most controversial subjects in recent
months.
Mr Hunt told a London news conference that those applying to sit on
quangos should not be a ''list of the great and the good'' but
''public-spirited and well-qualified people.''
Posts should be advertised, especially the one-third of appointments
which are paid, and reasons for decisions on appointments should be
publicly announced.
Mr Hunt said -- in the Government's written evidence submitted to the
committee -- that there was no need to amend the regulations governing
the activities of former Ministers.
He said the rules -- which had been published by the Prime Minister --
made it absolutely clear that former Ministers must not do anything that
called into question their integrity or that of the Government. They
were sufficient.
Two former Cabinet Ministers, Sir Norman Fowler and Lord Younger, said
in evidence to the Nolan Committee last week that a time limit similar
to that affecting senior civil servants -- who take jobs with companies
they had been associated with in office, should apply to former
Ministers.
''Just because some outrageous allegations are made does not mean the
system should be changed,'' Mr Hunt said. ''That is not a good basis for
changing a system that has endured for generations past. Nothing could
be clearer than the rules set out in the code of conduct published by
the Prime Minister.''
There was no substance for the allegations so there was no need to
change the system. Britain's system of public administration was the
envy of the world in having the highest possible standards, and it was
the Government's determination to ensure it remained the best.
''I do not believe integrity is anything other than a very clear
concept,'' he said. ''I know of no evidence that former Ministers have
not maintained the high standards they maintaining in office on leaving
office.''
Lord Nolan later issued a statement describing Mr Hunt's evidence as
''a timely contribution'' to his committee's consideration of quangos.
''We have of course not yet had the opportunity as a committee to
examine it in detail nor to discuss it with witnesses from the
government and outside, but it is clearly a serious attempt to address
the concern which has been expressed by the public, particularly about
the method of appointment.''
THE Government yesterday challenged Liberal Democrat Lord Lester to
substantiate his reported ''cash-for-questions'' allegations against
four peers.
Lords Leader Viscount Cranborne was responding in the Lords to reports
that leading barrrister Lord Lester, who was not present in the Chamber,
had said in a confidential memorandum that he had been told of
''substantial sums'' changing hands in return for questions tabled to
Ministers.
In a secret submission to a Lords committee investigating the
financial affairs of peers, Lord Lester reportedly said money had gone
to four peers and ''several'' MPs, although no names were mentioned.
Lord Cranborne said he hoped that if there was any evidence to
substantiate the accusations, that the peer ''and what I understand to
be his professional clients'' would be able to substantiate these
allegations.
''Otherwise, I have to say that the reputation of this House risks
being blackened in the public mind without substance.''
Labour's Max Madden, MP for Bradford West, later disclosed he would be
asking the Commons Select Committee on Members' Interests to look into
Lord Lester's reported claims.

A POLITICAL row has broken out over the Government announcement on the
appointment of the chairmen for three new Scottish quangos which will
run water and sewerage services after April 1996. Here, Frances
Horsburgh, Local Government Correspondent, describes the careers of the
three men at the centre of the row.
DR IAN PRESTON
DR IAN PRESTON, aged 62, will chair the East of Scotland Water
Authority which will serve an area defined by the boundaries of the
present Borders, Lothian, Central and Fife Regional Councils.
Educated at Kilmarnock Academy and Glasgow University, he worked for
the former South of Scotland Electricity Board as a physicist and
engineer and then became director-general of the Central Electricity
Generating Board's generation development and construction division.
In 1983, he returned to the SSEB as deputy chairman and in 1990 after
privatisation became chief executive of ScottishPower. His salary rose
from #40,000 to #60,000 before privatisation to #255,000 in 1994.
Last November, he exercised some of the share options given as part of
his remuneration package from ScottishPower and made a profit of
#280,000 on which he would pay 40% tax.
Dr Preston, who is a CBE, has previously defended incentive share
option schemes as an incentive for people to improve the value of the
company which benefited the employees and also the customers.
He has also described publicity over greed and golden nest eggs for
top executives as ''emotional headlines.''
ScottishPower said yesterday that it had agreed to Dr Preston's
retiral being brought forward from July this year to the end of February
to enable him to assume his new role.
JOHN JAMESON
MR JOHN JAMESON, aged 61, will chair the West of Scotland Water
Authority which will serve the populations of the present Strathclyde
and Dumfries and Galloway regions.
He is a senior partner with the chartered surveyors G.M. Thomson and
Co based in Castle Douglas.
Born in Twynholm and educated at Rugby School and the University of
London, he worked for Shell first in London and then in Canada where he
joined Richard Costain (Canada) in 1958. In 1964 he retuned to the UK
and joined his present firm.
Although he is a member of the Tory Party, the urbane Mr Jameson has
always stood as an Independent councillor saying he believes party
politics are best kept out of local government.
He served as a member of Gatehouse of Fleet Town Council from 1974 to
1975 and as a member of Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council from 1974
to 1994. He was convener from 1983-1990 and is a former Cosla vice
president.
Mr Jameson, who has an OBE, joined the board of Dumfries and Galloway
Enterprise in 1991 and has been chairman since 1993.
JOHN ROBERTSON
MR JOHN ROBERTSON, aged 65, will chair the North of Scotland Water
Authority which covers an area taking in the boundaries of the current
Grampian, Tayside and Highland Region together with the three islands
councils.
He already receives over #14,000 a year as chairman of the Highland
Health Board and over #7,000 as a board member of Highlands and Islands
Enterprise.
Since 1980 he has been chairman of the multi million pound Robertson
Group of companies, the family property and oil distribution business
which includes interests in the Falkland Islands covering offshore
refuelling and oil supplies to the islanders.
Before entering the family business, he worked for the Anglo Iranian
Oil Company, later to become British Petroleum.
Born in Golspie and educated at Kirkwall Grammar School and Edinburgh
University, he has spent much of his time in Orkney where he chaired the
Orkney Health Board from 1983 to 1991.
Mr Robertson, who has been awarded a CBE, has held a wide range of
other public appointments in Orkney and the Highlands and has been
chairman of the Scottish Health Management Efficiency Group (Scotmeg)
since 1985.

Up to 60% of women with breast cancer in Scotland are not receiving
the best treatment available, according to a protest group. Jennifer
Cunningham reports.
THE stark statistic that seven women die from breast cancer every day
in Scotland sent a group of campaigners south to lobby MPs last night.
Today they will take a 150,000-signature petition calling for increased
funding for breast cancer treatment and research to Downing Street.
The discovery of the enormous variation in expertise and quality of
treatment and care for cancer patients not only between different parts
of the country and different hospitals, but between different doctors
has shocked patients and their relatives.
In Scotland, most of the women treated for breast cancer are seen in
general rather than specialist units. ''We believe up to 60% of women
with breast cancer in Scotland are being treated by general surgeons in
general units and that means that they are not receiving the best
treatment available,'' said Suzanne Wotherspoon, secretary of the
Scottish Breast Cancer Campaign.
David Miller, whose wife died from the disease, believes there is an
enormous need for specialist nursing and counselling services. He said:
''There are no nationally agreed guidelines for GPs about support and
treatment. The calls we have had from all over the country, but
particularly from people in more remote areas, have convinced us that
there is an enormous need for specialist services.
''Even the mammography service is insufficient because GPs do not have
sufficient expertise to pick up what is shown and they are missing
things.''
The campaign also wants more money available for specialist equipment,
much of which has been paid for by charity and fund-raising efforts by
grateful patients.
Betty Marvin, a sufferer from Hodgkin's disease whose sister died from
breast cancer, was so appalled by the lack of specialisation and
misdiagnosis she encountered that she set up the National Cancer
Alliance last April to improve standards to specialist level.
''We discovered that there were a lot of surgeons who just dabbled in
cancer cases. The NCA is compiling a directory of cancer specialists
because we think there is a critical mass -- that they need to deal with
a certain number of patients to maintain their expertise. It does not
guarantee brilliance but it does mean that they get lots of practice in
a particular procedure,'' she said.
Her alliance has brought consumers and professionals together in the
search for good practice and they have set up a group of specialist
surgeons who are currently defining what the minimum numbers of cases
should be. Mrs Marvin believes that many district general hospitals will
have sufficient patients to enable them to operate the system as well as
specialist centres as long as they are willing to nominate ''site
specific'' surgeons to operate on particular areas of the body. It is a
system which is being opposed by some general surgeons because of the
boredom factor of concentrating on only one area.
Just as important, according to Mrs Marvin, is the need to work within
a specialist, multi-disciplinary team with clinical and medical
oncologists with specialists in chemo- and radiotherapy treatments.
While the patchy nature of the system was publicly identified in England
and Wales last year, Scotland's geographical differences make it even
more difficult according to the members of the campaign, although they
agree that the specialist centres are excellent.
Glasgow has led the revolution in bringing all centres up to the best
standard in breast cancer care, according to Mrs Marvin, whose
monitoring network has the whole of the UK in its sights.
A system instigated by Dr Harry Burns, a public health official at the
Greater Glasgow Health Board, who retains a particular interest in
breast cancer from his days as a surgeon, has won general praise. It
involves one specialist from each hospital being nominated to deal with
breast cancer cases and also to meet regularly with his colleagues from
the other hospitals to audit standards and procedures.
Built into that system are specialist pathology and counselling
services. In effect it means that a woman with a breast lump who is seen
by her GP today could be seen by a specialist tomorrow at a hospital
visit which would include a mammogram and the removal of cells by a
needle for cytology. She should receive the results of the cytology
tests within hours and, if there is malignancy, have the treatment
options explained to her and go home with the date for her operation.
It is that standard which the campaign wants to be available to
everyone. They acknowledge that not every small hospital can employ
specialist staff but suggest that there could be a system where they can
collaborate with specialists and where more difficult could be referred
on to specialist centres.
They also want the generally successful screening programme to be
available to a younger age group. Many are relatives of women who have
died from breast cancer and among their pleas is a passionate one that
women whose family history puts them at risk should be screened
automatically.

Robbie Dinwoodie reports that Allan Stewart's walk in the woods may
have spoiled his chances of becoming Scottish Secretary, but he should
remain a familiar Tory face.
WITH the extravagant whiskers and a blue rose in his lapel, Allan
Stewart can come across as confident, colourful, and a little brash.
Clubable might be the phrase, if that's not too risky a term to use in
light of the confrontation with anti-motorway campaigners during which
he admitted picking up a pick-axe.
But the outward show of confidence can be misleading. He may bang the
despatch box with the best of them, and revel in baiting Opposition MPs
across the floor of the Commons, but close up he has always been a much
more nervous operator. Damp of brow, hot of collar, a slight tremble of
hand often marked his public performances. A professional politician, he
did not always give the impression that he was enjoying his job.
The foray into the M77 demonstration in Pollok Castle Woods by someone
who lives on his nerves therefore carried the risk of becoming
over-heated. Whatever happens next, once the procurator-fiscal has
considered a police report on the incident, it will probably spell the
end of any lingering thoughts among Tory activists in Scotland that Mr
Stewart might make it as Scottish Secretary one day, on a ticket marked
''Stop Michael Forsyth''.
It was an increasingly distant possibility in any case, for most
believed that having staged a memorable political comeback once after
being sacked by Margaret Thatcher, he had gone as far second time round
as he ever would. Indeed, that is one of the reasons why it has become
possible to mention the name of Michael Forsyth once again in polite
Tory society in connection with the Scottish Secretary's post, given
speculation that the present incumbent may move on to another Cabinet
post.
John Allan Stewart, 52, was educated at Bell Baxter High School in
Cupar, Fife, and studied at the hot-house of right-wing politics at St
Andrews University, where he graduated with first-class honours in 1964.
With the award of a Rotary International Foundation fellowship to
Harvard that year, a career in politics was clearly opening up before
him.
He returned to St Andrews to lecture in political economy for the next
six years and fought Dundee East unsuccessfully in 1970, and then joined
the Confederation of British Industry, rising to Scottish director in
1978-79, by which time he had already done a stint as a Tory councillor
in London.
He won East Renfrewshire in 1979 and found a comfortable home for his
free-market politics in Margaret Thatcher's new conviction-led Tory
Government, to which he was promoted as a Scottish junior minister in
1981. As a loyal Thatcherite he fought devolution and championed both
school opt-outs and the poll tax. For five years, he handled most briefs
at St Andrew's House, particularly education and industry, at difficult
times. The strain was beginning to show and what could best be described
as ''burn-out'' was looming when he was removed from office.
As he told The Herald: ''I felt that I was getting physically and
mentally tired. I said to my wife before the (1987) election 'This is
going to be very tough but I think we can hold Eastwood. But I give you
a guarantee, I'm not going back to the Scottish Office.''
In his second incarnation at St Andrew's House, in spite of the less
strident political culture of John Major's government, Mr Stewart has
not trimmed his support for his natural right-wing agenda, but he has
always managed to achieve this with a different style to that of his
political rival, Mr Forsyth.
According to Jackson Carlaw, a former vice-chairman of the Scottish
Conservatives and one-time chairman of the Eastwood constituency, his
strengths are in having ''a real personality and a recognisable public
figure. He has a clear understanding of the political direction the
Government should be moving in''.
He added: ''The difference between Allan and Michael (Forsyth) is in
their style rather than their politics. Allan, thanks to his CBI
experience, is a pragmatist. Michael Forsyth has more of a philosophical
approach to policy creation.''
He added that Mr Stewart felt very strongly about the importance of
the M77 to the constituency in terms of cutting road casualties and
traffic delays and felt rival politicians were hi-jacking the issue to
make false capital out of their green credentials. ''We have to wait and
see what happens concerning the alleged incident, but I would not regard
that as being in character.''
Another political ally of Mr Stewart said that second time round in
office he had enjoyed himself much more and television had highlighted
his performances in Commons debates. ''In view of the robustness he has
brought to the despatch box and the zest he has shown it is not
surprising that people have tipped him for higher office once more but
the fact is he does not have Cabinet aspirations.''
In any event, opponents claim he is too indiscreet for higher office.
In convivial company he is prone to saying things better left unsaid, at
least when some of those present might make use of unguarded remarks.
Had he not been a Government Minister he could well have joined the
Eurosceptics' rebellion.
Given the paucity of ministerial material among Tories north of the
Border and the likelihood that Allan Stewart would have dangerously
rebellious tendencies if sent once more to the back benches, this week's
incident will probably blow over and we will be seeing the whiskers and
blue lapel rose for some time to come.

A NEW Criminal Courts Rules Council to review the operation of courts
in Scotland is to be established, Scottish Office Minister Lord Fraser
of Carmyllie announced yesterday.
He told peers debating the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill that the
main function of the new body would be to ''keep under general review
the procedures and practices of the courts exercising criminal
jurisdiction in Scotland.'' It would cover the High Court, sheriff
courts and district courts.
In a clear move to ensure that people representing a wide range of
expertise are included, there will have to be one member with a
knowledge of the district court and one with ''an awareness of the
interests of victims of crime and of witnesses in criminal
proceedings.''
On the 19-member body there would also be two sheriffs, two members of
the Faculty of Advocates, two solicitors and at least one procurator
fiscal. It is likely that it would be chaired by the Lord Justice
General, though there is an option for him to nominate another member to
take the chair.
The Scottish Office pointed out last night that the establishment of
the new council was part of a widespread exercise aimed at improving
court procedures north of the Border and at addressing some of the
criticism aimed at the treatment of witnesses and victims.
During the Lords debate yesterday, a number of peers raised fresh
concerns that not enough was being done to safeguard the interests of
victims, but Lord Fraser insisted: ''One of a number of themes running
through this Bill is that we should be taking steps to improve the
position of witnesses and victims.
''We are very well aware that the rights and dignity of victims should
be safeguarded and are approaching the matter on a number of fronts.''
Labour protested about Government plans to seek to remove information
on court lists about the occupation of potential jurors, claiming this
could lead to ''imbalances'' in juries for major trials because jury
selection would be completely at random. However, the Labour amendment
was withdrawn.
A bid to remove a clause allowing questioning at judicial examination
to include questions aimed at eliciting admissions from the accused --
which the Opposition believed eroded safeguards for defendants -- was
defeated by 117 votes to 93, a Government majority of 24.
An attempt to reverse Government plans on changes to the right of
silence in Scottish courts, which will allow the prosecution, in
particular circumstances, to comment on an accused's right to silence,
was defeated by 106 votes to 71, a Government majority of 35.

THE public subsidy for the threatened sleeper service from Fort
William to London is #540 per passenger, Transport Secretary Brian
Mawhinney claimed yesterday.
He was urged by Liberal Democrat MP Charles Kennedy to meet
representatives of Highland Regional Council, who will be in London
tomorrow to lobby MPs on the future of the service.
Dr Mawhinney said he understood local concerns, but the subsidy for a
sleeper berth from the taxpayer was #180 a journey, excluding
infrastructure costs, and #540 per journey when the costs were included.
''Given those figures it does seem reasonable to me that in due course
there should be public consultation,'' he said.
Mr Kennedy said Dr Mawhinney had failed to respond to repeated
requests for a meeting. He said later: ''This is really disgraceful
behaviour on the part of the Transport Department. Assurances have been
broken, promises reneged upon, now ministerial acces is denied.''

SINGULAR THOUGHTS: lone parent Jean Sandison on life without father
ON January 26, 1993, I gave birth to a beautiful, intelligent daughter
whom I named Jessica-Ann Macgregor Sandison. At the age of 18, and
single, one might imagine that I had just made the biggest mistake of my
life. I mean, come on, who wants to be a single mum in the 1990s? No
money, no housing, and a bad reputation is a high price to pay for an
hour or two's pleasure.
When I had Jessica, I was living with my sister and her husband in
Northumberland. They were very supportive and helped me every way they
could. In return I made their lives unbearable; I was truculent,
demanding, selfish, and impossibly boorish. My parents were probably in
the safest place, spending the winter on the other side of the world,
working in Chile.
I felt so sorry for myself. My life seemed as though it had just
ended, rather than just started. I loved my daughter very much but I
felt trapped. My freedom had gone and for what -- a silly, irresponsible
teenage romance. Of course, it was everybody else's fault, not mine; my
sister, for having her well-ordered life; my two successful brothers; my
infuriatingly happily-married parents. It all seemed so unfair.
When my parents came back from Chile, Jessica and I returned home with
them to their small croft on the north coast of Sutherland. I
immediately put my name on the council housing-list. After nearly two
years it remains there. Our village is a small place, and I have taken
that into consideration, but a one-bedroom house did become vacant.
However, according to the council, this was not suitable for my daughter
and me. We were told that we required a two-bedroom house. So they gave
the house to a couple expecting their first child.
One advantage of living at home was that I had built-in babysitters.
And ''advantage'' is an understatement. I went out every night until all
hours. Parties, dances, rave-ups, extra cash whenever I needed it --
sounds great, doesn't it? So why did I give it up? I didn't; my father
did. His days of being a child-minder were well and truly over and
eventually, thoroughly exasperated, he showed me the door.
Back to Northumberland. After all, what are sisters for? Instead of
moping round my parents' house I moped at my sister's. Seven weeks later
she and her long-suffering husband had had enough. They showed me the
door. And that is when things really began to sink in. No home, no hope,
nothing. But I was lucky. I found a place to rent nearby. It was as if a
dream had come true and the most wonderful cottage I had ever seen; #50
a week, fully furnished, Laura Ashley interior, complete with cast-iron
spiral staircase, two bedrooms, bathroom, living-room, and kitchen.
Single parents can claim four benefits: housing benefit, income
support, child benefit, and family allowance. My housing benefit covered
my rent and my three remaining benefits amounted to #70.50p. I got by
and still do, although at times an extra #10-15 per week would make all
the difference. Nevertheless, I thank my lucky stars that I live in a
country which offers support to disadvantaged members of the community,
regardless of how they became disadvantaged.
Overnight, I felt as though at last I had become somebody, a
recognisable part of society. I started taking an interest in local
toddler groups, swimming groups, and other activities. Money was a
problem at times, but only because it was winter and my coal fire was
going through endless bags of ridiculously poor coal; but at least, and
at last, I was being me, and managing.
You probably wonder why I didn't claim maintenance as well. It was not
because I was unsure of who Jessica's father was, but paying #1000 for a
blood test to prove it seemed irrelevant; nor did I wish to have any
relationship with the guy who had deserted me. Jessica is all I need.
Perhaps one day she will have a father but, and believe me, he will have
to be a very special sort of person indeed, that's all I know.
I can't change what has happened and it is pointless worrying about
it. What is past is past and there's an end to it. Sometimes life is
hard, yes, I admit that, but I have Jessica and wouldn't change that for
all the benefits in the world. I love her. She makes the sun shine for
me on the dullest of days and is the best friend I have ever had. We
will grow up, together.

<HEADLINE>CBI will study impact of devolution on business</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979976337</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry is to look at the impact that
devolution would have on British business, Mr Howard Davies, CBI
director-general, said yesterday.
The CBI would be studying the role of the regions in public sector
decision-making and the involvement of business in those decisions, he
told the Newspaper Conference annual lunch in London.
One of the factors that had led to the holding of the review was the
current political debate on regional government, he said. The Labour
Party's intentions for England were still unclear, but it had proposed a
Scottish assembly with tax-raising powers and a somewhat less powerful
Welsh assembly.
Labour had also floated the idea of regional English assemblies and a
new, smaller London authority. Where the plans would end up was hard to
say.
''We think it right to put a clear business view to them before their
ideas for England are set in stone,'' said Mr Davies.
He added that there were potential benefits in structured regional
government, but there could be high costs. There was little business
enthusiasm for a new elected tier, but there was a growing consensus
that a regional focus for decision-making across the public sector
needed to be created.
It should be one with business input, and it was that proposition the
CBI intended to test over the coming months.
Although the Government acknowledged the need for a regional dimension
in policy-making, companies were confused about the regeneration budget
system, he said. ''General guidelines were drawn up in Whitehall and
then delivered to the regions to be implemented, but a lot of businesses
found that the responsibility seemed to rest somewhere between the two.
''Whitehall would refer them to the regions, and the regions would
refer them to Whitehall's guidelines. This meant that local businesses
bidding for money were not sure what they had to do to get it.''

A PROPERTY developer accused of hiring a hit man to murder or maim top
executives of a leading insurance company after a claims dispute was
cleared at the Old Bailey yesterday.
Father-of-three John Grainger, 53, maintained he was the victim of a
''dirty tricks'' campaign after suffering whiplash injuries when a lorry
went into the back of his car in April 1990.
The lorry's insurers -- General Accident -- accepted liability but did
not agree with his claim for #1m loss of earnings compensation.
They paid him #250,000 and got him to sign documents, thinking that
was the end of it, the court heard.
Mr Grainger claimed that because of his injuries, he was unable to
work as he had previously done, and was losing hundreds of thousands a
year.
But Mr Michael Austin-Smith, prosecuting, said the figures did not
back this, as the property market had crashed in the early 1990s.
Mr Grainger drew up a hit list of potential victims in the company's
Perth HQ, and southern England.
He had hoped that GA, not wanting the publicity, would settle with
him, the prosecution alleged. Mr Grainger was thwarted because the
police had been alerted by a man he first approached -- and the ''hit
man'' he later recruited was an undercover officer, said the Crown.
Mr Grainger, of Ridgewell Road, Great Yeldham, Essex, denied
soliciting to murder, incitement to cause grievous bodily harm and
incitement to blackmail. He was cleared on all charges.
He told the jury he suspected the informant was working for GA and it
was just another episode in what he claimed was a ''dirty tricks
campaign''.
''I am not a violent man. I couldn't live with violence,'' he said,
adding that he pretended to go along with wanting a hitman ''out of
curiosity''.
''I know they say curiosity killed the cat -- it certainly seems to
have happened to me -- but I wanted to see where this bloke was leading
me.
While accepting he had become ''obsessive'' about the case, he
maintained: ''There was no extortion plot. I was playing a role. I was
taking a part.''

DRUGS squad officers who sledgehammered their way into a house found
cannabis plants growing by a window, the High Court in Inverness heard
yesterday.
Officers obtained a search warrant for Mr Gary Follen's house at
Glenlia, Foyers, after packets of amphetamine were found by a track near
his home, the trial was told.
Mr Follen, 34, denies being concerned in the supply of amphetamine at
his house and elsewhere between January 1 and March 23 last year.
He has lodged a special defence of incrimination, naming Mr Allan
Wade, of Kanachrine Place, Ullapool.
Mr Follen also denies growing cannabis at his house.
Detective Sergeant Alan MacKenzie, 36, said that after the packages
were found one was returned to the spot as police mounted a surveillance
operation.
However, after several fruitless hours DS MacKenzie said suspicion
fell on Mr Follen.
Mr Follen was in the house, he said, when officers forced entry and
found two small cannabis plants growing, cannabis leaves in a pint
glass, and other items including a tin, brown tape, and black bin
liners.
Forensic scientist Christine Cranna, 37, said amphetamine-type drugs
could be traced in the bags she analysed and that parts of bags
discovered in Mr Follen's house matched bits missing from bags found
with the drugs.
The trial continues.

A BANNED driver who was involved in a fatal road crash the day after
he was disqualified for five years was jailed for a total of 15 months
yesterday at Arbroath Sheriff Court.
Eleven year-old John Williamson died when Steven Bracey's Ford Escort
car collided with a 38-ton petrol tanker on the A92 Abroath to Montrose
road.
Bracey's girlfriend Margaret Williamson, the mother of the dead boy,
was travelling in the passenger seat of the car while her five children
were in the back of the vehicle on October 5 last year.
Bracey, 28, of Wellington Square, Dundee, had earlier admitted driving
while disqualified, driving without insurance and two breaches of bail
orders.
On that occasion, Sheriff Norrie Stein said that John Williamson would
''still be alive'' had Bracey ''paid any attention to the order of the
court disqualifying him from driving''.
The court heard that Bracey had two previous convictions for driving
while disqualified and two previous convictions for dangerous driving.
Yesterday, at Arbroath Sheriff Court, Sheriff Stein jailed Bracey for
a total of 15 months and banned him from driving for 10 years.
He was jailed for 12 months and banned for 10 years for driving while
disqualified and received a further three months for two counts of
breaching bail conditions.
Bracey was also fined #300 with the option of seven days' imprisonment
for driving without insurance.
Bracey, who is unemployed, was also ordered to resit the driving test
at the end of his ban.
Sheriff Stein had earlier cleared Bracey of causing the boy's death by
dangerous driving when he ruled there was insufficient evidence.
The court heard that Bracey and Ms Willamson, 35, of Summerfield
Avenue, Dundee, had remained in contact since the collision, on October
5 last year.
Ms Willamson refused to comment as her boyfriend was led back to jail,
where he has been held since the accident.

HEALTH Secretary Virginia Bottomley is now unlikely to answer a
furious judge's demand for her to appear in his court to explain why a
pyschiatric bed could not be found for a ''very disturbed'' defendant.
South Thames Regional Health Authority yesterday said that Sharon
Towes, who pleaded guilty at Chichester Crown Court last week to
malicious wounding, would be admitted to a medium-secure unit within the
next two days.
Towes, 27, was appearing before Judge Anthony Thorpe at Chichester,
West Sussex, for the seventh time, and on each previous occasion he had
asked that she be sent to a secure unit.
Instead she has spent nine months in jail.
Judge Thorpe, who described Towes as ''very disturbed'', issued a
summons ordering Mrs Bottomley to appear in court on Friday to explain
''this sorry state of affairs''.
In two similar cases last year, judges threatened to bring Mrs
Bottomley to court but no summons was issued because the defendants
concerned were then found suitable accommodation.
This was the first time a judge had issued a summons for Mrs Bottomley
to appear but a Department of Health spokesman said yesterday it was now
''unlikely'' that she will be required to appear.
A South Thames RHA spokeswoman said that the RHA planned to increase
its secure beds from 104 to 176 within 18 months.

AN EXTRAORDINARY row was brewing last night between Highland Regional
Council and the Ministry of Transport over the fate of a pre-Christmas
letter from council convener Mr Duncan McPherson to Transport Secretary
Dr Brian Mawhinney asking for a meeting on Highland rail cuts.
Yesterday in Inverness, Mr McPherson and the Liberal Democrat MP for
Ross, Cromarty, and Skye, Mr Charles Kennedy, launched a week of action
over the future of Highland rail services which will focus on the
proposal to cut all Motorail services and the nightly sleeper to Fort
William.
Mr McPherson will lead a deputation of councillors and business
representatives from Fort William to Westminster tomorrow, leaving by
the threatened sleeper tonight. He told a news conference this was
necessary because of Dr Mawhinney's continued refusal to even
acknowledge a letter he had sent to him on December 21 asking for a
meeting.
Mr McPherson said he thought Dr Mawhinney's silence had been
''disgraceful'' and he was about to fax another letter urging him to
''show respect for the people of the Highlands by at least agreeing to
meet me at Westminster on Wednesday''. Mr Kennedy described it as
''gross discourtesy'' on Dr Mawhinney's part.
However, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport said: 'There is no
trace of this letter. We have asked the Secretary of State's office and
the people who administer invitations and letters to the Secretary of
State, and we can't find any record of it.''
Mr McPherson said last night: ''The Ministry of Transport did receive
the letter alright but they passed it on and have forgotten about it.
When I sent the letter to Dr Mawhinney on December 21, it was copied to
Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton who did acknowledge
it.''

THE BBC was accused last night of a cynical, calculated, and
inadequate response towards meeting demands for a less centralised
corporation more in tune with the needs of Scotland.
That broadside, by the influential Broadcasting for Scotland Campaign,
will be hammered home to MPs today as supporters arrive to lobby them
before Thursday's Commons debate on the BBC Charter.
Campaign chairman, Nigel Smith, yesterday ridiculed BBC assurances
that London domination would end after governors had welcomed the
Government White Paper last July which gave clear support to
decentralisation in programme making.
Mr Smith argued the BBC's immediate response to the White Paper -- a
plan to move production of #75m worth of network programmes from London
to English regions and Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland -- is
devalued because:
* #55m of network programmes have been centralised in recent years,
and #40m taken from regional programming;
* Contributions from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to UK
networks will only rise from 3% to 4.2%.
Mr Smith also said the pledge is greatly devalued because of the
qualifications that ''broadly'' a third of ''eligible'' programmes will
go outside London.
He added the BBC's response ''has been cynical, calculated and
inadequate . . . intended to meet the White Paper criticisms and to head
off further political pressure.''
A BBC Scotland spokeswoman made no reference to allegations of
cynicism and inadequacy, but stressed the corporation was committed to
making a third of eligible programmes outwith London, an increase of
#75m in productions.
She said real signs of that commitment would be on screen within a
couple of months, while a radio package would be announced later this
month.

<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>
<RECORDNO>979976345</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Government was urged by a senior Tory MP last night to mount a new
crackdown on illegal immigration into Britain.
Mr Winston Churchill said the official statistics underestimated the
real number of immigrants entering the country and he called on the
Government to ''come clean'' and produce the true figures.
He claimed that up to three times the official number of immigrants
were entering the country each year.
In a speech to the National Association of Conservative Graduates in
London, he warned that the size of the immigrant communities was leading
to a dangerous rise in racial tension.
Mr Churchill, MP for Manchester Davyhulme, said the official Home
Office figures showed that 50,000 immigrants were arriving in Britain
each year.
However, he said estimates by senior Immigration Service officials,
including former service chief Peter Tompkins, put the true figure at
between 100,000 and 150,000 -- about two to three times as high.
Their estimates were based on a calculation that the immigration
service catches no more than between 5-10% of illegal entrants each
year.
In addition, the disparity between asylum seekers arriving and
departing was more than 30,000 last year while the number of illegal
immigrants contracting marriages was 16,000 in 1993.
Mr Churchill said that as a result in the rise of the ethnic minority
community -- now standing at three million according to official figures
-- there had been a rise in racial tension.
''Given Britain's proud record of combating fascism, racism and
intolerance, it can only be a matter of great concern that racial
tensions should be rising here and that in the East End and in some
suburbs of London as well as in inner-city areas in the Midlands and the
North, people of all ethnic origins walk in fear of their lives,'' he
said.
He said the figures gave the lie to the Government's claim to be
pursuing a ''firm and fair'' immigration policy.
''The time has come for the Government to come clean on this issue and
to publish their own estimates of those who are entering and remaining
illegally and, in the interests, of racial harmony, to crack down firmly
on all such illegal immigration,'' he said.
His comments provoked an immediate outcry from immigrant groups.
Mr Claude Moraes, director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of
Immigrants, said Home Office figures tended, in practice, to err on the
high side.
Mr Churchill's comments would only add to the problems of racial
tension in the inner cities, he said, adding: ''It is very dangerous for
a politician to pluck figures out of the air for cheap political gain.
''His figures are basically wrong. They are not based on fact. Primary
black immigration to this country ended in the 1970s.
''We have now one of the lowest levels of black immigration in our
history. What there is, is almost totally related to family unity.''

THE man leading the hunt for raiders who stole gems worth #250,000
from the Queen's jewellers yesterday defended his officers against
criticism that they had taken five hours to discover that the robbers
had left the building.
Commander Tony Rowe was speaking as jewellers Garrard's said its
insurers were offering a ''substantial reward'' for information leading
to the conviction of the robbers and recovery of the stolen items, which
included a diamond tiara and other items which were the property of
Queen Sonja of Norway, the company confirmed yesterday.
Mr Rowe said his officers had responded to the alarm call within ''a
couple of minutes'' and had followed police procedures properly to avoid
any risk to the public.
They had been ''properly cautious'' yesterday in sealing off the area
around Garrard's in Regent Street, in the heart of London's West End.
He was ''not at all embarrassed'' by the police operation in which
more than 70 officers, some armed, surrounded the building, only to find
hours later that the robbers had fled.
''I would have been gravely embarrassed if they had escaped through
lack of awareness, or if a member of the public or one of my officers
had got shot because we were careless in what we did.
''We regret that we inconvenienced a lot of people yesterday, but we
don't close roads for the sake of it.''
Police had acted on information from one of the two security guards
kidnapped during the raid that the robbers could still have been inside.
''That is a good enough reason for us then to ensure that we protect
the public, that we protect officers and we do the very best we can to
arrest people without shots being fired, without death and without
injury. That is what we attempted to do yesterday.''
The delay in discovering the three robbers had fled was also because
officers had no previous knowledge of the layout of the jewellery store.
The blue Volvo car thought to have been used for the getaway had been
found in Farringdon Road in the City. He appealed for anyone with
information to come forward.
Garrard's managing director Richard Jarvis said yesterday the most
valuable piece stolen was a #200,000 late 19th century tiara.
It was among privately-owned items which had been sent to Garrard's to
be evaluated for renovation.
They and the other pieces, new jewellery belonging to Garrard's to be
shown to an international client, were about to be transferred to
Heathrow to be flown out of Britain when the robbers struck.
Neither of the security guards tied up in the raid had been physically
harmed and no one else had been hurt, Mr Jarvis said.

THE Enterprise Allowance Scheme, which has helped more than 6700 small
businesses get off the ground in Scotland, is to be wound up in England
and Wales at the end of next month.
In Scotland, however, it is going from strength to strength, sometimes
under different guises, as a useful tool in the armoury of Local
Enterprise Companies' efforts towards job creation.
Here, IAIN FLEMINGlooks back at how it started and has evolved.
THE Enterprise Allowance Scheme was originally set up in 1983 by the
Government as a way of massaging the unemployment figures and
legitimising people it suspected of working in the black economy and
claiming dole.
Designed at a time when the dole paid less than #30 a week, the
principle behind it was that someone could ''earn'' #40 a week from the
Government if they set up in business and came off the unemployment
register.
The allowance lasted for a year, but got off to a slow start because
it demanded the applicant either put up #1000 or have access to that sum
by way of a bank overdraft -- which ruled out many, particularly the
long-term unemployed.
Many who successfully applied in the early days were people who WANTED
to set up in business, rather than feel they HAD to as an alternative to
the dole, and it helped many fledgling businesses in their formative
months.
Over the 12 years, the allowance has not increased in value, so while
#40 a week may have provided for living costs then, it certainly does
not now.
The Government has decided that the funds previously earmarked for it
in England and Wales are now to be absorbed into a Single Regeneration
Budget, which will bring together the resources from some 20 formerly
distinct programmes for regeneration and economicdevelopment.
It will be up to English Training and Enterprise Councils (similar to
Scottish Local Enterprise Companies, but without the same level of
economic development powers) if they bid for that money for schemes
which may or may not include such direct support to new businesses.
The introduction of Local Enterprise Companies in Scotland, however,
has allowed them to tailor the scheme to meet local needs.
The amount and duration of the allowance is now at the discretion of
the LEC, which can also be more flexible as to eligibility criteria.
One of the first Local Enterprise Companies to tailor the scheme was
Ross and Cromarty Enterprise, which renamed it Business Start-up
Allowance (since copied by Scottish Enterprise in April 1993) and
widened the eligibility to include women returners to work.
Marketing Manager Len Johnson said: ''We wanted to help as many
sections of the community as possible, including women who had taken
career breaks and wanted to return to work, possibly through
self-employment, but previously did not qualify because they were not
claiming unemployment benefit.''
The LEC also introduced more flexible criteria for paying the
allowance.
A one-man (or woman) operation with a typewriter or computer, working
from home with few overheads, is likely to qualify for the basic payment
of #20 for 26 weeks, while someone else establishing a business
employing several people and with large overheads could get as much as
#90 a week for 66 weeks, depending on the circumstances.
In the Forth Valley Enterprise area, for instance, one does not need
to be unemployed and claiming dole, as applications will be accepted
from would-be entrepreneurs currently working under notice of
redundancy.
A condition of applying for the allowance here is that you must attend
a five-day start-up programme run by one of the three enterprise trusts
in the LEC's area, when trained business counsellors will help
applicants produce their business plan.
Chris Pepper, Assistant Director of the Stirling Enterprise Trust,
said: ''All that is needed now is a good business idea and a willingness
to train and produce a good business plan.
''And while you still need to be unemployed, that can only be for a
short spell and planning can begin while working under notice of
redundancy.''
The amount available under the scheme also varies from a basic #20 a
week, paid fortnightly into a business bank account only, to #90 a week,
depending on a combination of whether the applicant employs others, is
taking business premises, or where more than 60% of the business income
is coming from outwith the Forth Valley area.
An important element of the scheme is after-care support, in an effort
to reduce the large number of businesses that fail in their first year.
Jim Fairweather, Business Development Executive with Forth Valley
Enterprise, said:
''Although we reduced the minimum payment from #40 to #20 in some
cases, we beefed up the training support part of the programme and this
has given us a greatly enhanced survival rate, with 75% still trading at
the end of 18 months compared with a national rate of 70%.''

A YOUNG Scot will carry the concerns of her generation and help shape
Labour's future campaigns and policies after winning a place on the
party's national executive committee.
Miss Catherine Taylor, 21, a student at St Andrews University,
defeated three other candidates to gain a place on Labour's ruling body
with 61% of the vote.
Elected at the Young Labour Conference in Brighton last weekend, the
responsibility of Miss Taylor, of Wishaw, Lanarkshire, will be to
express the opinions and concerns of her peers.
She is studying geography and international relations, is a member of
MSF, the union for skilled and professional people, and president of the
university students' association.
Miss Taylor said: ''Young people are crucial to the future of this
country. The policies of this Government have hit them the hardest
leaving many without jobs, homes, or any prospects for the future.
''My priority will be to ensure that Labour's campaigns and policies
are relevant and attractive to young people.

A Professor, who himself skipped school, is in no doubt there is a now
a 'very significant problem, as DICK LOUDEN reports
TRUANCY is ''a very significant problem in some schools'', according
to Professor John MacBeath, director of the Quality in Education (QIE)
Centre at Strathclyde University.
He should know. QIE was commissioned by the Scottish Office Education
Department to produce the Truancy File, published last week along with
the national figures on school attendance and absence.
''Ten years ago, as with bullying, people would have claimed there was
no problem,'' says Professor MacBeath. ''Now no head teacher would say
that. The level of awareness has been raised and they all recognise
truancy as an underlying issue.''
He admits he himself was an occasional truant. ''I did it,'' he
acknowledges, ''for one of the most common reasons for truancy --
because some of my pals did it.''
The professor is convinced that some schools investigate absence more
rigorously than others, and accepts that the national statistics cannot
reflect this. ''How do you find out which children are at it unless you
invest a great deal of teacher time and effort?'' he asks.
''Even then, the distinction between condoned and uncondoned absence
can sometimes be far from clear. For instance, a school can accept an
absence as genuine where a parent has not, in fact, agreed to it.''
Professor MacBeath defines the biggest group of truants as those who
''feel that they get nothing, or very little, out of school.'' The
curriculum can be made to come to life. He recalls London inner-city
pupils studying Shakespeare on residential weekends at Sussex
University.
''They were so animated, so involved,'' he enthuses. ''They were the
proof that even the most disenchanted and disillusioned can be turned
on.''
His advice is that schools must start by identifying the ''at-risk''
group and monitoring their attendance through period-by-period recording
and spot checks.
The next step is to ascertain the reasons for irregular absence in
individual cases and to keep staff and parents fully informed.
There are also ''critical times of year when the rhythm of school life
produces peaks in truancy -- for example, Friday afternoons, before
exams, and before and after holiday periods. The school must not only
exercise vigilance, but also provide relevant activities at such
times.''
Thereafter the school should have alternative strategies available.
Some children will need support, others sanctions, others incentives.
''In some cases, support will mean behavioural or family support,''
Professor MacBeath explains, ''and a two-way flow of communication with
the home is essential. More commonly, however, it is learning support
that is required.
''With pupils who are school phobics, for whatever reason, a tough
approach may be the only way to bring them back in; but preparations
must be made to offer them a relevant experience when they return, with
the emphasis on a flexible curriculum.''
The Truancy File, which has now been distributed to Scottish schools,
is intended as a resource for teachers and school boards. An
attractively packaged set of materials, it has the advantage of being
both practical and succinct.
The File is organised into four sections, each introducing topics for
debate and offering exercises that encourage schools to evaluate their
own position in relation to truancy:
* ''Why truancy matters'' deals with its effects on the pupil, the
school, and the community.
It explains the legal rights and obligations of parents towards their
children, and highlights the costs of truancy -- resource costs in extra
support and materials; time costs in helping pupils catch up on missed
lessons and in parents taking time off work to visit the school; hidden
costs in diversion of guidance teachers' time, parental anxiety and the
bad reputation acquired by truants.
*''Getting a measure of the issue'' sets out the detailed
classification of authorised and unauthorised absence and the principal
reasons for truanting -- you don't like a subject or teacher, your
friends truant, you have forgotten an exercise, you find school boring,
or you can't be bothered going.
It suggests ways of tracking attendance patterns and invites the
school to use a pupil questionnaire and an effectiveness profile
designed to reveal how successful it is in meeting its attendance
objectives.
*''Causes and cures'' specifies the reasons why pupils may truant
regularly, e.g. to avoid being bullied, to avoid a teacher or subject,
or because they've got into the habit; why they may truant occasionally,
e.g. they haven't done homework, or have missed a bus and don't want to
go in late, or don't want exam results; why parents may keep them off
school, e.g. to babysit, to wait in for a tradesman, to do the shopping
for someone who is unwell.
It presents case studies and offers a range of possible remedies. It
defines the role that different agencies (social workers, police,
shopkeepers, etc) can fulfil, and invites staff and school board members
to review their personal school experience as a base from which to
understand the motivations for non-attendance and to identify which
solutions are most likely to work.
*''Making policy work'' looks at the major strategies available --
from support for learning to effective monitoring of attendance,
positive incentives such as merit awards, close liaison with parents, a
community approach, and local attendance councils -- and asks the school
to consider the best way forward in its own circumstances.
Professor MacBeath affirms that the Truancy File was not designed ''to
be issued cold to entire teaching staffs for reading. It has to do with
school policy and management.
''The best approach is for the senior management team to identify
issues of particular relevance to subject teachers, guidance staff, and
school boards, then make suitable arrangements to follow them up.''
The exercise is certainly worth initiating. ''Since head teachers are
only too conscious of truancy taking place in the under-life of the
school,'' says John MacBeath, ''they may welcome the File. There is no
doubt that, where a school takes planned initiatives, attendance can be
improved.''

CHILDREN'S welfare groups in Scotland yesterday voiced support for the
principle of an exclusion order for alleged child abusers -- rather than
summary removal of a child from the family home.
However, they believe it should be possible to implement such a
procedure immediately after a complaint is received by the authorities.
The Consortium for the Children (Scotland) Bill, which represents more
than 50 organisations, said it agreed an exclusion order -- which would
ban the alleged abuser from the home while an investigation is carried
out -- should be among protection measures available to the authorities.
However, it believes that to be effective the order must be part of
emergency protection arrangements and available at the first stage of an
investigation rather than later, as is proposed in the Government's
Children (Scotland) Bill.
The consortium was one of several bodies which gave evidence to the
Standing Committee of the House of Commons, sitting in Glasgow.
At the moment, local authorities invariably remove a child where there
is an allegation of abuse and the child needs to be protected.
However, according to the consortium, many children complain of
feeling ''doubly victimised'' because they have been removed from their
families as well as being abused.
Although some alleged abusers leave the home voluntarily, there is no
provision to exclude him or her unless they have been charged by the
police.
Some of the child law reforms proposed in the Bill, which is currently
going through Parliament, stem from the Orkney affair in which children
alleged to have been the victims of sexual abuse were taken from their
homes in dawn raids by social workers.
Lord Clyde recommended in his 1992 Report on the Orkney Inquiry that
''serious consideration be given to the introduction of a power to have
a suspected abuser excluded from contact with the child, obtainable on
application to the sheriff on the presentation of sufficient evidence''.
The consortium's written submission to the standing committee also
included a call for local authorities to have a duty to provide
assistance and guidance to young people who have left care until they
are 21-years-old, if they have been in local authority care at any time
after the age of 12.
The standing committee is due to take further evidence from Scottish
organisations and Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, Minister of State at the
Scottish Office, in Edinburgh next Monday before detailed scrutiny of
the Bill.

THERE are early indications that council tax bills in Edinburgh will
be limited to an average rise of #15 a house for 1995-96.
Edinburgh District Council's Labour leader, Ms Lesley Hinds, said
yesterday that the minority administration might be in a position to
propose a freeze on the council's share of the tax next year.
''I would stress this is only a proposal at this stage. We will be
consulting with both the business sector and local community groups
later this week and listening to their views before making a final
decision.''
The district council will use large cash reserves and the non-filling
of vacancies to help keep the tax increase to a minimum.
Lothian region's Labour leaders have indicated they want to keep their
rise to the inflation level of 2-3%, although no final decisions will be
taken until the beginning of March.
The region is struggling to keep its budget within Government spending
guidelines and is looking at increasing service charges, including
school meals and meals on wheels.
The present combined council tax for payers in Edinburgh of Band D,
which is taken as the average, is #813, which includes a water charge of
#78.

THE Scottish Universities Rectors and Presidents Group yesterday
condemned the Government's decision to abolish the mature students'
allowance.
The allowance -- which was worth up to #1045 a year -- was paid to
students who had earned more than #12,000 in the three years before
university.
The rector of Edinburgh University, Dr Malcolm Macleod, said the
decision made no sense at a time when the Government wanted more people
to enter higher education.
The president of Strathclyde University's student association, Mr Dave
Richards, questioned how the 73% increase in the university's mature
student population over the past two years could be sustained.

The company of which I am personnel officer is preparing to apply for
Investors in People status, but we are also interested in encouraging
our employees to undertake further learning of their own choice, without
necessarily wanting to obtain qualifications. Can you point us in the
direction of any companies which have followed this line?
A number of major companies have taken this imaginative step. For
instance, firms in the car industry such as Ford, Lucas and Rover have
operated initiatives under which staff select whatever education or
training they wish to pursue, whether related to their jobs or not. Some
employees have opted to study the languages of countries which they are
planning to visit on holiday, while others have preferred vocational
courses in such areas as word-processing.
Other companies such as Sainsbury's have adopted the Gateways to
Learning Programme initiated by the Employment Department. Under this
initiative, which will cover 70,000 Sainsbury employees by the end of
next year, staff receive career assessment and guidance then undertake a
course leading to a non-leisure based qualification.
Sainsbury's believes that the most cost-effective approach may be to
buy blocks of places from local colleges.
Experience shows that such schemes can enhance self-esteem and break
down barriers to learning and personal development. From a company's
point of view, the benefits can include improved industrial relations
and morale, lower turnover and absenteeism, the creation of a learning
culture and increased skill levels in the workforce.
What are Higher Education Funding Councils? Do they have a wider role
than simply dividing up the cake among the universities?
Many people see them as no more than the conduits through which the
Government channels the funds available for higher education. The
councils themselves emphasise a wider function.
They are required to advise the Government on issues in higher
education, have the power to allocate research funding to institutions
which they consider best placed to use it, are able to influence the
number of students each university and faculty can accept, and have
control over spending on capital works.
These days it is sometimes difficult to decide who actually controls
the universities. Their relationship -- not always comfortable -- with
the councils is one dimension. Their public accountability is another.
They also have their own governing bodies, whose reorganisation south of
the Border has caused much controversy.
The former English polytechnics which have become the new universities
proved to be a powerful pressure group. They persuaded the Government to
allow them to diminish the size of their governing bodies, with the
Education Acts of 1988 and 1992 enabling them to remove staff, student
and local authority members. Some of them now have small but
unrepresentative governing bodies, while the boards of the old civic
universities still have up to 70 members.
One of those which took advantage of the legislation was Huddersfield
University, which then proceeded to devise a retirement package of more
than #700,000 for its vice-chancellor. There was a public outcry and the
Higher Education Funding Council for England and the Public Accounts
Commission intervened to set the package aside. Clearly there is
something to be said for the councils.

Cumbernauld pupil's essay is a winner, as STEPHEN McGINTY reports
AN essay of bright ideas and bleak warnings has won Cumbernauld school
pupil John Paul Liddle, 15, the right to compete to stand in front of a
mock United Nations and preach a message of youthful creativity to the
world's jaded politicians.
And what ideas! Space stations and martian settlements that could
unite countries in a common cause. Giant cities orbiting the globe and
populated in peace by a mixed cultural group.
From the heavens John Paul's essay plunged to the depths where deep
sea communes would mine new fossil fuels and the sea's secrets would be
teased to the surface.
When asked to write about his hopes and fears for the 21st century,
John Paul's worries came to the foreground. Examining a world that is
fractured he predicts even deeper divides, a chasm between the rich and
poor, greater distrust between young and old.
But it was a comparison between dinosaurs and man that startled many
with a leap of logic clearing 65,000,000 years. John Paul examined how a
species that dominated all others could then die out. He now fears it
could happen again.
''Man has risen above all other species. We take more than our fair
share of the planet's wealth. We cut down huge rainforests and lay waste
to once-beautiful plains. We pollute the seas and the air. ''
''I fear that perhaps the other creatures, and the planet itself, will
not stand for it. I fear perhaps in the next century, even in my
lifetime, the human race will begin to die, just like the dinosaurs did.
'
'We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors. We borrow it from our
children.''
Tomorrow, the third year pupil from Our Lady's High will arrive in
London, the only Scot out of 12 winners and only days away from the
potential prize of representing Britain in New York at the United
Nations Of The Future.
That will take place early next month and will unite school children
from around the world in celebrating the 50th anniversary of the UN with
a series of debates on global politics. Two pupils will be picked from
the 12 winners after a gruelling but educational round of discussions.
Each of the 12 British prizewinners will be asked to explain their
dream UN of the future to a panel of MPs, MEPs and distinguished experts
in London, including Lord Ennals, President of the Gandhi Foundation.
John Paul is nervous but more than prepared.
''My idea is that the UN should find one thing that everybody can get
involved in. By working together they would learn about each other.
''I decided that the project would be to build a space station.
Everybody would learn from the process and the richer companies could
pay more than the poorer countries to fund it.''
A regular reader of The Herald, John Paul also enjoys watching the
news. Both his parents are psychologists, and though he will be
travelling alone, younger sister Elaine, 11, and brother Peter, 12, are
willing him to win. An admirer of Tony Blair, John Paul hasn't decided
yet between a career in politics or journalism.
He is a member of the school choir in which he often sings solo, a
requirement for modern politics, and his love of Sixties rock 'n' roll
practically guarantees his place in Parliament.
But he'll not decide until after university. Currently only one for
thing is for certain: his deep will to win and curiosity about the prize
that's already in the bag.
''I've been told I've already won a prize, but I don't know what it
is.''
And what would he like it to be?
''Money.''
Isabelle Boyd, assistant head of Our Lady's, is delighted with John
Paul's success. ''His work is very strong and the ideas are very
impressive for someone of his age.
''We're all very proud of him, and I think he will make an excellent
ambassador for Our Lady's, Cumbernauld, and Scotland. Also, anyone who
can stand up and sing in front of the school should have no bother
addressing the UN.''

THE Western Isles council is seeking more than #500,000 in extra
Scottish Office assistance to help pay for a #6.44m bridge which is to
link the 400 islanders of Scalpay with Harris by December next year.
Work is due to begin in April, but a council spokesman said yesterday
that a fresh approach was to be made for additional help with the
project, despite having already won more than #4m in European aid.
He added: ''We applied to the Highlands and Islands Partnership, which
oversees the Objective One programme, for a grant of 75%. Last month,
however, it agreed a grant of #4.186m towards the bridge. This was
obviously welcome but represented 65% of the cost. We are now asking the
Scottish Office if it can help with the 10% balance.
''The council will be paying the rest.''

TWO junior doctors yesterday claimed more than #4000 each in unpaid
overtime from the Raigmore Hospital NHS Trust in Inverness.
Dr Neil Maclean, 30, and Dr Christine Conner, 31, lodged their claim
at an industrial tribunal in Inverness under the Wages Act in the latest
of a series of such cases which are being backed by the British Medical
Association.
Both doctors worked in the hospital's gynaecology and obstetrics
department until August 1994. Dr Maclean is now working in Aberdeen and
Dr Conner in Glasgow.
They are arguing that, under a national agreement, their work pattern
should have put them into a higher overtime classification. The trust
paid them class three rates, half of the basic hourly rate. The doctors
say they should have been paid class two rates -- 70% of the basic rate.
Dr Maclean, of Garden Court, Bridge of Don, Aberdeen says he is owed
#4269, and Dr Conner, of Rosslyn Terrace, Dowanhill, Glasgow is claiming
#4434.
Dr Maclean and Dr Conner claim they rarely managed an eight-hour rest
period while working and therefore should have been paid at the higher
rate..
The trust will argue that the number and classification of additional
hours was a matter for local rather than national agreement.
Dr Maclean told the tribunal that, when he accepted a written offer of
a year's posting to Raigmore, he expected to work mostly normal hours.
In reality, he rarely got more than three to four hours' rest on
shift.
Dr Maclean said that, after new appointments failed to materialise, he
and his colleagues kept a diary for a month to document the intensity of
work, then approached the trust to complain.
Dr Maclean agreed with advocate John Wright, for the trust, that he
had never made a formal complaint and that the letter of employment
indicated the shift pattern and that he would be paid at the class three
rate.
The tribunal continues.

<HEADLINE>Partners in large legal firm deny system of overcharging. Lawyers accused of inflating advocates' fees when sending accounts to clients</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979976357</RECORDNO>

TWO partners in a large Scottish law firm have gone on trial at
Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with fraud.
Mr David Stevenson, 43, and Mr Lawrence Lumsden, 38, both deny
overcharging other solicitors when sending out bills.
Mr Stevenson and Mr Lumsden, whose addresses are given as c/o Robin
Thompson and Partners, Castle Street, Edinburgh, are alleged to have
overcharged a total of 13 times between December 1985 and May 1992 and
gained a total of #2673.09 for their firm.
Mrs Gaenor Stuart-Murray, from Kelso, told the trial that she came to
Edinburgh to work as a solicitor from one of Robin Thompson and
Partners' associated firms in England in January 1990.
Robin Thompson and Partners, which employs 50-60 people, specialises
in actions for compensation for industrial injuries and diseases, and
works for most of the major trades unions.
During such cases, advocates are often consulted and expert witnesses
asked to give opinions or examine machinery.
If Robin Thompson and Partners wins the case for its client the other
side has to pay the legal expenses for both sides in the action,
including the advocates' fees and charges for expert witnesses.
Mrs Stuart-Murray told the jury that, after winning a case, she
checked a bill which had already been sent out and found that the amount
asked for advocates' fees was more than Robin Thompson and Partners had
paid the advocates in the first place.
She sent a memo to the accounts department querying the amount, and
received a handwritten reply from Mr Lumsden which was shown to the
jury.
She explained that Mr Stevenson was the partner responsible for costs
and finance and that he was assisted by Mr Lumsden.
The memo from Mr Lumsden read: ''The matter which you raise is one of
practising policy in this office and can be discussed at a partners
meeting.''
''I felt pretty dreadful, my worst fears were realised,'' said Mrs
Stuart-Murray.
''Matters had been included in the account that we were not entitled
to include.''
Mrs Stuart-Murray added that an embarrassed-looking Mr Lumsden then
told her that he did not like the practice either, but explained that
the firm could get away without ever producing the fee notes from the
advocates for scrutiny.
''I felt the only explanation was that it was an attempt to inflate
the account of expenses by improper means,'' she said, adding that the
result was that Robin Thompson and Partners got more money.
When she later spoke to Mr Stevenson, he described it as a ''local
accounting practice'' before, she claimed, finally agreeing that it was
''technically illegal''.
He said he could understand that it was different from what Mrs
Stuart-Murray was used to in England, but added that bills were drawn up
that way as a way of negotiating with the other side over the final
amount to be paid.
Mrs Stuart-Murray said that when she did raise the matter at a
partners meeting she was told condescendingly by another partner that
what had happened was standard procedure and that bills were artificial
anyway.
According to Mrs Stuart-Murray, Mr Stevenson lost his temper when she
said that she was going to report the matter to the partners of the
English firms and she left the meeting.
She did go to some of the English partners, and some practices were
changed, but she was still not satisfied.
When, in defiance of one of the senior English partners, she sent a
full report to all the partners, her employment in Edinburgh was
terminated in early 1992.
She was to be offered a job in England, but she said that was
impossible and left the firm.
Mrs Stuart-Murray said that she then took her evidence to the Law
Society of Scotland which passed on the matter to the procurator-fiscal.
The trial, before Sheriff Andrew Lothian, continues.

PAULA COWAN investigates a new Israeli museuem
ISRAEL is a small country with five Holocaust museums. Should we think
this excessive, or is it as it should be in a nation committed to
remembering the Holocaust and Holocaust education?
Educators at one of these museums, Beit Lochamei Hageta'ot, the Ghetto
Fighters' House, believe that one important section of the public have
not been catered for -- namely, children.
That is about to change, however. Yad Layeled, the Living Memorial to
the Child, is located on the grounds of the Ghetto Fighters' House in
northern Israel and is due to open in April.
It will be the first Holocaust museum to have its main exhibit
designed for children aged nine and upwards. In Scotland, the Holocaust
is a theme which, when taught, is presented to children aged 10 and
over.
More commonly it is taught to primary leavers and secondary pupils.
How is the new museum, with such a serious, grim theme made suitable for
a young audience?
The answer lies in its content and presentation. The exhibits at Yad
Layeled concentrate on the experiences of children.
Through careful selection of children's stories and a presentation
using contemporary audio visual techniques, the museum creates a
conceptual experience of the Holocaust. It focuses on providing an
emotional experience rather than imparting information.
The museum's administrator, Chana Ginton, explains: ''Yad Layeled aims
to help children come to terms with the Holocaust without shocking them.
''This may seem a strange idea, but it's not impossible. For many
children of the Holocaust, the Holocaust was a terrible time but also a
time of excitement.
''For example, fathers often had no work to go to so had more time to
spend playing with their children. In the ghettos, children had
important jobs to do such as smuggling food. There was some fun
involved!''
Evidence from children's diaries and accounts suggest that the worst
period for the children who survived was not the Holocaust itself, but
the period after the war.
This was a time of desolation, when the children discovered they had
no parents and no home. The administrator continued:
''We want children to feel positive about learning about the
Holocaust, so that they will want to learn more about the period. Other
Holocaust museums in the country are aimed at an audience of 14 years
and over. Yad Layeled fills an important gap.''
It is likely that the presentation of Yad Layeled will be compared
with the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. The significant
difference is that the US museum presents a fictional story of one
victim; Yad Layeled uses only authentic material.
The museum comprises four elements; the Memorial Hall, the Korczak
Hall, the Eternal Flame Hall and the central exhibit, The Child in the
Holocaust Ramp.
The Memorial Hall consists of a series of stained glass windows
depicting drawings by children in Theresienstadt, the concentration camp
set up by the Nazis as a showpiece for Red Cross officials.
Korczak Hall remembers Polish writer and social worker Janusz Korczak
(1879-1942). Korczak, head of a Jewish orphanage in Warsaw, could not
tell ''his'' children of their fate. When served with their Nazi
deportation orders, he told them they were going to the country for a
picnic.
At Treblinka concentration camp he refused a last minute offer of
freedom in return for abandoning his charges and went with them to his
death. His work and philosophy are shown in an animated film and graphic
sequence.
The Eternal Flame Hall hosts paintings by the renowned Israeli artist
and Holocaust survivor, Moshe Kuperman. Here screenings of stories of
children's rescue will be shown.
The Child in the Holocaust exhibit consists of a circular ramp with
recordings of children's stories that are accompanied by visual scenes
and images. Death is only implied, not graphically shown.
The exhibition starts at the time when restrictions and bans were
first imposed on Jews and ends at the end of the war. This section is
totally cut off from the outside world. The ramp has been designed so
that there is only one light entering from skylights near the ceiling.
Before leaving the museum, children will be encouraged to visit the
activity rooms. Here they will be able to reflect on what they have seen
and use freely available art materials to express their feelings.
This work may, in time, produce a separate display for the museum.
These workshops will also provide children with a time for discussion
before they return to the real world.
It is hoped that Yad Layeled will become an international centre for
research and development of Holocaust curricula for young children.

DETECTIVES are hunting a youth who used a stolen car as a ''weapon''
to murder its 77-year-old owner.
Mr Robert Inchcliffe died in Middlesbrough General Hospital early
yesterday. He suffered multiple injuries when he was run down as he
tried to stop the theft of his car from his drive in Newark Road,
Hartlepool, on Saturday night.
A murder hunt was launched yesterday and Detective Chief Inspector Ray
Mallon, who is leading the operation, said: ''It would be very difficult
to put into words my feelings about a crime like this.
''This is much different to the usual situation of joyriders who steal
cars regularly and place innocent lives in danger.
''We have a youth here who used this vehicle as an actual weapon. It
is absolutely disgraceful.''
Mr Mallon said the police would ''leave no stone unturned'' in their
search for the two youths who escaped in Mr Inchcliffe's car.
He explained only one of them was in the car when it was reversed into
Mr Inchcliffe. The other got in when it stopped further down the street.
The Inchcliffe family were said to be ''devastated'' by the tragedy.
Mr Inchcliffe, a grandfather, was a retired County Durham miner who had
been married for 53 years.

LABOUR has slipped back from a 10-year high in The Herald/System Three
polls, down three points from last month's peak of 57% with the spoils
shared evenly among its political opponents.
Labour's performance last month, giving the best result for more than a
decade and opening up a gap of 35% over the SNP in second place, was
seen as a performance which would be difficult to repeat.
So this has proved, with Labour support falling back to 54%. The
rivals climb by one point each: the SNP to 23%, Conservatives to 12% and
the Scottish Liberal Democrats to 10%. The Greens remain on 1%.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said: ''We are satisfied
with our long-term performance -- consistently scoring more than 50%
consolidates our position as the top political party in Scotland.''
He rejected the analysis that the drop represented the first signs of
the impact of internal battles over Clause 4, rail re-nationalisation
and private education, which marked the end of Tony Blair's honeymoon
period as leader but came too late to influence our January poll. ''I
think any honeymoon period was over a long time ago and we are now at a
solid, consistent level of support,'' he said.
SNP chief executive Michael Russell said the party always did best at
times when it could campaign on the streets and feature in the press.
''In the last fortnight that has certainly been true and over the next
few months we shall be doing more and more of both,'' he said.
''The effect of that will be to continue and accelerate the rise that
this poll indicates. As I predicted last month, Labour support is past
its high tide and is heading for 'High Noon,'''
The Tories also discerned signs of a change in fortune for them.
Scottish party chairman, Sir Michael Hirst, said: ''This indicates that
the public are beginning to see the stark truth behind the cosmetic
facade of Labour policies. I would expect to see further erosion of
their support in the coming months when the hollowness and inconsistency
of their programme becomes even more apparent.''
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Jim Wallace said the upward trend
over the last three months in his party's support was reassuring, with
local elections only two months away, but they knew there was
considerably more work to be done.

Fife programme offers new training opportunties for a return to work,
as SUE COUTTS found out.
ONLY five per cent of Scotland's working women are self-employed,
which is just half the proportion of their English sisters and only
56,000 out of a female population of around 1 million.
However, this sad state of affairs could be set to change, especially
for the women in Fife, through a seminar to be held on February 15 at
the Queensferry Lodge Hotel.
Women into Business is a course run by South Fife Enterprise Trust,
which is funded by Fife Enterprise.
The idea is to increase the number of businesses set up by women in
the Fife area, where at present women represent only 25%-30% of
inquiries to the South Fife Enterprise Trust.
The course format is geared around a one-morning briefing session for
women interested in running their own business, and from this between 12
and 15 will be recruited.
This is then followed by an eight-day training programme over a period
of eight weeks, backed up with individual counselling and a support
network.
The new female push is aimed at those aged between 30 and 40 who have
gone through a career break. They will have some professional or
technical expertise and be interested in exploring the potential for
self development.
Topics to be covered include: * WHAT is involved in setting up a
business
* WHAT kind of person succeeds
* AND a case study by a successful local business woman.
The training programme consists of business planning, sources of
assistance, market research and marketing, managing your business,
employing people, finance, presentation skills, and assertiveness
training.
The course will close with a presentation of business ideas to a panel
of professionals.
Here, participants will not be able to sit back; group work
discussion, case studies, and role play will be a major part of the
briefing.
Linda Fitzsimmonds, course director and director of South Fife
Enterprise, said: ''The programme will be highly participative, with
formal input, group work, and discussion, case studies and role play.
''Participants will be encouraged to have at least three sessions with
their individual counsellor, and may choose to meet them on a weekly
basis between training days to support them in the business planning
process.''
She added: ''I think it is vital that would-be female entrepreneurs
have role models to learn and take inspiration from.
''While everyone knows about the Ann Gloags and the Christine Lattas,
their experience can sometimes be just too remote.
''We need to show that women can run successful businesses, and have a
home life, without necessarily becoming superstars.''
With this thought in mind Fitzsimmonds has brought together a number
of strong case studies.
The first is Margaret Oliver, who launched Platform Arts and Tourism
Management last year. She felt her knowledge gained from 20 years as a
self-employed potter and artist showed where there was a space in the
market place.
However, Margaret also felt that a brief foray into event management
made her realise that while she had ''hands-on'' experience of the arts,
an understanding of the principles of management was the gap in her
knowledge.
''Clients were talking about strategy, and I didn't feel that I quite
understood what they meant.''
This was solved by an intensive MSc in Tourism management at Napier
University in Edinburgh and guidance from Fife Enterprises New Venture
course.
Margaret's enthusiasm for her new career has now driven her business
to the point where she is taking on a full-time assistant.
Currently, Platform is involved in co-ordinating activity for the Fife
aspect of this summer's Tall Ships Race starting from Leith.
Margaret plans to maximise Fife's tourism industry to the
opportunities offered by an event of this size.
Other projects for the company include the Dunfermline Jazz and Blues
Festival and a directory of the arts in Fife.

THE emphasis on results in the new National Health Service appears to
be incompatible with the role of hospitals in the training of young
doctors, the principal of Glasgow University warned last night.
Sir William Fraser, who presides over one of the country's biggest
training centres in the Glasgow Medical School, used the prestigious
Lock lecture to tell his audience at the Royal College of Physicians and
Surgeons of his misgivings over the changes sweeping through the NHS,
referring in particular tothe formation of trusts.
The old system of clinical training for medical undergraduates used to
be a joint operation between university and hospital, dependent on a
''largely informal understanding'' between both institutions as to the
cost of shared facilities and shared teaching, but this is now being
replaced, he said.
This ''financial reticence'', where the precise cost of such
arrangements to each party is not known, clashes with some of the
''totems of the modern NHS'', which he identified as a predilection for
league tables, ''notional returns on capital'', performance-related pay
and cost competition between individual trusts.
''Nor, I venture to say, does medical education sit easily with these
concepts'', the principal added.
One consequence of the burgeoning number of NHS trusts he also
identified was an increase in bureaucracy.
The question of who is responsible for what in the training of young
doctors has now become crucial given the plans, both in Edinburgh and
Glasgow, to close major teaching hospitals and build anew on different
sites, he added.
Sir William then called on Scottish Secretary Ian Lang to ''knock
heads together'' to sort out the funding responsibilities, and in doing
so, avert the scenario of a trust refusing to assist the training of
young doctors because of financial considerations.

UNION negotiators last night predicted massive support for strike
action among Clydesdale Bank staff after talks with the company failed
to settle a pay dispute.
Discussions between management and representatives of the Banking,
Insurance and Finance Union went on for five hours yesterday at the
bank's head offices in Glasgow. But union leaders later rejected a
revised offer as ''totally inadequate''.
Lead union negotiator Keith Brookes said the bank had offered to add
0.42% to an earlier 2.5% pay and performance offer linked to extended
working hours. He described the new offer as ''far from acceptable'' and
pointed out that the bank had made a profit of #110m in its last
financial year.
The bank's management had refused to move at all on the performance
bonus scheme, which the union viewed as arbitrary and divisive.
Mr Brookes, Bifu assistant secretary, added that the bank had
indicated that up to 10% of the staff might get no increase at all.
The union is urging its 4000 members in the Clydesdale to vote in
favour of a series of one-day strikes. The result will be announced
tomorrow.
Bifu's Clydesdale committee will meet on Thursday to consider the
outcome of the talks and the ballot result.
Mr Brookes said: ''We have every confidence there will be an
overwhelming vote for strike action.''
The union had indicated its willingness to continue talks with the
bank either directly or through the Acas conciliation service, he added.
Mr Leif Mills, the union's general secretary, said: ''I am
disappointed that the bank has failed to respond to the strong feelings
of staff.
''We made a genuine attempt to translate that feeling into a
substantial improvement in the pay offer. The ball is now in
management's court.''
A Clydesdale Bank spokesman last night said the revised offer
represented an overall 3.13% increase in the salary bill. The package
would mean that staff with a performance that was ''fully satisfactory''
or above would get increases ranging from 3% to 7%.
The proportion of staff who would not benefit under the package would
certainly be less than 10%, he said.
The spokesman added: ''We had a very full day of talks. The union will
no doubt be considering its position and we will be considering ours.''

I AM thinking this morning of Lewis Grassic Gibbon, great literary
light of the twentieth century, who so changed my life in the course of
a day that I have remained for ever in his debt.
Having grown up in the same rural corner of Scotland, I had failed to
grasp the rhythms and flavour of that distinctive life, which had seemed
to me no more that a grey existence of sweat and drudgery.
Failed, that is, until the day of my youth when I read his remarkable
Sunset Song, which suddenly opened my eyes to the deeper beauty of that
life which surrounded me; opened my ears to a land which now seemed to
have a voice of its own.
What's more, those revelations came in a language I had never
encountered, for the simple reason that Grassic Gibbon created a new
form of expression. What a master! How did he do it?
Curiosity led me to examine the style, working backwards from the
actual words to the thought process which produced them -- and then to
marvel at the way he arranged the vocabulary.
Of course the secret remained hidden within his genius but his style
has been influencing writers ever since.
I felt a fresh excitement about life, a new enthusiasm for pursuing
the career of journalism in which I was still far short of confidence.
In this new-found exuberance, I set about finding out as much as
possible about the man who wrote this extraordinary story of rural life
in North-east Scotland.
The first discovery was the brevity of his life. In fact the reason I
write of him now in particular is that he died 60 years ago today,
before he had even reached his 34th birthday.
Bothered with stomach pains, he went for an ulcer operation. But
peritonitis had set in and he failed to rally from the operating table.
Like many another Scottish writer, he had burned himself out in the
scramble for survival.
Lewis Grassic Gibbon was the pen-name of Leslie Mitchell, a crofter's
boy who was born in 1901 at Auchterless, on the edge of my native
Buchan, before the family moved over to the Mearns, south of Stonehaven,
when Leslie was eight.
To my delight I found that his old headmaster at Arbuthnott School,
Alexander Gray, was still alive, by then in the 1950s back teaching
Greek at Drumtochty School.
Together we walked the red clay of the Mearns as Mr Gray told me of
the studious 12-year-old who wrote in an essay: ''What an irresistible
feeling of power comes when on a calm clear night you gaze up at the
millions of glistening worlds and constellations which form the Milky
Way. 'Tis then, and then only, that one can realise the full power of
the Creator and the truth of the wild dream of the German poet. There is
no beginning, yea, even as there is no end.''
From a 12-year-old! No wonder Mr Gray still had the essay book. His
pupil had gone on to Mackie Academy, Stonehaven, showing signs of the
wayward genius and leaving much before his time to become a reporter in
Aberdeen and then Glasgow.
Joining the Army in 1919, he managed to pursue his passion for
archaeology with a posting to the Middle East, later joining the RAF
around the same time as Lawrence of Arabia. Back home in 1925 he married
his childhood friend Rebecca Middleton, from the neighbouring croft at
Arbuthnott, who was a civil servant in London, and they settled in
Welwyn Garden City.
His first novel was published in 1928 and in the seven remaining years
he published no fewer than 17 books. But it was Sunset Song in 1932
which brought him international fame, followed by Cloud Howe and Grey
Granite to complete the trilogy known as The Scots Quair.
There you felt his love-hate relationship with the land, expressed
beautifully in a classic which nevertheless appalled even his father and
mother with its frankness and earthiness. Their disapproval greatly
saddened him.
I came to know Grassic Gibbon's widow and still treasure her letter
from those early days when I was trying to spread the gospel. At that
time, incredibly, his books were out of print, a fact which distressed
her.
On moving to Glasow in 1960, I continued to piece the picture together
by getting to know the author's brother, John, who lived near the Kelvin
Hall, and later his daughter Rhea, a brilliant academic who became dean
of her faculty at the Hatfield Polytechnic.
The big breakthrough came in 1970 when the BBC televised Sunset Song,
with Vivien Heilbron playing his memorable central character, Chris
Guthrie. More than a generation after Gibbon's death, Scotland began to
pay attention to one of her greatest sons. His books became part of the
''Highers'', alongside Scott and Stevenson.
Hugh MacDiarmid hailed Gibbon as Scotland's greatest novelist since
John Galt, ''just getting into his stride, with the best yet to come''.
But fate dealt that cruel blow and they brought his ashes back to
Arbuthnott Kirkyard, where the gravestone bears those moving words from
Sunset Song: The kindness of friends, the warmth of toil, the peace of
rest.
And to think Lewis Grassic Gibbon could still have been with us. What
an incalculable loss we suffered -- 60 years ago today.

THE daughter of Scotland's biggest winner in the National Lottery
slipped and broke her ankle while celebrating on Sunday.
Mrs Joanne Birrell, 26, whose mother Mrs Jean Scott won #796,183, was
dancing through the streets of Bishopbriggs in the early hours with her
husband Davie after a champagne celebration with her parents and two
sisters. She slipped and her husband fell on top of her.
She insists she hadn't had a drop of alcohol, but says from now on she
will be drinking only champagne.
Mrs Scott, 53, an account executive at Harper Collins, said: ''She
hobbled over to our house on Sunday afternoon, and I eventually took her
up to hospital.''
When asked if her daughter would now be going to a private hospital,
Mrs Scott replied: ''No way.''
Her husband, Bill, 54, a painter made redundant from Yarrow a year
ago, said: ''We don't agree with it.''
Mrs Scott discovered she had won while watching the live TV show on
Saturday. By the time the bonus ball dropped, Mrs Scott had five numbers
and was one of four people to win such a major sum.
The family's plans as yet do not extend past new windows for their
Bishopbriggs home -- that and an appointment with their bank manager.
* A couple who thought they had won a share of a #10m lottery prize
were brought down to earth hours later -- when their nine-year-old
daughter admitted she filled in a ''winning ticket'' as the numbers were
drawn on TV.
Mr Dave Cleal and wife Sandy, of Portsmouth, Hants, were too
embarrassed to talk about the incident which saw them going down to
their local to celebrate.

CABINET Minister Jonathan Aitken was reprimanded by Government
colleagues last night after a serious weekend blunder undermined the
Prime Minister's authority.
Mr Aitken unwittingly encouraged nine Tory rebels to remain in exile,
just as Ulster Unionists are threatening to bring down the Government.
The crime of Treasury Chief Secretary Mr Aitken was to reopen in
public the Cabinet divisions on Europe. He trumped Mr Major's ace speech
last Friday night to Tory Euro sceptics. At Ministerial meetings
yesterday, Mr Aitken's blunder was the high point of discussions.
On Friday night, the Prime Minister offered yet another concession to
his Tory Euro rebels by indicating Britain would not only veto European
political and monetary integration but also put up new arguments against
a single currency. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke is scheduled to itemise
these later this week.
However, at the weekend Mr Aitken declared on TV: ''I don't want to
see a single currency -- period -- for as far as I can possible foresee.
I would hesitate for an eternity before I came out and said I would vote
for a single currency.''
This exploded a carefully contrived campaign by Mr Major to unite his
party. The Euro rebels were saying last night that the longer they stay
off the Whip, the more they achieve.
This hits Mr Major at the most delicate time in his negotiations with
Dublin on the future of Northern Ireland. Some of the nine rebels and
more Tory back benchers are severely cynical about his conduct of the
Irish negotiations.
Mr Aitken's blunder on Sunday morning breakfast TV was excused by
friends at the Commons last night as a slip of the tongue before the
cameras. He has apologised to Mr Major for this personally on the phone
yesterday -- but the damage had been done.
Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook immediately demanded a General
Election on the grounds of what Mr Aitken said about the single currency
in Europe because, he claimed, the Cabinet is hopelessly divided on the
issue. Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown seeks next week in the
Commons to devise a motion on the European issue that he hopes will
bring the Tories down.
The Aitken blunder was being seized on as further evidence the Prime
Minister cannot control his Cabinet on both the European and Irish
issues at this critical time.
President of the Board of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine, found it
necessary to tell the nation on Sunday -- after the Aitken intervention
-- that the European argument within the Tory party was getting out of
hand. He declared he would not ''pander to the whim of anti-European
public opinion''. The Government, he said, must dismiss the ''politics
of frustration and nostalgia'' and concentrate on winning the best deal
for Britain at the 1996 summit, even if concessions had to be made.
Behind the scenes at Westminster last night, a furious Mr Major was
privately fulminating about the Cabinet indiscipline. He was saying to
colleagues that if he is to be further undermined in this way, it makes
it difficult for him to keep the Irish peace process alive. Today, the
Prime Minister will discuss with Mr Clarke, how the European policy can
be put back on the tracks when the Chancellor spells out in some detail
future negotiating policy.
The internecine Cabinet dispute on the airwaves is damaging to Mr
Major not only in the preparations for European negotiations but, more
urgently, the life-or-death matter of producing a London-Dublin deal to
bring the Ulster Unionists together with Sinn Fein and the SDLP to start
negotiating a permanent peace solution.
Yesterday, Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew met Ulster
Orangemen to explain where the Government stands in talks with Dublin
following the furore caused by a leak concerning all-Ireland joint
institutions.
The Orangemen emerged from the meeting to say if such cross-border
institutions were left in the hands of a new Northern Ireland Assembly
they would be content. Spokesmen for the Loyalist paramilitaries
declared they too would be content.
Mr Dick Spring, Ireland's foreign minister, made clear yesterday his
government wants the framework document on the future of Northern
Ireland to be published by the end of this month.
Mr Spring, in Brussels for a meeting of foreign ministers, announced
he would meet Sir Patrick on February 14 for further negotiations.

I am pleased to hear that in December Strathclyde Regional Council
accepted the plan for the Glasgow CrossCity rail link. I hope the scheme
is completed as soon as possible. However, I am concerned about the
proposal for a new Bridgegate station, linked by travelator to Argyle
Street station, as I feel it will not allow the scheme to reach its full
potential.
A travelator is a second-best way to provide an interchange. It
reduces the number of passengers who will make use of the interchange,
owing to the increased time and hassle involved. The Queen Street to
Buchanan Street travelator is a perfect example.
A better solution would be to reopen Glasgow Cross station, for which
the chamber is in place under Trongate, and provide a proper interchange
with a new Glasgow Cross high-level station on the CrossCity line. As
well as improving the interchange, the station would be in a prominent
location, improving useage.
Argyle Street station would be closed, as it is too close to Glasgow
Cross. This would be a more expensive solution than that proposed, but
the same thing was done in the late 1970s at Partick. The old Partick
station was closed and a new station constructed above the refurbished
Underground station. The reasons for doing this at Partick were sound. I
consider the reasons for following the same course at Glasgow Cross to
be just as sound. A proper interchange strengthens both lines.
If this project is worth carrying out, it is worth carrying out with
the proper interchange at Glasgow Cross.

A GAMEKEEPER awarded #14,350 compensation for being unfairly dismissed
was yesterday evicted from his house on a Highland estate.
Mr George Dey, a father of two, had to move with his family from the
house where they had lived for 18 years on Strathspey Estates, near
Grantown-on-Spey.
They are now in accommodation for the homeless awaiting a council
house.
Mr Dey, 45, was sacked from his post as head deerstalker -- which he
had held for 21 years with the Earl of Seafield and his son, Viscount
Reidhaven -- for slashing a tyre on a suspected poacher's van.
He took his case to an industrial tribunal, which ruled in December
that he had been unfairly dismissed and awarded him cash compensation.
But he was not reinstated and this month the estate won a court order
to evict him from his tied house.
The Deys had to be out of their house at Balnacruie, by Boat of
Garten, Inverness-shire, by noon yesterday.
Mr Dey, who has been unemployed for more than a year since his
dismissal, claimed that he had been exonerated by the tribunal verdict
and that his former estate bosses had been ''spiteful''.
He said: ''I have been in a tied house and they say they need it for
another employee -- but at the same time they are renting out properties
not a mile from here.''
Mr Dey, his wife Mary and grown-up children Brian and Morag, decided
not to try to fight the eviction because of the potential cost.
''We are really just past caring now. I knew this was going to happen
after going to the tribunal because things had gone too far.
''We are moving into Badenoch House for the homeless in Kingussie but
I am quite confident of eventually getting a council house.
''The family doesn't want to move away from this area, and this house
was the only one the kids ever knew.''
He added: ''I have not really got anything lined up as far as work is
concerned. But I wouldn't go to a job with a tied house . . . ''
The industrial tribunal held in Inverness heard that Mr Dey slashed a
tyre on a van parked on the estate because he was frustrated with
alleged poachers.
No-one from Strathspey Estates was available for comment
yesterday.

Your article (January 23) dwells on the subsidies required to maintain
the Scottish rail network. This is to imply that only rail services
receive subsidies.
The railway competes with commercial road transport under severe
handicaps. Road users pay nothing for the capital invested in the road
system, this, having been raised by taxation, constitutes a disguised
subsidy, dwarfing any sums paid to BR. When this factor is taken into
account any supposed surplus of revenue over expenditure on roads is
eliminated.
Big as this subsidy is, the bus operator gets an additional one, he
gets his ''track'' virtually free, paying only a minimum vehicle licence
fee and receiving full rebate of fuel tax.
In contrast, ScotRail is now having to meet demands from Railtrack
double those which were assigned to the same services a year back.
However, the major inequality is the demand for a return on capital as
part of the access charge, an element absent from the charges made to
road users.
Until this is redressed there will be no lasting solution to the
problem of funding railways, and the latter will remain unable to play
the part they should in relieving road congestion.
The Swedes, when they set up their Railtrack, had already recognised
the problem and went in the opposite direction. They instructed their
organisation to charge the train operators a sum similar to that which a
road user would face if performing the same task. The result is a basis
on which franchising can work to the advantage of everyone, resulting in
better services with a significant and growing return to rail of the
traffic which it formerly handled and, not least, a consequent reduction
in the need for subsidy.
The Swedes have by this means levelled the playing field on which road
and rail meet.
The Scottish railway system is in a fragile state and it is all too
easy to believe that the Establishment in the Scottish Office and the
Treasury would be happy to see it wither away, indifferent to the
consequences.
What a contrast with the attitude of our European cousins. Can it be
imagined that any of them would price out of existence the Fort
William-Mallaig steam train, a success story which has brought thousands
of people to the West Highlands from all over the world?

You may be correct about the tone of Jim Sillars's criticism of Alex
Salmond and about Iain Lawson's unfortunate reference to a geographical
split, but you underestimate the importance of the debate. In taking the
side of the SNP leader in this latest internal wrangle you have also
tended to concentrate on the headline and not what the man is reported
as having said.
If we assume that Kenny Farquharson's interview with Alex Salmond was
not a complete fabrication (SoS January 29), then the headline,
''Salmond backs devolution'', was perfectly justified despite Salmond's
subsequent protests to the contrary.
Salmond has a penchant for rewriting party history whenever he is
about to embark on a change of direction which he knows will be
controversial. His claim that, ''The party became confused in the 1970s.
They began to assume the tactics were the objective, and they weren't'',
is nonsense, but to justify his current positional change he has to
persuade the party that he is not about to make the same tactical errors
of the past.
The tactical error is first of all believing that devolution can be
used as a stepping stone to independence, and secondly in committing the
SNP to supporting a devolution Bill in the House of Commons.
Among all the nonsense which emanates from the Tories about the
inevitable consequences of devolution, it is difficult to be certain how
much they genuinely believe and how much is said for political effect.
There is no uncertainty, however, about Labour's reasons for wishing
to set up a Scottish Assembly. It recognises, if others cannot, that
devolution and independence are not different degrees of the same thing
and its commitment to devolution goes no deeper than its need to defuse
a potentially dangerous (for Labour) electoral situation in Scotland.
If it is acceptable for the Labour Party to believe that devolution
will strengthen the Union, why is it such a matter for derision if the
same argument is advanced by the fundamentalist wing of the Nationalist
movement?
It follows naturally, therefore, that there is no logical reason for
Nationalists to support devolution. Common sense as well as political
judgment dictates that there is nothing to be gained from supporting a
mechanism which is being set up for the prime purpose of strengthening
the one thing that Nationalists seek to dismantle -- the British state.
Despite attempts by Salmond and others to rewrite the history of the
SNP, it was never a part of the fundamentalist argument to refuse to
participate in an assembly if it were to be set up in spite of
Nationalist efforts to stop it. An assembly could be used, just like any
other elected body, to provide a platform for the case for independence.
But that is a far cry from supporting the idea of devolution as a
stepping stone to independence, or voting for it in the House of
Commons, having first gone through the charade of tabling a series of
amendments knowing full well that they will be rejected.
Tactically, if the SNP goes into the next General Election on the
platform that devolution can be used as another means of gaining
independence and that despite its reservations it would be prepared to
support such a Bill in the House of Commons, what incentive is there to
vote SNP in any Labour-held seat?
Which voter is going to switch from Labour to SNP ''to pressure the
Labour Party'' on the promise that the SNP will support Labour policy,
particularly if the loss of Labour seats could also mean the loss of a
Labour government? Is this supposed to be a serious political tactic?
Any SNP candidate who survived that platform would then have to fulfil
the obligation to support Labour's devolution agenda and run the risk of
making themselves Labour's creatures for the duration of the parliament.
And they say the fundamentalist argument is flawed!

While one must sympathise with the farmers whose livelihoods are
threatened by the cessation of the use of veal crates in this country,
surely a more morally acceptable solution to the excess supply of calves
could have been found, rather than merely shifting the problem to the
Continent.
To me the worrying factor is the demand, as vociferously stated by a
group of Welsh farmers on TV within the past two days, that they be
allowed to continue this lawful pursuit.
I understand, though I am willing to be corrected, that Eire does not
require to export live calves.
I conclude by reminding our friends that it is not so long ago that it
was perfectly lawful to send children up chimneys.

The irresponsible actions of the salmon lairds who have ignored
conservation measures on the Dee have shown the public the unacceptable
face of angling in Scotland.
The Dee is the epitome of angling privilege, where social status and
connections are more important than any love of the sport. We certainly
should not feel sorry for the lairds who are seeing their fishing
investments reduced in value owing to the inability of private
enterprise to manage the river properly.
Our concern should be reserved for the fish stocks and those whose
jobs are at risk.
In Scotland, angling employment has fallen below the 3500 jobs
identified in a 1989 survey.
Only by bringing all angling rights under a democratically elected
Scottish Anglers Trust can we fully exploit the enormous economic
potential of our fishings, and ensure all anglers have access at
reasonable cost allied to conservation.

Duncan Black, in his report on ''triage'' (January 27), wrongly
attributes the derivation of the word to tri, meaning three stages of
treatment.
The term, extensively used in the Services, is from the French
''trier'', meaning to sift, and triage is the process of sifting or
sorting casualties into priorities for treatment or evacuation to a
treatment facility.

THE executive of the largest rail union, the Rail, Maritime and
Transport Union, has maintained its firm support for the disputed Clause
4 of the Labour Party constitution.
After consideration of a document from the Labour leadership
advocating modernisation of the clause, which calls for the ''common
ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange'' they
recommended unanimously that it be retained.
The only solace they offered Labour leader Tony Blair was the
suggested addition of the words, ''or control as appropriate, or return
to public ownership or control''.
The RMT executive also proposed that the clause be revised to reflect
a belief in the restoration of full employment, with recognition of the
importance of manfacturing industry; a commitment to invest in modern
transport and communication links; and co-operation with other nations,
especially EU members, to maximise economic growth and employment
opportunities.
Although the RMT is not one of the largest trade unions, its position
is important in that British Rail is in the process of being privatised
and Labour leaders are being asked to give firm assurances that a Labour
government would return rail to public ownership, or control.
RMT general secretary Jimmy Knapp said last night: ''The amendment we
have proposed reflects the union's deep commitment and belief in the
future of railways as an industry in public ownership''.
Deputy Labour leader, and RMT sponsored MP, Mr John Prescott has been
invited to address the March meeting of the RMT executive.

So Glasgow's mandarins want to construct a #2m ivory tower from which
to admire their achievements. Perhaps if they opened their eyes at
ground level they would see the widespread poverty and deprivation.
Surely a socialist council in a city such as Glasgow should invest all
its energies and funds in providing adequate housing for all its
residents.
As a council tax payer I resent public money being squandered on pie
in the sky projects.
Such a scheme is an insult to the city's poor and homeless. Perhaps
the City Chambers bigwigs will throw them a jeely piece from the 14th
floor.

I never cease to be amazed that a quality newspaper should allow David
Belcher space to peddle his ghastly wares, and what's more, probably pay
him for it.
His latest snide comments on Bob Dylan's forthcoming visit to Scotland
do your paper no credit and say more about Belcher than Dylan.
I, like Belcher, was overlooked when the musical talent was being
distributed but I can appreciate genius in others.
Belcher comes across as a frustrated musician carrying a very large

ALLEGED mass murderer Mrs Rosemary West spent four hours in court
yesterday listening to legal arguments involving two barristers.
The debate cannot be reported as the committal proceedings -- to
decide whether she has a case to answer before a jury -- are being held
under strict reporting restrictions, limiting the amount of public
information.
Mrs West, 41, is accused of 10 murders, including those of her
daughter Heather, 16, and step-daughter Charmaine, eight.
At the end of day one of the committal proceedings in the tiny
courtroom at the Cotswold town of Dursley, Gloucestershire, Chief
Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Peter Badge adjourned the court
overnight.
Today, he will rule on the legal argument involving Crown Prosecutor
Mr Neil Butterfield, QC, and defence barrister Miss Sasha Wass.
The remains of all the alleged murder victims, except Charmaine, were
discovered in a police dig at Mrs West's home and garden at 25 Cromwell
Street, Gloucester, last year.
Charmaine's remains were recovered when police diggers broke through a
concrete floor of a kitchen at a former family home at 25 Midland Road
in the city. All the victims are said to have died between 1970 and
1987.
The bespectacled mother-of-seven also faces two rape charges --
jointly with named men -- allegedly involving an under-age girl. They
are said to have taken place between July 6, 1974, and July 6, 1980.
Only six members of the public were admitted to the courtroom
yesterday -- five local schoolgirls and a local man. Apart from them,
the public gallery was filled with reporters and about a dozen people
thought to be relatives of alleged victims.
Scores of journalists and TV crews jockeyed for position as Mrs West
was driven in a police van with blacked out windows into the grounds of
the police station adjoining the court building. A number of local
people shouted abuse.
Mr Badge must decide whether the prosecution has made its case to send
her for trial to the crown court. The hearing is expected to last all
this week.

<TEXT>
PRIVATE Lee Clegg should be released without delay from his life
sentence for murdering a girl joyrider in Northern Ireland, a television
''jury'' voted last night.
The 100-strong Panorama audience voted 56 to 44 for the jailed
paratrooper's release.
The audience was chosen from applicants to take part in other BBC
current affairs programmes, and was politically balanced, including 10%
from Northern Ireland.
Earier, Clegg's solicitor Simon McKay, who had threatened legal action
to prevent Panorama showing what he called a ''mock trial'', said his
client and the committee campaigning for his release no longer had any
''concerns'' about the programme.
More than a million people are said to have added their names to the
call for Clegg's release after a High Court rejection of an appeal.
The programme heard evidence from six people with first-hand or
specialist knowledge of the case. They were questioned by two QCs, Sir
Ivan Lawrence and Michael Mansfield.
Sir Ivan said Clegg should be released. ''He was obviously faced
suddenly with a high-stress situation not of his own making . . . his
action, although deliberate, was not premeditated.''
Mr Mansfield said that under the present law the question of Clegg's
release must be subjected to the same criteria as applied to all those
convicted of premeditated murder. There should be no special exception
for members of the armed forces.

WE mentioned that Irvine Development Corporation had claimed Gordon
Broon frae Troon as one of their own and were using his considerable
bulk as a metaphor for how big it is possible to grow in the Ayrshire
new town.
An Irvinite has been in touch to point out that the corporation has
overlooked a current world champion sportsperson in their own midst. He
is Paul Weir, world super bantam champ. But at 5ft2ins and eight stones,
he is not exactly an advert for growing big.
Perhaps big Broon ate all the pies and wee Paul got none.
Making a guinea pig
of yourself
IF we can help somebody as we pass this way, then our living shall not
be in vain. This song is forever on the Diary's lips.
Which is why we are delighted to help the students at Strathclyde
University hotel school. These young people apply themselves assiduously
to learning about gastronomy and fine wines. But what good are these
skills without a willing public upon which to practice.
To this end the hotel school is setting up the Fine Dining Club which
will convene three or four times a year for wine tastings followed by
dinner. There is no joining fee and the evenings will range from #20 to
#40 depending on the wines and the menu.
The club is the brainchild of Colin Gillespie, a Glasgow Malmaison and
Gleneagles chap, who is now lecturer in gastronomy at the hotel school.
Mr Gillespie is a real enthusiast, so much so that during his
conversation with the Diary he repeatedly lapsed into bad language.
Effan bee this, effan that. We were relieved to discover that F&amp;B is the
food and beverage section of the hotel school degree course.
Anyone wanting to join the Fine Dining Club should contact Colin
Gillespie for an application form.
We tried a hotel school lunch -- celeriac, leek and marjoram soup;
wild boar sausage on a bed of green puy lentils; and the fresh fruit
salad scented with star-anise and rose. Washed down with some Freixenet
cava.
A delicious meal that leaves not just a gastronomic glow but the
feeling that you are helping some poor students make their way in this
world.
Making in-roads
STRATHCLYDE region is currently exhibiting a huge and rather pretty
model of the planned extensions to the motorway system in and around
Glasgow.
The Diary's phone has been red hot with two calls from people who have
seen the model and whose minds have not been put entirely at ease as to
the issue of private car versus public transport.
Quite frankly, they see something sinister in the fact that Central
Station is completely missing.
Times of his life
ALLAN SHIACH is well known for his double life. As Shiach he is
chairman and chief executive of the Macallan-Glenlivet whisky company
and is also on the boards of our own dear Caledonian Newspapers and
Scottish Television.
Under the name Allan Scott he finds time to be a Hollywood script
writer.
So what do you buy someone who has everything twice? For his Christmas
Mr Shiach-Scott was given a pair of cufflinks with a watch in each. He
keeps one watch on Greenwich Mean Time and the other set to Hollywood.
Mission abroad
STUDENTS of the newspaper industry will have noticed that the London
press magnates have rediscovered Scotland. Teams of journalists have
been dispatched north to put a kilt and a pair of tartan underpants on
to public prints which hitherto carried derisory amounts of Scottish
column inches. But we cannot help but feel the commitment is not total.
Like when the Sunday Times sends its foreign editor up to take an
overview of the operation.
A man-eat-dog world
FROM Botswana, via Diary reader Amy Kinnaird of Cumnock, we hear of a
variation on the ''Man bites dog'' theme. It is a newspaper cutting
headed ''Man eats dog's liver''.
The man ''got so angry after his dog ate his food that he cut open the
dog, removed its liver, and ate it raw while the dog lied (sic) on the
ground grasping for its last breath . . . The man ignored onlookers who
tried to plead for the dog's life. All he could say to them was 'it ate
my seswaa and now I have to eat it'.''
A local police spokesman was reported as saying there would be no
charges against the man on the grounds that it was his dog and it had,
after all, eaten his lunch.
We don't think Barbara Woodhouse would have approved.
* WE are always happy to receive reports of the use of colourful
language by spectators at sporting events. Like this at a recent
football match in Greenock: ''For goodness sake, Morton! Your defence is
all higgledy-piggledy!''

SENIOR Glasgow councillor Patricia Chalmers has demanded an inquiry
into the circumstances under which she lost the contest to be
prospective Labour candidate for Partick in the new Glasgow unitary
authority.
Councillor Chalmers, who is secretary of the Labour Group on Glasgow
District Council, was beaten 16-14 by Mr David Moxham, personal
assistant to the Hillhead MP, Mr George Galloway.
It is understood Councillor Chalmers has complained to the Scottish
Labour Party about alleged voting irregularities at the selection
conference.
Two other women councillors have so far failed to gain seats for the
new authority, despite the Labour Party's push to bring more women into
politics at every level.
District councillor Margaret Sinclair lost the Crookston nomination to
Strathclyde councillor William Timoney, while Scotland's only Asian
woman councillor, Ms Neelam Bakshi, lost out in two north side wards.
It is understood Councillor Bakshi has another north side seat to bid
for this weekend.
One success for women candidates last night was the selection of
Councillor Yvonne Anderson to fight the Calton ward in Glasgow for
Labour in the April elections.

Waitingi, Monday,
A MAORI protester bared his tattooed buttocks while others spat at the
Queen's representative and the Prime Minister in New Zealand today at
the 155th anniversary of a treaty between indigenous tribes and British
colonists.
A crowd of about 500 angry Maoris in Waitangi booed and jeered at
Governor-General Dame Catherine Tizard and Prime Minister Jim Bolger.
Police scuffled with demonstrators who raised a rebel flag of Maori
independence and stamped on a New Zealand flag. No arrests were
reported.
Other anniversary events were cancelled after Maori leaders warned
they could not guaranteee the safety of government officials.
Earlier arsonists tried to set fire to a historic wooden building
where the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in 1840.
Police said it was the rowdiest observance since the 150th anniversary
in 1990 when Maoris bared their buttocks at the Queen, who was visiting
New Zealand as head of state. The act, known as whakapohane, is regarded
as a gross insult in Maori tradition.
Leaders of today's protest said they were angry about a government
plan to settle land claims by tribes, some of which date back to the
treaty.
Under the proposal the government will give Maori people #400m in
compensation for land taken by settlers in breach of the agreement.
The treaty gave Britain sovereignty over New Zealand. Maoris agreed to
sell some land in return for protection of their tribal land rights and
traditions. However, this was ignored by settlers and led to war in the
last century.
* An earthquake with a reading of 7 rattled a mountainous, thinly
populated area of New Zealand today. No damage or injuries were
reported. ''It was a bit of a thump, that's about all,'' said a police
officer.--AP.

A SINO-AMERICAN trade war is still not a fact, but it remains a
distinct possibility. The cause for war, even if only in trade taxes and
embargoes, is easily identifiable. The Chinese produce all sorts of
goods whose invention was by others without paying anything for the
right, including copyright, to do so. It is not as if the Chinese do not
understand or accept the concept of copyright : their courts have just
accepted that the widow of the last Emperor, Henry Pu Yi, should receive
copyright royalties on sales of his autobiography. Yet 29 factories in
the south of the country are churning out millions of copies of American
compact discs without paying anything to the patent and copyright
holders. This amounts to a kind of international intellectual theft,
which is easy to perpetrate given the state of contemporary technology
but hard to defend in any context. The scale of the activity is enormous
and it should not be surprising that the Americans talk about imposing
an import tax equal to the value of the pirate trade.
The Chinese are taking a haughty line on this possibility and insist
that, quite apart from retaliation, they can sell the same goods as are
at present being sold to the US into ''countless other markets''. The
answer to the threat is obvious enough: they should try it. Few markets
are as open and as liquid as the US, especially on the scale of the
existing Sino-American trade. The haughty line is unacceptable to other
traders with China, including the members of the European Union, for
all, to a greater or lesser degree, will find themselves damaged
economically if the Chinese simply do not pay for what they use. If
modern China wants to play a role in contemporary international
capitalism, she has to play by its rules. That is quite firmly accepted
in relation to financial capital itself, for industrial development.
Capital would not flow to China (or anywhere else) if it were simply to
be sequestrated. It seems to be hard to get the Chinese to see any
parallel between hard cash and ''know-how'', but they are both forms of
property and many of those who own it will be backing the American line.
Sino-American negotiations, which broke down last month, may
recommence in Beijing. Possibly agreement at them is being frustrated by
uncertainties over the future course of Chinese policies in all spheres
while there is no agreement on a successor (or more likely, successors)
to Deng Xiaoping. President Deng could die any time. The possibility
that he is being kept alive artificially (like Franco and Tito) because
of complexities of succession cannot be dismissed lightly, but the
present Chinese attitude is quite consistent with their initial
unyielding positions on most foreign relations. Longer consideration
often leaves them more reasonable -- but their present position is
unreasonable, and has to be contested firmly.

WATER quangos are not good news. Announcing the newly appointed
chairmen of Scotland's three water authorities, the Secretary of State
for Scotland contrived yesterday, with the help of the Citizen's Charter
Minister, to make matters worse. On the face of it this was a difficult
task. The removal of the supply of water and sewerage services in
Scotland from democratic control is a reprehensible act despite the
relative softening of the proposals conceded by Mr Lang under heavy
public criticism. Much interest was expressed in the identity of the men
or women to be appointed to run the new authorities; everyone hoped that
the criteria applied in the search for the chairmen would be superior to
those employed in previous quango-stuffing exercises. That hope was
heightened by the appearance of Citizen's Charter Minister David Hunt
yesterday at the Nolan inquiry into standards in public life. Mr Hunt
arrived bearing the Government's proposals on appointments to public
bodies. A more open approach is urged by the Government. Those sitting
on quangos should not be the great and the good (however defined) but
public-spirited and well-qualified people. Posts should be advertised,
especially those which are paid.
This was followed in Scotland by Mr Lang's list of water quango
chairmen. We make absolutely no comment on their qualifications to be
regarded as great or good; no doubt their families can testify to that
in private. They may well be public-spirited, but are they the best
qualified people to run water and sewerage authorities? Mr Jameson is a
chartered surveyor, former local politician, and a member of the
Conservative Party. Mr Robertson is a northern businessman with much
experience in holding public appointments. Dr Preston is the demitting
chairman of Scottish Power whose salary with that organisation reflected
his enthusiastic appreciation of the incentive share-option scheme for
privatised industries. All of them will be well paid for their part-time
efforts with the water authorities but none of them can muster, as far
as is discernible from their known careers, great knowledge of the water
industries.
There is no need to labour the point. Their qualifications for these
posts are not clear. As we have said before, the notion that those
managing biscuit factories are thereby qualified to run the world is
dangerous nonsense. Neither do their appointments seem to fit with Mr
Hunt's proposals to the Nolan inquiry. It is indeed a shame that they
should have allowed themselves to be placed at the forefront of one of
Mr Lang's most unpopular Scottish policies, especially as a change of
government would lead to their instant removal. For the moment it is
clear that all three must make the best of the job handed to them. This
will not be easy in an underfunded sector requiring substantial
investment, much of which Mr Lang believes will be available in the form
of private finance. Time will tell whether financiers are keen on the
Scottish model of quasi-privatisation of water services. For the moment
we can only say that an inauspicious start has been made.

<HEADLINE>Man who strangled disabled sister gets four years</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A MAN, who strangled his disabled sister before confessing to police
in a 999 call, was jailed for four years yesterday at the High Court in
Edinburgh.
Student Gavin Ferguson, 36, told police he had ''protected'' his
younger sister Lynn, who suffered from cerebral palsy, in the earlier
years of their family life together.
Lord Osborne told Ferguson: ''You have pled guilty to the culpable
homicide of your own sister and that itself is a tragic situation.''
First offender Ferguson, described as a prisoner in Edinburgh, had
earlier gone on trial for the murder of his 32-year-old sister at the
family home at South Street, Cowdenbeath, in Fife, on September 15 last
year. He was accused of seizing her neck, compressing it, and
restricting her breathing.
However, after hearing evidence, the Crown accepted his plea of guilty
to the reduced charge of culpable homicide.
During the evidence, Ferguson wept as jurors heard of a 999 call he
made to police headquarters at Dysart in Fife minutes after the killing.
He told operations room officer Sergeant David Kay, 36, that he had
killed his sister and added: ''I strangled her. I have not spoken to my
sister for, like, nine years. I love her. I love my sister. I love her
to the ends of the earth.
''My sister is a spastic. I went through life protecting her. She
hates me. She doesn't hate me any more.''
Sergeant Kay said the caller was distressed and upset and appeared to
have ''a drink in him''. Constable John Nugent, 23, who was called out
to the death scene, found Ferguson still on the phone to the officer
dealing with the 999 call.
''He was very distressed. He was actually crouched down and shaking
slightly and crying at the same time,'' said PC Nugent.
Ferguson's sister was dead in a chair in the living room of the family
home.
The court heard that before Ferguson had gone back to his mother and
father's home that night he had been drinking Pernod in pubs in
Cowdenbeath.
Defence counsel Andrew Hardie, QC, told the court after the plea to
the reduced charge was accepted that Ferguson would occasionally return
to the parental home if he fell out with his girlfriend.
A few weeks before the killing, Ferguson had contemplated suicide
after becoming depressed.
He had argued with his girlfriend and had gone to the family home in
Cowdenbeath. He went out drinking and, when he returned, his sister
would not let him in.
He went to his older brother's house but he was not at home. Ferguson
had then gone to his parents' home, where his sister was, and entered
through the back door.
Ferguson's recollection of events was somewhat ''hazy'' but he
remembered shouting at his sister about why she would not let him in. He
also recalled pushing her down with the flat of his hand.
''The next recollection he has is that he realised that he had killed
his sister,'' said Mr Hardie. ''Clearly he is devastated by this whole
incident, as is the family. Clearly they have lost their daughter and
their son is responsible for that,'' said Mr Hardie.
''Whatever sentence is imposed, Mr Ferguson will have with him for the
rest of his life that he took the life of his sister.''
Lord Osborne told Ferguson: ''Nevertheless a life has been taken and I
have to reflect that in the sentence I impose.'' The judge said he
accepted the circumstances of the killing involved ''the most unhappy
outcome so far as you are concerned''.

<HEADLINE>Tribunal decides university's dismissal of woman with 27 years' service was unfair Lecturer wins job back and #41,000</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>GRAEME SMITH</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
AN INDUSTRIAL tribunal has ordered Aberdeen's Robert Gordon University
to give a senior lecturer her job back and pay her #41,000 compensation
after deciding she was unfairly dismissed.
The tribunal concluded Mrs Sheena Falconer had not been made redundant
because, when Principal Dr David Kennedy made the decision to dismiss
her, he did not have all the relevant facts before him.
It also said the university distorted the true picture by
concentrating on what it saw as the primary component of her function to
the exclusion of all else she was employed to do.
After 27 years' service, Mrs Falconer, of Anderson Drive, Aberdeen,
was offered redundancy or an alternative post as a lecturer which would
have meant putting her sister, also a lecturer, out of work.
Colleagues held a series of one-day strikes in support of her after
she was dismissed in April 1993 and yesterday her union, the Educational
Institute of Scotland, said the decision vindicated their actions and
justice had been served.
Mrs Falconer, who was a senior lecturer in the School of Food and
Consumer Studies, said she looked forward to returning to work alongside
the colleagues who had supported her and students who had also been
extremely supportive.
The university declined to comment until it had examined the 27 pages
of the tribunal's findings and discussed them with its legal
representatives.
The university had argued that Mrs Falconer's dismissal was
attributable to the fact that the work for which she was employed had
diminished to such a degree that her services were no longer needed.
She argued that she carried out a range of other work which had not
diminished.
The tribunal said it could not see the evidence which warranted the
transformation of the ''possibility'' of redundancy in December 1992
into the ''decision taken'' in January 1993.
''It appeared that the principal's information about what transpired
in the meantime was incomplete and what he had was directed solely at
the issue of alternative employment.
''It did not contemplate the question of whether Mrs Falconer was
redundant at all which, as Dr Stringer (Dean of the Faculty of Food and
Health) knew, was her contention.
''It was only after the decision was taken that the principal learned
that the calculations upon which he based his decision, at least in
part, were challenged.''
The tribunal said there was no consultation prior to the decision to
dismiss and there was considerable consultation after the decision was
made but it was ''a rescue exercise''.
The tribunal decided that Mrs Falconer had been unfairly dismissed,
that she should be re-engaged by April 17, and receive #40,977.52 back
pay.
Mrs Falconer said last night she was delighted to have won. ''It was
nothing to do with money. It was the principle of the thing. You can't
just turn round and do this to someone, especially someone with my
length of service.''
She said she had bought a clothing company in Keith but she would
definitely be returning to work and would leave the company in the
day-to-day care of her manager.
''It was all totally unnecessary. I was never redundant in the first
place,'' she said, adding that she believed it was a personality clash
which led to her dismissal.
''Why would you get rid of someone who was valuable to you unless you
didn't like them? There was no other reason. There was no rationale to
it. It has been quite horrific and you cannot believe that someone to
whom you have given loyal service for so many years would do the dirty
on you like they did to me.
''I have been proved right but it has been a terrible strain on
myself, my family, and my colleagues.''
Dr Alastair McLeish, the EIS spokesman at the university, said:
''Justice has been served. Union members in the university are extremely
pleased by the tribunal's findings.''

A #1m investment by ScottishPower has secured 85 jobs at the
threatened Methil power station in Fife.
0 The station supports a large number of secondary jobs in
distribution, retail, and supplier services but had faced closure
because its technology was largely outdated.
Fife Enterprise's chief executive, Mr Robert MacKenzie, said the
investment would help to create a potential new role for the station and
justify its continued operation.
He said the investment would enable Methil to continue to burn coal
slurry in the short term and provide for fuel flexibility in the longer
term.
Station manager Mr Jon Osborne said: ''With relatively minor
upgrading, in the future we will be able to pursue contracts to burn
alternative fuels to coal slurry.''
A ScottishPower spokesman said the company was in a strong position
and had developed interconnections for supply with England and Wales.
This had made it worthwhile to invest in Methil.

<HEADLINE>'Treasure' platinum seized in Philippines</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979976391</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
Manila, Monday,
GOVERNMENT agents have recovered two tons of platinum worth an
estimated #320m and believed to be part of the fabled ''treasure'' left
by a Second World War Japanese general.
Epimaco Velasco, director of the National Bureau of Investigation,
said the platinum was seized yesterday from a villager in Katayaman in
Lallo, Cagayan.
He said that in May 1993 a Japanese treasure hunter had found the
platinum, a precious metal more expensive than gold, 70ft deep in the
sea off Cagayan province. It was then taken to the Lallo resident for
safe keeping.
''The Japanese people have been looking for this for several years.
This is part of the Yamashita treasure,'' said Velasco.
He could not say, however, why he believed it was part of the treasure
rumoured to have been left by General Tomoyuki Yamashita, commander of
Japanese forces in the Philippines at the close of the war.
Yamashita, known as the Tiger of Malaya, was hanged for war crimes in
1946.
Rumours of Japanese treasure have surfaced periodically since the end
of the war. Sceptics, however, dismiss them as modern versions of the
''cities of gold'' that led Spanish conquistadors on fruitless
expeditions to Latin America centuries ago.
Rumour says the treasure was looted from south-east Asia after
Japanese forces invaded, and was buried in 170 locations throughout the
Philippines.
The platinum, in a 2ft tall bell shape, was shown to reporters after
metallurgists confirmed it was platinum.
An NBI agent said the finding was first reported to the authorities by
the treasure hunter, the son of a former Japanese soldier who served in
the Philippines during the war.
The agent said the Japanese reported to authorities after the Filipino
keeping the platinum safe refused to hand it over.
By law, such treasures are considered government property. Velasco,
however, said the finder would be given a substantial share of the
proceeds from its sale.--AP.

Tokyo, Monday
THE Princess of Wales went on a charm offensive today as she again
stepped into the international spotlight on the first day of a working
visit to Japan.
She visited a children's hospital in Tokyo and in a speech partly in
Japanese, expressed her sympathy for victims of the Kobe earthquake.
On the first visit of her four-day tour, the princess told a luncheon
at the National Children's Hospital in Tokyo: ''My heart goes out to the
victims of this savage natural disaster and, of course, to their
families.''
The Great Hanshin earthquake hit the Kobe region on January 17 killing
more than 5000 people and injuring 25,000.
The princess will not be visiting Kobe, but she said: ''In the last
three weeks our thoughts have been with the children and families of
Kobe and surrounding areas, victims of a most terrifying earthquake.
''Yet in the midst of the most dreadful devastation it was wonderful
to see neighbours coming to the help of those who needed it and to
witness the strong sense of community in the rescue.
''The resistance and optimism of the Japanese people has been much in
evidence during this tragic time.''
The hospital, which the princess visited in 1990 when in Japan for the
enthronement of Emperor Akihito, is linked to the Great Ormond Street
Hospital in London, of which she is president.
Today's visit was the highlight in the hospital's ground-breaking
treatment of children and its links with Great Ormond Street's Peter Pan
Children's Fund appeal, launched in Japan in 1993.
Despite reports of a chill in official Japanese attitudes to the
now-estranged wife of the Prince of Wales, the princess was a hit with
her audience with a 20-second introduction to her speech in Japanese.
Buckingham Palace officials said she had been practising to get the
pronunciation and intonation exactly right, with four weeks' coaching
from a Japanese woman in London.
Although revelations about the princess's marriage difficulties have
taken the edge off some of their devotion, most Japanese, especially the
women, still regard her as a beautiful role model.
Several hundred people gathered outside the hospital by the time the
princess left, despite there being little advance publicity. The visit
was also covered by dozens of Japanese TV crews, photographers, and
reporters.

Grozny, Monday
Russian forces said today they had crossed the crucial Sunzha River in
Grozny and gained ground in south-eastern parts of the city, but there
were conflicting reports on the pace of their advance.
Itar-Tass news agency quoted regional military headquarters in Mozdok
as saying the Russians had seized Minutka Square, a key separatist
stronghold in the south-east of the city.
''This ends the organised resistance of fighters on the territory of
the entire city,'' said the report.
Moscow's forces were still bombarding the area around Minutka and
small groups of Chechen fighters continued moving towards the area from
the south.
Civilians fleeing the shelling made no mention of seeing any Russian
troops.
Interfax news agency, in a conflicting report, quoted an unnamed
Mozdok official as saying Russian troops had crossed the Sunzha River
two miles west of the city centre but had advanced no further.
Russian reports of military success in Chechnya have frequently been
over-optimistic.
The Russian forces, sent into Chechnya on December 11 to crush the
region's three-year independence bid, seized the central presidential
palace two weeks ago, turning Minutka Square into the main centre of
resistance.
The Russian air force continued attacking Chechen positions in the
south of the city, where correspondents saw two Sukhoi Su-27
fighter-bombers making low passes to drop bombs.
The fall of Grozny would not signal the end of Russia's military
campaign in the North Caucasus territory.
Russian military officials say Gudermes, a town 25 miles east of
Grozny with strong fortifications and containing an estimated 5,000
fighters, is likely to become the next centre of resistance.
Sergei Filatov, a top aide of President Boris Yeltsin, said on Monday
456 Russian servicemen had been officially registered as missing in
action in Chechnya, Interfax news agency said.

Beijing, Monday,
THE United States and China will resume talks next week in Beijing in
hopes of heading off a brewing trade war.
US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor told a news conference: ''It's a
step in the right direction. We are going to these talks with an open
mind.''
China's Trade Minister, Madam Wu Yi, extended the invitation to resume
the negotiations in a letter to the Clinton administration.
The offer to resume the talks came less than 24 hours after the United
States said it would impose 100% tariffs more than $1bn worth of Chinese
products.
The amount is roughly equal to what American businesses say they lose
because of Chinese piracy of copyrighted US music, films, and computer
software.
''I don't know how China could have responded more quickly,'' said an
upbeat Kantor. However he cautioned that ''we're not going to rule
anything out'' if the talks collapse and the Chinese follow through with
their threat to retaliate with their own tariffs.
''Let me reiterate that piracy of US products is an extremely serious
problem, and we expect the Chinese to come to the table prepared to
address our concerns,'' said Kantor.
Although the products that would double in price under punitive
tariffs announced by Washington are only a small part of China's total
exports, an escalating trade war could be serious for both sides.--AP.

<RECORDNO>979976397</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ANTI-NUCLEAR campaigners and environmentalists yesterday fired warning
shots over the bow of plans to build the world's first nuclear submarine
museum on the Clyde.
Less than three years since the departure of the US Navy and its
nuclear arsenal from the Holy Loch, the proposals are being developed by
a group of island hoteliers and retired Navy personnel on Bute in an
effort to increase tourism.
They intend floating the plans with funding agencies to gain support
for the museum near Rothesay which could mean the return of a
de-commissioned nuclear submarine and other post-war vessels to the
Clyde.
However, such a prospect immediately came under fire from Scottish
CND. Mr Brian Quail, its joint secretary, said: ''Once again reality
outpaces satire. This is a grotesque situation which violates everything
that Rothesay offers to its visitors.
''These hulks will remain radioactive for centuries to come. I can
only wonder if they are going to provide free iodine tablets and
radiation suits for all those innocents who venture abroad.''
Mr Quail said he was certain the people of Rothesay did not want their
town to become a nuclear graveyard. ''It is bad enough living next to
the biggest stockpile of nuclear weapons in Western Europe at
Coulport.''
A spokesman for Friends of the Earth said his gut reaction was the
same as SCND. ''It is grotesque.'' While FoE was prepared to concede it
might well be possible to decontaminate the bulkheads, it said ''there
would need to be thorough checks to ensure public safety''.
The plan is the brainchild of former Second World War seamen and
submariners who live on the island and who are keen to create Scotland's
first all-weather naval visitors' centre which could include both
nuclear and diesel electric vessels currently being taken out of
commission by the Royal Navy. Many are being laid up and likely to
become rusting hulks in yards like Rosyth.
''There is not one nuclear submarine on display anywhere in the world
and nowhere in Scotland do we have any record of the naval defence of
our nation,'' said project co-ordinator Mr Randall Walton.
Mr Walton, a former merchant seaman and now a hotelier on Bute, said
that such a project would not only preserve a vital part of Britain's
heritage for future generations, it could provide the platform for
reviving the tourist trade of the island.
''There is a current glut of naval vessels after the end of the Cold
War and we think it would be far better that taxpayers' money should be
spent retaining these ships rather than seeing them used for target
practice,'' he said.
The plans are to build an enclosed museum area where visitors can walk
on board the vessels and see exhibitions and videos depicting naval
history covering the past 30 to 40 years.
The Bute group also intends to use the project to attract naval
reunions and special trips for ex-mariners, many of whom served their
time in the navy in Rothesay Bay.

Washington, Monday
PRESIDENT Clinton submitted his budget today. He proposes that the US
federal Government should spend $1.6 trillion next year, with a deficit
of $192.5bn.
The Republicans who control Congress will use the budget to make
political points, then ignore it and produce their own version. They vow
to balance the budget by 2002, and that means they must start cutting
the deficit immediately. However, they have also promised to cut taxes
by $200bn over the next five years.
Mr Clinton has often boasted that he had reduced the federal deficit
over the past two years. He has now given up the attempt, responding to
the election results. He proposes deficits remaining at their present
levels for the next five years, and if the Republicans can do any
better, let them.
His only concession towards cutting the deficit is that it will drop
as a proportion of gross domestic product from 2.5% to 2.2% by 2000.
He, too, wants to cut taxes -- but by only $60bn over five years. What
is more, his cuts will help those earning less than $75,000 a year,
particularly those with children (including the most expensive sort,
university students). He calls it a middle-class Bill of Rights. The
Republicans are much more generous to the rich.
The sums involved in an American budget are always impressive. Total
expenditures will be roughly 50% greater than the United Kingdom's
entire GNP. The Department of Human Services' budget is double Russia's
GNP.
The president proposes to eliminate a long list of programmes, none of
them very large, and to cut many others. The Republicans will no doubt
be much more draconian, and there will be a stiff debate before the
final list is completed.
Republicans, for instance, want to eliminate the Public Broadcasting
Service and a fierce battle is already raging on that issue.
Most of the new Republican Congressmen come from rural districts that
benefit from agricultural subsidies. What will they say to proposals to
limit or eliminate them, as they must be eliminated to balance the
budget? In years past, with the Democrats in control of Congress, the
Republicans could have it both ways, demanding fiscal responsibility but
insisting on preserving their own favourite subsidies.
Now they must do the balancing themselves, and there is already a
split between the deficit hawks, who emphasise the party's promise to
balance the budget, and the old-line Reaganites who prefer to cut taxes
and let the deficit look after itself.

Athens, Monday
GREECE said today it had seen no proof that ancient ruins in Egypt's
Western Desert are part of Alexander the Great's tomb.
Culture Minister Thanos Mikroutsikos told a news conference: ''Nothing
indicates that the tomb of Alexander the Great has been discovered.''
He was speaking after the return of experts sent by his Ministry to
Siwa, in western Egypt, to investigate claims that the Macedonian
warrior-king's burial place had been found.
The report by the Greek experts dampened hopes that one of the world's
great archaeological discoveries had been made.
Theys said that the monument itself, which they refused to describe as
a tomb, seemed to be from Roman times, much later than Alexander's
period.
Greek archaeologist Liana Souvaltzi said nounced last week she had
found three tablets which showed Alexander was buried at the site after
his death in Babylon in 323 BC.
''Unfortunately we were not briefed by Mrs Souvaltzi, the person most
suited to inform us. What we saw proves nothing,'' said Yannis Tzedakis,
head of antiquities at the Greek Ministry.--Reuter.

DOUG McClure, the cowboy star of the TV shows The Virginian, The
Overland Trail, and The Men From Shiloh has died of cancer. He was 59.
McClure died at his home in the Los Angeles suburb of Sherman Oaks
with family and friends by his side, said his friend, Dennis Morga.
After fighting lung cancer for a year, McClure appeared last December
for the installation of his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Getting
the star helped him to feel better, he told well-wishers.
''It gave me the incentive to get well, and I am well,'' he declared.
However, on January 8, the actor collapsed from an apparent stroke on
the set of a theatrical film in Hawaii and was flown to Los Angeles.
Doctors discovered the cancer had spread to his liver and bones.
''Doug was one of the kindest people I have ever known, and a real
gentleman,'' said Morga.
McClure's career took off in 1960 when he was cast as William Bendix's
sidekick in the NBC series The Overland Trail. The show lasted only a
half-season, and he immediately started on Checkmate, a private-eye
series.
In 1962, he joined the The Virginian, another NBC project which was
the first filmed series with 90-minute episodes.
His many other film credits include Cannonball Run II, 52 Pickup,
Omega Syndrome, Dark Before Dawn, and Tapeheads.
McClure is survived by his wife Diane, two children from previous
marriages, Tane and Valerie McClure; his mother, Clara Clapp, and a
brother, Reed.

New York, Monday
THE alleged mastermind of the plot to bomb the United Nations building
and other US landmarks pleaded guilty today and read a statement
implicating his alleged co-conspirators, lawyers said.
This is the second time that Siddiq Ibrahim Siddiq Ali, 34, has agreed
to co-operate with prosecutors. He gave his plea to Judge Michael
Mukasey shortly before the trial was to resume this morning.
Prosecutors allege that Siddiq Ali and 11 others, including Egyptian
Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, planned to ''wage a war of urban terrorism''
in the US.
Mukasey temporarily delayed proceedings until tomorrow because of the
plea. None of the defence lawyers was aware of the plea hearing and
began arriving in court at the end of Siddiq Ali's statement.
Lynne Stewart, who represents Abdel Rahman, said the other defence
lawyers would meet their clients later to determine whether to seek a
mis-trial or ask to give rebuttal opening statements.
Last June Siddiq Ali, allegedly the key conspirator, briefly became a
Government witness. He had been held in isolation from his co-accused.
The defendants are accused of helping to plan the 1993 World Trade
Centre bombing which killed six people and injured more than 1000. They
are also charged with plotting to bomb the UN and bridges and tunnels
leading into New York City.
The indictment also accuses them of involvement in the November 1990
murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane in New York and of planning to kill Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in 1993.-- Reuter.

THIRTY nursery pupils were given anti-biotics yesterday after one of
their classmates was taken to hospital suffering from the meningococal
disease that causes meningitis.
The four-year-old boy, who attends the morning nursery at St
Catherine's Primary School in Paisley, was ''satisfactory'' last night
in the town's Royal Alexandra Hospital.
The pupils were given the anti-biotics after a meeting between parents
and doctors from Argyll and Clyde Health Board.
Dr David Sloan, the board's consultant in public health medicine,
said: ''Following the national guidelines, we organised preventative
anti-biotics for the staff and pupils at the morning nursery class at St
Catherine's. The afternoon class was not affected. The family of the
child was also offered a short course of the anti-biotics by the
hospital.''
He added: ''While it is a very frightening disease that can strike out
of the heavens, it is a rare disease and the great majority of cases are
sporadic.''
Dr Sloan said that there was no threat to other children and there had
been no need to close the nursery.
He said: ''The disease doesn't act like normal infectious diseases. It
is all right to go back to school.''
Dr Sloan said they got between 15 and 20 cases a year in the board's
area. In Scotland there were about 200 cases a year.
''Because it can strike so suddenly with devastating results, everyone
is wary,'' Dr Sloan said.
Parents should be extra vigilant since this was the peak time for the
disease. Dr Sloan said: ''They should always be on the lookout for the
symptoms, which include headaches, fever, vomiting, drowsiness, and a
rash of purple spots which look like bruises.''

Los Angeles, Monday
THE jury in the O J Simpson double murder trial saw photographs of his
beaten ex-wife as her weeping sister testified that the football legend
humilated Nicole while she was pregnant by calling her a ''fat pig''.
Denise Brown said Simpson ''hated fat women. He would always comment
about her weight.'' The ''fat pig'' comments, she said, were made in
front of friends and family.
Brown said Nicole, her younger sister by two years, reacted to the
insults at one point by saying she didn't care how much weight she
gained, she just wanted Simpson to leave her.
When Nicole lost her pregnancy weight, Brown said, Simpson would
comment: ''Look at her. She looks great doesn't she, she's mine.''
''She was always like a possession,'' Brown said.
Brown, who has said publicly that she believes Simpson murdered her
younger sister, testified earlier that Simpson once grabbed his wife's
crotch in a crowded bar and bragged: ''This belongs to me. This is where
my babies come from.''
Simpson, an American football star turned sportscaster and actor, has
pleaded innocent in the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend
Ronald Goldman.
Brown, the prosecution's star witness in its attempt to show that
behind the public facade Simpson was a wife-beater with a violent
temper, cried as she looked at two photographs she had taken of Nicole
after Simpson beat her on New Year's Day, 1989.
One photograph, shown to the jury on a large screen, clearly showed
Nicole with a swollen right eye, right cheek, and chin.
Brown sobbed uncontrollably as she recalled the last time she saw her
sister, hours before Nicole was stabbed and slashed to death with
Goldman.
Brown said she, Nicole, Nicole's children Sydney and Justin, and other
members of the Brown family had dinner together. After the meal, Nicole
said she was taking her children for ice cream.
''We said goodbye. That was the last thing I saw of her. I never
hugged her,'' Brown sobbed.--Reuter.

Warsaw, Monday
POLISH President Lech Walesa pursued his dispute with the ruling
left-wing coalition today, telling Parliament to ditch Prime Minister
Waldemar Pawlak or face the consequences.
''I am asking you gentlemen, give in, otherwise history will not
forgive you,'' Walesa declared at a meeting with Speakers of both Houses
and heads of the main parliamentary parties. ''If you don't, I will take
certain decisions.''
Walesa did not specify the nature of his threat. Last week he said he
would use a controversial pretext to dissolve Parliament unless it voted
Pawlak out.
At the weekend Parliament said it would resist such a move by
referring Walesa to a special court. Politicians fear the president's
manoeuvre could cause a constitutional crisis, with two rival powers
trying to run the country.
Today Walesa again vowed to uphold the law and rejected any suggestion
he might use armed force.
The president renewed accusations that Pawlak's government had delayed
vital reforms and had tried to strip him of powers.
The former chief of the Solidarity union's pre-1989 fight for human
rights under communist rule also damned Parliament for criticising him
and accused the ex-communist Speaker of the lower House, Jozef Oleksy,
of hypocrisy.
''I am offended in public, insults are thrown at me . . . It is
distasteful, Speaker, that you are posing as the defender of democracy
while I remember how you were defending democracy . . . when you were
part of the Communist government.''
Walesa says the head of the ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance
(SLD), the larger partner in the two-party coalition with Pawlak's
Polish Peasant Party, would make a better premier.
Spokesmen from the two main parties said their leaders would meet
tomorrow night to discuss a possible Cabinet reshuffle.
Until now, the Peasant Party has refused to let Pawlak be replaced,
but a senior party source said tonight that they might decide to
sacrifice him.
''We are considering different options and one possibility is changing
the Prime Minister,'' the source said.
Most Polish commentators believe the real goal of Walesa's attack on
Pawlak has been to cause turmoil within left-wing parties and boost his
own chances against them in presidential elections at the end of this
year.
If a left-wing candidate beats Walesa, parties descended from Poland's
pre-1989 communist rulers would have taken back all power from the heirs
of his Solidarity movement.
Walesa's spokesman rejected a newspaper report today that the
president was thinking of making army chief of staff Tadeusz Wilecki
Prime Minister until new elections were held.
The army also denied the front-page report by top-selling daily Gazeta
Wyborcza. ''General Wilecki is a soldier and will keep far away from
politics,'' said Wilecki's spokesman.--Reuter.

Houston, Monday
THE shuttle Discovery hovered 44ft from Russia's Mir space station
tonight at the climax of an orbital rendezvous that will set the stage
for a historic linkup in June.
Shuttle commander Jim Wetherbee and veteran cosmonaut Vladimir Titov
waved from the shuttle at the cheering, laughing Mir crew as they
approached the orbiting outpost.
Wetherbee parked the shuttle in front of Mir and the two craft
travelled in tandem at 17,500 mph from darkness into sunlight high above
the southern tip of Kamchatka and the northern tip of Japan.
They maintained the position for about 10 minutes, then the shuttle
backed away from Mir and circled the space station at 400ft while crew
members made a photographic survey.
Less than three hours before the delicate dance was to begin, the
Russian Space Agency gave approval for the close approach.
The decision came after three days of negotiations between American
and Russian engineers. The Russians had feared that the nine-year-old
space station would be damaged by fuel which was leaking from a steering
jet on the space shuttle.
The shuttle crew includes Lincolnshire-born Dr Michael Foale, 38, who
emigrated in 1982 to become an astronaut.--Reuter

MEAT from livestock treated with illegal growth-promoting drugs could
be undetectable by sport dope tests, and give competitors an edge, a
leading nutritionist said yesterday.
Dr Ron Maughan, the Aberdeen-based chairman of the British Olympic
Association's nutrition steering group, was speaking on the eve of
publication of a Consumers' Association report which confirms the
presence in British meat of illegal growth hormone and other drugs.
The CA report says that tests showed traces of synthetic growth
hormones in just over one in 100 UK steak samples. Three in 100 liver
samples tested positive for the hormone Clenbuterol, and there were
higher levels in meat bought in countries often visited by Britons.
Dr Maughan believes that long-term eating of meat from livestock
treated with some illegal drugs could give a beneficial effect to sport
competitors, yet escape detection in drug tests.
Clenbuterol is the drug that brought a ban on the German world
champion sprinter, Katrin Krabbe, and saw two British weightlifters sent
home from the Olympics.
Growth-promoting hormones increase the amount of lean meat on animals
and help maximise farmers' profits. But they are banned in the European
Union because of potential risks to human health.
Each country is supposed to make regular checks to ensure such
hormones are not illegally used, but consumer groups in Europe suggest
that the monitoring is not working, said the CA's magazine, Which? way
to Health.
The highest levels were found in Belgian and Spanish meat samples,
added the report. The CA says tourists should avoid Spanish calf or beef
liver.

Police said the three-year-old boy, looking as he did every evening for

26 weeks pregnant, was rushed to hospital in a coma and later gave birth
to a baby weighing less than 2lb. The mother is still in a critical

After day-long talks in Brussels, they won a major concession from the

Greece agreed to look again at its long-standing veto of an EU-Turkish

<HEADLINE>Fox hunting is banned on National Trust land</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE National Trust for Scotland has decided to ban fox hunting on the
only patch of its land where the sport has been carried on.
It is withdrawing permission for the Fife Fox-Hounds to hunt over the
trust's 500-acre Hill of Tarvit estate, near Cupar.
The Advocates for Animals organisation, part of The League Against
Cruel Sports, said it now hoped the English National Trust would follow
the Scottish example.
Spokesman Les Ward said: ''Although the Fife hunt didn't utilise this
land to a great extent, the principle is an important one and we now
look for the English National Trust to follow the Scottish lead.''
The ban, decided by a majority last Friday but announced only
yesterday, comes about 10 weeks before a motion at the trust's annual
general meeting in Troon on April 22 calling for a ban.
Mr Ward said that as a trust member he had gathered more than 40
signatures in support of a motion.
''I just don't think that they had the stomach for a fight at the
agm,'' Mr Ward said. ''But we welcome the council's decision. We are
very pleased, but it is not before time.''
In view of the decision the motion has been withdrawn.
A spokesman for the trust said that although permission had previously
been given for fox hunting on the estate, only one hunt had taken place
there in the past eight years.
''It doesn't happen anywhere else. No-one has asked. It was thought it
might as well stop on this estate,'' he said.
The spokesman said the Hill of Tarvit mansionhouse, with its 500 acres
of gardens, forest and farmland, was given to the trust in 1949 by its
woman owner. She had allowed hunts, and the trust had inherited the
tradition.
The trust spokesman said the council's discussion was limited to the
situation on Hill of Tarvit. ''They didn't discuss the wider issue of
hunting in the general sense because there is no need to,'' he said.
However, Mr Ward said he hoped the trust would apply the same ban to
all its land in the future and it would never allow ''this barbaric
practice'' to happen on it.
A spokesman for the British Field Sports Society in Scotland, which
looks after the interests of hunting, shooting, fishing and falconry,
said: ''This is not a ban on hunting, but an administrative closure
because the Fife hunt didn't utilise the facilities.''
One of four joint masters of the Fife Fox-Hounds, Mr Pat Laird, said:
''We are very sad about this decision, but it is not a bit of ground we
have used in the last 10 years or so.
''That has just been out of choice. The main Aberdeen-London railway
line and several roads are close there and it is also an area of
intensive livestock farming.
''We hunt on the East of Fife and there are plenty of foxes. But it is
a sad thing when the family who owned the land were very keen and good
supporters of fox-hunting when they were there.''

JOHANNESBURG: Archbishop Desmond Tutu yesterday demanded a police
inquiry into #80,000 donated by American singer Paul Simon to a charity
for disadvantaged children in South Africa. ''We are distressed and
angry that money set aside for child victims of apartheid cannot be
accounted for immediately,'' he said in a joint statement with Mary
Burton, a fellow trustee of Allan Boesak's scandal-hit Foundation for
Peace and Justice. Tutu said there was no record of the whereabouts of
Simon's donation from his Graceland tour. The foundation, run by Boesak,
Pretoria's former ambassador designate to the United Nations, is already
being investigated over the alleged mismanagement of Danish aid funds.

A BUS company owned by the Stagecoach group has been banned from
operating one of its services in Ayrshire after a long dispute with a
tiny rival.
The Scottish Traffic Commissioner announced yesterday that Western
Scottish Buses had been found in breach of regulations and, from the end
of this month, would be prohibited from running any registered service
on the route between Ayr and Dalmellington.
Local MP George Foulkes said the ''unprecedented decision'' should be
a warning to the Perth-based Stagecoach empire which he claimed was
trying to create a private monopoly over vast areas of Britain.
Department of Transport staff spent several months monitoring services
on the route after rival operator Carrick Coaches, which has a staff of
12, claimed that Stagecoach and its Western Scottish subsidiary were
deliberately using unfair practices to force it off the road.
Western Scottish had applied to operate a variation on its registered
service on the route, namely an increased frequency of service on the
section between Ayr and Patna, and had been given an official start date
of December 27.
But a check carried out earlier that month suggested that the company
had introduced the variation in advance of the official date, according
to a statement issued yesterday on behalf of the Scottish Traffic
Commissioner, Mr Michael Betts, outlining his findings following a
public inquiry held last week in Glasgow.
It stated that, at the inquiry, the company maintained it was not
operating the variation, only additional buses (or duplicates) on the
existing service.
However, Mr Betts found it ''amazing'' that the times of the
additional vehicles always coincided with the times of the short
workings (Ayr to Patna) due to come into force in the new timetable
rather than being operated, as laid down in the regulations, as closely
as possible to the timings in the registered timetable.
Although there was no requirement in the regulations that additional
vehicles should only run due to passenger demand, it was clear that this
was not a factor in the extra vehicles being operated. Mr Betts pointed
out that a new regulation which came into force last week did introduce
passenger demand as a requirement for the operation of additional
vehicles.
The commissioner concluded that nothing he had heard at the inquiry
had persuaded him that the company had a reasonable excuse for its
conduct.
Western Scottish, which was bought by Stagecoach in July last year,
yesterday said it was ''extremely disappointed'' by the commissioner's
decision. Managing director Mr Alan Wilson said: ''We feel that it is a
heavy penalty for what we thought were minor infringements of the rules
regarding duplication.''
The regulations on duplication were not clear, he said, and the
company believed it had been acting legally. He refuted any suggestion
that Western Scottish had been trying to drive the opposition off the
road.
Mr Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley, said the
commissioner's decision showed that ''even the most powerful private bus
operator cannot flout the law''. He added: ''It ought to be a shot
across the bows for Stagecoach.''
But his top priority was to ensure that the people of Doon Valley did
not suffer as a consequence. Carrick Coaches had assured him that it was
willing and able to provide a service of the same frequency and cost as
specified in the original licence, if it was granted it by the
commissioner.
Mr Michael Dobbins, owner of Carrick Coaches, could not be contacted
for comment yesterday.

ANIMAL rights campaigners are investigating reports that exporters may
be trying to ship calves for European veal production via Stranraer to
avoid the protests at English ports, it was revealed yesterday.
The campaigners pledged that, if information they had received turned
out to be correct, they would organise a picket at the Ayrshire port and
prevent the animals being shipped out.
However, ferry operators at Stranraer said they had banned such
shipments several months ago, and were confident that their own strict
procedures would ensure the ban was enforced.
The port was cited in information passed to Scottish campaigners by an
animal rights group in Cumbria which has been concerned about the
shipment of live animals from the Isle of Man to the English mainland.
Mr John Robins, organising secretary of Animal Concern (Scotland),
said he had been told by the English group that calves were being taken
from the Isle of Man to Heysham in Lancashire, and then transported by
road to Stranraer to be shipped to Larne in Northern Ireland.
From there, it was possible that they were being taken to Belfast
airport for flights to the Continent, or taken to one of the ports in
the south of the Irish republic and then shipped to the Continent.
He said: ''We are still trying to get these bits and pieces of
information confirmed. But if it is true, we will mobilise peaceful
pickets at Stranraer and lobby the port authorities.''
Anita Simpson, spokeswoman for the Animal Rights Cumbria group, said
the information they had passed on to Mr Robins had come from two
separate sources. She added: ''We can not clarify this information at
the present time.''
But ferry operators at Stranraer and at nearby Cairnryan yesterday
pointed out that they had stopped accepting this kind of cargo several
months ago.
A spokesman for Stena Sealink, which operates a Stranraer-Larne
service, said the company no longer carried any animals intended for
slaughter on the Continent, and this included the veal trade.
Meanwhile, Irish agriculture minister Ivan Yates yesterday requested a
report on the implications of a decision by a ferry firm to halt animal
shipments to a British port.
Dublin-based Irish Ferries stopped taking bookings for transporting
livestock to Holyhead in Anglesey after assessing the position at other
British ports hit by protesting animal welfare campaigners.
The Irish Farmers' Association protested at the decision and urged
action by Britain against ''the mobs of extremists who have run amok and
illegally forced closure of British ports to the legitimate transport of
Irish cattle''.
Police were yesterday investigating the discovery of three incendiary
devices attached to lorries used by a firm of livestock transporters at
Billing, near Northampton.
The devices failed to ignite and no one was hurt. A police
spokeswoman, who declined to name the firm, said no one had claimed
responsibility.

A LEADING businessman has been left with a major question mark against
his business reputation following a Government decision that he was not
a fit and proper person to run a major life assurance company.
A judge has rejected a claim by Mr Richard Buchanan, a former managing
director of the Life Association of Scotland, that he was treated
unfairly by the Department of Trade and Industry.
Lord Osborne was told at the Court of Session that Mr Buchanan had
spent many years in the insurance industry. He joined the Life
Association of Scotland in 1989 and became managing director the
following year.
He remained with the company until October 1993 when LAS was acquired
by Britannia Life.
Mr Buchanan, of Essex Road, Barnton, Edinburgh, was then appointed
chief executive of N &amp; P Life Assurance, but in February last year the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry indicated that he was
considering serving a notice of objection to the appointment.
Mr Heseltine said that, acting on comments received from LAS's
appointed actuary, Mr Raymond Paul, he believed that, as managing
director of LAS, Mr Buchanan had pursued a policy which was detrimental
to the prudential interests of the company.
The Minister also took the view that Mr Buchanan had failed to alert
the DTI promptly to LAS's worsening financial position.
Mr Buchanan wrote to the DTI opposing the serving of the notice and
attended a meeting with his lawyer to put his case.
However, on March 31, Mr Heseltine proceeded to serve the notice of
objection to Mr Buchanan's appointment with N &amp; P on the ground that he
was not a fit and proper person to become chief executive.
The Secretary of State accepted that Mr Buchanan had not wilfully
intended LAS to break any regulatory rules and had not given direct
instructions that underwriting procedures should be waived.
Mr Buchanan went to the Court of Session asking Lord Osborne to set
aside the notice of objection. He argued that his treatment at the hands
of the DTI was irregular and contrary to natural justice.
0 Mr Buchanan claimed he had not been given sufficient warning of the
allegations against him and that the DTI had made no effort to check the
accuracy of the actuary's allegations by contacting any other source
within LAS.
In a written judgment rejecting Mr Buchanan's arguments, Lord Osborne
said: ''It appears to me that in this case there was an extensive
disclosure of the gist of the case which Mr Buchanan had to answer.''
A spokesman for N &amp; P Life said Mr Buchanan had resigned for health
reasons in April last year.

STAFF and patrons at an Edinburgh restaurant were last night mourning
the deaths of its owner and her two young children who died when her car
was in collision with an articulated lorry.
It was yesterday before many of the clientele of The Shore restaurant
and bar in Leith, as well as business colleagues, learned that the
victims of the crash were its proprietor Philippa Cruikshank, 37, and
her children, four-year-old Alexa Linsley and one-year-old Mark Linsley.
Her customers knew her as a sparkling hostess, who had built up the
reputation of The Shore as a fashionable eating-place since she and
chartered accountant Mr Simon Edington took it over as partners about
seven years ago.
She became sole owner last autumn, by which time the restaurant had
established an enviable name for its food and atmosphere in revitalised
Leith.
Prior to going into licensed catering, Philippa Cruikshank worked for
the Edinburgh natural and organic foods business, Real Foods, as an
administrative assistant then as sales manager of the wholesale side. Mr
Edington also worked for Real Foods.
The owner of Real Foods, Mr Michael Fox, and his wife, Charlotte, were
among those who only learned of her death yesterday.
''We'd been friends for many years and she was godmother to my
daughter'', Mrs Fox said. ''She really knew a lot about food and was a
super cook and a great hostess and entertainer. It is a terrible tragedy
to have happened.''
Ms Cruikshank kept her own name for business purposes, though married
to architect Mr Stuart Linsley. The couple and their children lived near
Humbie, East Lothian.
A former employee at The Shore described her as ''a great boss with a
heart of gold''.
The accident happened on Sunday on the A68 road near Earlston, in the
Borders, as mother and children headed southwards in a Vauxhall Astra to
visit friends in the North of England. Police are seeking witnesses.

<HEADLINE>Range of drugs 'available at rave club' Youngsters tell inquiry of buying ecstasy tablets and speed during fatal night at Hanger 13</HEADLINE>

A RANGE of drugs was available at an Ayr club the night a teenager
took ill and died after a rave, a fatal accident inquiry was told
yesterday at Ayr Sheriff Court.
The inquiry, before Sheriff Neil Gow, QC, was told by a number of
young witnesses that they had bought and consumed ecstasy tablets and
amphetamine sulphate, known as speed, at the Hanger 13 event on the
night of April 30 last year.
That night Mr John Nisbet, 18, from New Cumnock, and Mr Andrew Dick,
19, from Glasgow took ill. They died later in Ayr Hospital.
The inquiry will take up to two weeks to look into the events
surrounding their deaths, and that of Mr Andrew Stoddart, 20, who
visited the club almost four months later.
Opening the inquiry Sheriff Gow said: ''This is an important case
which may raise matters of wide public interest. It is important to the
families, relatives and friends, important to the club owners, and
important in the public interest.''
He told the inquiry that, after hearing all the evidence and any
submissions, he would make a judicial determination and that he might or
might not be in a position to make recommendations which might affect
future rave events.
Miss Gillian McCann, 20, of Ashmark Avenue, New Cumnock, told the
inquiry that she had gone to Hanger 13 with Mr John Nisbet and a number
of other friends, and that on the way had drunk a bottle of Buckfast
wine.
She said that around eight of her group had given money over to buy
ecstasy tablets, which she described as small and white with a little
dove on them.
Miss McCann, who said she had taken ecstasy tablets before the
tragedy, but not since, said: ''It makes you feel good. It makes you
feel happy. It gives you energy.''
She said that she had been frisked before entering the club, and later
had taken one of the pills. She said she thought that Mr Nisbet had
taken one and a half of the pills.
Later in the evening she saw him outside being tended by two bouncers
''shaking, and unable to talk''.
She added that the tablets took 20 minutes to work and the effect
lasted ''quite a while''. That night Mr Nisbet was wearing a fluorescent
railman's jacket and jogging trousers, which would have made him
extremely warm while he was dancing.
Asked by Mr James Reid, solicitor for the club, if water had been
available to drink, as one of the effects of ecstasy was dehydration
Miss McCann replied: ''Aye, you could get it at the bar or from the tap
in the toilet.''
Another of the group, Mr Thomas Bradford, 18, of Connell Park, New
Cumnock, said that he had gathered money from his friends and given it
to another person in exchange for between six and nine ecstasy tablets.
He said he had taken one of the tablets, but had suffered no ill
effects.
Earlier Mr Nisbet's mother, Jean, 41, told the inquiry that earlier
that week her son had been unwell after having four teeth extracted.
On Saturday afternoon, before he went to the rave, his stomach was
still bothering him.
She told the inquiry that, as far as she knew, he did not take drugs.
Wiping away tears Mrs Nisbet said: ''He was the same happy-go-lucky
John. I never saw any difference in him to make me suspect he was doing
anything like that.''
She told the inquiry that she had been called to Ayr Hospital in the
early hours of May 1 and learned that her son was in the high dependency
unit. He died at 11.30am that day.
Mr Allan Jack, 23, of Seaton Terrace, Irvine, said he bought four
''Eccies'' in the balcony area, paying #12 for each of them, and ended
up in hospital that night.
He told the inquiry he had been taking ecstasy for about five years,
that on one occasion he had taken seven tablets, and that he was still
taking ecstasy.
The sheriff asked what effect the drug had on him and Mr Jack replied:
''It makes you pure full of it . . . it makes you mad with it.''
Asked by Mr Reid if a Saturday night would not be complete without
ecstasy, he replied: ''No, it would be boring without it.''
His brother, Colin, told the inquiry that Allan was in ''very bad
condition'' after taking the tablets that night and that he had seen
bouncers trying to lift him up and pour water into his mouth.
Ms Claire Docherty, 20, a student, of Ferguslie Park Crescent,
Paisley, said that she was given half of an ecstasy tablet by a youth
she met at the dance and had no recollection of what happened next.
''From what I was told I collapsed, had convulsions, and was taken to
Ayr Hospital.''
Three witnesses told the inquiry they took speed which they had bought
inside.
Mr Gordon Howat, 18, of Laglaff Farm, New Cumnock, said that he and
his friends had one gramme of speed each.
While they were waiting in the queue outside the club, two of them had
seen a bouncer taking a bag of drugs off a person at the rave, and smash
it up with his feet and his torch.
The inquiry was adjourned until today to allow Sheriff Gow to inspect
the interior of Hanger 13, which is sited in the Pavilion, just yards
from the court.

TRACES of legionella bacteria have been found at the showpiece Time
Capsule leisure centre in Coatbridge. The environmental health
department of Monklands District Council has shut the pool and shower
area while a thorough decontamination programme is carried out.
Bacteria samples were discovered during a routine inspection, and the
results were given to the Time Capsule yesterday morning. Lanarkshire
Health Board has advised any recent patrons of the pool who feel unwell
to visit their local doctor.
As yet no cases of legionella have been reported, but the health board
is monitoring the situation. A joint statement by the district council
and The Time Capsule said: ''Although no cases of illness have been
reported, and we do not as yet know the exact details of the bacterium,
the facility will not re-open until we are absolutely satisfied that no
health risk to the public exists.''
It is understood that traces of legionella bacterium were discovered
in swabs taken from the centre's shower heads 10 days ago, as the
bacterium has an incubation period of around this time. In order to
treat the problem the management at the Time Capsule is chlorinating the
water system.
A new set of tests is expected to be taken today to see whether the
bacterium has been eliminated. However the pool and showers are expected
to be shut for at least a week. The ice rink and dry sports area will
remain open.
Monklands District Council's environmental services carry out routine
testing for legionella in all its sporting and leisure facilities. This
is the first time the bacterium has been discovered at The Time Capsule.
Mr Gordon Kirk, general manager of The Time Capsule said: ''The
samples were only discovered in one place, which was the shower heads.
This is seemingly the most common place for samples like this to arise.
We have shut the pool because you can't keep it open and not provide
showers.
''What is happening now is that we don't know where it is coming from,
and so we are chlorinating the whole system tonight and there will be
more tests taken tomorrow. We imagine that this part of the centre will
be closed for at least a week.
''It's not good news, but the Time Capsule is a place where people
come to enjoy themselves and their safety must be our immediate concern.
It's going to cost us a lot of money, but it has to be done. If there is
just a possibility that there is a danger to the public then that is
enough.''
A spokesman for Lanarkshire Health Board said: ''There have been no
cases of legionella reported to the Lanarkshire Health Board and neither
is there anyone suffering from legionella in any of our units.
''However we would advise anybody who is feeling unwell, and who has
had contact with the Time Capsule, to go and see their own doctor. The
situation is being monitored carefully by the board's health medicine
staff.''

THE Government yesterday named the chairmen of three new water quangos
and was immediately accused of showing contempt for local democracy.
The quangos will run water and sewerage services after April 1996 and
the criticism came from political opponents and the trade unions.
The part-time chairmen will be paid a total of more than #100,000 a
year. Two will get #40,000 each for working two and a half days a week,
while the other receives #24,000 for one and a half days a week.
SNP vice president Andrew Welsh immediately claimed Scotland's water
had been quangoed and Scottish Secretary Ian Lang's placemen had got
their snouts in the money trough.
''Where is the cost effectiveness in paying obscene sums for a job
that the elected chairs of water and sewerage committees have been doing
for a fraction of the cost?'', he asked.
The appointments were defended by Mr Lang, who said high-calibre
individuals would give the best leadership.
Removing water services from council control was one of the most
bitterly opposed parts of the legislation to reorganise local government
which went through Parliament last year.
As Mr Lang was giving details of the appointments, the Citizen's
Charter Minister, Mr David Hunt, was proposing a more open approach to
appointments to public bodies when he gave evidence to the Nolan
Committee.
The chairman of the new East of Scotland water authority will be
62-year-old Dr Ian Preston, who is retiring from his #255,000 a year
post as chief executive of ScottishPower.
As water authority chairman he will be paid #24,000 a year for an
average of one and a half days work a week.
The chairman of the West of Scotland Water Authority will be Mr John
Jameson, 61, a chartered surveyor who is a former convener of Dumfries
and Galloway Regional Council.
He will be paid #40,000 a year for an average two and half days work a
week.
The present chairman of the Highland Health Board, Mr John Robertson,
who is 65, will become the part-time head of the North of Scotland Water
Authority at a salary of #40,000 a year.
Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson MP said: ''These
are the usual quango suspects plucked from Ian Lang's pocket to run
Scottish water services at lavish salaries.''
He pledged they would only remain in charge until the General Election
when Labour would return water to locally elected control.
Unison, the public services union, which represents the majority of
water services staff, said replacing full-time elected representatives
by part-time appointees did not meet Scotland's water needs and was a
kick in the teeth for the Scottish people.
It feared the pressure on the new boards to use private sector
investment was simply a precursor to full-scale privatisation as had
happened in England and Wales.
The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Jim Wallace MP, said the
unelected quango state marched on. His party would restore water
services to local, accountable and democratic control.
Mr Lang emphasised that the new authorities would be encouraged to
make use of private finance for major projects.
''The appointment of such high-calibre individuals to the chairmanship
of the three new authorities will give the best possible leadership for
the tasks ahead.''
Mr Jameson said last night his appointment had come as a considerable
surprise given his vocal opposition to the government's plan for such a
body in the first place.
''I was opposed to this idea all the way along but now it has become
law I think the best way for me to act is to ensure that it works in the
best possible way from within.''
A ScottishPower spokesperson said Dr Preston would be developing a
number of interests on his retiral from the company.
''He's very keen to establish a broad, balanced portfolio of interests
in a range of fields, and is very determined to avoid being involved in
the political sphere,'' the spokesperson said.
''He sees the new water authority purely in business terms, and
believes he has been brought in to run a business.''

THE 16-year-old son of Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart has been
reported to the procurator-fiscal for alleged contravention of the
Firearms Act.
This follows an incident at the weekend when the Minister had heated
exchanges with a group of people protesting over the M77 motorway
extension, when Mr Stewart senior grabbed a pickaxe.
A Strathclyde police spokesman confirmed last night that Jack Stewart,
16, and another youth, David Clow, 16, had been reported to the
procurator-fiscal.
''We can confirm that two 16-year-old males are the subject of a
report to the procurator-fiscal in connection with alleged
contraventions of the 1968 Firearms Act, following an incident in the
Pollok Castle Wood, Newton Mearns, at about 16.00 on Sunday, February
5,'' the spokesman said.
On Sunday, Mr Stewart met the motorway protesters when he visited the
site of the proposed M77 extension in Pollok Castle Wood. The Scottish
Industry Minister picked up a pickaxe and a protester claims that he was
pushed.
A report on that incident has already gone to the procurator-fiscal,
and yesterday the Crown Office said it had not ruled out the possibility
of legal proceedings.
A spokesman for the Crown Office in Edinburgh said that further
inquiries were being made to ascertain whether legal action should be
taken.
''A report on the incident has been received by the fiscal and subject
to further inquiries being completed, no decision has been reached
whether criminal proceedings will indeed be brought,'' the spokesman
said.
''Until these inquiries are completed, nothing will take place. It is
not known how long this will, in fact, take.''
Mr Stewart pledged he would return in the next few days to the Newton
Mearns camp and insisted that he had no regrets.
He maintained that he was simply ''exercising my right as the MP for
Eastwood to walk legally and peacefully in my constituency''.
Despite the clash, Mr Stewart emphasised that he intended to return
and said he would be happy to meet the protesters ''in a peaceable way
to hear their concerns''.
However, Mr Lindsay Keenan, 30, a member of the Earth First! group
which is trying to prevent the felling of trees on the proposed
extension to the M77, said that the Minister would not be made welcome.
''If Mr Stewart wants to publicly debate the motorway plan then we
would be more than happy to meet him. Otherwise we don't want to see
him,'' he said.
In the House of Commons Mr Stewart was accused by a Labour MP of
having behaved in an ''extraordinary and loutish'' way.
Mr Mike Watson (Glasgow Central) demanded a Government statement on
behaviour which was ''unbecoming of a Government Minister''.
However, the Speaker, Miss Betty Boothroyd replied: ''I have not had
any instructions from the Government that they are seeking to make a
statement of that nature.''
Mr George Robertson, the Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, had
earlier written to Mr Ian Lang, seeking an ''urgent and thorough''
inquiry over Mr Stewart's use of a Scottish Office press officer to
explain the incident.
Mr Lang dismissed the call, and said that the Scottish Office was
never involved in issuing a statement to the media.
''I am surprised that you should yourself rush your own letter to the
press without either the courtesy or common sense to check the facts
first.
''Scottish Office press officers are very well aware of the Cabinet
Office rules which preclude any activity on their part in support of
Ministers in a personal or party political capacity,'' Mr Lang replied.
The incident has led to questions about the security of Ministers and
the wisdom of going into potentially hazardous situations.
Mr Stewart's unescorted visit was similar to trips made by Mr Lang
last month, when he made unannounced tours of areas of Strathclyde hit
by December's floods.
The Scottish Office insisted that Mr Stewart was acting as an MP
dealing with a constituency matter.
A spokesman declined to comment on the security implications, stating
that it was ''not appropriate on security grounds to discuss the
security arrangements of Ministers''.
Similarly, Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservative
and Unionist Association, said: ''These matters are continually reviewed
in the light of prevailing circumstances. However, in the first
instance, it is a matter for the Government.''
Three anti-motorway campaigners, a male and two females, are the

ABERDEEN manager Willie Miller was sacked yesterday after nearly 25
years with the club he joined as a player.
0 There was clearly no love lost as an emotional Miller departed the
club for the last time with a scathing attack on the board, which
announced its decision after a three-hour meeting, but had hinted at the
possibility over the weekend.
The captain who held aloft the European Cup Winner's Cup in 1983 in
the Dons' greatest moment accused chairman Ian Donald of making his
position untenable by undermining his authority. As the speculation
started about his possible successor Miller, who spent #1.8m on players,
named lack of finance as a factor in his failure.
''The expectations of the fans are to challenge the Old Firm, but
Aberdeen does not have the finance to do that,'' he said. ''They know I
would have sweated blood to bring success here.
''Now that Celtic have sorted themselves out, they can spend more than
us. The whole game in Scotland has changed, and Aberdeen must change to
compete.''
The announcement of Miller's sacking from his #90,000-a-year job was
made by chairman Ian Donald who read a brief statement.
