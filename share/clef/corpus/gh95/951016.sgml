CLYDESDALE Harriers' coach Brian McAusland earned the plaudits after
his team's victory in the SAF Western District Cross Country Relay
Championships at Lenzie.
This was Clydesdale's first relay title since the Championships were
inaugurated in 1926 and they earned it in unorthodox fashion.
They fielded three British 800 metres internationals -- Ewan Calvert,
Des Roache and Grant Graham -- together with club champion James Austin
and their speed over a tough, testing course was decisive in defeating
more established favourites.
Clydesdale led at half way with their B team third thanks to two other
international 800 metre runners, Shane Daly and Kheridene Idessane.
Austin was given a 38 second lead by his clubmates when setting off on
the final lap and although Shettleston's Graeme Wight ran the fastest
lap of the day he was still eight seconds behind at the finish.
City of Glasgow AC won the women's title with their team recording
three of the four fastest lap times. They also gained the bronze medals
with their B team.
After taking three of the first four places in last week's McAndrew
Relay, Leslie Deans Racing Club threw down the gauntlet to their rivals
in the Eastern District Championships at Gorebridge.
Captain Allan Robson skillfully allocated his runners in an effort to
take all first three places in the race.
Their top team won by almost two minutes thanks to excellent runs from
David Ross, Glen Stewart and John Robson who recorded the three fastest
times of the day.
Their B team finished runners-up with only Teviotdale Harriers from
Hawick, fielding their strongest possible team, breaking up the
attempted clean sweep.
Aberdeen AAC won the women's title for the second time in three years,
finishing a massive two minutes nineteen seconds clear of Stirling
University. Debbie Kilner took the fastest lap award, over half a minute
clear of clubmate Heather Grant.
Keith and District AC were the surprise winners in the North District
Championships at Inverness.

Vision Group
EDINBURGH-based Vision is a world leader in low cost, silicon-based,
integrated camera chips and produces a camera on a single microchip.
The application opportunties are diverse and each market is
potentially large. Company broker Albert E Sharp says the shares are a
buy at 187p, now 177p. Sharp points out that the development of higher
resolution monochrome, and, most importantly, colour technologies are on
target. These include tiny surveillance and portable PC image motion
capture cameras.
Currently marginally loss-making, Vision should make profits of #3m
for 1996-97 when sales will leap from the #1.7m of last year to #22m.

Shell
BZW recommends being generally underweight in the oil sector but the
brokerage house has some definite likes and dislikes among the stocks.
Shell is out of favour at 744p. From a low in 1992, Shell's earnings
have increased sharply to a projected #4800m this year. The rate of
earnings growth is thought likely to slow down in future years.
The recovery in chemicals has accounted for about #1500m of the
approximately #2200m underlying increase in profits before exceptional
items and currency movements. The balance, from the oil business, has
reflected substantial cost-cutting offset by price and margin erosion.

Robert Wiseman Dairies
TAKE profits in the shares at 154p, recommends Edinburgh broker Bell
Lawrie White.
Bell Lawrie says the company is feeling margin pressure after the
acquisition of Hamilton Dairies, the third-largest dairy in Scotland.
The broker expects Wiseman to close Hamilton's dairy and put the
associated volumes through its large Motherwell plant.
Closure costs are likely to neutralise the positive effects of the
acquisition in the current year. Margins are thought to be squeezed by
both input prices and pressure on selling prices. In addition, Bell
Lawrie continues to believe that Wiseman's high quality and prospects
are more than reflected in the share price.

PSIT
DESPITE low earnings growth over the next two years, property analysts
at UBS expect PSIT to provide double the sector dividend growth.
However, the high exposure to industrial property will result in poor
net asset value growth over the same period. Although this will leave
the share price on discounts one third higher than the sector average,
in the opinion of UBS, it still leaves it looking expensive on a two
year view and therefore it remains a seller of the shares at 137p.
use as 10pt wob Sherwood Group
DESPITE a mixed market background, levels of demand and order books
are generally encouraging. Bell Lawrie White recommends the stock as a
buy at 117p.
The interim results were much as expected with turnover rising 12% to
#85m and pre-tax profits 21% to #7.24m. Lace operations showed a
combination of organic growth and recovery but UK garments suffered from
poor retail sales.
The broker believes the first-half recovery will be sustained and is
looking for profits of #17.5m for 1995 and #19m for 1996.
use as 10pt wob
Sun Alliance
WITH around half its profits coming from the UK, this insurer is
vulnerable to the downturn and structural changes taking place in the
home market. Smith New Court recommends selling the shares at 365p (now
355p) as it is cautious about the outlook for the next six months.
The broker points out that Sun Alliance has moved back into a position
of excess capital relative to its total premium income. It needs to make
an acquisition in order to ensure long-term dividend growth. The broker
sees profits rising from #31.6m to #49.9m this year but then dropping
back to #38.6m in 1996.
use as 10pt wob
Kenwood Appliances
THE RATING of 10.2 times 1996 earnings afforded to Kenwood shares at
240p reflects concern about current trading in certain markets and
recent management changes but understates the value of the international
brands and a prudent strategic investment in low-cost manufacturing,
according to Albert E Sharp. Kenwood has acquired a factory in China
which will give it significant competitive advantage over Continental
competitors which use Chinese subcontractors. Sharp is forecasting a
rise in profits from #13.5m to #16.4m for the year to next March, with
#18.3m in 1995/96.
use as 10pt wob
Thorn EMI
GOLDMAN Sachs believe the shares will continue to be a moderate
outperformer in the long term. Talk of a demerger has boosted the
group's shares throughout much of this year.
Goldman thinks a demerger will be in the long-term interests of the
operating companies and the shareholders. The issue is thought not to be
the viability of demerger but the upside offered at the current share
price of 1452p.
For some time Goldman has argued that Thorn EMI is undervalued given
that, first, improving music margins warranted some multiple expansion
and, second, that a large part of the market capitalisation could be
justified through applying historic industry exit multiples to the
recorded music and music publishing interests.

<PAGE>16</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975863932</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THIS week is a quiet for company results with the inflow slowing to a
trickle and no FTSE-100 companies due.
The spotlight is on today's figures from the Famous Grouse whisky
producer Highland Distilleries.
''Highland's results will show a muted performance overall, with an
increase of only 3% in both pre-tax profits and earnings per share,''
said broker NatWest Securities.
It reckons in the year to the end of August, taxable profits edged up
to #43.8m from #42.5m in the previous 12 months. Market projections
generally range from #42.5m to #44.4m. Shareholders are likely to see
their dividend increase to 7.8p/8p from 7.3p.
Also reporting today is Waste Management International with
third-quarter results -- the first figures under its new management
team.
NatWest believes profits in the three months to the end of September
will be flat at #43m. It is thought that trading remains mixed.
Wessex Water, in which Waste Management has a 20% stake, and UK Waste
are both performing well but its operations in France and Italy ''remain
in turmoil,'' the broker said.
The seemingly relentless rise of Farnell Electronics, which publishes
its interim results today, should continue and a sharp in profits is
expected.
Analysts will be keen to know the progress the group has made
expanding in North America and how its acquisition in May of CPC, an
electronics spare parts distributor, is faring.
Broker Henderson Crosthwaite reckons earnings for the six months to
the end of July will jump to #36m from #27.7m. The interim dividend
could be lifted from 3.8p to 4.2p according to the market consensus.
Henry Boot, the housebuilder and construction group, is likely to
provide further pessimism tomorrow about a pick-up in the near future in
the housing market.
Its interim results follow recent results from John Maunders, which
predicted there would be no improvement in the housing market before
Christmas at the earliest.
Broker UBS thinks Henry Boot's interim pre-tax profits during the six
months to the end of June improved to #2.8m from #2.3m in the
corresponding period last year. Investors could see their interim
payouts increase from 1.85p per share to 2.05p.
A similar picture of the housing market is likely to be painted on
Thursday by another builder, MJ Gleeson. But, in contrast to Boot, the
bottom-line figures are likely to be less rosy.
The City expects full-year profits for the year to the end of June to
be #8.2m, down from #8.9m in the previous 12 months. Despite the
projected fall, the dividend payout should rise from 14.2p to 15p.
An insight into the state of consumer spending power and people's
willingness to spend money will be provided on Wednesday with annual
figures from furniture retailer and manufacturer DFS.
Broker Panmure Gordon reckons the Doncaster-based group saw taxable
profits in the year to the end of July climb to #26m from #21.4m
previously. For investors, the improved performance could mean a penny
increase in the dividend to 8.2p.
For food producer and processor Albert Fisher, broker UBS has
pencilled in slightly lower full-year profits when it reports on
Thursday. It thinks annual results during the year to the end of August
will show pre-tax profits down to #32.7m from #34.8m.
As far the dividend is concerned, this could rise from 3.71p to 3.75p.

TOM MARSHALL predicts that a new piece of equipment is about to appear
in High Street electrical showrooms.
Alongside televisions, dishwashers and other pieces of household
equipment, Tom Marshall hopes to have a clean air machine which he says
will help asthma sufferers available for rent at #1 a day.
The machine has already been in use in the United States for five
years but a company, Clean Air Healthcare, based in Glasgow, has been
formed to introduce the equipment into Europe.
''We hope to rent the equipment designed for asthma sufferers for
around #1 a day,'' he said. ''In return for this rental we will instal
and maintain the equipment.''
The Glasgow company HF Electrical is the registered installer of the
units, and its engineers have been trained to ensure that the equipment
remains effective and trouble free.
Plans are also under way to have the equipment tested at Gartnavel
under laboratory conditions to prove its effectiveness in helping
Britain's three million asthma sufferers.
The machine is designed to remove the tiny particles from the air
which causes asthma attacks, and can be placed in sufferers bedrooms.
It the tests prove the manufacturer's claims then the equipment could
become available on the NHS.
A larger industrial version can also be used in offices, restaurants
and bars to remove smoke from rooms and lounges.
''The equipment,'' says Tom, a qualified electrical engineer, ''will
remove tobacco smoke from public houses even with windows closed.''
Tests have already been carried out in the offices of leading
companies, and Tom believes once installed the clean air machines could
remove the sight of cigarette smokers huddled outside buildings.
The equipment will not be for sale, but for rent. The reason for this
says Tom Marshall is that it is vital that it is maintained properly in
order to ensure that it remains effective.

JOHN O'DONNELL is off to Amsterdam next month as part of a Strathclyde
Business Development trade mission to the Europort.
John, right, is convinced the visit will help to launch his new
venture Scientific Model Propellers (Scotland) which is aimed at taking
advantage in the expected growth of the European shipbuilding industry.
John, who was manager of the Denny Tank Musuem, Dumbarton, recreates
mini propellers to his clients' specifications which are then put
through their paces in one of the 30 experimental tank sites throughout
Europe.
The tanks are used by shipbuilding companies to test miniature
versions of ship parts to see how they perform, and John has 15 years
experience in this field.
''According to projections, the marine industry expects a 5%
year-on-year growth in Europe in shipbuilding, and when I am in
Amsterdam I hope to make contact with a lot of people in the industry,''
he said.
Until now, John has been using the Alexandria New Enterprise Workshop,
run by Strathclyde Business Development to develop prototypes.
''Much of the work involves computers using a system called Tadcam,
and I have incorporated this so that I am using the most advance
techniques available,'' he explained.
Scientific Model Propellers (Scotland) will be contacting all the
experimental tanks companies in Europe, and John hopes to meet many of
them at the Europort Exhibition.

As companies seek to expand after the recession Harry Conroy looks at
four firms on the up.
THE engineering industry has come through tough times in the last few
years, and while Andrew Waugh admits that life has not been easy he is
looking forward to better days.
Mr Waugh took over the family business of A K Waugh in 1988 when his
father died, and was immediately faced with the massive downturn in the
engineering industry.
Pre-slump A K Waugh, which manufactures process heating equipment,
employed a staff of 30, compared to today's staff of nine, but Mr Waugh
believes that the company can start to grow again.
''We never had an overdraft, but this has limited the investment we
could make in the company,'' he explained.
Proof of his confidence is demonstrated by his purchase last week of
Monitor Acoustic Controls, which was in administrative receivership, and
in Mr Waugh's own words was ''teetering on the edge'' when he purchased
it.
The two companies have had a strange on-off relationship. ''My
grandfather helped to start Monitor Acoustic Control,'' said Mr Waugh.
A K Waugh then bought the company when it went bust, and having sorted
out its problems, sold it, only to buy it for a second time last week
when it was again in difficulties. ''I am confident that we can turn the
company around,'' he Waugh.
Monitor Acoustics, based in South Street, Glasgow, manufactures
equipment such as air ducts, and noise reduction enclosures.
''We are confident that we can more than double the Monitor turnover
to #1m in a short time,'' said Mr Waugh.
He plans to increase the workforce at Monitor Acoustics from 11 to 15.
A K Waugh supplies heat processing equipment to most of Britain's
power stations as well as dealing with companies in the United States,
Canada, Hong Kong, and Australia.
In June, A K Waugh moved to a larger factory on the edge of Drumchapel
and recently completed a contract for a sugar company in Uganda.
The purchase of Monitor Acoustics, Mr Waugh believes, will give both
companies an opportunity to expand, and their combined turnover will
allow him to invest more in the business.
He praised Drumpchapel Opportunities for the advice and help they have
given him since he moved into the area.
He added: ''We were lucky to survive the recession, but we can look
forward to growth.''
To relax, Waugh goes to Le Mans and although he missed the event this
year because of the move to Drumchapel, he had been to the eight
previous races.
Through his interest in cars he has struck up a friendship with Mr
Fred Goodwin, deputy chief executive of the Clydesdale Bank, and recalls
spending an evening in a garage swopping engines between cars.
His next purchase is unlikely to be another company, but an old Jaguar
to rebuild.

TRAVELLING with young children can be stressful, but mother-of-two
Collette Connell decided to do something about it -- she launched Fun
House, a short-term creche at Glasgow airport.
The idea came to Collette last summer after flying to America with her
two children, Christopher, five, and Elliot, three. ''We had to check in
three hours before departure. It was dreadful. I was shattered before I
got on the flight.''
She raised the idea with Ken Smith who designed the Fun House
children's television show on Scottish Television and Chris Barclay,
managing director of Miracle UK, who markets children's play equipment.
Both expressed an interest, and the three formed Fun House.
''We approached the airport, which had already seen the need to
provide a facility for travellers with young children and were
considering what to do,'' explained Collette.
Fun House opened at the airport this June, and was an instant success.
At the start of Glasgow's annual fair holidays the facility was open
from 6am through until three o'clock the next morning, and was used by
350 youngsters between the ages of three and ten.
''Most children join us for 30 minutes as the activities are quite
physical and they get tired, but they often come back for more,'' she
said.
During the quieter winter months, Fun House will cater for children's
parties in conjunction with McDonald's who have premises in the airport.
School parties on educational visits to the airport also join in the
fun.
Fun House is looking for other sites, and have two under
consideration.
When she dreamt up the short-term creche idea, Collette was taking a
break from her civil service job as an executive officer in the MoD's
regimental pay office to study part-time for a law degree.
She is still studying at Strathclyde University, but no longer sees
herself returning to the civil service. ''I believe the company can
expand,'' she says, ''and this is more fun than paying soldiers'
wages.''

KINGFISHER, the retailing group, will today announce that Sir John
Banham, former director-general of the Confederation of British
Industry, is to become its chairman, in succession to Sir Nigel Mobbs.
He is expected to become a non-executive director before assuming the
chairmanship early in 1996.
The news will please the City of London which wants a heavyweight
figure to act as a counter to Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy.
The latter was the architect of Kingfisher's revival in the 1980s,
when he grafted leading specialist multiples like Comet, B &amp; Q, and
Superdrug onto the original Woolworths chain, and he also saw the group
through the recession.
Lately however the group has lost its way and its operations are
under-performing against strong competitors like the retailing arms of
the regional electricity distributors and Dixons in respect of Comet and
Sainsbury's Homebase in DIY retailing.
The group went through a boardroom shake-up early this year which saw
Sir Geoffrey strengthen his grip.
Mr Alan Smith, a retail expert who had been a Marks &amp; Spencer
director, stepped down as chief executive, and the finance director and
two other board members left.
Sir Geoffrey moved from chairman to chief executive and Sir Nigel came
in as a stopgap chairman. He will leave to concentrate on his main
interest, Slough Estates.
Sir John is a management consultant from the McKinsey stable and he is
bound to develop firm ideas of how Kingfisher should improve its trading
performance, possibly leading to clashes with Sir Geoffrey who is keen
for the retailing chains to try and trade their way out of difficulties
rather than sell the worst performers such as Comet.
Kingfisher's systems and trading formats are not considered as
up-to-date as they could be and Sir John is likely to be keen on
strengthening management controls to improve response times to changing
consumer demands.
He is chairman of Tarmac and a non-executive director of National
Westminster Bank but has little direct experience of retailing.

expected soon and the shares are recommended. Silvermines could benefit
from the proposal to install more TV cameras in towns and cities. Buy
plant-hire group Ashtead and hold Cadbury Schweppes and Tarmac.
SUNDAY EXPRESS
BANK of Scotland looks an ideal takeover target, with a strong balance
sheet and the scope to cut costs enormously. Buy the shares, along with
HTV, which is also likely to attract a bidder. British Steel is also
rated a buy thanks to its prospective high yield.

RESTAURANT group Pelican will open its 50th Cafe Rouge this week and
recent openings have been trading well. The shares are not expensive
despite takeover talk. Symonds Engineering is worth a buying after its
proposal to buy Finishing Services. Hold Royal Bank of Scotland amid
takeover speculation.
INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY
THERE is little to suggest Bank of Scotland has much to offer
shareholders, either as a possible bid target, or in terms of long-term
growth. The advice is to sell. There is good scope for further expansion
at Havelock Europa, which reports half-year figures on Wednesday.
Property group PSIT looks expensive, according to broker UBS, but
electronics supplier Telemetrix is worth a gamble.

BRITISH Gas chief executive Cedric Brown has turned down a new bonus
scheme that could have earned him #2.4m over the next four years, it was
reported yesterday.
However, his fellow executive directors could receive up to #1.5m each
under the proposals, if their company performs well compared other
leading stock market groups.
British Gas refused to confirm or deny newspaper reports that a
statement on the incentive scheme would be made today.
If an announcement was made, said a spokeswoman, it would come through
the normal Stock Exchange information channels.
Mr Brown has been the focus of the criticism over so-called fat cat
bosses of privatised utilitiy comanies since it was disclosed he had
accepted a 75% pay rise to #475,000 last year.
He was condemned by unions, consumer groups, politicians and
shareholders, who gave him a rough ride at the company's rowdy five-hour
annual meeting in May.
The big pay rise coincided with large-scale job cuts by the group,
showroom closures and soaring customer complaints.
British Gas said the increase had been agreed to compensate Mr Brown
for giving up a former bonus and share option scheme.
He was recalled by the Commons Trade and Industry Select Committee for
a further grilling by MPs when details of the new bonus payments first
became public.
Some 300 senior executives are expected to be offered shares worth up
to 125% of their annual basic pay for each of the next four years, if
the company meets tough performance criteria relative to other major
public companies.
It is suggested Mr Brown has waived his right to the payments because
he does not intend to stay on until the normal retirement age of 65 in
five years' time, when the bonus shares would be available to be cashed
in.

GEC.
It is understood that he is in the running for the post, one of the
most prestigious in British industry. The succession is likely to figure
in tomorrow's board meeting of GEC, amid impatience in the City of
London for the question to be resolved.
However, GEC chairman Lord Prior has indicated that the successor will
not be named until early spring.
A short-list of candidates, including several other illustrious names
in industry, has been drawn up and there is also at least one internal
candidate. But Mr Simpson is believed to have several key points in his
favour.
An accountant with lengthy operational experience, he has knowledge of
the defence sector following his tenure at British Aerospace (BAe) where
he was deputy chief executive from 1992 to 1994, during which time the
abortive merger talks between BAe and GEC took place.
He is well regarded in the City and Lucas shares shot up when he was
named as its chief executive.
GEC's image does not rank highly. There has been criticism over its
perceived lack of strategic focus and concentration on defence and the
heavy end of the electrical industry, at the expense of growth areas
like mobile telecommunications.
Institutional shareholders would prefer an outside appointment as this
would be more likely to result in a change in the current culture.
Lord Weinstock, sometimes dubbed Britain's leading industrialist, has
been running GEC for 33 years and intends to step down within a year
when he will be 72.
Mr Simpson, 53, joined Lucas just 18 months ago and was considered
quite a catch. He is in the process of focusing the group on its key
areas of international expertise, automotive components, particularly
brake and fuel systems. Taking over the reins at GEC would be a
challenge he would relish, though GEC would have to compensate Lucas.
There has been speculation that Lord Weinstock's son Simon, now GEC
commercial director, was being groomed for the succession, but this has
been ruled out by the group.
GEC chairman Lord Prior, 68, is not intending to bow out with Lord
Weinstock as he will act as a bridge between the old and new regimes.
GEC's last board appointment brought some unwelcome publicity for the
group. Mr Richard Needham, a former Trade Minister, was made a
non-executive director with the intention he would become head of
exports.
The news caused controversy as it came shortly before the Government
was due to announce tougher rules on Ministers moving to industry.

TIES between the schools and business remain strong, according to an
analysis of company directors published yesterday. Eton is still by far
the largest single source of directors for stock market companies,
supplying 216 of the 17,877 listed in the latest Price Waterhouse
Corporate Register.
Rugby is a long way back in second place with 92 old boys, followed by
Winchester (80) and Harrow (77). Only one non-public school, Aberdeen

THE tension is going out of this division at both ends. With
Kilmarnock and Glasgow Southern winning again and both Edinburgh
Wanderers and Wigtownshire losing, there seems little likelihood of
either pairing being disrupted.
Kilmarnock had the more difficult task at home to Gordonians who have
had some good results. As it turned out, Killie's winning 19-15
scoreline looks closer thanks to the Aberdonians' second try which came
five minutes into second half stoppage time.
The home pack dominated the opening half, but Kilmarnock had
difficulty in scoring. Eventually, Phil Gordon kicked a penalty, soon to
be equalised by Bruce Doney.
Two more Gordon successes gave Kilmarnock a 9-3 interval lead, but
when he missed a brace in the opening five minutes of the second period,
Killie turned to Robbie Stewart to put them 12-3 ahead.
When Gordonians managed to produce some sustained pressure, Kilmarnock
at last shook themselves and a try followed for Robin Carswell with
Stewart converting.
But Gordonians had the last word, an excellent try from left wing Mark
Estachy, converted by Doney, preceding Peter Blake's late effort.
Southern returned with a 39-6 success from Haddington, where fitness
told in the end. Southern scored five tries with two men downing a
brace. Gavin Walsh twice got over from short range with typically
driving charges from the back of mauls.
Sandy McDougall on one occasion, turned up on his wrong wing, on the
other, he roared in from half-way. The other try came when possession
was switched from a forward drive for centre Andrew Richardson's mazy
run. James Dunlop kicked four conversions and also put over a penalty
and a drop goal.
Craig Foster the Ayr stand-off, succeeded with all seven conversions
against aWigtownshire defence which is the worst in the premiership.
Tries from Richard Good, David McVey and Graham Paton gave Ayr a 21-3
half-time lead. In the second period, Good again, Kenny Nicol, Stewart
Magorian and Foster himself continued the points spree with a pair of
Foster penalties completing Ayr's 55-3 win.
Despite an exciting early try by full-back Ray Elliot, Langholm failed
to spark, but still won 16-6 at home to Edinburgh Wanderers. With two
Mark Grieve penalties and two for Wanderers from Steve Carnochan, they
led 11-6 at the turn. A try from David Johnstone in second-half injury
time put a better gloss on the Borderers' performance.

Oh beautiful road bridge o'er the sea to Skye!
With your fine tall concrete pillars, so handsome to the eye
I boldly deny that you look at all incongruous
For you could easily be missed by a blind man running after a bus.
To many of the folks of Skye, alas, your presence is hateful
For the Devil loves nothing better than making the Queen's subjects
ungrateful
But to soften the hearts of the Skyemen is the purpose of my humble
rhyme
And though they don't like it just now, they'll come round to it in
time.
For the tolls that are charged to cross you are really entirely
sensible
And to charge foot passengers for walking across, I ween, is quite
defensible
For Skye is such a beautiful place, by the Kyleakin green
That persons wishing to leave it at all are rarely to be seen.
And in eighteen or nineteen years they say the tolls will no longer be
seen
Though carping critics say that you should tell that to the Marines.
And when the bonnie boat of MacBrayne plies no longer across the Kyle
Think only that fog can no longer sever dear Scotia from its loveliest
isle!
The Storm Fiend is put to flight and in Hades no longer makes merry
For as all who have seen the Tay Bridge know, a bridge is safer than a
ferry.
So, beautiful bridge to Skye! I shall now conclude my lay
By urging the folk of the island to enjoy you without any delay
Let sober joy be unconfined and the bells of old Caledonia chime
For it is clear that you are the finest sea bridge of your size in
Scotland at the present time!
KENNETH WRIGHT (with apologies).

St Mirren 3, Dumbarton 2
ST MIRREN'S youngsters came of age asthey answered the call following
a traumatic week for the Paisley club. But manager Jimmy Bone could not
have expected the reaction from the supporters at the end.
Saints had hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons because of the
Barry Lavety affair. But after this 90 minutes, the fans in the stand
stood to applaud his young side from the pitch.
Said Bone: ''That was a superb display from everyone out on that
pitch. I am proud of the way they worked to lift the club.
''I have said all along that the future of this club is in our young
lads, and they just need time to come through.
''I reckon that the scoreline flatters Dumbarton and this result was
achieved because the attitude of each and every one of the players was
correct.
''It could be argued that I had a better side sitting in the stand,
but I am proud of the youngsters who came in.''
Yet Saints had to lift themselves after the shock of losing the
opening goal when, in just 12 minutes, keeper Alan Combe pulled down
Charlie Gibson, and Martin Mooney scored from the spot.
Just a couple of minutes later James Dick kick-started the Saints with
the equaliser and then, in 23 minutes, Gary McGrotty showed the pace
that was to worry the Sons defence throughout, when he got behind them
for a cut back which another of those youngsters, Paul Archdeacon,
headed in.
Even when Dumbarton edged back into the game with a surprise equaliser
early in the second half, the young Saints were not put off their
stride, and recent signing, striker Mark Yardley, got the winner in 65
minutes when he headed home a Stephen Watson cross.
But that defeat left Sons' manager Jim Fallon with a lot to think
about, particularly as they were coming off that win a week ago against
dundee United. The Boghead side never looked as if they were going to be
good enough to build on that.

A bonnie princeand a bonnieboat: In mostpeople's minds Skye will
remaina magical island for as long asthat song is sungand that storyis
recounted --accurately or not
TO many of the tourists who will use the bridge to cross to Skye, the
island's name is inextricably linked with Bonnie Prince Charlie --
despite the facts that the main clans on Skye did not rise for him and
that he spent less than a week on the island, compared to two months in
the Outer Isles, mostly in the Uists.
This association of Charles with Skye has been based largely on the
Skye Boat Song written by Sir Harold Boulton in 1884, which immortalised
Flora MacDonald's adventure with the Prince and made it one of the
best-known boat trips of all time.
In the last few years, Boulton's lyrics, in particular the recurring
''Over the Sea to Skye'', have been much used by headline writers, and
those opposed to the bridge for romantic reasons.
There appears to be - and it is not Boulton's fault - an unshakeable
belief that Charlie's Bonnie Boat sped across to Skye somewhere near
where the bridge stands today. The harsh historical truth, however,
which all Scotland has been told at some point but seems quite incapable
of retaining, is that Charles Edward Stuart never saw the Kyle of
Lochalsh.
His historic escape, dressed in women's clothes, was from another
island, Benbecula, over considerably more sea to the north-west coast of
Skye.
On a day when Skye has again grabbed the world's attention with a very
different crossing, it is worth pondering what really happened 249 years
ago.
A week after his defeat at Culloden, the Prince had crossed over the
Minch in an eight-oar boat bound for the island of Eriskay where he had
landed nine months earlier. He was blown off course and landed on
Benbecula.
Here he was to begin two long months of wandering in the Outer Isles,
keeping just ahead of the Hanoverian troops, mostly in the Uists but
reaching north to Scalpay and Lewis, almost into Stornoway itself, only
to be barred by a posse of about 200.
Nobody in Stornoway would get him a boat to Orkney or to the mainland,
so it was back south to Jacobite lands of Clanranald in Benbecula and
South Uist. There he was being pursued by various Hanoverian forces
including some of the MacDonald Militia from Skye.
The Skye MacDonalds, the MacDonalds of Sleat, were fundamentally
Jacobite as were the Macleods of Dunvegan, but both were officially on
the Hanoverian side during the '45. This was thought to be the result of
blackmail by the then Lord President of the Court of Session, Forbes of
Culloden.
He would not prosecute the chiefs for their role in
Saothach-nan-Daoine (the Ship of the People), which in 1739 had taken
ordinary people from from their lands to be sold into slavery as bonded
servants in the Americas. The price was public support for the Crown.
In fact, it was one of the Skye MacDonalds pursuing the Young
Pretender who, according to Alistair Maclean and John S Gibson in their
Summer Hunting a Prince: the Escape of Charles Edward Stuart, was the
architect of his escape.
''It was to the Prince in the cave behind Beinn Ruigh Choinnich (in
South Uist) that a messenger now brought a surprising proposal from none
other than Hugh MacDonald of Armadale, who commanded the MacDonald
Militia company, ostensibly hunting for him in South Uist. This was to
the effect that the Prince should be disguised as a woman and ferried
over the Skye as maid servant to Flora MacDonald, a young gentlewoman of
the Milton family of South Uist who was also Armadale's step-daughter.''
Armadale even went as far as to send a letter to his wife on Skye to
lend credence to the whole project: ''I have sent your daughter from
this country lest she should be anyway frightened with the troops lying
here. She has got one Betty Burke, an Irish girl who, as she tells me,
is a good spinster. If her spinning pleases you may keep her till she
spin all your lint; or if you have any wool you may employ her . . .''
It was at 8pm on the evening of June 28, 1746, that the Prince and
Flora MacDonald with Neil MacEachan, an important Jacobite agent; John
and Rory MacDonald, of Glenalladale, and another Rory MacDonald, brother
of MacDonald of Gearraidh Fliuch (all three Jacobite officers); John
MacMhuirich from Bornish; and Duncan MacIomhair from Roshnish, set off
for Skye and sailed into the island's history.
They left from the south side of Loch Uisgebhagh on Benbecula's east
coast. There was not a Royal Navy vessel within sight. The RN's
considerable presence in the Minch had been deceived into thinking that
the Prince could be making good his escape on board an Irish meal ship,
the David, which had been lying off Uist.
Their boat was spotted by sentries of the Skye Militia as they rounded
Waternish Point, but the militia men made little attempt to intercept
them, despite having boats on the shore for that purpose, suggesting
they may well have been in the know. At very least it is clear that the
MacDonalds and Macleods who were officially searching for the Prince had
very little enthusiasm for their task.
His first port of call was at MacDonald of Kingsburgh, whose son Allan
was subsequently to marry Flora MacDonald and head to North America in
time to fight for the British Crown in the American War of Independence.
When he went to Portree the Prince felt relaxed enough to sit in a
public room of a local hostelry, McNab's Inn, and indulge himself.
Then it was over to Raasay for a brief visit. MacLeod of Raasay had
been in the Prince's army, but he was in hiding in Knoydart.
On crossing back to Skye, Charles made for the MacKinnon country at
Elgol. The MacKinnons had risen for him and again did him great service,
providing a boat to take him over to the mainland on the south side of
Loch Nevis.
Charles Edward Stuart didn't return to Skye, but his name has never
left, thanks to Sir Harold Boulton. Boulton himself ended up buying the
island of Inch Kenneth (which was subsequently to be owned by the
Mitford family) off the west coast of Mull, where he seems to have spent
his time collecting Jacobite songs and penning a few himself.
In 1933 he published Prince Charlie in Song, a musical chronology of
the Prince's time in Scotland from his arrival in Eriskay to his
departure from Loch nan Uamh.
Four years earlier he had produced another musical gem, Fionnphort
Ferry. There are, as yet, no plans to replace that service with a bridge
to Iona.

ROB ROBERTSON recalls the halcyon
days of the Usher family and witnesses
the turn of fortune's wheel
THE final chapter in the fall of the House of Usher will be played out
in the Borders next week.
The Edinburgh-based brewing and whisky institution, Andrew Usher and
Company, was once one of Edinburgh's leading families and patrons of the
arts and commerce.
Its strong connections with the capital and the beloved Borders
stretch back almost 100 years.
For 94 years, the family home was the stately Hallrule House in the
Borders. However, next week, the extraordinary lives of the Ushers will
come under the spotlight when the contents of Hallrule go under the
hammer at Christie's in Edinburgh.
Family members have, through the generations, gifted the Usher Hall to
Edinburgh, held a close friendship with Sir Walter Scott, owned what is
now Richard Branson's Norton House Hotel, given massive donations to
hospitals, and made a fortune through their beer and whisky-making
companies.
In the 1880s, Usher products took Britain by storm. Their whisky sold
by the crateload south of the border, knocking brandy off its perch as
the fashionable drink of the English. Usher's beer was another
well-known best seller throughout Britain.
The family's fortune was built on the successful beer and whisky
companies based in Edinburgh. They were so successful that their
warehouses at St Leonard's in the capital could hold twenty five million
bottles of whisky.
The distillery was sold by the family to Scottish Malt Distillers in
1918 for what was an ''undisclosed big amount of money''.
Now Hallrule House, set in secluded parkland overlooking Rule Water
near Jedburgh, is to be sold and the entire contents auctioned off.
The move is necessary to pay two sets of death duties faced by the
family over the past four years with the death of the two present heirs.
Neither married or had sons.
The family link with Hallrule started with Sir Robert Usher, the
second baronet.
Robert was the son of the first baronet, Sir John, and nephew of Sir
Andrew Usher, whose gift of #100,000 to the city of Edinburgh in 1896
was spent building the world famous Usher Hall in the heart of the city.
Hallrule House itself has a history as turbulent as the Borders. In
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the house and the Wells estate,
of which it was part, had been passed from one feuding Borders family to
another -- the Turnbulls, Rutherfords, Stewarts of Traquair, and the
Elliots of Stobs all owning it at different times.
Following Elliot family debts and the letting of the Wells estate,
Hallrule passed into the hands of Sir Robert. He was a very successful
businessman and well-known Scottish philanthropist who lived from 1860
to 1933.
A glimpse at his will and testament in the main room at Hallrule makes
fascinating reading. It shows that he donated vast sums of money to
local charities and hospitals.
His donations included #2500 to the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh,
#1000 to the Sick Children's Hospital, #10,000 to Edinburgh University,
and #2500 to Simpson's Memorial Hospital.
The house passed to his son, Sir John Turnbull Usher, then to Sir
John's brother, Stuart. In turn, it was left to Sir Stuart's two sons,
first Sir Peter, who died in 1990, then Robert, who died in September of
last year.
The title of Baronet Usher now goes to a relation in South Africa who
is the eldest son of the fifth son of Sir Robert Usher, the fourth
Baronet.
Driving up the secluded drive of Hallrule House, the mind wanders back
to days of affluence and style. A privately-printed book, The Usher
Family in Scotland, conjures up images of the lifestyle they must have
enjoyed in their mansion before the wars.
It offers images of a bustling house full of children, with nannies,
servants, and a chauffeur on the staff.
The book, published anonymously in 1956, also remembers sporting
exploits of the family in what the book describes as ''feather, fin,
fur, and games''.
It chronicles the family links with the historic Bruntsfield Links
Golf Association, the Linlithgow and Stirlingshire Hunt, horse-racing at
Kelso, and with the Waverley Curling Club.
It also states: ''In the world of sport, surely few families have
produced more Masters of Foxhounds over the period.''
When Jackie Wolfe-Murray looks over the rambling mansion house and its
walled garden she remembers her childhood days. She particularly
remembers her father, Sir John, the sense of fun in the house, and the
hunting, shooting, and fishing parties.
She also surveys with fond memories the items about to leave the
family forever. Many are already numbered for the journey to the auction
room.
As she walks around the house she remembers objects from the past.
Downstairs is an oil painting by William McTaggart, entitled Crossing
The Bar, which is being put up for auction at between #15,000 and
#20,000.
In the hall is a walnut and floral marquetry longcase clock which has
been marked at between #2500 and #3500.
Two hundred and ninety-six lots will go under the hammer, including
furniture, porcelain, oriental works of art, books, pictures, and silver
with estimates from #40 to #40,000.
Among the diverse items are a large eighteenth-century silver
baluster-shaped coffee pot on sale for between #1800 and #2500; a plum
pudding mahogany desk between #1200 and #1800; and a late
nineteenth-century game pannier for bringing grouse off the hill which
is on sale for between #80 and #120.
Sitting in the living room of Hallrule, Jackie does not express any
regret of what might have been if the house had remained in her side of
the family.
In fact, some may argue that the fall of the House of Usher may never
have happened if it hadn't been for the conventionality, some might say
downright sexism, of the British aristocracy.
The situation began with her father Sir John Usher, the third baronet,
a veteran of two world wars, who was awarded an OBE for his service in
the Royal Pioneeer Corps in World War Two.
He was also a regular soldier who served in the Royal Scots Greys, the
Inniskilling Dragoons, and the 9th Lancers.
In a book titled Battle of Britain he is referred to as ''an eccentric
nobleman who always carried a shepherd's crook and wore a monocle. He
was a well-known figure in the toughest part of east London where
evidently he never had any trouble and the inhabitants did what he told
them.''
He married Lady Jean, who died in 1950, and had two daughters, the
eldest Katherine, and Jackie, the current executor of the estate, who
married Captain Michael Wolfe-Murray of the Gordon Highlanders.
Because of convention, it was boys rather than girls who were deemed
to inherit. That meant instead of either Katherine or Jackie being given
the title and house when their father died, aged 59 in 1951, it fell
instead to his brother, Sir Stuart Usher.
Like Sir John, Sir Stuart was a keen horseman and attended the Royal
Military College at Sandhurst. He was a member of the Jedforest Foxhunt
and during one outing pulled a fellow rider out of the River Teviot for
which he later received the bronze medal of the Royal Humane Society.
He moved to Hallrule and lived there until his death in 1962. He was
succeeded by his son, Sir Peter who died, aged 60, in 1990. The title
then went to his other son, Sir Robert, who died in September of last
year.
Looking round the contents of the house which are expected to raise
tens of thousands of pounds at auction on Tuesday, October 24, Jackie
said she had no real regrets about the house and the contents being put
up for sale.
''I know the people who are buying the house and know they will look
after it,'' she said. ''It hasn't changed much in the last 50 years and
obviously they'll need to renovate it a bit.''
As executor of the estate, she has stayed in Hallrule for the last 10
months, returning occasionally to her nearby home.
''During the last few months, I have been reacquainting myself with
the house all over again,'' she said.
''It's been great being back and I've loved every minute of it. It
brings back memories of my parents and my father. He was a keen shot,
liked reading, and was proud to be Master of the Jedforest Foxhounds.
''To be honest, at that time I didn't see much of him because there
were so many staff in the house which was quite common at the time
looking after me sister and me.''
Looking at a picture by Sam Bough, entitled Moonlight on the Avon,
Jackie said: ''This painting and other things that will be sold were in
the house when I was growing up. They will always have a special place
for me.
''They are all part and parcel of the past.''

When Johnson and Boswell left Glenelg on
a September morning in 1773 to sail to
Armadale Castle . . . Glenelg-Kylerhea
was the main ferry route to and from
Skye, and had been for many a century
ALTHOUGH all the attention today will focus on the Kyle of Lochalsh,
where the new bridge will replace the ferry which has been Skye's main
communication route since the coming of the railway 98 years ago, this
was not the island's main ferry before then. That lay further south,
between Glenelg on the mainland and Kylerhea on Skye.
It was the ferryman at Kylerhea who advised Samuel Johnson that a mile
on land was two miles at sea, which did little for the regard that great
English man of letters held of Gaelic wit.
But when you see the tide rushing through the narrows where Skye comes
closest to touching the mainland, you begin to wonder whether there
might have been something in the ferrymen's calculations. After all,
these were the waters that consumed the Fingalian hero Reatha, only to
take his name as their own for ever.
What exactly was happening in the third century AD, when Reatha had to
try and vault the kyle using his spear, is not totally clear, but when
Johnson and Boswell left Glenelg that September morning in 1773 to sail
all the way to Armadale Castle, Glenelg-Kylerhea was the main ferry
route to and from Skye, and had been for many a century.
It was here that the drovers would take cattle from all over Skye and
the Uists to cross from Kylerhea to Glenelg on their way to the markets
of Crieff or Falkirk.
Anything up to 8000 cattle a year would be swum across the kyle in one
year, but because of the tides, which often flow at seven eight, nine
knots, time was limited, as Alexander Nicolson recalled in his History
of Skye, republished last summer by Maclean Press:
''Across these straits the animals were made to swim and, as soon as
'slack' water supervened, the work of ferrying began. The animals were
bound together in files of five, the tail of the one in front being tied
by a rope of heather, or of straw, to the muzzle of the one behind, and
the first of the line was fastened to the stern of a boat that was rowed
across the sound with its trail behind it.
''By this means, as many as 100 animals could be transferred to the
mainland in the course of a single day.'' The same was done with horses.
The ferry fell into disuse from time to time, but it was started again
in 1935 by a Kylerhea man, Lachie MacInnes, who had a ferry built that
was capable of taking two cars. The service was discontinued with the
outbreak of war in 1939, and with petrol rationing continuing after the
war the ferry was never really re-established, although Lord MacDonald,
who had the ferry rights, tried.
It was in the late Fifties that Murdo MacKenzie and his father decided
to have another go. Although born in Inverary, Murdo had many
connections with Glenelg. ''My grandfather had been the first doctor
there, and my mother the first district nurse. My father, meanwhile, had
come from Arnisdale just down on the northern shore of Loch Hourn.
''The first thing we needed was a boat, and I knew that Lachie
MacInnes's boat had been sunk over in Loch Nevis. So I went down there
and managed to get her up, and even managed to get the engine running -
an old petrol paraffin one - but I finally had to put a diesel in her.
So that's how we got started.
''Things were pretty quiet. I think on the first day we got three
cars, and it took us till the middle of the summer before we got into
double figures. You see, there were hardly any roads; they weren't
tarred. I think there was only three cars in total in Glenelg and we
owned one of them, so that wasn't much good.
''Slowly, the tourist trade built up. I remember when we got our first
#5 in the day. My father and I went to the pub and we drank it. That was
a big day.''
Murdo ran the ferry for 33 years, during which time his name became
almost synonymous with the Glenelg/Kylrhea crossing. He had five boats
in all, ending up with the last of the Ballachulish ferries --
''everything had become so civilised by then''.
When he decided to retire, it proved difficult to find a successor who
had both the seamanship equal to the worst currents on the west coast,
and the social skills to integrate with the local community.
''Being a ferryman, you have to know the people - it's more than
working a boat. It would have been difficult for a stranger. One man
from down south wanted it as a plaything for his son. In these waters?
''Having built it up, I would have felt terrible if it had collapsed.
I had to get the right man, even if it meant taking a Raasay man,''
Murdo says affectionately of his successor.
The Raasay man in question was Roddy Macleod, who had sailed deep sea
for 11 years before coming back to work for the MoD in Kyle of Lochalsh.
Six years ago, he took over the ferry and has no regrets.
''It has gone very well, but I had to relearn my seamanship. It is
completely different with these currents. With a very strong spring
tide, we will have the current running at nine knots, and I understand
that it was once recorded at 13 knots.
''I was telling an ex-boss of mine who had been a pilot in the Fleet
Air Arm, that it was the sort of job that would have suited him because
it is all the world like landing a plane on an aircraft carrier with a
strong side wind.''
Roddy Macleod has been happy with his numbers, but such was Murdo's
association with the ferry in the public mind, that tourists, having
heard of his retiral, in the first few seasons would sometimes come down
and tell Roddy that the ferry no longer operated.
He is sanguine about the future, Skye bridge notwithstanding.
''Everyone goes on about the bridge opening, and how it is going to
affect me. They have got that the wrong way round. Can the bridge
withstand the opposition from Glenelg? I think the reason they were late
in opening was that they were hoping I would be out of business.
''As it is they will only have to face competion for a week, as I will
close for the winter on the Saturday after the bridge opens, but I will
be open again on the Monday before Easter.
''Seriously . . . I am confident. Some people have always made the
effort to come round this way. We have managed to get a big enough share
of the market to give us a living. The bridge having a high toll I
believe will mean I will increase my trade.
''Even if it was a free bridge, I still think I would have people
wanting to cross the sea to Skye on the shortest of crossings. They
don't have to pay much: #5 single, #9 return, and a six-day ticket for
#18 - and we are subsidised by nobody.''
Travellers would be well advised to try this route to Skye. Turning
off at Shiel Bridge and driving up through Ratagan and down into Glenelg
gives some of the finest views in the Highlands, almost Alpine. Glenelg
itself was among the earliest lands to come under the progenitor of the
Clan Macleod. This was Leod himself, born about 1200, the son of Olave
The Black and Christina, daughter of Farquhar, Earl of Ross, who was to
give him Glenelg.
A bit over 500 years later, a military road was built into Glenelg to
serve Bernera barracks and the garrison. The government had thought this
necessary in the wake of the 1715 Jacobite Rising. These are now
regarded as the finest of four built in the 18th century Highlands as
anti-Jacobite measures.

Will there be ferry competition? It's still
unclear, and while it seemed natural to
many that the bridge would render the boat
redundant, the service (or future lack of it)
has remained a passion-generating issue
EVEN as we go to press with this special Skye Bridge supplement it
remains unclear whether there will be a car ferry providing direct
competition to the bridge across the Kyle of Lochalsh in the long term.
To most it seemed natural that the bridge would render the ferry
redundant, but the controversy which has surrounded the bridge's
privately-financed development, and the high toll regime, have meant
that the ferry service has remained a passion-generating issue.
Plans have been afoot for several years now to provide a small
car-ferry service as an alternative for tourists and to serve the
communities of Kyle of Lochalsh and, more particularly, Kyleakin. Local
campaigners and other interested parties formed the Skye Boat Company
with the intention of acquiring a ferry. Negotiations have begun with
Highland Regional Council over the lease of the two slipways (the
Scottish Office will hand over its ownership of the mainland slip once
the bridge opens).
The Skye Boat Company, however, was not the first to think of running
a car ferry service to compete with the bridge. The publicly-owned
Caledonian MacBrayne, which currently operates the service, had plans to
carry on the service in a more modest form. This did not go down well in
St Andrews House.
In October 1989, the Scottish Office issued an invitation to tender
for the bridge project which would be paid for by inflation-linked tolls
for a 16- to 27-year period, depending on business. The invitation made
clear that tenders should be based on the assumption that the existing
ferry service would cease. Calculations were therefore made on the basis
that there would be no competition. The bridge would have an effective
monopoly.
By the following month moe than 50 applications had been received for
a copy of the prospectus, with 12 of the applications being seen as
serious.
In January 1991, before the Scottish Office was announced it had
chosen Miller Construction ahead of Morrison and Trafalgar House from
its short leet of three, it appeared that the issue had not been settled
at all. Ross, Cromarty and Skye MP Charles Kennedy raised it with
Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas Hamilton:
''This entire project has operated against an unfortunate backdrop of
cynicism and suspicion and this will hardly help. It now appears there
has been a complete lack of understanding between the Scottish Office
and CalMac on any future ferry service once a bridge is in position.''
Mr Kennedy was reacting to news that had emerged that day that CalMac
was indeed proposing to run a service. The Herald had contacted Colin
Paterson, CalMac's managing director, who had confirmed the plan. A
phone call to the Scottish Office elicited the response: ''Oh no they're
not.''
Back to Mr Paterson: ''Well nobody has told us. We are owned by the
Secretary of State so obviously if he directs us not to provide a
service then we will have to comply. If he doesn't, we could provide a
scaled-down car-ferry service to compete with the bridge and we are sure
it would be financially viable, particularly in the summer.
''It would not be like the current service but based on a one
car-ferry which would provide a service to those tourists who want to go
'Over the Sea to Skye'. But it would also provide a passenger service
for the considerable number of people in Kyleakin who work in Kyle.
''The plans for the bridge will mean Kyle and Kyleakin are by-passed,
leaving it a long haul for the people of Kyleakin to get to work and
back.
''I am sure that we could make money on such a project and, if we
don't, somebody else will. The Secretary of State can stop us but he
can't stop another company coming in and doing it. These are common-user
slipways which can be used by others.''
Within an hour the Scottish Office had told Mr Paterson he was not to
run a service in competition to the bridge. Such was the official rush
to get this project off the ground, this was the first time he had been
told (since the project was launched over a year previously) that one of
his most profitable services would have to be withdrawn.
The Government was to recognise the financial implications of the loss
of this service to CalMac and adjust its funding accordingly. Overwise,
CalMac's ability to continue to run permanent loss-making services to
small island communities would have been seriously restricted.
However, there were some late signs that not everybody in authority
fully appreciated the position. As preparations were being made for the
inaugural sailing of the new ferry for Ullapool/Stornoway, the Isle of
Lewis, Scottish Office minister Lord James Douglas Hamilton asked why
CalMac wouldn't be continuing to run the Skye ferry once the bridge
opened. ''Because you won't let me!'' Mr Paterson replied.
There was also a great deal of official confusion to surround another
aspect of the ferry's withdrawal. Namely whether it could be completed
without the a public inquiry, or at very least extensive public
consultations. Indeed, as The Herald revealed in March, it was possible
the ferry service would have to keep running after the bridge opened to
complete public consultation on its withdrawal. The position was
complicated.
Until the passage of the 1993 Railway Act, the Scottish Transport
Users' Consultative Committee had the sole right to call public
inquiries into the withdrawal of any ferry service. The Act replaced the
STUCCC with the Railway Users' Consultative Committee for Scotland.
Despite the name-change, the RUCCS was to continue to have
responsibility for Caledonian MacBrayne ferries. Indeed, last month the
RUCCS actually met in Stornoway on the Island of Lewis.
At the RUCCS's meeting in Perth in March, however, it was reported
that the committee ''may'' have lost it power to call public inquiries
into ferry withdrawals. Acting chairman Lawrence Kemp was determined to
pursue the matter, not so much for Skye, but for other communities which
might be faced with the loss of their ferry services in the future.
At the end of March the Scottish Office declared: ''The matter is far
from straightforward and is currently being considered by the RUCCS and
the Ministry of Transport. We believe the RUCCS still has a general
power to consider any matter affecting ferry services or facilities
provided by Caledonian MacBrayne, which of course would involve the
withdrawal of a service.''
By June the official position had changed: ''Both the Scottish Office
and the Ministry of Transport have advised the RUCCS that we believe it
does not have a statutory right to call a public inquiry. We do not know
if they accept that or not; there has been no comeback.'' Mr Kemp told
The Herald he didn't accept this and had written back for further
clarification.
The following month Transport Minister John Watts took the
extraordinary step of telling the RUCCS to hire a lawyer to advise them
on this matter. As far as the Government was concerned they didn't have
the right and the STUCC hadn't had it either, although it had exercised
it without challenge for decades. Mr Watts did not appear entirely
confident about the exact legal position and told the RUCCS: ''You will
appreciate that this represents the Department's view and is not offered
as an authoritative interpretation of the law. It is for the committee
to obtain such legal advice as it considers necessary in order that may
be fully informed.''
Charles Kennedy, meanwhile, called on the RUCCS to take the matter to
the Court of Session to protect its position in the future. By last
month, however, the official position had changed yet again.
At its Stornoway meeting RUCCS secretary Bill Ure announced that the
Scottish Office had cleared up the situation -- ''I am pleased to say
that this doubt has been resolved. The committee's powers are given by
Section 56 of the 1962 Transport Act. In plain language, that means the
committee has the power to look into any matter which it feels it should
look into, or on which it receives representations. So it is quite clear
that as far as the Kyle/Kyleakin service is concerned, the committee
does have powers.'' What it didn't appear to have, however, was the
power to keep the ferry running until the holding of a public inquiry.
Just before this supplement was published, it was announced the RUCCS
would hold an informal public hearing in Kyle following the ferry's
withdrawal -- not a public inquiry.
Charles Kennedy was delighted. ''I very much welcome this development.
It is important that people locally can air their anxieties directly. I
do hope that as many individuals and groups as possible will attend the
meeting.''
All of this official confusion has done to dispell the feeling in Skye
that things have militated against the local voice being heard, as
Kathleen MacRae of the Skye Bridge Appeal Group made clear.
''This meeting is just a PR exercise, what we needed was a public
inquiry,'' she said. ''This could have all been resolved a long, long
time ago. But no, it has gone back and forward, people changing their
minds, delays here and delays there.
''And then all of a sudden it is resolved -- the RUCCS does have the
power to call a public inquiry, but now the ferry is within days of
ending, so there's no time. All very convenient.''

BONN: German's Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel yesterday called for a
worldwide ban on anti-personnel landmines and said his country should
lead by example. ''These diabolical weapons are no longer needed,'' said
Mr Kinkel, but added that Germany would consult its allies before
acting.
His call came a day after a mine left over from the 1980-88 Iraq-Iran
war killed four Iranian border guards. Last week's failure by 42
governments meeting in Vienna to ban or restrict landmines, which kill
or main 20,000 people a year, provoked outrage among humanitarian
groups.

AT THREE o'clock this afternoon the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry will
leave Kyleakin and head for Kyle of Lochalsh for the last time. The 43
workers employed on the ferry will then either be made redundant or take
up other positions within the Caledonian MacBrayne network.
CalMac's personnel director, Ian Russell, told The Herald: ''We
offered them all the opportunity of a transfer to a larger vessel, and
12 have taken us up on that. By and large, they will be working on
ferries which operate a system of two weeks on and two weeks off, with
them staying on board. So they won't have to move house, although one
has decided to go to Mull.
''The remainder face redundancy and obviously there is a need for
retraining so they can pick up other skills. We are working with the
LEC, Skye and Lochalsh Enterprise, paying 50% of retraining costs.
''We have one employee who is starting up a transport business,
another in computers and one who is going to do courier work. One of the
women, an on-shore purser, is going into adventure training.
''But it has been an awful time for them, working away seeing the
bridge going up all the time. I used to work at Singer's and have been
through this before. Losing your job is a dreadful experience.''
After years of controversy about the bridge, ferrymen wanted to keep
their heads well down, but the general feeling seemed to be that CalMac
was trying its best to help them.
Whether a ferry will run in competition to the bridge remains unclear,
but the withdrawal of the CalMac service this afternoon will bring to an
end almost a century in which Skye's main ferry route was across the
Kyle of Lochalsh.
This began on November 2, 1897, with the opening of Kyle of Lochalsh
station, the line linking east and west coasts having finally been
extended from its previous terminus of Strome Ferry.
The railway between Perth and Inverness had opened in September 1863.
Seven months later, nine men with business interests in wool and fish
met in London to discuss carrying the rail on to the West Coast. The
main object was to gain access to the Minch fishery, the fruits of which
could not reach London fresh enough.
In 1865, the Dingwall and Skye Railway Act was passed with the
original intention of going all the way to the then tiny village of
Kyle, but because of difficulties they settled for Strome where a pier
was built, and the line was opened on August 19, 1870.
When it made it to Kyle 27 years later, the Lovedale, the ship that
had been running from Strome to Portree, and the Stornoway boat, the
Gael, moved round to their new mainland port.
The publicity material promoting the opening of Kyle station also
announced that a ''Steam Ferry Boat'' would ply the Kyle of Lochalsh -
but all travellers found was a rowing boat. That was probably the first
time that ferry queues began to form for the ferry. They have been a
feature of life in Kyleakin and Kyle ever since; coming and going,
depending on the weather and the size and mechanical health of the
ferries.
The problem was particularly acute in the late Sixties, when the small
turntable vessels simply could not cope, often leaving cars waiting for
four hours.
In 1969, two end-loading ferries capable of carrying 28 cars each were
ordered. The Kyleakin arrived on station in August 1970, by which time
10-hour queues were being reported, and she was joined by her sister
ship, the Lochalsh, the following year.
For most of the Seventies and early Eighties they were equal to their
tasks, but as they approached their 20th birthdays breakdowns became
more frequent, while all the time the traffic was increasing. By the end
of that decade things were reminiscent of 1969.
CalMac needed to replace the Kyleakin and Lochalsh, but needed
Scottish Office permission. This was slow in coming. It has always been
believed on Skye that it was withheld until the bridge had been given to
go ahead.
Permission did come in March 1990 to build two 36-car ferries, the
Loch Fyne and the Loch Dunvegan. Highland Regional Council, as the roads
authority, had reluctantly accepted the toll bridge idea in October
1989. They had been told by Scottish Office minister Lord James Douglas
Hamilton that it was a toll bridge or no bridge. That they would have to
wait 20 years for a free bridge.
By and large, the Lochs Dunvegan and Fyne have offered a good service.
Its extension to a 24-hour operation has left many islanders thinking
that, had this been on offer 10 years earlier, there would have been no
need for a bridge. Just two and half weeks ago there was, however, a
reminder that things can go wrong with ferries.
The Loch Dunvegan had been blown up the slipway by bad weather,
damaging her propulsion unit, and was towed south to Troon. This left
the Loch Fyne, which at 7pm on the Thursday night developed mechanical
trouble and had to be withdrawn.
CalMac decided to take the six-car Raasay ferry down to work the night
shift, but she couldn't take commercial traffic. So the Iona, which runs
between Mallaig and Armadale in the south of Skye during the summer
months, came back on duty and commercial drivers were given the choice
of going that way for the same cost, or waiting.
This all took time, and before the alternative system was put in place
CalMac had received a call from the ambulance service saying that one of
its ambulances was on the way back from taking a patient to Inverness
and needed to get back over the Skye to be on call.
The bridge company was contacted, which quickly made arrangements, and
the ambulance became the first public service vehicle to cross to the
island using the bridge.
Shortly after, the commercial sector also had to call on the good
offices of the bridge operators. A 10-tonne load of salmon from Loch
Carnan in South Uist, worth at least #20,000, was bound for Paris but
had to get over to the mainland for packing before it continued on to
France.
The lorry driver Dougie Allan knew he had problems. He said: ''When I
heard the ferry was off, I looked up to the bridge and wondered if they
would let me over. I ran up to the security hut and asked a guard there.
From then on nothing was too much trouble for the crew on the site.
''They ushered me through in no time and I was only a couple of hours
late at the packing station in Dingwall.''
He didn't even have to pay the #34 toll.

'It is regrettable that the rest of the country -- including Scotland
-- paid so little attention to what was being done until it was too
late. What an outcry there would have been if the same scheme had been
proposed for the Forth or Erskine bridges!'
THE bitterness which surrounds the opening of the Skye Bridge is not
primarily about whether or not it should have been built. That was a
matter for the judgment of people who live year-round on Skye; though it
is worth noting that they were never consulted even on that fundamental.
It is the unique and cynical way in which the finances, rather than
the bridge itself, have been constructed that have caused so much anger
and sense of betrayal. Why, in short, should the Isle of Skye be
lumbered with the highest toll regime in Europe?
Since the early 1970s there has been an enlightened programme of
bridge-building in the Highlands. Governments of both hues recognised
the need to improve communications and redress remoteness through
extensions of the road network, and the bridging of coastal waters.
Ballachulish, Kylesku, Dornoch, Cromarty, Kessock . . . the entire
programme has gone ahead on the basis of the universal approval with
substantial European funding. Only when it came to Skye did ideology
intervene.
Until the early 1990s, there had been no recent suggestion of the Skye
Bridge being financed differently when eventually it came. The greater
part of the advantage in building a bridge was to be the removal of
charges, rather than replacement of ferry fares by tolls.
The initiative for Skye to be treated differently came from the
construction industry (and Morrison Construction in particular). It was
seized on by the Tories at the peak of their zeal for privatising
everything and denying the role of public provision.
The historic disgrace is that the people of Skye were never asked (a)
if they wanted a bridge or (b) if they would rather have one now, on a
high-toll basis, or wait until public expenditure allowed it to be built
as another extension of the un-tolled road network.
We now know that they would not have had to wait very long. It is
inconceivable that a Skye Bridge -- and maybe even one of aesthetic
merit -- would not have been top of the list for Objective One funding.
Instead, by the time Objective One funding for the Highlands and
Islands was secured from Brussels, the conspiracy between the Scottish
Office and the private sector was tied up. On that basis, the Skye
Bridge was excluded from such assistance.
It is a shocking story of ideologues using a remote place for an
experiment which they could not have got away with anywhere else. The
Goverment's almost complete failure to give substance to its Private
Finance Initiative confirmed just what a bad deal Skye has received.
Early in the campaign, Charles Kennedy and I delivered a
7000-signature petition to the Scottish Office. It was as near to
unanimous a view as the small communities could muster. And it was
ignored.
My sadness is that, for political reasons to which Skye was
peripheral, Highland Regional Council sold the pass and gave its
approval to the high-toll scheme. If it had refused to do so, would it
have been possible for ministers to push ahead?
It is also worth regretting that the rest of the country -- including
Scotland -- paid so little attention to what was being done until it was
too late. What an outcry there would have been if the same scheme had
been proposed for the Forth or Erskine bridges!
What of the future? We still do not know what is in the small print of
the Tory deal with Miller-Dyfwig. There is a big difference between the
public purse accepting liability for the cost of the bridge -- and it
also agreeing to compensate the developers for hypothetical profits over
20 or 30 years. Personally, I would have no stomach for the latter.
Meanwhile, the Government of ''competition'' has denied Caledonian
McBrayne the right to compete. The Government of ''choice'' has forced
the highest-toll bridge in Europe on communities that do not want it.
In all of these circumstances, who better to collect the first toll
than Michael Forsyth!

CHARLES KENNEDY, Skye's MP, prefers to remain an island himself at
this juncture
TODAY's party is one that I've decided to pass up. This is not a burst
of new-found moralism in keeping with the apparent spirit of the
Blair-driven age. No, it is a straightforward acknowledgement that to
sup the hospitality which will accompany the Skye-high bridge tolls
would constitute a two-finger salute and a kick in the teeth for the
constituents I'm supposed to represent. So today I am otherwise engaged.
I hope that the Secretary of State is reading this supplement. He may
care to reflect upon the other absent friends not around and about him
as he part-performs the opening ceremony. Calum Macdonald, Labour MP for
the Western Isles, has declined his invitation for reasons identical to
my own. Skye and Lochalsh District Council, like Calum and myself not
normally indulgers in the gesture school of politics, have voted with
their feet as well.
When the original package was voted through by Highland Regional
Council, two out of the three then representatives of the local area
voted aginst the toll-imposed injustice, and the one who voted for it
was unceremoniously dumped by the electorate shortly afterwards,
defeated by an opponent of the bridge.
Today, therefore, Michael Forsyth will attend an event which does not
carry the endorsement or participation of any significant level of
elected public representation from within the communities directly
affected.
I hope he carries that unmistakable message back to the corridors of
power. But somehow I doubt it. Indeed, if anything, he is likely to use
the occasion to stress all the more the undoubted benefits which he sees
deriving from this flagship of the Private Finance Initiative.
So be it. Knowing only too well the strength of passion which locally
perceived injustice can arouse on Skye, I shall risk this prediction . .
.
These tolls will, in due course, have to be drastically pruned, if not
by this Government then by its successor. The howling unfairness, and
self-defeating economics, will win through in the end. Of that I remain
optimistic.
Since 1983, when the constituency of Ross, Cromarty and Skye came into
being (the parliamentary boundary commissioners are turning it into
Ross, Skye and Inverness West at the next general election) I have
learned the tenacity with which the island fights its corner.
That island identity generates a profound sense of shared community
which politicians ignore at their peril.
I knew very little about Skye at the outset, despite being from Fort
William myself. So, as a fresh-faced young candidate, I went off to seek
advice from the great sage of Carbost himself, the then Mr Russell
Johnston MP.
''What's your view on capital punishment?'' was his first enquiry.
''I am against reintroduction,'' I told him.
''You might find that issue coming up at public meetings,'' he said,
but counselled: ''I always found it useful to point out that there
hadn't been a murder on Skye for well over a century.''
The really useful piece of advice he did impart was not to make the
campaign error of visiting Skye but once during a three- to four-week
election campaign. He always made a day-long visit during each week of
the election itself, a recipe I have followed assiduously over three
campaigns now.
It does make a difference in terms of momentum and enables you to keep
your ear to the ground over how people's opinions are developing.
I shall never forget my final visit on the Monday of polling week
during that first campaign. We felt things were going well. Although I
didn't for a moment think I was going to win, spirits were running high.
On the Monday morning the campaign car rolled on to the ferry plastered
with Vote Kennedy and Kennedy X stickers and posters.
I got out to enjoy the fresh air at which point a very enthusiastic
man came over. ''Where is he? Where is he? I've always wanted to meet
him!'' This is music to any candidate's ears to I gave him the full
treatment. His face registered increasing disappoinment until he
explained: ''Ach I thought it was Calum that was coming over.''
You are ever conscious at constituency level of how the local and the
national dimensions inter-relate. Skye's Gaelic college Sabhal Mor
Ostaig, self-evidently is a significant factor in Scottish culture and
education; it's also an important contributor to the fragile economy of
the Sleat peninsula. The Scottish Crofters Union is headquartered at
Broadford and carries a resonance far beyond the island. It is sometimes
underestimated the extent to hich decisions taken on Skye have an
important influence at national level.
And what an array of contrasting individuals to seek to represent! A
man of letters like Sorley Maclean; a historian of the international
clout of Dr Jim Hunter, who now also chairs thelocal enterprise company;
Lady Claire Macdonald of cookery fame; and Sir Iain Noble of land,
banking, Gaelic and now the Skye Bridge itself. Iain Anderson, fish
farmer and rock star used to be partially based on the island. Now
Runrig's Donnie Munro constitutes music world glamour. The list could go
on forever.
In conclusion, I would just recall the marvellous West Highland Free
Press cartoon which coincided with Skye's victorious appearance in the
Camanachd Cup Final at Fort William a few years back. This advised ''the
last person to leave the island to turn out the lights''. That said it
all, really.

THE first serious attempt to present a case for a Skye Bridge was made
in 1938 but abandoned with the onset of war. In 1969, the Scottish
Council Development and Industry prepared a report suggesting a bridge
for Skye to be paid through tolls. It had earlier presented the same
argument in respect of Ballachulish.
In 1984, economist Tony Mackay, having studied transport in Norway,
promoted idea of a Skye toll bridge and the Scottish Office began to
consider it seriously.
In 1985, Highland Regional Council commissioned JMP Consultants to
conduct a feasibiity study. This was published in October 1986 and
concluded that there would be positive economic justification for a
bridge which it was estimated would cost #15m. In January of that year,
the BBC's Gaelic current affairs programme Prosbaig broadcast results of
a profession poll which a showed that 67% of people interviewed on Skye
were in favour of fixed link.
It emerged in 1988 that the Morrison Group had been talking to the
Scottish Office about a privately funded bridge financed through tolls.
Press leaks susgested these were to be based on existing ferry fares. By
January 1989, it was reported at least one other firm was interested.
In August of that year, Scottish Office minister Lord James Douglas
Hamilton tells Highland Regional Council delegation that a privately
funded bridge could be open by 1994, but could not give a date when a
publcily funded bridge could proceed. Council roads and transport
chairman John Young said afterwards it was clear it was a toll bridge or
no bridge for 25 to 30 years.
On October 26, 1989, Highland Regional Council reluctantly voted by 38
votes to seven to accept the privately financed bridge and to set aside
its policy of having no toll bridges in the region. Before the meeting,
the Skye-based West Highland Free Press presented the council convener,
Sandy Russell, with its Over The Sea Toll Free petition with 6500
signatures.
Shortly afterward, the Scottish Office invited applications to build
the privately financed bridge which would be repaid by tolls based on
ferry fares which would last between 16 and 27 years.
In February 1990, a short leet of three designs was revealed by
Scottish Office minister Lord Sanderson of Bowden: Miller Construction,
box girder made of concrete at #23m; Morrison Construction, cable stay
at #30m; and Trafalgar House, box girder made of steel at #26m.
April 1991: announced that Millers, who had been joined in a
consortium by German firm Dywidag, had won the contract, the Scottish
Office to build the approach roads at a cost of #5m to #6m.
Miller/Dywidag's main financial backers were the Bank of America.
October 1991: National Trust for Scotland threatened to force delay,
even cancellation of project because its working party opposed bridge
design. It owned one island in the path of the bridge, Eilean Dubh, and
has superiority over another, Eilean Ban. Government had no power to
compulsory purchase trust properties and would need assent of both
Houses of Parliament. In the end, Trust settled for aesthetic changes
which would cost #1.3m.
November 28, 1991: Secretary of State announced public inquiry into
bridge.
December 16, 1991: Miller/Dywidag sign contract.
January 28 to February 7 1992. Public inquiry under Reporter Miss
Elizabeth Haran sat in Kyle of Lochalsh.
June 24, 1992: Secretary of State Ian Lang gave the official approval
for toll bridge with publication of Miss Haran's report. Mr Lang
rejected Miss Harran's recommendation that the Scottish Office should
make contributions to keep the toll levels down, ''directed solely at
assisting the local economy''. He also refused her recommendation that
he should announce within 12 months an end date for the tolls.
November 10, 1992, Court of Session rejected appeal by objectors
against Mr Lang's decision.
October 16, 1995, bridge opens.

'The one thing that would have helped the economy
here was a free bridge because of the dual
disadvantage of distance and cost; but here we are
having what amounts to a tax being imposed upon us'
* ONE PERSON who will not be turning out to see Michael Forsyth open
the bridge this morning will be Mrs Kathleen MacRae, the treasurer of
the Skye Bridge Appeal Group, and she is asking others to do the same.
Already the group's honorary patrons, MPs Charles Kennedy, Brian
Wilson and Calum MacDonald, and the majority of Skye and Localsh
councillors have said they will be otherwise engaged, but it will be
difficult to gauge how successful the boycott will prove.
This is the latest move by a group that was set up in Kyleakin Village
Hall on a dirty November night in 1992, to draw together all the
different strands of opposition to the high-toll bridge project, the
flagship of private road building in Scotland.
It was born out of a sense of frustration and impotence, that nothing
could stop the bridge which the vast majority of islanders wanted, but
not at any price, and certainly not at the government's price - the
highest tolls in Europe. Others meanwhile objected to its design and to
the environmental damage it could cause.
Three of its members formed the Skye Boat Company to try and run a car
ferry in direct competition to the bridge and are still trying, while
the group has spent the last three years monitoring every move on the
project. The 63-year-old Mrs MacRae was actively campaigning before
then, and in fact has lived and breathed the bridge for the best part of
five years.
She was been a formidable fighter, but will she accept defeat now the
bridge is actually up and working? ''Certainly not. The campaign has got
to keep going. Our aim must be to get rid of the tolls, or at very least
reduce them significantly.
''We must keep the pressure on the Government. After all this is the
government which claims a great victory in getting the Highlands and
Islands classified as an Objective One area, in other words one of the
poorest and most deprived in Europe.
''I would have thought the European Commission might have wanted to
know why it was that one of the poorest areas in Europe were having to
pay the highest bridge tolls in Europe. Why should Europe be sending all
these millions over when our own Government is doing this?
''It is a negation of democracy, a negation of accountability, and the
complete antithesis of every piece of propaganda the government has put
forward about their policy of the free market, competition and choice.
It is a private monopoly.
''The one thing that would have helped the economy here and in the
Outer Isles was a free bridge because of the dual disadvantage of
distance and cost. But here we are having what amounts to a tax being
imposed upon us. Michael Forsyth can't bleat on about the extra taxes a
Scottish Parliament would bring.''
Surely the people of the island will just be paying what they are
already paying on the ferry, even a lttle less?
''This one has to be nailed. You are not comparing like with like.
What we have is a few hundred metres of road. Even the Scottish Office
styled it as an extension of the A37 at the public inquiry. We shouldn't
compare the bridge to the ferry but to other toll bridges.
''Take the Dartford bridge. It cost #86m, more than three times this
one, yet they just pay 80p or 90p. And they have an alternative. Our
alternative in the winter, if we wanted to take a car off, would be to
go out to Uist or Harris and then drive through the islands and then
back to either Oban or Ullapool.''
''The more you think about it, the angrier you get. There was so much
said that was intellectually dishonest. If you are genuinely going to
have consultation, that is one thing, but to pretend that you are taking
people's views into account but all the time you have made up your mind,
that is quite another thing.''
Mrs MacRae is clear that the only true democratic test would have been
to ask the people of Skye in a referendum if they were willing to wait
20 years for a toll-free bridge, as the government had indicated the
delay, or whether they would accept the present package.
''People here have been demanding a bridge for a long time, but I
don't think anybody thought they were going to be landed with a toll
bridge charging the same as the ferries. They might have been thinking
about the Forth Bridge or the Erskine Bridge, or something a wee bit
more, maybe even #1.
''There is a growing recognition here that we are paying the price of
the government's lunatic rush to get this project on the statute book
before the last election. If they had not been so determined to do that,
if Highland Region had not been so desperate to accommodate government
plans, and if the National Trust had not been bullied into submission,
it could have been very different.
''The Skye Bridge could have qualified for some of the #262m of
Objective One money and we could have been here watching a toll-free
bridge going up.''
It is clear that Kathleen MacRae is very serious about carrying on
fighting the tolls. Just as she did, some years back, over pay beds in
the MacKinnon Memorial Hospital in Broadford, and earlier against a new
road which was to have cut through local crofts.
It is all a long way from Colinton in Edinburgh, from whence she
sprang. Her father was secretary of the old University Club in Princes
Street which merged, postwar, with the socially prestigious New Club,
where he, as its professional treasurer, would have been rubbing
shoulders with the fathers and grandfathers of some of her current
opponents.
An occupational therapist by profession, she has been a lifelong
Liberal. ''I have been a Liberal since I was knee-high to an opinion
pollster.'' She married an Edinburgh-based Skyeman, part of the Gaelic
diaspora whose people had come to own a hotel in the capital. His
parents were both from the Breakish townships (upper and lower) near
Broadford, and in 1977 Kathleen and Ian ''retired'' to Breakish. Their
daughter spent her secondary years at Portree High.
Retirement in Skye brought Kathleen up against issues of island life
and she saw a need to fight to defend local interest. She had no
campaigning pedigree to call on from the capital, she simply blames it
on ''the Skye air''. At the very least, her activities, and those of the
appeal group, provided an important watchdog operation on a most
controversial project.
In the meantime, Kathleen MacRae is just hopeful that as many people
as possible will boycott the opening today. ''I think the only thing we
can do today is to stay away from Mr Forsyth's ceremony. The Skye Bridge
was to be the flagship of private enterprise road-buliding in Scotland,
all to show Downing Street that the Scottish Office were equal to the
demands of Thatcherism. ''
''It is sad enough that among the last Scottish symbols of Thatcherism
which might survive into the twenty-first century will be the toll
stations on the bridge. So the fewer people that are there to see the
flagship launched, the better.''

'The workforce have taken great pride in the job,
working in pretty inhospitable conditions. They
also have been well received by the local people,
regardless of their understandable concerns'
* IN JULY, when the two arms of the bridge finally met above the Kyle
of Lochalsh, Skye was physically connected to the mainland for the first
time since the ice bridges of the last Ice Age, some 10,000 years ago.
Despite the controversy that has attended the project since its
conception over six years ago, few can deny the final result is a fairly
extraordinary piece of engineering which looks better than many dared
hope.
It is something of which the men who worked on it are immensely proud.
They never wanted to get involved in the debate over funding. They were
just men, and a few women, building a bridge.
It took quite a lot of building as John Henderson, the Strathpeffer
man appointed project manager by Miller/Dywidag very patiently explained
to the Herald one evening in Kyle, and the next morning in, on and
underneath the bridge . . .
''The design is what we call a balanced free cantilever. The reason
for that is that you start off with a pier on either side of the gap you
are going to bridge, and you work out from the piers building out the
deck in segments which range from 3.25m to 5m in length until the two
arms meet in the middle. But every time you build out, say, 5m towards
the middle you have got to balance that by building out in the other
direction from the pier, back towards the mainland or back towards Skye.
''It is called free cantilvering because there are no additional
supports, no stays as on a cable stayed bridge. With this design it is
purely the strength of the concrete and the prestressing tendons in the
top deck and the balancing effect of building out in the opposite
direction that sustain it.
''In this case it had to be strong enough for a clear span in the main
bridge, between the piers, concrete to concrete, of 250m. That makes it
one of the largest bridges in the world.
''To put it in perspective, you have the equivalent length of Hampden
Park projecting out from both sides of either pier each comprising 5,500
tonnes of concrete and steel. Because of the weight, if you just went
straight out to meet the deck coming from the other side, both arms
would dip the further they went out. So you have to build them both so
that they are heading higher up and by the time they meet they will have
dipped to the same level.''
Apparently it is seen as a fairly routine technique now after 40 years
of development -- Dywidag, the German side of the bridge-building
consortium, having pioneered it. But certainly what is not appreciated
from the ground is that the bridge itself is hollow. To the technically
challenged layman standing inside, it is far more like a subterranean
tunnel than a concrete box reaching through the air.
''It starts of at the piers 12.5m high, which is like a six-storey
building and in the middle it is 4.7m high and about 6m wide. It is
essentially an arch, but you need the height for the strength at the
piers, and then it tapers into the middle. This allows the bridge to
carry service cables and pipes for telecommunications and water to and
from the island.''
But before any of this could be tackled, the foundations of the bridge
had to be put in. No simple matter. It involved two caissons being
constructed over at the old Howard Doris yard at Loch Kishorn.
''We towed them down to the site. Now they sit on top of underwater
cliffs at either side of the 25m channel. They are about 14m below high
water at the bottom so firstly we had to dig a socket in the rock. Then
the caisson was tied to a barge stationed near to this socket before it
was winched into position and lowered with the tide.
''We had to flood the caisson with water to weight it down the last
wee bit because the tide wouldn't take it all the way.
''Sand ballast was used to trim the caissons for the tow from Kishorn
just as for a boatd. When the caisson is sitting in its socket it is
vulnerable to storms and might shift so we drilled three pairs of
anchors into the rock to hold it in place and the sand and water to be
removed without the caisson refloating.
''Once the water was out we started to build the base which is a big
slab with about 1,000 cubic metres of concrete in it. Then we started
building the pier inside it, which rises about 22m above the water.
''At the same time we also built an auxiliary pier at the edge of each
caisson. These are temporary and are needed to help the main pier to
support the first piece of the deck which is built on top of the piers.
It is from this building block that we start to build out the sections
of the deck.
''We built out the first piece of the deck on July 19, 1994, and we
joined the two arms up on July 29, 1995. But the first caisson had gone
in on March 2, 1993, so an awful lot of work had to go in before we
could built out the first deck.
''The most difficult thing was digging the holes in the seabed during
the winter months when all these marine operations should have been done
during the summer. At one point we had 40 divers working but you could
only put them to work when the conditions are right.''
The delay in starting the contract is now the subject of a claim,
thought to be in the region of #5m, by Miller/Dywidag against the
Scottish Office; but John Henderson is not willing to discuss that. He
prefers to concentrate on the project.
''The bridge is strong. The density of the reinforcement is very high,
equivalent in some places to that found in nuclear power stations. This
meant we had to add the concrete in a very liqiud form so it got in
about the reinforcement. We managed that, but it wasn't easy. We had to
have a lot of trials.
''The bridge is designed to withstand anything it might have to:
impacts from 10,000-tonne vessels or even earthquakes. There is 304
miles of prestressing strand in the structure and this is equivalent to
the distance from here to Newcastle. There are also 75,000 tonnes of
steel and concrete and I don't know what you would compare that to.
''In terms of effort, though, more than three quarter of a million man
hours have gone into this so far.'' John Henderson pays tribute to his
workforce. ''It has not just been any other contract to them; they
really have been totally committed to it. They have taken great pride in
it, working in pretty inhospitable conditions. They also have been well
recived by the local people, regardless of their understandable
concerns.
''From the start we decided that there shoud not be a works camp,
which has often caused trouble in the past. We didn't want a 'them and
us' approach. We have all been living in guest houses or digs which I
believe has allowed us to blend in. It certainly has allowed us to make
a contribution to the local economy. Look at this pub -- what would it
be like normally on a Monday night at this time of year?''
What now for John Henderson.? ''Well I am the same as all the rest. I
will be looking for a new project. I just fear that after this, anything
is going to be an anticlimax.''

WOMEN'S WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP
BRITAIN'S Laura Davies let slip a three-stroke lead and was beaten in
a play-off in the World Championship of Women's Golf in South Korea.
Sweden's Annika Sorenstam forced the play-off and then rolled in a
40-foot chip shot on the first extra hole to win #78,000 from a purse of
#316,000 and reinforce her No.1 standing on this year's American LPGA
earnings list.
''I am a bit disappointed,'' said Davies, who received #43,000 for
second place. ''I played very well, but putted poorly. I just couldn't
make anything. The conditions were tough out there due to the wind,''
she added.
It was 25-year-old Sorenstam's third LPGA victory this year after the
US Open and the GHP Heartland Classic at St Louis last month.
For the second successive day, the weather was a major factor. The
start of yesterday's play was delayed for 90 minutes by steady rain and
dense fog on the 6188-yard, par-72 Paradise Golf Course on Cheju, a
resort island off South Korea's south coast.
When the sun came out, the wind gusted, affecting most of the 16
players, and Sorenstam and fifth-placed Meg Mallon were the only ones to
beat par.
Final scores (Americans unless stated):
282 -- A Sorenstam (Sweden) 72, 69, 71, 70; L Davis (England) 67, 71,
71, 73. Sorenstam won play-off.

MARIE-Laure de Lorenzi, the Barcelona-based French star, sprinted to
an impressive third win of the season yesterday. A final-round 71 in the
Nestle French Open at St Endreol gave her a nine-under-par aggregate of
210 -- 10 clear of Scotland's Kathryn Marshall who shared second place
with Alison Nicholas and Sally Prosser.
It is the third time de Lorenzi has won the French title, and she
moves to the top of the Solheim Cup standings.
Earlier this season de Lorenzi won the Dutch Open by nine strokes. She
started the final round four strokes clear of Julie Forbes, the holder,
from Aboyne and increased her lead to five at the final turn before
gathering birdies at the four par-5 holes coming home.
Marshall birdied the seventh and eighth to turn in 34. Another birdie
at the long fourteenth took her to two under before disaster struck at
the 326-yard final hole. She pushed her drive into a bush and, after a
penalty drop, played back on to the fairway. She then topped her fourth
shot into a bunker and took a triple bogey 7. Leading final scores
(British or Irish unless stated):
210 -- M-L de Lorenzi (Fra) 71 68 71 (#9000).
220 -- S Prosser 73, 76, 71; K Marshall 76, 71, 73; A Nicholas 71, 75,
74 (#4510 each).
221 -- R Hetherington (Australia) 74, 76, 71; K Orum (Denmark) 79, 70,

'It makes a real statement. The
way it springs in the air over
to Skye is almost like an animal
crouching. It has turned out a lot
better than people were fearing'
THE choice of Sir Iain Noble to succeed the late Sir Robert Cowan to
the #15,000-a-year chairmanship of Skye Bridge Ltd took many aback when
it was announced in May, 1994.
The merchant banker, landowner, hotel proprietor and Gaelic enthusiast
had actually been opposed to the bridge, and was an official objector at
the public inquiry in February 1992, when he declared: ''I do not think
the bridge will be a magic wand to bring a lot of prosperity to Skye.''
This in itself was surprising, because in the mid-Sixties, when
working for the Scottish Council for Development and Industry, Sir Iain
had proposed a private enterprise toll bridge for Ballachulish, and
subsequently for Skye. He insists that he has never changed his views.
''I was an objector on the basis that I thought it a waste of scarce
government funds to put up a third of the cost by way of the approach
roads - a good many millions of pounds; that there was a desperate need
for capital in Skye to get the economy going; and that there were better
ways of spending such money on Skye.
''I felt that it was more economical to get people across by ferry.
The ferry company, Caledonian MacBrayne, was making a big profit on the
route, the Government would be losing that profit and CalMac would then
have to increase its fares in other places. I also made the point that,
in effect, the Government could borrow money more cheaply by an issue of
its own stock rather than by borrowing from a syndicate of banks at
commercial rates.
''These are the points I made to the inquiry and the Scottish Office
direct. I don't feel any need to withdraw them: they are as valid today
as they were then.''
So why, then, the obvious attractions of #15,000 apart, did Sir Iain
accept the chairmanship?
''I must admit I took a deep breath when I was asked, but then, having
weighed it up, I said to myself: What is the point in going on opposing
something that is going to happen anyway? We don't want to be down in
the mouth.
''Secondly, I hope there is an advantage in having somebody connected
with Skye in a position that has at least a bit of influence within the
bridge. I was 90% certain that if I didn't do it they had somebody in
Edinburgh in mind, and I knew the sort of people who were being
canvassed. So I concluded that there was a benefit to Skye to have
somebody in the heart of things, and so it would be irresponsible not to
take the opportunity.
''One has a responsibility and loyalty to colleagues, but that doesn't
mean that one has to say anything one doesn't believe, and I hope I
would never be accused of doing that.
''I haven't changed my mind. I now think that, since the bridge is
there, let's make the best possible use of it.''
Sir Iain said he was very relieved by the appearance of the bridge and
believes that people will begin to be quite affectionate about it.
''It makes a real statement. The way it springs in the air over to
Skye is almost like an animal crouching. It has turned out a lot better
than people were fearing. Almost everybody I have met coming on visits
to Skye has commented on how splendid it looks. I have never met anyone
who has said anything against it.''
Sir Iain has, however, heard quite a lot said against the tolls, and
can understand the concern. He prefers to call them fares, which sounds
fairer to him. He stresses that, at #5.20 for a private car, these fares
will be cheaper by 20p than the current ferry fare. In addition, last
year CalMac did not offer a winter discount, whereas the bridge tolls
will drop to #4.30 for cars during the winter months.
''Compared to the last 12 months of the ferry operation, there is a 5%
reduction in the summer times and 20% in the six months off-season. So,
if you like, there is an overall reduction of 12.5% for motor cars,
which is something to be cheerful about.''
He thought the biggest plus the bridge would bring would be for
businesses, particularly hauliers, who faced an added cost if their
wagons had to wait even 20 minutes for a ferry. More trips would be
completed in a day and savings should be reflected in the
competitiveness of goods on Skye.
''People won't go round charging extra because Skye is an island, as
some do now.''
One group who will not be so cheered are small businessmen and
tradesmen who run LGVs or vans between 1.5 tons and 3.5 tons unloaded.
If they are 5m or less in length, they currently cross the ferry at the
same rate as a private car. Under the tolling regime it is #9.80 in
summer and winter, and even with a book of discounted tickets, they will
still be paying well in excess of #9.
Sir Iain does not see this as an insurmountable problem. ''Basically,
you have to decide on the value of the goods, and whether it is better
trying to send them by a big lorry or pack it into a car. The LGV
drivers can always swap their van for an estate vehicle if it makes that
much difference.
''People can always change the kind of cars they use. I don't think
that is a major hiccup. I guess this must have been overlooked at the
time of the inquiry and when the Act of Parliament was being drawn up.
''I don't know what the what the right level of tolls is. I have
enjoyed as an academic argument, putting forward the point that if the
tolls were lower, the bridge would never be paid off.
''There is a case for saying: Let's put the tolls up much higher so we
can pay the damn thing off in five to 10 years. On balance, the idea of
trying to pay it off in 15 to 20 years is about right. It's like paying
a mortgage off on a house, then you hand it on to your descendants
loan-free.''
Sir Iain accepts that it would be open to any future government to pay
over a lump sum to reduce the toll burden, but he would oppose that. ''I
would argue, as a Skyeman, that if the government suddenly had #5m or
#20m to give to Skye as a present, it would be a total waste of money to
give it to Skye Bridge Ltd to pay off its loan.
''With that sort of money you could create full employment on the
island for the next 50 years. Much more fruitful.''
So what of the proposal to run a car ferry in direct competition to
the bridge?
''It is a free world, and if somebody thinks they want to do it, they
should. I think it would be wrong to defend a monopoly, but while any
tourist is obviously entitled to use a ferry if they want to, any local
person knows that by using the ferry he or she is prolonging the period
we must wait for the bridge to become toll free.''
Recently Sir Iain had been reported as saying he thought that one of
the benefits of a high toll would be that it would serve to defend the
fragile Gaelic culture on the island. Surely he had his tongue somewhere
in the general area of his cheek?
''Not at all. It is a fact that Gaelic in Skye was at a very low ebb
and it is just beginning to feel the blood coming back into its veins.
If you suddenly exposed it to a sort of Blackpool mob, it would be very
difficult for it to survive. I think the fact that there is a toll for a
few years gives Comunn na Gaidhlig (the statutory Gaelic development
body) an opportunity to get things really on the road, before the
overwhelming crowds swamp in.
''It is true that Gaelic is surviving in areas without a bridge, like
Ardnamurchan, but at least the tolls give it a chance to get its act
together.''
In the meantime, Sir Iain is determined to ensure that the bridge acts
as a real gateway to the island. He is hoping that it will be possible
to erect a lifesize statue of the Norwegian Princess, Saucy Mary, who
was supposed to have charged tolls on vessels using the Kyle of Lochalsh
by stretching a huge chain across the water.
Sir Iain wants to model Saucy Mary on the Copenhagen Mermaid. Indeed,
ever since his his appointment as chairman he has been determined to
make the most of the bridge. He told a public meeting in Kyleakin one
night of his hope that crossing the bridge would be an experience, and
that people would know they were in Skye. This led one local man to
observe:
''It will certainly be an experience, and if you have just paid a
fiver to cross a bridge, you will fairly quickly guess you are in
Skye.''

'Yes, I suppose it is a backward step, but sometimes you have to move
back to go forward. Next year will be difficult'
IT IS in the eyes. Grand prix drivers all seem to have burning looks
which can pierce a person's very soul.
As they sit on the grid cocooned in their cockpits while engineers
fuss around making last-minute adjustments to the shiny and colourful
machines, only the eyes of the drivers are visible. They stare straight
ahead, fixed, and deep as though great secrets kept hidden from the rest
of us are unfolding.
Different sportsmen describe this level of concentration in different
ways. For instance, a tennis player, who is so focused he feels his
racket to be 10 times its normal size would say he was ''in the
groove,'' while a baseball player might say after having whacked out of
sight every kind of ball hurled at him that he had been ''in the zone.''
There are strange stories from the sporting world concerning altered
states of mind, those times when athletes have felt controlled by
peculiar perceptions of time and space, and because Formula 1 racing is
such a high risk occupation, the strengths of a driver's mentality and
temperament are as critical as the design of his car.
In such a world, it isn't difficult to accept drivers can reach a
state where they feel exalted, as though an aura radiates about them.
The late Ayrton Senna had it, and a presence which was almost palpable
affording him a much larger status than his slight physical appearance
merited. This is one of the signs of greatness, and while people like
Senna, or Pele, or Muhammad Ali, pass through this world only rarely
there are lots of sports persons who experience being in the groove.
The greater the degree of concentration required and the more a person
has to shut out all outside influences, the greater are the chances of
this athlete entering ''the zone,'' and that is why a grand prix in
those final minutes before the lights change to green can be such a
profoundly tense space and time. Eyes which never seem to blink peer
straight ahead seeing race lines through the track's various bends.
Motor racing places a human in the middle of the most sophisticated
technology and expects man and machine to push ever onward to new and
outrageous limits. The sport tends, then, to foster strong and insular
types.
One of them, David Coulthard, might have elaborated further on the
relationship between science and sport had his mouth not been full of
food. The young Scottish driver, who is about to finish his first full
year in Formula 1 with Williams and prepare to start again in a McLaren
car, was enjoying a roll and sausage in The Herald restaurant.
''Haven't had one of these for ages,'' he said. Monaco living has its
advantages, but it doesn't have everything. It doesn't have the types
who man The Herald car park...''don't care who you are, you're not
parking in here, son.''
Coulthard knows people. Consider, he was sacked by Williams, who have
taken on Jacques Villeneuve for next season, but if the 24-year-old is
annoyed, it doesn't surface. Since he still has three more races to go
before the end of this season, he is reluctant to talk much about his
time with Williams, but word has it that he had decided to move to
McLaren before his current team had said they were appointing
Villeneuve.
However, recently Coulthard's driving has been closer to the standards
expected of him, and he won his first grand prix in Estoril last month.
It is believed his Williams team have admitted they acted a shade too
hastily in allowing him to go so easily.
Also, his two-year contract with the Mercedes-backed organisation is
said to be worth a couple of million in the belief he has the potential
to become world champion.
Nevertheless, Coulthard is moving to a team struggling to regain their
leading status. ''Yes, I suppose it is a backward step, but sometimes
you have to move back to go forward,'' he said. ''Next year will be
difficult, and I am prepared for that, but if I can finish sixth in the
drivers' championship, then I will have done well.
''McLaren and Mercedes are not playing at this, they are one of the
top four teams in Formula 1 and they will get it right.''
There were times this season when Coulthard felt he was not being
given the same attention as his Williams team-mate Damon Hill, but
curiously, he has had no cause to complain since news of his team's
changes, which were probably politically motivated, leaked out.
Simple logic suggests a French-speaking driver might please Renault,
who also supply Benetton, but ironically, Coulthard may be benefitting.
''It seems I am being given more focus by the team who might be saying
let's do something for him before he leaves, but whatever the reason, I
feel much better,'' he said.
After a bright start, his season was affected adversely because of a
bout of tonsilitis which deprived him of some of the strength required
to perform properly in a sport which makes enormous demands on the
resilience of its participants. He admits his ''mid-season form was not
good'' and that Williams had reason to doubt.
His relationship with Hill has always been strained perhaps because
the Englishman knew quickly that his younger team-mate was not in awe of
him. Hill was never allowed to take liberties.
Coulthard will not be fooled by flattery either and of Michael
Schumacher's desire to have him race with him in the Ferrari team next
year, he said: ''That would have been my quickest route out of Formula
1.''
Schumacher, who has virtually secured the world championship for the
second-successive year, demands full attention from his team and the
second driver is given little opportunity to excel.
Coulthard's McLaren team-mate for next season, Mika Hakkinen, is bound
to benefit from the change of partner because the Scot is regarded as
one of the best test drivers and he will be able to help the team in
their quest to improve. ''I am going to McLaren because I believe we can
do something together,'' he said.
''The money is good but what I want most is to be recognised as having
been one of the top drivers when this is all over.''
There have been a couple of occasions this season when he made basic
errors, but to his credit, he didn't hide behind technical jargon.
''I made a bad mistake at Monza and after my car had been pushed into
the garage by the mechanics they left me sitting alone as the door was
pulled down. I felt like a child whose behaviour had disgusted them
all,'' he recalled.
''I didn't know what to do or say, but while I could have sought out
the weakest member of the team and blamed him I apologised to them all.
If I mess up I say sorry.
It is while talking about race situations that his eyes take on that
fixed look again.Coulthard is a racer. You can see it in his eyes.

#1.8m Scot settles in at Blackburn.
Billy McKinlay will not become the Jean-Marc Bosman of Scottish
football. Instead, the Scottish midfielder has been sold to Blackburn
Rovers and his contract with Dundee United, which was the subject of a
court action, has ended.
So has the court case, which would have been heard in December, and
which, in light of the Bosman decision, would surely have made
26-year-old McKinlay a free agent, able to negotiate any deal he wished
without the Tayside club being entitled to any kind of transfer fee
That way justice would have been seen to be done. But football is not
big on justice, certainly not as big as the game is in clinging to a
past which allowed young players to be peruaded into accepting long-term
deals which were not in their interests.
McKinlay's case, if it had gone to court and succeeded, would have
freed other players from their Tannadice bondage. There is no option
clause any longer, but the wrongs perpetrated under the former system
have been allowed to stand.
Now they probably never will be. The McKinlay case was the best
chance, but whenever he signed for the English champions his contract
became null and void, and therefore the legal action fell. You simply
cannot challenge a contract which is no longer in operation. That is the
law.
And so, no doubt there will be those who will criticise McKinlay for
not following through with the action he raised more than a year ago.
Personally, I find it difficult to blame him. He signed a contract when
he was a teenager and it has lasted for around eight long years and
suddenly, he was handed a glimpse of a glistening future in the
Premiership. Who can honestly say he was wrong to take that?
McKinlay has paid his dues and he was professional enough to know that
Blackburn would not be happy to wait until December to have his
services. He had to make his decision.
In Stockholm last week with the Scottish team, he would hear talk
about the challenges of the English game and the money which can be
earned. No doubt, like so many Dundee United players before him, he
would be too embarrassed to reveal his own meagre earnings.
Years ago, I can remember a Tannadice star confiding in me: ''You
listen to all the talk about the wages and it is really embarrassing.
Some of us have trouble getting a good mortgage, because the basic
salaries at the club are so low.''
I doubt if anything has changed too much in the intervening seasons
for the long-serving Tannadice men, who are prone to referring to their
place of employment as Colditz.
Some of them will be fortunate if their basic wage tops #20,000 a
year, a figure which is boosted by appearance money and bonuses.
McKinlay, though, has left that behind him. He won't discuss the court
case and he won't talk about the problem years he spent on Tayside. The
player only wants to look to the future and the hope which now lies
there for himself and his family.
He was on the bench at the weekend and will play with the reserves
tonight as he bids to slot in with his new club. He said yesterday:
''The whole place is just so alive. I was sitting in the dressing room
yesterday surrounded by international players -- Alan Shearer, David
Batty, Lars Bohinen, Henning Berg, Colin Hendry and the rest.
''It was then I knew I had made the right decision. I had the chance
to stay in Scotland with Celtic, but professionally, there is more to
prove to myself in the Premiership. Every game is a big game and anyone
who really knows me will accept that it was not only money which took me
south.
''In fact, when I turned down the Celtic offer I did not even have
permission to talk to Blackburn. When I was told I could talk to them
the decision was obvious.
''The new stadium is magnificent. So is the training ground, which
they have spent millions on. And the way everyone tries to make you feel
at home is special, too. Yesterday my wife, Donna, drove down for the
game in case I was playing and she didn't have a car park pass, so there
was a little bit of a problem until Kenny Dalglish gave up his parking
space for her. She could not believe it. All these little things count
so much.''
The Scotland player is readying himself for a battle to make the first
team and stay there. He knows the #1.8m fee which Blackburn splashed out
for him is small change compared to what the club has spent on others.
But he says: ''I don't mind competition. I took a look at the midfield
players, realised they are all quality performers and internationalists
and reckoned that none of them would just turn over and lie down and let
me into the side. I will have to earn my place and I'm prepared to do
just that.''
When he does, he will find the rewards for just the rest of this
season much, much more than he could ever have dreamed about in his
seemingly endless years on Tayside.

'In every way these combatants were well matched -- Els 6ft 3ins tall
and 15 stone, Elkington 6ft 2ins and conceding barely a stone in weight.
Both have high, wide and handsome swings and each, of course, has a
major championship to his name. '
THE paradox of the Toyota World Matchplay championship was that after
an uncommonly subdued four days of golf probably the most exciting
single shot was the No.2 iron Ernie Els struck at the thirty-fifth hole
of the final yesterday at Wentworth. The ball ran over the edge of the
cup, some 12 feet beyond, thus ensuring the worth of the South African's
lead.
In defeating Australia's Steve Elkington, the US PGA Champion, by 2
and 1, Els, 26 tomorrow and last year's US Open Champion, became the
first player since Seve Ballesteros 10 years ago to retain a title that
has eluded the grasp of few of the greatest players of their generation.
By earning the first prize of #170,000, Els became only the second
player, after Hale Irwin, 20 years ago, to win the event at his first
two attempts. His fourth victory of 1995, following two in South Africa
and one on the US tour, promoted Els from fourth place to second, behind
Greg Norman, but ahead of Nick Price and Bernhard Langer, on the Sony
world rankings.
''Neither of us really brought our A-games to the final,'' Els
reflected. ''But now I can say I've had a very good year, although I
doubt that I'm ready yet to be No.1 in the world.'' An old head on young
shoulders, he was asked? ''No,'' he replied. ''But we're working on
that.''
On a mixed day of bright sunshine and threatening cloud but little
wind to speak of, Els was six under for his completed holes on the West
course, but Elkington only one. The Australian admitted: ''I just wasn't
striking the ball well enough to attack the flagstick as often as I
wanted to and get within birdie range.'' He still finished #90,000 the
richer.
Perhaps the pivotal hole was the last in the morning. Els, comfortably
four up with five to play, suddenly lost his driving and three holes.
After he had come up short of the home green, Elkington pushed a No.4
iron and Els pitched to eight feet to win and enjoy a leisurely two-hour
lunch break two ahead again.
When Els took two of the first three post-prandial holes to be four
up, an early conclusion looked likely until his opponent took three of
the next four holes, two with birdies. But for the fourth time in the
championship, the approach over the water to the eighth green defeated
Elkington.
Somehow, it was symptomatic of this low-key contest -- in which only
15 of the 35 holes changed hands and only 15 birdies were recorded --
that the next eight holes should be halved, two fewer than the record
sequence of 10 set by Langer and Ballesteros.
In every way these combatants were well matched -- Els 6ft 3ins tall
and 15 stone, Elkington 6ft 2ins and conceding barely a stone in weight.
Both have high, wide and handsome swings and each, of course, has a
major championship to his name. They also have the power which reduces
par-5 holes to a driver and short iron.
If the finalists thus represented modern golfers, aided by the
technological advances in the game's implements and balls, they departed
from established custom in one important and welcome respect. The first
round took only three hours and the delay of half an hour in starting
their afternoon round may not have been entirely attributable to the
BBC's television programming.
Originally the match between Langer and Costantino Rocca for third
place was to have started an hour ahead of the final's second round. The
thought, quite unconfirmed, occurred that, given Langer's notoriously
painstaking approach, the other objective was to avoid the embarrassment
of this match being caught up by the finalists.
If the pace of play was consistent, the pattern the first round
adopted was not. Els won four out of six holes from the seventh, three
of them with birdies, to advance from one down to three up, but those
last five holes introduced new levels of waywardness.
It is true that compared with many of the 31 previous championships
this one lacked the well-spring of matchplay -- emotion, turbulence, and
melodrama. When Ben Crenshaw reduced his deficit against Rocca by eight
holes to three a vintage recovery such as Gary Player so memorably
effected in 1965 after having been seven down with 17 to play against
Tony Lema, seemed possible.
That it was not to be and that almost all the other games seemed
pedestrian too, could not disguise the fact that the scoring reflected
the excellent condition of the 6957-yard course -- playing to its length
and in splendid order but, as Els's opening 64 declared, rendered
vulnerable by the unusually calm and warm weather.
Thus, until the short fourteenth, Els had had only one bogey in 82
holes, Elkington one in 85 holes. Whereupon Els fluffed a chip and
savagely hooked two drives, yielding to par three times, and Elkington
hooked one drive and made only par to lose the last, as he saw it a
psychological blow. At lunch, Elkington confined summarising his game to
a four-letter world.
Words of a more positive nature were the prerogative of Rocca after
his 2 and 1 victory, worth #50,000, over Langer in what has long been
regarded as the superfluous match for third place. All square with three
to play, Rocca finished 3, 4 -- both birdies -- after neither of his tee
shots at the sixteenth and long seventeenth found the fairway.
From a bunker at the former hole, the Italian hit a No.9 iron to
within three feet and No.5 iron to 10 feet at the latter, where both
players drove into rough.
Langer has indicated that he will not compete in the championship
again because those not seeded have to play an extra two rounds. The
conciliation of #40,000 evidently is not enough.

In the beginning . . . TONY MACKAY, founding director of Mackay
Consultants, recalls his role and looks to the future
'The bridge will bring three main economic benefits: it will make a
more attractive location for small manufacturing businesses; it will
reduce transport costs for existing businesses; and it will boost
tourism'
I SUPPOSE that I must take some of the credit or blame for the Skye
road bridge. In 1984 I wrote the report which first put forward the
concept of a bridge financed by tolls. Eleven years later it has become
a reality.
At the time I had just spent six months working in Norway, which
included travel in the far north and to some of the islands off the
coast. It was evident that the level of economic activity there and the
general standard of living were much higher than in the Highlands and
Islands.
Norwegians give a much higher priority to their rural areas than we do
and their regional development policies are much better financed. A
notable feature in Norway in 1984 was the relatively large number of
islands which were connected by bridges to the mainland or to other
islands. That was - and still is - rare in Scotland.
As a general rule, these islands were much more prosperous than those
which had no bridge. There was a lot of evidence to indicate substantial
improvements in economic activity after the bridges had been built.
My research identified that many of the more recent bridges in Norway
had been financed by tolls. A common system was to have the tolls about
50% higher than the previous ferry fares, in order to have a short
payback period of eight to 10 years. After that, the tolls were removed
and travel across the bridges became free.
I was surprised that virtually everyone I spoke to on the islands
concerned accepted this system. They believed, however, that there would
be substantial economic and social benefits in the long run, which they
were willing to pay for in the short run by relatively high tolls.
The Norwegian communes (local authorities) borrowed the capital cost
involved from the central government, at rates of interest which were
well below the prevailing commercial bank rates.
Returning to Scotland, I became convinced that a similar approach
could work here and Skye was the obvious example. A bridge was not in
Highland Regional Council's plans and both they and the Scottish
Office's Roads Directorate told me that it would be at least 20 years
before it became a serious possibility.
I therefore wrote a short report proposing that a bridge be built
along the lines of the Norwegian system. Highland Regional Council would
borrow the money to finance the construction and the capital and
interest charges would be repaid by setting tolls at a level which would
enable total repayment within no more than 10 years.
I circulated the report to the various parties. The Council
unfortunately showed little interest, though the Scottish Office did.
However, the political climate was such that they did not want to
promote it as a public sector project but rather through the private
sector. The eventual outcome was the invitation to the latter to
finance, build and operate a toll bridge to/from Skye. The rest is
history.
I have strongly supported the concept of the Skye Bridge since 1984
because I believed it would bring substantial economic and social
benefits to the island. I still believe that, although I have some
reservations about the specific project which has now come to fruition.
Skye is a depressed economy, despite the picture given by glossy
brochures from the local enterprise company and the area tourist board.
Economic output, for example, in 1994 was about #80.1m in 1994. Output
per worker averaged #18,631, which was only 76.8% of the Scottish
average. On this indicator, Skye and Lochalsh rank 54th of the 56
district and island authorities in Scotland.
Economic output grew by only 0.9% in 1994, compared with 1.9% in
Scotland as a whole, and the Skye performance was again one of the worst
in the country. That has generally been the case since about 1990.
The latest unemployment figures, for August, show that 7.6% of the
workforce are currently unemployed, which is below the Highland and
Scottish averages, but after the tourist season there is usually a sharp
rise in the level.
Skye is heavily dependent on tourism, which accounts for about 30% of
annual economic output. The manufacturing sector is very small,
comprising the Talisker whisky distillery, a few fish processors, craft
producers and other small businesses. Crofting and fishing continue to
be important, but most jobs are in the service sector, and the public
sector is by far and away the biggest employer.
Some encouraging progress has been made in the fishing and fish
processing industries, with the development of various value added
products, and there is undoubtedly scope for more manufacturing on Skye.
The local enterprise company, Skye and Lochalsh Enterprise (SALE), has a
good record and is actively trying to diversify the local economy.
Nevertheless, tourism will remain the largest single influence on the
Skye economy for the forseeable future. Unfortunately, the number of
tourists coming to Scotland declined by 30% over the 1990-94 period and
the fall in Skye has probably been greater than that.
This year has been much better, partly because of the brilliant
weather during the summer, but there is no guarantee that the decline in
tourism in Scotland is over.
I believe that the Skye bridge will bring three main economic benefits
to the island: it will make it a more attractive location for small
manufacturing businesses; it will reduce transport costs for existing
businesses; and it will boost tourism.
At present, Skye is not particularly attractive for new businesses.
Services are limited, the labour force is small and transport costs can
be a deterrent. Most new businesses which have come to the Highlands
recently have located in Inverness, Fort William or Alness. The bridge
will make Skye much more accessible.
The forecast reduction in transport costs may appear strange in the
light of the current furore over the high level of tolls announced by
the Skye Bridge Company, but it is important to remember that these
costs include travel time. Using the ferry often involves long delays,
particularly during the summer, and businesses have to pay their drivers
and other staff for the time involved.
I am certain that virtually every business on Skye, whether bringing
in goods or sending them out, will benefit from an overall reduction in
transport costs. That should help to make them more competitive and
boost profits.
Thirdly, I expect more visitors because it will be easier and quicker
to get to and from Skye. I know that there is the possibility that the
bridge will encourage some people to "do Skye in a day", but I hope they
will be relatively few in number.
What are my reservations? Well, I would have preferred to have seen a
much shorter payback period, no more than 10 years. The capital cost is
far too high. And the design is awful.

THE Sporting Diary has an abiding interest in ritual. We are second to
none in our rigorous study of social mores in a sports context.
Especially if there is a good dinner and a drink involved.
We found ourselves at the weekend at Kenmore on the River Tay to mark
the end of the salmon fishing season. After a hard day's angling on the
beat belonging to the Kenmore Hotel, the fishermen gather as darkness
falls by the riverside.
The ceremony is preceded by a loud and colourful fireworks display.
The local megalopolis of Aberfeldy boasts amongst its tradesmen a
pyrotechnician. Normally, he has to travel the length and breadth of
Britain to ply his pyrotechnical trade, but on the last night of the
salmon fishing he gets to perform on his own beat.
Led by a solitary piper, the fishermen and gathered populace make a
torchlit procession through the tiny and picturesque hamlet of Kenmore.
There is the school of thought that this ceremony of fire and water is
evocative of our Celtic, perhaps even Viking, past.
There is the other school of thought which points out that the ancient
tradition of saying farewell to the salmon season is all of three years
old. It was invented by Tennents, the brewers, who have allied
themselves with salmon-fishing on the Tay and have a keen eye for a
party.
As is so often the case when an angling beano is organised, the fish
vote with their fins and refuse to take part. Only two salmon were
landed by the crew of dedicated chaps and ladies with rods on the
Kenmore beat.
We had a chance to try the rod, but decided to leave the non-catching
to more able souls such as Paul Young, the TV angler. We must confess to
a fear of live, wriggling fish and were content to encounter our salmon
on a plate, smoked in the Kenmore style and lined with a Scottish
wholegrain mustard sauce.
Anyway, the salmon heading up the silvery Tay were at the end of a
long journey from Greenland where they had been stuffing themselves with
squid, prawns, and other seafood before answering nature's call to head
back to Scotland to spawn in their native burns.
Imagine how you would feel if you had swum 300 miles or so in pursuit
of some serious mating only to be howked out of the water a a few
hundreds yards short of your trysting spot.
It is a sad fate for the fish with the hook in its mouth and, without
wishing to over-anthropomorphise the situation, bad news for the other
salmon who would have been involved in the mating situation.
A leading salmon-fishing expert became almost lyrical in describing
the fishy fidelity that can be found on the spawning run.
He recalled catching a salmon and reeling it in, to find the mate
pathetically circling his boat. Faced with this display of true love and
devotion, was he so touched that he let the first fish go? No, he got
his gaff, skewered the mate, and hauled it into the boat as well.
Watching people not catching fish in the pine-scented air of the banks
of the Tay on a glorious sunny autumn day is thoroughly to be
recommended as an alternative to watching Partick Thistle not scoring
goals from the less-scented banks of Firhill. Or you could even have a
go at the fishing yourself.
It has a reputation for being a rich man's sport, but we are assured
that a day on the Kenmore beat may be had for as little as #20, less
than a European football match at Ibrox and less than a day's golf at a
decent course.
The salmon-fishing can get a grip on a person. A young doctor who was
part of a group up from Yorkshire to participate in the last day of the
season, became quite emotional.
Towards midnight, he remarked that he was just popping out from the
Kenmore Hotel to stand on the nearby bridge where the river joins Loch
Tay. He was going to ponder awhile on fishing and the meaning of life.
And honestly it wasn't just the whisky he had consumed at the ceilidh
that was talking.

EDINBURGH is an awffy place to go to -- but it was nothing of a
journey as that which the wee Russian boys of Moscow S.A. had to make.
It wasn't just a journey in time, it was a trip to another continent for
them.
The little boys of the under-12 team from Moscow came to Scotland with
little funding, and practically no equipment. Props which an average
Scottish child would take for granted -- trackies, trainies, designer
shirts -- were missing from the Moscow luggage.
Moscow Soccer Academy is a specialist school in which little ones are
coached and trained in the soccer skills. But the collapse of the Soviet
Union meant that the boys were barely financed. They had no shinpads
with them, and most came with baseball boots, and not football boots.
But the local Edinburgh parents who took in the Moscow lads as part of
the tournament, rallied round. I am proud of my own people that many
parents purchased the wee Russkies boots and shinpads and fed and
watered the wee maestros.
The boys had talent enough to make you greet. Sure Moscow S.A. lost by
five-nil to Edinburgh Schools on Friday, and two-one to Danish side
Aalborg on Saturday and six-nil to the West Lothians School's side
yesterday, but there was a reason for that. Moscow are all eleven or
below, and the other teams were under-fourteens.
The difference in size was almost bizarre. The difference in talent
was similar. I am not decrying the fine young lads who represented the
other teams for a lot of talent was on display, but, frankly, the little
Russian boys' abilities took everybody's breath away.
And also their inherent discipline, sportsmanship, and professional,
and good-natured, approach to matches they could not possibly win.
(Though they damn-near did on Saturday when they were one up until the
last five minutes with Aalborg's skipper, young Marten Petersen, scoring
two solo efforts.
A pity really, and even the Danish team admitted it because Moscow's
diminutive Louri Skorsov scored a goal in the fourth minute which had
you thinking of Jinky.
There was no doubt about the stars of the tournament. Every Muscovite
lad was a twinkling one, but I nominate the wee, wee, boy from the
Russias, Evgueni Illichev. This child was moving about with the ball
like Puskas and Pele rolled into one.
All the Russian lads had an ability to control, to hold the ball, to
look at the wider game. If this is Russian coaching at their age, Russia
is going to show the Brazilians in a few years time, believe me.
Coaching is different from training. ''We often over-train our
youngsters'' said Craig McLachlan, a drama teacher in Bellshill, and
coach for the West Lothian team, ''but what we've seen of the Moscow
lads gives the lie to the notion that coaching doesn't work.
''These kids started at six years of age in their school, and you
can't tell potential at that age -- it simply means that if you give the
right coaching you get a quality which is in the child himself.'' I
agree with that.
But let me not detract from some of the home-grown players at this
International Youth Games in Edinburgh, (there was also athletics,
badminton, basketball, hockey, and swimming and I commend both girls and
boys basketball teams from Munich and Aalborg for some wonderful
touches) for I saw some splendid work among the Edinburgh and Lothian
lads.
Paul Donaghue of Gracemount, impressed, as did Keegan and Cunningham
of West Lothian. And a goal which could win Scottish telly's monthly
competition was the drive into the top of the net against brave wee
Muscovite goalie Serguie Kouriatov, who seconds before, had a splendid
save from Cunningham. Gareth Williams' score had us breathless. I had
lots of time to recover though. Try a Sunday train from Edinburgh.

A message from THE RT HON MICHAEL FORSYTH MP, Secretary of State for
Scotland
YOU are stranded. At night. On the wrong side of a fairly sizeable
stretch of water. To cap it all you have #20,000 worth of fish in your
lorry. Scottish salmon that is due for an appointment on a continental
dinner plate before long. Try explaining that one to the boss in the
morning.
This may sound like the worst nightmare of a long-distance lorry
driver. It's certainly bad news for the country's economy. Luckily, this
particular story has a happy ending, since it took place when the
Kyle-Kyleakin ferry broke down a few weeks ago. Both driver and salmon
were able to be given a special escort across the new bridge and I trust
that the French are already enjoying the benefits of Scotland's newest
crossing!
I am privileged to be opening the Skye Bridge today. To those of us
who care deeply about the vitality of Scotland, it is a symbol of what
we can hope for in the future. I strongly believe that it will boost the
economy of Skye and the surrounding area. Above all, it is going to be
good for tourism, and that is good for all of us. The remoteness and
wildness of much of Scotland has always been a magnet to visitors but it
is hard to get enthusiastic about waiting in a long ferry queue.
I want to make the point that there is more to our vision than tourism
alone. We are committed to improving the transport and communications of
outlying areas. This is a country with one of the lowest population
densities in Western Europe. Of course people care deeply about being
able to keep in touch with the rest of the nation. Often, their lives
and their livelihoods depend upon it. By supporting the Skye bridge
project and including the A87 through Skye in the trunk road network,
the Government is making this commitment real.
You may have thought that the notion of a bridge to Skye is a new one.
Far from it. The initial suggestion of a fixed crossing came from the
islanders themselves and the first investigations were carried out in
1938. In later years it was the commitment of Highland Regional Council
to the vision of a crossing that helped to make it a reality.
It has taken us some time to get to where we are today. We were up
against the problems of competing projects and limited resources. Having
decided that a bridge was necessary for the island, it was frustrating
to be unable to find the money to build it.
What unlocked the door were the new ideas associated with the Private
Finance Initiative. Announced by the Chancellor in 1992, the PFI allows
us to present our projects as investment opportunities. In fact the
Government was already developing ways of doing this. Since 1991, new
legislation had made it possible for the private sector to propose and
carry out privately-funded schemes. We were already benefiting from the
introduction of private sector disciplines.
This in itself was a significant step forward. What really releases
the potential of the PFI, however, is the access it gives us to private
sector resources and world markets. It allows projects to go ahead which
might not otherwise be affordable.
The contract for the Skye Bridge is the first scheme in the UK to be
taken forward under the 1991 New Roads and Street Works Act. That is an
exciting ''first'' for Scotland. We are leading the way in making what
seems impossible, possible.
I am really delighted to be invited to open the bridge. It would have
been very pleasing to have been able to open a bridge which was
toll-free. However, if I waited until then I would have had to be pushed
to the Kyle in my bath-chair. It is simply an unrealistic proposition in
the current financial climate.
Despite its support for the project, Highland Regional Council could
not take on such a massive commitment without severely affecting other
priorities. The Scottish Office trunk road programme was already
over-subscribed.
The alternative was for a private company to design, build and finance
the scheme, recovering their costs through tolls. Had it not been for
this, there could have been no bridge for at least 20 years. As it is,
the bridge will be toll-free when the concession period ends, probably
in about 14 to 18 years' time.
Until then, islanders and visitors alike will reap all the benefits of
a road crossing while paying no more than they did for the ferry
service.
These benefits are not just a matter of quicker and more reliable
crossings. Highland Regional Council have taken the opportunity to carry
out significant improvements to the harbour and road in Kyleakin. New
footpaths and lighting have been provided to the A87 through Kyle.
Excess rock resulting from the building work will go to extend car
parking facilities at Eilean Donan Castle. More is earmarked for
Highland Regional Council's planned redevelopment of the ferry area at
Kyle. The Government itself has expressed its commitment through funding
of the bridge approach roads at a cost in the region of #9m.
The removal of long queues at Kyle and Kyleakin, particularly in the
summer months, will unlock opportunities for redevelopment. Both
villages have the potential to become tourist destinations in their own
right.
Together with the rest of Skye and the Kyle peninsula, these areas
will continue to be places of pilgrimage for visitors from all over the
world.
This is an example of what can be realised when the public and private
sectors work in partnership. This is the real test of the Private
Finance Initiative. For several years we have been talking of what we
hoped to achieve; our actions speak even louder than our words. A vital
piece of infrastructure is now in place years before the public sector
could have put it there. I hope it may be the first of many such
projects in Scotland.
To those of you who live on Skye and the Kyle peninsula, I
congratulate you on your new acquisition. To the rest of you, don't
simply take my word for it. Make a date to go and judge this spendid
achievement for yourselves. And to all the Parisians who enjoy a plate
of Scottish salmon, I am glad to tell you that in the future its place
on the menu is more confidently assured.

LAS VEGAS INVITATIONAL
SECOND-YEAR US Tour member Jim Furyk birdied the fifteenth and
sixteenth holes to set up his first Tour victory at the $1.5m event
yesterday.
Furyk led into the final round last year before fading to finish
fifth, but he did not succumb yesterday as he shot a closing
five-under-par 67 on the Summerlin TPC course. He finished at 28-under
331, one stroke ahead of fellow American Billy Mayfair (68), who birdied
the final hole.
Furyk, 25, collects $270,000, more than doubling his season earnings.
He started the final round tied for the lead with Mayfair, and never
fell behind with a round that inluded just one bogey.
Furyk eagled the par-5 ninth to open a two-shot lead, but Mayfair
fought back with two birdies to draw level with four holes left.
However, as Furyk regained control with his two birdies.He recorded
regulation pars at the final two holes, and Mayfair's final hole birdie
was too little too late.
American Kirk Triplett continued an impressive streak when he
completed his twenty-sixth successive round of par or better. ''I really
wasn't aware I hadn't shot over par since when?'' asked Triplett,
unaware of his run.
''Every Sunday the last couple of months I've had a chance to win. I'm
still waiting for my turn.'' Final scores (US unless stated):
331 -- Jim Furyk 67, 65, 65, 67, 67.
332 -- Billy Mayfair 66, 65, 67, 66, 68.
334 -- Scott McCarron 71, 65, 69, 64, 65.
335 -- Brad Bryant 65, 68, 67, 69, 66; Phil Blackmar 69, 66, 71, 64,
65; Mark O'Meara 67, 67, 66, 65, 70.
336 -- Glen Day 70, 67, 65, 68, 66; Davis Love 67, 67, 68, 67, 67;
David Edwards 67, 66, 64, 69, 70.
Other notables: 337 -- Kirk Triplett 66, 67, 69, 68, 67. 338 -- John
Cook 67, 64, 69, 67, 71. 343 -- Phil Mickelson 71, 65, 70, 69, 68.   344

MOST of those attending today's opening will be aware of the
long-running controversy over the toll regime the new bridge will
impose, but doubtless many will be unaware that, according to legend,
the imposition of tolls is nothing new to the Kyle of Lochalsh.
If you look over to Kyleakin, just south of the ferry slipway you will
see the ruins of Caisteal Maol, the blunt castle which was built as a
stronghold of the Clan MacKinnon. The castle, or another on the site,
was previously known as Dunakin, after the King of Norway.
Tradition holds that in this castle there once lived a Norwegian
Princess who was married to a MacKinnon chief. She was called Saucy Mary
and was said to have developed a nice little earner by use of a giant
chain stretched across from the mainland and anchored to rocks on the
Skye shore not far from where the bridge now touches down.
The princess and her chain stopped all ships sailing by, and they had
to pay a toll before they could proceed. Only ships from her native
Norway were allowed to pass free.
It said that such was her attachment to her own country that she asked
to be buried on the top of Beinn na Caillaich (Mountain of the Old
Woman), which rises above Broadford, so that winds from her homeland
could pass over her resting place.
Some cast doubts on the whole tale, though there is supposed to be a
Norwegian princess buried on the hill. In their book The Medieval
Castles of Skye and Lochalsh, R Micket and D L Roberts conclude:
''While the fabulous quality of such traditions might cause a raised
eyebrow, the circumstances which made them credible to an earlier age
are not so easily dismissed. Before the later medieval castle was built,
some early remains may have been visible around which the Saucy Mary
legend was fabricated.''
One thing not in doubt is that these were important lands for the
Norse. In fact, had the today's crowds turned up 732 years earlier, they
would not have seen a bridge but rather the great fleet of King Haakon
(or Haco). On July 15, 1263, he sailed from Bergen with 120 ships to try
and quell rebellion in his Scottish lands.
The fleet moored at Kyleakin (Haakan's Strait), where it waited to be
joined by the Norse barons of the isles and Gaelic princes. The joint
force made its way south, only to be defeated at Largs by Alexander III
of Scotland, bringing to an end Norse sway over the islands.
The first recorded arrival of the Norse in the Hebrides was in 794
and, according to the early Irish records, Skye was devastated from one
end to another, as it would be over and over again in the following
decades.
By 875, however, the Norsemen were coming as immigrants rather than
invaders, mingling with indigenous population. They were fleeing from
events at home which had seen Harald the Fair-Haired established as
supreme ruler, abolishing the old system of land ownership under which
people held the land they worked without service to any superior.
Some of these Norse immigrants were to use the Scottish islands as
their base for summer raiding in their former homeland.
This was all pretty modern stuff as far as Skye is concerned. After
all, it would appear there is no castle in the British Isles older in
legend than Dun Sgathaich in Sleat. It features in the Red Branch cycle
of Celtic tales, which is supposed to go back to the first century AD.
Cu-Chulainn, the great hero of the Red Branch cycle, came over from
Ireland to the castle to learn feats of arms from the Warrior Queen,
Sgathach - in particular the Gath-bolg, a special sword thrust to the
belly. He found time to defeat the Sleat Iomain (shinty) team
single-handed, and to help Sgathach against the other warrior queen,
Aoifa, thought also to have been living in Skye at the time.
Not only does Cu-Chulainn defeat Aoifa, he proceeds to have a son by
her, only to go back to Ulster. Before going, however, he leaves with
Aoifa a secret sign to prove that their child, Conlaoch, is his son.
As a young man, Conlaoch goes over to Ireland under a spell cast by
his mother, who is seeking revenge for having been left a single parent,
with orders to challenge all the heroes of Ulster, but not to reveal who
he is.
He defeats all the heroes who accept the challenge, so they send to
Dundalk for Cu-Chulainn, who unwittingly kills his son - by employing
the Gath-bolg. Before Conlaoch dies, Cu-Chulainn finds the sign on his
body, whereupon the distraught father goes mad and fights against the
sea. This was, however, only a temporary lapse, and Cu-Chulainn recovers
his sanity and goes about his heroic way.
Despite his legendary association with Skye, it appears certain that
the great Skye hills, the Cuillins, are not named after Cu-Chulainn. It
is most probable that the name comes from the Norse for an upturned
boat, because from the northwest the mountains closely resembles one and
that is the aspect the Norsemen would have first seen. It is likely that
they have the same linguistic root as the Kiolen Mountains in Norway,
the word for keel.
The name of the island itself is of older origin, according to
Alexander Nicolson in his History of Skye. ''One of the first to mention
the island was Ptolemy of Alexandria, who flourished in the year 120 AD.
He included Skye in his famous map, but placed it between Caithness and
Norway, and called it Sketies.
''Stray references to the island are found in the works of the Irish
monks, as the statement in the Annals of Ulster to the effect that the
people of Skye paid tribute to Badeun, son of Carril, who died in 581.''
The word Skye seems to mean the winged isle, and the island is cut or
split by great sea lochs, especially the wings of Loch Snizort and Loch
Dunvegan.

ISLE OF MULL RALLY
NEIL MacKinnon and Mike Stayte scored a historic seventh win on the
twenty-sixth Philips Tour of Mull Rally, Britain's longest and toughest
clubman rally, run over 180 miles of closed public roads.
Initially three local crews led the 149 car entry, with 19-year-old
Calum Duffy taking an initial lead on Friday night over veteran
MacKinnon. Sadly, Duffy's charge came to grief on Saturday afternoon
when his clutch failed, then third placed Eddie O'Donnell dropped to
fifteenth when he hit a rock and damaged his car's steering.
Just when MacKinnon took his customary position at the front, a rare
mistake saw him slip off the road. It took an agonsing five minutes and
plenty of spectator power to extricate the car from soggy ground and he
found himself fourth place behind the new leaders, Yorkshire's Billy
Bird and Plug Pulleyn.
After 19 of the 21 special stages, MacKinnon was back up to second
place, just five seconds behind the leader, and then it started to rain!
MacKinnon caught the leader on the 23 mile penultimate stage in the
early hours of Sunday morning but Bird himself put the result beyond
doubt when he spun on the stage.
Michael Shiel put in a late charge to snatch third place from Richard
Thompson with Edinburgh's Gordon Boyd fifth. Results:
1, Neil MacKinnon/Mike Stayte (Ford Escort Cosworth) 2 hours 57
minutes 56 seconds; 2, Billy Bird/Plug Pulleyn (Vauxhall Astra) 2:59:09;
3, Michael Shiel/Graham Shiel (Vauxhall Astra) 2:59:29; 4, Richard
Thompson/Reg Smith (Nissan Sunny) 3:02:17; 5, Gordon Boyd/Stella Boyles
(Ford Escort Cosworth) 3:02:31; 6, Eddie O'Donnell/Eddie O'Donnell (Ford
Escort RS) 3:04:38; 7, Derek Carless/Pete Forrester (Ford Escort)
3:06:33; 8, Donald Brown/Fred McLean (Talbot Sunbeam) 3:10:52; 9, Mark
Jasper/Guy Foster (Ford Sierra Cosworth) 3:10:58; 10, Stuart
McQueen/Alistair Green (Vauxhall Astra) 3:11:05.

'To outlaw boxing would immediately drive it underground where it
would be impossible to control'
IT is difficult, even for someone with a deep love for the sport and
an unbounded respect for most of those connected with it, to defend
boxing at this time. The tragic death of Jim Murray has left us all
feeling somewhat numb with shock.
However, it is easy for those who constantly call for the sport to be
banned, including the British Medical Association, to trot out all their
old arguments and add statistics to strengthen their case. The fact is
that boxing will and should remain as a licensed sport under strict
control.
Death, or the possibility of being killed every time they enter a ring
is something of which every professional boxer is very much aware.
Boxing is a dangerous sport -- but nowhere near the top of the league --
but those who control the sport in this country recognise that fact and
act accordingly.
There are strict medical examinations to be gone through before a
licence is granted, thorough checks both before and after a contest, and
regular brain scans. Down the years championship matches have been
reduced in length to the present day 12 rounds. In the amateur game
headguards are now compulsory and there is a lobby for the introduction
of guards in professionalism. In my opinion headguards do not do a lot
of good, but that is another argument.
The British Boxing Board of Control is constantly seeking ways to
ensure that the sport is made even safer, and the medical assistance
available to the participants during a performance cannot be bettered by
any other game.
To outlaw boxing would immediately drive it underground where it would
be impossible to control. Let those who call for a ban be under no
illusions. If it is outlawed it will not go away. Rather, we will hear
of unfit men, urged on by unscrupulous handlers, fighting in squalid
conditions, without any medical attention whatsoever.
Nobody forces anyone into boxing. Yet just go round the various gyms
in your area this week and you will see hundreds of kids with ambitions
of reaching the pinnacle. Would anyone dare say, for example, that
boxing has been bad for Jim Watt? The man, who brought the world
lightweight title back to Scotland more than a decade ago, is an
intelligent, articulate fellow who was and is an outstanding ambassador
for the sport. He was good for boxing and boxing was good for him. There
are hundreds more like Watt around Britain.
Terry Lawless, the Londoner who guided Watt to that world title,
contacted me yesterday in the aftermath of the Jim Murray tragedy. ''It
is difficult to defend boxing at a time like this,'' he said. ''But look
at all these kids who flock to the gyms. What would a lot of these kids
be without boxing? Dangerous hooligans, turning to crime and violence on
the streets.''
Anyway, if boxing was banned in Britain, those who didn't join the
''underground'' would simply go elsewhere to pursue their chosen
profession.
When those who call for the abolition of boxing call for a similar ban
on mountain climbing, pot holing, motor racing etc, maybe I will take
more time to listen to them.

THIS has been an impossible time for those of us whose consciences go
into tumble-drier mode when we try to defend boxing, try to explain why
we like it, and try to justify its existence. Its morality as a sport
becomes all the more indefensible when young men like James Murray,
immensely fit young men like James Murray, are carried off to their
death while drunken hooligans parade their mindlessness on the back of
his sacrifice.
There can have been few more degrading spectacles than was witnessed
in the name of sport at the Hospitality Inn (the hotel chain will not be
gratified at the irony of its name in the tragic circumstances) last
Friday and there will certainly be people who will make sure it is the
last boxing show they ever attend. More importantly, how much longer can
the sport as a whole continue to trot out the old weary defiances, some
of which I confess to have offered in mitigation myself?
It seems to me that the statistics which claim that rugby is more
dangerous, that mountain climbing is far more life threatening, and that
crossing the road offers greater risk will have to be committed to the
'Just Fancy That?' columns. The number of professional boxers suffering
death or very serious injury in recent years is too high to be swept
aside by such facile debating points.
Much more thought and work has to be done if the boxing business is to
survive, if it is entitled to survive. That is the first and most
awkward sticking point. Some people might suggest that, in a society
which sends a footballer to jail as a consequence of a minor act of
violence, it is inexplicable that it permits assault, albeit with gloves
on, as a legitimate sporting spectacle.
None of the hackneyed old responses to the ban-the-fight movement,
that boxing helps kids from poor backgrounds to lifestyles they could
never achieve, that it encourages discipline and supreme fitness, that
it can be an art when displayed by the most brilliant, et al, stands up
against that inescapable logic. Only the fact that banning it would
encourage underground versions of the sport, without the meticulous
attempts at safeguarding the fighters which the official boards
sanction, without the prevention of punch-drunk, unwell or potentially
suicidal fighters taking part in seedy parodies of the real thing.
Maybe even that is a flawed argument. Maybe if it was outlawed, boxing
would gradually disappear altogether as young men found less damaging
ways of emerging from the poverty zones of civilised society. Maybe, but
I think not. Already, there is an alternative circuit where bruisers
with big bodies and hard faces earn their beer money for fighting until
they drop, literally, and if you imagine the promoters of these
unofficial bouts would not blossom in the twilight zone of a boxing-free
society then you are blessed with a naivety that should not be
disturbed.
It has to go on, then, but why do we like it? There is very little to
say in our defence. There is an excitement, an awesome thrill at the
sight of phenomenal boxing skills and ferocious fighting strength, a
contest between astonishingly fit athletes. The very best doing their
very best, like Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard, and Sugar Ray Robinson, can
instil an admiration that goes beyond the brutalities that are inherent
in the sport itself.
It is not the virtuosity of them or people like them, however, that
will save the sport in the long run. It will ony be the conviction that
things would get worse if it was outlawed. In the meantime the point has
surely been reached when headguards are compulsory. Fighters don't like
them, they don't give complete protection . . . we have heard it all
before. The fact is they use them in sparring to prevent injury. The
case rests there.
Whatever is done, whatever happens now or in the future, nothing
anybody can ever do will erase the memory of that young man being lifted
away from the ring while madmen fought their own pathetic battles. God
help us all.

THE wheels finally came off Inveraray's challenge in the national
premier league when the young Argyll side suffered their first defeat of
the campaign in Glasgow. Mid Argyll netted twice in the first 20 minutes
through Iain MacNaughton and Ernie Crawford to cause the upset of the
day. Mid Argyll now join Inveraray in joint third spot, with Kingussie
three points ahead of the pack.
With the league reaching the halfway stage this weekend, Kingussie's
advantage could be crucial. They maintained their winning sequence, the
only unbeaten record left in the top flight, with a commanding 7-3
victory at home to Newtonmore.
The visitors were never really in the hunt, although they doubled
their goal tally for the season, against the aspiring champions.
Fort William moved into second spot with a comfortable 5-1 home win
against Glenurquhart, whose form has slumped badly in the last
fortnight.
Oban Camanachd, too, were among the goals, although Oban Celtic took
the lead before going down 4-1. Camanachd's Dave McCuish scored all of
the home team's goals.
Caberfeidh and Beauly shared the league points in north division one,
but Cabers secured the national Mod trophy, winning a penalty shoot-out
3-1 at Brora.
The north division one race continues to be a tight affair with the
top six sides all unbeaten and among the goals. Skye were the best
performers on the day with Willie MacRae getting four in the 7-3 home
win over Strathglass.
In the south, Kyles once again found themselves on easy street with an
8-1 victory over second-placed Glenorchy.

Performance
SO here we are again. The lads -- Pants Performance Association -- are
back onstage, ferreting after concepts that will explain life, choice,
freedom and democracy. Only, we're not exactly here again . . . because
the lads are hankering after something other than beer, football,
clubbing, brawling -- the usual boys games they've used so brilliantly
in the past -- to explain why democracy feels like an invisible
straightjacket and freedom ends up as just another set of rules decided
by a committee who rarely agreed.
Gag starts off with just such a committee. All five men sit at a
table, trying to work out a running order for the show. Suggestion after
suggestion is knocked back with an unexplained 'Objection!' It's hard to
know how much of this is already determined, how much is genuinely
random -- either way eight scenes are listed and eight scenes are played
out in a bizarre collage of rituals, confrontations, personal anecdote
and intellectual gambit.
Images of control -- external and self-imposed -- percolate through
sequences like Hypnotape with its calming imperative ''relax'' or
Achey-Breaky Heart, where the synchronised dance is made up of yoga
stretches and balances. There's an air of studded calm, detachment even,
as if the slightest hint of a free-for-all would threaten the
(supposedly) democratic status quo. Some elements -- like The Play, a
lengthy series of unidentified intros from Chekhov, Priestley, Rattigan,
Ibsen and others -- really presume on the audience's patience, but the
company's sense of the ridiculous and the absurd, at its best when
taping abusive messages over each others mouths -- the Gag of the title
-- rekindles interest in a piece that is more subdued than previous
works, but just as intellectually off-the-wall in its ideas.

Theatre
THERE'S a small sign on the Town Hall door announcing that this
evening's play has been transferred to the High School. It doesn't
bother giving directions. This is the Borders Festival and people just
know. Getting on for 350 are already in their seats when I arrive 15
minutes before start time.
And Ann Coburn's new play is very much their story. A companion piece
to Stephen Greenhorn's Salt Wound, it's a portrait of the life of an
east coast fishing community, a people both dependent on and at the
mercy of the sea. Saturday's premiere by Fourth Wall Productions marked
the anniversary of Black Friday, the day in 1881 when a freak storm took
the lives of 189 Borders fishermen -- 129 of them from Eyemouth alone --
leaving behind almost 100 widows and more than 200 fatherless children.
The event is the focus of Coburn's play and she's wise enough to let
the plain emotional power of the facts work for themselves. It's a
straightforward, uncomplicated, even old-fashioned piece, the more so
under Laurence Payne's unobtrusive direction, but it's driven by a
sincerity and honesty that you can only admire. I can't recall being in
an audience so still and concentrated.
Built around three women left ashore while their menfolk brave the
seas, it is performed with verve and commitment by Lyndsey Maples, Wendy
Summers and Alison Coates who, despite the tumultuous events outside the
single-room set, are the play's real action and motivating spirit. Their
centrepiece speeches after the storm sparkle with simple conviction,
helping to create a moving and invigorating drama that is never
overwhelmed by the grim force of real events.

REACTION within the sport to the death of James Murray indicated a
willingness to listen and learn.
Boxing Board secretary John Morris said: ''Everybody involved in
British boxing and really in world boxing will be deeply saddened over
this news and feeling for Murray's family and all his friends in
Glasgow.
''James was a talented and extremely brave young boxer who perhaps
came within a very short distance of becoming a British champion.
''Obviously, we shall now have to wait for the medical reports and the
Board's medical people. Everybody associated in British boxing will join
the board in taking stock.
''I've spent the weekend with consultants and senior medical advisers
and, if the doctors recommend any immediate measures, they will be
adopted.
''We are arranging a date for the inquiry over the crowd disturbances
and that will be announced within the next few days. As always, boxing
people are rallying behind their sport.''
Frank Warren, the fight co-promoter, said: ''Obviously, I'm very upset
at what happened and my thoughts, like everyone, are with the Murray
family. It is a very difficult and tragic time for them and for Drew
Docherty who is also going through quite a bit of pain at the moment.
''These tragedies always seem to happen in title fights. There's far
more title fights going on than there were before, but that's really an
observation, I don't know whether that is statistically correct or not.
''We've got to try and learn some lessons from what has happened. It's
a sport with a health warning and if anyone is an any doubt they should
try to make an appointment with their doctor to find out about the
implication of getting involved and what might happen to them.
''Tragedies happen very rarely, certainly in this country -- eight
deaths in 50 years I believe. There have been two in the last 18 months
here and it's at times like this that it is very hard to justify boxing,
or indeed deaths in any sport.
''We certainly need a lot of help from the Government concerning the
hooliganism. We need for them to do to these people coming to boxing
shows exactly what they did to the soccer people who were doing it.''
The Boxing Board intensified their medical precautions after the brain
injuries received by Michael Watson in his fight against Chris Eubank at
White Hart Lane in 1991, such as the recruitment of paramedics and,
where possible, the placement of an anaesthetist. Before then, British
measures were already considered among the most thorough in world
boxing.
Certainly, the Board's swift action in transporting Gerald McClellan
to hospital after he was knocked down for a second time by Nigel Benn in
February was crucial, but they are sure to explore other ways to improve
their measures even further.
They recently fell into line with world title boxing and brought
weigh-ins forward to 24 hours before the event to reduce the dangers of
dehydration, a condition which makes fighters more prone to serious
injury. Previous safety suggestions have included the reduction of
rounds and their length, re-designed gloves, and increasing the
one-minute break between rounds.
The board have invited former world featherweight champion Barry
McGuigan, president of the boxer's union the PBA, to sit in on their
next meeting on November 1.
McGuigan said: ''This is devastating and my sympathy goes out to the
Murray family. We will get the anti-boxing brigade jumping up and down
again. But tragedies will happen from time to time in any sport. We have
to make sure boxing is made as safe as possible.''
Nicky Piper, the Commonwealth light-heavyweight champion and PBA
chairman, added: ''It's hard to defend a brutal sport when the aim is to
hurt an opponent. But the fact is it's still safer than many other
sports. Boxing will never go under as long as two people want to fight
and people want to watch them.''
Jim McDonnell, the former European featherweight champion who was
stretchered out of the ring after a knockout by American Kenny Vice at
the Royal Albert Hall, said: ''I knew of the dangers and I'm sure James
Murray did. We are all grown up and know the risk.''

DUNOON Jazz Festival's rise from a novelty greeted with a disbelieving
smile to an annual, eagerly awaited event has been swift and this year's
programme has confirmed its serious stature on the UK jazz calendar.
Saturday evening's main attractions focused on the Queen's Hall, where
first clarinettist Buddy DeFranco and vibraphonist Terry Gibbs gave us
the full benefit of their close-on 120 years experience as itinerant
jazz musicians.
Supported by the splendid David Milligan (piano) with Ronnie Rae
(bass) and Tony McLennan (drums), DeFranco and Gibbs paid expected
tribute to Benny Goodman on several King of Swing favourites including
an Airmail Special marked ''Urgent''. DeFranco's tone is gorgeous and
his sense of invention on tunes he must have played thousands of times
was indeed special. His ballad feature of Leonard Bernstein's I'm So
Lucky to be Me was both flawless and emotionally engaging, while Gibbs,
generally a much more flamboyant player, brought elegant chiming vigour
to What's New.
A festival needs to introduce new as well as established names and
a brief taste of Haftor Medboe's clear, polished guitar playing
alongside flugelhornist Eddie Severn marked the Norwegian as someone to
catch at greater length next time.
Back at the Queen's Hall pianist Julian Joseph justified his man of
the moment status with a set that nodded towards his Caribbean roots and
respect for jazz ballad alike. Although prone to long-windedness and
over fond of sustained repetition for effect, Joseph's trio is one of
the most dynamically varied and exciting piano trios I've ever heard,
with drummer Mark Mondesir almost brutal behind Joseph's athletic
finesse on the exhilarating Firehorse.

STEPHEN Pastel informs a crowded King Tut's, ''This is a pro show''.
Of course the joke's on U2, because one thing the Pastels are not known
for is big bucks slickness. (It's quite usual for songs to be stopped
midway because someone forgets the chords, as happened on Friday night).
The laid back, unrehearsed atmosphere of their shows is often
misinterpreted as laziness or carelessness, but in fact, the Pastels
just know how to have fun and, more importantly, they know that beauty
is all the more startling when it comes out of chaos.
There can be no band in Scotland more suited to kicking off Glasgow's
Ten Day Weekend festival than the Pastels, because they have spent more
than 10 years celebrating and romanticisng the city as effectively as
any poet, playwright or novelist I know of. This show is an impassioned
display of the youthful exuberance, the warm optimism and the knock 'em
dead wit which characterises the best Pastels records.
Like all great music, the mechanics are both intangible and
unimportant -- the Pastels bypass the ego and go straight for the id: an
expressway to your heart.
After a tender and moving version of Thru Your Heart and the most
frenzied punk rock Truck Train Tractor I've seen them do, the Pastels
finish off with a head-banging, po-going cover of the Buzzcocks' ESP.
It's an exhilarating end to a whirlwind gig.

Keith Bruce meets two artists whose work looks at the shopping mall's
place in society
AS it colonises galleries across Scotland, it is not easy to miss
Fotofeis, Scotland's second international festival of photography and
related art. But it is the large scale public art installations that
will be seen by most people and Glasgow has one of the best in Trans
Action Public, a thoughtful but accessible show in the St Enoch Centre.
The fact that the images -- vast colour photographs printed on PVC
that comment in a straightforward (but not vacuous) fashion on the
nature of consumerism and the place of the shopping mall in Glasgow --
are there at all is a testimony to the faith of Fotofeis in the artists
and its policy of encouraging collaboration.
Glasgow's David Michael Clarke and Pierre Allard from Montreal had not
met before May of this year and were brought together under the auspices
of Glasgow's Breathe visual arts organisation and the artist-run Oboro
centre in Montreal. With no specific remit they were challenged to
produce work for Fotofeis and then entirely new work for Montreal in
January.
The relationship has clearly been a success. If nothing else, the two
young men share a gentle ironic sense of humour that is evident in the
work. Using a cast of attractive young people as models and the
Arlington baths as their studio, one set of pictures relates directly to
the purpose of their exhibition area.
Where the mall is designed to keep shoppers out of the elements, their
set is where people have long gone to get wet. Providing basic
sustenance, both physical and spiritual, is not really of interest to
the retailers in St Enoch, so Clarke and Allard's figures pose with
bread and candles.
Shot in a day using a large format camera the images were then
manipulated by computer before being printed by a specialist company in
Liverpool. Without support in kind from photographic companies and the
staff at St Enoch, the ambitious scale of the couple's work could not
have been realised.
Famously the centre has the largest glass roof in Europe, but Clarke
points out that it is still impossible to see either the sky or
Glasgow's skyline, so at either end of the mall they have brought the
city into the centre with long banners of St Mary's Cathedral on Great
Western Road, a chimney belonging to Distillers, a Maryhill tower block,
and the sky above Kelvingrove Park.
Black and white friezes at both entrances reflect the new and old
Glasgow -- quite literally at the BHS end, where clever shots of old
buildings reflected in new glass strucures are strung together. The
other frieze is derived from thoughts of the railway station which stood
on the site and includes the old clock, now a fixture in Cumbernauld's
shopping centre.
Beautifully realised and readily appreciable, Clarke and Allard's work
shows clear evidence that they chimed both in intention and philosophy.
''You have to respect the limitations of working in a public space:
art is language and communication and we wanted to create a stir, but
not World War Three,'' says Clarke. Allard is equally concerned that the
work speaks without offending: ''The link has been broken between art
and the public. It is very important to make something that people
understand.''

I LIKE boxers. I loathe boxing. From my earliest days as a young
reporter I wanted to interview the guys who gave their all in the ring
-- Jackie Brown, Dick McTaggart, 'Cowboy' McCormack, Ken Buchanan,
Walter McGowan, Chic Calderwood, Randolph Turpin, Terry Downes, and
Sugar Ray Robinson are just some of the men I have talked to and
admired.
They were colourful characters, larger than life, with hearts to
match. I have known promoters and trainers too -- Jack Solomons, the
Gilmours, father and son, whom I have liked. I do not subscribe to the
view that everyone connected with boxing is on the make.
Only last weekend I was sitting across the aircraft aisle from Henry
Cooper thinking, as I still do, what a tremendous contribution he has
made to the sporting life of this country. I was delighted when Frank
Bruno won his world title at last because he has given us all so much
fun along the way.
Jim Reynolds, our boxing writer, is a friend of mine. We were at the
Bruno-Lewis fight at the National Stadium in Cardiff together and I was
quite enjoying it until that moment when Frank was seriously hurt, his
face froze like a big iced ball, and he just didn't know what to do to
stop the blows coming. And all my old nausea returned.
It is not just that boxing kills. There are far more dangerous
occupations. Mountain climbing, an activity I cannot begin to
comprehend, claims more lives every year. So does Grand Prix racing.
But boxing degrades. You can believe that the bright, bubbly,
brilliant man who was once Cassius Clay and is now a mumbling wreck has
become so by just an accident of nature. No doctor does.
You can believe that two superbly fit men battering each other about
the head -- for years -- leaves absolutely no ill-effects. I cannot see
how any sane person could come to such a conclusion.
Strip away all the ''noble art of self-defence'' facade, the
''skill'', the ''courage'' -- both of which are much in evidence in a
ring -- and you are still left with a contest where one man is out to
inflict the maximum physical damage on another.
When Duncan Ferguson head-butted another footballer when he was on
probation he was sent to jail. Rightly.
When Scott McMillan, of Preston Lodge Rugby Club, smashed an
opponent's jaw and cheekbone he was sentenced to nine months. Rightly.
Yet we permit boxers, within the law, to hurt, maim, and sometimes
kill. And I actually believe, despite the best intentions of the boxing
authorities, that the dangers are increasing. Fighters are fitter, punch
harder, and cause more hurt.
Yes, I would ban it. Not just because of what happens in the ring but
also because of what happens outside it. If we are truthful, boxing
brings out the worst in spectators too, in us all. Just look at the
expressions on the watchers' faces, men and women, when a boxer hits the
canvas; just look in the mirror.
Would it go underground, would there be fights in the back-rooms of
pubs with no doctors or paramedics within a mile, would all fights be
held in some third-world country? Yes, each of these things could
happen, though the law would presumably be strictly enforced, here at
least.
We cannot stop young men risking their lives in some foreign ring if
that is what they are determined to do. But we can stop kidding
ourselves that this is a sport.
It is a mercenary business where a lot of people get rich, rarely the
fighters, and a lot of people get hurt, always the fighters.
Read the accounts of the end of the Drew Docherty-James Murray bout.
An exhausted young man, down on his hands and knees, finally keeled over
into a pool of his own blood, probably never to rise again. Meanwhile,
drunken fans threw bottles and chairs at the ring. This is sport in a
civilised country?
I think of those who will gain most from the projected Mike
Tyson-Bruno encounter, the hoods and the hustlers. Where will they be if
the loveable panto player has his brains scrambled? The prospect makes
my blood run cold.
Enough, I say. Enough.

TENNIS
SATURDAY'S match between the holders, Bridge of Allan Sports Club, and
last year's runners-up Newlands proved to be a fitting climax to the
premier division of the men's national league, with the Stirlingshire
side enjoying home advantage as they clinched victory by the narrowest
of margins.
The hosts, who entered the final fixture with a one-point advantage
over Newlands, established a 2-1 lead after the first round thanks to a
6-1, 6-2 win for national champion Ken Wood over Ian MacAulay and a 6-2,
6-2 success for Ben Saunders over Graham Reid, while Calum McKnight
opened the visitors' account when he beat Owen Hadden 6-7, 6-3, 6-2.
In the second round, former British No.4 Nick Fulwood confirmed his
class as he increased Bridge of Allan's lead to 3-1 with a 6-1, 6-3
victory over Newlands captain Malcolm Watt but the Scottish Cup winners
fought back to level the score when Ronnie Terras upset Scottish No.5
Jason Barnett 6-4, 6-1, and Leon Smith dismissed Craig Walker 6-3, 6-4.
Wood and Saunders teamed up to put the holders 4-3 ahead when they
beat Smith and MacAulay 6-2, 6-4 in the third-string doubles but Terras
and McKnight squared the match again with a 7-5, 6-3 win over Barnett
and Walker before Fulwood and Hadden completed a 6-4, 6-1 win over Watt
and Reid to clinch the trophy for Bridge of Allan for the third
successive year.
Broomhill, led by Liz Adams and Deirdre Forrest, won the women's
premier division for the first time when they trounced a depleted Cults
side 6-0 in Aberdeen to finish on 29 points, one ahead of defending
champions Broughty Ferry.

MEN'S HOCKEY
A LATE goal from Calum Wood took Grange from fourth place to top of
the first division of the national league on Saturday with a 3-2 away
win over Ciba Kelburne.
Gordon Moore, the Kelburne captain did more than anyone to keep his
side in the match, scoring both their goals, but there was little he
could do to prevent Grange from becoming the fifth team in five weeks to
hold down top spot.
Grange's cause was simplified considerably by the failure of Torbrex
Wanderers, Touche Ross Gordonians, and Western to pick up maximum
points, although the last named managed to hold on to second position.
They achieved this by salvaging a point in a 4-4 draw at Menzieshill,
although at half-time their prospects looked bleak as they trailed 3-1
after John Christie had converted two penalties. The Glasgow side opened
the scoring through Graham Joyce.
Chris Anderson and Kenny Stibbles were the other scorers for the
Dundee men with Western's second-half strikes coming from Stuart
McMorrow, Calum McLeod, and Steven Menzies.
MIM overcame a similar deficit at Gordonians to win only their second
game of the season. Gavin Markham was the architect of the triumph,
scoring the first and fourth goals.
Insights Inverleith also proved that an early reversal was no real
handicap as they came back to beat previous leaders Wanderers 3-2 in a
match in which centre back Kerr Thompson again proved his worth to the
team.
The Perth man not only kept Gordon Shepherd scoreless but showed the
Scotland striker how it was done with two goals before Ian Ward set up
the winner for Martin Pearson.

HONG KONG RALLY
A SPIN on the second special stage of yesterday's section relegated
Britain's Richard Burns to fourth place in the 555 Hong Kong-Beijing
Rally.
But Burns, who was third after the first day, and Subaru Impreza 555
team-mate Possum Bourne are continuing to put pressure on the rally
leader, Sweden's Kenneth Eriksson.
''There was a very slippery concrete section in the middle of a gravel
stage and I was caught out,'' explained Burns. ''Overall, I am
encouraged by the day. We are on the pace and the times will get quicker
as the rally moves north.''
Heavy overnight rain added to the already slippy, muddy conditions
and, although Burns caused no damage spinning his Impreza 555, it was
over two minutes before he could get going again.
There were no such problems for the rest of his team. ''Today has gone
well and I am very happy with our times which are picking up,'' said
Burns. ''I was determined to get some good rally miles under my belt and
now I'm back into the full swing of things. Basically we've been taking
it fairly steady all day.''
At the head of the event, the two Mitsubishi drivers, Eriksson and Ari
Vatanen, have been exchanging fastest times but Eriksson still holds a
21-second lead.
Of the 44 cars that left Hong Kong on Saturday, only 34 will start the
347-mile third leg to the city of Changsha today.
The grueling race, the fifth round of the 1995 Asia Pacific Rally
Championship, ends on Friday in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Positions
after day two:
1 K Eriksson (Sweden) Mitsubishi, 1hour 9minutes 17seconds; 2, A
Vatanen (Finland) Mitsubishi 1:9:38; 3, P Bourne (New Zealand) Subaru
1:10:54; 4, R Burns (Great Britain) Subaru 1:13:11; 5, Y Fujimoto

WOMEN'S HOCKEY
IN THE absence of Great Britain and Scotland strikers Susan MacDonald
and Rhona Simpson because of international commitments, Linda McKay, the
Hyndland centre forward, has been setting a hot pace in the goal-scoring
stakes.
McKay has now netted 14 goals in her past four games. Six of them came
when she scored four in the Glasgow club's 5-0 league defeat of
Menzieshill on Saturday and then yesterday she emulated her club
captain, Sharon Duncan, by hitting a double in their 6-0 victory over
Dumfries in the league cup.
McKay is occupying a position which once was the domain of Lynn
Forsyth.
The former Scotland player has taken a step back in order to play with
second-division Kelburne but she has not lost her scoring touch, as she
demonstrated by netting both goals in the 2-1 victory over Stepps.
Royal High Gymnasts also advanced. Two goals by captain Val Neil and
another by Mandy Channing helped see off Watsonians 3-0.
Melrose Croall Bryson are one of just two sides in the league with
their maximum record still intact. They carried that form over to the
cup, sending Grange home from the Borders at the end of a 7-2 defeat,
thanks to a hat trick by Elaina Lynn.
Highland, newcomers to the league this season, are the other side with
an unblemished record, but they fell at the first hurdle in the cup
going down 3-0 to first-division Menzieshill.
All their goals came in the first half, through Karen Smith (2) and
Kim Beattie.
The most prolific scorers were Grove's second string, who crushed
Central Wanderers 10-1 with Suzanne Fleming netting four of the goals.

Music/Visual Art
JUST as the NME photography exhibition at the Arches could easily have
been part of Fotofeis as a show for Glasgow's Ten Day Weekend, this
Fotofeis performance would have sat as easily in the city's music
festival -- such is the enthusiasm for cross-media collaborations in
these post-modern days.
The Moors are a trio of visual artists -- Malcolm Lindsay, Carol
Moore, and Stuart Duffin -- who have formed a band. Here they were
augmented by percussionist Eddie John and the keyboard ''soundscape'' of
Steve Butler, together with a string quartet from the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra. Further collaboration came in the shape of four more visual
artists -- computer imaging from Emma Candy and David Eaton, video from
Gerald Mair, and the photography of Melanie Sims.
A rich evening of interrelated work was promised and texturally that
was what we got. The combination of multilayered video on screen and
projected, Sims's dissolving photographs of hands, and Mair's rotating
heads was always interesting. Sometimes there was an obvious correlation
between the pictures and the music -- notably on Lewis, when the
standing stones of Callanish were both visible and lyrically noted --
but often not, and the strings were largely limited to their own
separate pieces (memorably the contrapuntal minimalism of Virtual
Movement).
The Moors are accomplished players from the widescreen Blue Nile
school, and both Lindsay's guitar playing and the bass of Duffin
supplied rhythmic interludes amid the lush. But the overall impression
was all texture and no tunes, and although Homelands and The Colour of
Ashes (also the title of Duffin's recent exhibition) come close, Moore's
accomplished singing needs more bite and passion -- and a glimpse of a
catchy hook.

ICE HOCKEY
CHRIS PALMER hit four goals to earn Fife Flyers a place in today's
Benson and Hedges Cup semi-final draw.
He was the hero as Flyers drew 5-5 at Newcastle Warriors to give them
an 11-10 aggregate victory over the Tynesiders in the two-leg
quarter-final.
Mark Morrison, last season's top marksman, set up all Palmer's goals
and Flyers walked a tightrope after a one-goal victory on their own ice
on Saturday.
Dumfries Vikings retained top spot in Division 1 with a 9-4 victory
over Chelmsford Chieftains thanks to doubles from John Churchill,
Stephen Lynch, and Dean Richards.
But Murrayfield Royals lost their fourteenth straight game in all
competitions when they went down 9-4 at Manchester Storm.
Meanwhile, Paisley Pirates will make a protest to British Ice Hockey
Association officials after their top marksman, Dainius Bauba, was taken
to hospital with serious injuries to his left knee.
Referee Drew Fraser and referee supervisor Tam Gillespie were both
cornered by Pirates' coach Martin Shields, who said: ''They said they
never saw the incident but it's not good enough. I've got one of my star
players in hospital.'' Results:

Morton 2 Hamilton 0
MORTON yesterday turned down a #300,000 bid for Derek McInnes from
Dundee United. But there must now be a major question over how long the
Greenock club will be able to hold on to their midfield maestro.
The signs last night were that United manager Billy Kirkwood will be
back to step up his offer.
Morton manager Allan McGraw confirmed: ''United have made an offer but
we have turned it down. We don't want to lose Derek.''
Leeds United and Bolton are among a number of clubs who have been at
recent games watching him.
McInnes held off re-signing during the close season but then accepted
a new contract at Morton when no-one came in for him. But he was again
in outstanding form as he spearheaded the Greenock side to three more
points on Saturday.
Said McGraw: ''He was magnificent. What more can I say about him.
''I'm happy that after last week's defeat we are back to winning and
collecting the points.
''It took us a little longer to settle and I reckon that was due to
nervousness but once we got the first goal, there was only going to be
one winner.''
The Greenock side had to wait until almost half an hour was gone
before Alan Mahood got that important opener with a superb 18-yard shot.
And it took an outstanding display by keeper Allan Ferguson to keep
the Greenock attack out. Three times, he defied Morton, but he had no
answer when Warren Hawke struck for a second in 59 minutes when he
headed in a Marko Rajamaki cross.
This defeat leaves hamilton isolated at the bottom, and a worried
manager, Iain Munro, admitted: ''We need major surgery. I have no
excuses. If we do not get the breaks, I believe we should make our own.
''I am paid to take the pressure of being in the present situation,
but everyone will have to look at themselves.''

Airdrie 1, Clydebank 1
IT was not the best of weeks for nomads Airdrie. Only days after their
latest application for a new stadium was turned down by the planning
authorities, they again found their temporary home at Broadwood an
inhospitable place as far as collecting points is concerned.
They had to settle for a draw despite creating more chances in a game
which did little to enthuse a crowd of only 1206.
Perfect playing conditions on a sunny afternoon failed to inspire
either side and a minute strike in 34 minutes by Airdrie's John Davies
and a headed equaliser from James Grady four minutes after the interval
were rare highlights.
There was some debate afterwards about the scorer of Clydebank's goal.
Airdrie's veteran keeper John Martin was convinced team-mate Jimmy Boyle
had put through his own goal. Referee Bill Crombie agreed.
But Grady said there was no doubt in his mind that his effort was well
over the line before anyone else touched it. Referee Crombie also seemed
to deny Airdrie a penalty when Peter Duffield was brought down by Tom
Currie.
All Airdrie were concerned about was that two points were dropped,
leaving them in a mid-table, having won only one league match at
Broadwood.
Manager Alex MacDonald said: ''It is annoying that we are still no
nearer having a ground of our own. It is time we had some communication
from councillors to see where we go from here.''
On the playing side MacDonald commented: ''We had more possession, and
it is disappointing that we could not take advantage.''
Bankies aim to be on the move themselves soon. Coach Brian Wright said
''There is no doubt we are making good progress on and off the field.
''This is a strong league and in my opinion is more competitive than
the premier division. We have lost only two of our nine games and they
were to Dunfermline and Dundee United.''

GOALS were the order of the day in Saturday's first round of the OVD
Junior Cup.
Benburb led their way with their 16-goal thrashing of Inverurie. Hat
tricks from Davie Greig and Neil Diamond set the Bens on their way.
Armadale made the long trip to Burghead and were rewarded with a 10-0
victory.
A Billy McCafferty treble and a double from Crichton and Donnachie
helped Arthurlie to a 9-0 win over Lossiemouth United.
Davie Flynn, the top goal scorer in last season's competition scored
twice in Camelon's comfortable 5-0 win over Glasgow Perthshire. Brian
Kemp (2) and Alan McGonigal were the other scorers. Whitburn, beaten
finalists last season, had a 4-0 over Forfar Albion.
In the all-central ties, a Tom Woods hat trick took Baillieston
through against Port Glasgow. Pollok and Maryhill will replay at
Newlandsfield next Saturday following their 1-1 draw.
Renfrew and East Craigie last met in the cup in season 1977-78,
Renfrew then went on the semi-final. On Saturday, the teams fought out a
3-3 draw with 10-man Renfrew, snatching the equaliser with a header from
substitute Scott Beattie five minutes from time.
Ayrshire teams faired well with only Hurlford dropping out. A Gerry
Paline hat trick took Kilwinning through against Buchanhaven Hearts and
a Ryan Dick double, one from the penalty spot, gave Irvine Vics a 2-0
win over Aberdeen East End.
In the Stagecoach Western League, two goals by Beith's Billy Borthwick
and Steven Quigg gave them the points against an unlucky Irvine Meadow
team.
Ex-Shettleston players Alex Eadie (2) and Martin Walsh were
Kilbirnie's scorers, but a Tom McKenzie treble and a John Halpin own
goal gave Glenafton the points.
Auchinleck's run of bad luck continued. Despite constant pressure and
a series of missed chances, it wasn't to be their day.
Cumnock and Ardeer Thistle, newly promoted from the Ayrshire second
division, tonight will contest the Scarlett Cup Final at Somerset Park,
Ayr.
The experienced Cumnock team are favourites, but Ardeer, who qualified
from a section which included Irvine Meadow and Kilwinning, cannot be
written off.
The draw for the second round of the OVD Cup due on the eleventh of
November will take place in the Banks O'Dee FC Social Club next Sunday.

Dunfermline 0, Dundee 1
ONE of the secrets of being successful in football management is
knowing when to gamble with your line-up . . . and then, like everyone
who has a weekend punt, trust to luck.
Bert Paton's luck ran out in the first division's top clash of the day
at East End Park on Saturday when he lost keeper Guido van de Kamp
injured after 38 minutes He had gambled by listing three outfield
players.
''We were the home team, and we like to attack,'' was his simple
explanation afterwards. ''We could play another 200 games and not lose
our keeper.''
The writing was on the wall as early as the tenth minute, when van de
Kamp went down with a head injury. He was treated for fully three
minutes before managing to resume.
But when he dived at the feet of Dundee striker Jim Hamilton in that
thirty-eighth minute, he was knocked out. It took half a dozen people to
lift him on to the stretcher -- he's a big lad. Afterwards, Paton said
his keeper had received stitches both outside and inside his mouth.
Paton also declined to comment further on the incident.
Out of the midfield, where he and Craig Robertson had been doing well,
came Paul Smith. ''When we play three outfield subs, Paul is our usual
standby keeper,'' said Paton. An ironic twist was that second-choice
keeper Ian Westwater gave Smith encouragement from behind the goal.
There was nothing he could do, however, to stop Paul Tosh's shot after
47 minutes, which left Smith rooted to the spot. Would van de Kamp or
Westwater have stopped it?
''I doubt it,'' said Tosh afterwards. ''I hit it really well.'' It was
a fine advance birthday present for the big forward, who will be 22 on
Wednesday.
The other irony was that, after the goal, Smith had very little to do.
The expected flood of shots never materialised.
But as skipper Norrie McCathie said: ''When an outfield player goes
into goal, the defence alters its shape to protect him as much as
possible. We close down players much more quickly, and try to make sure
they don't get any shots in. We're disappointed with the defeat, but
there's a long way to go and we're still five points ahead at the top.''
On top of his form, and playing for the second week in a row, was
Dundee manager Jim Duffy. The veteran defender may lack physical speed
these days, but the mind is still as sharp as a tack. He always seemed
to be in the right place at the right time, especially when the Fifers
pressed forward in the late stages trying to salvage a point.
Was he happy with his own performance? ''Well, they didn't score any
goals, so I couldn't have played that badly.''
Duffy praised his men for their gutsy display. ''I asked them to dig
in and go for victory, and they did just that. I am particularly pleased
for Paul Tosh. He has been one of our most consistent players all
season.''
Neil McCann also had one of his best games for Dundee this season.
Young Gerry Farrell at right back was given a tough time, and often
needed a ''minder'' as cover when the speedy winger went galloping past
him.
But suddenly, McCann would switch to the other side, where Derek
Fleming also looked uncomfortable against him.
The result not only gives Dundee encouragement, but others in the
chasing pack as well.
A word about referee Jim Herald. The game was always fast, and
sometimes a bit more furious than it should have been. He didn't get
everything right, but he did try to let it flow when there were not
bodies lying on the ground requiring treatment.
He had his yellow card out six times -- Ray Farningham, Morten
Wieghorst, and Jim Hamilton of Dundee, were noted, as were substitute
Mark McCulloch (his name went in before he even touched the ball), Andy
Tod, and Paul Kinnaird of Dunfermline.

Dundee United 2,
St Johnstone 1
IN THE eyes of many who question the ethics of modern-day football, it
took the threat of tragedy at Tannadice Park on Saturday to prove that
maybe after all, there is some decency still left in the game.
After 35 minutes of the now-accepted tribal chants of warfare between
the respective supports, the dug-out collapse of Saints' manager Paul
Sturrock, and the activity created among both sets of club officials,
saw real concern spread round the terracing ranks.
In fact, once it became clear that the unfortunate Sturrock was in
serious trouble with acute chest pains, a hushed silence fell over the
entire ground as he was stretchered out of the public gaze to await the
arrival of an ambulance.
The concern of the St Johnstone support over their leader's well-being
was understandable, but the chorus of sympathy voiced by the home fans
was a tribute to the sterling long-term service given them by Sturrock
as player and coach.
As it was, Sturrock left the premises with his name being chanted by
home fans in a display of loyalty which left a nice taste in the mouth.
And that was not the only thing the United support had to shout about
on an afternoon when the potential of manager Billy Kirkwood's spending
finally burst to the surface.
The promise of his new front line partnership of Gary McSwegan and
Owen Coyle was offered up for scrutiny for the first time, with the home
support voicing first-impression satisfaction of a pairing whose threat
will undoubtedly test the first division's best in the months ahead.
It was experienced Jim Bett who executed the mechanics of an opener
netted against the run of play 10 minutes from the interval, a
delightful free kick from 25 yards which dipped over the Perth defensive
wall before slipping in at Alan Main's near post.
The Sturrock incident followed almost immediately, and possibly
affected the visiting concentration in the minutes preceding the
half-time whistle.
Anyway, Saints lost another goal, although it was difficult to see how
they would have prevented it even with full concentration.
No danger appeared imminent until the ever-sharp McSwegan confounded
the Saints rearguard with a quality backheeler to send Coyle in to round
Main, and then fire home his first goal for his new club.
A remarkable 40-yard shot from John McQuillan which foxed Ally Maxwell
into some embarassment restored the visitors' hopes, and it took a
couple of brilliant Maxwell saves to deny first Jim Weir, then
substitute Roddy Grant from grabbing a point.

IN A move which will scandalise the Olympic movement to the core,
Diego Maradona has declared his intention to participate in the next
event in Atlanta.
Having missed the last World Cup Finals in the USA as a consequence of
his ban for drug-taking, the veteran Argentinian is eager for one last
chance to present his fading talent before a world-wide audience.
His brazen move has the support of Argentina's FA president, Julio
Grondona, and his many fans in his homeland, even though it would be
difficult to find any player so remote from the Olympic ideal.
But back with Boca Juniors, blond streak amid his greying hair, he has
been trumpeting his latest ambition on learning that all Olympic teams
will be allowed three players over the age of 23.
Maradona has already tested negative for drugs since resuming his
career with Boca.
There is now pressure on coach Daniel Passarella to recall him to the
national team. This will be actively resisted as the pair had a
much-publicised disagreement during the World Cup finals in Mexico nine
years ago and the damage has never been repaired.
* HOLLAND have again protested to UEFA about racial abuse of their
players, this time in last week's European Championship qualifying tie
in Malta.
Patrik Kluivert, Aron Winter, Michael Reiziger and Clarence Seedorf
all were targeted as the Dutch took another step towards the finals next
summer.
UEFA president Lennart Johansson indicated that another heavy fine is
likely.
By contrast Mario Basler of Werder Bremen claims he has been driven
out of Germany for racist remarks to a Moroccan opponent. His offence
resulted in a successful government appeal to Berti Vogts to drop him
from the national team.
* UEFA will be called upon to arbitrate in the row between PAOK
Salonika and Feyenoord. The Greeks claim their Dutch coach, Arie Haan,
has been poached by the Rotterdam club and are demanding his return.
Haan, who starts his new duties today preparing for the Cup-winners' tie
against Everton, vows this would be an unproductive move.
''If I have to go back to Greece, I will play the goalkeeper in attack
and put strikers in defence,'' he insisted. Salonika want #220,000
pounds compensation.

Partick Thistle 0, Rangers 4
RANGERS captain Richard Gough, currently the best central defender in
the country, yet unable to get a place in the Scotland squad, was
delighted to get Saturday's match at Firhill out of the way so that all
concentration could be focussed on Wednesday's Champions' League match
against Juventus in Turin.
''No matter how much the boss told us to forget about Juventus, that
match was still at the back of our minds today,'' said Gough after
having put Rangers on their way to victory with the opening goal against
Thistle. ''You don't get any bigger matches than Juventus in Turin, so
this one at Firhill could have been very difficult for us.
''I'm delighted that we got a couple of goals in the first half,
because that took the sting out of the match and we came through
comfortably. The Juventus manager was here and he must have been
disappopinted that we weren't worked hard enough. They certainly won't
get it as easy against Milan.
''I'm also delighted at the start we have made to the season. It's the
best since I joined the club. It's important that we win matches like
this one, for we have a lot of big games between now and January, and I
feel that clubs such as Celtic, Aberdeen, and Hibs will go to places
like Firhill and get results.''
Gough was again immense in a Rangers defence which never looked like
giving anything away on Saturday, and in 25 minutes, he pointed the way
to victory with a tremendous header from a Dave Robertson cross which
flashed past Nicky Walker before the keeper could move.
What followed was mainly exhibition stuff from Rangers, rounded off by
a hat trick from Gordon Durie -- his first in the premier division since
scoring three for Hibernian against Morton at Easter Road in February,
1985.
And later, it was revealed that Durie almost didn't play. Said manager
Walter Smith, before heading to Italy for yesterday's AC Milan-Juventus
match: ''Gordon did well to play under the circumstances. There was a
bereavment in his family a couple of days ago, and it has been a
difficult time for him.''
Durie, whose father-in-law died last week, indicated on Saturday
morning that he did not want to play, but his wife urged him to go to
Firhill. He showed tremendous professionalism under very difficult
circumstances.
He scored the first of his hat trick after 40 minutes when he was at
the back post to touch in a cross from Alex Cleland. And in 54 minutes
he struck again. Thistle defender Tommy Turner, who was later sent off,
erred in thinking that a ball was going for a goal kick and Robertson
got round him to cut back a low cross. Durie smacked the pass past
Walker. And with eight minutes left, the big striker, again given plenty
of space by the Thistle defence, headed in a cross from Stuart McCall.
It was only the third hat trick to have been scored in a premier
division match over the last two years, the others coming from Keith
Wright of Hibernian last season and Partick Thistle's Roddy Grant the
season before that.
Rangers simply coasted their way through on Saturday, safe in the
knowledge that their defence could handle anything Thistle threw at
them. Gough is certainly the inspiration, but he played down his own
contribution. Explaining his current form, he said: ''The whole team is
playing well and we have a settled defence this season wheras last term
we seemed to be chopping and changing.
''Playing in a sort of free role alongside Gordan Petric and Alan
McLaren has made my job a lot easier. They are quality players. Gordan
has really settled in well at Ibrox and he's a good lad, which is also
very important. He is so cool and nothing seems to ruffle him.
''We will be without Alan in Turin, because he is suspended. That is a
blow, but the manager has several options. We are all looking at the
Juventus match as a great challenge, playing against strikers of the
calibre of Vialli and Ravanelli. Vialli has been one of the best
strikers in the world over the years and he and Ravanelli play more of a
British type game. Personally I'm looking forward to plying against
them.
''This is a match we have to take something from. Realistically, I
feel Juventus will win our Champions' League group, but if we can get a
result on Wednesday, we would be in with a chance of taking the second
qualifying spot.''
Thoughts of Europe, of course, are a million miles away from Partick
Thistle, whose manager Murdo MacLeod must feel a great achievement in
being able to put a side on the field on a Saturday. He was reduced to a
squad of 15 before the Rangers match and is desperately seeking to sign
new players.
He said: ''There are some players here who know they will be picked
for every game, simply because our resources are so limited, and that
can't be good. We need new faces and we are trying hard to get them.
''The fault against Rangers was our defending. I felt we played
reasonably well in the first half, but we lost two bad goals. We just
couldn't defend crosses and there is no excuse for that, because our
back four are all experienced players. We had defended reasonably well
this season, but today, we didn't defend at all.''

THE world's great local derbies, as Glasgow well knows, are so much
more enjoyable when there is a truly competitive element to them.
Manchester United against Manchester City is becoming as one sided a
fixture as at any time in its 100-year history.
City's 1-0 defeat at Old Trafford on Saturday means that they have
prevailed once in the last 27 meetings, and increases the chances that
at the end of this season, the teams will find themselves in different
divisions.
Paul Scholes' fourth-minute header was enough, and Andy Cole ought to
have added more.
So United kept within four points of the leaders Newcastle,
characteristically exciting 3-2 winners away to Queen's Park Rangers
after falling behind. Les Ferdinand reminded Rangers of what they
surrendered by selling him last summer with a thunderous goal, though
Keith Gillespie's winner emanated from a faulty back-pass by Welsh
defender Karl Ready.d
Mark Hateley must be looking forward to playing alongside Daniele
Dichio, the young striker who claimed both Rangers goals with towering
headers to total six in four league games.
If Ferdinand's strike was further ammunition for those who would put
him in the England team, either alongside or in place of Alan Shearer,
the Blackburn man responded with a goal of his own in the 2-1 win over
Southampton.
Billy McKinlay, the champions' even more recent recruit from Dundee
United sat on the bench and must wait for another day.
Forest had an excellent 1-0 win at Tottenham, where the scorer was the
club's new England internationalist Steve Stone.
Howard Wilkinson, as has been well documented, was another disgruntled
manager, following Gary McAllister's injury in Sweden. The Leeds and
Scotland captain did not appear against Arsenal and a 3-0 home defeat
was an inauspicious omen for tomorrow's European tie against PSV
Eindhoven.
England's other UEFA Cup survivors Liverpool could do no better than a
goalless draw at home to Coventry, after leaving Ian Rush on the bench
and starting with Robbie Fowler alongside Stan Collymore.
It was one of Merseyside's grimmer weekends as Everton began adjusting
to life without Duncan Ferguson. They did at least end a run of four
successive league defeats in a 1-1 draw at Bolton.

DUNDEE United could be poised to splash out more of their #1.7m Billy
McKinlay windfall in the Highlands.
Tannadice scouts and another contingent from Endsleigh League division
three club Scarborough travelled to Aberdeen on Saturday to watch Cove
Rangers beat Clach 2-1.
United manager Billy Kirkwood is already enthusing about new midfield
signing Marino Keith, who last week joined the club from Fraserburgh for
close to #35,000. He is understood to be keen to snap up more bargain
buys from the north game.
Clach's young, attacking side have already been watched this season by
Hearts, Dunfermline and St Johnstone, and Stuart Golabeck is likely to
have been the main attraction.
Huntly stayed two points clear in the championship race, with
player-manager Doug Rougvie getting in on the scoring in his side's 3-0
win at Fort William.
Paul Bridgeford's 75th minute penalty proved the decisive blow as
Peterhead came up against stuffy Nairn County resistance, while Keith
scraped a 1-0 win at Deveronvale.
The biggest surprise of the day was the ease of Buckie Thistle's 4-1
win at Elgin City. Lossiemouth and Wick each had 2-1 victories over
Forres and Rothes.

STEVE ARCHIBALD and Charlie Nicholas were international team-mates on
four occasions in the eighties, and the veterans were the men who came
closest on Saturday to breaking the deadlock when East Fife and Clyde
drew a blank at Methil.
Nicholas hit a post early on and later was only fractionally wide with
a free kick, while the Fifers' player-manager had an effort cleared off
the line.
There were only two winners in the division. Berwick consolidated
their second place with a 3-1 win at Montrose Willie Irvine sealed the
points with a double in the final half hour after Graeme Fraser's opener
had been cancelled by a header from the home side's Neil McAvoy.
Willie Wilson scored after only two minutes of his debut for Ayr
United but Stenhousemuir hit back through Gareth Hutchison and took away
the points via an own goal by Tony Shepherd.
Gary Higgins hit Forfar's equaliser after Lex Grant had put Stranraer
ahead, and the points were shared also at Forthbank where Queen of the
South's Andy McFarlane joined Stirling's Ian McInnes for an early bath
in a game of seven bookings.

EXCUSE me, but a guy here says your love feels the way trumpets sound.
It's like a mountain or a church with open doors. Your life is like the
ocean and he wants to jump in naked.
It's that Mike Scott again, all by himself with his flashing eyes and
floating hair. The woman on the receiving end of his metaphorical
onslaught will have to choose her own words carefully, because Mike will
dance rings round her.
Not only that, but in the wider social context the sorting out of the
Scott Karma involves stargazing, trespass on standing stones,
threatening to blow down Edinburgh Castle and invocations of the great
god Pan.
We can definitely get him for some of this, breach of the peace being
the least of it.
Even the reflective, confessional side of Scott's new album, Bring 'Em
All In, received an injection of nervous energy and a punishment of
acoustic guitars which makes you wonder how the rest of the Waterboys
could ever keep up with him. This solo work, shorn of its studio
production, is both big and intimate. The old songs give the impression
of the clock turning back, as if the Waterboys project still lies in the
future and that we are the first privileged to hear them.
Mike Scott may shake his tousled head and make a play of losing out
against the affectionate heckling, but we know that he is a shaman and a
man possessed. Weave a circle round him thrice for safety.

Theatre
MORE living history given vigorous form in the Borders Festival, as
Rideout Theatre Company team up with a large band of willing locals to
re-enact an invasion that never was. Performed at the weekend in the
atmospheric grounds of the skeletal Jedburgh Abbey -- with a location
like this who needs theatre? -- and with repeat showings coming up at
Traquair House and Melrose Abbey, The False Alarm! is a vivid yet
entertainingly tongue-in-cheek flashback to the year 1804 when 150,000
of Napoleon's men looked set to take on the Scottish Borders.
Variously characterising Napoleon as an eater of babies and a friend
of the devil, Walter Elliot's play is a fragmented series of scenes and
set pieces that begin as the audience is press ganged into the army and
continue as a sleepy community wakes up to the possibility of a
devastating war.
Anne Plenderleith's production is a suitably eclectic affair,
sprawling in and around the abbey with puppet pageants, flaming beacons,
a pipe band, and much military parading. The scenes in the abbey itself
work the best, the walls seeming to bring a focus to the community's
mounting dilemma, but even in the fully outdoor scenes there's a clarity
of direction and diction that must have been hard won.
And to wrap it all up the production culminates in splendid community
style in the local public hall with food, drink, dance, song, and story
as the cast marches in for a period ceilidh. I've received some odd
backhanders in my time, but never stew and mash.

THERE is a new spirit of optimism among everyone associated with
Albion Rovers which even Saturday's 2-1 home defeat by East
Stirlingshire could not suppress. The club will be staying at
Cliftonhill, and that is the clear wish of the fans as well as the new
board, led by David Shanks.
Rovers paid for missing a couple of first-half sitters and trailed to
two excellent finishes by Mike Geraghty. Gordon Young pulled one back
but 'Shire held on for their first league win of the season.
Referee Graeme Alison did neither side any favours by sending off
Craig Shanks and the visitors' Iain Lee as well as issuing seven
bookings.
Livingston and Brechin City remain first and second after their
goalless draw at Meadowbank, while Ross County paid dearly for a
catalogue of missed chances at Alloa, where a Mark Whyte header kept the
points at home.
Cowdenbeath's David Scott equalised strikes by Alan Hercher and
Richard Hastings at Inverness, but Iain Stewart's last-minute lob gave
Caley Thistle the points.
Steve McCormick's seventh goal of the season was wiped out along with
Arbroath's lead because of a thick mist 14 minutes from time. Queen's
Park will again try to avoid a fifth straight away defeat when they
return to Gayfield tomorrow.

ATHLETICS: GREAT MIDLAND RUN
LIZ McColgan scorched to victory over 10 kilometres at the BUPA Great
Midland Run in Coventry and then insistedshe has the appetite and
enthusiasm to surpass her outstanding past achievements.
The Dundee Hawkhill runner sees her future as being over the much
longer marathon distance and has set a target of victory in next year's
Olympics. And after four major British race wins in five weeks, McColgan
is convinced she can run even faster.
It is now a year since she returned to action at the same Coventry
venue after an 18-month lay-off with a steady stream of serious
injuries, which she insists are now history. After storming around the
crowded course in 32min 06secs, she forecast: ''I think I can go a lot
better over the marathon than I have ever done before.''
McColgan was 21 seconds quicker than when she recorded the fastest
time by a British woman in Edinburgh a fortnight ago -- she was
convinced that she could have gone even faster. ''I changed my race plan
when I heard Klara Kashopova was competing,'' she explained.
''I was told she had a fairly fast time over the distance this year so
I took it easy for the first three kilometres. When I looked around, I
couldn't see her so I pressed ahead. I'm pleased with my performance --
it was a fairly tough course and the wind was blowing in my face for
much of the time.''
The threat from Kashopova never materialised, the Russian champion
finishing second in 33-26, with Katy McCandless, of the USA and
Parkside, third in 33-36.
McColgan, normally extremely self-critical after a race, finally
admitted that her training and racing -- supervised by Norwegian
distance legend Grete Waitz -- was well ahead of target. ''I didn't
expect to run such a fast time today,'' added the Scot. ''I've had a
heavy week's training, including an 18-mile session on Thursday.
Honestly, my legs seemed dead before the race.''
But she contradicted that statement during the race as, running in a
2000-strong mixed field, her confidence and strength enabled her to
finish twenty-ninth overall.
Today McColgan packs her bags before departing for 24 days of altitude
training in Mexico City. Then she and husband Peter will descend to sea
level 10 days before next month's Tokyo marathon.
There, McColgan will face world-class opposition and the result will
allow her and Waitz to decide whether to repeat the same Mexico build-up
for the Olympic Games or to adopt another approach.
In yesterday's men's race, James Kariuki, brother of recently
reinstated five-times world cross-country champion John Ngugi, was a
runaway winner. The Kenyan broke away after only three kilometres to win
in 28-18.
Second place went to Andrew Pearson, of Longwood Harriers, with a time
of 28-35, while defending champion Gary Staines was third in 28-44.
* HOLDER Alan Robson (Leslie Deans RC) won his fifth, and
fourth-in-a-row, Falkirk DC Peoples Half Marathon, at Grangemouth
yesterday in 68min 33sec, beating clubmate Gregor Booth by six seconds
and veteran holder Brian Kirkwood by 23.
Jack Gourley (Law and District) was first Superveteran and
twenty-third overall in 80-05. Veteran Erica Christie (unattached,
Glasgow) easily won the women's race in 86-27 from Giffnock North's
Julie Armstrong (93-03).

Stewart's-Melville 23,
Dundee HS FP 32
WHEN Dundee High went 19-0 ahead after just 22 minutes at Inverleith,
there seemed little prospect of a finish in which the result could go
either way.
Yet Stewart's-Melville's fightback almost brought them a remarkable
victory which they might have achieved if, as backs' coach Ian McLean
remarked: ''We'd had the bounce of the ball.''
With five minutes remaining and two points between the teams, Doug
Wyllie sent a drop goal attempt wide when there could have been a chance
of a try outside him. Instead, it was Dundee who pulled out of reach
with a fly hack and chase try by Stewart Pearson when some Colleges
handling broke down in midfield. Chris Robinson's conversion meant that
the winning margin flattered the visitors.
However, McLean is still confident that his side can get out of
relegation trouble. ''I think we can beat any team in the league, but we
have to play for 80 minutes,'' he said. ''We can't afford to give away
two or three scores and play catchup rugby.''
Meanwhile, coach Tom Dymock was disappointed that the Dundonians
failed to press home their advantage. ''We knew Stew-Mel would run the
ball back at us, but our attitude in the second half and the forwards'
fitness have to be questioned.''
Dymock was right in saying that it was an entertaining game for the
spectators. Dundee raced in front in 14 minutes with a well worked try
by Dougie Gray after an intrusion from fullback Mark Lamont had taken
play into the Colleges' 22.
Almost immediately, Derek Milne broke upfield to send scrum half Giles
Sandford behind the posts, and five minutes later Paul Rouse crossed for
a third try, Robinson converting both,
But Stewart's-Melville clawed their way back before half-time with
Graeme Stirling landing a penalty and converting a try by Julian Scott
from Wyllie's well-placed grub kick.
Despite the home team's domination from then on, Dundee just kept
their noses in front. Wyllie looped Scott to touch down and Stirling
converted, but Robinson replied with a drop goal. Stirling then thumped
over a penalty, only for Dundee's New Zealand stand-off to do likewise,
and lastly, Stirling's third penalty was cancelled out by Pearson's late
breakaway try.
Stewart's-Melville -- G Stirling; A Huett, F Pollock, J Scott, M
Tweedie; D Wyllie, G Burns; J Blackhall, A Cadzow, J Conlin, M Paton, W
Faulds, K Dobson, D Clark, N Penny.

CHICAGO MARATHON
EAMONN Martin spent a penny and hit the jackpot in the Chicago
Marathon yesterday. The 37-year-old Basildon runner sprinted to victory
after having had to make an unscheduled stop with 17 miles of the race
gone.
It cost him nearly half-a-minute, but he battled his way back and
caught up with the leaders after 21 miles.
Martin went on to outpace Mexican Carlos Bautista in 2hr 11min 18sec
and collect top prize of #23,000. ''I felt very strong,'' he said after
winning by three seconds in the 11,000-strong event.
''I'm very difficult to beat in the last quarter of a mile -- not just
because I can sprint fast, but because I've learned good tactics on the
track.''
It was his first marathon away from London, where he won on his debut
in 1993, was eighth in 1994, and thirteenth this year.
Now he joins Peter Whitehead, fourth in this summer's World
Championship, and former World Cup winner Richard Nerurkar at the head
of the queue for the three places in Britain's team for next year's
Olympics in Atlanta.
Colorado-based Welshman Steve Jones, the course record-holder, did not
finish the race. The women's winner was Finn Ritva Lemettinen, in
2-28-39.

TOP Scottish permit holder Mrs Dawn Goodfellow opened her account for
the new season at Kelso with a dazzling double by her highly-rated
chaser Kilcolgan and novice hurdler Tough Test.
After Kilcolgan, the 4-5 favourite, had thrashed Side of Hill by 14
lengths in a match over an extended three miles, she acknowledged he
could be a future Grand National prospect. Kilcolgan, bought at the late
Arthur Stephenson's dispersal sale, may have had only one to beat in the
Greenmantle Ale Anthony Marshall Trophy Handicap Chase, but he did did
it convincingly.
Brian Storey jumped him into a three-length lead with a circuit to go
and increased his advantage in the back straight. Although Graham Lee
tried desperately to get Side of Hill back on terms approaching the home
turn, Kilcolgan lengthened his stride going up the hill to win at his
ease.
Mrs Goodfellow who won the race last year with Charlotte's Emma, now
in foal, confirmed the handsome eight-year-old chesnut will probably go
to Ayr next month to take on the likes of Jodami in the Sean Graham
Chase.
She said: ''He improves every time he runs and is getting stronger and
stronger. I've always thought a lot of him. I think he is a National
horse.''
As a novice chaser he was an impressive winner at Ayr and Kelso,
earning a rating of 100 from Timeform and swelling the reputation of Mrs
Goodfellow's small family yard at Earlston.
In 1994-95 Mrs Goodfellow not only won The Herald Leading Scottish
Permit-Holder Award, but with eight winners -- her best ever -- was
Britain's top permit trainer.
Tough Test, 4-1, completed a 9-1 double for her husband Jimmy, who
owns both horses, when he took the Edinburgh City FC Amateur Riders'
Novices' Hurdle with the 4-9 favourite Recluse 11 lengths adrift.
Winner of a point-to-point in Ireland, Tough Test had been
disappointing in his three runs so far, last of five finishers to Huge
Mistake at Perth recently.
Richard Hale took him to the front at the third flight and was never
really troubled by the market leader, who had won by an effortless 10
lengths at Carlisle.
A notorious character, Tough Test had ''trashed'' a racecourse stable
door, lashing out with his feet before the race.
Briar's Delight, given a strong ride by Jedburgh-born jockey Stephen
Melrose, took the Scottish Racing Club Hurdle for Dick Allan, staying on
in the final stages to beat Vain Prince, the 2-1 favourite.
It was a disappointing meeting for leading Scottish trainers Peter
Monteith and Lucinda Russell. Monteith's Wild Rose of York was overtaken
on the run-in by joint favourite Larn Fort, while the gallant efforts of
Miss Russell's Two for One were not enough to hold off Gale Ahead.

It has been fun over the last few weeks of the leagues watching how
rugby has gone full circle back to the way the forwards used to play in
the 70's.
THE saying goes that the more things change, the more they stay the
same.
My mind wandered back a few years to when I played. Mighty Mouse
himself, Ian McLauchlan, was asked to take us for a session at Glasgow
Accies one evening.
What he advocated during part of the session was that players went
into contact aggressively, then turned to give the ball to supporting
players who would try to keep the ball off the ground or maul it.
This particular piece of coaching was greeted with a great deal of
shaking of heads and disbelief because it was around this time that Jim
Telfer had defined the head-first rucking style that was to characterise
Scottish forward play for a very long time indeed.
So it has been fun over the last few weeks of the leagues watching how
rugby has gone full circle back to the way the forwards used to play in
the 70's.
There was Stuart Reid, arguably the most dynamic back row forward of
the season, running at the Heriot's defence for Boroughmuir last week,
making impact, and then turning to offload the ball or set it up.
That was how Willie John McBride's Lions played in 1974. That was how
most of us played at school. And that's what was coached out of most
players in the 1980s and early 90s, but is now making a comeback.
It was always about protection of the ball, of course. The logic
behind driving low and aggressively, and always head first, but perhaps
with one bent arm up acting as a fender, was that it was almost
impossible for the opposition to tackle you and knock you back.
Further logic said that if the ball was placed on the ground early in
the ritual there would be even more chance of keeping it. The backs
could then time their runs into the line because they could see the ball
trickle back along the ground and watch as the scrum half picked it up.
But defences got wise. They ended up fanning out, and a purely rucking
team, or certainly one that put the ball on the ground too early in the
ruck, would commit more people to a ruck than would a defence.
Scotland, the season before last, tried to combat that by the man in
possession driving as far as he could before he and the ball went to
ground so that the defence had to get involved or go back at a rate of
knots. Last season, it was quick transfer that was the order of the day.
Which is why it's so strange to see it all turn full circle. I can see
weaknesses in turning our backs too often as a small country with small
players, because the one thing you do when you turn is you expose those
spare little ribs that big bad forwards like to try to break with their
shoulders and you end up hurtling backwards. Not very nice.
What's next then? Playing the ball with your feet after the tackle and
double banking? Probably.
*A 10-MAN brawl near the end of the match, and a heated discussion
between a coach and a referee after the game, marred a close contest
between Cartha Queen's Park and Allan Glen's on Saturday. Glen's No.8
Paul Reilly got his marching orders when he failed to stop fighting
after the referee had blown his whistle.
''I felt the referee should have blown earlier when all hell broke
loose,'' said Glen's coach Wilson Fulton.
"I had a wee chat with him after the game over a pint, and it is fair
to say that I was upset at the time. It was a close game when the fight
broke out, we were a point down at 19-20, and we felt that the referee
had just failed to see what should have been a penalty to us.
''Cartha then won with the penalty and that was the end of the game
and, as far as I know, no names other than Reilly's were taken. I now
completely accept that his decision was right and that our player
deserved to be sent off.''
Cartha were pleased to have won, but were shocked at the afternoon's
happenings.
''We also had our Under-18 international prop Robert Harvie
stretchered off,'' said Cartha president Alan Irons. One Cartha official
alleges that the player was stamped on.
''And their coach remonstrated with the referee after the match and we
understand that he is to be the subject of a report.''
Murray Clayton, the refereeing assessor at the match, was not
contactable yesterday. It sounds like fun and games doesn't it?

LADBROKES yesterday professed to being ''very pleased'' with the
initial response to the launch of 'Win and Show' betting in their shops
on Saturday.
Company spokesman Ian Wassell confirmed there had been a positive
reaction from their clients and a good degree of understanding about how
the bet works.
''A lot of people were talking about it and a pleasing number were
trying it, although we haven't got any figures yet. The Champion Stakes
proved to be an ideal win and show race with Spectrum and Riyadian both
popular at 1/3 the odds 1-2,'' added Wassell
'Win &amp; Show' betting involves picking a horse to finish first or
second in any race with eight or more runners. Successful punters are
paid a third of the win odds, rising to a half in handicaps with 16 or
more runners.

GLASGOW Accies take on the role of championship favourites with their
47-9 win at Musselburgh.
Their match at Anniesland next Saturday against Kirkcaldy, the only
team to beat them in the first round of clashes, now looms as an
important psychological barrier.
Musselburgh, victors over Kirkcaldy last time out, matched Accies for
the first 50 minutes. The teams turned with Accies 11-9 ahead and the
next scoring chance fell to Neil Lockhart. His penalty rate was three
from three, but this one shaded away.
Accies response was to score 17 points in five minutes! Torquil
Mathewson roared in. Calum MacGregor converted, touched down himself and
then threaded through the opposition from his own twenty-two, chipped
over the full-back and collected for a magnificent try which he
converted.
MacGregor had already touched down before the break and he kicked in
all three conversions, a penalty and a drop goal.
Before the end, further tries came from Mike Davis, Andrew Mason and
Mathewson.
Kirkcaldy got back on track with a 20-10 home win over Grangemouth to
remain on the shoulder of joint leaders Accies and Biggar.
Grangemouth opened the scoring against the run of play with a Mike
Tuckerman try. The Fifers hit back with winger Neil Renton scoring and
John Mitchell converting from touch and then goaling a penalty for a
10-5 interval lead.
Kirkcaldy footered their way through the second half until, with 15
minutes left, flanker Andy Henderson drove forward from a five metres
scrum and sent scrum half Ross Dewar over with Mitchell converting.
Grangemouth were gifted a second breakaway try, again to Tuckerman,
but Mitchell closed proceedings with a difficult penalty.
Biggar slipped home 15-9 from a dreary encounter with Preston Lodge.
With the packs effectively killing the ball, there was little back-play
and all the points came from penalties.
With Dennis Lavery and Rodney Gibb dividing four first half successes,
the score was tied near the break when home full-back Malcolm Bruce
succeeded from long range.
Gibb pulled it back to 9-9 in the second period, but two more Lavery
successes settled it.
Peebles beat pointless Corstorphine 36-5 to break a losing sequence.
There were five try scorers -- Rab Wilson, Gordon Wilson, Willie Napier,
David Gray, Keith Nisbet -- plus a penalty try for collapsing, with
conversions from Andre Bell (two) and Robert Wilson. The visitors' try
came from David Williamson.

Kelso 36, Currie 17
''WE were gutted to lose the second half 27-0,'' Currie coach Bruce
Macnaughton summed up his team's feelings after Kelso had shown a dogged
determination in turning another seeming defeat into a stunning victory.
''If you're going to do anything, you've got to come down here and
win,'' noted Macnaughton, as he reflected on Currie's second successive
defeat to Borders opposition.
Currie's game plan, built around their large and impressive pack, was
to keep the play tight and batter their way up the field, aided Ally
Donaldson's pinpoint kicking.
Certainly, the plan bore fruit early on, Donaldson slotting two
penalties as a rattled Kelso infringed in the face of the Currie
onslaught.
Using their bulk to good affect, the visitors were soon camped once
more on Kelso's line and a series of scrums provided the inevitable try,
lock Mark Blair crashing over for the score. Donaldson missed the
conversion but added two further penalty goals as his forwards rumbled
Kelso into costly errors.
Kelso's attempts to fulfil coach Eric Paxton's desire for expansive
15-man rugby all too often had foundered on basic mistakes but their
commitment was more than evident. As the game progressed, their
confidence grew -- inspired in no little way by the efforts of their
back row with veteran John Jeffrey's rampagings ably supported by a
lively and impressive Adam Roxburgh.
Credit must go to home full back Graeme Aitchison, whose goal-kicking
punished Currie's transgressions and ensured his team never quite lost
touch with the visitors as he landed four penalty goals to keep the
margin to one score.
With threequarters of the match gone, Kelso's perseverance finally
brought its reward as they overhauled Currie with two trys in quick
succession. Roxburgh was key to both scores, first scooping the ball
from a ruck to pass to stand-off Scott Tait for his try and then, as
Kelso capitalised on the loose restart kick, providing the ball for
David Baird's thrilling 35-metre chip-and-chase score.
Aitchison converted both and added a fifth penalty goal.
Currie's inability to adapt their game proved crucial and, when in
desperation, they finally attempted to open up, Ben Mannion pounced on
the interception, sprinting 65 metres to score Kelso's third try.
Aitchison's conversion provided the icing for Kelso.
Kelso -- G Aitchison; D Baird, G Laing, B Mannion, J Thomson; S Tait,
I Fairley; J Ramage, K Thomson, R Hogarth, S Rowley, I Fullarton, S
Bennet, A Roxburgh, J Jeffrey.
Currie -- D Wilson; C Robertson, M Plumb, M Tonkin, G Keen; A
Donaldson, R Hunter; C Boyd, G Ellis, D Massie, C Eagle, M Blair, B
Ward, S Hardie, F Thompson. Replacement -- B McNaughten for S Hardie (52

GHK 30, Jed-Forest 26
THE Jekyll and Hydes of the second division have done it again. Even
Jed coach Donald Miller had to admit: ''GHK are either magnificent or
murder. From our point of view, we got them on the wrong day.''
There was a rather pessimistic air around Old Anniesland before the
match . . . and at the end not a fingernail worth biting. To the neutral
viewer there was a great game of rugby. To the fans of either side, it
could have gone either way.
The GHK side was virtually a reserve line-up because nine first-team
regulars were missing, but they showed tremendous self-belief and pulled
off a surprise result.
They knew the Jed strength lay in the back row and their cohesion with
Gary Armstrong. The Glasgow side worked hard to nullify that and, in
doing so, their own back row came out with great credit.
The match was wide open right to the closing minutes. But two amazing
tries earlier had done the trick for GHK.
The home side were trailing for the first time in the game by 21-18
after 54 minutes. Then George Breckenridge burst into the limelight by
scything through at pace for a try which Harry Bassi converted.
Then, in 73 minutes, Geoff Hawkes swooped for a try from halfway. He
received from Andy Ness and took off at pace and cut inside replacement
winger Graham Renwick. Full back Chris Richards was then passed on the
inside and, although Gary Armstrong grabbed him on the line, Hawkes had
the strength to go over. Bassi failed with the conversion but it still
left the Borderers needing two scores to win.
In a frenetic finish, they got one back -- a try through Renwick but
the Glasgow side held out for an unexpected victory.
GHK led 11-6 at the interval through two Bassi penalties and the first
of Breckenridge's brace of touchdowns, to two penalties by Richards.
Within two minutes of the restart Jed had GHK in a panic and scored a
soft try through Duncan Hemming and the scores were level. However Jed
were asleep when Murray Wallace stole over following a quickly taken
free kick and left Bassi with an easy conversion.
But a simple try by Kevin Armstrong, goaled by Richards, levelled the
scores once again.
It was then that the two tries, by Breckenridge and Hawkes, put GHK in
the driving seat.
GHK -- G Breckenridge; S Little, T Sanderson, H Bassi, G Hawkes; J
McLeod, A Kerr; S Gay, C Docherty, G MacIlwham, M Adams, K Wilson, A
Ness, M Wallace, I Sinclair.
Jed-Forest -- C Richards; K Amos, D Hemming, G Scott, M Yule; G
McKechnie, G Armstrong; N McIlory, K Barrie, G Kerr, A Dunnitt, C Hynd,
K Armstrong, R Kirkpatrick, C Brown. Replacement -- S Turnbull for Scott
(46 minutes), G Renwick for Turnbull (61).
Referee -- R Dickson (Madras FP).
SCORERS: GHK -- Bassi, 2p, 2c; Breckenridge, 2t; Wallace, 1t; Hawkes,

West of Scotland 39, Selkirk 14
IT seems that the tide is beginning to turn for West of Scotland.
After a number of narrow defeats, the victories are starting to come,
and with a bit of style and conviction at that.
This latest win against a hugely disappointing Selkirk side puts West
into joint second spot in Division Two and they must now fancy their
chances of a tilt at the top in the tension of the weeks to come.
As the coaching team keeps stressing, this is a young West side but a
side which is growing up on every viewing and which is beginning to
operate more as a unit than a gathering of talented individuals.
The Selkirk pack were no match for their hosts and while at times this
looked like a training spree for the West eight, there is no doubt that
a new-found steel is at the heart of their approach and, coupled with
excellent fitness levels, is making them a force to be reckoned with.
The Bulloch brothers continue to impress and Tony Greenshields has the
makings of a fine full back. He is adding that edge of bravery -- or is
it madness -- needed to make the vital hits or catch the tricky balls to
his pace and handling skills.
West took a pleasingly simple approach to this game with a combination
of tactical kicking -- yes, this correspondent will accept kicking when
it is the right option -- and attacks with ball in hand.
Forwards and backs combined well to wear down an initially stuffy
Selkirk side which was eventually to crumble and look very ordinary.
The strain was etched in the normally cheerful countenance of John
Rutherford and there were few of his charges looking him straight in the
eye as they tucked into their post-match meal.
He said: ''I can't believe we played as badly as that. There is a lot
of work to be done and our lack of forward power is nothing that a
couple of six foot eight giants won't put right. Have you any phone
numbers?'' The most disappointing aspect of this lack of power up front
is the fact that the back division, like many out of Philiphaugh in the
past, looks the part, with the ability of Scott Tomlinson to deal with
some awful possession and release the silky skills of Scott Nichol.
There is real punch, too, in the centre from Kiwi David Gage but all
too often he was left stranded in the middle of the field as the cavalry
came too late.
Keith McConnell took some good line out ball but Bev Johnston's
undoubted talents are too often taking up in petty confrontations and
the back row tried hard but was seriously short of firepower.
The scoring was opened with a penalty goal in the opening minute by
Barrett and while Selkirk soaked up early pressure it was just a matter
of time before the defence cracked and David McLeish followed up
Barrett's break for the opening try which the stand-off converted.
An interception try by Jeremy Brett after slack passing from the West
forwards, which Rodney Pow goaled, gave Selkirk fresh hope before Robbie
Little finished off good interplay between Barrett and John Lonergan
with a try which Barrett converted.
The demolition really began in the second half as the tries came thick
and fast. Alan Williamson was on the score sheet within a minute of the
restart after Stott broke blind and linked with Scott McKechnie to
release the winger who squeezed over in the corner.
Alan Bulloch snapped up his try from the chase and pick-up of David
Riding's hack ahead but Riding was not to be upstaged as he finished off
Lonergan's bulldozing run with a try.
The try of the game came from Selkirk, scant consolation though that
will be, as a short penalty led to the ball passing through the hands of
Nichol and Pow for Michael Jaffray to cross in the corner and Pow to
convert.
Gordon Bulloch completed the scoring as he took Stott's pass for a try
which Barrett converted.
West of Scotland -- A C D Greenshields; D Riding, A J Bulloch, R
Little, A Williamson; D N Barrett, F H Stott; S McGregor, G C Bulloch, D
Jamieson, S G McKechnie, G C Perrett, D R McLeish, J Lonergan, J Shaw.

Watsonians 29, Gala 17
GORDON Hannah, the Watsonian No.8, left the field 10 minutes early due
to a bruised sternum. To the relief of himself, his club, and probably
the North and Midlands, for whom he is qualified, the knock is unlikely
to keep him on the sidelines.
Hannah had given a barn-storming display, scoring one try and setting
up another as Watsonians maintained, if a little uneasily at times,
their championship challenge. The man of the match was keen to know if
the specators had enjoyed it.
I believe around 3000 of them did, for it was a game of exciting
passages in which fortunes ebbed and flowed. Even the injured Scott
Hastings -- ''I just hate watching'' -- was seen to applaud.
These are grim Gala days, though, anchored as they are deep in
relegation waters. Yet they had two excellent spells during which they
were worth more points than they scored.
Coach Peter Dods reflected ruefully that when Lady Luck deserts, ''the
breaks all go the other way''. No better example of this was the
incident in the thirty-second minute, when the visitors were leading
10-6.
Gala fly-half Gavin Dalgleish popped over a dropped goal. Even as he
swung at the ball, however, the referee blew for a penalty to his side.
Dalgleish then missed the penalty. Ouch!
Dods also made a passionate plea, with which I fully agree, for
tactical substitutions to be permitted. ''I do not believe boys take up
rugby to sit on a bench,'' he said.
Dalgleish, a former Scottish Schools cap, is only 19 and he could
build a useful half-back partnership with the quick thinking David
Paterson. The fly-half opened the scoring with a penalty before Gavin
Hastings kicked his first penalty. Three more were to follow in the
first half, Himself kicking with such majestic authority that the sound
alone was enough to tell you it was over.
In between times young Dalgeish added to his laurels by posting the
defence the wrong way for a cheeky try, converting himself.
Yet another Hastings penalty was followed by a fine try from John
Kerr, Hannah having cleared the route. Hastings converted that and
Hannah's touchdown, a score in which every member of the home back row
was involved.
But big Gav could do nothing to stop the final Gala try, Mark
Moncrieff, chipping the full back and easily winning the race to the
line. Dalgleish converted.
Tom Weir twice came within spitting distance of the line, but the
Maroons were to leave disappointed.
There was not as great a difference between the teams as the league
positions would suggest; that is little consolation to a proud club like
Gala.

Melrose 38, Heriot's FP 10
NOT for the first time this season have Melrose toyed with their
opponents for much of the game before delivering a series of blows in
the later stages. So it was on Saturday at the Greenyards, where Melrose
-- locked at 10-10 going into the last quarter -- threw off the shackles
to score 28 points in an 18-minute period of total control.
Moreover, 21 of these points in the final quarter were scored in the
last six minutes as Melrose found their rhythm behind the scrum to turn
a victory into a rout. Now, by not letting up, Melrose may have
demonstrated a trait of champions, but there are still areas in the
Borderers' play that might cast doubts over their ability to secure a
fifth league title.
Notably their problems in the set scrums where Heriot's front five
took the honours with sustained pressure. Admittedly, the late
withdrawal of Kevin Allan for Melrose necessitated a front row reshuffle
that resulted in Millan Browne being deployed on the tighthead where he
is undoubtedly less effective and Mark Ross coming in on the left side.
There was a further change, too, in the Melrose front row with Steve
Brotherstone being played instead of Steve Scott at hooker.
Having two such quality players vying for the same position -- and
both now in contention for district and A team places -- certainly poses
a problem for Melrose who must decide between the greater bulk of
Brotherstone and the more accurate throwing in of Scott.
Heriot's may have scrummaged powerfully but thereafter all manner of
things went wrong. Too often the back row guddled good ball or the half
backs kicked away possession aimlessly. In addition there was a
disappointingly high number of unforced errors committed by a Goldenacre
side weakened by the retirement just after half time of Gordon Lawrie.
The wonder was that Heriot's stayed in the game for such a long time.
Committed tackling in the first half and a brief period of adventurous
rugby that all but produced tries for Graham Dall and Hugh Gilmour,
however, made this possible.
His dash to the line was arrested by a try saving tackle from Craig
Chalmers, underlying once more just how good a defensive player the
Scotland stand-off has become. Offensively Chalmers was also in good
form, the Melrose stand-off who appeared to take the long pass of Bryan
Repdpath very close to the gain line, showing a willingness to have a
tilt at the opposition, albeit that initially many of his breaks were
inside.
The one blip on Chalmers' performance was his goal-kicking, which
produced zero success from four attempts. Thereafter Gary Parker took
over and, as if to create further discomfort for his stand-off, Parker
proved infallible with conversions of tries by Andy Purves, Nick
Broughton, Graham Shiel and Jimmy Turnbull. So much for the the Grant
Fox video.
Melrose -- D Bain; A Purves, J Turnbull, G Shiel, G Parker; C
Chalmers, B Redpath; M Ross, S Brotherstone, M Browne, R Brown, G Weir,
S Aitken, I Fea'unati, N Broughton.

IT is no secret that Scotland's director of rugby, Jim Telfer, is a
great admirer of the way they do things in New Zealand.
He commends the intensity, the dedication to the cause, and the killer
instinct which the men in black have displayed down through the years.
When he declares that winning, not playing, for Scotland is what counts
he is reading from the same hymn sheet as Colin Meads, old Pinetree
himself, who maintains that great All Blacks are victorious All Blacks.
Telfer's admiration for the Kiwi way comes to mind in light of the
comments on these pages on Saturday by the new chief executive of
Canterbury, Steve Tew. You will recall -- and if not you haven't been
paying attention -- that Tew revealed that New Zealand's representatives
in the Rupert Murdoch bankrolled International Provincial Competition --
involving teams from NZ, South Africa and Australia -- would be five
sides created from among the country's top 125 players.
The five sides would be selected from geographically recognisable
catchment areas so that player and fan loyalty would not be entirely
negated but the five sides would not, as a matter of course, be those
which finished top of the pile in the domestic inter-provincial series.
The top 125 players would be those under contract, and paid by, the
NZRFU and the intention was to have them all playing high-grade rugby in
what is intended to be the world's premier non-Test showcase.
In the context of the new European championship, one wonders if Telfer
sees here a template for how Scotland might be represented in the new
tournament once we become involved next season.
The argument as to just who will represent Scotland rumbles on.
Melrose and Watsonians are the foremost antagonists in favour of the
club route. Well, as current top dogs in the Scottish game, they would
wouldn't they? However, they will have the very dickens of a job
persuading their club rivals that they should be allowed to carry the
saltire into Europe.
Turkeys don't vote for Christmas and if two, or three, clubs were
handed the keys to the sponsorship cash vault which exposure in Europe
will provide them with, then the top players would gravitate towards
those clubs, the fine balance which provides fair competition on the
domestic scene would vanish, and, one would suggest, quite a few clubs
with it.
If the districts are to be the chosen route then the equation would be
complicated still further if, as last season, the Anglos turn out to be
district champions once again.
Whether the Anglos would be appropriate and practical ambassadors in
Europe for Scotland is another issue (it could be argued that it would
be hypocritical to suggest otherwise in view of the contribution which
they make to the national side) but the fact of the matter is that
appropriate, or practical, or not, the ultimate decision might lie not
at Murrayfield but south of the Cheviots.
If, for instance, Bath were challenging in the European championship
would they allow the likes of Eric Peters, David Hilton or Andy Nicol to
be spirited away to Scotland. Of course they wouldn't.
Tonight the SRU meet representatives of the national squad for the
first real bout of negotiations which will lead to the players being
placed under contract before the first Test against Western Samoa next
month. The SRU have already said that the ''national'' contract will
take precedence over anything that players might sign with their clubs.
Will this apply to those national squad members who do not play their
club rugby in Scotland? Will the Anglos even be allowed by their clubs
to play district rugby next season? Will Melrose and Watsonians get
their way? Will Scotland follow the New Zealand model and create two or
three one-off outfits to compete in Europe? Answers on a postcard to the
SRU, Murrayfield, Edinburgh.

Hawick 23, Stirling County 15
SCOTT Welsh hit the nail squarely on the head. The Hawick stand-off,
who for the second weekend in succession was responsible for all of his
side's points, said it was all about having faith in the players around
you.
There's a lesson here for Stirling, who were disrupted by injury to
four key players. Kevin McKenzie, Gareth Flockhart, Gus Turner, and
Kenny Harper were out from the start. John Manson, strangely, quit at
half-time because of flu and Jim Brough departed early in the second
half with an ankle injury.
Accordingly, Stirling played like strangers in the dark. There was no
faith. No belief. No pattern. And neither was there an answer to
Hawick's predetermined strategy of bringing men down the middle, with
the back-row quickly in attendance, and edging the Stirling foragers out
of the game.
''Truly amateur'', was how coach Brian Edwards described the
performance, which was all the more galling considering how well they
had played in victory over Melrose the week before.
But none of the above is to detract from the Hawick performance. They
knew what they had to do to record the Premiership double over Stirling
and they did it well.
The Hawick captain, Brian Renwick, in particular, had a fine game, the
big No.8 shrugging off what initially looked like a serious neck injury
to lead his troops with vigorous conviction.
Scott Welsh, though, was the most influential player afield. He
displayed a beguiling mix of boot and break and his two tries both came
from visionary opportunism, allied to flaring pace off the mark and, it
has to be said, lamentable defending by the Stirling tacklers who were
conspicuous only by their absence.
Welsh, a 27-year-old who played fly-half for Scotland under-18 against
Scotland Schools when the schoolboys' stand-off was Craig Chalmers, has
had his sparkling form rewarded with an inviation to attend the Scottish
squad session at Murrayfield last week. He is a son of the ex-Hawick and
Scotland centre Robbie Welsh.
On Saturday, Welsh the younger was being lauded by Hawick backs' coach
Jim Renwick. The ex-Scotland centre, who has forgotten more about flair
and opportunism than most folk will ever know, declared: ''It could have
been an entirely different ball game if two of Mark McKenzie's penalty
kicks had not come off the posts but we did have these two great tries
by Scotty and it's good to see refreshing individualism like that.''
But those two McKenzie kicks which came rebounding off the uprights
could, just as Renwick says, have made a crucial difference. McKenzie,
with five successful kicks at goal, kept his side in the hunt when they
should have been dead and buried.
It would have been a travesty if, indeed, County had stolen the game
on the basis of McKenzie's goal kicking prowess but it would not have
been the first time, and certainly not the last, when a side has sneaked
an undeserved victory on the basis of a better goal kicking record.
With Harper injured again and Murray Fraser suspended, Stirling were
forced to field Fraser Kennedy, not long turned 17, in the scrumhalf
role. By necessity, the teenager played largely as a link man and the
advantage which accrues from keeping the opposition guessing -- in terms
of break, kick or pass -- was almost always lacking.
Welsh and McKenzie traded penalty goals in the first half hour before
Hawick edged into the lead with another Welsh penalty goal and the first
of his tries.
Four minutes from the interval, the fly-half broke from the Stirling
22 and danced through the gaps for the try which he also converted.
McKenzie clawed Stirling back into contention with a penalty goal but in
injury time Welsh again punished slack defence with his second try which
he goaled to give Hawick a 20-6 advantage at the turn.
McKenzie narrowed the gap with his third successful penalty effort but
Welsh maintained a respectable margin with another penalty of his own.
Two more penalties from McKenzie -- and two costly misses -- were all
that Stirling had to show from a second half performance in which they
had managed to keep Hawick in check -- a Craig Sangster tackle on Allott
being noteworthy -- but there was never even the slightest of hint that
they would do enough to make the game their own.

Edinburgh Academicals 19, Boroughmuir 35
BOROUGHMUIR'S margin of four tries to one was conclusive enough in
gorgeous conditions at a well attended Raeburn Place but Edinburgh
Academicals gave a splendid account of themselves until suffering the
loss of their chief strategist, Brian Hay-Smith, after 58 minutes.
Thereafter Boroughmuir went up a gear and, although cut back to 23-16
by a try from Murray Waite, they finished the stronger with the
coup-de-grace a quality score from Derek Stark.
The growing lineout authority of Scott Murray when allied to a steady
scrummage as well as David McIvor's abrasive example and high grade
utility from Waite gave Academicals a platform and with Hay-Smith
ringing the changes and landing two penalty goals and a drop goal,
Academicals were in 9-9 contention at the interval.
Their ball retention at stoppage points, however, were subject to
frailty against one of the best pirating packs in the business. And
there was snappy ball transferance and running angles by the experienced
Boroughmuir backs that their revivals couldn't match.
Another Boroughmuir feature was the work appetite of their capped
wings Iwan Tukalo and Stark, who frequently materialised in support
action on the opposite flank. Thus Tukalo had opportunity for
demonstrating his sidestep and Stark must have impressed the watching
Jim Telfer, Douglas Morgan, and Arthur Hastie although once he did not
feel an overlap to the captain of the day David Laird.
Boroughmuir's pack weren't permitted to roll off mauls in their usual
devastating fashion but Darren George demonstrated versatility and
Fergus Wallace, deputising for the injured Stuart Reid, chalked up
several pluses, especially with a try almost in replica of the one he
scored for Scotland A against the Springboks a year ago, the scoring
pass this time delivered by Macrae. Bryan Easson had a good day with his
boot out of hand as well as for three penalty goals and three
conversions out of four. He owes much to his aggressive partner, Graeme
Beveridge, who is building up quite a repertoire that includes asking
frequent questions of opposing fringers as he did with a low scoring
dive in wake of a scrummage push over threat. The other Boroughmuir try
was owed to Stark, a penalty try when he was obstructed by Simon Burns
following his own chip ahead.
In Hay-Smith's absence, Ross Barber took over the place kicking duties
and hit two beauties -- the conversion of Waite's try after Burns had
kicked ahead and forced a five metre scrummage and a penalty goal. But
Stark's late score underlined much of the trend -- Easson's penalty
attempt rebounded from the upright, Barber decided to run it but his
link to Burns faultered and when Boroughmuir repossessed, Easson's huge
mispass enabled Wallace to send Stark purring home.

HAMMY MCMILLAN and his Stranraer team of Roger McIntyre, Mike Hay, and
Norman Brown won the opening major curling event of the season, The
Lockerbie Invitation, by beating Crawford Copstick of Glasgow by 9-4 in
yesterday afternoon's final.
In winning yesterday, McMillan immediately gathered 32 points to put
himself and his team at the top of The Curlers Association Order of
Merit, a familiar place for the Stranraer team, who were last year's
overall winners of that title.
McMillan will also take some satisfaction from the fact that this
weekend's victory shows he is in good early season form, with the all
important European Play-Downs taking place in Hamilton next week, at
which Scotland's representatives in this year's European Championships
will be determined.
To reach yesterday's final, McMillan beat John Muir's team from
Hamilton, while Crawford Copstick overcame Glasgow's Peter de Boer in
his semi-final.
However, the Stranraer team were beaten 4-3 by a local quartet led by
Craig Wilson. This relegated them to the ''B'' road but in the end
proved to be their only slip up.

Hearts 4 Raith Rovers 2
IF THEY needed any ego resuscitation after their fitful performance at
Tynecastle, as they approach their destiny with Bayern Munich, Rovers
received it from an unlikely source. John Robertson, one of the most
influential Hearts men in their defeat of the Fifers, offered his own
articulate opinion that Raith might surprise the mighty Germans in the
UEFA Cup, first-leg tie tomorrow.
Robertson, who played against Bayern six years ago when Hearts beat
them in Edinburgh but went out narrowly on aggregate, believes the
Kirkcaldy side will be much more formidable at Easter Road than they
were at the weekend. He will have to be right, or it could be an
embarrassing evening.
''Raith will be up for that one all right,'' said Robertson,
''although I didn't think they played badly against us. They weren't as
committed as they might have been in other circumstances maybe, but it
is hard for players when they know a game as big as that is coming up.''
Robertson felt the Fife club would have been wise to take the tie to
Tynecastle simply for the psychological benefit of reminding Bayern
where they lost before, but he acknowledges that the Easter Road slope
may let the Rovers feel at home -- Stark's Park has a very similar
descent.
''Raith will make sure that Bayern don't get time to play and big Ally
Graham could give the Germans problems. The Raith defenders, too, will
close people down much quicker than they did against us.''
Jimmy Nicholl and his players will absorb those words and, hopefully,
fulfil their promise, but it is certain that between now and then, the
manager will have let his merry band of men know in basic language what
he thought of their show at Tynecastle. Before he whisked them off into
the evening, he said only a few words but they were revealing enough of
his feelings. ''We were shocking and that has given us food for thought
over the weekend.'' Asked if anybody was injured, he replied: ''You
don't get injured if you don't tackle.''
In essence, that summed up his team's display, especially in the first
half, when it seemed as though the Fifers were working on automatic
pilot.
Much of this might be read as if Hearts were gifted the points, but
that would be unfair on Jim Jefferies' side, who took advantage of their
chances in the first half and then, when Raith did get their act
together after the break, responded by raising their own game and
winning through in style.
Robertson reckoned that was as much due to the manager's state of the
art treatise before the game began at all. Jefferies himself admitted
that he had decided to give them a row before they set foot on the park.
''That's just what he did,'' said Robertson, ''gave us a rollicking
before we began. He told us there were two new faces in the dressing
room and unless we got our act together, there would be more.''
Goalkeeper Gary O'Connor and midfield man John Millar must have
wondered if they had any future at Tynecastle after Jefferies was
involved in talks aiming to bring St Johnstone's keeper, Andy Rhodes, to
Hearts, with Millar one of the men wanted by Saints.
''Millar was not one I had suggested but you have to come and go a bit
in these deals,'' said Jefferies, ''but when the lad said he did not
want to go, then that suited me fine, but maybe others will get a jolt
as well by what is going on. Gary did everything right.''
Hearts had slipped into the lead when Millar headed in at the near
post from Gary Locke's cross, and then Alan Lawrence headed in the
second following further dithering in the Rovers defence. Raith gave
themselves a lift when Ally Graham scored after the break, but their
threatened recovery was doused by Robertson's goal and then Lawrence's
second, before Steve Crawford reduced the gap to two again.

Falkirk 0, Kilmarnock 2
THERE will be no hiding place at Brockville this week for players who
''threw in the towel'' on Saturday, leaving Falkirk in bottom place,
five points adrift.
The honeymoon since manager John Lambie's arrival from Firhill is
over. His judgement was that too many players are prima donnas, do not
want the ball, and lack pride.
He promised change in personnel and attitude -- a back to basics, with
effort and determination topping the agenda.
Ironically, Lambie had praised the team's attitude and application in
the match programme. But he could not forgive the second half display,
with only Mo Johnston and David Hagen on his debut emerging with credit
against fellow strugglers Kilmarnock.
Lambie will now look at fringe players to provide ''dig,'' and hinted
of a buy because Falkirk lack a ''general''.
Chairman George Fulston who spent 10 minutes with barracking fans at
the end, said money is available. Fulston conceded Falkirk was ''not
putting it together'' and added ''no-one is more frustrated than me.''
Yet, given chances created, the Bairns could have been ahead at the
interval instead of two goals down to clinical finishing, the main
difference between the sides.
It was a scintillating 45 minutes, even better than the pre-match
relegation struggle hype.
Kilmarnock keeper Dragoje Lekovic was the busier, with two saves from
David Elliot, who also hit a post in 27 minutes; Johnston and Steve Kirk
also went close.
However, Falkirk often failed to get forward in numbers, while their
flawed offside trap always made Kilmarnock look likelier to score.
Just three minutes passed before the opener. Colin McKee -- who was to
get free repeatedly behind a tormented Tom Black -- crossed low into the
sixth yard box and past Billy Lamont for Ally Mitchell to drive home.
The second in 44 minutes was equally good, Mark Skilling cut back
across goal for Paul Wright to net.
The entertainment, frenetic but with Robert Connor and Tom Brown
providing the guile, ended in 53 minutes when scorer Mitchell was sent
off for verbal abuse of the standside linesman.
Kilmarnock's open, attacking game disappeared -- as, inexplicably, did
Falkirk's fighting spirit.
Mitchell's foolishness will be severely disciplined, subject to the
referee's report. Manager Alex Totten was clearly upset at not being
able to field the same side for five games in a row against Celtic on
Saturday.
His emotions paled when compared with Lambie, haunted by the
simplicity of the goals, the lack of fire, and a failure to score.
Lambie's injury depleted squad has been further diluted with the loss
of Derek Ferguson in 53 minutes. The midfielder went to hospital for
x-rays on an ankle injury. Five others were booked.

Motherwell 2, Aberdeen 1
SUDDENLY at Fir Park it was Spring. In the middle of October, there
was May sunshine. Making for more unseasonable confusion was how both
teams responded as if it were last Spring.
Motherwell recovered the splendour and swank they then had, while
Aberdeen reverted to the meek and worried mood of their previous dire
championship.
They were a shadow of the shape they have been in since August.
If it wasn't the weather that did it, there seemed to be no other
explanation.
''It was our worst performance of the season,'' Roy Aitken, the
Aberdeen manager, said. He did not sound downhearted; in fact, almost
buoyant. It was as if what he had witnessed could not be so bad again.
Alex McLeish, the Motherwell manager, seemed also content to let the
surface excitement of his team's exhilarating performance be enjoyed for
its own sake.
He mused: ''We probably surprised them a wee bit by the way we
played.''
About the middle of the first half, the surprise came all the other
way. When Aberdeen scored first, it was with a goal so simple it felt
too complex to analyse, or even describe. It's suddenness stunned the
mind.
Reeling the making of it through what faint traces it left on the
memory bank suggests that a long kick-out from goal came off the back of
the head of Miodrag Krivokapic like a bingo ball. Luck landed it at the
feet of Scott Booth.
So much on his own was he that he must have felt like the last man on
earth. He was monarch of all he surveyed. Coolly, he enjoyed his
Robinson Crusoe moment to hook in the opener.
It was an even odder goal for how it seemed hardly to count.
Motherwell were not put off their stride, which had been thoroughly
outpacing that ofAberdeen.
Motherwell declined to treat the blow as if the Saints were against
them. It was just the gods being playful before they allowed inevitable
justice to be done.
''Even then, we felt it was just a matter of time before we scored,''
said Paul Lambert, whose midfield work with Billy Davies and Jamie Dolan
dominated the match.
A quick ploy with a free kick that suggested much scheming rehearsal
by Davies and Tommy Coyne brought Motherwell's equaliser before the
interval, when Coyne scored from an angle so acute it seemed to defy
geometry.
With Aberdeen temporarily a man short because of an injury to Colin
Woodthorpe, the winner came off a post from Lambert after a probing run
by Davies.
Motherwell were staunchly served by Krivokapic who had his first
appearance since the Spring (the real one) and by Rob McKinnon who made
abundant use of the abundant space he was given in the early stages.
Along with the bouncy Dougie Arnott, he had his contribution cut short
by injury.
Like many other famous victories, this might be an expensive one
before wintry Saturdays come along as, presumably, they will.

Celtic 2, Hibernian 2.
IT'S little wonder that Liverpool striker Ian Rush has come into
Celtic's thoughts in recent weeks.
In this game, Rush would have helped himself to a hat trick, and the
Parkhead team would not have dropped the two points which saw them lose
a little more ground to Rangers at the top of the premier division.
Celtic manager Tommy Burns was happy with the way the team played,
delighted by the passing movements which saw them set up so many
openings, but he was disappointed with his side's finishing and with the
result.
He did say: ''When you play as well as we did today, then you do
expect to win the game. But I was thrilled by the way we played, and I
am very happy at the way the young players are settling in.
''There is a way we want to play football at Celtic Park and once we
can add goals to our outfield play, then you will be looking at that
style.
''It took Celtic Football Club a long time to get into the mess it was
in, and it will take time to get the club back to where it was. But we
are getting there.''
There is little doubt that Burns is pursuing an attacking,
entertaining policy which has long been the trade mark of Celtic teams
down through the years. The passing movements can, at times, match those
of the very best Celtic teams I have watched.
What they lack is a penalty box player in the mould of Rush or, if you
are a Celtic supporter and can cast your mind back far enough, someone
such as Joe McBride.
Burns, though, knows that that type of player is not easy to get,
though he admitted after this game that the search will go on.
In other areas, too, Celtic lack a little. There is a lack of
composure on occasions at the centre of the defence, where Brian O'Neil
has been a huge loss this season.
The youngster would have added that European look to the heart of the
back line just as he did so successfully towards the end of last season
before he was cruelly injured on the run-up to the Scottish Cup Final.
But in Simon Donnelly, they have a re-born star, and Burns was quick
to point out after the game that the youngster had shown international
class against Hibs.
Donnelly would not talk too much about his manager's praise clearly
intent on proving himself on the field instead of facing the Press.
But he did add: ''I am still learning my trade to some extent, and I
am just happy to be back in the side. I didn't think I played too well
in the first half. And we are still missing too many goal chances, which
is disappointing for all of us.
''We lost two points today which we should not have done and, really,
we don't want to let Rangers get too far ahead of us. We have had a
better start to the season than last year, and we have to try to keep
that going.''
Former Celt Pat McGinlay, who returned to face his old club as a Hibs'
player, said after the draw: ''You are always liable to get chances
against Celtic.
''It's the way they always play. They have that cavalier thing, going
forward as often as possible, and so we thought that we would have a
chance to snatch something. I am certain they will be challenging
Rangers for the title this year.
''The Cup win must have helped their confidence, and they have added
some good players since I left.''
What is needed now, of course, is not necessarily a good player. Just
a good finisher. A man who will punish opposing defenders in their
penalty box, who will live on the service which Andreas Thoms can always
provide.
At the moment, his explosive pace is destroying men who are deployed
to mark him, but the end product remains total frustration too often.
This game was close to being a copy-book display from Burns' men. They
attacked at the start, had most of the game, then lost a goal.
They fought back, equalised, went in front in the second half, missed
half-a-dozen opportunities, and were then cuaght by a Hibs' breakaway
towards the end when they had little time to mount another comeback.
How often have we seen this? How often have Celtic been punished when
they should have been celebrating victory?
The answer, naturally, is too often.
For the record Kevin Harper scored Hibs' opening goal after Gordon
Marshall fumbled a corner from Kevin McAllister in 28 minutes.
Three minutes later, a classic John Collins' free kick had them level
and the game remained that way until Pierre van Hooydonk eventually took
one of his many chances to score in 66 minutes.
Then came the penalty for Hibs which Darren Jackson sent past Marshall
with all the confidence he had shown in a similar situation at Ibrox
three weeks back.
As Burns lamented later: ''Two individual errors let us down today,
and there is nothing we can do about them now.''

IT was perhaps the last summer of unflinching fun. The snapshot on the
bookshelf hints at that. A day of sunlit happiness in the garden of a
prosperous merchant, the mother pretty in lightweight clothes, with
Hugo, the eldest child, still in short trousers while Gaby, his brother,
wears dungarees and sandals.
Beside the little group stands Geza Gryn, the father, one hand resting
on a wicker chair, the other on Gaby's shoulder. In its way that
photograph's survival is a miracle, for it is 1941 and within a few
years all but one figure in it will have perished. Today it rests in a
modest plastic frame in Hugo Gryn's rabbinical office, a grainy shadow
keeping the dead alive but defying the racist's intermittent jeer which
damns the Holocaust as Jewish propaganda.
By his voice many of us know Rabbi Gryn, a deep, rumpled sort of
voice, warm and humorous with Yiddish intonation, and often the only
voice of vulnerability and doubt among the fluent certainties of his
fellow panellists on Radio 4's The Moral Maze.
Later today, when America's black Muslim activist, Louis Farrakhan,
leads his Million Man procession through Washington, Gryn will be in his
West London Synagogue, observing the Jewish holy day of Simchat Torah, a
feast rejoicing in God's Law. But Farrakhan's captivating oratory will
not escape him. He will hear it attentively, listening with dread for
any echo of the hatred which so convulsed his world half-a-century ago.
Farrakhan, a former New York calypso singer who leads the Nation of
Islam sect, may claim his march also symbolises a holy day, an occasion
of ''atonement for wrongs committed by black males within their families
and their neighbourhoods''. But Gryn, like millions of others, remembers
Farrakhan's relish of ethnic scapegoats, his words branding them to
bloat his own personal power. This is the man who once called Hitler
''great'', the man for whom Judaism is ''a gutter religion'', and whose
psalms of poison contain the refrain: ''Little Jews died while big Jews
made money.'' Compared with the oppression of black America, says
Farrakhan, the Holocaust was nothing.
The evidence of Farrakhan's calumny rests on that bookshelf. Beneath
the surface of Gryn's treasured photograph there are at least six
million horror stories which cannot be denied, and yet there are moments
when genocide seems to have taught us nothing. ''Louis Farrakhan is the
most vicious anti-Semite'' says Gryn. ''He is revolting, obscene, the
proof that hatred is still having a good run for its money.'' The rabbi
is physically distressed by the very mention of the other's name.
Gryn was born in 1930 in the thriving Czechoslovak town of Berehova
where his father was a wealthy forest developer and where Judaism was so
much the fabric of life, children learned Hebrew before Czech. For more
than 30 years he has been at the West London Synagogue and is a
co-chairman of the Interfaith Network which encourages theological
debate among different religions. But when he arrived in Britain, at the
age of 16, he worked in all manner of jobs, later studying mathematics
and biochemistry at Cambridge.
By the time the war had ended the eldest Gryn son was a veteran of
Auschwitz. For two years he and his father had somehow managed to give
death the slip, but three days after they were liberated Geza Gryn died
of emaciation. His mother, who also survived the camps and made it back
to Berehova, died later, but Gaby, aged 11 when the SS rounded up the
family, had been herded into the gas chambers immediately. ''He went
that way, along with my grandparents. Gassed, then burned.''
Gryn speaks these words almost with serenity. They are facts and he
has had 50 years to bear the pain and weight of them. ''By the time
Nazism was defeated I wasn't sure of anything anymore, except that I
believed that when the world came to realise the grotesque nature of
what had happened it would never let racism occur again.
''Yet how pathetic that you and I sit here, realising my one certainty
was wrong. And you ask: 'Well, why did God create such hatred of others,
such evil?' All I can say is what the medieval Jewish philosopher might
have said: If I knew why God created evil, I would be God.''
But in the death camps did Gryn never resent the religion for which he
was suffering? ''At Auschwitz the question was not: where is God? but:
where is man? Don't forget that before Nazism there had been decency in
our lives. There was civilisation and purity in the world of my
childhood. It was very beautiful, and it was destroyed not by sinfulness
but by sinners who came -- like barbarians always do -- from outside to
wreak havoc.''
By autumn 1938 the first Jewish laws in Eastern Europe were slyly
paving the route to the death camps. In Berehova the best secondary
school introduced a 3% Jewish quota, and Gryn reflects that although he
should have been pleased to gain a place there, he could not bear the
prospect of being one of only three Jews surrounded by such overwhelming
mockery. The alternative was a Jewish boarding school in Hungary, whose
rigorous tuition in self-sufficiency would later become like stepping
stones to his survival.
Then one day, when the child was home on holiday, the SS arrived at
his parents' door. By nightfall he and all Berehova's Jews had been
thrown into a crowded train destined for an unknown place called
Auschwitz. ''As we arrived, an old man whispered to me: 'Say you're 18
and have a trade.' His advice saved my life. I lied and, with my father,
I was put to work as a carpenter.'' Against all the odds the father and
son were never separated, an act of providence, says Gryn, which also
steeled endurance.
''My father would paraphrase a Jewish prayer, telling me: 'You cannot
live three minutes without help'.'' Gryn still believes it, despite the
monstrous evidence of newer ethnic cleansing, and the likes of
Farrakhan's incendiary coaxings.
''Every day I read somewhere that parents and elders have lost hope
for the future of their children, but I don't accept it. To be hopeless
is to be dead. In my tradition there is the notion of the impulse to
good and the impulse to evil, the Yetzer Ha' Tov and the Yetzer Ha'rah,
and we tell a story about a certain rabbi who asked God to banish the
evil impulse, which he did. But next morning everyone overslept. The
cocks did not crow, the cows gave no milk. People became indifferent to
one another; a man would pass a woman in the street without looking, a
woman would do the same. And the rabbi realised what a disaster had been
created crying: 'God, put it back, put it back.'
''You see, without the existence of evil you lose moral liability. The
two impulses are in every one of us. It is a question of which you allow
to dominate.'' So, there at least is one explanation of evil.
Gryn downplays the Jewish gift of over-stating sensitivity, believing
his race should now be psychologically free of the victim business.
''I used to think there was something commendable about people moving
through history and remaining reasonably civilised without power. But
what happened in the twentieth century forcibly convinced us that you
cannot live without power. It is dangerous. Of course, it's true that
power corrupts, but in my opinion the test of morality is what you do
when you have power. When you don't have it morality isn't challenged
that much.''
Appalled by what he calls the official hardening of Britain's caring
arteries, Gryn is one of those religious leaders who stays close to the
troubled pulse and heartaches of the faithful. ''When I perceive that
someone is trying to justify this hardening I become incensed. In my
tradition the great sin was worship of the golden calf, and I tell you
that idolatory hasn't gone away. It just reappears in different
guises.''
Gryn wasn't raised to think of his future as a rabbi. ''We didn't have
that kind of death wish in my family,'' he jokes. But orphaned and
tentatively piecing together a new life in London, he took to studying
Judaism with a very distinguished old scholar. ''I would say to him:
'Rabbi, there are only two true Hebrew specialists left in the world,
you and me, and I'm not so sure about you.' As you can see, I was very
arrogant but the old man took it, and then one day he'd had enough: 'Why
don't you put your money where your mouth is?' he said. 'What's stopping
you from becoming a rabbi?' So I was bluffed into it.''
Gryn's vocal use of language provides The Moral Maze with some of its
most electrifying moments. Earlier this year he challenged a National
Front member to look at him as the man defended his pernicious creed.
''I did manage to make him lift his eyes,'' he recalls. ''But I don't
think it had much effect on him.''
Part of that particular programme's discussion had concerned the slain
black schoolboy, Stephen Lawrence, whose parents are now pursuing
England's first private prosecution for murder. ''I am not given to
weeping easily but when I saw the dignity and compassion of that young
couple whose bright, clever son had been kllled, I cried. I hope none of
the listeners knew this.''
As the parents left the studio Gryn followed out of a ''humble need''
to hug them. That is the man. The very breath was nearly trampled out of
him on that final death march to Berlin, but not emotion.
TODAY when he talks of racism's come back he asks: ''Who gave the
National Front the right to attack us, or any ethnic group?'' And yet
even in ugly circumstances Gryn's faith in hope has brought rewards.
From a bulging file he produces a letter from a lapsed member of the
British National Front, but before he reads it there comes another
anecdote:
''Some years ago I was going to a seminar about whether or not we
should try old war criminals. As I was getting out of the taxi the
driver said: 'You have a reception committee.' Outside the Westminster
hotel National Front yobbos were gathered, with placards saying:
Holocaust, a Jewish Lie, and Hoax of the Twentieth Century.
''Then a young man came up to me and started shouting obscenities. I
couldn't help it, I saw red and grabbed him, demanding: 'How can you be
so obscene?' Next thing my picture appeared in several newspapers, and I
am ashamed of myself because this is not a nice image for a rabbi.''
So, where hides hope in all of this? Gryn refers back to the letter.
''Several years later I received this, an apology from the young man who
confronted me on the steps, and now regretted his involvement with the
BNF.'' And today, if Hugo Gryn were to hear Louis Farrakhan speak of
real reconciliation between races then, despite all the world's
accumulating tragedies, he would know he had struck lucky with hope
again.
He looks at the photograph on the bookshelf and those of others around
the room whose smiles were ripped away by Auschwitz, and slowly he
describes a sequence of powerful recollections. ''We were under
Hungarian domination at the time and I was home from school for the
holidays. There was a discussion and my father told us that because
things were very unsettled, very unpleasant, he had arranged for us to
have passports and permits to go to Turkey.
'' 'Don't tell anyone about this.' he said. 'It might happen at very
short notice while you are at school, and if so, we will just call by
casually and collect you as you are'.'' But months went by and nothing
happened. Their only journey was the one forced upon them by the SS.
''Now it is December 1944, and my father and I are on the death march.
We are all so emaciated that of the 35,000 who set out only 800 make it,
and for every five of us there is an SS guard with a gun. Among the
fleets of lorries which whiz by, covering us with mud and slush, there
is a very distinctive yellow one which has the name Geza Gryn on the
side. Lo and behold, it is one of my father's trucks which had been
commandeered, and it splashes us.'' So overcome by the callous contrast
of that experience, the younger Gryn turned to his dying father and, for
the first time, asked: ''How come we never went to Turkey?''
Everything had been in place, his father told him. He had even made
the reservations, and on the Sunday before the family was to leave, Geza
Gryn and his wife went to say their secret farewells to their parents.
''Then, they returned to our house in Berehova, and they looked at each
other. 'How can we leave our parents behind?' they said, 'and our
brothers and sisters? We cannot do it'.''
Fifty years later that image remains the son's strongest vision of his
father. And his parents' tragic honour, like that of so many other
millions, makes him curiously optimistic. He is far too wise a man to
say for sure where truth resides, but in a full life Hugo Gryn has
potent memories of places where he's glimpsed it.
A reward of faith in hope: the apology to Rabbi Gryn.

WALTER Smith took his final look at Italian champions Juventus before
finalising his plans for the Champions' League match in Turin on
Wednesday night, and although his squad is ravaged by injury and
suspension, the Rangers manager did leave Milan last night with his mind
a little more at ease.
He knows it could have been much worse. He could have been preparing
to play AC Milan in their remarkable San Siro Stadium.
The Milan side dominated much of yesterday's match, watched by 83,000
of the football business's most passionate fans, and Smith's dossier on
Juventus was completed with the addition of one or two points of
weakness identified in their 2-1 defeat.
Although Smith, who was accompanied by his right-hand man, Archie
Knox, was particularly interested in the manner in which Milan were able
to open up and stretch the Juventus defence, he knows that Wednesday
night's match will be one of the most difficult his side have ever
faced. Then again, he was aware of that when injury denied him the
services of Brian Laudrup, Paul Gascoigne, Charlie Miller, and Ian
Ferguson, and he will also be without one of his central defenders, the
suspended Alan McLaren.
Before leaving Milan, Smith said that Craig Moore, Rangers'
19-year-old Australian defender, would probably take the place of
McLaren. It seems a bold move by the Ibrox club's manager, but he is
convinced that the teenager will be able to acquit himself well. ''He
has a great temperament and he will not be overawed playing against
Juventus on Wednesday,'' he said.
''Centre half is his natural position, although I have used him mostly
at full back and in midfield. He is mobile and clever, although his
aggressive style of play tends to earn him more bookings than any of us
would wish.''
One of the players Moore will have to look after, Fabrizio Ravanelli,
hobbled off the pitch seven minutes into the second half complaining
about a groin injury. Gianluca Vialli also left the pitch at the same
time and, after the match, Juventus manager Marcello Lippi said
Ravanelli's state of health would be checked in the morning.
Smith said: ''Obviously, if Ravanelli had to be left out that would be
a benefit to us, but I don't think we can read too much into what took
place in the San Siro today, because Juventus were caught by two early
goals and they took time to force their way back into the game.
''Besides, we have seen them enough to realise that they are an
excellent team. Teams with glaring weaknesses or ordinary players do not
win the Italian championship.''
Rangers will set out for Turin tomorrow morning and the state of play
in the Champions' League Group C is that the Ibrox side will be looking
to take a point from this match, although it would not be the absolute
end if they failed to do so. They will play Juventus two weeks later in
Glasgow and they have also to meet Steaua Bucharest at Ibrox before
going to Germany for the return match against Borussia Dortmund, and
much will depend on those three games.
''It would be good, nevertheless, for us to go to Turin and put on
some kind of performance, especially with the injury problems we have,''
said Smith, who, along with Knox, ran into some problems at the San
Siro. They had difficulty getting through the crowds, and when they
managed to enter the stadium, they then discovered they had no seats.
Rangers' management team studied the match from perches on the
stairway leading up to the press gallery, but they won't be allowed into
those places until they have retired and joined one of the various media
organisations. Old footballers and managers don't take their leave
quietly these days -- they merely pick up pens and notebooks or
microphones.
The treatment of Smith and Knox was shoddy and Milan ought to have
made sure their visit was much more comfortable. It isn't as though
Smith is without problems going into a match which will test his
tactical awareness and resilience.
''Despite the difficulties with players who are injured and McLaren's
suspension I am looking forward to the challenge on Wednesday night,''
Smith said. ''These are games that we should all enjoy and with a fair
share of luck we will.''
Juventus didn't enjoy yesterday's experience, falling behind after
only seven minutes, when Marco Simone scored with a free kick from 22
yards. The foul had been conceded when Alessio Tacchinardi impeded the
progress of the wonderfully gifted George Weah.
Milan scored again in 14 minutes when Weah offered an astonishing
glimpse of his skills as he skipped away from Ciro Ferrara and then left
Pietro Vierchowod for dead. Having embarrassed both defenders, Weah then
flicked the ball into the net with the outside of his right foot.
For all of the remainder of the first half, and a large part of the
second, Milan were finding it easy to subdue their opponents, who were
trying to increase their own pace. But with Vialli and Ravanelli both
off, it looked as though they would have to settle for being a poor
second best.
However, Alessandro Del Piero, who seemed to function better on his
own, scored in 81 minutes and Milan finished the match hanging on
desperately. In fact, Del Piero delivered a cross left to right in the
dying seconds and Sergio Porrini, a second-half substitute for Didier
Deschamps, ought to have scored with his header.
Unfortunately for him, he nodded the ball wide while he himself ended
up in the net. A few seconds later it was all over and Milan's fans
again came alive all around the stadium, which became a mass of colour
and noise. Firecrackers and red flares were sent off and the steep
slopes of the San Siro rippled with the red and black.
As Smith left, Joe Jordan, the former Scottish internationalist, came
down from his eyrie, where he had been commentating on the match for
Channel 4. Jordan, of course, played for Milan for two years and he
remains something of a hero around these parts. Before he could leave he
was obliged to scroll his signature on programmes, business cards, and
pieces of scrap paper.
The Italian fans are nothing if not committed, as Rangers will
probably discover for themselves come Wednesday in the Delle Alpi
Stadium. It will be a major test of the players and fans.

CELTIC'S Cup-winners' Cup opponents Paris St Germain have hit a crisis
of confidence. And the frustration of their notorious support turned
ugly at the weekend as trouble flared during the goalless draw in Lyon.
Riot police were forced to intervene as hundreds of Parisian fans
threw firecrackers at Lyon supporters and fought with stewards. It was a
timely warning to the 3000 Celtic fans due to arrive in midweek.
PSG have now gone three matches without a win since the European draw
was made, and their latest setback came against 10 men after the Lyon
goalkeeper, Pascal Olmeta, was red-carded early on.
Olmeta had pulled down temperamental Parisian striker, Patrice Loko,
as he raced into a scoring position.
For Saturday night's game, manager Luis Fernandez brought back two of
his biggest stars in an effort to pep up his flagging side.
Brazilian World Cup-winning captain, Rai, returned after a five-match
absence with a thigh injury, but he lacked the sharpness which had
brought him six goals in his best start in three seasons at the club.
The midfielder lost his footing on several occasions and also missed a
golden opportunity with a header late on.
Also back, after having missed four games, was French No.1 goalkeeper
Bernard Lama, whose spectacular saves were integral to his side's
effervescent run to the Champions' League semi-finals in the spring.
PSG have now slipped six points behind leaders Metz, and Lama admits
they have problems. ''The team has lost its free spirit, its sense of
artistry which made our name,'' said the 32-year-old. ''We're having a
hard time trying to regain our confidence out there.
''Our concentration has gone as a result, and sometimes we don't seem
to know where we are any more.
''I made a couple of mistakes myself in pass-back situations, but
fortunately these weren't serious. I just hope Thursday's game turns out
to be the detonator for us.''
Lama also admits PSG are stepping into the unknown against Celtic and
that Tommy Burns' men are unlikely to find themselves in a better
position to pull off a major European upset.
''To be honest, we don't hear much about Celtic over here,'' he went
on, ''all we here about from Scotland is Glasgow Rangers.
''But Celtic won't be asking any questions of themselves. I know that,
because I've played opposite Pat Bonner and against Pierre van Hooydonk
for Holland.''
However, Billy Stark and Davie Hay, who watched the game, may want the
likes of Andreas Thom to ask a question or two, particularly of PSG
sweeper Bruno N'gotty, who is still struggling to settle since his
summer move from Lyon.

IT is not politically correct to say or even imply that the small
investor is an expensive nuisance.
To be fair the Stock Exchange was not really saying that recently when
it announced changes to its Yellow Book of listing rules. But it came
close, saying it in respect of one segment of its activities. This is
new issues of shares in companies seeking a market quotation.
A revision to the rules -- passed by the Stock Exchange Board and due
to come into force in January -- says that companies will no longer be
required to make a public offer or even a placing with brokers and
financial intermediaries who act for small investors.
From next year the big merchant banks and big company stockbrokers
will be free to place the new arrival's shares with the big
institutional investors and not bother with anyone else.
Comments suggesting that this is big boys scratching each other's
backs or looking for the easiest ways to get the shares away would
simply be in bad taste. Listen instead to what people who contacted the
exchange to comment on the proposed rule changes had to say.
They complained that there was a ''high level'' of sales by private
investors to the institutions as soon as dealing started. They also
argued that public offerings had to be under-priced ''for no reason
other than to generate a sufficient level of interest among private
investors''.
The effect was to increase the cost of capital to companies and the
logical thing was to abolish the rule which said private investors had
to have a certain percentage of each offering.
Against that a ''very small number of respondents'' mainly ProShare
which campaigns for wider share ownership and APCIMS the Association of
Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers, argued the other
way. They wanted the public to have ''a better chance of participating
in initial public offers''.
Not every public offer is at a giveaway price. Investors even lose
money on some. But it was unfortunate to say the least that, at the same
time as the Stock Exchange was saying small investors could be locked
out of new issues, the Bank of England was proposing that they should
pay more for dealing in companies already on the market.
This is the likely result of the charges proposed by Crest, the new
computerised settlement system being organised under the leadership of
the Bank. Deals involving under #4000 which currently account for 60% of
private client activity are scheduled to cost more.
The Crest charges will be paid by the broker but when a deal involving
less than #1000 for a client who wants to have a share certificate
rather than a note saying his name will appear on the share register is
due to rise from 75p to over #2 the client may well have to pay more.
The subject of the small investor is one which normally gets delicate
and sensitive treatment -- you walk as if on egg shells and do not crash
about in hobnailed boots. There are, after all 11 million of them. So
there is now something of a damage limitation exercise going on.
Mr Michael Lawrence, Chief Executive of the Stock Exchange whose job
is not simply to see that the place runs efficiently but also to ensure
that it survives in an increasingly danagerous world steps forward to
say: ''We have a duty to promote and encourage wider share ownership.''
He set up a committee under the chairmanship of Sir Mark Weinberg to
undertake a ''full review'' of how that should be achieved. Its terms of
reference include taking another look at initial public offerings and
nthe implications of Crest plus other interesting subjects such as
taxes, dealing costs, and share marketing.
Work is only now starting but this is a committee which could have
some far-reaching effects.
Meantime Mr Justin Urquhart Stewart of Barclays Stockbrokers suggests
that companies should continue to offer shares widely when they obtain a
listing. This is partly because shareholders can be seen as ''affinity
groups''for marketing but also because the small shareholder is
traditionally loyal. He also disputes the notion that small investors
always snatch a quick profit on a company flotation.
At APCIMS Mr Geoffrey Turner recalled that Mr Eddie George, Governor
of the Bank of England had said he saw ''no reason why the client who
wants to keep the share certificate should pay more''.
He said: ''We are disappointed that it seems this will indeed be more
expensive.'' APCIMS would be making representations.
Sir Mark's Committee on Private Share Ownership says it will consult
with private shareholders. Eleven million letters to it might work
wonders.

ON THE OTHER
OF SORROW
Nature and People in the Scottish Highlands
by Dr James Hunter
Mainstream: #17.50
DR JAMES Hunter, the Highland writer and historian, has now published
his latest work, On the Other Side of Sorrow: Nature and People in the
Scottish Highlands. An extraordinary intellectual voyage through our
history and literature it seeks to establish an indigenous tradition of
''green consciousness'' in the Highlands and Islands that stretches back
at least 1000 years before it could be detected in most of the rest of
Europe. A tradition that is too often ignored or patronised by many
modern environmentalists. His voyage is successful.
To an extent this is the book that we have been expecting from Hunter.
In 1992, in his Scottish Highlanders: A People and their Place, he put
down his marker: ''I do not mind greatly when folk from elsewhere tell
me, as they do from time to time, that Highlanders ought to be grateful
for the beauty of their surroundings. That can be construed, in one's
more charitable moments at any rate, as one of these slightly fumbled
but essentially well-meaning comments made by guests who, without
knowing quite how to go about it, think they should be paying a suitable
compliment to a locality which they have felt privileged to visit.
''What I do resent is any implication that Highlanders need to be
taught by others how to appreciate the Highlands. For close on 1500
years now, ever since the reciters of the Ulster sagas -- drawing,
perhaps, in Ireland on their knowledge of the Dalriada settlements --
caused Deirdre to lament so eloquently her departure from her Scottish
glen of steep-ridged peaks and pools and dappled deer and rowans and
hawks and round-faced otters, our literature has consisted very largely
of our efforts to explore the meaning of our place.''
His new work wrestles with the meaning of that place to Gaels in 1500
years of writing. It is the book that we expected, but last September
Hunter also published his most serious work of history since the Making
of the Crofting Community in 1976. This was A Dance Called America,
which dealt with the Highland diaspora in North America and changed our
thinking about the great emigrations of last century.
On the Other Side of Sorrow, words borrowed from the last line in
Sorley Maclean's great poem the Cuillin, is also enormously important to
Scottish/Highland self-awarness. It again underlines Hunter's status as
an outstanding modern champion of the Highland people. It challenges
those who claim to care about the Highlands to consider other views. As
a member of the North-West Regional Board of Scottish Natural Heritage
and chairman of Skye and Lochalsh Enterprise, he personally tries to
reconcile two.
From the verse composed by the monks of the Celtic church onwards
through the centuries to the modern writers and poets like Maclean, Neil
Gunn, Norman MacCaig, Hunter proves a concern for nature, for the
environment, deeply held by the Highland people. The Argyllshire poet,
Duncan Ban MacIntyre, has a special place for him, not least his Moladh
Beinn Dobhrain, In Praise of Ben Dorain.
On the first page of this work, having just sunk the boot into the
architecture of Tyndrum and Aviemore, Hunter writes: ''Many other
mountains have undoubtedly engendered every bit as much, and maybe more,
affection. But no hill has been so honoured by a poet as this one was by
Duncan MacIntyre. No hill has been so meticulously, so scrupulously, so
lovingly described. No hill has a better claim to be mentioned on the
opening page of a book intended to provide some insight into thinking
about the Highland landscape.''
But this is a book which will annoy many environmentalists. It deals
with the paradox that despite environmentalism's Highland roots,
Highlanders and environmentalists are now so often at odds. This, Dr
Hunter believes, resulted from the modern movement being subject to
other external infuences which has left its outlook wanting:
''Conservation organisations nowadays take for granted that the
Highlands are degraded ecologically. They are consequently committed . .
. to enhancing the region's biodiversity; to restoring its woodlands; to
assisting with the reintroduction of those birds and mammals which in
the Highlands anyway have long been extinct.
''The osprey and the sea eagle have already been reinstated. The
crane, the beaver, even the wolf could be brought back in the future,
but there is one species which environmentalists seem curiously
reluctant to have re-established in the numerous Highland localities
from which this species was expelled in the course of the nineteenth
century. The species is man.''
Dr Hunter finds an even more worrying attitude in the writings of
Dunbar-born John Muir, who was to pioneer the whole concept of
wilderness in North America. His view of those native North Americans
who were the original inhabitants of the Yosemite Valley, before Muir's
efforts saw it protected as a national park, was little short of racist.
In 1869 the great environmental hero's enjoyment of his own personal
Eden, was disturbed: ''Just then I was startled by a lot of queer,
hairy, muffled creatures coming shuffling, shambling, wallowing towards
me as if they had no bones in their bodies. Had I discovered them while
they were yet a good way off, I should have tried to avoid them . . .
The dirt on some of their faces seemed almost old enough to have a
geological significance . . . How glad I was to get away from the grey,
grim crowd and see them vanish down the trail.''
Jim Hunter accepts Muir's attitutes were far from unusual at that time
but the ''condescending way that Muir wrote about Yosemite's original
inhabitants is, for all that, most revealing. It is suggestive of the
problem which so many environmentalists have always had in accommodating
the claims of people who happen to live in places which the same
environmentalists deem special.''
The Other Side of Sorrow does not leave us without hope, however. Jim
Hunter believes environmentalists can work with local people. Although
confrontations between the two groups, be it over quarries, ski-ing or
geese, are covered in the rhetoric of warfare, not all wars have to end
in victory and defeat. Peace can come through negotiation. Former foes
can put disagreements behind them to pursue new and larger goals.
He calls for such co-operation between all those who care about the
Highlands; so that trees and people can return to our deserted and
degraded glens. He argues our landscape is not natural but man made at
the enormous human cost which moved the great Canadian writer, Hugh
MacLennan, to observe on his first visit to the Kintail his great
grand-father left in the 1830s: ''Above the 60th parallel in Canada you
feel that nobody but God has ever been there before you, but in a
deserted Highland glen you feel that everyone who ever mattered is dead
and gone.''
A single strategy for the ecological, social, and cultural
rehabilitation of the region is now needed and Hunter concludes: ''The
Highlands, if we were to attempt these things, would still be beautiful.
The Highlands would still offer anyone who wanted it the chance to be
alone in some wild corner. But the Highlands would also be a living
demonstration that community, culture, and nature can, after all, be
made compatible with one another. To accomplish this would be no small
achievement. It would help bring all humanity a little nearer to the
better-ordered world which Sorley's poem glimpses on the other side of
sorrow.''

POOR British Midland. The great champions of competition in the
airline business run panic-stricken to their lawyers at the first whiff
of a threat to their cosy existence at Glasgow Airport which together
with their bedfellows has ensured that London air fares are maintained
at levels which are a national disgrace.
The hysteria has been generated by two factors: the #59 price and the
free rail service directly to Prestwick Airport from anywhere in
Scotland.
With the huge interest shown so far in the Prestwick service, Scottish
travellers are showing that they need no longer tolerate over-priced air
fares from congested airports with no rail stations and expensive
car-parks.

Strathclyde Regional Councillor for Prestwick and North Ayr,

HEARD the one about the name for the European single currency? It will
be called the Delors. Why the Delors? Because it's worth 100 Santers, of
course. Poor old Jacques Santer. He has now a week in which to cool
tempers on the French nuclear testing issue and avoid an institutional
war inside the EU. At least you knew where you were with Mitterrand.
But what to do about Jacques Chirac? It's not enough for EU watchers
to take their cue from the old lady on the telly who rationalised Eric
Cantona's way with fans by shrugging: ''Well, he's French.'' Chirac
might look like an Ealing Studios butler but he is about as obsequious
as his footballing countryman on a trip to the terracing.
Chirac's brusque style with colleagues around the EU top table has
already caused some personal animosities. He offended the Swedes by
refusing to meet their Prime Minister after criticism in Stockholm of
French nuclear tests. He has baffled John Major by cosying up to
Britain's Tories on the veto issue only to back off again, and he has
frustrated Helmut Kohl by upsetting the money markets and talking with
forked tongue on integration.
In Majorca last month he irritated Felipe Gonzalez by sabotaging
Spain's carefully-structured informal discussion on nuclear tests.
Chirac suddenly demanded the presence of note-takers. The list of
offences lengthens daily.
Now that the EU is in disarray again on a range of issues it's not
difficult to trace the cause: Chirac.
Nothing matters more in Europe these days than protecting the kindred
spirit of France and Germany. It was easy with Kohl and Mitterrand, a
great double-act with the federalist Delors as their scriptwriter.
Euro-sceptics heaved a sigh of relief when Delors spurned a presidency
he would have won easily, allowing Chirac, carting years of Gaullist
baggage, to edge home.
His first act, you will recall, was a formal reaffirmation of France's
fraternity with Germany. A few months on and all is disarray.
In the background these days French and German diplomats are working
on a damage limitation exercise which will be presented as the usual
joint Franco-German approach to EU issues ahead of the Madrid summit.
But it hides a steadily worsening of relations between the community's
two bedrock member states.
Sharp differences have emerged between Chirac and Kohl. Kohl wants a
more powerful European Parliament. Chirac, with Major's support, does
not. Chirac demands the presence of the parliament in Strasbourg in
defiance of popular EU opinion which baulks at the expense of moving
monthly from Brussels for plenaries. But he also wants its powers
limited and real authority vested in the secretive Council of Ministers.
The Germans and various others, notably the Benelux members, want more
majority voting in the council on matters such as foreign policy. France
(again with British support) says Non. On immigration issues and asylum
there are also divisions between Germany and France.
Chirac was in office only briefly before reneging on the Shengen
accord under which most EU member states dismantled internal border
controls. He cited terrorism as the cause but most believe he was simply
behaving like an unreconstructed Gaullist nationalist and pandering to
French chauvinism. If so, it hasn't worked, as his freefall in the polls
shows.
But the latest dispute with Germany concerns the franc. France has
stubbornly high unemployment and a return to the old days of violence on
the streets is in prospect unless Chirac can start creating jobs.
His support in public for Mitterrand's franc-fort policy is the cause
of much of this disquiet. He is widely believed to have sounded out Kohl
on the chances of a competitive devaluation while complaining that the
pound and the lira -- both expelled from the exchange rate mechanism on
Black Wednesday, 1992 -- have gained unfair advantages over the
artificially strong franc.
Kohl is thought to have told Chirac to stick to the monetary rules.
Chirac desperately wants German economic power constrained by a single
currency. Both men know this cannot come about without French
participation. Kohl, in return, would abandon the D-mark for a Europe
based on the German constitutional model. Both Chirac and Kohl know a
Europe dominated by France and Germany would stop others ganging up on
them for ever.  And so the unhappy show moves unsteadily towards Madrid.
It will be interesting to see if Kohl and Chirac can put on a convincing
display of harmony -- but more interesting to see how long it takes for
Chirac to change his mind again when he takes one of his huffs.

rounds up some
holiday ideas
EVERYONE from tiny tots to teenagers should find something to amaze or
amuse them this week in the Action Factory's fun-filled, five-day
programme for the school holidays. Magic, mystery and swim discos, for
heaven's sake, are all a far cry from tattie howkin'.
This is the sixth October beanfeast produced by an amalgam of
performers and administrators in the arts around Glasgow -- and the most
ambitious programme yet. From Castlemilk to Milton of Campsie,
activities, workshops and performances take place in community halls,
libraries, museums and theatres.
The Flying Chestycoffs take to the air in Castlemilk, Partick,
Paisley, Govan, Kirkintilloch, Torrance, and Moodiesburn. Workshops by
the hour, day and week, take place in the Crawfurd Theatre at Jordanhill
and the East End Arts Centre in Springboig, the Scottish Mask and Puppet
Centre, Scotland Street School Museum, Kelvingrove Art Gallery, and
Haggs Castle Museum as well as in halls around Strathkelvin. Subjects
range from rave dance to shadow puppetry to a week-long physical theatre
course for 10 to 16 year olds run by the Scottish Ballet Education Unit.
Amateur sleuths between nine and 16 can pit their wits against those
of the great Sherlock Holmes himself in trying to solve who murdered the
lovely assistant of the magician, the Great Zoltan, and what is the
Curse of the Velvet Cloak. The Scottish Youth Theatre presents this
murder, mayhem and mystery in the music hall at the Old Athenaeum,
Buchanan Street.
Younger adventurers aged five to 10 could turn their hand to slaying
dragons and rescuing princesses in a 15-minute adventure every day at
Partick Burgh Halls. Renamed Costa del Dumbarton Road for a week of
guaranteed sunshine, there is a daily programme of theatre and activity,
from Magic Bob's Desert Island Tricks to Hopscotch Theatre Company's The
Real Macbeth to T-shirt making, cheerleading and Zulu warrior dancing.
Glasgow City Council's Parks and Recreation Department is offering
special sports and activities courses in pools and sports centres all
week for holidaying scholars between the ages of five and 18. There are
specialist sports coaching weeks where places have to be booked, but
''Come'n'Try'' activities are available from 10am in trampolining,
boxercise, scuba diving, swim discos and arts and crafts as well as the
traditional football, netball, rugby and racquet sports. Activities cost
just 60p a session.

I FIND it a bit cheeky for an airline which borrowed the British from
British Airways before shaking that airline out of its complacency on
the Scottish London Heathrow run to object to the term Glasgow Prestwick
to define that airport.
Perhaps it will agree to change its name to Midland Airways.
The logic behind calling Glasgow Abbotsinch airport merely Glasgow
Airport was always dubious, and owes more to a desire by the management,
for a long time successful, to run down Prestwick.
Fortunately Prestwick has been hived off from BAA now and is making a
bit of a comeback -- a lesson perhaps for the London airports.
Or perhaps Heathrow should not be allowed to call itself London as it
is as far away from the centre as is Prestwick from Glasgow.

AS A regular but rather confused churchgoer I sympathise with Mr John
Clunas, a self-confessed secular humanist, regarding his comments on the
selection of speakers for Thought for the Day (October 5).
I have reacted similarly when viewing the televised funerals of the
victims of child and mass murderers. The officiating clergyman is the
spokesman for the community and we wait expectantly for some words which
will throw a shaft of light on the horror of the moment.
We wait in vain. He will condemn the act, of course, but is this the
best we can expect from a man of the cloth? Will the grieving family not
look for more?
To take the matter further, I do not know whether to be gladdened or
saddened by the mushrooming of ad hoc organisations dealing with
specific human crises -- Victim Support schemes, Rape Crisis, and
counselling for the bereaved, drug addicts, victims of Aids, and other
disasters.
With professional expertise being channelled into areas of deeper and
ever deeper human tragedy, where does this leave the Church? It seems
content to be seen as a marginalised institution with nothing more to
say at times of crisis than the sympathetic humanist.
National and international atrocities abound and the politicians vie
with each other in their choice of vocabulary as they express their
horror at the latest outrage. Some of them may be Christians but nothing
of this is conveyed in what they say.
One is left wondering what area of life, death, suffering, deprivation
or depravity belongs specifically to the Church. In our hour of
extremity do we look to the Church for an answer or do we have more
confidence in the services of the professional counsellor who has been
specially trained to deal with our particular problem?
Doubtless many of the volunteers in such organisations will be
Christians, but since the organisations are not in themselves run by the
Church the inference must be drawn that support and comfort are
considered possible without reference to the Almighty.
I applaud the efforts of all who are courageous enough to enter
intimately into the sufferings of others, but it seems to me that the
emergence pf specialisms without reference to the spiritual backdrop to
our lives implies the feasibility of neat and precise solutions where
none may exist.
The Church appears to have been squeezed out of those areas of our
lives which matter desperately to us and has been relegated to the
periphery.
The Church initiated education, social welfare, and the like, but only
the historians know this. Today's community reacts only to what it sees.
If the Church does not pull its socks up, the secular humanists are
going to win.

What possible justification can there be for patients in their
eighties to be awakened, washed, dressed, given breakfast, all before
6.30am?
What, in heaven's name, do they do all day? Just sit -- or may be sit
and think? What thoughts they must have.

MOST of us are painfully aware of young qualified people who have
great difficulty in finding jobs. This training has been accomplished
often with great effort on the part of the trainee and at considerable
cost to the country.
For what? No job. Yet our politicians all expound training as being
the solution to people getting jobs, which are not there, and it does
not solve the unemployment.
Useful skills are acquired on the job in industry and industry will
employ them if they are good at the job.
Firms pay corporation tax to encourage firms to train people for jobs
in their companies. Allowances against corporation tax should be
introduced if training is given. Windfall taxes and calls on the
Exchequer would therefore not be required.
Governments should spend more effort on wealth creation and promoting
commercial initiative to compete in world trade.
A small example is honey production. I believe we import some 17,000
tonnes of honey per annum, and yet we could produce better honey in our
own country if we had the enterprising people to go into the business.
We could even become an exporting country.
Bees work or they don't survive.

I wish, I wish The Herald would-

A recent trait I totally deplore
The sentence loses sense
It offends the vision
The present word-division is
A linguistic offence!

Writer and
broadcaster
Sally
Magnusson
has returned
to Scotland
to raise her
family, and will
be contributing
a series of
articles on the
trials and
triumphs of
domestic life.
Here, she
describes the
realisation of
a dream
LAST night we slept. All night. In the same bed from beginning to end.
Ten-and-a-half hours of deep, deep uninvaded slumber. It was delicious.
No wailing baby; no howling dog; no insomniac four-year-old bursting
in at 5.30am with the glad news that ''I've had a wonderful dream,
Mum''; none of the communal singing around dawn in which child Number
Four is wont to lead the assembled bed in a rousing rendition of Old
MacDonald Had a Farm, a point at which I usually slink off to feed
Number Five and my husband, rightly suspicious that I intend to find an
empty bunk and steal some of the sleep that he's patently not going to
get, demands to know where I think I'm off to.
Ah no. Last night we slept. We left the combined forces of mother,
aunt, au pair and a brace of sisters to hold the fort in shifts and we
escaped for 24 hours of solitude.
Goodness knows, we were ready for it. After what I calculate to be
some 3600 nights of floor-pacing and cradle-shuggling, dummy-replacing
and bed-hopping, marital camaraderie in the wee hours has been showing
signs of strain.
These days it stretches about as far as the night's third wake. That's
the point at which we both pretend to be asleep and not to have heard
the baby, who, as we both know, will wake at least two of the others if
not silenced immediately.
Actually, to my intense chagrin, I've discovered lately that my
husband is no longer pretending. These are real snores, dammit. I'm now
faced with the dilemma of either waking him and feeling guilty because,
as he's the first to point out, I'm awake anyway, or of letting him
slumber on and doing the needful myself, again. The trouble is, in this
sleep-hungry state one's finer instincts are a mite repressed. The
soaring resentment of my being awake while he luxuriates noisily in the
one commodity on earth I would kill for right now is --I'm ashamed to
say -- overpowering.
So much so that the other night, sitting up in bed in the darkness
beside this snoring heap, hunched miserably over a colicky baby whose
back it was his turn to thump, I thought I would just give him a little
tap with my foot to alert him to the fact that I had generously taken on
his watch.
Since Number Three had at some point in the night inserted herself
between us, I had to stretch my leg a bit to reach across her with my
little tap. And, OK, I admit it. I did rather misjudge the distance and
the force required to bridge it.
A thunderous roar erupted from the other side of the bed. ''Did you
kick me?'' The bed-clothes rose like a wrathful Neptune from the deep.
''I don't believe it. DID YOU JUST KICK ME?''
I then had to listen, suitably shamed, to a lecture about what things
had come to when a chap couldn't feel safe in his own bed. The dignity
of this tirade was weakened somewhat by the revelation that the dream
from which he had been so untimely ripped had ended abruptly with the
comedian Jim Broadbent shooting him in the leg with a double-barrelled
telescope.
Collapse of combatants in giggles. In all the excitement the baby fell
asleep. And in the morning we decided we needed a break.
So here we are. As I write, I'm still in bed, propped up against the
soft, fat pillows in which I sank to oblivion last night. The remains of
the largest breakfast I've ever eaten are on my lap, a cup of exquisite
coffee steams within perfect reach of my right hand, a fire is
flickering in the grate and through the open window ahead of me a forest
of red and yellow leaves is stirring faintly.
In a moment I might saunter through to the en-suite and immerse myself
for a long time in a foaming white bath, without stubbing my toe on a
toy soldier or running out of water because everyone's been in before
me. Ah, the bliss.
When you're savouring every minute, a 24-hour break can feel like a
fortnight's holiday.
There has only been one minor hitch. The reason we are awake at all
right now and not clinging to sleep until we're turfed out, still
clutching our pillows and sobbing, ''You can't do this to us'', is a
little matter of milk. My milk. While the baby has been downing SMA by
the pint-load, his usual sources of nourishment don't know what's hit
them, or rather, what hasn't hit them.
I woke up with two gigantic rocks clamped to my chest. My husband, who
couldn't believe his luck, started to quote rapturously something about
my twin fawns browsing among the lilies, and prepared for action.
Unfortunately the only action my wondrous figure could stand was
urgent deflation. And this could be found -- and thank goodness we
weren't -- by methodically squirting milk into the hotel's best
snowy-white bath-towel. Gallons of the stuff. No wonder that child's so
fat.
After a solid half-an-hour of this, surely the least erotic thing you
can possibly do with a pair of breasts, my beloved had ceased raving
about fawns and I was back with a couple of deer enjoying the grass.
Let's just hope the chambermaids don't go around tasting the towels.

VISITORS could be forgiven if they thought they had found themselves
on the set of a hi-tech James Bond movie instead of touring a massive,
mountain-clad engineering project.
For behind the often mist-covered slopes of Ben Cruachan, as it rises
from the shores of Loch Awe, deep in the heart of the mountain, lies the
workings of one of Europe's biggest hydro-electric power stations.
Built at a cost of #12m, the well-hidden Ben Cruachan, opened by The
Queen in 1965, the power station, which produces 450 million units of
electricity every year, is now 30 years old.
Scotland's hollow mountain is invisible to the eye of motorists
passing along the roadside of Loch Awe heading to or from Oban.
Built by the then North of Scotland Hydro Electric Board it is now
controlled by ScottishPower who took over the station in 1990.
On Saturday, local MP Ray Michie, Liberal-Democrat member for Argyll
and Bute, planted a tree to commemorate the 30th anniversary.
The station is open to visitors from Easter until the end of October.

SCOTTISH boxer Gary Jacobs yesterday admitted he is under pressure
from his family to quit the fight game.
Jacobs was speaking after being at ringside in Glasgow on Friday night
when bantamweight James Murray was fatally injured.
Now the 29-year-old welterweight, who lost his world title fight with
America's Pernell Whittaker this summer, says he ''doesn't know'' what
boxing can do to prevent tragedies.
''I've not really thought about it, but there is a lot of pressure on
me from my family and friends,'' Jacobs told Scottish Television viewers
after having been asked if he was considering quitting.
Jacobs, a highly-respected figure in Scottish sport, and wife Linda
have two young daughters.
''It's another tragedy and it is the first time I've been there. I've
been in boxing a long time and I've read about it, seen deaths on
television but this is the closest I've been to it.
''I was there and I spoke to James Murray an hour before the fight and
wished him all the best.''
Jacobs has won Scottish, British, Commonwealth, European and WBC
titles during an eight-year pro career.
''Boxing will go on but I don't know what it can do. There are few
tragedies in boxing but when it happens it is on television.''
Jacobs slammed those responsible for the riots which raged around the
ring even as Murray lay injured.
''That was horrendous,'' he said. ''I think they were half drunk when
they came in and they were going to start trouble win, lose or draw.''

NOTHING is more confirming of a man's age than a clinging to the past
as being all that was glorious. I suppose that an exception may be made
in allusions to fishing as long as they are brief in the telling.
A few years ago (there I go) I lived in a rented farmhouse on a
500-acre sheep farm in the isolated Yarrow Valley. The farmhouse stood
at the end of the Loch of the Lowes. True to its name at sunset the
whole water became a wreath of flaming light, a remarkable sight when
viewed from the large farmhouse kitchen which looked across the loch. A
year was enough of this lonely ethereal beauty but in the meantime I had
the use of a small rowing boat and the right to fish whenever the notion
took me.
I would make eagerly for the boat at dusk just as the lights of that
famous inn, Tibbie Shiels, were peeping down the loch. It was here that
Walter Scott used to meet the Ettrick Shepherd to discuss literature and
enjoy a glass of wine. My rod was always at the ready together with my
fish basket, but in all that year I never saw a fish out of this loch.
It was over-populated with pike which I had been assured were regularly
removed. There were other compensations -- the bird life, often rare and
the still peace of those rolling hills.
My first rod, a two-piece split cane was first used on the small river
Lyne beyond Romano Bridge and caught my first wild brownies. My first
catch should have been returned to the river but I was keen to convince
my Edinburgh landlady that I could fish. I often caught fish but failed
to catch the last bus in my eagerness. It was a long walk to Edinburgh.
Years later in the seclusion of the Yarrow Valley, all hope lost of
catching fish on the Loch of the Lowes, I came across what appeared to
be flighting pools with no obvious link to the river, and to my surprise
saw large rings appear on the surface. Hurrying back for my C.C. de
France I threw a fly across the pools without attracting a rise, but my
son, trying his skill, had a plump brown trout for breakfast.
We caught several fine trout from those pools but to this day wonder
how those fish got there and why our small preserve had not been poached
before. And as for Meggat Water, Andrew Lang tells of staying at Tibbie
Shiel's famous inn and sleeping in her box-beds, where so often the
Ettrick Shepherd and Christopher North had lain, after copious toddy,
''not in our time will any man, like the Ettrick Shepherd, need a cart
to carry the trout he had slain on Meggat Water.''
I have my doubts, but then I remain a purist.

Rennie McOwan finds out where the original 39 Steps can be found and
wonders why no-one has made a good film of the book
SOME towns take on the character of people. I have heard it said that
Peebles is the dowager-aunt of the Borders, elderly, respectable, grey
and along with her cronies, keeping an eye on the doings of her friends.
It is true that as one drives into this historic burgh one can almost
hear the tea cups clinking and the tongues wagging. Author Nigel Tranter
described it as the good looking matron of Borderland.
But before Peebles folk get hot under the collar at such allegations,
it must be said that there is another Peebles, one which thrives with
life and knows how to enjoy itself.
The old Scottish feast of Beltane, the Celtic New Year, was normally
celebrated in the Highlands at the start of the spring, but Peebles folk
switched it to later in the year and enjoy its festivities still.
A critical and possibly scurrilous poem about the loose morals of some
of the clergy in past centuries, The Tales of the Thrie Priestis of
Peebles, has some lines about a lively social life which every informed
inhabitant of the town knows:
Was never in Scotland hard nor sene,
Sic dancing nor deray:
Nother at Falklandon the Grene
Nor Pebilles at the Play
King James I is normally given as the author, although some historians
say it is more likely it was James V whose ideas about enjoying oneself
would have given the editor of The Sun -- if it had existed then --
columns of material which would have made the activities of some of
today's royals look very small beer indeed.
But Peebles is beautiful. It is a clean-looking town. It lies beside
the splendid, 97-miles-long River Tweed, surrounded by wooded hills. It
has ancient roots and resisted or was swamped by many an English
invasion. The old town has known flaming roofs and the swish of arrows.
The High Street is one of the most attractive in the Borders, with
good shops and wasn't-that-nice hotels. The huge Peebles Hydro combines
old and new with success.
Perhaps above all, both the town and the surrounding area are of great
literary importance. Author John Buchan's under-rated sister Anna, who
wrote under the name of O Douglas, lived in Peebles in Bank House, with
her brother Walter. John was a regular visitor there.
John Buchan, the first Lord Tweedsmuir, tends to be best remembered
nowadays for his adventure novels, The Thirty Nine Steps, Greenmantle,
John Macnab, Witch Wood and many others, rather than for his biographies
of Sir Walter Scott or James Graham, Marquis of Montrose, or Cromwell,
all of which have become outdated to some extent because of modern
historical research.
An absorbing book by Paul Webb, A Buchan Companion, which came out
last year, annoyed some Buchan fans because it ranges over all the
novels and their characters with an informed and sardonic eye. Like the
novels themselves, the Webb book is a rattling good read.
When wandering the streets of Peebles, or exploring historic corners,
or the lovely, green Borders hills nearby, or strolling by the Tweed to
that child-of-war, historic Neidpath Castle, which looks as a castle
should, it is difficult to shake off the memories of John Buchan and his
sister, and who would want to?
He once wrote to Anna:
We were two children, you and I,
Unkempt, unwatched, far-wandering shy,
Trudging from morn with easy load.
While Faery law adown the road . . .
Anna Buchan wrote a romantic novel called Penny Plain which is still
available, a kind of upmarket Mills and Boon, the story of a poverty
stricken Borders girl, Jean Jardine, struggling to bring up her family,
who just escapes being a prig, forms a friendship with a rich aristo,
Pamela Reston, and yes, you've guessed it, meets and marries Pamela's
brother Biddy (Lord Bidborough).
Her fictional town is called Priorsford and it is Peebles to the life.
The book should not be hurled away as romantic slush because it is well
written and laced with little vignettes of historical or literary
information. Anna Buchan was very clever.
You can find out more about all this at the John Buchan Centre at the
nearby village of Broughton where John spent family holidays, learn
where the real 39 steps were sited, and enjoy an argument as to why
no-one has made a decent film of that book, and why filmmakers think
they should change the plot. There's a Greenmantle Hotel there and
Greenmantle real ale.
Many historic figures march in Peebles historic pageant. Professor
John Veitch, the local lad who became a distinguished academic and who
wrote lovely descriptions of the Borders hills and glens; James
Williamson, provost of ''Piblis'', who gave the town a silver arrow in
1628 to encourage archery; James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd, Robert
Louis Stevenson (who lived here in his youth), and the Chambers brothers
who founded the famous publishing house and who gave Peebles the
Chambers Institute. Millionaire Andrew Carnegie topped up its facilities
with a grant.
The Cross Keys Hotel is believed to be the original Cleikum Inn of Sir
Walter Scott's novel, St Ronan's Well. The Tontine Inn also catches the
eye, built by public subscription in 1808: subscribers could be of any
age and the longest liver could have the whole. African explorer Mungo
Park also lived in Peebles and churchmen of old, soldiers, monarchs and
herds all knew this town.
Peebles is a convenient centre for glen wandering or hill walking. The
rounded summit of Broughton Heights is one of the best viewpoints in the
Southern Uplands, ranging from upper Tweedsdale, the northern shores of
the Forth, the Tinto-Culter Fell gap and the hills near Turnberry, which
are 60 miles away.
Here, too, are memories of warrior kings, faeries and wizards: it's a
magic area and a magic town.

THE main enemies of woodland are grazing animals, both farm livestock
and as often as not wild deer. Excessive numbers of animals over a
number of years prevent the young trees from growing in the openings
that naturally occur or leads to the absence of a woodland understorey.
In fact, this is the Scottish version of agroforestry and the
sheltered grazing in many of our hill birch and oak woods and the cover
for both red and roe deer is valued by farmers and landowers.
The damage to the woodland is not always as obvious as gnawing of the
bark or trampling of roots but might only be visible to a forester as an
imbalance in the age structure or species mix.
In time, the overgrazing leads to the woodland becoming impoverished
or even dying out.
The ideal solution would be to reduce grazing pressure but an overall
reduction in livestock or deer numbers will often affect the economic
viability of the farm or estate.
The solution in small to medium sized woodlands unfortunately lies in
exclusion of practically all grazing animals, although in time, once the
woodland has recovered they can be allowed back in.
Fortunately, financial assistance is available in terms of grant aid
under the Forestry Authority's Woodland Grant Scheme (WGS).
To give grazed woodlands a chance to recover, the erection of fences
around open areas is 50% grant aided with a fixed payment of #525 per
hectare once the young regeneration becomes established.
While there is some initial outlay in fencing costs, annual income
payments of either #80 per hectare on wooded area or #60 per hectare on
open areas (under the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme) means that in many
cases the initial outlay is quickly recovered.
The seedling and establishment of young trees may take a number of
years and success will vary between one woodland and another and even
within a single woodland, depending as it does on various biological
factors such as climate and vegetation type.
The fixed (capital) payment is therefore likely to be paid in stages
as areas of new young regeneration appear above the level of the
surrounding vegetation. There is a certain satisfaction in seeing the
recovery of an overgrazed woodland in addition to the financial pay-off.

Sue Innes attends an Edinburgh seminar on attitudes to birth and
child-rearing, and finds that age-old problems have yet to be solved
ONE woman talked about how hard it had been going back to work four
weeks after her baby was born. But, dismissed from the Army and on her
own she had no other income or choice. Another said how great it was to
be back at work, though childcare cost more than half her wages. A young
single mother said she had come under pressure either to have an
abortion or marry her boyfriend: ''In the nineties at least I had
another choice. And it's turned out fine.''
Few other subjects can bring together grandmothers and schoolgirls and
women of all ages in between, with so much to say. Yet the seminar held
last week by Edinburgh District Council's women's committee in
association with the exhibition From Here to Maternity (in the city's
Huntly House Museum) was an unusual public recognition of this dimension
of our private lives. As is the exhibition itself. Hung with (nice
clean) nappies and baby clothes and bringing together a paraphenalia of
birth and babyhood over a century, it elicits a surprised realisation of
how rarely museums or galleries feature such material.
It may be seen, in museum terms, as risky and emotive stuff, but
public response has been enthusiastic. The exhibition was first mounted
by the People's Palace two years ago (though this is an augmented
version) and Glasgow Museums say it has been one of their most
successful exhibitions ever, on tour since it opened and for the
foreseeable future. ''I think that's because you get the genuine feel of
people behind it,'' says the curator who created it, Liz Carnegie. ''And
because it does deal honestly with childbirth. It's not rose-coloured
spectacles, and it does recognise conflicting feelings and opinions.''
The comments in the visitors' book in Edinburgh back her point. Most
commonly, visitors have said it brought back memories, mixed as well as
good, and made them think about possibilities -- or not.
If the exhibition shows how much expectations, prams, bottles and
(thank goodness) birthing methods have changed during the past 100
years, discussion of women's choices in having and bringing up children
showed how the dilemmas we face have not changed as much. Women talked
about the pressures to have children -- and not to have them too young
or too old -- and financial pressures when you do. Single mothers talked
about the pressure not to have a child outside marriage, still felt as
scandalous: ''My mother cared more about what the neighbours would think
than anything else,'' one woman said.
That it is more acceptable now not to have children was a particular
focus of discussion. Older women said they had never questioned whether
they wanted children, but now you could, and indeed should. Researcher
Cathy Howieson said she was sure she didn't want children, but that
often met with a disapproving or patronising response. ''Virtual
strangers seem to feel they have a right to comment. I'm seen as
selfish, unwomanly . . . as a hard-hearted, ambitious career woman.''
The assumption that if you didn't have children then it must be to put
work first was particularly irksome -- there were, as she said, more
than two options in life.
Yet to focus on choice is to be conscious of the limitations on
choice: constrained possibilities because of the absence of good,
affordable childcare, the lower wages most women with children have, the
limited possibilities for adequately paid part-time work, and the very
few firms and organisations which offer any ''family friendly'''
provision. The council's own workplace nursery has been a great success,
and one employee there said how much easier it had made her own life,
but with 29 places for a workforce of 3500 there is a long waiting list.
Hama Cummings, a health visitor and mother of grown-up children,
remembered how she worked night shift when her children were young,
sleeping in the mornings when they were at school, waking up to collect
them at 3pm, ''trying to be bright and alert''. In retrospect she
wonders whether the busy round, all her energy going into coping, left
enough time to enjoy having children: ''It goes past so quickly -- and
you cannot put the clock back.''
But the alternative is too often isolation, often compounded by
poverty. Women and children increasingly live in suburban and estate
ghettoes, apart from the adult world. More than a third of women with
young babies in one survey were alone with the baby for between eight
and 12 hours on weekdays and felt completely cut off. Post-natal
depression is widespread. The kind of networks that mothers of young
children create to socialise and for support are less easy to sustain
when there are fewer mothers and children at home.
A final theme was the need for young women to be clued up, to plan
their lives and think seriously both about careers and where family life
might fit into that. Careers guidance, as one schoolgirl pointed out, is
about choice at work but there was no guidance about how work and home
life can fit together. But talk of making career plans and choices could
be unrealistic, said another young woman: ''If you'd asked me when I was
16, I would have said I was going to have a great career and be rich and
have a male secretary.'' At 22, her life had turned out very
differently, ''but then, life does, doesn't it?''

THE run up the west coast was great. We were able to admire all the
crops of wheat and spring barley that were still dripping dry on the way
up to Inverness.
We were also able to observe how little black ground there is. The
ripples caused by the monsoon will be felt for a long time. But what
really interested me was the Highlands of Wester Ross.
As a Lowlander whose forefathers pushed the Highlanders upwards and
westwards out of Aberdeenshire in the first half of this millennium, I
have been brought up to despise the Highlands as barren and useless.
And yet I was impressed with what we saw of Wester Ross. The whole
place seemed tidier. We didn't see a single dead sheep and the crofts
were well fenced and shining with whitewash rather than over-run with
hens, rusting tooth-movers and binders.
There's a lot of new building, too. None of it is attractive, exactly
-- it is nearly all boring kit houses -- and yet it is nice to see some
action. And there seems to have been a new attempt to surround the
houses with trees and even gardens.
Can it be that all the public money that has been poured into the
Highlands is bearing fruit at last?
My idea of a West Highland shop is modelled on the one at Iona 30
years ago. Apparently the proprietor was asked for 20 Batchelor's. ''No,
no,'' said the shopkeeper, ''I don't keep them at all. They're not a
good keeping cigarette. No sooner have you stocked them than you're sold
out and you've to order more.
''Capstan full strength now, there's a good keeping cigarette. A
carton of them lasts for ages.''
Now, however, the shops all seemed well stocked, well run and
relatively busy. Many are run by white settlers.
The pattern with many of the small rural shops in the North-east
Lowlands has been of a hopeless struggle against the big superstores,
mitigated near the end by a sale to a bright-eyed idealist from the
South.
After a year or so the idealist has found out. He may find another
soft touch from the South, but then the shoppie closes.
For whatever reason, however, the settler shopkeepers of Wester Ross
seem to be thriving.
As a farmer, I was particularly impressed with the fish farms. Now,
instead of letting the salmon roam half way round the world using tonnes
of energy, being eaten by predators or cannibalised, and then having
them batter their ways up through spates and waterfalls to lay their
eggs, they are produced in their thousands in nice, safe little
factories which give the locals steady work.
Of course, it may not be all gain. One version of the truth is that
the wild salmon hang about the cages, pinching food and getting sea lice
infestations.
The Breadwinner and I get the best of beef when we are at home. We
hang it for a month, which gives it a flavour unattainable in hotels. So
we ate nothing but seafood on our holiday.
We had good Achiltibuie kippers or very good Aultbea smokies for
breakfast. For lunch we had average prawns Marie Rose or a fine seafood
mixed platter of mussels (the biggest I've seen) smoked salmon, soused
herring and more prawns, and some manky fried haddock. For dinner there
were more seafood starters and lobster or Dublin Bay prawns.
Boy, were we glad to get home for a steak!
And all was well at home. Potions had handled the cattle admirably. We
had only weaned them the day before we left, and yet after three days
away the roaring had stopped as the cows and the calves made a start on
the work of chewing their way through a thousand five-foot bales of
straw.
The cows have to go out again, but I'm afraid the only bit of decent
feeding is some aftermath with a very tasty infestation with couch grass
on what is to be our setaside.
And that has shown up the shame of what the new cereal-based system of
farming is doing to the once great cattle country of Aberdeenshire.
My ancestors used a six-year rotation. After three years in crop the
land got a three-year rest in grass. That way all the fences had to be
kept up.
Now the inferior stuff is in the grass and the rest is in crop for 11
months in the year. Though the fences are kept up on the pastures, on
the cropping land they are no more than historical landmarks.
So when we want to put some beasts on the setaside we have few days'
fencing to do. The field in question is 23 acres and odd shaped, so it
is the guts of a mile round, and I hate fencing. The other hammer is
always beside the strainer, somewhere.

German conference is fertile ground for sales.
EVERY two years, for six days, the top players in the food and drink
industry worldwide gather in Cologne for Anuga, the largest and probably
one of the most important trade events. It has proved to be fertile
ground for Scottish companies over a number of years and, this year,
there was no mistaking the determination of Scottish exhibitors to win
an increasing share of the global market.
When Mr Ken McGregor started keeping bees as a hobby 45 years ago, he
had no inkling that he had set himself, and eventually his family, on
the road to a new career. Today, the three original hives have become
1000 and Denrosa honeys, produced in Coupar Angus from bees which can
count Royal Deeside among their summer homes, are increasingly found in
the country's specialist delicatessens.
Mr McGregor's son, Murray, is spearheading the developments of the
business into Europe and beyond and is also developing new products --
mustards, oils, and vinegars.
While it is expensive for a small family business to exhibit abroad,
the McGregors believe it is vital to find new markets for what are
luxury, top of the range products.
''We won't know for quite a while how cost effective the trip has been
but we must adapt to an increasingly diversified and dynamic
marketplace,'' said Murray.
The same philosophy also applies at the other end of the scale with
Scotland's largest red meat company, Scottish Premier, part of the
Inverurie-based ANM Group, looking to expand already sizeable exports of
Scottish beef and lamb. It supplies traditional High Street butchers and
supermarkets throughout the UK but sees development of the Continental
market as vital.
''Anuga attracts meat buyers from throughout Europe as well as other
important meat importing countries in the Far East and we must exhibit
if we want to further develop our export trade on behalf of Scottish
farmers,'' said executive director Mr Raymond Wight.
For Mr Martin Grantley-Smith, chief executive of Scotmex, the export
marketing arm of the Scottish meat industry, the Scottish turnout in the
meat sector was particularly pleasing, given recent disruption in some
parts of the German market.
Finding completely new products is one of the highlights of walking
through the miles of exhibition halls -- 260,000 square metres at the
last count -- and one first was a biodegradeable plastic soup can from
the Shetland Smokehouse of Skeld.
Seafood soups are notoriously difficult to produce properly but a new
process developed at Skeld is producing a freshly-made soup with a
30-day shelf life and with the contents in full view.
There is often help available for those wanting to exhibit abroad --
and Scottish Enterprise were playing a major role at Anuga -- but
setting out a stall in a worldwide marketplace is not for the
faint-hearted.
One group of businessmen from Dumfries and Galloway were able to
benefit from a ''dry run'' this year, however.Dumfries and Galloway
local enterprise company raised the profile of their food companies
considerably when they were first in Scotland to host the regional
centrepiece in the Food from Scotland Exhibition at this year's Royal
Highland Show and Ms Dorothy Hannagh, DGE development executive,
believes it is vital that companies not only assess the competition but
also look at product development, pricing policies, and packaging as
well as market opportunities.
''This was our first outward mission of this kind and the feedback has
been excellent,'' she said. ''The area has a number of forward-looking,
progressive companies who have the products but for whom an event like
Anuga is a huge unknown. Many also have fewer than 10 employees so the
costs also have to be borne in mind. By putting together a subsidised
trip, we hope we can encourage them to expand their horizons and to look
beyond the UK.''

In a new series, Anne Johnstone examines the problems confronting
authorities in regenerating neglected assets.
BARCELONA has a great big one. Manchester's got one. Birmingham's got
one and from this week Glasgow will have one too. The Dear Green Place
is now officially a city of vision.
When 110 of Glasgow's opinion formers were gathered in the City
Chambers in November last year, their task sounded deceptively simple.
It was:
Come up with a ''vision statement'' for the future of the city.
It was to identify strengths to build on and weaknesses to tackle. The
statement was to describe a set of shared aspirations for Glasgow for
the coming 15 to 20 years; a sort of municipal Clause 4. But as the
Labour Party discovered, asking a very disparate group of men and women
to agree on a star to steer by is easier said than done.
A steering group of the Great and Good was set up; two profs, a peer,
a barrister, an MEP and at least half a dozen directors and chief
executives of this and that. It took them four months to come up with a
two sentence statement. It began:''As Glasgow moves into the 21st
Century, it will flourish as an international city where people will
choose to live, learn, work and play.'' It was a start.
Four working parties were then set up to tackle these four headings
and the statement has now been expanded into a document which goes out
for consultation this week. It was always going to be a thankless task.
Produce a set of specific aspirations and projects, and the exercise
would be dismissed as a fait accompli in which public consultation was a
sham. Keep it general and they risk condemnation for woolly, wordy,
worthiness. They opted for the latter.
There are some bizarre oversights: no mention of Glasgow's shameful
litter problem; nothing about the requirements of a public transport
system for the 21st Century; nothing about the contributions of the
city's ethnic minorities. Hopefully such gaps will be filled by members
of the public, whose comments are now invited. Copies of the document
will be available in all the city's libraries.
WELCOME to your new office, declares the billboard advert which sprung
up across Glasgow last week. Special marketing for the city's enormous
superfluity of commercial property? Eye-catching publicity for a new
hi-tech office development? No. This is Panasonic plugging its latest
mobile phone.
In case you don't get the message, behind the slogan there's one of
those bleary satellite images of planet earth. It seems to say, get a
mobile, a fax machine and a few more bits of trendy kit and you have a
''virtual office.'' The virtual office has no walls. It's where you are.
On the motorway, up a mountain, in bed. The ad raises today's key
question about cities. Who needs 'em?
The logic of such thinking, combined with an intensely anti-city
policy in Britain since the last war, could reduce our once great cities
to what Peter Russell recently described to me as ''a series of spent
volcanoes.'' Russell is the council official charged with Glasgow's City
Vision project, which began with a daringly radical question. Why
Glasgow?
Michael Parkinson, director of the European Institute for Urban
Affairs at Liverpool John Moores University, believes the confidence
crisis implied by the question is misplaced. ''The spotlight may have
moved elsewhere, but Glasgow has achieved an enormous amount and it set
the agenda for provincial British cities.''
And in general, he says the impact of information technology on cities
has been much exaggerated:''Though lots of work could be done from home,
research shows people don't like living and working in the same box. In
the world of work insecurity and paranoeia, people need the comfort of
their colleagues around them. Besides, all the key decision-making
functions can't be relocated because people want and need to have face
to face contact.''
What can be recloacted and has been to an enormous degree is
manufacturing. Some of the anti-slamming devices on doors in the City
Chambers are marked with the maker's address: Cochrane St, Glasgow, 30
feet away. Replacements probably come from Taiwan. Glasgow's success to
date has been about a radical restructuring from manufacturing to
service industries. Today only 15% of jobs come from manufacturing. Old
Glasgow was product-based. New Glasgow is people-based.
At the same time, the internal market in Europe and rapid transport
links are changing the European map. It may not be happening as fast as
some predicted but national boundaries are becoming less significant and
urban areas are becoming the building blocks of the new Europe.
Strathclyde Region's dying act next year will be to host a major
international conference on the future of metropolitan regions.
Much of this future will be characterised by competition between
Europe's urban areas. Sadly, Britain's cities are not well armed for
this fight. ''In Europe governments have recognised that cities are
assets, not liabilities. Devolution of responsibility has given local
decision makers space to play in. In Britain we've been going in the
opposite direction. We've been willing cities to become more dynamic but
denying them the means,'' says Parkinson.
This policy is not new to Britain. Peter Russell maintains that since
the 1940s British policy has been dominated by ''the idea of the city as
something to be avoided even to be dismantlewd and repackaged as garden
suburbs and new towns.''
To add insult to injury the way that regional policy has operated,
particularly in Scotland, has effectively sucked mnaufacturing jobs out
of Glasgow and deterred inward investors. Earlier this year the Herald
revealed how Scottish Office policies, particularly the financial
packages available to New Towns and Enterprise Zones, are stripping
Glasgow of its residual manufacturing base.
Feelings about the operation of Locate in Scotland, SEN's inward
investment arm, are running so high in the City Chambers that the agency
is commonly dubbed ''Locate Anywhere Else in Scotland''. Steve Inch, the
city's head of economic development, can name only one manufacturing
company to locate in Glasgow in the last decade, Patrol Jeans in
Easterhouse.
With no Scottish Office cities strategy worth the name, beyond the
Partnership programme, which has rejuvenated part of Castlemilk, Glasgow
is fixing its hopes on European money. The city is thought to be first
in line in Scotland for a #7m grant from a new EU initiative called
Urban.
But there's precious little else to celebrate in the City Chambers and
fears that local government reorganisation could put Glasgow at an even
bigger disadvantage. Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of Glasgow
Development Agency, says Glasgow's situation in Scotland is unique
because of the tightness of the city boundary:''We've allowed the city
to be Balkanised. Unless there's some central direction for the whole
conurbation, Glasgow will become like a doughnut with all the
development round the edge.''
So is Glasgow's recovery grinding to a halt? Rather than being
promoted to the second division of European cities, the stated aim in
1990, will the current so-called ''competitive benachmarking'' exercise,
being carried out at Glasgow University, reveal that Glasgow is sliding
in the wrong direction?
First the good news. The most basic litmus test of a city's well-being
is population. Until recently Glasgow continued to lose population from
right across the metropolitan area. Today the city's population is
stable at about 700,000. What draws people back? It's a complex question
involving many aspects of the quality of life, including transport,
shopping, education, leisure activities and cultural pursuits, as well
as feeling safe from crime and environmental hazards. But employment
outweighs everything.
The new Government Employment Census, due out later this month, will
show Glasgow bucking the UK trend, with big falls in unemployment since
1992. During that period the number of jobless in the city has fallen by
21%, more than any other British city. Over the same period Birmingham's
unemployment has fallen by 9.3% and Manchester's by 8%. Even allowing
for a very high initial figure (45,000 or enough to fill the new Ibrox),
Glasgow is doing well. The curious combination of an excellent
telecommunications network and an international prediliction for the
Scottish accent, has given the city trememdous drawing power in
attracting telephone sales operations.
Are we putting too many eggs in the same service basket? Michael
Parkinson observes:''The most successful cities in Europe are in Germany
where they have worked hard to retain manufacturing in cities.'' Today
cities like Nuremberg, Glasgow's twin, are reaping the benefits of heavy
investment in both training and apprenticeships and research and
development, to enable them to first devise, then produce
future-oriented products.
Today the Herald reveals that there is approximately the same area of
vacant and derelict land in Glasgow now as before the Scottish
Development Agency began its big clean-up operation. Planners and
politicians believe these blots on the landscape are seriously damaging
Glasgow's hard-won new image and deter investors from coming here.
Without the resumption of a rolling programme to tackle the problem
Glasgow will be carrying the ugly bequest of 19th Century
industrialisation right into the 21st Century.
NOTE TO SUBS: THIS NEXT PAR CAN BE OMITTED IF THE GRAPHIC SHOWING THE
DISTORTED MAP OF EUROPE IS NOT BEING USED WITH IT.
Another perceived problem is Glasgow's peripheral position in Europe.
While high speed rail links in Europe are drawing cities in the central
core closer together, countries like Britain and Italy, which have
failed to make such investments are rendered more remote. But others
counter that air links are what matter and the fact that our businessmen
can travel to Brussels, or Paris and back in a day is more important.
Parkinson maintains that peripherality is psychological anyway. You're
only as remote as you think:''Peripheral cities with poor
infrastructures are going to suffer but they have to think about how
they can insert themselves culturally and economically into the heart of
Europe. Hence, all the networking going on. Glasgow has been pretty good
at this.''
Meanwhile the city's most urgent problem is social exclusion, the vast
number of unemployed or under-employed Glaswegians whose income excludes
them from most of what goes to make up our quality of life. In Glasgow
their plight is exaggerated by their isolation and concentration on the
city's peripheral estates. There's a recognition now that the flapship
policies of the '80s benefit winners rather than losers. Stuart
Gulliver, a great supporter of such projects in the past, admits,
there's change in the air:''There's going to be less heroics, less urban
jewellery, fewer grand gestures. We've got to get down to the business
of making the economy more efficient and doing more about these excluded
people.''
Bob Holman, professor of social policy at Glasgow University, who
lives in Easterhouse, says it's no good improving cities only for those
at the top while inequalities grow. ''Our objective should be cities
where all our facilities are enjoyed by all the people. You can't
pretend Glasgow is a success story when a women is three times more
likely to die prematurely in Easterhouse than the rest of the city.''
You catch here a whiff of the sort of determination and idealism that
went into Glasgow's post War Clyde Valley Regional Plan, now largely
credited to the visionary genius of Robert Grieve. Sir Robert, now 84
and dying of cancer, last week read through a copy of the Glasgow City
Vision document and shook his head:''We believed in what we were doing.
We believed we could create a more beautiful, more equitable future.
It's not possible now. It's money that counts now, not idealism.''

AFTER the Second World War, Europe's shattered cities struggled out of
the rubble to enjoy almost 30 years of growth. But during the 1970s that
growth faltered. In many cases populations declined as the most
prosperous citizens migrated to the suburbs or the countryside beyond.
The fabric of our cities started to show serious signs of decay.
Manufacturing declined rapidly and by the same measure social and
economic problems grew: poverty, unemployment, crime, litter, vandalism.
Suddenly the factors which used to shape urban development, such as
rivers and the proximity of raw materials have lost their relevance.
Manufacturing and some services too, can be relocated on the other side
of the country, the Continent, even the world, at the push of a button.
Everywhere an unprecedented squeeze on public spending is eating into
core services. These changes have produced a crisis of confidence in
city halls right across Europe. Some commentators even question the
long-term viability of the city.
In response, Europe's cities are moving in two somewhat contradictory
directions: they are co-operating more and they are competing more. That
means those running a city like Glasgow now spend far more time and
energy than even 10 years ago on comparing their city with others
perceived to be in the same boat.
On the one hand, our officials and planners are spending more time on
the move, visiting other cities, and attending conventions to pool
experiences and learn from mistakes made elsewhere. On the other, this
city is currently engaged in its second so-called ''competitive
benchmarking'' exercise.
The last one, using a range of indicators including population change
and productivity between 1986 and 1991, put Glasgow towards the bottom
of the third division of European cities. The stated aim at the time was
to move the city to the top of division two.
As part of this series on the survival of European cities, Herald
features writer Anne Johnstone travelled to three European cities to
give them a quick fitness test for the 21st century. Like Glasgow, all
have a distinguished past but have had to cope with both the emigration
of the middle class and the rapid contraction of the industrial core.
In today's article we reveal the extent of the problem of Glasgow's
vacant and derelict land and show how we're right back where we started
in the early 1980s.
Later this week we take you to the Bavarian city of Nuremberg, one of
Glasgow's twin cities, to see how it is handling rapid industrial
decline on top of the costs of German reunification and a bold
environmental policy. We will invite you on board the new Eurostar train
from London to Lille, capital of the Nord Pas de Calais region of
northern France. In the 1990 benchmarking exercise Lille appeared
alongside Glasgow in the third division. How is the ancient capital of
Flanders shaping up now.
Finally we're off to the sun. Like Glasgow, Seville, ancient capital
of Andalusia, on the southern tip of Spain, suffers from its peripheral
position in Europe. And as in Glasgow a gigantic flagship event (Expo
1992) left the city with both problems and opportunities.
Everywhere, we found people asking the same sorts of questions:
* Can cities retain a manufacturing role, so crucially important in
employment terms?
* How can cities re-use and revitalise decaying, abandoned areas and
degraded land?
* How can the quality of life in cities be improved? In particular,
how can people be persuaded to leave their cars at home in the suburbs,
or, even better, move back into ''town''?
* How can we change our perception of cities from one based on
''problem people'' and ''problem areas'' to one which recognises
strengths and opportunities?
* How can we cope humanely with the consequences of a situation in
which economic growth no longer equals employment growth?
* Is an underclass of long-term unemployed a permanent and inevitable
feature of modern urban life?
* How can we formulate visions of the future for our cities and make
them happen?
We're not just asking the Great and the Good to tell us what they
think. We're asking YOU to give us your vision of Glasgow for the year
2010 and tell us how we can achieve it. The Herald's great City Vision
Competition is launched tomorrow. And there will be super cash prizes
for the most imaginative entries.

YOU can almost bet that tomorrow Mr Blair will rise in the Commons to
ask the Prime Minister if his Defence Secretary, Michael Portillo,
represents his Government's European policy. It is in Labour's interests
now to open up a new divide in the Tory party.
This is to be expected. Without total unity the Government may not now
survive until its preferred date for the next election in 1997. The
Tories are re-uniting and Mr Blair must put a stop to this if he can. Mr
Major's technical Commons majority is now only five.
The party conference season revealed that all parties are fully aware
that a General Election next year is possible, if the Ulster Unionists,
with their 13 votes, want it. The result of this is that manoeuvres for
the campaign begin now. There will be a lot of point-scoring.
Hence Mr Blair sees an opening on Mr Portillo who distressed Tory
Euro-moderates (within and outwith the Cabinet) with a jingoistic
conference speech such as was not permitted to happen at the other party
conferences. The Prime Minister led the applause for Mr Portillo in
Blackpool, but then it was Mr Redwood and not Mr Portillo who stood
against him in the summer for the leadership.
It was not difficult to deduce that Mr Portillo felt obliged to
reassert himself as a right-wing figurehead, particularly on Europe,
above Mr Redwood. Such is the stuff of conference politics. But now we
are into the stuff of General Elections. All the party leaders geared up
for this.
Let us look at the situation as the present session of Parliament
draws to an end and a new one begins with the Queen's Speech and the
Budget next month. From Mr Blair's point of view the summer has seen Mr
Major's leadership restored and revived so he has to seek ways of
demonstrating that he is still not addressing the problems faced by the
voters. If Mr Major is the man who will lead the Tories into the
election, then the whole Government must be undermined.
Mr Major has a similar problem, still 25 points behind Labour in the
opinion polls. Blair's command of his party increases, so the competence
of his whole alternative administration must be ridiculed. The Tories
had several goes at this in Blackpool, but they did not quite come off.
They have yet to analyse Blair's success against the factor of their 16
years in government and find a way of ridiculing him.
The political spin-doctors may have had their heyday. They can only do
so much in casting their leaders in the best possible light. The public
is likely to start thinking seriously about who can improve their lives
in ways that they want them to be improved. And that means the parties
must divulge more of their policies. We were promised much more of this
at both Labour and Tory conferences, but that promise was barely
fulfilled.
Mr Blair does not count on his present 25-point lead and Mr Major has
shown that he has by no means given up the ghost. If the voters' mood is
beginning to crystalise and if there is a General Election next year, it
could be won or lost before Christmas.
It is all very well for Mr Paddy Ashdown, for the Liberal Democrats,
to yearn for a basis of political consensus and for the Tory back
bencher George Walden to argue elegantly that without such a consensus
Britian will fail. They forget that the British electorate tends to vote
with its pocket, its heart, and its head -- in that order and not the
reverse. There is quite a long line of ex-Prime Ministers and ex-party
leaders who have learned this the hard way.
So one has to make an argument for the full-confrontation, political
point-scoring that both Mr Major and Mr Blair are obliged to deploy in
the Commons and elsewhere. One of them will form the next government and
both of them are obliged to soften the edges of a decision made by the
voters who will put one of them into No 10.
This is not necessarily a matter of the alternative Prime Ministers
deceiving the public, more a matter of whether the public wants to
deceive itself in facing up to life's hard realities. To be fair to Mr
Walden (who resigned, disillusioned, as an Education Minister under
Margaret Thatcher), he is attempting to educate the public rather than
the politicians about these realities.
The basis of his thesis is that if Britain is to compete and survive
as a modern economy, with all the benefits accruing that we take for
granted, it has to compete globally in all areas, particularly in good
education for all. This means much lower taxation accompanied by much
greater welfare sacrifices by the middle classes is vital. He cites hip
operations as an example. Those who can afford it should pay half the
cost, he says.
The middle classes will probably decide the result of the next
election and they are much courted by Mr Major and Mr Blair. If either
were to echo Mr Walden's argument, the middle classes might take a very
stern view of the sacrifices being offered to them. Self-interest
prevails and the voters are scary of agreeing to one set of sacrifices
only to find that others are heaped on top.
Mr Major and Mr Blair have to ease the nation into handing over power
next time. Vision, sincerity, charisma, and cunning all have a part to
play as well as the what's-in-it-for-me? factor. But in the next few
months it is Blair's chief job to force an election sooner than Major
wants it. It is Major's chief job to prevent this initiative being taken
from him -- and run the country better at the same time.
The game is on for the main players. That is the political reality,
despite (and in defiance of) the virtual reality that the peripheral
participants would like to see. The electorate can change this any time
it really wants to do so.

NOT at all before time our right honourable and learned friends have
slung off their wigs, picked up their pens, and come out fighting
against wanton vandalism. For what else can you call the piecemeal
dismantlement of the legal system at the hands of politicians whose
overweening desire to increase their conference adulation quotient
allows them to take an axe to the very foundations of British justice?
And I use the word British advisedly since the recent pronouncements of
the Scottish Secretary make it plain that our own legal system will no
longer provide immunity against the loopier pronouncements of ambitious
Home Secretaries.
The Lord Chief Justice in England, and former Scottish
Solicitor-General Lord McCluskey have now both made powerful speeches
indicating their concern that penal policy has become little more than a
series of knee-jerk responses to perceived public concerns.
Most people who tuned into the variety acts at the Winter Gardens in
Blackpool last week were disposed to conclude that the wackiest
performance came from Senor Portillo whose personalised land of hope and
glory was clearly the product of a heavily over-taxed imagination. And
certainly it was an entertainment which heroically repelled logic and
stood foursquare against the onslaught of anything resembling factual
material. In short, Mr Portillo made a very silly speech.
But given that nobody not popping the conference happy pills could
take it seriously, it was not, in my book, nearly as alarming as the
gospel according to his Home Office colleague Michael Howard. Mr Howard
is armed and extremely dangerous and society should very properly be
scared of him. His arsenal bristles with half-baked schemes borrowed
pick-and-mix fashion from abroad. And, purely for his own
self-glorification, he has spent the past two conferences serving them
up, while that familiar self-satisfied smirk frames the delivery. These
schemes have many things in common, principally that they have already
failed in their country of origin, and that his civil servants, charged
with investigating their possible import, have already told him so.
Just as the commission he himself set up to examine other proposed
changes advised him that in their very considered and extremely learned
opinion it would be folly to dispense with the important legal safeguard
of a right to silence.
Such is Mr Howard's arrogance, such is his determination to hang on to
a post where he has served with a unique lack of distinction, that he
will say or do anything that will win enough cheap plaudits to keep him
in business.
If he does have a talent within penal policy it is for identifying a
process almost guaranteed to exacerbate the problem he addresses.
Setting aside that sentencing policy should very obviously be a matter
for the man or woman on the Bench who has had an opportunity to examine
the evidence in detail, careering through the parole structure is
another recipe for disaster.
Just like the rest of us, criminals are individuals. You cannot
therefore make sweeping assumptions about their readiness for release.
You can, on the other hand, guarantee that men from whom all hope of
early release has been removed, men with absolutely nothing to lose but
their boredom, will ultimately create the kind of havoc we had begun to
see the end of in Scottish jails.
The latest moves on compulsory random drug tests are a further
illustration of how high-profile initiatives offering publicity
opportunities for Ministers can be spectacularly counterproductive. As
the Scottish Secretary was doubtless aware, there was already an acute
perception of the extent of drug misuse in prison, and an acceptance
that some form of testing might be inevitable. Much time and effort had
therefore been expended devising a low-key means of doing this which
would neither alienate the staff nor inflame the inmates. At a stroke
this softly-softly strategy has been sabotaged, and most people within
the system now fear a considerable backlash.
The huge irony of Ministers making strident pronouncements about how
the balance of policy must shift from the criminal to the victim, is
that most of these policies are designed to create more victims. Not
wilfully so, of course, but that will be the net result.
The real failures in our penal policy have to do with matters Mr
Howard has yet to raise on a conference platform. He continues to assert
that prison works when a truly terrifying rate of recidivism makes a
spectacular mockery of any such conclusion.
A prison system which works does not welcome back over eight out of
ten of its inmates after further offending.
Stiff sentences will send a clear signal to the criminal, he intones.
Not nearly as powerful a signal as the common knowledge that they have
around a four-in-five chance of not being caught burgling your house or
making off with your motor. If thieving is your trade, these are pretty
good odds.
Lord McCluskey described the process of locking up more and more
people for a wide spectrum of non-violent crime as mere warehousing. The
Americans, for whose gimmicky initiatives Mr Howard has much enthusiasm,
know all about that.
This summer the distinguished theatre director Peter Sellers arrived
from his Los Angeles base with the depressing announcement that the
Californian capital had just closed another 37 medical facilities but
had opened yet more new jails.
They like jails in California. Just like Mr Howard, and now,
apparently, Mr Forsyth, they want more and more of them.
Los Angeles, Mr Howard, does not strike me as one of the world's more
desirable role models for a law-abiding, neighbourly society.

DOES a TV licence cover a family who visit their holiday home,
probably twice a year? Is it necessary to have a separate TV licence for
the holiday home -- which may be occupired only two or three times in
the year?
This assumes that the occupiers' main home in unoccupied during their
sojourn at their holiday home and they are in possession of a current TV
licence.
The TV authorities, although great collectors of money, certainly do
not spread their knowledge on how to retain it.

THE debate about Scotland's ability to progress economically following
independence has been most interesting and I am grateful for the
coverage you have given it. Since I am not an ''economist'', however,
there is one thing which continues to puzzle me.
Those who would detract from the case of independence, whether with
what they call evidence or without, always seem to ignore what to me is
a vital factor. That is the existence, throughout northern Europe, of a
large number of small economies based on populations similar to
Scotland's but without natural resources.
I name two: Norway, which is outwith the European Union, and Denmark,
which is within the European Union.
How do the Norwegians and Danes do it? Why are their economies not in
the ruinous state which these people confidently predict Scotland's will
fall into post-independence?
What is the flaw in our situation which predetermines disaster but
does not do the same for all of Scandinavia? I don't understand.
Indeed, I'm afraid that the people whose case concerns me have been
brainwashed by the many years of confidence bashing which Westminster
Governments have indulged in towards the Scots.
Hopefully one day the prophets of doom will wake up and notice that
all these other small countries have relatively successful economies
while ours is relatively unsuccessful.

THE promise made at the Conservative Party Conference to deal more
severely with second offenders has met with the usual instant and
predictable response, both north and south of the Border. But we should
look carefully at the nature of that response, because it is symptomatic
of the reponse that meets every Government proposal.
Is it, in this case, because the judges fear massive injustice will be
done to the criminal? It would appear not. Instead they are more
concerned about their rights and their freedom of manoeuvre. They see
their position being eroded.
In this particular instance can anyone seriously argue against tougher
sentences for the persistent offender?
Of course our prisons are overcrowded. More must be done by way of
rehabilitation and I would certainly agree that many of the people who
are in prison for minor offences, such as non-payment of fines, should
not be there, but that is not the issue in this particular debate.
Equally we all agree the police should spend more time on the beat and
less in court. But it has to be asked just who is it who is keeping them
in the court waiting-rooms? Has the legal profession no hand in this
waste of police time?
The Prime Minister spoke on October 13 of taking risks. Well, no-one,
who thinks about it, can deny that this Government, first under Mrs
Thatcher and now John Major, have taken risks. By taking risks I mean
introducing reforms which have had the side-effect of offending vested
interests and thus generating a storm of protest with resulting
political damage.
The intention has not been to offend, but offence has been taken
because there is no way of introducing reform without hurting the
feelings of at least some of those involved. There never is, and most of
us know that from our own experience in our own lives.
The list of controversial reforms is a long one; the trade unions, the
nationalised industries, the teachers, the armed forces. I was a member
of the latter and saw from inside just how powerful vested interests can
be.
The health service and now the law have all come under the spotlight.
Taking the health service as an example, who can seriously suggest that
the changing face of health care, in its widest sense, is not the
driving force behind the need for reform?
The increasing cost and the widening availability of more specialised
treatment, the ageing population and a hospital structure not suited to
modern medicine are just some of the things which have imposed this need
for reform.
For evidence that all these reforms were necessary and have been
successful we need look no further than ''New Labour'', who have already
made it clear that, should they ever come into power, most of the
reforms will remain in place broadly as they are. This despite, as the
Prime Minister said in his conference speech, the Labour Party, in
Parliament, having opposed every one every inch of the way.
There is certainly a place for the lobbyist and for the special
interest group and of course for the Opposition to oppose, but the
balance has swung too much in their favour.
There is a need for more objective reporting, comment, and analysis.
We must get away from the knee-jerk response to each and every proposal
for change.
Not everything the Government has done has worked smoothly; not
everything has been right first time. Their presentation of policies has
often been cack-handed, but they have not flinched. They have stuck to
their principles.
Contrast that with New Labour who rush to support any special-interest
group who feel threatened and who will abandon any policy, forget any
principle, and ditch any individual in their pursuit of power.

IN the construction industry some companies are changing their working
practices by dispensing with employers and hiring Labour Only
Sub-Contractors (LOSCs), a move which results in significant savings for
such companies.
Freed from employers' National Insurance contributions, sick pay,
holiday pay, travel expenses, redundancy payments, etc, even the threat
of industrial tribunals, they can undercut employers who still recognise
and meet these costs.
However the day may well come when the latter has to adopt the working
practices of the former simply to remain in business with the loser
being the operatives who will be required to bid against each other in
an effort to secure an income.
The resultant pressures can only be downwards.
Should a national minimum wage come about, as LOSCs are not paid
wages, there will be an accelerating trend towards the use of LOSCs, so
negating the concept behind any such legislation.

I HOPE that the (Labour) political career of Alan Howarth is going to
be a very short one.
As a long-serving member of the Labour Party, I trust that
constituency selection committees will not opt for Mr Howarth in
preference to some of the hard-working genuine Labour supporters who
have worked long and hard to see a Labour Government elected.
Never have we witnessed such a hypocritical act centred mainly, I
fear, on self-survival and not on some change of heart as Mr Howarth
would have us believe.
I do not see ''New Labour'' as being remotely similar to any of the
last four Tory regimes. How many times in recent years did Mr Howarth
side with the Opposition in highly publicised matters such as VAT on
fuel, the EC Social Chapter, the huge and immoral earnings of privatised
utilities chiefs, etc?
I would have had much more respect for Alan Howarth if he had simply
announced his resignation from public office and not attempted to insult
the intelligence of true Labour supporters.

One of the splendours of Orkney, that fragmented jigsaw of emerald
isles bobbing around in the North Sea, is its wildlife. It is positively
crawling with all manner of furry and feathered creatures, either
peculiar to the place or particular about where they live, having
migrated there to be far from the madding crowd.
Approaching the islands by air, one may discern beaches and rocky
coves littered with what looks suspiciously like dead sheep. In fact
they are seals, hundreds of 'em, lazing around and making more seals.
And in Kirkwall there is a road sign that one does not see often. It
says: ''Otters crossing next 600 yards''. It came as no surprise last
week to overhear a taxi driver in the town confiding how a pheasant
inadvertently ended up in his kitchen after straying in front of his
vehicle.
Get the point? The place is stuffed with fauna, which is a source of
local pride as well as pleasure. So when aspersions are cast on the
ancestry of the star attraction of the islands' wildlife, there is bound
to be a row.
It duly erupted recently after no less an authority than the Times
reported that the Orkney vole could no longer be considered as Britain's
only true native mammal. It quoted Dr Peter Reynolds, an animal
ecologist with Scottish Natural Heritage, claiming fossils had exposed
the species Microtus arvalis orcadensis as ''an alien incomer'' that had
arrived in Britain with sea-faring Bronze Age man.
Not content with being the bearer of bad tidings, the newspaper
mourned the loss of the stout little fellow's claim to fame in an
editorial. ''Other typical British mammals, such as bulldogs, red
squirrels, Scotch terriers, and the Scots themselves are immigrants, and
biologically identical to their continental cousins,'' it said. ''But
the Orkney vole was supposed to be something else.''
The legendary fighting spirit of the islands was roused immediately --
we're talking here about a slight against the descendants of Norse earls
such as King Magnus Barelegs, and the fearful Thorfinn I Skullsplitter.
The Orcadian, a splendid journal published weekly in Kirkwall, rose to
the challenge and happily found a champion in none other than Dr
Reynolds, the scientist who caused the fuss in the first place.
The importance of being earnest about the Orkney vole was demonstrated
by the editor's decision to splash a riposte over four columns at the
top of the front page. It was, as the headline stated, a question of
honour.
And now the good news: Dr Reynolds, who spent three years studying the
Orkney vole for a PhD doctorate at Aberdeen University, averred that the
Times report had been misleading. There had been an ''unfortunate
misrepresentation'' of what he had said in a speech to the Mammal
Society at his Alma Mater, entitled ''The Orkney Vole: The Ecology of a
Neolithic Ferrylouper''.
In fact, he insisted, good old M A Orcadensis was a pretty unique
character wherever it had come from, since it had been found nowhere
else in the world. So as far as anybody knew it was still a breed apart
and peculiar to Orkney. For a start it was up to double the size of
mainland Britain's short-tailed field voles, weighing up to 90gms, and
had a different pattern of teeth. And more importantly, the question of
its ancestry was still shrouded in mystery.
Archaelogical excavations at Skara Brae and the Holm of Papa Westray
had revealed vole bone fragments which corresponded in age to the dates
of earliest human settlements. This suggested, according to Dr Reynolds,
that the furry wee creatures came from continental Europe with the first
human settlers some 5000 years ago (which was before the Egyptians got
the notion to build pyramids). ''The Orkney vole is still very, very
special,'' he concluded reassuringly. ''It has evolved into this very
special form which is an integral part of Orkney's ecology and
culture.''
So even if they did come over with the Ur-Norsemen who built the
brochs, they clearly have as much right to consider themselves true
Brits -- and Orcadians in particular -- as anybody else. The prospect of
them being expelled as illegal immigrants by xenophobes at the Home
Office is thus removed. This will come as good news to hen harriers,
kestrels, and short-eared owls throughout Orkney, for whom M A
Orcadensis play a vital role in the food chain.
Which leaves only one question unresolved -- why do otters cross the
road in Kirkwall? Presumably the answer is that given local affection
for all creatures great and small, it is safe to do so.

THE grievous death of James Murray adds yet another name to the list
of men killed recently in the ring. An immediate consequence of his
tragic death, not surprisingly, is a renewed demand for boxing to be
banned. Put bluntly, the argument is unanswerable. Boxers fight to win.
Whatever regulations may be imposed, they strike as hard as they can to
achieve that end. Repeated blows to the head can cause permanent brain
damage, and sometimes a single punch can be fatal. This is the ground on
which the British Medical Association bases its opposition to boxing,
and the hard evidence cannot be refuted.
The assertions that if boxing were outlawed it would go underground,
or that some British boxers would go abroad, are both irrelevant in the
face of the medical evidence. In defence of boxing, it may be claimed
that in some other sports the injury lists and the death tolls are even
higher; but there is a crucial difference. Professional boxing is an
activity in which the contenders set out to inflict damage on each
other. It is on this fact that the big business of boxing is organised,
and on which it is accepted -- and even, sometimes, relished -- by its
audience. There are many sports in which injury is a likely outcome, and
where even the outside possibility of death may have to be considered.
The risks are accepted as part of the game. Bruises, bloody noses,
broken bones, and sometimes worse are the inevitable consequence of
vigorous contact sports like football and rugby. Ski slopes are,
metaphorically, littered with accident victims. Every year a score or so
climbers die on Scottish mountains, and the Alpine figures are far
greater. It is only in occasional extreme cases, as with Alison
Hargreaves who died on K2 this year, that questions are raised about the
ethics of risk-taking. Yet while it is true that boxers choose to fight,
glory in their skill and prowess, and clearly relish the challenge of
the ring, the fact remains that what has euphemistically been called the
noble art amounts often to little better than legitimised brutality. The
boxers bear the brunt, but it is society which should feel the shame.
Boxing has travelled a long way from its sickening origins in
prize-fighting. We may look back with horror on those bare-knuckle days
when contestants fought to the bitter end and spectators howled
bloodthirsty approval at the ringside. We live in more enlightened
times. We have medical checks, we have Queensberry rules. Yet there is
something gravely disturbing about our readiness to treat fist-fighting
as an acceptable entertainment -- quite apart from the refinement of
presenting it as a side dish fit to be relished at the dinner table,
along with a rare steak and a glass or two of claret. There is a long
tradition, at least in certain circles, of extolling the merits of
boxing as a character-forming exercise. No less than Nelson Mandela, a
fancied exponent of the art in his younger days, has paid tribute to its
beneficial influence. Born weaklings might disagree. They might also
point to certain other martial arts as being more effective in a tight
corner than a straight left. What links champion boxers to their
counterparts in other athletic fields is their superb physique, their
supreme dedication, their rigorous training, allied to great talent. In
the person of a genius like Muhammad Ali, boxing could almost become
balletic. Unfortunately in this ignoble art the flight of the butterfly
and the sting of the bee mask the crude reality of the final
sledgehammer blow. The Herald has argued in the past for the banning of
boxing; recent tragic events only serve to render the argument
unassailable.

THE opening of the Skye bridge will be remembered for many reasons,
some good and some bad. It is a moment of history, and like other feats
of engineering in Scotland it will be recalled with feelings of pride in
technical achievement many times in the future. It is a defining moment
in the history of Skye, no longer to be an island reached by the
romantic, if brief, route of a ferry crossing. Skye will never be the
same again, and though this will be a matter of regret for some
islanders, and perhaps for visitors as well, the advantages of driving
to the island in preference to crossing slowly and sometimes unsteadily
on a ferry are obvious. Other islands around the Scottish coast may look
with envy on the bridge, particularly because of the fearsome rates
charged by mainland haulage companies when delivering often essential
goods by ferry. Since a road equalisation tariff scheme appears to be a
lost dream for Scotland's islanders a bridge, where feasible, should be
the best way to reduce the penalty of living in relative isolation. For
Skye's 9000 residents and countless visitors life will be easier and
safer, as was demonstrated by the early and temporary opening of the
bridge recently to allow an ambulance to cross for an emergency. Nor
does the Skye bridge constitute the dreadful concrete blot on the
landscape which was feared by many. It is slim, tasteful, and quite
incapable of upstaging the magnificence of the scenery which surrounds
it.
Thus the bridge linking Skye to the mainland has many commendable
features. Unfortunately, it has also generated bitter controversy and
brought considerable ill-feeling to the island. This is because of the
manner in which the project was conceived and financed, and the way in
which it will be run. There is little doubt that Skye would still be
waiting for a bridge if the funding were to have come from the public
purse. This allowed those in favour of private financing of large
capital projects to propose a scheme through which a consortium would
finance and build the bridge and recoup its costs by charging tolls. By
this means the bridge was built, though in the face of determined
opposition from many local campaigners who objected to what will be
their lifeline to the mainland being run by a private company intent on
recovering, in less than 25 years, its investment plus interest.
In several respects the campaigners' worst fears have been realised.
The tolls to be charged are the highest in Britain, and very probably in
Europe. This seems a harsh imposition on a small community where most
people work in tourism-related businesses. Just as objectionable, and
quite counter to the ideology which propelled the bridge in the first
place, is the fact that the consortium operating the business has a
monopoly. This is because the Scottish Office insisted on the withdrawal
of the ferry which ran between roughly the same points as the bridge. A
ferry in the future may not be impossible but at the moment the odds are
stacked heavily against it. Through the intervention of the Secretary of
State for Scotland the excessively heavy toll for small commercial
vehicles, which represented a lapse into the deepest stupidity by the
operating company, was withdrawn; for that the islanders should be glad.
The Skye bridge is now a fact of life. Its benefits can and should be
enjoyed without necessarily compromising deeply-felt objections.

soon. And the white man is not going to stop us executing the law of God
on all of you who fall under our jurisdiction'' -- Louis Farrakhan in
1984.
He was referring to a black reporter who had quoted Jesse Jackson
saying New York was ''Hymietown''. Farrakhan plans to lead a Million
Black Men on a march through Washington today.
He won't get his million, but he will get a huge number, and it is
quite possible that he will emerge at the end of the day as the most
important black leader in the country.
Since he is a racist, anti-Semitic demagogue, that is bad news for the
black population of America. Two weeks after O J Simpson was acquitted
of murder, the demonstration will exacerbate white suspicions of blacks
and drive an even deeper wedge between the races.
This is just fine with Minister Farrakhan (that is how he likes to be
known). He is a separatist: he wants to set up a black republic on the
present territory of the United States, and no doubt would practise
vigorous ethnic cleansing to ensure the racial purity of the land he
claims.
''We want our people in America whose parents or grandparents were
descendants of slaves to be allowed to establish a separate state or
territory of their own -- either on this continent or elsewhere . . . We
believe that inter-marriage or race-mixing should be prohibited''
(1992).
At least that's what he says. Since there is no remote chance that he
will obtain any such thing, or the alternative, a black American
homeland in Africa, it is always possible that he makes the assertion to
improve his power in the black community.
Certainly the Million Man March will serve the same effect.
Black leaders all over the country are coming, while offering feeble
reasons for dissociating themselves from Farrakhan. They have noticed
that he has struck a chord, and fear to be left behind.
Jesse Jackson, who is being eclipsed by Farrakhan, and Colin Powell,
the former general who may run for President, are two who have
compromised with Mr Farrakhan, to preserve their credibility with the
mass of black Americans who support the idea of the march.
Black women, of course, have a different perspective. They will stay
at home. The Nation of Islam believes in keeping women in their place,
and homosexuals, too.
Farrakhan, who is now 62, was born Louis Walcott in the Bronx. He
became a follower of Malcolm X, the fiery leader of the Nation of Islam,
in the 1960s, but turned against Malcolm when he reconciled himself with
main-line Muslim groups. The Nation's inspiration, Elijah Mohammed,
claimed that he was a second prophet, a heresy that cut the Nation off
completely from ordinary Muslims.
There was a constant thread of violence in the movement.
Malcolm was murdered (his daughter accused Farrakhan of complicity in
the killing) and in 1977 extremists seized several buildings in
Washington, including a Jewish organisation and city hall. Several
people were killed or injured.
Farrakhan insists that he is a loyal Muslim (the call to the march
began with the invocation ''In the name of God the compassionate . . .''
which rather put off black Christians). He is also a conservative,
old-fashioned, ''pull 'em up by the bootstraps'' preacher.
The Nation tries to improve the lot of blacks by preaching discipline
and abstinence from drugs. The Nation will supply its own militants to
police dangerous black neighbourhoods or schools, often with striking
results. The uniform is smart: suits, bow ties, and sunglasses.
The trouble is that Mr Farrakhan's rhetoric is hot and violent: ''The
Jews don't like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that's a good
name. Hitler was a very great man'' (1984).
''We know that the Jews are the most organised, rich, and powerful
people, not only in America but in the world. They're plotting against
us even as we speak'' (1994).
''Caucasians, you are more than racist. You have deprived the human
family of the natural right of truth and self-determination. I am not a
racist . . .'' (1994).
He once referred to Judaism as a ''gutter religion'' and has never
convincingly repudiated aides who are far more viciously anti-Semitic
even than he is.
He also says that blacks must recover their self-respect if they are
ever to break out of the cycle of poverty and misery in which many of
them live. A third of all black men between the ages of 21 and 29 are
either in jail, on bail, on probation, or awaiting trial. The way to
reverse that horrible statistic is to offer them some alternative to
petty drug dealing.
Whether marching through Washington will help is a different matter.
But it will certainly help push Minister Farrakhan to the top of the
heap. The last great march here was led by Martin Luther King, who
preached that he had a dream of an America where race no longer counted.
Things have changed since then.

Retired executives are in demand for work abroad. Chris Holme looks at
the array of exotic options
THE world can still be the oyster for Scottish executives shunted into
redundancy or retirement. There are those whose horizons stretch beyond
the garden shed or 19th hole after a busy career, and it is this group
which is being targeted by the British Executive Services Overseas
(BESO) when it is formally relaunched in Scotland by its patron, the
Princess Royal, at Holyroodhouse later this month.
To date, Scotland has 141 BESO volunteers. Their expertise ranges from
drystane dyking to steel production in Gaza and commercial markets for
rambutans in Guatemala. The latest batch are now posted to Poland,
Latvia, Albania, Zimbabwe, and Senegal.
But the figure is woefully short of the UK average, according to
Scottish BESO chairman Sir Lewis Robertson. He was hauled in to give the
organisation a boost, drawing on his experience both as a businessman,
company doctor, and Scottish chairman of the British Council.
''There is an awful lot of people of retirement age who feel they have
a lot left to give but they find there's nothing else to do apart from
the garden,'' Sir Lewis said.
BESO alternatives to the executive knacker's yard can be exotic
beezers. Its assignments cover the globe, from help for small businesses
in Vanuatu, sustainable tourism in Barbados, pollution control in El
Salvador, and making ice cream in China.
It has similar aims to Voluntary Service Overseas, which takes people
up to the age of 70, but its assignments tend to be shorter (typically
six weeks) and more orientated to business development. One third of its
work is in the former Eastern bloc countries, where its particular
skills are in great demand.
Volunteers have their travel and housing paid and a modest allowance
provided by their host.
As a charity, BESO's aims are fundamentally altruistic, in passing on
First World expertise to developing countries, but it doesn't turn its
nose up at any commercial spin-offs for Britain in the form of orders
for spares or equipment.
Robertson, still very much active at the age of 72, is conscious of
the ageism which has infected British business. He has a passion for
Italian history and should know the value the Venetian state placed on
wisdom acquired through age. No young whippersnappers were eligible for
the office of doge or chief magistrate until they reached 70.
''Part of the whole social system should be the passing on of skills
from older people to younger people in their own environment or from
developed countries to the less developed,'' he said.
''Retirement needs to be thought out and planned for. The curtain
should not come down with a crash on the sixty-fifth birthday and leave
nothing constructive to do.''
Like most Western organisations, BESO runs the risk of being accused
of neo-colonialism or as a cover for commercial or state espionage.
Sir Lewis, a former intelligence officer, is conscious of these
charges, but rejects them. The small-scale nature of BESO projects would
render them useless for any attempts at spying and, furthermore,
requests for help come from the countries themselves.
Similarly, he argues that the application process eliminates the
unsuitable candidate, including the sort of pompous has-beens who might
give the whole scheme a bad name.
Robertson is now after Scottish companies to come up with sponsorship
for BESO. If not simply out of the goodness of the corporate heart, they
could assist in offering a redundant or retired employee another option
with the possibility of something more than a thank-you letter from the
overseas recipient.
Lists of volunteers are matched to the requirements of jobs as they
come in. The organisation is equally keen on recruiting women, even if
its acronym might bestow on them the unfortunate label of besom.
Kenn Jones, 62, from Dunfermline, has been in constant demand since he
retired as managing director of a textile factory in Zimbabwe in 1987.
''When I came back to the UK, there was no future in textiles in
Europe, not in Britain anyway. In a sense, it has been an ideal
situation for me and there is great job satisfaction,'' he said.
He'd already travelled the world in his work, so the prospect of
packing his suitcase was not daunting. So far he has completed 25 BESO
assignments from China to Lesotho and also works as a consultant to the
United Nations.
By the time he gets back he sometimes has the chance to go round the
shops to see the padded shirts and other items he'd helped to bring into
production in Indonesian mills the previous year.
''It's hard to say what you will have to do. Sometimes it is
management difficulty, sometimes a technical, marketing, or
entrepreneurial problem. I certainly have learned a great deal myself.''
Enough, in fact, to write a book on the textile industry, which he is
currently doing.
''It is a completely different ball game from the humdrum life of
running a company on a daily basis to going out and solving individual
problems. You are very much on your own.''
The BESO Scottish office is at 13 Bank Street, Edinburgh, EH1 2LN
(0131 220 0012).

Herald pop and rock reviewer John Williamson has organised Glasgow's
current Ten Day Weekend, which has redefined the role of the civic
authorities in promoting music
TEN Day Weekend emerged from 1995's year-long Sound City events, the
city's response to being awarded a week-long title by the music industry
and BBC Radio One. It was a year's worth of numerous successes, moments
of artistic genius (the contributions of Throwing Muses, Anthony H
Wilson, Jarvis Cocker, John Peel spring to mind) through to the
comically disastrous (over which it is kinder to draw a veil).
At the end of it all, the event's main funders, Glasgow District
Council, and its main beneficiaries (local promoters, bands, and labels)
agreed that it would be a good idea to repeat the exercise, a sure sign
that the early sniping and the mistrust of the council's involvement in
pop music (described elsewhere as ''Civil Service rock'') had been
overcome.
Indeed, it is the relationship of the Ten Day Weekend with its main
funder which has become its greatest strength. Operating independently
within the Department of Performing Arts, The Ten Day Weekend has in
most instances over-ridden the usual backstabbing that singles out any
artistic scene.
It may have taken time, but the council is no longer perceived as a
threat to existing businesses. Indeed, its contribution through the
vehicle of an apparently non-civic organisation like the Ten Day Weekend
is positively advantageous. Which other city council is co-funding
releases and shows by groups like The Nectarine No.9 and The Leopards.
By mid March, it was decided that a 10-day event in October was the
best way to attract the attention of the public and media on what was
happening musically in Glasgow. It was a peak time for touring acts, the
students were back, and it was a school holiday, so the dates picked
themselves.
The name did not. The first major crisis facing the 1995 festival was
finding a name for it: several indecisive committee meetings later and
Ten Day Weekend emerged as the only usable idea from the collective
thinkpower of the local music scene. If finding a name took an eternity,
it was nothing compared to some of the other dilemmas that faced us as
the programme evolved, necessarily involving the combined XL-sized egos
of bands and their corporate PRs.
Musically, the event makes a strong statement about the current good
health of the local music scene. The curious should sample the triple
bill of Nectarine No.9, BIS, and Hardbody at King Tut's on Thursday or
the maverick genius of Swelling Meg at the same venue the night before.
Something more refined can be found with the Bathers who are at Tramway
all week or the Painted Word, Sugartown, or Lies Damp Lies who all
feature at The Arches.
These are some of the musical highlights. Radio support, the bedrock
of Sound City's success, has also been extended. Not only has Radio
Clyde come on board with substantial financial and on-air support for
the event, but rivalries have been put aside to allow a meaningful
involvement from Radio Scotland and Radio One, both of whom are
recording Scottish bands at King Tut's and putting their performances
out nationally. Such a triumph for diplomacy could never have been
achieved by a commercial organisation.
Away from the performances, Ten Day Weekend is infinitely more diverse
than its predecessor. 13.Net at the 13th Note is Glasgow's first
cybercafe; the seminars which run every day at the GFT aim to demystify
and encourage debates about the music business. Elsewhere, respected
musicians like Ewan Vernal, Nigel Clark, Chick Lyall, and Mick Slaven
will be passing on their considerable playing expertise.
Art and films have also become part of the festival. The NME Exposed!
exhibition of work by that publication's renowned photographers at The
Arches is surely one of the highlights of the whole event. Along with
the appearance of legendary American record producer Gary Katz, who
speaks at the GFT on Friday at 1pm, it is an example of the type of
event which can happen only with public funding.
The Ten Day Weekend has purposely set out to use its resources to
provide music events that would never otherwise happen in Glasgow. The
compilation of such a diverse programme is the first part in justifying
its existence. A healthy public response will be the next step in
developing what should be an important and respected event both locally
and, hopefully in time, internationally.
The first Ten Day Weekend may have been limited by its novelty -- and
by some of the preconceptions that people brought to it -- but not for a
moment by its ambition.

Chief Constable Roy Cameron said part of the reason for the increase
was the three-month anti-drugs campaign, Operation Rumble. The force has

With the arrival of Perudo in Glasgow, John Linklater throws himself
into the game that encourages participants to lie in their teeth
THE second most addictive thing to come out of South America is the
way Stephen Fry describes it. He is a helpless aficionado. So is Sting
and Richard Branson. Royalty play it. Supermodels play it. Perudo has
some encouraging elements: deceptively facile enough for a novice to
baffle a pro, a dice game that encourages you to lie through your teeth,
as harmless as cribbage or as vicious as poker. A game of luck with the
illusion of cunning, or a game of cunning with the illusion of luck?
The chance to shoot some Perudo came on Wednesday night. It was a
first in Glasgow. The event was scheduled as a regional qualifier for
the national championships to be staged later this year in London. The
winner and partner would be flown down to participate. That was fine.
The only preliminary problem was they had to teach us all how to play
before it got underway.
We were fortunate in being coached by the man who brought the game to
Britain from Peru in 1989. After six years of hustling it in fashionable
London clubs and marketing his own version in expensive limited
editions, Cosmo Fry has just sold Perudo to Parker Brothers, the world's
biggest games manufacturer. That is like throwing five sixes.
Which may or may not be an advantage in Perudo. As we learned, it's
not what your dice say that counts, it's what you say they say. Yours
and everyone elses. It is about calculating the odds, backing a hunch to
bid, brazening it out.
The original version, said to have been refined by Atahualpa in the
sixteenth century and taught to Pizzaro, is called Dudo, from the
Spanish for ''I doubt'', which is how your bluff is called in the game.
When Cosmo Fry and his Peruvian partner Alfredo Fernandini tried to
register it as Dudo, they ran into copyright problems with Cleudo and
Ludo. Perudo adds a necessary syllable, and acknowledges the provenance.
''It's simple, there's no board,'' was the way Cosmo introduced it.
''It has a global appeal, no language problems. It lends itself to
tournaments like this. It's not a cerebral game. It thrives on
interaction and distraction and drunken loutish behaviour. It's a lot of
fun.''
''Are you making this up as you go along?'' queried Tom Shields, who
was really there to improve his Spanish. ''I used to,'' admitted Alfredo
casually. ''Now it's all written down in the rules that Parker Brothers
supply with the game.'' Jack McLean, another gamester, kept losing his
dice. Under the table, beaten on the bluff, or just unable to keep
score, it didn't matter. He went palafico, which means he was down to
his last dice from five. Then he went out.
''You're too aggressive, Jack,'' was Alfredo's assessment of his game.
Jack turned moodily on his whisky, throwing out some offending ice.
Cubes with numbers on them, or cubes that ruin your drink, they don't
stay long around Jack.
At the next table they hadn't quite got the dudo bit right. They must
have been playing the Campdown Races version, with a Doodah! Doodah!
ringing out with every challenge. Others were not to be drawn from their
normal pursuits on the Wednesday games night at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut.
A heated game of Mousey Mousey was in progress in one corner, and it has
to be admitted that photographer Paul Hackett and I slinked off for a
game of Subbuteo table football to check if any of the old skills were
still there.
But the elimination tournament to find a national finalist got
underway. We were depressed to discover among the competitors a fellow
called William from Bogota. His first stab at Perudo, was the unlikely
claim from Bogota Billy, evidently a consummate liar and therefore a
rival to be feared. He made the final. The Herald's representatives,
quite unable to dissemble or sink to the required level of mendacity,
had the honour to be the first trio eliminated at their respective
tables.
In a heated finale Ian Smith, a manager of a broker company, raised
his arms aloft after seeing off all rivals to gain the first Scottish
championship. His winning game plan: ''Roll the dice and bluff.'' He
will be among 300 finalists in London, when the clatter of 15,000 dice
will add percussion to live South American music as the socialites,
stars, and trend-setters prepare to receive a challenge from a new wave
of Perudo players.
They say it is a great game for gloaters, where the naive can humble
the sophisticates. That never worked for us, but maybe it will work for
Ian Smith.

THE cost of living is rising faster in Scotland than anywhere else in
Britain -- but the quality of life is still the best.
An annual survey of prices -- from haircuts to ham sandwiches -- shows
shops and services north of the Border have risen 4.7% in the past year.
The news is even worse for those living in Lerwick -- their prices are
the highest of anywhere in the United Kingdom. The Shetland town takes
over from Chingford, in east London, as the most expensive place to go
shopping in the UK.
The yearly cost of buying a basket of goods and services in Lerwick is
#10,103 compared to the national average of #9354.
Scotland's 4.7% shopping bill rise is 1% higher than the national
average and three times as high as the 1.5% rise in Northern England.
The figures, from pay analysts Reward, do not include property prices,
local and national taxes, and council rents.
Taking those into account, the average Scottish family needs to bring
in an extra 4.9% in wages to maintain last year's standard of living.
It is not all gloom, however. Scotland still has the best quality of
life, according to Reward, thanks to higher than average wages.
Based on the difference between average salaries and average costs of
living, Scotland gets a ''quality of life'' rating of 5.4.
In South-east England, where more people are living in negative equity
and rents have soared, the rating is minus 4.4.
Analysts believe the better wages paid in the hi-tech computer
industries in Silicon Glen, plus Aberdeen's oil, have helped push up the
average.
Now shops and services are beginning to realise that there is more
money around so their prices are also going up.
Lerwick has the additional problem of paying a premium for most of its
goods to take into account the extra cost of transport from the
mainland.
Mr Steve Flather of Reward said: ''Taking Scotland as a whole, the
quality of life is traditionally the best or among the best in the UK.
''Of course there are variations across the country and local price
wars and house price movements can present a differing picture.
''Scotland's price rises for goods and services -- which include
everything from a football match ticket to a duvet cover -- have gone up
the most.
''But like most areas of Britain the general rate of price rises is
slower than this time six months ago.
''There is still a lack of the feelgood factor. Many people are still
unemployed or living in property with negative equity.''

CAMPAIGNERS against an electricity cable linking Scotland with
Northern Ireland say the project should be halted because of the recent
incidence of Second World War munitions being washed ashore on the Clyde
coast.
Mr Struan Stevenson, co-ordinator of the Stop The Overhead Powerlines
campaign, has called on the Scottish Secretary to refuse permission for
the project because of the danger posed by munitions on the seabed
between the two countries. ScottishPower wants to put a powerline across
the seabed in order to sell electricity to Northern Ireland.
Mr Stevenson said that laying the connection could dislodge ageing
munitions from the Irish Sea, particularly at Beauforts Dyke, a deep
trench used for dumping. Claims have been made that a gas pipeline being
laid between Scotland and Southern Ireland is responsible for the
present disturbance of munitions.
''Fears about the potential for unleashing an environmental
catastrophe in the North Channel have not been given proper weight,''
said Mr Stevenson yesterday. ''I feel it is incumbent on the Secretary
of State to refuse planning permission on the grounds that any further
disturbance to the seabed near Beauforts Dyke would create a wholly
unjustifiable danger to health.''
Witnesses for ScottishPower at a recent public inquiry into the
proposal said video monitors would be used during the cable laying so
that obstructions would be avoided.

SCOTTISH National Party activist Kenny MacAskill has left the party's
Shadow Cabinet. However, the move is not regarded as a further split
between him and SNP leader Alex Salmond.
Mr MacAskill, SNP national treasurer, wants to free himself from
Cabinet responsibility in order to concentrate on fund-raising, a
crucial role in the run-up to the General Election.
Mr Salmond has already said the SNP must be more professional at the
next election and that would mean more money having to be found to fund
campaigns and put more resources into target constituencies.
Two new faces join Mr Salmond's team. Mr David McCarthy, former
managing director of salmon farming company Marine Harvest, becomes
economic secretary only seven months after joining the party.
The SNP is keen to use his background to convince the business
community that the economic case for independence can be justified.
In addition, Mr Colin Campbell, the retired headteacher who came
second in the Strathclyde West Euro seat this year, takes Mr MacAskill's
defence brief. His task will be to highlight the fact the SNP is the
only major party now committed to removing Trident nuclear submarines
from Scottish waters.
Mr Salmond said yesterday: ''David McCarthy brings a wealth of
practical business experience to the party's economic team and will be
an enormous asset in deploying the business case for independence.''
He also took a swipe at Labour squabbling over gender equality by
pointing out that it was ''particularly pleasing that nine of the SNP's
20 senior spokespeople are women, appointed on merit and endorsed by the
party.
''Perhaps other parties might reflect on the SNP's success in
delivering gender balance both in terms of our spokespeople and also the
party's Westminster and European elected representatives.''
The Nationalists' newest MP, Ms Roseanna Cunningham, continues as
environment spokesperson.

ST JOHNSTONE football club manager Paul Sturrock was recovering in
hospital last night after collapsing at a match on Saturday.
The 39-year-old former Scotland international is believed to have
suffered a heart attack while watching his team play his old club Dundee
United at Tannadice.
Last night, he was still in the coronary care unit at Ninewells
Hospital in Dundee.
Mr Sturrock collapsed with chest pains just after Dundee United netted
the first goal in the 35th minute of the First Division encounter.
Paramedics were called to treat the manager as thousands of shocked
fans watched.
His wife Barbara was at her husband's side as the ambulance took him
to hospital, where doctors yesterday were awaiting the results of tests
on the former striker.
United captain Maurice Malpas, a long-time playing colleague of Mr
Sturrock's at Tannadice, described the shock of seeing his friend being
taken away from the dug-out area on a stretcher.
He said: ''I knew about the commotion but I didn't realise who it was
until the stretcher was taken away. It was very upsetting for his
friends to see Paul being carried away on a stretcher.
''We go back a long way and played together for umpteen years. I think
he's needing a rest but I don't want to speculate about what caused
it.''
A hospital spokeswoman described Mr Sturrock's condition yesterday as
''comfortable and quite stable''.
She said medical staff were waiting for test results and it was not
known whether he had suffered a heart attack. She added: ''Mr Sturrock
just wants to rest.''

MORE than 200 mourners gathered to pay their last respects as former
Prime Minister Lord Home of Hirsel was buried on Saturday beside his
wife in a family plot overlooking the River Tweed and the rolling
Cheviot Hills beyond -- one of his favourite landscapes.
The burial followed a simple half-hour service at St Mary's and All
Souls Church in the Borders town of Coldstream, where Lord Home was a
regular worshipper.
The private service was strictly for members of the family, estate
workers and pensioners, and a few close friends.
The pomp and ceremony for a former Premier will come later, at
memorial services in London and Edinburgh.
Lord Home, who died last Monday aged 92, was Prime Minister from 1963
to 1964.

GREENPEACE said yesterday it was alarmed over the ''bizarre police
harassment'' of an anti-nuclear protester who sent two bottles of wine
and a packet of salt to the French embassy.
Labour MP Calum Macdonald has also demanded an explanation from police
over the treatment given to artist Mrs Meg Mitchell.
Mrs Mitchell, 32, who joined Greenpeace a few weeks ago, was so angry
over the French nuclear testing in the Pacific that she removed
everything French from her remote home in the Outer Hebrides -- the wine
and sea salt -- and sent them to the French Embassy in Edinburgh with a
letter registering her disgust at the nuclear testing.
But embassy staff suspected the package was a bomb and closed the
building. A few days later police visited Mrs Mitchell at her croft on
Great Bernera. She was also warned she would receive a call from Lothian
and Borders Police.
Greenpeace's UK nuclear campaigner, Mr William Peden, said he had
never come across a case like it before.
''It is bizarre and worrying. We are outraged that such a thing has
happened to one of our members. It is completely over the top,'' he
said.
Western Isles MP Calum Macdonald said: ''Like many other people, she
has made a legitimate protest. But unlike many people she has been
subject to an absurd abuse of power.
''It was quite clear that this could not even be construed as a
pretend bomb. So why does she get this kind of heavy-handed treatment? I
find it almost unbelievable. I want to know from the police on whose
intructions were they acting.''
Lothian and Borders Police, who asked officers in the Western Isles to
check Mrs Mitchell, defended their action.
''The package looked suspicious. Her name and address were on the
outside of the parcel and we wanted to make sure she was the person who
had sent it before opening it,'' said a spokeswoman.

<HEADLINE>Forsyth faces Skye ceremony snub. Councillors to lead protest as bridge opens</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975864081</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
OPPONENTS of the Skye bridge and its toll charges plan to embarrass
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth and cross the controversial #25m
structure without paying minutes after its official opening today.
The protesters, calling themselves SKAT, or Skye and Kyle Against
Tolls, will be led by Skye and Lochalsh district councillor Gavin
Scott-Moncrieff, who successfully put forward a motion for his
colleagues to boycott the opening ceremony.
Mr Scott-Moncrieff and fellow councillor Andrew Millar said they
planned to drive through the toll plaza without paying.
They are prepared to go to court over their protest. The councillors
also called on supporters to drive through with them or buy a badge
supporting their action for a cost of #10 to contribute towards their
legal defence costs.
Mr Scott-Moncrieff said yesterday: ''Councillor Millar and I feel
justified in resisting payment. The people of Skye nor their
representatives were consulted about a toll bridge.
''We feel the Government is morally bound to provide access to
bridgeable islands free of charge. We consider that passing an Act,
which protects this civil operation with the force of criminal law, is
an unwelcome development in social control and is a breach of the spirit
of the Treaty of Union.
''By refusing to pay, we hope that this question may be more publicly
scrutinised in a court of law.
''We regret being forced into this position. However, to this end, we
seek the help of at least 100 people who will pass the tolls without
offering payment and who will contest the resultant legal proceedings.''
The group met in the Tongadale Hotel on Skye and issued details of its
plan.
A Northern Constabulary spokesman said yesterday: ''It will amount to
fraud if they go through without paying. There will certainly be a
police presence during the opening, and if they go through with their
intention we would respond to any complaint forthcoming from the
bridge's operators.''
A spokeswoman for the Skye Bridge Company said: ''Apart from
pedestrians and cyclists, only emergency vehicles, disabled drivers and
people travelling for hospital treatment are exempt. There is no way any
other person could get across without paying.''
The opening ceremony will be boycotted by Skye and Lochalsh District
Council. But although the local authority has snubbed the Scottish
Secretary's invitation to attend the event, it has emerged councillors
and chief executive David Noble will meet Mr Forsyth before he cuts the
tape.
The council will be presented with the Investors In People (IIP)
award, a national standard in staff skills development. However, it has
declined to accept the plaque as part of the bridge opening ceremony.
Instead, it insisted the award be handed over beforehand.
The run-up to the opening has been dogged by controversy and claims
that the bridge is unsafe.
Structural experts rushed to its defence after it was revealed there
were cracks in the 600-yard concrete bridge.
It was also claimed that there were unexploded blasting charges still
in place on the bridge.
Council convener John Farquhar Munro called for an independent
investigation to reassure the public.
But the Miller Group, which built the bridge, and structural engineers
with the Scottish Office's consultants, JMP, who have monitored its
construction with Highland Regional Council officials, all insisted that
the bridge was safe.
They said they were aware of the cracks soon after the concrete was
poured, and insist it is common for these shrinkage cracks to appear.
However, the row over the bridge's charges -- the highest in Europe --
continues. Several MPs, including local Liberal Democrat MP Charles
Kennedy are also boycotting the opening in protest.
For at least the next 17 years, it will cost cars and small vans
#5.20p to cross the bridge each way in the summer, 20p cheaper than the
ferry, although discounts are being offered for 10 tickets which reduces
the price to #2.44p. In the winter, a single crossing will be #4.30 with
the same discounted price.
Pedestrians travel free, but if they do not feel like walking they can
cross by subsidised local shuttle buses, costing 10p. Previously, people
travelled free of charge on the ferry.

ARMED British police were on standby at the entrance to the Channel
Tunnel last night to support French colleagues who stepped up security
checks on vehicles and passengers.
However, Kent police emphasised that there was no specific threat to
the tunnel or passengers and that tightened security was ''not an
unusual occurrence''.
Assistant Chief Constable Bob Ayling, in charge of tunnel security,
said the move was prompted by ''the situation in France'' but would not
discuss any specific warnings received by the French.
Speculation had centred on possible threats from Muslim extremists
linked to the civil war in Algeria, who have been blamed for seven bomb
attacks in Paris and the Lyon region since July which have killed seven
and wounded more than 140.
Mr Ayling would say only: ''The information the French have is known
to Kent police but I am not at liberty to discuss that. I can say there
is no specific threat to the Channel Tunnel or the travelling public.''
French authorities are particularly keen to check people boarding at
Folkestone, because at the other end vehicles can be driven straight off
on to French roads with no further formalities.
In France, a newspaper claimed Algeria's most radical armed group
threatened more bombings, with a map depicting an exploding Eiffel
Tower.
The weekly Journal de Dimanche quoted the head of France's police
union, Jean-Louis Arajol, as saying he had received information
indicating that new terrorist attacks were being planned against targets
that included the Eiffel Tower, the Place de la Concorde, and the
capital's major department stores.

Frankfurt
A FRAIL 73-year-old woman gave German President Roman Herzog a tough
time when he presented her with the German Peace Prize today.
Professor Annemarie Schimmel, an expert on Muslim poetry, received the
award which traditionally marks the end of the Frankfurt Book Fair for
her life-long achievements in bridging the gap between European and
Islamic thinking.
Critics, however, say Schimmel's bridge is a one-way street,
detrimental to human rights issues and open to pro-Muslim appeasement.
Although no-one disputes her academic reputation, emotions were
running high yesterday that someone who had publicly expressed sympathy
for the death threat against Salman Rushdie could be awarded the
internationally prestigious prize.
One critic said that while Schimmel was no fundamentalist herself, her
position towards the fatwa remained ambiguous until she renounced it
during the debate which followed the April announcement that she was to
receive the prize.
Since then Schimmel has promoted understanding of the public outcry in
the Muslim world which followed publication of The Satanic Verses,
saying that she had seen grown men cry like children because of the
book.
The German Publishers' Association, sponsors of the peace prize which
has been awarded to the likes of Albert Schweitzer, the Club of Rome, or
Czech president Vaclav Havel, defend Schimmel as a victim of general
hatred against Muslim philosophy. ''Islam-bashing these days has become
a kind of sport in Europe,'' said spokesman Eugen Emmerling.
However Schimmel's critics, who include philosopher Jurgen Habermas,
British writer Fay Weldon, and Bangladeshi campaigner Taslima Nasrin,
say Schimmel has failed to use her excellent relations with Muslim
leaders to champion the cause of human rights.
Schimmel has been a close friend of the late Pakistani dictator Zia
ul-Haq and was adviser to President Herzog on his recent trip to
Pakistan. She also enjoys good relations with the Iranian regime.
However she has repeatedly denied any political background to her
work. ''I like being with people who are interested in culture, with
whom I could discuss literature,'' she said. ''In most cases I did not
even know which party my hosts belonged to.''
At today's ceremony Schimmel said: ''I am working for human rights in
my own way, but this does not mean forgiveness for the mere sake of
harmony.''
President Herzog, who is also a close personal friend, called for more
dialogue between Europe and the Muslim world but added: ''True dialogue
means that nobody must fear being tortured, imprisoned, or killed
because of his view.'' He urged the Iranian regime to halt the fatwa
immediately.

Washington
AS Washington braces itself for an enormous influx of black
demonstrators tomorrow in the ''Million Man March'', organiser Louis
Farrakhan cancelled all appearances.
An aide said the 62-year-old Nation of Islam leader was suffering from
exhaustion on the eve of what is expected to be the largest gathering of
black people since Martin Luther King proclaimed his dream of racial
peace and integration at the Lincoln Memorial.
Some Americans fear this march may further exacerbate race relations
in the wake of the O J Simpson trial.
Mr Farrakhan says that the event is a day of atonement and
reconciliation, but whites, Jews, Roman Catholics, gays, and black women
are excluded.
It is not probable that there will be a million men on the Mall
tomorrow: that would be one-tenth of the black male population. However,
buses have been leaving Chicago, St Louis, New York, and points south in
the past 36 hours. Organisers expect 12,000 buses. City authorities
claim to know of 2000 or less.
The authorities do, however, expect about 150,000 people, which is an
enormous crowd. The only times the million mark has been passed here
were for Lyndon Johnson's 1965 inauguration and the bicentennial
celebrations in 1976. Dr King had an audience of around 200,000.
Mr Farrakhan, meanwhile, is in trouble again for calling Jews
''bloodsuckers'' in an interview on Friday. He meant merchants who open
shops in black neighbourhoods and, he said, export their profits instead
of ploughing them back into the community. He insisted that he did not
mean Jews only: the accusation applied to Chinese, Koreans, and Latinos
who did the same thing.
The explanation did nothing to improve the minister's standing among
doubters. The eight-million-strong Baptist Church, the largest black
organisation, has refused to endorse the march. The oldest black
political group, the National Association for the Advancement of
Coloured People, has also held aloof.
Jesse Jackson is the most prominent black American to speak at the
rally. He will be joined by the Mayor of Washington, Marion Barry, and
by some black Congressmen -- but by no means all of them.
Colin Powell, who is still considering whether to run for president,
has declined an invitation to attend, and so has Johnnie Cochran, who
got O J Simpson off. Mr Simpson himself will probably also skip the
event.

Al-Ain
THE parents of condemned Filipina maid Sarah Balabagan today thanked
the family of the man she killed for sparing their daughter from
execution.
Sarah's mother Bai, 43, speaking through tears at the house in the
United Arab Emirates where her daughter stabbed Almas Muhammad
al-Baloushi to death last year, said: ''We want to convey our sincerest
gratitude to the family. We will never forget in our whole life what you
have done.''
Sarah's father, 47-year-old lumber yard labourer Karim, told the dead
man's eldest son, Faraj: ''I want to convey to you that we are grateful
for your decision. We are looking forward to the day when Sarah can join
us. Only Sarah can help us in the future.''
The Baloushi family yesterday dropped their demand that Balabagan be
executed and instead forgave her. In accordance with Islamic law, they
accepted diyah, or blood money, worth #27,300.
The maid had been condemned to death for premeditated murder after the
Islamic court in the oasis town of Al Ain rejected an earlier
manslaughter verdict.
It also turned down her plea that she stabbed 70-year-old Baloushi 34
times in self-defence during a rape.
The sentence provoked outrage in the Philippines, where many people
remembered the fate of Flor Contemplacion, a Filipina maid hanged in
Singapore for a double murder earlier this year. Many Filipinos
considered her innocent.
UAE authorities were stung by the reaction to the Balabagan verdict
and the President, Sheikh Zaid Bin Sultan al-Nahayan, intervened
personally to persuade the Baloushi family to forgive and accept blood
money.
Under Islamic law, the family of a murder victim can accept
compensation instead of the execution of the culprit.
At today's meeting in the Baloushi home, where 16-year-old Sarah
worked as housemaid, her mother presented Faraj with a gift of
chocolate. The families drank tea together.
Rony Paragas, a Filipino community leader, told the Baloushi brothers:
''The whole Filipino community thanks you. We're happy with your
decision and we're looking forward to friendly relations with you.''
Faraj replied: ''Inshallah (God willing). We are Muslims and we are
brothers.''
As the Balabagan family left after the half-hour meeting, Faraj said:
''I feel happy. They came here and talked to us. It makes me forget the
past.''
His younger brother Obeid said: ''I would have insisted on the death
sentence, but things happened and we can't dwell on them.''--Reuter.

Brussels
THE UK's senior European commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, could land
the Brussels job he coveted but was denied if an executive reshuffle is
carried out in the wake of the scandal threatening Nato secretary
general Willy Claes.
Mr Claes is considering standing down and the front runner for his
job, according to speculation last night, is Hans van den Broek, the
Dutch commissioner whose powerful portfolio involves planning for EU
expansion eastwards to take in the former Soviet satellite states.
Mr van den Broek's job is seen as the most important in the commission
after the president's, and was eagerly sought by Sir Leon when Mr
Jacques Santer replaced Jacques Delors. However, in what was seen as a
humiliating setback, Sir Leon was rebuffed by Mr Santer who left him
with responsibility only for trade.
Sir Leon is a committed European given to speaking up for the EU when
it is under attack from sceptics in his own party. He defended it again
last week after the onslaught from Michael Portillo, the
anti-integrationist Defence Minister.
Sir Leon's advance in the commission would be seen as strengthening
Britain's voice in Brussels ahead of next year's Maastricht review
super-summit.
However everything depends on Mr Claes, whose fate should be known
later this week when the Belgian Parliament decides whether to back a
special commission which recommended he should lose his immunity and be
prosecuted.
Other leading European politicians being touted to succeed Mr Claes if
he resigns include Danish Opposition leader and former foreign minister
Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, the
outgoing Portuguese Prime Minister, Anibal Cavaco Silva, and Norway's
Thorvald Stoltenberg, formerly a peace negotiator in Bosnia.
Douglas Hurd, the recently retired British Foreign Secretary, is also
being talked of and would be popular with many of his former colleagues.
He was among the more cautious but respected politicians handling the
Bosnian crisis which is the biggest challenge facing Nato as the peace
process begins to take effect.
Mr Claes was Belgium's Finance Minister when his party was plunged
into scandal after receiving alleged bribes from Italian and French
helicopter manufacturers in return for orders. He has always insisted he
was completely innocent.
Mr Claes spent the weekend consulting the Nato partners who have so
far stood by him in public, although some have said privately he should
go. He is expected to announce today whether he will defend himself
before the Belgian Parliament in a final attempt to sway MPs and stave
off an indictment.
Mr Claes is a popular and respected figure in Belgium where his fate
could yet rest on a political deal between his own fellow socialists and
their coalition partners, the Christian Democrats.
A joint vote in his favour would be enough to block further
proceedings against him.
Mr Claes told a television reporter: ''I'm very sad, very disappointed
because I'm convinced that for some 30 years I served the country as I
ought to have and I don't deserve this fate.''

Baghdad
MILLIONS of Iraqis voted ''Yes'' for Saddam Hussein as president today
in a referendum expected to show unanimous support for the Iraqi leader.
Saddam Hussein is sole candidate in the vote on whether he should stay
on as Iraqi president. He was expected to address a message of thanks to
the Iraqi people as soon as the overall result was ready.
The ruling Revolutionary Command Council said he had won 99.95% of the
first million or so votes counted, with 52 ''No'' votes and 474 spoiled
papers.
The government has predicted that the 7.5 million voters will return
Saddam with 100% support.
In the capital Baghdad election organisers prepared to celebrate a
victory for Saddam, setting up marquees and installing light displays on
traffic roundabouts. Brass bands and dancing girls were standing by for
the result.
Some residents said they were cleaning their Kalashnikov rifles ready
to fire in the air, a traditional Iraqi form of celebration. ''It will
be a night the like of which Baghdad has never seen,'' said one
official.
At many polling stations, the flood of voters ticked the ''Yes'' boxes
on the ballot papers right on the registration table and then put them
in the ballot boxes unfolded.
In one north-east Baghdad slum the organisers did not point out the
polling booths on the other side of the courtyard. Where they did, many
voters ignored them.
''They're free to do their voting where they like and anyway no-one
here hates Saddam Hussein,'' said a Justice Ministry official. Election
officers, to help those confused by the unfamiliar process, pointed to
the ''Yes'' box.
Baghdad hopes the referendum will repair the damage done when Saddam's
sons-in-law defected in August and will help to counter the argument
that he is weakened by UN sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990.
''It will reinforce the solidarity between the great Iraqi people and
the militant leader, Saddam Hussein,'' said Abdul-Jawad Dhanoun, deputy
chairman of Saddam's office. ''It will show that the Leader is Iraq and
Iraq is the Leader.''
Salah al-Mukhtar, editor of the government newspaper al-Jumhouria,
said: ''When they went to vote, they saw two choices -- Saddam Hussein
and the survival of Iraq, or accepting the US option and the
fragmentation of Iraq.
''The Iraqi people don't want anyone to explain to them what to
choose. They have suffered genocide.''
The media, all government-owned, have carried no hint of opposition or
of arguments against Saddam continuing in office.
In public statements at the polling stations, voters invariably said
they would vote for Saddam, who has ruled the country without a direct
popular mandate since 1979.
In private many Iraqis said the exercise was futile and they voted
only in fear that abstaining might be risky.
Information Minister Hamed Youssef Hummadi told reporters yesterday
that the referendum was part of a gradual transition towards more
representative government.
The next steps would be disbanding the Revolutionary Command Council,
the highest authority since the Baath Party coup of 1968, and setting up
a second chamber of Parliament, with 25 elected members and 25
appointed.
The authorities would also loosen their tight control on political
parties and the press, he added.
Similar ideas have surfaced in the past, after the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq
war and the Gulf War over Kuwait for example, without any obvious change
in the political system.
Ultra-nationalist Russian leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who spent five
hours with Saddam last night, told reporters that he thought the Iraqi
leader wanted political change.
''Saddam said he would like to develop democracy because Iraq can't be
an island in the middle of a large world.
''But when he has no referendum the Americans say he has no democracy,
and when he does have a referendum the Americans say he has no
democracy. He says 'What can I do?' ''
Zhirinovsky, the first man in months to speak in public about Saddam's
state of mind, said he found him mellowed.
''He was in a good mood, much more relaxed than I have seen him
before, and less confrontational and aggressive
. . . There's no negative feeling about the United States
. . . He has no feeling of revenge,'' he said.--Reuter.

Marjayoun, Lebanon
HIZBOLLAH guerrillas, stepping up attacks as Israel's peace talks with
Lebanon and Syria languish, killed six Israeli soldiers today in their
deadliest assault this year.
In the second fatal bombing in south Lebanon in four days, a roadside
bomb destroyed an Israeli armoured personnel carrier packed with troops,
setting it ablaze and killing six men and seriously wounding two.
Last Thursday a similar blast killed three Israeli soldiers and
wounded six.
Hours after today's attack in the eastern sector of Israel's south
Lebanon occupation area, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin visited
the border buffer zone.
Rabin, who later called an emergency Cabinet meeting in Israel, met
senior Israeli army officers in Marjayoun.
The Israeli army said the two attacks brought the number of Israeli
soldiers killed in Lebanon this year to 22, more than in all of last
year.
A grim Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres pointed a finger of
accusation at Syria.
''The escalation in Lebanon is very dangerous to all sides
. . . I want to address the question: who can prevent this flare-up?
There is no doubt that Syria must participate in preventing this
flare-up, the Lebanese Government must participate,'' Peres told Israel
Radio.
Israeli leaders regularly call on Damascus, the main power broker in
Lebanon, to stop guerrilla attacks.
Peres was speaking after talks with PLO head Yasser Arafat in Gaza on
implementing last month's accord to extend Palestinian self-rule in the
West Bank.
However signs abound that Israel-Syria talks are in serious trouble
and comprehensive Middle East peace still far off.
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher has announced that he will
not visit Israel and Syria when he attends an economic summit in Amman
this month, the latest sign that the peace talks are frozen.
And today's raised concern about Israeli reprisals and an increase in
fighting in south Lebanon, the last active Arab-Israeli frontline.
In Beirut, Sheikh Na'eem Qassem, deputy chief of the pro-Iranian
Hizbollah fighting Israelis in south Lebanon, said retaliatory Israeli
shelling on civilian areas in Lebanon ''will be met by a fierce response
on northern Palestine''.
Hizbollah chief Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah urged his fighters to be ''at
utmost readiness to face all possibilities on all front lines in the
Western Bekaa and South Lebanon''.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Protest to Forsyth on trusts' #10.8m</HEADLINE>

LABOUR MP Brian Donohoe said today that directors of NHS trusts in
Scotland were being paid a total of nearly #11m and called for action
from Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.
Giving the results of a survey of the 1994/95 annual reports of the 39
NHS trusts operating in Scotland before April this year, Mr Donohoe said
the directors of the 34 Scottish trusts who responded had received
#10.8m in total in 1994/95, compared with #4.7m for the 16 trusts
existing in 1993/94.
He added that the remuneration of the directors of the trusts had
topped #10m for the first time in the NHS in Scotland and said that this
''speaks volumes about the costs incurred by the NHS in Scotland as a
result of their obsession with trust status.''
Trust status, he said, had started to bring the pay and perks excesses
of the privatised utilities to the NHS, and the Scottish Office should
step in before it got any worse.
The survey revealed, he said, that in a great many trusts, the call
for pay restraint had fallen on deaf ears among trust senior management.
''Whilst awarding their nursing and ancillary staff increases in salary
of 3%, some trust chief executives and trust boards have been happy to
award themselves well above this.
''The fact that the Secretary of State for Scotland is now seeking to
restrict the pay and perks of NHS senior management is welcome but it
looks like too little too late.''
Mr Donohue said Mr Forsyth appeared to have forgotten that a new pay
structure of NHS management was implemented just over two years ago by
the Scottish Office. These figures showed that the Scottish Office's
guidance clearly had not worked.
The survey showed that the trust whose members received the highest
level of remuneration in 1994/95 was the board of Grampian Healthcare
which received #419,000, an increase of 17.5% on the #356,000 of the
previous year. The highest-paid chief executive was Grampian
Healthcare's Jeremy Taylor, whose remuneration increased to #101,000 in
1994/95.
The chief executives of the 34 trusts received a total of #2,297,000
in remuneration, an increase from the previous financial year of
#1,008,000, when there were only 16 NHS trusts operating.
A Scottish Office spokesman said later that Mr Forsyth had taken
urgent action last week to curb administration costs in the NHS and had
said he wanted #14m cut off costs.
Mr Forsyth had called on senior managers to ''lead by example''.
The spokesman said Mr Geoffrey Scaife, chief executive of the NHS in
Scotland, had written to trust chairmen, asking them to ensure that any
further increases in pay for senior management could be fully supported
in public and to make sure the maximum possible of NHS funds were put
into patient care.

EVERYONE has them, but most get to keep them hidden. When you are in
line to be a White House candidate, however, the skeletons are bound to
tumble from the cupboard.
That august British tome of reference, Burke's Peerage, today reveals
General Colin Powell -- soldier, diplomat, author, and seen by many
Americans as their next President -- possesses a distinctly chequered
genetic past.
On the plus side, the man who could become the first black US
President is well connected with royalty, numbering the Queen, the Queen
Mother and the Princess of Wales among his distant cousins.
In the debit column, there lurks a prominent British soldier, Sir Eyre
Coote, who was eventually dismissed from his regiment in 1815 for
''sexual improprieties'' involving choirboys.
Before that, Sir Eyre fathered a child with a black slave girl in
Jamaica. That child became the general's great-great-great-grandmother.
The dichotomy is well summed up by the publishing director of Burke's,
Mr Harold Brookes-Baker. ''On both sides of the Atlantic, prevailing
trends in Colin Powell's family tree have included illegitimacy, as well
as economical and political success.''
The general's ancestry includes Scottish, English, Irish, Jewish and
American-Indian (Arawak, to be precise) blood.
His inheritance from Scotland apparently stems from a grandparent, a
McKoy, who was half Scottish and half native Jamaican.
Officially described as ''a distinguished line of Irish military
baronets'', the Coote's branches encompass Sir Eyre, the chap with the
dubious lifestyle, but also the individual through whom the general is
related to most of the great ancient families of Britain, France, Italy,
Germany and Spain.
Sir Eyre (1762-1823) carried the British colours at the Battle of
Brooklyn in 1776, and also served in campaigns at York Island,
Chesapeake, and New York. He was imprisoned at Yorktown, but was sent to
the West Indies in 1793 and distinguished himself, being appointed
brigadier-general three years later.
After more military gallantry, this time in Ireland and Egypt, where
his service was rewarded by being made a Knight of Bath, he was
appointed lieutenant-governor and commander-in-chief of Jamaica.
However, he resigned his government in 1808, soon after the slave
girl, Sally, bore his child. In 1814, he was made up to the rank of
general, but later let the side down again, this time with the
choirboys. His dismissal also meant he became the first man permanently
to lose the Order of the Bath.
On the military side, it is easy to see why General Powell plumped for
an army career. His genetic predilections were shaped by William the
Conqueror, and England's warrior king, Edward I.
Mr Brookes-Baker's staff has researched the genealogy of every
President since Washington, and he is no doubt of its importance. ''This
is an example of the royalty and leadership gene in action. In every
American presidential election since the time of Washington, the victor
has always been the candidate who has had the greatest number of ties to
the royal blood.''
Successful candidates from this theory have included Ulysses Grant,
the Roosevelts, and Ronald Reagan. General Powell can also claim kinship
with Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and George Bush.

EDUCATION Secretary Gillian Shephard and her Labour counterpart David
Blunkett were involved in an angry exchange yesterday over the future of
Britain's schools.
Mrs Shephard defended the Government's plan -- announced at the
Conservative Party conference last week -- to extend the assisted places
scheme which pays for some children to attend private schools.
But Shadow Education Secretary David Blunkett attacked the scheme as a
''nonsense'' and promised a Labour Government would phase it out and use
the cash to improve standards for all pupils.
They also argued about grant-maintained schools which the Prime
Minister wants to see extended, while Labour wants to reform them
radically and replace them with foundation schools.
Education now has shot to the top of the political agenda with deep
differences emerging between Labour and the Tories over how the matter
should be handled.
Mrs Shephard and Mr Blunkett resorted to bitter language when they
appeared on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost programme in a clear sign that
education will be a key battleground at the next General Election.
Mrs Shephard accused Labour of ''U-turns on standards'', while Mr
Blunkett attacked her for ''complacency and carping''.
Turning her fire on Labour, Mrs Shephard warned Mr Blunkett to keep
his hands off grant-maintained schools.
''My message would be in this period to the Labour Party 'Don't mess
with grant-maintained parents. They are a powerful force','' she said.
However, Mr Blunkett said the Government would not have time to carry
out its plans to extend assisted places in full before the next
election. He accused Ministers of taking #220m out of the system to
offer an ''escape route'' for a selected few.

<HEADLINE>Warning of funding crisis as Glasgow stage company celebrates its 50th anniversary. Citizens' Theatre faces closure</HEADLINE>

THE Citizens' Theatre in Glasgow will be forced to close to the public
for anything between four and six months of next year if alternative
sources of funding are not found to replace its grant from Strathclyde
Regional Council.
The internationally renowned company received #178,000 from the
regional authority this year. Strathclyde will cease to exist at the end
of March, when Scotland's new single-tier local government structure
comes into operation.
Speaking on Friday night at a celebration of the Citizens' Theatre's
50 years at its Gorbals home, artistic director Giles Havergal said:
''The level of services we provide will be drastically reduced unless
that funding is replaced.''
Mr Havergal told invited guests, including local councillors and
representatives of the Scottish Arts Council, that the company staged
429 performances in 1994 to audiences that averaged 74% of the capacity
of the house. In his 25 years running the Citizens', the theatre had
never incurred a deficit.
Suggesting that responsibility for funding the theatre went beyond the
new Glasgow City Council, Mr Havergal noted that a party of
schoolchildren from Carlisle were that night attending the studio
theatre production of Noel Coward's A Song At Twilight.
A theatre spokesperson confirmed the latest four-year plan submitted
to the Arts Council assumed that the theatre was to close to the public
between May and September. An earlier date of March is also said to have
been considered.
Unlike Scottish Opera's plan to put the entire company on a part-time
footing, core staff would still be employed at the Citizens' all year
round.
The guests at the 50th birthday party attended a performance of Sean
O'Casey's The Shadow Of A Gunman, directed by Jon Pope, before a toast
to the theatre was proposed by Lord Provost Tommy Dingwall.
He described the occasion as ''the golden anniversary of one of the
city's greatest attractions whose touring abroad took the name of the
city to many who had never heard of it''.
Citizens' Theatre chairman Professor Jan MacDonald, of Glasgow
University's theatre studies department, said the company was ''coyly
admitting to being 50 when it was in fact 52 and a bit''.
The anniversary was of the company, which was founded by playwright
James Bridie, moving to the Royal Princess's Theatre, built in 1879 as
part of a scheme to make the Gorbals a shopping and residential centre
and the first theatre in Europe to be financed by public subscription.
Guests, who included Bridie's son, Bingo Mavor, and actor and former
Citizens' director Iain Cuthbertson, were given a facsimile of the
programme for the first production by the new company, J B Priestley's
Johnson Over Jordan, which starred Joan Mathieson and Margery Manning.
It marked the beginning of a 10-year lease on the building by the
Citizens' company in what was described ''one of the handsomest houses
in the kingdom''.

THE Girl Guide movement is facing a crisis because women cannot spare
the time to be Brown Owls or Guide leaders.
The Guide Association said ''lots'' of girls were on waiting lists to
join groups, but were being turned away because there is no-one to lead
them.
National membership of the movement has fallen from 814,000 to 750,000
over the last 12 years.
''One of the problems is social change,'' said Guide Association
spokeswoman Jackie Bennett.
''Many young women have to juggle family and their career -- that
leaves little time for voluntary activities.''
She added: ''We are constantly on the look out for new leaders. We
find that the demand from girls far exceeds the number of leaders we
have.
''If we had a lot more we could provide a lot more youth education.''
But she said the association did not like advertising for new leaders
for fear of attracting the wrong type of person.
''Advertising, we find from practical experience, is not particularly
beneficial.
''The most effective way of recruiting is by personal referral and
contacts. It is a youth organisation, it is a very responsible position,
so you have to be very careful who you take.''
One Guide leader said: ''We rely on the goodwill of one or two
individuals who struggle from year to year. You kind of rock from one
crisis to another.''

A GAMEKEEPER, sacked from a top Scottish shooting estate, claimed
yesterday that increasing numbers of ''Hooray Henry'' sportsmen were
driving him out of the job.
Mr Paul Washington said he had become disillusioned by the ''arrogant
and toffee-nosed'' attitude of clients, mostly from England, who came to
the Scottish hills to shoot deer and grouse.
Mr Washington, 35, said his feelings were reinforced three weeks ago
when he accompanied a senior member of the Cabinet on a shoot on Royal
Deeside.
''The man ignored me all day,'' Mr Washington said.
''He is typical of the Hooray Henry, yah-yah types that come to the
hills and treat gamekeepers and stalkers as though we were some low form
of working class.
''Unfortunately, the people that are in charge of a lot of the estates
nowadays are also that way inclined. It leaves a nasty taste in the
mouth,'' he said.
Mr Washington was sacked last month by the management of Invercauld
Estate, which is separated from the Queen's Balmoral Estate by the River
Dee.
He was dismissed shortly before the broadcast of a Channel 4
documentary, The Firing Range, in which he and other estate staff
criticised the way the estate was being run.
He lodged a claim for unfair dismissal which was due to be heard today
at an industrial tribunal hearing in Aberdeen.
On Friday afternoon, the estate said they were not going to contest
his claim and he won an out-of-court settlement of #6500.
Mr Washington, a bachelor, has been told to leave his tied cottage on
the estate by the end of October and has so far been unable to find a
new home for himself and his two Border terriers, Willie and Midge.
He said yesterday that he believed a way of life was disappearing in
the Scottish Highlands.
Invercauld Estate is owned by Captain Alwyn Farquharson, who has now
retired and lives in another property on Mull.
He handed over the running of Invercauld to a trust and the day-to-day
running of the estate is in the hands of the new factor, Mr Simon
Blackett, whose management style was criticised heavily in the Channel 4
programme.

FOUR men are contesting the election to lead Britain's largest trade
union, Unison, which has around 1.3 million members, almost one million
of them women.
It was widely assumed that only a strong woman candidate could have
posed any threat to the odds-on favourite, associate general secretary
Rodney Bickerstaffe.
He now should have little problem in seeing off his challengers, one
from the far right and two from the hard left, for the #64,000-a-year
post, one of the most influential in the union movement.
The only slight uncertainty stems from the fact that Unison is still
bedding down from the 1993 amalgamation of the former Nalgo, Nupe, and
Cohse unions which created it.
Balloting is under way with the result due early next month when it
will be declared who is to succeed former Nalgo general secretary, Mr
Alan Jinkinson. He is due to step down next February.
Mr Bickerstaffe, 50, was previously general secretary of Nupe. He
became associate general secretary of Unison on the amalgamation.
His list of nominations include the union national executive, six
service groups, and 283 branches.
Newcastle male nurse Yunus Bakhsh, a Trotskyist, received 47 branch
nominations; Mr Roger Bannister, local government officer, Unison
executive member, Liverpool branch secretary, and Militant supporter,
attracted 42; and transport official and right-wing member of the
executive, Mr Peter Hunter from Lytham St Annes, gained 29 nominations.
Meanwhile, Unison's 860,000 local government members have turned away
from any industrial action in support of a #5-a-week interim top-up pay
claim, preferring to hold fire until the 1996 negotiations which open in
December.
More than half of the workers concerned are on basic pay rates of
below the #4.15 an hour target which many people maintain would be
triggered by the TUC policy of ''half male median earnings''.
Branches have been asked to submit their views on whether the union
should press for a minimum rate, if so at what level, and whether it
should be a target for this year or over several.
Advice on the actual size of the demand and whether it should be for a
flat rate amount, a percentage or combination of the two is also being
sought.

PARISHIONERS in the Argyll village of Tighnabruaich claim little is
being done about their complaints over the closure of the local church
and what they claim are the ''intolerable actions'' of the minister.
The alleged lack of action by Church of Scotland officials has led to
the average attendance at services dropping from 230 to around 35,
parishioners claim.
Since his appointment as minister at Tighnabruaich more than six years
ago, the Rev Iain Barclay, 48, has been accused by parishioners of,
among other things, being the architect of the closure of Tighnabruaich
church and the village hall.
Details of all the complaints against Mr Barclay have been submitted
to Dunoon Presbytery by members of the congregation.
In 1992, villagers complained when the presbytery agreed to the
closure of their church, forcing the congregation to use the parish
church in the nearby village of Kames.
A petition was raised but the Synod of Argyll overturned the
presbytery's decision to reopen the church, ignoring the demands of the
local congregation, which claimed it was misled by Mr Barclay.
He had argued that the church roof was in a dangerous state and would
be too costly to repair, recommending closure to the board, they allege,
without consulting the congregation or giving them the opportunity to
raise funds.
A chaplain to the forces with the 1st Battalion Royal Scots at the
British Military Hospital in Munster, Germany, between 1976 and 1979, Mr
Barclay's military service continued during the Gulf war.
Members of the Tighnabruaich congregation say they have been
complaining about him to Dunoon Presbytery since 1990 but that officials
have failed to act.
Miss Thelma Lushington, who has corresponded with the presbytery on
the matter for five years, said: ''Many of us here are most concerned
over what has happened and it appears that nobody in authority intends
to do anything about it.
''There are old people who went to the Tighnabruaich church who have
no means of getting to Kames for Sunday worship. They sit alone day
after day with no member of the Kirk coming near.''
Local residents claim that a petition over the church closure was sent
to the presbytery. The village church hall has also been closed and
groups such as the Women's Rural Institute and the RNLI have to meet in
a private house.
''This minister's decision has reduced a thriving two-church
congregation into a single church with less than half the parishioners
and a negative bank balance. What has taken place here is a travesty,''
Miss Lushington, the former church organist, added.
Mr Barclay refused to comment, saying: ''I am an employee of the
Church of Scotland and all comments on church matters, whatever they
are, have to come from the Church of Scotland in Edinburgh.''
Church officials in Edinburgh were unable to answer specific
allegations made against the Dunoon Presbytery or Mr Barclay but a
spokesman said: ''If anyone has information about what they believe to
be improper behaviour by a minister, the correct course would be to
submit this to the minister's presbytery so that appropriate action may
be taken. No such submission has been made, as far as we can
establish.''
He said that no-one from Dunoon Presbytery could be contacted because
of holidays in the area.

MEMBERS of a Scottish Parliament could be entitled to chair meetings
of the EU's Council of Ministers, according to a leading Euro MP.
Mr David Martin, Lothians Labour MEP, will tell a conference in
Edinburgh today the UK supported a clause in the Maastricht Treaty to
allow representatives of governments below member state level into the
council if they had the power to sign agreements on behalf of their
governments.
Mr Martin, vice-president of the European Parliament, will tell the
delegates at the ''Local Europe 96'' conference that when Germany holds
the presidency of the European Council, the meetings are chaired by an
education minister from one of the state parliaments (or Lander) as this
function is a wholly-devolved one within Germany.
He will also call for more powers to be given to the EU's committee of
the regions, which has five Scottish members, all councillors.
Devolution and increased power for local government under Labour is in
the mainstream of European development, he argues, and will provide a
tremendous boost for Scotland's economy and for regional economies
throughout Britain.

DEFENCE Secretary Michael Portillo yesterday produced a strong
justification for his speech to the Tory conference last week, which was
widely seen as anti-European.
He said: ''Je ne regrette rien (I regret nothing)'' when challenged
about criticism of the tone of his speech, which has provoked attacks
from the pro-European Tory Left and the European Commission President
Jacques Santer.
Tory MPs in the 90-strong Positive European Group are to meet Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind tomorrow to protest at Mr Portillo's
''intemperate language'', while 49 MPs who have formed the Macleod
Society (named after the former Tory Chancellor) are requesting a
meeting with the Prime Minister in a bid to put a block on Mr Portillo
making such remarks again.
Mr Portillo last week moved far from his conference brief with an
attack on moves to greater European integration and strong criticism on
centralisation of power in Brussels.
Yesterday, he said: ''I stripped away all the waffle and fudge and any
Euro-speak and I said very plainly that a Conservative Government is not
going to allow Britain to be drawn into a European superstate, where
very important decisions about our daily lives will be taken by a
majority vote of ministers in the Council of Ministers, or perhaps even
by the Commission.''
The Defence Secretary insisted, in an interview for BBC's On the
Record programme, that both he and the Prime Minister were singing from
the same hymn sheet, though he agreed that his delivery was louder.
What was clear, Mr Portillo claimed, was that the majority of British
people were happy with the development of the Single European Market,
and were happy to fight alongside European allies, as in Bosnia. They
did not, however, wish to see political control lost from Parliament and
the British Government.
''Let me make it clear again that I am delighted to work towards
European defence co-operation and delighted with the allies we have in
Europe, who have been very brave allies indeed,'' he said.
''What I am not prepared to do ultimately is move towards what is
hinted at in the Maastricht Treaty, which is to move towards common
defence.''
Mr Portillo's conference speech, however, still attracted heavy
criticism. EC President Jacques Santer insisted there would be a
European single currency by 1999, stressed there must be closer union
between European member states, and emphasised the importance of a
common foreign and security policy.
Asked in an LWT interview to give his reaction to Mr Portillo's views,
he said: ''On British territory, I would not repeat it.''
Pressed further, he said he agreed with his officials, who had been
quoted as describing it as ''grotesque and deplorable''. He said of Mr
Portillo's views: ''I must say that my Tory friends in the European
Parliament and elsewhere were not very happy about this.''
The Tory Positive European Group accused Mr Portillo of making ''an
intemperate and unwise speech''. Mr Hugh Dykes, pro-European MP for
Harrow East, said: ''Like others, I was appalled at his antics and the
way he was trying to fan the worst kind of emotions and quite
disgraceful attacks on Europe which, by the way, will also do us serious
harm with the election approaching.''

THE 17-year-old surgeon's son who took Glasgow University to court,
claiming it had treated him unfairly by refusing his application to
study medicine, has abandoned his dream of being a doctor.
Conor O'Reilly has matriculated at the same university to study
general science.
He said earlier this summer he planned to take a year out and assist
in medical research before reapplying to study medicine at any of
Scotland's medical faculties, but preferably at Glasgow.
However, the teenager, of Newlands Road, Glasgow, said yesterday he
was studying maths, computing science, and biology at Glasgow
University's science faculty and that he was no longer considering
medicine as an option.
He said he thought the admissions procedure ''has put me off''.
He added: ''I decided that I didn't really want to take a year out --
I thought it would be a bit of a waste of time. Doing maths has always
been a possibility.''
In August, the Court of Session heard that the university had rejected
his application, despite his academic qualifications of six A-pass
Highers.
The court rejected the youth's argument that the university had acted
unreasonably and in breach of the rules of natural justice by failing to
inform candidates they must have had work experience in a hospital,
surgery, or a caring environment.
The university's case was that while it regarded work experience as
desirable it was not an essential precondition.
Having already rejected the unconditional offers he received from
other Scottish universities, he was left without a place in any medical
faculty this year.

SCOTS are among the worst sufferers in the state poverty trap, a
leading Labour MP claimed yesterday.
Figures compiled by Mr Alan Milburn, MP for Darlington and a member of
the Public Accounts Committee, show that a disproportionately high
number of Scottish applicants have been refused emergency loans by the
Benefits Agency.
Over the last three years, almost 250,000 applications across the UK
have been rejected, of which more than 44,000, or 18%, came from
Scotland. The expected percentage, based on population statistics, would
be about 10%.
One reason often given for rejecting an application is that the
individual or family involved is too poor to repay the loan they need to
acquire essential items like a cooker or furniture, or pay removal
expenses.
Labour's Scottish social work spokeswoman, Mrs Maria Fyfe, said she
was not surprised at the high level of poverty in Scotland, given the
number of long-term unemployed.
''I regularly find people who are not helped by this heartless system
which has a limited budget. The people who need the financial assistance
are those who can't establish any savings to cope with life's crises.''
Mr Milburn said his figures, which were derived from questioning
Ministers and a former chief executive of the Benefits Agency, would
intensify concerns that planned Government cuts in social security would
force more people into deeper poverty.
He said: ''The Government has placed the poorest people in a
horrendous Catch-22 situation. The very people that the Social Fund was
designed to help now find that they are too poor to qualify.''
The fund was introduced under the 1986 Social Security Act, which was
pushed through Parliament by Mr John Major, then a junior Minister. It
replaced the old system by which claimants had a virtually automatic
right to payment if in desperate need.
Mr Milburn said: ''Far from targeting help to the most needy, Peter
Lilley's social security reforms have left the benefits safety net shot
through with holes.
''Even before Ministers again take the axe to social security
spending, thousands of vulnerable people are being left without a vital
lifeline.
''Instead of tax cuts for the better-off, the Government should be
taking concerted action to get people into work and out of benefit.''
Mr Milburn said he would be urging the Chancellor to adopt Labour's
proposal for a windfall tax on the privatised utilities to fund an
emergency job- creation programme aimed at the long-term unemployed.

A FOOTBALLER who was shot as he played in an amateur cup tie in the
Renfrewshire village of Uplawmoor at the weekend was said to be in a
''stable'' condition in hospital yesterday.
Mr Charles Ballantyne, 36, a father of three, from Motherwell,
underwent emergency surgery at Paisley's Royal Alexandra Hospital.
He was hit in the head as he played on Saturday for a pub team,
Hillhouse of Hamilton, against Barrhead YM at playing fields in Neilston
Road, Uplawmoor.
Mr Ballantyne, who works for British Telecom, has played for the
Hillhouse side for two years.
A team member said: ''It was terrifying. Once we realised what had
happened and that Charlie had been shot, some of us ran over and tried
to make him as comfortable as possible until the ambulance arrived. We
are still in shock.''
After the incident, in the second half of the match, armed police
surrounded a block of flats in Bank Street, Paisley, which was sealed
off.
A police spokesman confirmed yesterday that three men -- aged 28, 31
and 36 -- had been arrested and were being held in custody in connection
with the incident.
It is understood that the three will appear at Paisley Sheriff Court
today.

Mr Dingwall said he had no plans to withdraw the invitation in the

ALTHOUGH a revolution has taken place in the techniques which allow
brain surgeons to ''see'' inside an injured patient's head, the surgical
techniques themselves have remained largely the same for 50 years.
The objective is simple: to remove the blood clot building up round
the brain before pressure results in irreparable damage or death. If
this is successful, the patient's chances will be further enhanced by
modern intensive care techniques.
The next big advance could be in drugs, now under trial in Glasgow and
other centres, to reduce collateral damage resulting from
over-stimulation of the brain's biochemical system.
Mr Thomas Hide, clinical director of the Institute of Neurological
Sciences where Jim Murray was treated, said yesterday: ''Probably the
biggest change that has taken place has been the fact that you can
diagnose these injuries without invasive investigations.
''In the old days, we were going by clinical experience and expertise,
and by drilling into the head.
''We used to wait until the person deteriorated before we acted
because we had to know there was something wrong.''
One of Mr Hide's former colleagues, MP Sam Galbraith, tried to refine
the process with a risk-assessment scale, taking into account different
factors such as skull fractures or depressed consciousness, so surgeons
could predict more accurately when it was time to go in.
Since the 1970s, however, first the CT scan and then magnetic
resonance imaging transformed the information available to neurosurgeons
in advance, allowing them to operate before the symptoms were obvious,
and hence more advanced.
''The main neurosurgical treatment of operating and taking out blood
clots has not changed significantly,'' said Mr Hide.
''What has changed is, firstly, our ability to improve the patient's
state prior to operation and, secondly, to look after him afterwards.''
He said drugs were used to deal with swelling of the brain and new
ones were coming on the scene.
A blow to the head can lead to both contusion and bruising, which may
be associated with a blood clot.
Murray seems to have been the victim of a low-velocity shearing injury
which twisted the brain round on its axis, tearing the anchorages and
blood vessels which join it to the skull.
As the pressure grew from the clot and from the bruising within the
brain, it triumphed over the blood pressure's efforts to pump oxygen
into his brain.

IT was the weeping girls in the black bomber jackets that were the
most visible sign of a community plunged into mourning.
In Newmains, the news that local boxer Jim Murray had lost his most
precious fight stunned neighbours, friends, and, of course, his family.
As Jim's Uncle Ian said on the doorstep to the family home in Eastwood
Drive, Newmains, a ''gentleman'' had died. The girls were walking past
the house, tears streaming down their faces, angry and too distressed to
talk.
The family, too, were in no mood to talk of the son and brother who
fought so hard throughout Friday night's bantamweight bout at the
Hospitality Inn, only to be tragically felled by a blow from opponent
Drew Docherty.
All day, relatives and friends arrived to deliver their sympathy to
Murray's parents, Kenny and Margaret Murray, and their children.
Ian Murray, the brother of Jim's father Kenny, spoke to reporters.
He said: ''He was a bit of a hero to the local community and I'm not
saying that because I'm his uncle. He was a decent man, a gentleman, and
the family are devastated. The minister will be paying them a visit
later. The family will talk about Jim tomorrow.''
As churchgoers emerged from Sunday services and collected the papers,
the tragedy that spun on from Friday night peeked across the fold and
made shocking reading.
One deeply saddened reader was Mr David McKendrick, Newmain's district
councillor, who regularly played five-a-side football with the boxer
before Murray pulled out for fear an injury would ruin his rising
career.
He said of the 24-year-old who attended Wishaw High School: ''I
remember thinking when he quit football that he might drift into drink
and drugs as so many young lads do. But not Jim. He was 110% genuine. He
was up at 5.30 doing roadwork before going to his work.
''Many people are spoken well of after their death, Jim was spoken
well off while he was alive. This is a bleak, sad day for this
community. It is devastated. Friday the 13th will long be remembered
here.''
At the Cleland miner's welfare club, where Murray would regularly pop
in for a pint, the atmosphere was depressed, a mood tinged with anger
over Friday's riots. Around a table top of beers, lads the age of Murray
discussed his death.
''It's just tragic,'' said Mr John Reynolds. ''I saw him only last
Saturday night, wished him good luck with the fight.'' Mr Willie
Townsley said: ''He was a quiet guy who enjoyed his pint but he was
dedicated to his boxing.''
The portrait of the young man, who lived not for his work as a
landscape gardener with Motherwell District Council but to box, was
completed by Colin Wallace.
Mr Wallace, of neighbouring Newarthill, turned professional at the
same time as Murray and regularly trained with him.
''He was just so dedicated, he was a typical happy-go-lucky kind of
guy. Everybody got on well with him and he got on well with everybody.
Instead of drinking and stuff like that, boxing was his passion.''
Mr Wallace was unable to attend the fight because of work but watched
the television coverage in shock.
The village of Condorrat lies between Cumbernauld and Airdrie and
boasts the same small shops, and couple of bars that lie at the heart of
Newmains. From this community grew Drew Docherty, Britain's bantamweight
title holder. The weekend's events have stunned the little boxer and the
community.
A local boxing fan who did not wish to be named, but knows Docherty,
said: ''It will take him a long time to come back, if he does at all.
But you'll have to be careful what you say around here. Feelings are
running pretty high after the fight.''
In the Condorrat Welfare Club, where fight fans regularly gather to
sink a few and talk bouts, the management was adamant that the clientele
had nothing to say. ''No comment,'' said the club's manager as we were
shown the door.
Mr Mick Clinton, the brother of boxer Pat Clinton, trains boys at
Drew's old amateur club. He said: ''I know Drew, and he will be totally
shocked by James's death.
''Drew and James had fought years ago, when they were both amateurs,
and they were friends. Only Drew can decide whether he will fight again
but this accident shouldn't mean the end of boxing.''
The debate over the banning of boxing when it arose in conversation
was not as you might expect. No-one demanded its prohibition. Instead,
the mood was of acceptance. A number of people said it was a risk
fighters were aware of upon entering the ring.
It will be of little consequence to Jim Murray's parents, distraught
behind closed doors. As another media request was politely declined, a
family member explained that Mr Murray's organs would be donated to the
hospital.
It seemed a brave, fitting gesture for a quiet, confident gentleman
whose death will echo out across his own community, throughout Britain,
and around the world of boxing.

JAMES Murray was one of the easiest guys a manager could wish to
handle, his boss Alex Morrison said yesterday.
He did not drink, did not smoke, and lived for three things -- his
boxing, his job as a landscape gardener with Motherwell District
Council, and his family.
It was to try to secure a decent future that he first donned boxing
gloves as an out-of-work 18-year-old at the Cleland Amateur Boxing Club
in Lanarkshire.
''On Friday morning, I told him -- just wait till tomorrow morning and
you'll be famous. But I didn't think it would be because of a tragedy,''
said Mr Morrison.
The other mainstay of the boxer's life was his family. Shortly after
leaving them yesterday, Mr Morrison said: ''They are not blaming
anybody, they are not even blaming themselves for encouraging him to go
into boxing. He lived for it and he got a lot of enjoyment out of it.
''He got up every morning at 5.30 to go running. Then he went to work.
He came into the gym and trained at night. He was one of the fittest.''
Mr Morrison did add: ''I had a premonition something was going to go
wrong with the fight. As I was getting ready to leave home, I told my
wife Anne that I wished I wasn't going and that I feared something was
going to happen to Drew Docherty.
''In the early stages of the fight, my fears grew stronger as Drew
took a lot of punishment. But in the end it was my man, Jim Murray.''
''This blow has left us all shattered and it's very difficult at the
moment for me to say if I will continue in boxing.''
As to the riot which followed the boxing, Mr Morrison said: ''We'll be
studying tapes to see if we can identify the troublemakers.''
Mr Morrison has had his ups and downs. A former boxer, he was banned
from promoting and fined #1000 by the Board of British Boxing Control
after one of his fighters allegedly faked his identity. On appeal, his
licence was restored.
He has twice been bankrupt. He is now a manager and has left promoting
behind because under boxing regulations no-one can hold a promoter's and
a manager's licence at the same time.
James Murray's first trainer, Cleland ABC official Ally Gilmour, said
the boxer took up the sport to ''get himself off the streets''.
''James was 18 when he first came to us,'' he said. ''He wasn't
working at the time and he wanted something to do. I think he wanted to
get himself off the streets. He stayed with us for four years and he was
a game little fighter.
''I suppose some people would say 18 was a late stage to start boxing
but I think any lad up to 22 or 23 can take it up and have a chance.''
Mr Gilmour took Murray to boxing shows all over Scotland as his
amateur career blossomed and he represented his country.
''He was very dedicated. He trained with us Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays and did his roadwork on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I took him to
Ireland in 1993 with Scotland. He was a happy-go-lucky wee guy.
''Later, when he was a gardener with Motherwell district, he simply
worked and trained at his boxing. I don't think he had many other
interests.''
Murray moved on to a couple of other amateur clubs, including the
Lanarkshire Welfare Club before turning professional with Mr Morrison's
stable in Glasgow.

A PROMINENT Glasgow businessman yesterday relived the terrifying
climax to the ill-fated title fight at the Holiday Inn and claimed the
riot could have been avoided if security staff had acted sooner.
The businessman, who has asked not to be named, said he found himself
in the middle of the storm after James Murray collapsed unconscious at
the end of the fight.
He said: ''I have been attending boxing matches in the city for the
past 15 years and the only punches I have seen traded have been in the
ring.
''However, it was obvious what was going to happen almost from the
outset. There were two audiences, the dining set who were suited and on
their best behaviour, and the other audience of between 200 and 300 who
could best be described as a football crowd.
''A lot of them were drunk when they arrived but there was no attempt
to segregate the different sets of supporters.
''A phalanx of between 50 and 60 of them, mainly Murray supporters,
took up one wall and started singing partisan songs. They were
provocative and obscene.
''I had wagered #100 on Docherty but the way I saw the fight going it
was Murray who was on top. Then when Docherty threw the punch which left
Murray on the canvas it was as if the Murray supporters had victory
snatched from their grasp.''
The atmosphere had been like a tinderbox and it was the spark of
Murray losing which had started ''World War Three'', he said.
''There had been a lot of money bet on Murray and it was as if the
world had ended. Bottles, chairs, and tables went flying. I quickly got
up and moved swiftly to the door where I witnessed it all.
''If you saw it on TV, it looked as if people had managed to flee but
they hadn't. They were hiding under their tables. I saw one man on
crutches who had been taking bets get under a table too. There was no
shortage of ammunition for the hooligans who had been drinking from
bottles of beer and bottles of whisky.''
''The type of people the Murray supporters had been taunting -- the
other people standing -- were not the kind of people to run away. This
is not your Whitecraigs set. It was those people who fought back.''
However, the businessman said it could all have been prevented if
security people had acted sooner to break up the phalanx of 50-60 Murray
supporters or had segregated them better.
He added: ''I don't know how they didn't see there was a potential
problem in the corner where the 50 to 60 Murray supporters had gathered.
''If they had been doing their job, the riot might never have
happened.''

THE Scottish Sports Minister's call for an inquiry into the ringside
riot was followed closely by a demand from the Liberal Democrats that
the Government set up a Royal Commission of Inquiry into boxing.
Mr Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on sport, said:
''The tragic death of this fine young man makes it increasingly
difficult to justify boxing as even some senior figures in the sport,
like Frank Warren, have begun to acknowledge.
''It would be foolish to try to reach conclusions in the immediate
aftermath of a tragedy of this kind. But what is now clear is that we
need to take a long, hard look at boxing in this country. It is time for
a Royal Commission.''
Mr Campbell added that he hoped any inquiry would look at the
relationship between alcohol and boxing events. It is understood that at
Friday night's match there were three levels of ticket prices -- #80 and
#50 ''wine and dine tickets'' and #30 simple entry with no food.
Mr Campbell said the question should be posed as to how much the
economics of such events depended on drink rather than food.
''It seems pretty clear that those who started the trouble outside the
ring had far too much to drink. I have no doubt that the licensing board
in Glasgow will want to give some consideration to whether this is the
kind of thing that should be permitted,'' he said.
Meanwhile, Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton is
awaiting reports from the British Board of Boxing Control and the police
into the crowd trouble and is expected to postpone any action about
licensing until these reports are completed.
The Minister said: ''Violent and illegal actions such as those
witnessed are to be wholeheartedly condemned, in particular in the
interests of those who wish sporting events such as this to thrive. The
actions of those responsible for the lawlessness which occurred are
totally unacceptable.''
Lord James, who was an Oxford blue in boxing, is understood to share
Scottish Sports Minister Raymond Robertson's view that boxing should not
be banned as that would simply drive it underground.
However, Mr John McAllion, Labour spokesman on sports, said his
personal view was that the case for professional boxing could no longer
be made.
''Amateur boxing should continue as it is very closely controlled and
nobody really gets hurt. But professional boxing has shown itself to be
far too dangerous. There are far too many people being killed and
seriously injured. It is no longer a sport,'' he said.
Meanwhile, Mr Sam Galbraith, consultant neurosurgeon and Labour MP for
Strathkelvin and Bearsden, called for an urgent research into brain
damage caused by professional boxing.
He said: ''If we cannot get it banned, the least we are entitled to
demand is research which will lead to inescapable conclusions which
nobody will be able to hide from. The bottom line is that the aim in
professional boxing is to inflict brain damage on your opponent. Since
that is the case, nobody should be surprised when tragedies of this
nature occur.''
Mr Galbraith said the quality of medical supervision in professional
boxing was ''quite inadequate''.
He added that for every death which grabbed the headlines there were
many other cases of professional boxers who suffered some degree of
brain damage for the remainder of their lives.
It has also been confirmed that an independent panel set up after the
death of boxer Bradley Stone last year will meet again to discuss the
implications of the death of James Murray.
The panel, chaired by leading consultant neurosurgeon Mr Peter
Richards, is likely to look at issues such as medical facilities at the
ringside and the number and duration of rounds at title fights.
The panel has given the British Boxing Board of Control a number of
recommendations including:
* Replacing CTC brain scans with the more sophisticated magnetic
resonance imaging.
* Reviewing rules governing weigh-ins before matches to ensure boxers
do not dehydrate to meet the weight requirements, thus depriving their
bodies of fluids.
* Looking at the number of rounds in a match and the length of each to
see whether they are too exacting and whether the boxers have competed
over that distance before.
* Considering longer intervals between rounds.
The board's chief medical officer, Mr Adrian Whiteson, who also sits
on the panel, said he expected the board would publish new guidelines
within a month.

Five British medical workers have died in a head-on crash with an
articulated lorry in Swaziland, southern Africa.
The five, four women and one man, worked at a hospital in Natal, said
a Foreign Office spokesman.
Four were in their early 20s, and all five came from southern England,
the spokesman said.
They were heading for a weekend break in Swaziland when the accident
happened on Friday evening.
The five, two doctors and three medical students, had been working at
the Bethesda Hospital in Ubombo.
They were named as Dr Jackie Ford, Dr Catherine Hulme, Ms Lucy
Tringham, Ms Deborah Townsend, and Mr David Whittaker.
Dr Ford was from Hemel Hempstead; Ms Tringham and Ms Townsend students
at Bristol University; Mr Whittaker was a student at University College
Hospital, London; and Dr Hulme had just qualified from Birmingham
University.
According to reports in a Durban-based newspaper, Mr Whittaker had
arrived in South Africa on the day of the crash and the other two
students had been in the country for only two weeks.
Dr Ford had been working at the rural community hospital for some
time. Dr Hulme had joined her there six weeks ago.
The crash happened near the town of Lavumisa, when a lorry went out of
control, the Mercury newspaper said.
Because the crash was in such a remote location, police did not reach
the scene until the early hours of Saturday.
Dr Ford, 26, studied at Guys Hospital, London, and qualified two years
ago.
Hospital superintendent, Dr Jonathan Pons, said staff were ''in
shock'' over the accident.
He said hospitals such as his depended on ''young and selfless''
doctors and medical staff from overseas: ''As rural hospitals we battle
to attract South African doctors because of the poor service conditions,
so many of our personnel are newly-qualified doctors from other
countries, especially Britain.''
The bodies are believed to be at the Matsanjeni Health Centre near the
South African/Swazi border.
Their families were deciding last night whether to fly the bodies back
for burial.
A spokeswoman for Bristol University said Ms Tringham and Ms Townsend
had been just starting their fifth and final year.
''We are all devastated to hear about this, especially as they were
nearing the end of their course and about to start their careers as
doctors,'' she said.
London's University College Hospital and Guy's and Birmingham
University's medical school all said they were unable to comment without
access to personnel files.

THE security firm responsible for stewarding Friday's event said last
night it would be holding an immediate inquiry into what went wrong.
Ms Catherine Potts, of Glasgow-based Central Security Services, said
she doubted whether her firm would ever want to handle security for a
boxing match again.
At her home in Newton Mearns, she said: ''The young chap has died and
I'm just sitting here thinking do I want to do shows like that again.''
Ms Potts refused to answer specific questions on the stewarding of the
boxing contest -- including allegations that people who had been
drinking heavily were not stopped from entering the auditorium -- saying
all inquiries should be referred to the promoters.
''It is their job to speak to everybody. It was their show,'' she
said. Ms Potts could not confirm how many stewards had been on duty or
why, as has been claimed, tickets appear to have been on sale to
all-comers at the door. ''I can't discuss anything until we have looked
into it.''
She did say, however, that stewards from her company would not have
been involved in the decision to sell tickets on the night, adding:
''The stewards would not have known what the capacity was.''
Central Security Services, with offices in West Nile Street, Glasgow,
is believed to employ about 130 stewards. The company, said Ms Potts,
has handled a number of boxing matches before.
Strathclyde Police said that stewards had called the police when
trouble broke out but officers stationed nearby, who had been watching
the fight on television, were already on their way.
Superintendent Bill McMillan, who is co-ordinating the police inquiry
into the riot, said that while security at the private function had been
the responsibility of the promoter, between 30 and 40 policemen had gone
to the Hospitality Inn after the trouble had broken out.
Some of his officers had been watching the fight live on TV in Stewart
Street police station near the hotel. ''They went thundering down the
corridor and out of the office and ran across the road to the
Hospitality Inn.''
No arrests were made. ''When the officers got there their main concern
was for the safety of those around them,'' said Mr McMillan.
''Feelings were running high and their main attention was focused on
trying to prevent a further escalation of violence.''
Mr McMillan said there had been 20 stewards on duty at the boxing
match, which he reckoned was adequate. ''But if people want to start
fights it is difficult to get a level of stewarding to cope. They
couldn't cope and called the police.''
Mr McMillan added it was unfortunate that the riot had taken place in
Glasgow. He said: ''Glasgow in the very distant past had a violent
image. However, violent incidents in the city centre have dropped
dramatically. The city centre is now safer than comparable cities in the
UK. It gives the wrong impression to people who saw it broadcast live.
''The people hurt were from Edinburgh and it is unfair that the city
should shoulder all the blame for the incident.''
Mr Gerry Willard, an administrative steward with the British Boxing
Board of Control (BBBC) in Scotland, declined to comment in detail about
security at the fight because he was not in attendance, but said he did
not think there was any cause for alarm.
''I have been associated with boxing for 37 years and there has never
been any trouble like this before. There have been literally hundreds of
shows at the Kelvin Hall, in hotels, and at open-air venues, and we have
never had any problems.
''These were people who came in looking for trouble and I don't think
there is much you can do to stop people like that.''
He said the BBBC would hold a thorough inquiry into Friday night's
events and would, if it saw fit, use its wide-ranging powers to
implement changes.
Councillor James Coleman, chairman of Glasgow District Council's
licensing board, said that if approached by the police his board would
certainly be looking at the issue of entertainment licences being given
to venues for boxing matches.
No-one from the Hospitality Inn, the venue of Friday night's boxing
match, was prepared to comment.
Another issue likely to be tackled in the wake of the riot is whether
the serving of drink should have been confined to plastic cups rather
than beer glasses and bottles.
Yesterday a spokesman for the Scottish Office said that banning drink
from football matches was a different thing from banning it from
sporting events held in licensed premises such as a hotel.
''The responsibilities have to rest with the event organisers,'' he
said.
The leader of Glasgow District Council, Councillor Pat Lally, said he
was sure that Friday night's events would not tarnish Glasgow's
reputation and that it would be seen as nothing more than an isolated
incidence of violence.
''If there is anyone out there who imagines there are no hooligans in
Glasgow, or their own home town, they are living in a dream world. This
kind of thing will always be a problem from time to time. It has to be
anticipated and dealt with,'' he said.
He added that the supporters of both boxers ''in the main did not
appear to come from Glasgow''.
At least two major boxing matches are scheduled to take place in
Glasgow during the next few weeks.
The first is a Scottish light welter-weight title fight between Steve
McLevy, from Glasgow, and Alan Peacock, of Cumbernauld, which will take
place at the Forte Crest Hotel on October 23. A St Andrews Sporting Club
event, the fight will be a wine-and-dine show with club members only
allowed to attend.
The other is a WBO light-flyweight world title contest between
champion Paul Weir and Baby Jake Matlala at the Kelvin Hall on November
18.

GLASGOW'S hopes of attracting new industry and private housing to the
city are being blighted by the failure to tackle the problem of vacant
and derelict land.
The city has nearly 5000 hectares of brownfield sites, the equivalent
of 12 Ravenscraigs. This is virtually the same area as 15 years ago,
despite a massive clean-up campaign by the Scottish Development Agency
during the 1980s.
While the SDA was tackling the worst of the dereliction caused by the
run-down of Glasgow's heavy industry in the 1970s, more sites were
falling vacant.
Changes in Government policy mean these are no longer being tackled on
the same scale. Current predictions by Strathclyde Regional Council show
that the extent of dereliction in the city in the year 2000 will be the
same as today, 4800 hectares.
The region's final structure plan spells out in grim detail the
consequences of what it calls ''a do-nothing approach''.
The plan, due to be published next month, states: ''The prospect of
more industrial land falling out of use, along with lower rates of
development take-up and environmental treatment, will leave more of the
conurbation blighted by dereliction and unused land.
''This situation will inevitably undo the progress that has been
achieved over the 1980s and will undermine still further the efforts of
the appropriate agencies responsible for marketing the region to
potential developers and investors.''
Councillor Sam McCartney, chairman of the region's planning and
development committee, said yesterday: ''A do-nothing approach will mean
the prospect of Glasgow still having to put right the dereliction
created by nineteenth-century industry in the twenty-first century.''
Most of the sites are smaller than two hectares, an ugly rash of
dereliction spread right across the conurbation, though the worst
problems are concentrated in seven areas: the East End, North Glasgow,
Airdrie and Coatbridge, Ravenscraig, Newmains, Braehead, and North
Paisley.

THE DEATH of Scots boxer James Murray yesterday led to renewed demands
for the sport to be banned as the Scottish Sports Minister ordered an
inquiry into the rioting which followed his collapse in the ring.
Doctors at the Southern General Hospital, Glasgow pronounced him dead
yesterday at 8.50am after satisfying themselves his case met the
criteria for brain death.
The 25-year-old, of Newmains, Lanarkshire, had earlier been knocked
unconscious on Friday night in the last round of a British bantamweight
title fight with champion Drew Docherty, from Condorrat, Dunbartonshire.
It ended in rival supporters rioting in the Hospitality Inn, Glasgow.
The new demands for the sport to be outlawed were led by the British
Medical Association. ''Doctors will continue to warn of the dangers but
it is for society to decide whether it can tolerate the continuing
tragic waste of young lives in the name of sport,'' a spokesman said.
''This is yet another individual tragedy which highlights the fact
that boxing is not a safe sport.'' He said that while boxers' heads
continued to be a target, tragedies would continue.
The independent panel which was formed to advise the British Boxing
Board of Control on the medical issues surrounding the sport after the
death of boxer Bradley Stone last year will meet again to discuss the
implications of Murray's death.
The board's chief medical officer, Mr Adrian Whiteson, who sits on the
panel, said he expected the board would publish new guidelines within a
month.
''We have been looking at ways of making the sport as safe as possible
-- although it can never be 100% safe,'' he said. ''I think that within
the next month there will be an announcement of the recommendations and
we will carry out implementing them so that in the next year everything
which can be done will have been done.''
Sports Minister Raymond Robertson said: ''This was a bad night for
Scottish sport. As far as the violence outside the ring is concerned I
condemn any action of this kind which brings Scottish sport into
disrepute and I have asked my officials for an urgent report into what
happened.
''I do not know if alcohol was a contributory factor but that is one
of the aspects they will be looking into.''
Superintendent Bill McMillan, who is co-ordinating the Strathclyde
police inquiry into the riot, said they hoped to obtain video footage of
the fight from Sky TV.
Mr McMillan said they had received three complaints from people, two
women and one man, injured in the riot. ''We will do everything we can
to bring to justice those persons who acted irresponsibly on the
evening,'' he said.
At his home at Eastwood Drive, Newmains, Murray's father, Kenneth, 54,
said: ''The whole family is devastated, just devastated. My wife
Margaret is bad, very bad.'' He said they were waiting for the doctor to
see her.
Docherty said he and his manager, Mr Tommy Gilmour, were shattered.
''Words just cannot express how badly we feel about James's death. Our
thoughts are with his family and friends.''
Mr Alex Morrison, Murray's manager, said he was reviewing his own
future in boxing.
''The question we have got to ask ourselves is, 'Would you let your
own son be a boxer?' -- and I would not like my son to be a boxer,''
said Mr Morrison, who had been a boxer himself.
His daughter Katherine Morrison, 26, who has worked as a boxing
promoter for the past five years, and who promoted Friday's fight along
with Frank Warren, was also unlikely to continue working in the boxing
world, he said. ''She is absolutely shattered.''
Promoter Frank Warren said his thoughts and those of everyone in the
boxing community are with the Murray family. He said that ''Drew
Docherty must also be going through a terrible time''.
Mr Warren said he had planned to fly up to Glasgow but had decided,
even before the news of Murray's death, to cancel. ''I am not going now.
I am sure the family would prefer to be by themselves than have people
they don't really know with them.''
He said that the real dilemma facing the sport was how to make it
safer while sustaining the interest. He said: ''Monitoring boxers'
welfare in fights is determined by the annual medicals they go through
and examinations before and after a fight.
''We can improve on them but that would mean bringing in an MRI
scanner which is quite expensive. I think boxing, promoters and the BBBC
have to look at how they can fund this so that boxers can get this
service.''
He added: ''There are guys who are born fighting men and they do want
to fight. If there wasn't a BBBC they would fight anyway.
''The sport might go underground or go abroad which has happened with
boxers banned by the BBBC. But there are times like this when it is hard
to justify boxing.''
One of the worst weekends in British boxing history began around 11pm
on Friday night in the luxurious surroundings of Glasgow's four-star
Hospitality Inn.
The event was not a sell-out, possibly because it was being televised.
It is understood, however, that 50% of tickets were given to the
promoters to sell and the remaining 50% split between the two boxers to
sell to friends and relatives.
Murray, the Scottish bantamweight champion, was challenging Docherty
for the British crown. He was floored by a flurry of blows from Docherty
towards the end of the 12th and final round.
The unconscious Murray was still being treated by two doctors in the
ring as the violence erupted. In scenes that brought shame on the sport,
bottles and glasses and chairs were thrown.
Some blamed the violence on sectarian differences, others on the
presence of a number of soccer ''casuals''.
The secterian allegation, with Docherty having been based at the
boxing club in Croy, a mainly Roman Catholic village, was the root cause
of the riot were dismissed as both boxers were Protestant.
Mr Morrison said he had known the Docherty camp for 20-odd years and
that while there had always been friendly rivalry, that was as far as it
went.
Mr David McKendrick, a Motherwell district councillor, said: ''Two
coach loads of supporters went from here on Friday and there was a mix
of Catholic and Protestant all rooting for James. There's no religious
divide in Newmains and I don't believe there was any at the fight.''
Mr McMillan said drink ''had a large part to play in it but it was
just basically hooliganism''.
He dismissed a tabloid suggestion that a gang of Edinburgh casuals had
been involved. ''Boxing would be outwith their normal line of activity.
They are generally related to football and I've heard nothing to suggest
they have extended their interest to boxing.''
He also dismissed reports that the fighting was sparked by
sectarianism.
Five spectators were taken to hospital but released after treatment
for cuts and grazes.
Police were called but made no arrests, although they are now
investigating three complaints of alleged assault.
However, the death of Murray has overshadowed the controversy over
these scenes.
His battle for life was fought in the Neurological Sciences Institute
at the Southern General Hospital.
His family -- including father Kenny, mother Margaret, and brothers
David and Roddy -- kept a constant vigil, along with his manager, Mr
Morrison.
On Friday night, Murray had a 90-minute operation to remove a blood
clot from his brain. On Saturday night, Murray's exhausted parents were
advised to go home, but they could not leave his bedside.
Yesterday Mr Garth Cruickshank, the consultant neurosurgen who carried
out Friday's operation, confirmed that Murray was dead.
On Saturday, the boxer had initially been critically ill but stable.
However, during the day he had slowly deteriorated, said the consultant.
''By late yesterday, all signs of neurological activity were extinct. We
performed a set of criteria then to establish whether that was the
case,'' said Mr Cruickshank. ''I again carried out a set of brain death
criteria this morning, and pronounced Mr Murray dead at 08.50.''

THE man at the centre of one of Scotland's most controversial murder
cases, George Beattie, was last night back in prison for allegedly
breaching parole conditions.
Beattie, 41, who had been living in Slough since being released under
licence in March, is believed to have had his parole conditions revoked
for verbally abusing a parole officer.
Friends said the door of his flat was broken down by officers of
Thames Valley Police at 3am on Saturday and he was taken to prison in
Oxfordshire.
Mr Peter Hill, the BBC producer who made the Rough Justice Programmes
which campaigned against his sentence, said he now feared for Beattie's
well being.
Mr Hill said ''he told me that if he was ever taken back to jail he
would commit suicide''.
It is Beattie's fourth spell in prison since, at 19 in 1973, he was
convicted of the murder of typist Margaret McLaughlin, 23, found stabbed
to death in a wooded glen at Carluke, Lanarkshire. He has always
maintained his innocence and vowed to fight for a Royal Pardon.
He was first paroled in 1986 but went back to prison six years later.
He was released again in January 1994, pending his appeal against the
murder conviction, but was back in prison 11 months later when the
appeal failed.
The Scottish Office said his return to custody followed a
recommendation by the Parole Board for Scotland four days ago.
''Following that recommendation the Secretary of State for Scotland has
revoked his life licence and directed that he be recalled to custody.''
Since being granted freedom, his public service vehicle licence has
been reissued and he has been working as a bus driver in Slough where he
had his own flat. ''He was doing well and was quite proud of himself,''
Mr Hill said. ''I have been told that the police turned up in three
squad cars, blocked off the roads and broke the door down. It is
incredible.''
The Scottish Office said Beattie would be notified of the reason for
his detention and would have the right to challenge the recommendation.
If this succeeded, the parole board could order his re-release, but
otherwise he would resume serving his life sentence.
