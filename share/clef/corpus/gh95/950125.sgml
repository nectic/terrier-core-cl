IN Victorian times you might have come to this spa town to partake of
the saline waters in the Well House. Nowadays you are more likely to
make the journey to sample some of the best ice cream in Scotland at the
Allan Water Cafe.
Others enjoy the pleasures of the traditional shops, including Clive
Ramsay's, the BBC Good Food Shop of the Year, and the excellent pubs,
restaurants and hotels - including The Old Manor owned by the former
captain of Rangers, Terry Butcher.
Bridge of Allan lies halfway betwen Sitrling and Dunblane, and if you
are lucky enough to live in this up-market residential town you will
also enjoy sports clubs, a nine-hole golf course, the beautiful setting
of the University of Stirling Campus with community membership available
to use the facilites, and the music, theatre and cinema of the MacRobert
Arts Centre.
Parks, woods (Sheriffmuir is a wooded wilderness behind Bridge of
Allan) and the Allan Water offer open-air amenities.
Commuting throughout Central Scotland is comparatively easy as Bridge
of Allan boasts a direct rail service to Edinburgh and Glasgow, and
benefits from access to the motorway network via the M9 two miles away.
Education needs are served by the village primary, the state-run
Wallace High School at nearby Causewayhead, and private sector schooling
at Beaconhurst Grange.
Not surprising then that Bridge of Allan, with a nice blend of old and
new homes, has traditionally had a very strong property market. Among
those who have been attracted to the town are relocating executives from
companies such as BP at Grangemouth.
There is a split within the town depending which side of Henderson
Street you live on. Up the hill is Upper Bridge of Allan, and this is
the preferred area, which is reflected in higher prices. Here you will
find a large number of stone villas and conversions (notably the Allan
Water Apartments, converted in the Eighties from the spa hotel) in
impressive grounds.
On the other side of the street, the properties in Lower Bridge of
Allan are smaller.
One modern estate in Upper Bridge of Allan is the Walker-built
Westerton Estate, including Rutherford Court, John Murray Drive,
Churchill Drive and Hopetoun Drive, where prices run at around #150,000.
Julie Frickleton, who works for Slater Hogg &amp; Howison, and lived there
as a child says: 'Growing up in Bridge Of Allan was very safe, with lots
to do and easy access to Stirling on a Saturday. The only bad point was
being called a snob at the Wallace High School'.
Duncan Fergusson, valuer at Slater, Hogg, says: 'Amenities are
top-notch and all of Bridge of Allan is well regarded, with the nicest
properties perhaps at Chalton Road, Kennilworth Road, Abercromby Drive
and Claremont Drive'.
Sheila Davie, negotiator at GA, says: 'It tends to be quite pricey, as
one of the most select areas in Stirlingshire. Even an ex-local
authority property, like the one we have on at the moment, commands a
premium.'
Martin Turner, manager at Clyde Property, currently marketing two
properties on Henderson Street, says: 'Prices peaked four or five years
ago and the mid-range now sells steadily, comparable to Bearsden, Newton
Mearns and the South Side of Glasgow.'
Brian Moran, valuer at Gloria Gauld says: 'There is no problem in
selling in Bridge of Allan, from one-bedroom flats at #45,000 in
Henderson Street to houses at #200,000, as it is seen as 'the' place to
be.'
Fiona Bayne, office manager at Allen &amp; Harris, says: 'The market has
picked up since last year, which was patchy. Upper Bridge of Allan may
have a snob value, but Lower Bridge of Allan is handier for the local
primary school and the walk to the shops doesn't entail a trek uphill on
the return.'

THE new flagship CALA development is at Sherbrooke Gardens,
Pollokshields, an exclusive enclave of just 17 luxury five-bedroom homes
offering a peaceful setting and fast access to the city centre.
A showhome opens in March, and prices are from #215,000 to #251,000.
''Sherbrooke Gardens offers everything you could wish for in a location,
beautiful surroundings, privacy and security -- and the homes are truly
sumptuous,'' said sales and marketing manager Isobel Watt.
Also offering the combination of amenity with accessibility, the CALA
development at Waterside Gardens, Bishopbriggs is close to the Campsie
Fells and Cawder Golf Club, river and loch fishing are available locally
and Lennox Forest is practically on the doorstep, yet Glasgow city
centre is only minutes away via excellent road and rail links.
An excellent neighbourhood development of 56 individual four and
five-bedroom properties, all with traditional CALA style and
spaciousness, fitted kitchens and bathrooms, prices start at #141,000,
and a new showhome opens next month.
Only a few homes remain to be sold at the successful Kings Rise
development in Bearsden, at prices from #184,000 and the magnificent
showhome is well worth a visit.
Just two villas remain to be sold at the Marchbank development in
Ralston, and since they are outstanding homes competitively priced,
should be viewed by interested parties quickly.
CALA two and three-bedroom flats at Kirklee Wynd in Kelvinside are
attracting a great deal of attention; the strikingly designed apartment
buildings have received much favourable comment. Also competitively
priced at from #91,000, sales are expected to be strong at this
development.
Eaglerise, bordering the superb Westerwood Golf and Country Club and
overlooking the 18-hole championship golf course co-designed by Seve
Ballesteros, is one of CALA's most innovative developments, and with
prices starting at #135,000, popular with today's homebuyers.
''Home buyers want a sound investment, as well as a good home, and
CALA's success reflects these twin concerns of the housebuilding
industry's customers,'' said Alan Downie. ''Although the housebuilding
industry is not flying high, there are customers out there to attract.

POLICE are hunting three men after a break-in at a castle.
The men, who were carrying a ladder, were spotted inside Eilean Donan
Castle in Ross-shire on Monday evening. However nothing appears to have
been taken from the thirteenth century building, which contains displays
of historical items from the Jacobite rebellions.
Police say the men must have got into the castle between Friday and
Monday. They made off in a yellow or orange-coloured Transit van.
A Northern Constabulary spokesman appealed for anyone who saw anything
suspicious in the area to contact them.
Eilean Donan, which sits on an island in Loch Duich, near Dornie, on
the road to Skye, is one of the most photographed castles in the
Highlands.
It was built by Alexander II to repel Vikings and later became the
stronghold of the Mackenzies of Kintail, who installed the MacRae clan
as hereditary keepers.
The castle was destroyed in 1719 during an abortive Jacobite uprising
and lay in a ruined state until the 1930s when it was completely
refurbished.

<HEADLINE>Age and ill health save sex abuser from prison</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>980189304</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN 82-year-old child sex abuser was fined #500 yesterday after a
sheriff was told that he could die in prison if he was jailed.
Wallace Donaldson, of Abban Street, Inverness, had admitted lewd,
indecent, and libidinous behaviour towards a young girl on various
occasions between January 1977 and January 1982.
Donaldson admitted the offences at Inverness Sheriff Court earlier
this month, but sentence had been deferred for medical reports.
Mr Peter Gray, QC, defending, said a fresh medical report concluded
that Donaldson, a first offender, was fit to be jailed, but also stated
that he suffered from chronic bronchitis and heart problems, and the
physical and mental stress of imprisonment might mean he could die in
prison.
He added: ''I would urge your lordship to have regard not only to his
age, his health, previous good character, and the fact that the offences
were committed many years ago, but perhaps more importantly the fact
that because of his conduct he has become an isolated man in the
community and that is unlikely to change.''
Sheriff William Fulton said it was ''unfortunate'' that the offences
had not come to light earlier, when he could have jailed Donaldson.
He said: ''I think the balance of the medical reports is against a
custodial sentence, which I have to confess I regard as unfortunate.
''A custodial sentence would have been entirely appropriate.''
Earlier this month the court heard Donaldson's victim did not report
the matter until years later when she was 17 and receiving treatment for
depression brought on by the abuse.
Mr Gray told the court that Donaldson had been attracted to his
victim, partly because she looked older than she was and because he had
misinterpreted her behaviour towards him.
Last night, Donaldson's victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons,
said: ''A fine is certainly not enough for what he put me through.
''I thought he should be jailed. I was abused over five years, that is
#100 for each year. It just doesn't seem right.

MOVES to deal with the crisis in elderly care and speed up the closure
of sub-standard residential homes have been proposed by Scotland's
largest regional authority.
Strathclyde is suggesting legislation that would empower a designated
officer to approach a sheriff at any hour of the day or night and seek
the closure of a home, should residents' lives be at risk.
The council is also calling for registration of residential homes to
be renewable every five years, so that there can be an on-going
assessment of care standards.
Both suggestions came from Councillor Walter MacLellan,
Langside/Shawlands.
''At present it's easier to close a dirty pub than close a home where
vulnerable people are living in poor conditions,'' said Mr MacLellan
after yesterday's meeting of the social work sub-committee on community
care.
The council, still smarting from criticism by a sheriff at a fatal
accident inquiry that it was slow to close a particularly ghastly
residential home in Glasgow last year, has also revised its own
procedures to speed up the closure process.
Appeals by owners to the Scottish Secretary against deregistration can
take between 10 and 12 months. Strathclyde now wants that process
limited to two months.
At present, Strathclyde has 156 residential homes for elderly people
on its register. The council has cancelled the registration of three
homes.
Enforcement action is currently in progress in relation to three more.
In addition, there is a small number of homes where formal action is
under consideration.
Last year two residential homes were closed by Strathclyde region,
after reports of elderly people being maintained in poor and sometimes
horrific conditions.
The death of an elderly lady who had been resident in Glenglova
Residential Home, Glasgow, owned by Dr Rada Sarker, led to a fatal
accident inquiry.
At the close of the inquiry Sheriff Daniel Convery condemned the
home's regime, saying elderly people had been kept like livestock for
money.
In December, the Social Work Department cancelled the registration of
Caldwell House, Uplawmoor, Renfrewshire, owned by Dr Sohair Chaudhry,
following an adverse report by social work inspectors.

<RECORDNO>980189306</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
HIGHLANDS and Islands Enterprise is to discuss with ScotRail a radical
plan to help fund the purchase of railway coaches for the West Highland
Line.
The railway pressure group, Friends of the West Highland Line, last
week called on the agency to finance the purchase of a fleet of
loco-hauled coaches for use by ScotRail on services from Glasgow to Oban
and Fort William.
The group said that loco-hauled services which operated last summer
had been axed because of a #1.8m charge being demanded by a leasing
company for use of the 30-year-old coaches.
Its spokesman, Mr Tom Ellett, warned that the withdrawal of the
loco-hauled trains would leave Oban and Fort William with the ''worst
summer service in Scotland'', where luggage-laden passengers would be
crammed into Sprinter trains unable to accommodate them.
Mr Ellet said yesterday that he had now received a reply from HIE
chief executive, Mr Iain Robertson, who said that he was arranging for
staff to look into the proposal of providing assistance for the purchase
of coaches and that he would also be discussing it at a forthcoming
meeting with ScotRail's director, Mr Chris Green.
He added: ''I am encouraged, and I hope they will be able to do
something to ensure that we have more than Sprinters for this summer.
''What I would like to see is an early morning loco-hauled train from
Glasgow going back south at night -- ideal for hillwalkers and
day-trippers.''

IF home care superstores sold bottled atmosphere they could make an
overnight fortune. Some houses never quite achieve that elusive mood
that makes them instantly relaxing or restful.
Rooms full of brand new sofas and deep pile carpets are not the only
ingredients for feeling at home.
Perhaps it's the way Margaret Ross leans on her window sills and
watches the world go by that helps make her home seem so calming. Or it
could be the pretty green wallpaper in the sitting room at Morlich,
Gateside Road, Barrhead. It's patterned with foliage that mirrors the
horse chestnut trees across the road.
''I think green is a very restful colour,'' she says.
Before you realise it, you're leaning alongside her looking out on to
her terraced garden that falls away down a hillside.
Her traditional brick-built house is a no-nonsense family home with
most of the main rooms facing south to the front, and catching the sun
whenever it chooses to shine.
The main hall has a sitting room and dining room squarely on either
side, though the dining room is big enough to double as a television
room.
A timber picture rail has been added to give the room extra finish and
Margeret uses it to show off her collection of wall plates.
Double-glazed bay windows are a feature of both rooms with their
generous solid wood sills, wide enough for ornaments, or elbows.
The sitting room has a brick fire surround and a gas-flame fire. There
is also gas central heating, with the boiler tucked away in the large
utility room beyond the kitchen.
Here a row of fitted cupboards gives extra storage space as well as
room to accommodate the washing machine.
A double-glazed door leads to the kitchen where dark wooden fitted
cupboards have been topped by a cream work surface and a double
cream-coloured sink.
There are toning tiles on the walls, while around the dining table and
chairs sits in a corner beneath more wall cupboards. The window looks
onto the large rear garden.
Tucked away down a couple of stairs is a useful cloakroom and loo with
a hand basin in one corner, both in a smart shade of terracotta.
The staircase turns beneath a large window, which Margaret has given a
very traditional mood with some with tartan curtains.
The fourth bedroom, which is also used as a study, leads off the
stairs and is the only room looking on to back of the house.
Upstairs there are three bedrooms leading off the landing where some
bedtime reading is stored in two bookcases.
The main bedroom has been carefully fitted out with a wall of cream
wardrobes smartly trimmed with pale wood. Matching drawers and a
dressing table are built in on each side of the bed. The cream papered
walls are finished with a beautiful rose patterned frieze.
The two other bedrooms both offer ample space for the teenage children
of the family to spread out. There are built-in cupboards in both, while
the second bedroom even has space for a sofa.
The bathroom has been given a green and cream theme, too. Just right
for relaxing in the sage coloured bath.
As well as a hand shower at the taps, there is also a separate shower
cubicle. Beneath the window is another ample pine sill which extends
into a useful shelf space for towels.
The room looks on to a terrace at the top of the garden filled with
flowering shrubs. On the level below, a lawn runs across the width of
the garden, while to the side of the house is a paved patio.
A separate double brick garage has easy access from the road.
While Barrhead railway station is just five minutes away, Fereneze
Braes are just walking distance along the road -- a pleasant stroll past
more detached villas in their secluded gardens leading to open
countryside and farmland.

<HEADLINE>No protection from the referee, claims Evans</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>32</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980189308</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LIVERPOOL manager Roy Evans launched a verbal assault on referee Brian
Hill after his side's ill-tempered Merseyside derby with Everton ended
goalless.
Evans declared himself ''angry and frustrated'' at the way Everton's
fiercely combative style had stopped his side from developing their
game, and he made it clear he felt the Kettering official had not
protected his players.
''I just think the referee didn't do his job,'' said Evans. ''We tried
to play the attacking brand of football, and fluency is a big part. But
every time we went past, our player was brought down.
''They had four booked in the first half, but the referee didn't
continue that in the second and we didn't get the protection we
deserved.''
Dave Watson, Joe Parkinson, David Burrows, and David Unsworth were the
four men to pick up yellow cards in the opening period.
Evans added: ''I don't like seeing people sent off, but if they're
stopping us playing by bringing us down we can't get the fluency that is
part of our game.
''Every time we got past their back four we were fouled. It just
spoiled it for the fans.''
Everton manager Joe Royle, not surprisingly, took a different view,
saying: ''That was a good point. We can, and will, play a lot better,
but defensively we were top-notch and Neville Southall didn't have a
save to make.''
Royle added: ''It was a fervent game and I was disappointed that all
the bookings were one way in the first half because although I can't
disagree with them I thought there should have been some balancing out
at some stage.''
As for the battling qualities shown by his team Royle said: ''We've
got to have that, we've got to take it for granted.
''I've seen plenty of teams come here and lie down in the past. We
certainly weren't going to do that and big Duncan Ferguson might have
nicked it at the end.''
Leeds manager Howard Wilkinson said last night that record signing
Tony Yeboah would make his full debut only when the time was right.
Wilkinson resisted the temptation to give the #3.4m striker his first
start for the Yorkshire side in the 4-0 Premiership victory over Queens
Park Rangers.
The Ghanaian -- signed after weeks of red tape from Eintracht
Frankfurt -- only appeared for the final six minutes after two goals
from Phil Masinga and one apiece from Brian Deane and David White had
given Leeds their first home win in the Premiership for two months.
''At the end of the day my job is to pick the best team. If I think
the best team has got him in it then I will pick him,'' said Wilkinson,
who would not reveal whether Yeboah would play in Saturday's FA Cup
fourth round game against Oldham.
At Highbury, the Arsenal hoodoo continued as Matthew Le Tissier carved
out a Southampton equaliser for Jim Magilton 16 minutes from the end
after Gunners new boy John Hartson had fired his second goal in two
games.

PARTICK Thistle could become the first team in Scotland to be
relegated and still qualify for European football next season. The
Firhill side are Scotland's only surviving nominees for the Intertoto
Cup and, unless UEFA veto their participation, they would be involved in
the new tournament designed to give the chance of back-door entry to the
UEFA Cup for clubs who do not make it by other routes.
Six Scottish clubs had indicated an interest in the competition, which
probably will be made up of 12 groups of five teams, but Hearts,
Motherwell, Kilmarnock, Falkirk, and Hibs all dropped out.
The demands of the new competition, and the dates when it is to be
played, mean that the clubs would face a non-stop season, playing in
June and July, and if successful, contesting the preliminary round of
the UEFA Cup before going straight into the new season.
Qualifying the Intertoto way is difficult. Out of 60 starters in
mid-June, only four will survive to the preliminary round, to be played
between July 24 and August 6, producing the two teams going into the
tournament proper.
SFA chief executive Jim Farry warned clubs of the pressures on players
which would result in taking part in the cup, which is another UEFA
device to force countries to reduce domestic commitments and thus allow
more European participation.
None the less, Farry has forwarded Partick's nomination along with
relevant information regarding their league status, and where they could
be by the end of the season. ''It will be up to UEFA to decide if they
will let teams who could be relegated take part. All we can do is
provide the details.''
If Thistle fail in their spirited bid to get away from bottom place in
the table, but make it through to the preliminary round of the UEFA Cup,
it could mean that Scotland would have two first division sides in
Europe next season. Raith Rovers, who have qualified for the UEFA Cup by
winning the Coca-Cola Cup, are no certainties to win promotion.

<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT Minister has given the first public assurance that the
#120m RD 57 Trident dock at Rosyth will not be used as a graveyard for
decommissioned nuclear submarines.
At a news conference at Rosyth, Defence Procurement Minister Roger
Freeman said: ''The RD 57 will not be used as a nuclear graveyard.
''I cannot say at this stage what it will be used for -- perhaps it
will be filled in and used for industrial development or the Royal Navy
may have a marine use for it, but it will not be used as a graveyard for
decommissioned nuclear submarines.''
The chairman of the industrial unions at the dockyard, Mr Brian Negus,
said: ''This is the first time anyone from the Government has given such
an undertaking.
''The local population will be so relieved that their fears of living
beside a nuclear dump are now groundless.''
Mr Freeman also met representatives from the Bank of Scotland,
ScottishPower, Babcock International, and Forth Ports Authority who make
up Rosyth 2000.
The group has been formed to bid for and develop all the MoD land in
the Rosyth area, which will be put up for sale some time this year.
He said afterwards: ''They have put up plans for industrial
development, a science park, marine development, and residential and
leisure facilities as well as private housing. It is a unique example of
public and private co-operation.
''We have to work for the regeneration of this area once the military
side of the naval base adjoining the dockyard is withdrawn, and we have
got to make progress before the end of this year.''
Rosyth 2000's acting chairman and general manager of the Bank of
Scotland, Mr Gavin Masterton, said: ''Our first priority is to create
jobs.
''I see little difficulty in raising the necessary finance. We hope to
submit detailed plans to Government in March.''

<HEADLINE>Fans' #7m act of faith 7000 dig into their pockets for Celtic</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CELTIC fans have raised at least #7m for the club in a staggering
response to its share issue -- well and truly confining to the dustbin
the old jokes about a biscuit-tin philosophy towards finances at
Parkhead.
The supporters' input so exceeded expectations that they not only
wiped out a #3m underwriting by club directors but over-subscribed the
offer by at least #2m.
Its success, the best ever in British football, means about #11.4m --
less expenses -- is now available towards redeveloping the stadium and
buying players.
Manager Tommy Burns was already due to receive #4m to boost the squad
before the target figure was surpassed. That spending power is likely to
increase even further under a promise from managing director Fergus
McCann that Burns will receive ''the lion's share'' from the share
issue.
But an extraordinary general meeting will have to be called to agree
that more shares can be issued to meet all applications received from
fans by yesterday's closing deadline.
Celtic's prospectus, issued last month, was designed to raise #9.4m --
a net #8.9m after expenses -- if fully subscribed.
The minimum subscription already stood at #7m -- via a pre-placed #4m
shares' package with Dermot Desmond's QFS Financial Services, of Dublin,
and a #3m underwriting, including #2m from two Celtic directors and
McCann, club chairman.
To reach the target, the public needed to contribute a further #2.4m
-- an impossible dream, according to some observers because of Celtic's
troubles both on and off the field.
It looked as if they would be proved right, until Friday when a
last-minute rush to invest led to lengthy queues at registration points
lasting until closing time at 10am yesterday.
It is understood at least 7000 people have bought shares -- with an
average spend of #1057. Their #7m not only cancels out the underwriting
but, with #4m already in from QFS, means that Celtic's coffers have
swelled by over #11m.
The fans will still, in total, control only a fraction of Celtic's
equity base -- now put at #24m. McCann will still control a majority of
the ordinary voting shares in Celtic.
The issue's success -- even surpassing Manchester United's
record-breaking sales -- is being put down to fans being offered a real
say as shareholders in the club, run by family dynasties until McCann's
arrival.
Despite smashing the target, it is unlikely there will be a repeat
issue in the near future, according to club sources. They believe
finances are on a solid footing, and that future income is largely
dependent upon the team's success and completion of the new stadium.
Only if the team continued to struggle, and gates fell, would another
issue be considered, perhaps in three years' time.
But question marks still exist over funding to complete the club's
proposed 60,000 all-seated stadium, costing in excess of #30m.
There have been no guarantees that the east and west stands, behind
the goals, will be built by the 1996 completion date indicated in the
share offer prospectus.
Celtic may still be forced to borrow millions to go beyond building
only the 26,740-seat north stand, scheduled for next season's August
start.
However, the money raised in the share issue must go on redeveloping
Celtic Park and on new players, according to the prospectus drawn up by
stockbrokers' Greig Middleton.
Hugh Nash, a director of Greig Middleton, said of the issue, snapped
up by the public with no institutions involved: ''It has exceeded
expectations. Everyone is delighted. We are now trying to seek a way to
satisfy all the applicants.''
McCann described the issue as ''a phenomenal success,'' and thanked
everyone who showed such ''incredible'' support for Celtic. He added:
''We are putting together a plan so that all applicants will be able to
receive the number of shares requested.''
A supplementary issue is likely to be agreed after an EGM is called to
resolve the problem of oversubscription.
Fans, to become shareholders in Celtic plc, had to pay a minimum #620,
which offered five #1 ordinary and five #60 preference shares. Benefits,
to take up the offer, included priority listing for seats when ordering
season tickets and 10% discounts in merchandise at Celtic shops.
Four other levels -- up to a maximum of #62,000 -- were also offered.
Not all 18 places in the highest level, the ambassador club, were taken
up.

TREASURE dredged up last year from a sunken ship off the Malaysian
coast is expected to fetch more than #1m in March, Christie's in London
announced yesterday.
The 24,000 undamaged pieces of Chinese porcelain, preserved in 3ft of
silt since 1817, when the cargo ship Diana sank off Malacca, will be
exhibited in Christie's in Glasgow from 19 to 21 February.
The pieces will then travel to be shown in Brussels before going to
Amsterdam for a two-day auction on 6 and 7 March.
After a three-year search covering 28 miles of the seabed, the wreck
of the Diana was found by Dorian Ball, a South African researcher,
historian, and diver.
His company, Malaysian Historical Salvors, with a contract from the
Malaysian Government, excavated the wreck and her contents during the
first six months of last year, without a single accident, despite poor
underwater visibility, strong currents, and daily storms.
''The ship hit a rock in a calm sea,'' said Mr Colin Sheaf, director
of Christie's Chinese department. She was on her way from Canton, after
depositing a cargo of opium there, to Madras.
Mud protected the porcelain from damage for more than 170 years.
The Malaysian Government, which is selling the cargo, for which Mr
Ball is compensated, is keeping about 50 of the total of 1200 lots, for
the International Museum in Kuala Lumpur.

<HEADLINE>Palmer leaves Legacy to Philippines Arnie and President team up to open new course</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
AFTER the Pope, the Philippines this week welcomes two golfers who
have themselves attracted worshipful congregations running into millions
over the past 40 years in Arnold Palmer and Seve Ballesteros.
Palmer partnered President Fidel Ramos over nine holes to mark the
opening of the Legacy course he has designed alongside one built by Gary
Player at the Orchard Club in Manila and Ballesteros partnered his
caddie, six-handicapper Billy Foster, and a former Miss Hong Kong,
Olivia Yu in a celebrity shoot-out.
While Ballesteros will stay on to join up with Greg Norman, Nick
Price, Fred Couples, Ernie Els, and Colin Montgomerie in the #600,000
Johnnie Walker Classic, Palmer, who has designed some 200 courses and
has around 40 more under construction, heads for home, but he confirmed
he will be at St Andrews for his Open Championship farewell in July.
He is hoping to bow out on a high note by at least surviving all four
rounds, having missed a record low cut by a single stroke at what was to
have been his final appearance at the home of golf in the 1990
championship.
It is a great disappointment, he admitted, never to have won the Open
over the Old Course where, on his debut in 1960 following victories in
the US Masters and US Open he had to give second best to the Australian,
Kel Nagle.
He took the title in 1961 at Royal Birkdale and in 1962 at Troon but
was ''over-golfed and exhausted'' and decided not to cross the Atlantic
when the championship returned to St Andrews in 1964.
Ironically, Palmer's putter and his Scots caddie, Tip Anderson, played
a vital part in the outcome.
He recalled: ''I lent them both to Tony Lema and he won after I had
told him that, although people say you can't attack the course, he
should be as aggressive as he felt. He told me it helped him greatly.''
Palmer's love affair with the Old Course goes back to boyhood: ''I'd
read all about Opens, Amateur Championships, and Walker Cups there and
about the deeds of Walter Hagen, Sam Snead, and Frank Stranahan and
although I was aware of the Muirfields, Turnberrys, and Birkdales, St
Andrews was the place I wanted to play.
''I had a few words I won't repeat to say about it at first but the
more I played it and got to understand it the more I enjoyed it.
''You wouldn't get away with designing a course like it today. The
development of the golf ball and square-grooved clubs has made it much
easier. I can remember hitting shots in with V-grooves and being unable
to spin the ball and stop it.''
Following emotional farewells to the US Open and PGA Championships
last year, Palmer insisted it will be positively his last outing in the
Open but as an honorary member of the R &amp; A he says he will return to
play in this year's or next year's Autumn Medal.
Palmer's Scots manager, Alistair Johnston, revealed that Gary Player
will follow Jack Nicklaus in being bestowed with an honorary degree by
the University of St Andrews this year and it would surely be fitting if
a man who has done more than anyone else to spread the golfing gospel
around the globe was to follow Bobby Jones as a Freeman of the City of
St Andrews.
Ballesteros has played only 27 holes of golf and hit around 200
practice balls since last month's Johnnie Walker World Championship in
Jamaica after having suffered a bout of flu but he will have completed a
round-the-world trip by the time he competes on home soil for the first
time in the Canaries on February 9.
He will link up next week in Palm Springs, California with his mentor,
Mac O'Grady, to whom much of the credit must go for the Spaniard's
return to top form with two victories last summer.
It resulted in him finishing the year top of the Ryder Cup points
table and he insisted: ''I want to get back to my peak as soon as
possible and stay there. Making the side should not be difficult but I
want to be playing well enough to be useful to the team.''
Seve, no doubt thinking of how he asked to be rested for the final
four-ball, then lost in the singles in 1993, is experimenting with a
large-headed ''Fat Lady'' putter similar to the one used by world No.1
Price. If she does not swiftly sing for him he will switch back to the
putter which earned him nearly #600,000 in Europe last year.

<HEADLINE>Pensioner gets five years for sex abuse</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>980189315</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A PENSIONER was jailed for five years yesterday for subjecting two
young girls to ''very terrible'' sexual abuse over more than a decade.
John Murrie, 67, was a visitor to the girls' former family home in
Falkirk, where the children would help him with his hobby of jigsaw
puzzles.
But Murrie, of Westfield Street, Falkirk, took advantage of the
situation to prey on the youngsters.
He turned his attention first to the older girl and began indecently
touching her and simulating sexual intercourse with her when she was
aged 12.
But his first victim later became involved with a boyfriend and Murrie
then turned on the second girl, who was aged seven when he began
committing indecent acts against her.
By the time the girl was 11, he had begun having intercourse with her.
Murrie admitted three indecency charges, and a charge of unlawful
sexual intercourse.
The judge, Lord Milligan, told him: ''You have pleaded guilty to
offences involving a lengthy course of conduct of very terrible sexual
abuse of two young girls.
''I am told you appreciate the seriousness of what you did to them,
and that I will take into account, because in cases of this type,
sometimes efforts are made to belittle the effect of conduct of this
kind.
''As I understand the position, it is likely to involve appalling
psychological consequences for the children concerned, if not
immediately, at least as they grow older.''
Advocate-depute James Campbell told the court that the abuse came to
the attention of the authorities when Murrie's first victim went to the
police and social workers.
The younger victim has since received counselling because of her
intervention.
Defence counsel Douglas Small said Murrie, a first offender, had lived
alone since the death of his wife in 1987.
He said that Murrie appreciated the seriousness of the offences and
the consequences for the victims and that, by pleading guilty, he had
spared the victims the ordeal of having to come to court to give
evidence.

SHANDWICK'S shareholders are to receive an annual dividend after two
years without a payout, the public relations group revealed yesterday.
The company enjoyed strong earnings growth last year and that has
carried on with income and profits significantly ahead of the
corresponding period in 1994, it said.
However, chairman Peter Gummer, brother of Environment Minister John
Gummer, said pressure on the dollar and interest rate worries were
likely to present future problems. ''Operationally the consultancies in
the group are now trading very strongly, but the weakening of the dollar
and upward pressure on interest rates temper our optimism.''
During the year to the end of October taxable profits rocketed 53% to
#7.3m against #4.8m in the previous 12 months.
The total dividend payout is 1.3p. The last time investors received a
dividend was for the year to October 31, 1991, when they were paid 3.33p
per share. Earnings per share amounted to 4.1p compared with 1.8p.
Shandwick's UK operations pushed their income up 2.5% to #27.6m.
Strong gains in the group's core public relations business were eroded
by reduced profits from a small portfolio of non-public relations
businesses such as advertising, printing and design.
As a result, overall profits in the UK slipped by #300,000 to #4.7m.

<HEADLINE>Boyd sues club for #50,000 cut of fee</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>10</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980189317</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
CELTIC and Scotland star Tom Boyd claims he is still owed #50,000 by
Motherwell following his #750,000 transfer to Chelsea in 1991.
Boyd, 29, who captained 'Well to the Scottish Cup that year, is suing
the Lanarkshire club at the Court of Session for the money, which he
says was supposed to help him buy a house in London.
His agent, Dennis Roache, told Lord Cameron of Lochbroom yesterday
that Motherwell offered Boyd #50,000 if he signed for another club
before his contract ran out on June 30, 1991.
Mr Roache did not think this was enough and eventually, when the
transfer to Chelsea was all but dead, Motherwell chairman John Chapman
offered #75,000 which Boyd accepted.
Mr Roache said that this was paid, but Motherwell reneged on a deal
with Chelsea to pay Boyd a further #50,000 cut of the total transfer
fee.
Boyd had been earning #150 per week plus bonuses with Motherwell, but
Mr Roache negotiated a five-year deal with Chelsea worth a total of
#750,000.
Under English league rules the #300,000 signing-on fee for Boyd had to
be paid in #60,000 instalments, one at the start of each year of his
five-year contract.
The remainder was to be paid as a #90,000-a-year salary but #10,000 a
year of that was sacrificed by Boyd, who now lives in Bothwell, so that
he could have more money to help him move to London.
According to Mr Roache, this money, totalling #50,000, was to be paid
by Chelsea to Motherwell as part of the transfer fee then passed on by
Motherwell to Boyd after deducting tax and national insurance.
Mr Roache explained that Motherwell wanted Boyd to be transferred
before the end of the season because the club stood to gain much more by
transferring him while he was still under contract.
A letter from Mr Chapman to Chelsea managing director Colin Hutchison
was read which stated that the #75,000 which Boyd did receive was made
up of the #50,000 from Chelsea plus #25,000 from Motherwell.
Cross-examined by advocate Stephen Woolman, for Motherwell, Mr Roache
said he was not aware that Chelsea had offered #800,000 for Boyd before
the meeting at which Boyd was offered money by Motherwell to leave.
Mr Woolman suggested that what Motherwell had in fact been offering
was #50,000 out of that #800,000, but that in the end that did not apply
because Boyd was sold for only #750,000.
Tom Boyd told the hearing that he wanted to stay as long as his team
was still in the Scottish Cup.
He eventually travelled to London to complete his signing for Chelsea
a few days after the Scottish Cup final on May 18, 1991, in which
Motherwell defeated Dundee United 4-3.
Questioned by Mr Woolman, Boyd denied that the offer of #50,000 from
Motherwell to leave applied only if he left before March 29, at which
time both Nottingham Forest and Chelsea were interested.
''I did not think there was ever a deadline on that offer, the only
deadline was June 30, the end of my contract,'' he told the court.
Motherwell's position is that there was a deadline of March 29, 1991,
on the #50,000 offer to Boyd. The offer was to be withdrawn if he had
not signed for either Nottingham Forest or Chelsea by that date, which
he did not.
The hearing continues.

Tokyo, Tuesday -- Stocks closed firmer on a technical rebound after
yesterday's plunge, brokers said. Stock indices were also supported by
firmness in construction shares.
However, many market participants lacked confidence about the
short-term direction of stock prices, they said.
''It is too early to say that share prices have bottomed out. Today's
gains were due to a technical rebound and we must wait to see the market
conditions for one or two more days,'' said Toshiyuki Nishiguchi,
general manager at Daiwa Securities.
The Nikkei closed up 275.24 at 18,060.73 after shedding 1054.73
yesterday. The Nikkei closed firmer only for the third time this year.
The broader TOPIX index was up 19.62 at 1410.30. The Nikkei 300 ended up
3.77 at 258.57.
Many construction companies posted substantial gains in heavy trade on
hopes of more orders after the earthquake which ravaged central Japan
last week, brokers said.
Purchases were mainly by dealers, but individual and institutional
investors were also seen buying construction firms' shares, they said.
Among the top 10 heavily traded shares in Tokyo today, five were
construction firms.
* Hong Kong -- Shares ended the day up modestly in see-saw trading.
The blue chip Hang Seng Index closed at 7022.90, up 54.94.
Trading was light with turnover of HK$2820m, compared with yesterday's
HK$3190m.

Sizeable write-offs will be needed at the US plastics side serving the

THE Mexican financial crisis and a major shake-out in Far Eastern
equity markets have taken a heavy toll on the Glasgow-based Murray
Smaller Markets Trust.
Reporting a 3.2% decline in net asset value during the half-year to
November 30, the investment trust revealed there had been a further 12%
decline in shareholders' equity to #230m since the halfway stage.
During the six months to November, net asset value per share fell from
478.9p to 463.8p, although this 3.2% decline was better than a fall of
4.2% on the World Index.
However, total return on net assets fell 2.8%, poorer than the World
Index drop of 0.2%. A 10% increase took the interim dividend to 1.56p.
The extent of the sell-off in the Mexican market is reflected in the
fact that Murray Smaller Markets' exposure has been reduced from 9.9% to
5% since the end of November, merely as a result of plummeting share
prices.
At the halfway stage, the investment trust had 40% of its funds in the
Far East, with 26% in Europe and 17% in Latin America. Recent political
disruption in Europe has further depressed performance.
However, Rodger Scullion, who has managed the trust for 12 years,
believes economic fundamentals in the likes of Argentina, Chile,
Singapore, Indonesia and Hong Kong remain sound and that, after recent
plunges, their equity markets offer even better value.
By sitting tight, the investment trust hopes to reap the benefits of a
sea change in sentiment towards currently trouble-torn smaller markets.
Murray Smaller Markets has a first-class record of producing
above-average capital growth for shareholders, who have every reason to
retain confidence in the fund managers.

WITH the City's attention still firmly focused on the pharmaceuticals
sector in the wake of Glaxo's #9000m bid for Wellcome on Monday,
Zeneca's trading report published yesterday was keenly awaited.
In the event it held no surprises for the City with the company
expecting its trading performance in 1994 to be close to market
expectations.
However, the shares dropped 30p to 886p after a strong run-up in the
wake of the Glaxo/Wellcome bid news. Prior to Glaxo's bid Zeneca shares
were among the most popular in the sector with City analysts.
Zeneca is thought more likely to assume the role of predator rather
than prey in any bid situation, with Fisons often mentioned as a
possible target.
In its trading statement there was talk of improved sales in Zeneca's
pharmaceuticals division despite deteriorating market conditions,
particularly in the US and Italy where government healthcare reforms
have cut drug company margins. The division's profits are expected to
show a similar growth rate to the 7% reported in the first half of 1994.
Newer drugs such as Zoladex maintained strong growth. Zeneca already
has leading positions in its market sectors and its product portfolio
boasts a long list of world leaders. For example, Nolvadex is the
world's largest selling anti-cancer medicine. Zeneca has recently begun
patent infringement proceedings, under its US patent for Nolvadex,
against the Canadian generic drug company, Novopharm limited.
Elsewhere in the group, the agrochemicals business is expected to show
an improved performance on 1993. However, drought in Australia and South
Africa and the withdrawal of the seeds business from East Europe
adversely affected sales in the second half. The division is one of the
world's top three largest suppliers of crop protection products.
Profit growth for the year is expected to be comparable with the
pre-exceptional 46% reported at the half-year. At the end of December,
the garden products business was sold to Miracle Garden Care for #37m.
The disposal and resulting exceptional profit on sale will be included
in the 1994 results.
Michael Pragnell, currently an executive director of Courtaulds, will
be joining Zeneca as chief executive officer of Zeneca Agrochemicals and
Seeds with effect from April 1, 1995.
The specialties portfolio includes Quorn, the myco-protein foodstuff
invented by Zeneca which is high in protein and fibre but low in fat.
Its sales were strong in the year but overall the division's annual
sales growth is expected to be below the 5% reported at the interim
stage. Despite turbulence in some markets, the division's profits are
expected to show continued improvement in the second half.
On the financial side, the company's net exceptional item for the full
year is expected to be around the #100m charge announced with the
interim results. Zeneca is due to publish its full-year trading results
on March 2, 1995.
Yesterday, Glaxo shares bounced back after City analysis of the huge
potential cost savings, possibly more than #500m, arising from a merger
with Wellcome. Glaxo shares gained 9p to 608p, while Wellcome lost 6p to
955p.

Joining them in the 20-team draw will be rival university teams Oxford

BABCOCK International has won a $200m (#125m) contract to supply four
coal-fired boilers to two power stations in North-east China, which will
ensure employment for the 700 workers at the Renfrew manufacturing plant
and for the 400 designers and engineers at Crawley for the next two
years.
This base load is the precursor to at least one similarly-sized
contract which should be announced in the next month.
The letter of award has been signed between Babcock, Westinghouse
International and Sargant &amp; Lundy, both of the US, and Huaneng Power
International for the design and construction of the two 700mw stations
in the Liaoning Province at Dandong and Dalian.
The total value is some $600m. Full details will be announced after
the formal signing next month.
Duncan Fox, managing director of Babcock Energy, said that ''we are
delighted at securing this new business which underlines the strength of
our technology and international competitiveness.''
Babcock is currently bidding for a lot of work in China, a company
spokesman said. The restructuring of the last two years means that
Babcock can now win against the best in the world.
In the last 2[1/2] years, the Renfrew workforce has fallen from around
2400 employees as the company grappled to come to grips with costs as
part of its survival strategy. That included a complete management
reshuffle and a #79m rights issue.
Babcock's negotiating position has been helped by the $2000m credits
advanced to China by the British Government, where one of the
stipulations is that component manufacturing should take place in the
United Kingdom.
The company has formed a joint venture with Wuhan Boiler Works which
won its first order last May. But in that case, only Crawley is
contributing significantly through design expertise with manufacturing
taking place in China.
* Gallaher yesterday slapped a ''for sale'' sign on its 700 Forbuoys
outlets and the Prestige housewares business.
The sell-offs will leave Gallaher with brands like Benson &amp; Hedges,
Silk Cut, Hamlet and Old Holborn, plus Whyte &amp; Mackay whisky and
Vladivar vodka.

IN the curency markets the Spanish peseta and Italain lira continued
to be affected by political concerns.
The Spanish Prime Minister's decision not to seek re-election was seen
as increasing the likelihood of an early Spanish general election.
This unsettled the peseta with the Bank of Spain rumoured to be
intervening to support the currency. However, the prospect of Italian
Prime Minister Dini winning a confidence vote today in Parliament
boosted the lira.
Elsewhere, the Mexican peso slipped back against the US dollar ahead
of the expiration later this week of $1000m of Mexican bonds. The bonds
are at the centre of Mexico's financial crisis because of concerns that
the country may not be able to pay them.
Among the major currencies the dollar hovered in a narrow band with
attention focused on the fate of the US's $40bn aid package to Mexico
and the forthcoming FOMC meeting at which another rise may be sanctioned
in US interest rates.
Sterling was slightly ahead of the dollar at $1.5958 but it was almost
half-a-pfennig better than the German mark at DM2.4147. Its
trade-weighted index rose by 0.1 to 80.2.

John Macleod is right; in the British context Labour has nothing to
gain and everything to lose by again punting devolution (January 17).
The reduction in Scottish representation at Westminster which must
surely follow a devolved Scottish parliament will ensure a perpetual
Tory majority in England.
So why doesn't Tony Blair do Scotland, his English colleagues, and
himself a favour by drying up about devolution and leaving the struggle
for Scottish self-determination to the genuine nationalists in the SNP?
The leader of that party has not the slightest interest in obtaining
the keys to a rather drab-looking terraced house in a foreign capital.

CREDITORS of a company whose owner was charged with stealing police
funds should receive 60p in the pound if a planned deal goes ahead.
The assets of Tomintoul Enterprises Ltd (TEL) were frozen by the
Metropolitan Police, leaving creditors owed more than #200,000.
The company was owned by the self-styled laird of Tomintoul, Mr
Anthony Williams, a 56-year-old Metropolitan Police accountant.
In August he was charged with stealing #30,000 from police funds,
following an investigation into the disappearance of an estimated #4m.
He is currently released on #50,000 bail.
That month an injunction was granted to the Metropolitan Police
Receiver on the basis that the company's assets might have been bought
with misappropriated funds. The injunction did not stop the company
carrying on its business.
Solicitors acting for Mr David Abdy, a director of the company, expect
that agreement can be reached with the 56 trade creditors within the
next few weeks. This would allow Mr Abdy and partners to take over the
assets and some of the liabilities of TEL.
The assets are the Gordon Hotel, Clockhouse Restaurant, and a small
house.
Proposals put forward in November were rejected by the creditors but
the main ones indicated informally that they would be prepared to accept
amended proposals.
Yesterday, a spokesman for the Aberdeen solicitors, Peterkins, said he
expected everything to be concluded by the middle of next month.
''We are on the final leg,'' he said. ''Well over 90% of the creditors
have agreed and I would be surprised if it was rejected.''
Peterkins has reached agreement in principle with solicitors for the
receiver to release the injunction and discharge claims against TEL, in
return for #275,000 from the firm.
A new company, owned by Mr Abdy, his management team and others, would
take over TEL's undertakings.
Conditional agreement has been reached with the National Westminster
Bank for a funding package.
The funding will not be enough to satisfy all the creditors so it is
proposed the new company will acquire the assets and undertakings for
#425,000, of which #325,000 will be payable initially.
Of that, #275,000 will go to the receiver and from the remaining
#50,000 the creditors will receive an immediate dividend of 20p in the
pound. Creditors will convert 40% of their claims into secured stock of
the new company.

Glasgow For People (GFP) is very disturbed that Strathclyde Regional
Council should be incurring expenditure on the ''advertisement'' that
appeared in The Herald today with the style, format, and content
deliberately designed to appear to be news coverage rather than a
paid-for advertisement.
GFP assumes that the omission of the word ''advertisement'' at the top
of the copy was an error and that page 15 was a paid-for advertisement
accepted in terms of the normal arrangements for advertisers.

I read with interest Jim Thompson's letter on bank charges (January
17). When paying a credit card account, which I had left until later
than usual, I posted the cheque at the main post office in Stirling and
paid the surcharge to have the cheque delivered by a guaranteed date.
My next statement from the credit card company, run by one of
Scotland's major banks, included interest charges because the company
stated that the cheque had been received one day late.
The post office provided me with a receipt signed by the company
showing that the cheque had in fact been received on the due date. I
forwarded the receipt to the company and eventually the interest was
grudgingly refunded.
This is not the first time I have had to pay interest in similar
circumstances but it is the first time I have been in a position to
prove that my payment had arrived in time.

COMMISSION disclosure is the latest term to send shivers through the
financial services industry, yet hard-pressed housebuyers looking for a
good deal on mortgage interest rates don't seem to want to know.
Disclosure came into effect on January 1, and in simple terms, it
means that anyone who buys a life or pensions policy -- and this
includes homebuyers taking out an endowment mortgage -- now has to be
told exactly how much commission is being paid to the adviser.
It also means that insurance companies are now obliged to provide a
detailed 'key features' document, designed by the Securities and
Investments Board (SIB), for policies which are being recommended.
Consumer groups have fought for disclosure ever since the Financial
Services Act came into force in 1988. Insurance companies fought just as
vociferously against it, not least for the implementation costs
involved.
The crux of the consumer groups' argument was that if investors could
see exactly what they were getting, they would be encouraged to shop
around... and that competition resulting from disclosure, would lead to
cheaper policies.
Proof of the pudding will be in the eating, but many salespeople who
woke up on January 1 weak with trepidation, are so far finding it's very
much business as usual.
For those keen enough to grapple with reams of paper -- albeit printed
in the prescribed 'fair, clear and not misleading' manner -- disclosure
may prove to be quite an eye-opener.
Finding out how much commission is paid to an adviser is not, in
itself, a new phenomenon; independent financial advisers (IFAs) were
ahead of the game nearly three years ago, when this was one item of
'soft' disclosure given in percentage terms on product particulars at
the end of a transaction -- or in cash terms, if requested.
It's now mandatory up front, and must be disclosed in cash terms at
point of sale. This applies to all advisers, whether they are
independent, tied to acting for one insurance company or are part of a
direct sales force, and must be given in writing before a proposal form
is signed.
If the adviser is an IFA, the cash commission will be the amount paid
to the company, not the individual.
Other aspects of the 'key features' document which must also be given
at point of sale (on a generic basis until July 1, thereafter it must be
client-specific), expose the total costs of a policy (including the
insurance companies' own charges and expenses), all product particulars
and surrender values.
The latter have to be shown in cash terms, covering the first five
years of the policy. This is one area where investors can see at a
glance the companies which will pay back nothing after say, two years,
and those that will return a cash value.
The total costs of a policy will be given in monetary terms, assuming
a standard rate of investment growth. It will show how much will be
clawed back in charges over the policy term -- and will enable investors
to compare the costs of different insurance companies' plans.
This may all sound fairly straightforward, but really it's the tip of
the iceberg and the effect of 'own charges' will vary considerably.
Banks who have entered this market -- often known as bank assurers --
may have low charges on a product because their costs will be lost in
the overall expenses of their banking business.
Equally, a product may be new to the market, with no track record for
comparison. Small companies with lower overheads and lower charges will
not necessarily score highest on benefits -- the real motivating factor
at the end of the day.
John Malone, managing director of Mortgage Shops Ltd, commented:
''With all this additional information, the buying public will now
recognise the true value of an adviser who is totally independent and
free to research the investment market place and offer clients products
by choice... as opposed to chance.''
When SIB's plans for a disclosure regime were first announced last
April, chairman Andrew Large stated: ''Better disclosure is good news
for investors and, in spite of the cost of introduction, good for the
industry too because it will enhance investor confidence.''
Whether it does or not, remains to be seen, but for now the verdict
from numerous advisers seems to be that no one is particularly
interested.

January 23.
The SNP leadership must not presume to dismiss the views of the
party's supporters with the same calculated indifference and arrogance
with which it dismisses those of the party's activists and members.
The System Three poll on Scots' attitudes to the EU (January 19) shows
quite clearly that SNP voters are far from being supportive of the
party's policy on the EU, a fact which may already have been reflected
in the SNP's slide to 22% in the latest poll.
The rather ingenuous attempt by Messrs Salmond and Russell to rubbish
the System Three poll on the grounds that the questions were framed in a
British context smacks of desperation, particularly Mr Russell's claim
that ''in its detail, the poll indicates a strong support for Europe'',
when in fact the poll does precisely the opposite.
Only 47% of SNP supporters would vote to remain a member of the EU and
a substantial majority of the 53% of all those polled who stated a
preference to retain membership want to see an entirely different EU to
that which is being promoted by the SNP (and Labour and the Liberal
Democrats).
A total of 76% want to see the EU given no more power, with 48% who
think it has too much already.
Of those who voted to leave the EU, including the 33% of SNP
supporters, a total of 87% want the EU to have no more power, with 79%
of the opinion that it already has too much. Among those undecided about
EU membership, the figures are 60% and 44% respectively.
This requires some explanation from Mr Salmond, who has stated that
the transfer of power from national governments to EU institutions
represents a ''desirable objective''. It also requires an explanation
from SNP policy vice-convener Alex Neil, who gives unqualified support
to a single currency and the consequent control of the Scottish economy
by a European central bank.
As we approach 1996 and the IGC on Maastricht, those gentlemen may be
able to continue to run from the realities of SNP policy on the EU but
it is going to be increasingly difficult to hide.

THOUSANDS of us will be delighted to welcome the Scottish Boat,
Caravan, Camping and Leisure Show, the tenth in a series at the Scottish
Exhibition and Conference Centre and -- according to the organisers --
the best yet.
The SECC event, which runs from February 1 to February 5, is the
biggest display of boats, caravans, motorhomes, camping equipment -- and
a myriad of complementary products and services.
Hence the proliferation of what the organisers call ''come and try''
activities. These allow visitors to have a go at everything, from trying
out a range of fitness equipment to putting on pukka diving equipment
and getting an introduction to the fascinations of underwater life in
the show's own specially constructed pool. And no, the water isn't cold.
Perhaps it is the sheer scale of the Boat, Caravan, Camping and
Leisure Show that sets it apart. Special interests are catered for, but
not in any restrictive sense. Take a stroll around and you will find a
certain fascination in discovering how others enjoy themselves -- and it
is almost certain that you will emerge with a greater understanding of
what outdoor activity is all about, as well as a desire to broaden the
range of your own interests.
In recent years the caravanning section has been growing larger,
reflecting the upsurge in the numbers of people investing either in
tourers or larger static units which are used as family holiday homes.
Many of the leading manufacturers will be represented and as usual the
differences between this year's models and those of the not too distant
past will astonish many visitors.
For the ultimate in luxury, check out the new Cosalt twin units.
Created for owners who want the best of everything, they offer a huge
amount of space together with everything from dishwasher to microwave
oven.
Most of the advantages of the caravan apply to motorhomes, UK
ownership of which is growing even faster. The organisers have managed
to attract some of the most impressive vehicles from sources all over
the world.
Luxurious, enormously comfortable -- and a whole lot cheaper than
hotels, motorhomes originated in America. They are prized by families
who want to go wherever they want, whenever they want, without spending
hours kicking their heels in airport lounges.
True, the largest of them are expensive, often very expensive, but
modern design techniques mean that others are available for not much
more than the cost of a reasonable saloon car. The difference is that
they are more versatile and suffer far lower depreciation.
Hall 3 is where these kings of the road can be found -- they occupy
all of it. The best of the European and American models are there to be
examined, and if you want to try before you buy, information on how and
where to hire these vehicles is available.
Compare today's models with the one that started the trend in this
country, the ''old faithful'' 1962 Bedford CA Dormobile. The show
example is a usable classic and is one of the very first to be
manufactured in this country.
Camping too has undergone something of a metamorphosis in a single
generation. For many of us it was an activity belonging almost
exclusively to the military, Scout groups and serious mountaineers.
Little did we know that it would grow to the point where it would
provide alternative holiday accommodation on fully equipped holiday
sites in some of Europe's most beautiful locations -- at a fraction of
the cost of staying in hotels.
Scotland's largest camping specialist, Camping Ecosse, will be
exhibiting all that is new in tents and ancillary equipment, including
an ''instant on'' gas barbecue that takes the huff and puff out of
preparing alfresco family dinners.
Variety of attractions
THE seafaring side of the show accounts for around 40% of the total
space. There will be more than 50 craft with 60 different companies
showing everything from boats small enough to be carried on a car roof,
to large motor cruisers costing in excess of a #100,000.
If you already have your own vessel, the event provides an opportunity
to stock up on any chandlery, clothing or electronic equipment still
needed or -- and don't overlook this -- safety and insurance.
Entertainment is also a feature. The annual Sail Hoisting competition
organised by the Royal Yachting Association and Yachting Life Magazine
never fails to attract eager youngsters (and the odd veteran) eager to
display their expertise.
The 1994 winners, Toward Sailing Club, will be back to defend their
trophy and word has it they will take some beating.
Something entirely different will be the appearance of a full-sized
Sgoth, a traditional hand-built fishing boat from the Western Isles.
Older sailing enthusiasts may have heard their parents or grandparents
talking about the Sgoth, but the fact is that the last of them was built
in 1918.
Until now that is. The example at the SECC was created by John Murdo
MacLeod, 72 himself, and the grandson of the 1918 boat builder. Thanks
to John Murdo's unique skills a valuable part of Highland heritage has
been made available to future generations.
And if we have 50 boats, we just had to have a similar number of
caravans -- again from the budget-priced to the ultra luxurious.
Holidays in general? Yes, they are catered for at the Holiday
Pavilion, where visitors can choose from a range of activity (and
downright lazy) holidays based on the ''getting away from it all''
theme.
Naturally waterborne holidays are featured, courtesy of companies like
Sunsail Portsmouth, Europe's largest charter company, but there are
plenty of others based on terra firma for those who prefer something
more solid under their feet.
Add to this the all-encompassing leisure section, with everything from
outdoor clothing to leisureware on view, all jostling for attention with
such diverse products as mobile telephones, garden furniture and a host
of the latest labour- saving gadgets for home and holiday use.
The something-for-everyone tag has been misused so often over the
years that it has now become just another ad man's catchphrase, but it
really does apply to what's on offer at the Scottish Boat, Caravan,
Camping and Leisure Show.
Open from 11am until 9pm from Wednesday, February 1, to Saturday,
February 4, and from 11am until 9pm on Sunday, February 5, it is well
worth a visit.
Admission prices are #5 per adult, #3 for children between five and 16
years, senior citizens, UB40, disabled and students. Children under five
are admitted free and family tickets are available for #12. These cover
two adults and two children.
Something entirely different will be the appearance of a full-sized
Sgoth, a traditional hand-built fishing boat from the Western Isles.

IN one of the most challenging restoration projects ever carried out
in Glasgow, a complete ''Greek'' Thomson townhouse has been saved for
the nation. As well as ensuring that the architecture of Great Western
Terrace has been preserved in all of its imposing unity, the restoration
has also brought back to life one of the city's most exuberant and
unusual Victorian interiors.
Thanks to a partnership between Glasgow city council, developers
Classical House, Historic Scotland, and the some of the best craftsmen
north of the Border, a building which was riddled with rot and in a
state of collapse is now poised to become, once again, a truly
remarkable family home.
Yet it nearly did not happen. After many years of neglect, decay, and
use as a multi-occupancy dwelling, the building had got into such a
terrible state that the city council took the unusual step of issuing a
compulsory purchase order -- then looked around for the means to fund
the colossal costs of saving and then restoring the building.
It quickly became clear that the figures did not add up. The costs
were certain to be much higher than any selling price the building could
achieve. Chartered surveyors Miller Todd estimated that it would cost
#422,325 for remedial works -- a figure which did not include
decoration, bathroom and kitchen fittings, heating, light fittings, or
exterior stonework.
One of their first recommendations was that the massive first-floor
living room be propped up in case it suddenly became part of the
reception room below. The rest of the firm's report reads like a
housebuyer's nightmare.
''In general the dry rot infestation is so extensive and severe that
very few areas of the building will remain unaffected by eradication
works; this includes the roof coverings and all internal features and
finishes.''
The surveyors also issued a stark warning. ''If an early decision on
refurbishment of the building cannot be made, then the deterioration of
the building will continue, with an increasing threat to its structural
integrity.''
The city which had recently re-discovered Charles Rennie Mackintosh
was in danger of losing one of the most important residential buildings
by its other long-neglected architect, Alexander ''Greek'' Thomson.
The district council launched a competition to find a developer who
could save one of the city's most important architectural treasures. The
job went to Classical House, a Glasgow-based development firm which
specialises in restoring listed buildings which are at risk.
Their successes include the saving of Aitkenhead House in Kings Park,
Dalziel house in Motherwell, Dineiddwg House in Mugdock, and the Italian
Centre -- a stylish shopping, restaurant and residential development in
the Merchant City.
''The council's role in this restoration has been stunning,'' says
John Sheridan of Classical House. ''This could only have happened in
Glasgow. Building conservationists and organisations like Historic
Scotland are over the moon.''
Sheridan reckons that somewhere between #800,000 and #1m has been
poured into the restoration.
''The only way to do this job was with the aid of grants. There is no
way that a building like this could be saved and then sold at a
profit.'' A yawning money gap had to be bridged.
Great Western Terrace was built as a speculative venture in 1869 and
is the most impressive and powerful of a series of stately terraces
which were built along Great Western Road in the last century, all of
them outwith the city boundary at that time.
To break the long line of the buildings, many of Glasgow's terraces
were built with raised pavilions at each end and, if the building was
long enough, with a raised portion in the middle.
Thomson used a daring innovation, raising two sections of the terrace
a few doors in from each end, so that the lines of the terrace appear to
sweep effortlessly through the two pavilions. The result is that the
sheer length of the building does not become boring. The porches along
the frontage have Ionic columns, the only strongly Greek feature of the
terrace.
With all of its neighbours converted into smaller dwellings or nursing
homes, No.4 is the last complete townhouse in the imposing terrace, and
must be one of the finest of Thomson's interiors.
The house is entered through an Ionic portico which leads into a
vestibule with a tiled floor. But the real surprise of the house is a
few steps further on into the wide hall, beyond a another pair of Ionic
columns.
Suddenly you find yourself in the centre of a dramatic space - in the
middle of a large, square reception area with light pouring down from a
great circular cupola through a galleried upper hall. To heighten the
impression of grandeur, the upper hall is set back.
All round are doors (restored to their original natural timber
appearance) opening onto three large public rooms.
Breaking from the normal design tradition, Thomson did not place the
staircase in the hall: it is out of sight in an opening to the side. By
taking it out of the great central ''atrium'', Thomson creates further
drama at the head of the stairs by arranging a row of plaster columns
which act as a screen prior to the atrium being re-entered at gallery
level.
The gallery commands the centre of the house and the spatial effect,
heightened by the cast-iron railings and corner lights, is neo-Classical
and is used in an exciting and original way. Nothing that you see on the
outside of the terrace prepares you for the impact of the interior.
Surprises lie beyond the doors of the main apartments. To the left of
the entrance hall the drawing room has a magnificent timber ceiling with
stencilled decoration and a richly decorated fireplace. To the right, a
suite of two rooms of striking contrast, one classical white and bright,
the other Gothic.
The latter is very richly decorated and lit by stained glass windows
which tell the story of Sir Lancelot, each pane outlining an aspect of
love -- married love, unrequited love, forbidden love.
''This room is Victorian high Gothic: I've never seen anything quite
like it,'' says John Sheridan whose firm mounted a major piece of
detective work to track down door brasses and other artefacts which had
been stripped from the house and sold.
The character of this room is almost medieval, and the combined
quality of the carved stone gothic arch and fireplace, stencilled timber
ceiling skirtings and door, and enamelled inlaid brass ironmongery is
extremely ornate. This decoration is thought to be by Daniel Cottier, a
contemporary of Thomson responsible for other interiors in the West End
of Glasgow.
''In the 19th century the Gothic style and the Classical style
promoted by Thomson were opposing camps and to find this direct
juxtaposition in the same house is a paradox which adds to the unique
story of this property,'' says John Sheridan.
It is thought that a Cheltenham-based designer called Middleton also
had a hand in the interior design. He completed several schemes which
were very similar to No.4 Great Western Terrace, and a business card
with the name Middleton and a Cheltenham address was found during the
re-development of the building.
Restoring these rooms required the work of highly craftsmen, most of
whom were found in the Glasgow area.
A total of 45 pine church pews were converted into skirtings, panels
and other replacements for internal woodwork which had been damaged
beyond repair.
Some 11 tonnes of steel has been put into propping up the house. Some
70% of the stonework has been replaced, while the roof has been entirely
replaced.
When the house was put on the market, selling agent Colin Shaw of
Speirs Gumley was swamped with inquiries. Eventually the asking price of
#325,000 was exceeded by #25,000, while the separate basement property
achieved #150,000 on an asking price of #95,000.
The combined sale price of #475,000 comes nowhere near the real cost
of restoration, but a vital piece of heritage has been restored in time
for the City of Architecture &amp; Design celebrations in 1999.
Colin Shaw says: ''It was a pleasure to sell this building. Every
viewer was extremely enthusiasic, and the buyer is bowled over. As part
of the conditions of sale, most of the restoration work, interior
design, and artefacts are protected from removal, disposal or
alteration.
''The new owner has agreed to open the building to the public on
Glasgow's annual Open Doors day, and on other appropriate occasions. He
is, in effect, the custodian of an important building.''
The story of Sir Lancelot, told in the stained glass window, is a
vivid metaphor for the story of Great Western Terrace -- lovingly built
by a great architect and designer, his love was eventually unrequited by
the city.
But this story has a very happy ending...

SIR Clive Sinclair yesterday attempted to extol the advantages of his
latest invention which is designed to ''take the slog out of cycling''.
He visited the factory in Lanarkshire chosen to produce and distribute
his new Zeta machine (zero-emission transport accessory) which converts
ordinary bicycles from pedal power to electric power.
Sales of the device have reached 5000 since it went into production
last year at the Trilec sales and manufacturing factory in Blantyre.
Although almost 75% of the sales have been in the UK, Sir Clive is
confident the device will gain favour worldwide. Orders have already
been received from the US, Australia, Holland and India.
The shoe-boxed-sized machine has a retail price of #144.95. It
contains a battery-powered lightweight motor and can be fitted to the
back wheel of almost any bicycle.
Speeds of up to 14mph can be achieved. A single battery charge lasts
up to 10 miles.
Trilec, set up last year with assistance from Lanarkshire Development
Agency, fought off stiff competition from other firms to secure the Zeta
manufacturing contract.
Sir Clive said the company had provided the London-based Sinclair
Research with exactly the kind of high quality standards required to
compete in the worldwide market.
Tom Farrell, Trilec managing director, said the manufacturing contract
had been a ''real breakthrough'' for his company.
The firm now employs 23 people but hopes to double this within the
next 12 months.
Ian Livingstone, chairman of Lanarkshire Development Agency, described
the Zeta contract as a magnificent boost to an area which ''still faces
a formidable task in establishing a rejuvenated economy and creating a
new industrial future''.
He said Trilec's success demonstrated the calibre of the workforce in
Lanarkshire and the ability of smaller firms to supply high-quality
goods to large companies.
Sir Clive is optimistic about his latest venture. He said: ''We know
that the Zeta won't go the way of the C5 because we have had a very good
response.'' He said a modified version of the product had already been
introduced to address early criticisms.

LAST year was the most disastrous in history for aviation losses, with
claims totalling over $2200m (#1500m).
Although 22 western-built jets were totally destroyed -- in line with
the average for the last ten years -- and an increase from nine to 14 in
eastern-built aircraft, there has been a sharp rise in the value of each
aircraft lost.
The casualties include a new Air France Airbus 340 near Paris which
cost nearly #75m, while the satellite sector saw three misfires
amounting in all to almost #490m.
One consolation is that fatalities in western-built jets fell from the
720 average to 667. However, Institute of London Underwriters' chairman,
Len Campbell, warned that pressure on premiums is increasing with other
markets competing for London business.
He said the Kobe earthquake will have a serious effect on the
international cargo insurance market as it is a major transit port as
well as being one of the largest Japanese industrial cities.
There is little direct outside insurance cover provided to Japanese
assets such as houses, industrial activities and loss of profits because
of both bureaucratic interference and a restriction that only 15% of
damage can be covered by earthquake insurance. However, there is a
considerable sum at risk for exporters.
The insurance company-financed ILU which handles just over half the
international insurance transacted in London has no idea as to what
these claims could be arising from damage to cargo from collapsed
warehouses, defrosting because of power interruptions and other losses,
including delays.

ELECTRICITY is at the heart of the modern home, to provide the comfort
of warmth in winter, to power the lamps and lights which give atmosphere
to home decor schemes and to bring to life the host of appliances which
act as housemaids, washing our clothes and dishes, preparing and cooking
our food and giving us television, video, and computer games at the
flick of a switch.
Specialist professional electrical companies provide expert services
ensuring that the electrical supply to your home is safe, efficient and
economical, and if you have any doubts about the safety of your power
supply or appliances, call in a qualified professional. Some background
information on supply, tariffs and saving energy can help you make the
most of the power in your home.
Electricity enters your house through the heavy supply wires of the
electricity board, and once inside the house it passes through your fuse
box or circuit-breaker panel and is distributed through separate runs of
wiring called circuits. Each circuit is rated for the strength of
electrical load it can carry.
Circuit breakers and fuses safeguard your electrical system against
overloads that are put on the wiring if you try to draw more electricity
through the wiring than it can safely carry. They also protect against
fire hazard from flaws within appliances or frayed wires in the house
wiring system that could cause short circuits. Circuit breakers are
switches that trip to ''off' if the ciruit is overloaded. To reset, you
simply have to press a little button -- after you have identified and
repaired or remedied the cause of the overload.
There are some basic safety points which should always be borne in
mind. Always switch off at the mains before starting a repair job. Never
poke a finger, or scissors, or anything else, into a light-bulb socket
or wall socket. Never connect an electric appliance or gadget to water,
as you risk electrocution. Don't even hold a plugged-in appliance with
wet hands, or if you have wet feet, or when you are standing in the bath
or have your feet in a bowl of water. Don't touch a switch with wet
hands, and never use water to put out an electrical fire in an appliance
that is plugged in. Unplug it, then use a chemical fire extinguisher.
Home safety experts reckon that every home should have one that
conforms to British Safety Standards, but if you have an electrical fire
and no suitable extinguisher, then it might be practicable to smother
flames with a coat or blanket, and call the fire brigade.
If you have a 13-amp circuit, you will rarely blow a fuse in the fuse
box, but the fuse within each plug will give out occasionally. Bearing
in mind all that has been said about safety, if you can thread a needle,
you can mend a fuse. A fuse is a deliberately weak link, inserted into
an electrical system to prevent it from being overloaded. A fuse blows
quite easily, because the wire through wich the current passes won't
carry a strong load, and so it melts if overloaded with too many
appliances. If a fuse blows with a bang, usually there's a fault in one
of the appliances, which is likely to need specialist attention.
When several lights go out, chances are a fuse has blown in the fuse
box, as the cable of wall lights and other lights which don't have plugs
go back to the fuse box, so that if one blows, every other light on the
circuit will also go out.
Remember to keep a torch, fuse wire and a small screwdriver close to
the fuse box. Switch off the mains current. Pull out and replace each
fuse one by one, until you see which one has a broken, blackened and
melted piece of wire in the middle.
Homes with new wiring have cartridge fuses instead of wire. Its just a
case of thowing out the old one, and putting in a new one of the same
colour.
If you suspect that a fuse has blown because you have overloaded the
circuit by having too many appliances plugged into one socket, then
unplug everything running off this outlet before you start mending the
fuse, and don't immediately overload it again.
If you suspect a faulty appliance, then turn off all appliances, mend
the fuse, and turn the appliances on again one by one. When the fuse
blows again, you've found the culprit. Unplug it and mend the fuse
again, and get an expert to deal with the faulty appliance, which may
have a short circuit in its internal wiring. This is a job for an
electrician.
Also, remember that electricity increases fire risks, and check that
fires, electric blankets and cookers are switched off when not in use.
How to
cut fuel
bills
YOU can save energy and chop your fuel bills by checking that you are
on the correct energy tariff -- if in doubt, ask at your local gas or
electricity showroom.
Make sure that the hot water cylinder has a snug, four-inch thick
jacket, which will promptly pay for itself, use a shower rather than a
bath and you will halve hot water bills, and defrost your refrigerator
regularly to prevent thick ice build up.
Set the central heating time clock to give heat only when it is
needed, and consider replacing old, inefficient or broken appliances
with efficient new ones which use less fuel to give the same heat.

ONE of the grand old names of British manufacturing industry, Albright
&amp; Wilson, should receive a warm welcome from long-term investors next
month when it is sold off by its Tenneco parent for around #600m through
a Stock Exchange offer for sale.
The pathfinder prospectus shows that in the year to December 25, it
achieved an estimated operating profit of #62.7m on turnover of #642m --
almost reaching chief executive Robin Paul's target of a 10% margin.
However, pre-tax profits have been hit by some #16.6m of
rationalisation costs and a #3.8m provision due to the devaluation of
the Mexican peso.
However, Mr Paul believes that could be to the advantage of the joint
venture with Troy Grupo to produce purified wet phosphoric acid in that
country for export markets.
Albright, which was founded in 1851 at Oldbury in the West Midlands,
produces about half the world's phosphoric acid for the drinks and food
industries and a significant proportion of surfactants for shampoos and
the like.
With customers like Unilever, Colgate and Procter &amp; Gamble, it is a
near certainty that every British household uses Albright products.
It is successfully passing on increased prices to customers and
current year profitability should benefit from the past rationalisation.
Although it is lightly geared with debt of just #39m against net
assets of #327m, Albright will not be an aggressive acquirer of other
companies.
Mr Paul is very much a product of Tenneco's style of management by
forecast and believes in short-term, one-year rolling contracts for
directors.
The public is being offered up to 15% of the equity. Lists close on
February 24 and dealings are expected to begin on March 8.

I had to report a minor telephone fault to British Telecom by dialling
151. I was greeted by a recorded announcement which told me that I was
on a call-queueing system. The announcement was repeated five times
before a real human being answered. I don't remember waiting so long
with the old manual system.
More out of curiosity than anything else, I asked the geographical
location of the voice. The answer was Lincoln!
I don't doubt that the world of technology can produce wondrous things
but I have grave reservations about the wisdom of allowing such
centralised folly. Am I alone in feeling that the dulcet tones of a
local accent are both reassuring and give the impression that my
telephone is cared about by someone in the immediate vicinity?
My nationalism is once again fired up by this apparent triviality. I
hope managers in charge of large organisations everywhere will begin to
realise that they are becoming increasingly divorced from the very
people they claim to serve by continually seeking ridiculous ways to
save money.

I can sympathise with Mr Gibson regarding his efforts to contact BT
(January 18). I have had a similar experience trying to secure a
direct-pay form from Scottish Gas. I was thankful I was not trying to
report a gas leak.
It seems to me that it will not be long before services and
institutions close most of their local offices and business will be done
by telephone, or other electronic facilities, and perhaps not even
addressed to an office in Scotland.
There is also the continuing reduction in staff. Apart from some lone
voices who have expressed their concern via your pages, the consequences
of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs seem to be ignored, in
particular by both Government and trade unions.

It is with a sense of horror heightened by local knowledge that I
watched the pictures of devastation following the earthquake in Japan.
Last November Junior Chamber Scotland sent a large delegation to the
World Congress of Junior Chamber International held in Kobe. More than
30 of that delegation were from Glasgow Junior Chamber of Commerce,
which will be hosting the world congress in November this year.
While in Kobe we had ample opportunity to enjoy Japanese hospitality,
indeed most of our members spent at least one evening in the very homes
so recently destroyed.
In circumstances such as these there is a genuine feeling of shared
suffering even though the disaster is on the other side of the world.
Junior Chamber International has already established a Kobe Relief
Fund and I believe Scotland's support of this helps give substance to
the Junior Chamber movement's major international theme of ''Global
Citizenship''.

I smiled when I read Anvar Khan's article describing her experience of
being fawned on by shop assistants when she was expensively dressed and
ignored when she looked scruffy (January 19).
I have known about this for many years and have turned it to my
advantage. I prefer to shop in peace, without the concerned,
overhelpful, and (unavoidably) self-interested audience one acquires if
one looks affluent. So long as one doesn't appear actually criminal,
being scruffy serves the purpose very well.
If one finally decides, unpestered, to buy something, the production
of a charge or credit card is wonderfully reassuring to staff. And
shopping scruffily (I always hope) leaves one slightly less liable to
get one's bag snatched.

Margaret Vaughan's article, What a tangle of quangos (January 18),
exposes a bitterness in Scottish society against those who serve, a
dangerous rift between the ''dos'' and the ''do nots''.
The constant flow of vitriol from George Robertson and colleagues
against ''the many unnamed people'' who serve the public sector in a
part-time and most diligent capacity has to be countered.
It is indeed the case that Mr Robertson was himself content to serve,
paid, on two of Scotland's leading quangos, the SDA and STB, prior to
being elected to Parliament. He also served as a governor of the police
college.
Most of those who today serve on public bodies do so out of a sense of
duty, a sense of community spirit, and get more satisfaction out of
investing back into society a portion of their wisdom and experience
than they do out of any pay packet, which is taxed and well below the
commercial rate for the job or experience given.
A substantial portion of the duties delivered, on behalf of society,
through these non-executive positions is unpaid, like local enterprise
companies and educational boards.
Those who serve are accountable. They are accountable in law. They are
accountable to the bodies they serve and their staffs. They are
accountable to the Minister and to Parliament. They are accountable to
the people they serve through the Citizen's Charter.
They are on short-term contracts. Many of these bodies' chief
executives, a professional appointment, in the public service, are
directly accountable to the public accounts committee. All these bodies
are subject to audit and strict codes of conduct.
Of course Mr Robertson and the Labour Party know all this. They
invented the quango, and many of their legions have served in the past
but choose not to serve now, despite invitation to do so.
It is indisputable that the number of quangos has been reduced.
We can only welcome the cost-benefit analysis the Labour Party might
conduct. As to the suggestion that the cost of the non-executive
servants to the public cause might pay for the expense of a Scottish
parliament -- it is a load of bunkum!
The Labour Party's sour-grapes policy and witch hunt against those who
serve by invitation, and voluntarily, will do nothing but create a
vacuum in public service accountability and management.
One does not require much imagination as to how they might fill it.
This is blatant discrimination against those who serve and a call for
sectarian policy, and a false argument in pursuit of a false cause.

LIKE many women at some stage of life, Peaches Finkel was searching
for a husband. She had found three at separate intervals over a period
of 25 years but all had been cast adrift at some time by her
over-enthusiasm for divorce. But at the age of 47 she was pursuing
wedding bells again from a deeply held conviction that any marriage must
always be better than no marriage, and lots of marriages should surely
be better than some.
So in a letter from her home in Pasadena she told her friends that a
zesty dude called Lee was now installed over the threshold, telling her
she was his sweetie, his one and only. Yet no sooner had they tied the
knot than the police arrived to inform Peaches that Lee was a serial
bigamist, an eternal bridegroom whose sense of truth was continually
usurped by fiction.
Peaches' questing seems to confirm the notion that marriage still
sends a remarkable number of people potty. Not long ago Giovanni
Vigliotto pleaded insanity -- and probably not before time -- when he
was arrested in America for marrying, in different parts of the country,
100 or so wives. But in his shrewdly batty way, Vigliotto insisted that
each of the women knew precisely what she was doing when she took his
name, or rather one of his 52 aliases. However, one ''spouse'' contested
that assertion. A wife of scarcely more than honeymoon duration, she
claimed Vigliotto had ingratiated himself into her affections only to
make off with her entire savings of $36,000.
Of course the possession of charm when in pursuit of money has always
been a vital component in the con person's portmanteau. A hundred years
ago in Paris, Evelyn Leal, a pretty woman whose sparkling dark eyes
afforded a delicious contrast to the pale delicacy of her skin, was
sentenced to six months' imprisonment for behaving like a bounder. In
short, she had led several men, on separate occasions, halfway to the
altar, each of them smitten by her entrancing nature and the belief that
here was a widow with a dowry of close on #100,000.
Alas that sum existed nowhere but in Mme Leal's imagination, but as
she had advertised such financial security in several Parisian
newspapers she was taken before the 11th Chamber of the Police Court to
face charges of deception, accusations brought against her by outraged
gentlemen, one of whom ungallantly disclosed that their little romance
had cost him #20,000.
Still, in Vigliotto's case you cannot help feeling that there was a
reason other than greed and digging for gold. Here was a man, his
defence lawyer insisted, who was in love not just with women but with
matrimony itself. What this evangelical view of lovemaking ignores,
however, is that many such men are bewitched by a furtive thrill called
infidelity. For them it is the clandestine nature of betrayal which is
the spur to further conquests.
But, as Peaches can testify, you do not have to be a bigamist to be a
marriage collector. Despite the reality that one in four Scottish
marriages now ends irrevocably in pieces, ours remains a married
society, although its marital structure is far more complex than ever
before. Remarriage in this country is rapidly assuming American
dimensions. In fact Britain today has the highest rate of remarriage in
the European Union, all of which suggests that whatever the wretchedness
of divorce, those who have been scarred are still very much convinced
that marriage has a future.
And the multi-married are not always parodies of commitment and
devotion. Their relationships may fall to bits for profoundly different
reasons: a tumult of insecurities; the restless need for perfection;
retarded emotional development; or that peevish search for a parent in a
lover. In such circumstances anything less than marriage might seem
sensible, yet it is precisely because of such circumstances that
anything less than marriage represents defeat.
But in certain circles the wedding has become such a movable feast the
bride and bridegroom, anticipating divorce may follow in short order,
now arrive for the nuptial ceremony each carrying a simple bouquet of
pre-marriage contracts. Not that this has done anything to kill off
top-of-the-wedding-cake fashion. In fact, bridal is one of the few
sectors of the garment industry doing well in Britain today. There,
upwards of #500 will probably be set aside by the bride's family for a
virginal crinoline in satin and lace.
The reason is that no other garment asserts a woman's moment of fame
more proudly than her traditional wedding threads, and so it has been
since the rag trade of antiquity ran up those little gossamer betrothal
shifts for Egyptian maidens.
In Paris, one of the couture salons recently unveiled ''the most
expensive bridal gown in the world''; a creation embroidered with 723
diamonds at a cost of around #4m. Featuring mutton-chop sleeves, a
bouffant skirt, and an almost aisle-length train, the dress's most
interesting accessory, however, was a clutch of bodyguards who looked
like the bull-necked hitmen of some dodgy Latin American dictator.
Even Peaches might have baulked at that wedding accompaniment.
Certainly these were not the kind of ushers you seek to subdue a new
mother-in-law's agitated feathers.

expertise in this highly specialised field. Purpose-built at a cost of
#3.5m, the home offers the very latest in sophisticated facilities for
the care of not only frail, elderly patients and those with dementia or
alcohol-related problems, but younger people with physical disabilities.
Campsie View is pleasantly situated in Canal Street in the heart of
Kirkintilloch, with a fine view of the hills from which it takes its
name. Local community facilities are readily available and the home is
handy for public transport, within easy reach of the M8 and also
conveniently close to Glasgow.
There are 90 single, en-suite rooms in the home, all furnished to a
high standard and designed for safety and comfort.
Remote-controlled televisions are provided in each room and residents
are encouraged to bring personal items such as pictures or small pieces
of furniture whenever possible, to make them feel more at home.
Accommodation is light and spacious and residents have a choice of seven
lounges throughout the building, some quiet, some with music or
television.
The circular plan of the two-storey building is one feature which aims
to cater for the sometimes unpredictable and erratic behaviour of
residents, while colour coding of doors assists in their orientation and
feeling of security. There is also a video entry system to the home and
a nurse call system throughout.
Bathrooms and toilets are similarly designed for safety and the home
has its own minibus transport with hydraulic hoist to ensure easy access
for wheelchairs. This means that extra mural outings of various sorts
can be enjoyed by the residents, e.g. visits to the theatre or concerts.
Of course hairdressing and chiropody services are provided in the home
itself, which also has its own laundry and shop, and a kitchen which
provides varied menus and caters for special diets.
Apart from the necessary 24-hour nursing care at Campsie View, there
is a highly stimulating programme of activities on offer in the home,
all designed to cater for the individual needs of the residents, and to
help sufferers from dementia and other disabilities to realise their
full potential.
So successful are these programmes that many Scotcare residents
blossom when they are admitted to the homes and enjoy a greatly improved
quality of life.
Reality orientation is one of the therapies practised by Scotcare, as
is reminiscence therapy. This latter involves using objects from the
past to bring out the wealth of memories locked inside each individual
and, says Scotcare's director of nursing, Gwen Kidd, residents whose
short-term memory may be extremely limited can prove to have astonishing
long-term recall when given the right stimulation.
Apart from the services of its two social and recreational therapists
(and physiotherapists) Campsie View offers a variety of hobbies, crafts
and games as well as a varied programme of film shows, concerts and
residents' clubs. A diversional therapist organises the various
activities according to individual needs and wishes, and residents'
committees are set up in the homes so that both residents and their
families can play an active part.
It may be however, that while some residents will be eager to join in
the various activities, others will prefer to sit quietly in their
rooms. The choice is theirs, but at all times it is the individual's
right to privacy, and dignity which is the main concern of all the staff
at Campsie View.
Visiting is open for family and friends, and potential long-term
residents are given the opportunity to have a four-week settling-in
period to enable them to assess the services on offer. It is not easy to
make the decision to seek long-term residential care for an elderly
relative, and many families feel extremely guilty and distressed when
they do finally seek help (often in difficult, stressful circumstances).
This settling-in period helps relatives come to terms with the situation
and they will also be given expert advice in coping with what can be a
traumatic experience.
The home, which is registered by the Greater Glasgow Health Board also
offers respite care and convalescence as well as continuing care, and
unit manager Tommy Docherty will be pleased to give confidential advice
on both nursing and financial matters (telephone: 041 777 8880)
Staff with wealth of
valuable expertise
SCOTCARE has become a significant employer in this country, with an
overall staff of 650 at its 11 homes. At Campsie View there are to be
around 100 staff, 75% of whom are full-time.
Not surprisingly in the current healthcare climate, a proportion of
the staff come from the health service and are bringing valuable NHS
expertise to an area of care which is increasingly provided by the
private sector.
Residents are privately or publicly funded according to individual
circumstances and assessment under the community care scheme but there
is definitely no two-tier system in the home and no discrimination.
This, says Dr Ishak-Hannah who is Scotcare's chief executive, is because
the only person who knows where the funding comes from is the unit
manager.
In the case of Campsie View this is Tommy Docherty, RGN, RMN who
worked for many years for the NHS but who also has nursing home
experience as a manager in the private sector. He leads a team of
qualified nurses, trained carers and ancillary staff.
Staff training and development is receiving a high profile at Campsie
View as at other Scotcare homes, and the company believes that this
sound investment in staff is necessary to achieve the high-quality care
and service which their philosophy demands.
Scotcare has also been awarded the prestigious BS5750 quality
certification (now ISO 9001 1994). This means that residents and their
relatives at Campsie View can be assured of a guaranteed minimum
standard of care and service.
There used to be a certain stigma attached to putting one's relation
whether it be husband or wife, father or mother or a more distant
relative into a home. However Dr Ishak-Hannah, (who is a recognised
specialist in brain and spinal injuries), feels that people are becoming
more realistic about the need for long-term care.
''You have to stand back and ask yourself who is best to care for this
person, and do you need professional help.'' Dr Ishak-Hannah set up
Scotcare 10 years ago at the start of the private health revolution when
many people were hoping to make a fortune out of ''granny-farming''.
Unlike many of the nursing homes which sprang up in idiosyncratic old
buildings though, Scotcare provides specialist services, and the sort of
sophisticated nursing support which is now demanded both by customers
and regulators.
Now, it is part of the UK's third biggest private nursing homes group
and in the year to March 1994 the company recorded a profit of #2.29m on
a turnover of #8.78m. Hence the huge investment in the new home in
Kirkintilloch.
''But,'' says Dr Ishak-Hannah, ''I make no secret of my philosophy.
My number one priority is to provide excellent care for our residents,
my second priority is to my staff and my third priority is to our
shareholders.''

THE danger of working up a lather of middle-aged indignation is great.
Those who may have exercised themselves most fully in their youth by
carrying a pile of Rolling Stones records (vinyl, to the very young) are
not best placed to criticise their indolent children. The issue of
eating up your greens, if dealt with honestly, can be even more
embarrassing. Nevertheless there is some lathering to be done. The
survey of the health-related behaviour of secondary children within
Glasgow carried out by the Greater Glasgow Health Board is timely and
informative. It comes at a period when knowledge about how to live
healthily is available to the public as never before. Despite this, any
concerned parent could have sat down with pen and paper and come up with
a list of the troubling areas relating to young people's health which
would correlate closely with the health board's data. Activities in the
home are a case in point. Watching television takes up a
disproportionate amount of young people's time. That this is sedentary
is bad enough, but the programmes available to youngsters can seem
predominantly transatlantic and are therefore badly placed to correspond
to the reality of life in Scotland. The French enjoy complaining about
American cultural imperialism transmitted through television and film
and, although this is no part of the health board's study, the issue of
what is included in that significant proportion of young people's
leisure time should not be forgotten. It may even tie in with the
discovery that a majority of youngsters do not feel safe going out after
dark.
The role of parents is dealt with scantily in a report which is
primarily intended for education and health-care specialists.
Nevertheless, every issue -- from exercise, through food, to smoking,
drinking alcohol, and information about sex and Aids -- is an area in
which parents can and should be involved. It is distressing to find that
a majority of children learn about sex from friends while believing that
their parents and school lessons should be the main source of
information. The diet of children is another area in which parents
should be able to exercise an influence, if only they will. Too many
children appear to breakfast inadequately or wrongly, if they breakfast
at all. With acute perception the report points out that the diet of
schoolchildren, and their ability to change what they eat, is restricted
by their limited purchasing power. Yet children in many areas of Glasgow
are given money to feed themselves as often as they are given good food.
It is hardly surprising that this should lead to a preponderance of
sugary and fatty foods in their diet. It might be expected that
middle-class parents would encourage better eating habits in their
children. This may be the case, but only up to a point. The prosperity
of middle-class families, with all that means for affordability of good
food and better social and housing conditions, is also an element in the
health equation.
Those who point out that an ageing population will soon be a
significant drain on society are often accused of being unnecessarily
harsh and unfair. It is an inexorable fact that an unhealthy younger
population will also be a significant drain on the future health
resources of society. Because of this it is reasonable to expect
teachers, as well as health-care promoters, to take an important role in
educating children in personal health care and, perhaps as importantly,
in parenting. Parents must also be involved if they can but, crucially,
it is evident that youngsters who feel an element of control of their
own health, as opposed to those who feel controlled by external sources,
can have better overall health. To educate and inform youngsters on
health issues is to empower them, and an empowered youngster will make a
better job of looking after his or her health.

HOMEOWNERS in St Andrews are teeing themselves up for a windfall in
their bank accounts this summer. The 124th Open Golf Championship will
take place in world's capital of golf from the 20th to the 23rd of July,
and as the golfers and their fans fly in, the locals will flood out.
Accommodation in the Fife town will be at a premium, and the locals are
set to cash by charging up to three times the normal summer holiday
letting rate.
Every golfer's dream -- apart from playing a round of golf at the
Royal and Ancient -- would be to rent accommodation overlooking the
course. However, at this stage it's about as likely as getting a hole in
one when the wind is howling off the North Sea into your face.
Although the Open only lasts for four days, it is almost impossible to
book accommodation for such a short period. Those wanting self-catering
accommodation can book a minimum of ten days through agents Pagan
Osborne Grace &amp; Calders or a minimum of two weeks from July 15 to July
29 through Eve Brown Property Managers. The majority of hotels have been
fully booked for some time.
Pagan Osborne Grace &amp; Calders are the official agents to The Open.
They have been busy taking accommodation bookings and their remit is to
provide ten days accommodation within a 10-mile radius of St Andrews.
Prices range upwards from #500 for a one-bedroom apartment.
Letting agents in St Andrews maintain their own lists of regular Open
clients. A representative of Pagan Osborne Grace &amp; Calders said: ''In
1990, St Andrews held the 119th Open Golf Championship. During that time
almost all of the local home-owning residents moved out, either to go on
holiday or to stay with family and friends and rent out their family
homes. Others stayed and rented out rooms.
''It can be quite a lucrative way to make some extra cash. The town is
just bombarded with tourists wanting to see the golf.''
Eve Brown Property Managers base their Open rental values on the
normal price, plus #50 each person per night over the four days of the
Open. Pamela Woods of Eve Brown Property Managers said: ''A typical good
quality two-bedroom apartment outwith the Open would cost around #300 to
#400 per week. During the Open it's anticipated that the same
accommodation can fetch around #1000 to #1500 a week.''
One Glaswegian who owns a holiday home in St Andrews is looking
forward to a profitable Open. ''I have a two-bedroom flat within half a
mile from the first tee which I have been letting on a permanent basis
for #400 a month. During the Open my agent has suggested that I will be
able to fetch as much as #1200,'' she says.
Apart from golf, St Andrews has plenty other attractions. The rugged
remains of St Andrews Castle, the University grounds, the Golf Museum
and the beach are all close by. St Andrews is an year-round place and
has an active market for rented accommodation, with demand from the
large student population and academics.

FOUR cities were yesterday short-listed to stage the 2002 Winter
Olympic Games. Salt Lake City in the United States, Oestersund (Sweden),
Quebec City (Canada), and Sion (Switzerland) will go forward to a final
ballot of the International Olympic Committee's 100 full members in
Budapest on June 16.
Yesterday's decision, announced by IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch in Lausanne, meant that five bidding cities were eliminated --
Graz (Austria), Sochi (Russia), Jaca (Spain), Tarvisio (Italy), and
Poprad-Tatry (Slovakia).
Olympic observers say that Salt Lake City, which lost out narrowly to
Nagano in the contest to host the 1998 Games, will start the final
stretch as favourite.

DURING 1994, Save &amp; Invest dealt with about 2000 people. About half
were existing clients and a third were referrals from existing ones. It
is a fair measure of customer satisfaction.
''The biggest danger these days,'' says Jeffrey Deans, ''is the
approaches made by so-called investment experts to people with lump
sums. Many of them are mere salesmen.
''We are qualified independent advisers, with access to the widest
possible range of investment opportunities. The 35 people employed at
our Hope Street premises and West Regent Street headquarters are trained
to the highest standards.''
Save &amp; Invest is conscious of the fact that it is ''other people's
money'' it is dealing with. Investment decisions are taken in
partnership after a two-way information exchange: the clients spelling
out their financial situations and aspirations and Save &amp; Invest
expounding the investment products and opportunities available.
Once the aims have been agreed, Save &amp; Invest comes up with a report
in writing, within seven days. This details the investment package it
recommends and why, the income it might produce, and the categories of
investment products chosen.
There have been few disappointments in the past decade, which has seen
significant successes. Even taking the disappointing 1994 figures into
account one of the Distribution Bonds is, for example, achieving an
income figure equivalent to about 15% of an original investment of
#10,000 (in other words, an income now of about #1500 per annum), while
the original capital has nearly doubled in size. That is after paying a
total income of #9000 down the years.
One investment trust, says Jeffrey Deans, has paid 67% more than a
typical building-society account over a five-year period, with the
figure rising to 185% more in a 10-year comparison.
The performances of such trusts, and the other funds and investments
recommended by Save &amp; Invest, are constantly monitored.

THERE has probably never been a time when so many people are accepting
early retirement in one form or another, and finding themselves with
lump sums to invest. And there has never been a time when it was more
important to secure the best advice available on what to do with them .
How much better, then, to do so in an unintimidating atmosphere, with
expert help freely available on the options open to you. How much wiser,
in fact, to get such advice in writing from a qualified and independent
adviser who has studied your own particular circumstances and has
ascertained in discussion with you what the priorities must be.
The combination of quality advice in an informal setting has been the
secret behind the Save &amp; Invest success story. Still located in Hope
Street, though now at improved premises at No. 231 (having moved from
161), this rather unique investments and savings shop has proved a haven
for a wide variety of customers in the past decade.
These customers -- numbering a total of about 12,000 -- have felt free
to browse among a variety of literature about the investment products
available these days. Some have had about #10,000 to invest, and the
range extends to one who had 50 times that sum. Some, whisper it, have
been business journalists who were not exactly innocents in the
financial jungle. All have received the same quality of service and
advice on how to make their money work hard on their behalf.
Jeffrey Deans, managing director of Save &amp; Invest, says most people
leaving employment early have pensions which are not adequate to meet
their week-to-week needs. The lump sum has therefore to make up the
shortfall.
Merely depositing it into a building society, he says, would be a
shame and he quickly produces figures to support his statement. Someone
with capital of #60,000 could expect to realise a spendable annual
income of #3300, as opposed to something like #2700 from an average
building-society account.
That represents 22% more income from the same investment pot. And
Deans makes the point that the capital can also increase in value, to
counter inflation, through the mix of no-risk and low-risk investments.
Should this seem like getting the best of both worlds, then that is
the way it has been for some time. A building society offers rock-solid
investment and investment products can carry a degree of risk. Mr Deans
produces some interesting figures, in fact, comparing the performances
of a number of investment trusts with a typical 90-day building-society
account.
Three of the trusts showed a minimal loss on the initial #10,000
investment in the first year, but went on to show the equivalent of
annual growths of between 11.5% and 13.1% over a five-year period, as
opposed to 6.2% for the building society. In hard cash terms, they were
worth #17,200, #17,390, and #18,490 as opposed to the building-society's
#13,480.
The tailored investment packages drawn up by Save &amp; Invest are likely
to include not only investment trusts but also the tax-efficient Tessas
and National Savings, high-earning building-society postal accounts, and
with-profits bonds, along with Personal Equity Plans and Distribution
Bonds.
It is a broad mix of investments, all of which command the expertise
of the fund managers involved. Save &amp; Invest follows a ''pyramid''
approach: ''By forming a secure base of secure and lower-risk
investments or plans,'' says Jeffrey Deans, ''we can then use some
degree of investment with greater risk and greater potential.
''We would normally recommend between 25 and 50% to be held in the
base areas, and for the balance of monies we would utilise investment
trusts and unit trusts as they receive professional fund management on a
daily basis, and the money is spread across a range of shares. That is
safer than simply exposing capital to individual shares.''
Investment bonds from insurance companies are also used. Distribution
Bonds offer a mixture of blue-chip shares and Government stock.
''Returns are generally slightly lower than investment trusts,'' says
Jeffrey Deans, ''but they can provide an investment which distributes
good levels of income.
''And past performance also shows sound capital growth. With-profit
bonds offer a very secure type of investment, with current returns of up
to 8.75% per annum net being available.''

SCOTTISH basketball's so-called ''big four'' -- Livingston Bulls,
Glasgow Brightsiders, Edinburgh Burger Kings, and Paisley -- are safely
through to the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup.
But which two reach the final could depend on whether the semi-finals
are seeded and, if so, what method is chosen.
Nothing is laid down in the regulations and so the role of the
competitions sub-committee and the league administrator, Danny Kaye,
become crucial.
Opinion is split on the fairest method. Glasgow Brightsiders favour
seeding: ''It should be decided by the current league positions,'' said
coach James McKechnie.
That would mean first playing fourth and second playing third, in
other words Glasgow playing Paisley and Livingston, the holders, meeting
Edinburgh Burger Kings.
Another way would be to seed last year's two finalists, Bulls and
Brightsiders, with the other two drawn out of the hat.
Kings, however, believe that there should be an open draw as the
excuse for seeding, that it was necessary to have the best two teams in
the final for television, is no longer valid as there is currently no
television contract.
Paisley, who are struggling to recover from an indifferent run of
form, would probably prefer an open draw but after going down 95-46 to
Kings in the league on Saturday night, could not count on any of the
possible permutations being favourable.

PETER Nicol's absence from the North Open and Scotland's decision to
back out of staging the British National championships in April have
been a disappointing double blow to Scottish squash.
With top English players Del Harris and Tony Hands, world-ranked No.9
and 17 respectively, having signed up for the North event in Aberdeen
next month, hopes were high that the world No.5 from Inverurie would
complete an impressive trio.
''But I've got a previous commitment to play in Austria,'' explained
the London-based Scottish champion. ''I would have loved to have been in
Aberdeen, but I am pleased that the event has the support of two of the
world's best players.''
Lack of sponsorship has prevented the British Closed tournament moving
north of the Border for a first time.
Scottish officials could not find the #30,000 they sought before the
deadline set by the English-based Squash Rackets Association. ''It is
disappointing, but we were put under pressure to make a decision, and we
had no choice but to back out,'' said Scottish squash secretary Norman
Brydon.
The Lamb's Club in London is likely to host the event in April. Nicol,
who lost in last year's final, again will be one of the favourites.

SHELL yesterday set out to allay concerns of people in Fife and
Lothian, after an application to extend its petrochemical plant at
Mossmorran and Braefoot Bay loading terminal near Aberdour.
Mr Bob Strick, Shell UK public affairs manager, and one of its most
senior public affairs advisers, said at Braefoot Bay: ''We are aware of
the concerns, based upon perceptions in the local community which are
realities to them.''
He added that the company had no intention of putting the safety of
anyone at risk.
When questioned, however, he admitted that new procedures for the
loading of tankers at the terminal were improved after criticism by the
Health and Safety Executive, when one drifted from her moorings in 1993.
Shell has submitted an application for further development to
Kirkcaldy District Council. This has now been called in by Fife Regional
Council's planning committee, amid fears expressed by residents of
Aberdour.
Mr Strick explained that the reason for the application was because of
''crucial'' new finds off the Humber, soon to come on stream.
He agreed that there would be few jobs additional to the 550 already
employed at Mossmorran and the terminal, but said the move would
safeguard the Fife plant, and that at St Fergus, where gas is piped
ashore.
The plans represented a #140m investment in Fife, and would create
1000 jobs in the construction of the plants.
He said: ''We have been accused of being somewhat economical with the
truth in saying that only 1000 temporary construction jobs will be
created, but there will be a gradual build-up from 1997.
''We are assured that 840 of those jobs will come from Scotland, and
of the total, 475 will come from Fife.''
Shipping would increase by about 50% if the terminal extension went
ahead, but he claimed that the levels of risk were manageable, with tugs
on standby during the loading process and vessels treble-hulled to
reduce the possibility of fracture.
Referring to recent reports of high levels of benzene, a
cancer-causing pollutant found during the monitoring of tanker loading.
Mr Strick said there was no evidence to support this, although he
admitted that #3.5m was being invested in a vapour recovery system which
was not part of the planning application.

THE manner in which Great Britain beat the USA, the world's
third-ranked side, 2-1 in San Diego yesterday has already gone a long
way towards making this five-match women's hockey series a success.
In addition, the victory will have encouraged the British management
in their desire to re-establish the team on the world stage.
Their officials, however, are certainly not going overboard in the
belief that the team has already arrived. It is obviously much too early
for thoughts of grandeur in the series but the signs are good.
The ease with which the six Scots have dovetailed into the side is one
of the bonuses, and a great team spirit has been developed.
On the evidence of the first Test, the British women could now go on
and win the series, but it has to borne in mind that the Americans are
certain to become much stronger in the coming games, particularly in
defence.
However, team manager Jenny Cardwell was critical of her team in ''not
having punished mediocrity.''
Britain's inability to drive home their territorial advantage in terms
of goals will rightly be seen as one of the side's main failings. Not
least of these was their failure to make use of their 12 penalty
corners, which undoubtedly is an area for extra practice.
But the way in which the ball was played around by all the players was
more than could have been expected for a team in its first outing.
The British goals came in 12 and 73 minutes from Anna Bennett and Tina
Cullen respectively, after Marcia Pankratz had broken the deadlock a
minute beofre Bennett's goal.
The USA's trump card in winning the bronze medal in the World Cup in
July was their conversion rate in penalty corners, but while the
Americans did find the target once from the set-piece, the British
defence stood up well to their nine other efforts. This was to a great
extent due to the dominance and steadying influence of centre half Diane
Renilson.
Pauline Robertson, the team's vice-captain, was another great
influence, as was Susan Fraser. Robertson picked out Renilson as one of
the top Scots but that honour might well have gone to Rhona Simpson or
Susan MacDonald, had either of them been able to make better use of
their openings, particularly in the second half of the game.

COMMISSION from National Lottery ticket sales could provide as much as
a #1m profits boost for Dundee-based Watson &amp; Philip in the current
financial year.
Another good performance by the convenience stores and food
distribution group, which reported final results yesterday, was masked
by a #4.6m exceptional charge which eroded the Dundee-based company's
pre-tax profits by 15% to #10.6m.
However, the City wasted little time in gauging the underlying worth
of the figures -- operating profit rose by more than one-quarter -- and
the company's shares rose by 4p to 380p.
Watson offered a bullish outlook, with the final dividend of 10.6p
giving a total payout rise of 7% to 15.3p.
Based on sales figures during the first 10 weeks of the National
Lottery, about #1m in profit in the current financial year is expected
to be generated by outlets in Watson's Alldays stores, excluding
spin-off trade from the extra custom. The company receives 5p for every
#1 ticket sold and, taking into account costs of 2p in the pound, net
commission is 3p.
In the first eight weeks of the current reporting year, sales in the
Foodservice catering supply division, second in size in the UK only to
Booker's, were up 10% year-on-year.
A major expansion of Watson's convenience store chain has occurred
since the October 30 year-end, and sales and margins in the Trademarket
cash-and-carry operations, which are now concentrated in Scotland, are
holding up well.
Chief executive David Bremner said: ''It is the second year we have
managed to increase our shareholder value and it really shows that the
decision we took a couple of years ago, to reshape the group and
concentrate on convenience store retailing and the Foodservice
businesses, has literally paid dividends.''
Operating profits grew by 26% to #16m and, disregarding the accounting
adjustment for #4.6m in goodwill and an exceptional disposal gain, the
underlying pre-tax figure was up 21% at #14.2m.
Warburg upgraded its forecast of pre-exceptional, pre-tax profits for
the current financial year by #400,000 to #17.7m, 25% above the 1994
figure. Food retail analyst Neil Currie said: ''There is attractive
earnings growth. The shares currently offer a good yield and look
excellent value.''
Watson stressed the goodwill charge, which arose on disposal of its
Somercotes and Avon cash-and-carry businesses, had no effect on its
trading or cash flow position. New accounting rules dictated that the
goodwill, which had been properly written off against reserves on
acquisition, had to be charged to the profit and loss account on
disposal.
Since the year-end, Watson &amp; Philip has added another 61 stores to its
Alldays chain, 46 from the acquisition last month of the Circle C
convenience store business for #3.5m.
During the financial year, the company paid #9.2m for two franchise
companies, Convenience Stores West and Midlands Convenience Stores, and
opened another 20 Alldays outlets. Its Foodservice catering division
acquired South Kensington Continental Stores for #1.6m.
The Dundee company's move away from wholesaling is reflected in a
six-year deal which sub-contracts its SPAR/VG supply business to four
companies, which contributed #3.8m to profits.
Watson has quadrupled its number of convenience stores during the last
two years and currently operates 400 outlets.
''The decision to concentrate on convenience store retailing has been
implemented with a vengeance. We have said that we would be looking to
be expanding at the rate of 60-plus stores every year and we can see
that continuing,'' said Mr Bremner.
Turnover was down 23% to #440.6m but, adjusting for the impact of the
new SPAR/VG arrangement, sales were up an underlying 14.6%, boosted by
an increase in the number of convenience stores and gains in market
share for Foodservice.
Established Alldays stores achieved a 1% like-for-like sales increase
but sales mix changes, improved merchandising and better buying
continued to boost margins.
During the last two years, Watson has increased earnings per share by
40% to 27.9p.

BORIS Becker and Michael Stich, former Wimbledon champions who have
squabbled over Germany's Davis Cup team in recent seasons, will link up
for the first time for more than two years in the event next month.
Becker's manager Axel Meyer-Woelden said the three-times Wimbledon
champion had made himself available for Germany's home clash with
Croatia starting on February 3.
The German tennis federation confirmed Stich would team up with
Becker, whose decision to pull out of the event to concentrate on his
ranking had come under fire from his compatriot.

''KEEP politics out of sport'' was a war-cry of the sixties and
seventies, often shouted loudest by those who wished to retain links
with South Africa. I always thought it to be a somewhat ironic slogan
given that, in my experience, there was far more political infighting in
most sporting organisations than ever took place on the floor of the
House of Commons.
Over the past few days the Leader of the Opposition has, as it were,
emerged from the dressing-room and raced on to the football field.
Whether Tony Blair has smacked home a winner or scored an own goal is a
matter up for debate.
First, at a dinner to honour Sir Stanley Matthews' eightieth birthday,
he lambasted over-commercialisation of the ''People's Game'' and
suggested that Andy Cole, the latest Manchester United acquisition from
Newcastle, couldn't possibly be worth #7m. Then, in a newspaper on
Sunday, Tony came up with ''My manifesto for football''.
In the latter he warned of elitism and neglect of the grass roots and
promised Labour was ''developing a strategy for football, addressing
such questions as safeguarding televised sporting events for all, the
need for fans' representatives to be consulted at all levels of the
game; how to extend the valuable work of the Football Trust, giving it
the wherewithal to do so by allowing the football pools to compete on an
equal basis with the National Lottery, and how to ensure disabled people
are well provided for in grounds up and down the country.''
But, insisted Mr Blair, we don't want to interfere in the day-to-day
running of the game. Could have fooled me.
If the putative Prime Minister is saying transfer fees are ridiculous
and that there is too much greed in today's football, is that not just
the same as declaring that some top executives in former nationalised
industries are paying themselves too much? And, in soccer's case, is it
even true? Andy Cole is probably worth #7m. If Alex Ferguson had not
been as shrewd a judge, he would never have laid out such a sum.
Cole scores a lot of goals and he is English, a double banker as far
as his new club is concerned. If he helps Man U to success in a major
European competition he will repay every penny of the fee.
Mr Blair draws comparisons with the #2500 fee paid by Stoke for
Stanley Matthews in 1961. Hang on a minute, Tony -- Andy Cole is 23, Sir
Stan was 46 when his transfer went through.
To be sure, in a short, maybe 10-year, career Cole should be able to
become a millionaire, something which, regretfully, never happened to
Matthews. But is that not progress to be welcomed, skill receiving its
just reward? Surely Mr Blair is not suggesting we go back to the days of
the maximum wage, of virtual slave conditions, which people like Jimmy
Hill fought so hard to eliminate. That is strange talk coming from a
Socialist.
For every one Cole there are hundreds of young players who will be
lucky to take home #150 a week; some of them, as we have seen here in
Scotland, are tied to long-term contracts which make repayments to the
money-lenders seem like a good deal. Don't take my word for it, the
Players' Union leader, Tony Higgins, will provide chapter and verse.
Of course there are greedy people in football, though not, I suspect,
quite as many as live high off the public trough in the world of
politics. The game needs more Government interference likes it needs a
tackle from behind.
Yes, Tony, I would prefer if football players did not blatantly swear
on camera, spit almost incessantly, and display fewer dramatics when
brought down; I wish there were not so many changes of universally ugly
strips these days. But I would appreciate it even more if politicians
would stop behaving like spoilt brats at Question Time or in major
debates. You might like to show the red card -- if that colour is still
permitted -- to some in your own team.
Modern football has many warts, yet it retains a loyalty among the
general public to which political parties can only aspire.
Funny really; Mr Blair was invited to speak at the Sir Stanley dinner
only because John Major turned it down. I have no idea what the Prime
Minister might have said -- perhaps he could have explained why, if he
loves his sport so much, he appointed that tumshie Iain Sproat to be the
Minister for same.

CARLOS Sainz continues to lead the sixty-third Monte Carlo Rally but
by a reduced margin of 26 seconds, and is now the sole survivor of a
once formidable three-car Subaru Impreza team.
The 32-year-old Spaniard was briefly ousted from the lead during
yesterday's second leg of six speed tests, by last year's winner
Francois Delecour. The Frenchman, driving a Ford Escort, took a
26-second lead then made his second disastrous tyre choice in as many
days and dropped back to second.
But Sainz then heard on his car to car radio system that his
team-mates, Scotland's Colin McRae and Italian Piero Liatti, had both
crashed on the same corner of the last special stage before yesterday's
overnight halt in Digne-Les-Bains.
McRae, in only his second attempt at this event, had fought back from
nineteenth to sixth place after a minor accident on Monday and had
fifth-placed Didier Auriol, the world champion and a three-times Monte
Carlo winner, in his sights. But the Scot's car was too badly damaged
for him and co-driver Derek Ringer to continue.
Liatti lost more than 30 minutes before he could regain the road and
complete the timed section, dropping from seventh to seventeenth.
In third place is Finn Tommi Makinen, the new recruit to Andrew
Cowan's British-based Mitsubishi Lancer team.
Interim results after 12 of 21 special stages -- 1, C Sainz/L Moya
(Subaru Impreza) 3hr 53min 00sec; 2, F Delecour/C Francois (Ford Escort)
3-53-26; 3, T Mackinen/S Harjanne (Mitsubishi Lancer) 3-54-08; 4, J

GOALKEEPER Steve Ross volunteered to be a guinea pig in pioneering
heart surgery to save his football career.
Now Stranraer's miracle man -- he required an oblation, a technique to
burn away an extra valve in his heart -- is ready to add to Aberdeen's
heartbreak season by shutting them out of the Scottish Cup.
That place in the last 16 would be the best possible way for Ross to
celebrate next week the thirtieth birthday he thought he might never
see.
Stranraer almost caused Aberdeen grief in the Coca-Cola Cup earlier
this season, losing 1-0 at Pittodrie, with Ross performing heroics.
But Ross is ready to put up the shutters and close the last route to a
trophy for Willie Miller's side.
He insisted: ''I have had a few performances like that this season and
am confident I can do even better this time.
''We were overawed the last time we played Aberdeen because they have
been one of Scotland's major clubs for so many years.
''Since then their season has gone from bad to worse. They have a lot
of quality players who are not doing themselves justice.
''If they had extended their unbeaten run it could have worried us.
But losing four goals to Hibs has done our cause a power of good.
''They could have scored four or five times against us last time but
we also had a couple of chances.
''Now, we know what to expect and are confident of getting a replay at
least.
''Reconstruction meant we are the only club in Scotland to have been
promoted up two leagues. This had an effect on our form and we struggled
in the early stages.
''But we are now finding our feet and feel ready to produce one of the
shocks of the Cup.''

WORLD No.1 Pete Sampras extended his extraordinary defence of the
Australian Open tennis title with an emotional, moonlit win yesterday
over twice champion Jim Courier in Melbourne.
Sampras staged a brilliant comeback from two sets down for the second
time in successive matches to clinch a 6-7, 6-7, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 victory
over his fellow American in the tournament's most dramatic match for
some years.
The top-seeded Sampras, whose coach, Tim Gullikson, flew home in the
morning after five days in hospital, spent much of the final set
fighting back tears as the strain of the past week suddenly caught up
with him.
It was past 1am before he was able to nail down his tenth victory in
14 matches against Courier and secure a semi-final against another
American, Michael Chang.
After a Courier forehand had sailed way over the baseline to give
Sampras victory, the two players embraced at the net after four hours'
play.
Courier had powered past his opponent in tie-breaks for each of the
first two sets, but 23-year-old Sampras broke back early in the third
set and suddenly appeared a different player.
After having held serve in the opening game of the fifth set, Sampras
returned to his courtside chair and wept openly, eventually covering his
face with his towel.
At 1-1, Courier called out from the baseline: ''Are you all right,
Pete? We can always come back tomorrow to finish it off.''
Sampras saved five game points on Courier's serve and then broke for a
5-3 lead.He served out to love for the match and left the court to a
tumultuous standing ovation, not least from the large Greek contingent
who always support him in Melbourne.
Gullikson, 43, suffered two minor strokes late last year. He took ill
again at Flinders Park on Friday and was taken to a local hospital for
extensive tests. He was finally allowed to catch a flight home, but
Sampras has been clearly unsettled by the latest scare.
Spain's Conchita Martinez won through to her first Australian Open
semi-final with a tough 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 victory over American Lindsay
Davenport to set up a showdown with in-form Mary Pierce.
The 20-year-old Pierce, who dispatched Natalia Zvereva of Belarus in
just over an hour for her fifth successive straight-sets win, has
dropped only 21 games.
But Martinez, relishing outdoors after a drop in form on indoor
surfaces following her Wimbledon triumph, warned Pierce, the fourth seed
from France, that she was getting back to her best.
Sixth-seeded Davenport, only 18 but now the top-ranked American after
the retirement of Martina Navratilova, fought back to take the second
set but a horror statistic of 50 unforced errors told the story of the
match.
Canadian-born Pierce was in unstoppable form in her first set against
eighth seed Zvereva, taking it 6-1 in only 21 minutes with a series of
belting backhand winners. Zvereva hit back from 2-4 in the second set
but lost it 6-4.

MICHAEL Deveney, the new British featherweight boxing champion from
Paisley, was yesterday unperturbed by the controversy surrounding his
points defeat of Condorrat's Wilson Docherty for the vacant title at the
St Andrew's Sporting Club in Glasgow on Monday night.
''At the end of the day, I'm the champion, and that's all that
matters,'' he said.
''I knew I was the underdog and that suited me. Everyone had tipped
Wilson to win, but on the night I proved the more determined boxer. I
worked harder and I landed more punches,'' he added.
Docherty was convinced that he had been robbed and his manager, Tommy
Gilmour, will immediately begin plans to stage a rematch.
Deveney, however, has said that he would like to make his first
defence against another opponent before giving Docherty a second chance.
One man who wasn't impressed by Monday night's action was Sunderland's
Billy Hardy, who vacated the title to concentrate on a crack at the
European crown.
Hardy, also managed by Gilmour, expected his stablemate to win, but
said: ''Having watched the fight, I'm sorry I gave up the title -- I
could have beaten them both.
''I agree with the verdict of referee Dave Parris. Wilson
underestimated his opponent and was always looking for a one-punch
finish, which didn't come off.
''Wilson, however, can improve on that performance by 200% and I would
fancy him in a rematch.''

WOULD you like your daughter to turn out like Princess Di? One would
have thought not, unless your aspirations for her ran no further than
bulima and a husband with sticky-out ears.
None the less, Mrs Ann Williamson, head of Princess Diana's old
school, West Heath in Sevenoaks, Kent, is visiting Scotland in March to
talk to possible new pupils from north of the Border. Scottish girls she
quaintly describes as bringing a different perspective which enriches
the life of the school.
But perhaps the names of other famous former pupils would help make up
parents' minds. The school duly obliged with British tennis ''star''
Annabel Croft, and Princess Mary of Teck. No, I don't know who she is
either. Although I have heard a few fathers say that their wee princess,
Mary, has gone to the Tech, so perhaps that's what they mean.
As for what they will learn at West Heath, the school points out that
apart from a wide curriculum, all the girls are involved in drama from
the first year and are encouraged to write and direct their own
productions. A skill, some would say, Diana has used to the full.
Plain as the nose on one's face
ON the royal theme, it's strange that Prince Charles didn't rumble his
valet, Ken Stronach, sooner on his dastardly deed of clyping the
prince's secrets to the News of the World. As Prince Charles has been
learning Gaelic over the years, he should have known that stronach is
the Gaelic for nosy.
Champagne charlie
ONE would have thought that with all the money swilling about the
National Lottery, organisers Camelot would have a few quid to spend when
handing over the winning cheques. Sadly no, as Scots winners of some of
the more minor prizes discovered yesterday. Although there were three
handsome champagne bottles laid on to toast their success in front of
photographers, only one actually contained bubbly -- the others were
empty props.
It reminds me of the time as a naive young reporter I was sent with a
photographer to interview the winner of a Place the Ball contest. En
route the photographer bought two bottles of that curious cheapskate
substitute Pomagne. As the winner toasted her success, he instructed her
to turn the bottle so that the label wasn't showing. ''Do your
principles stop you from giving a product a free advert?'' I asked him
afterwards. ''No, you fool,'' he replied, ''I'm charging for two bottles
of champagne on my expenses.''
Crystal maze
WISHAW construction firm AF Angus was pleased to receive a booklet on
the efficient use of electricity from Scottish Power. Sadly the power
company is not so efficient on producing its booklets. It began at page
7, ran to page 12, went back to page 7, continued to page 18, then went
back to page 13, ran on to page 18 again, before leaping to page 25.
As is the way of these things, the booklet boasts the Crystal Mark,
which means it has ''clarity approved by the Plain English Campaign''.
Unless you try to read it of course.
Burns binge
EVEN as you read this, Burns Suppers, or to be accurate, Burns
Breakfasts, have already begun on this the bard's birthday. About 100
people were expected at the Eglinton Arms in Irvine this morning at
7.30am for the pub's Burns Breakfast, which attracts people going to
work, as well as those returning from night shifts. And yes they do have
speakers, tuck into haggis, and down the occasional half.
Owner Joe Caldwell is hoping to avoid the commotion of last year when
his Chinese chef put the haggis in the microwave oven, and the bags
burst. They were quickly wrapped in tinfoil, but the Burns afficionado
who was saying the Address to the Haggis claimed it was beneath his
dignity to stab a lump of tinfoil.
Much like Edinburgh Festival-goers who try to see as many shows as
they can in the one day, it is claimed by one enthusiast that by
starting at the Eglinton Arms it is possible to attend six separate
Burns functions today. Rounded off, no doubt, with a stomach pump at the
nearest infirmary.
A Red, Red Rose
BURNS'S birthday would seem an appropriate occasion to end with a drop
of poetry. Left-wing Labour members, unhappy with Tony Blair's tinkering
with their precious principles, have been ending their functions with
what they call the Blair Dance. To the tune of hokey cokey they sing:
We put the Clause 4 in,
You take the Clause 4 out,
You stamp on all our principles
And you shake the lefties out,
You smile at everybody
As you spin around the floor,
That's what it's all about.
Oi! Tony, Tony, Tony.
Not quite as eloquent as Burns would have put it, but he may have
had some sympathy for the sentiments.

Ian Hamilton, QC, advocates communication classes for our judges
NOT so long ago a judge on the Aberdeen Circuit sent a jury home at
the end of their first day in court with these words: ''I give you this
direction. You must not discuss this case with anyone other than among
yourselves. The reason I give you that admonition is because of the
collegiate nature of your duties.''
Having thus delivered himself, his Lordship went home for his tea. So
did the jurors, bearing thoughtfully with them the warning about the
collegiate nature of their duties.
It is a warning that has forever warmed my heart. I think of these 15
Buchan jurors going home to their husbands, their wives or their
bidie-ins, all anxious to learn and to tell how the day's jury service
has gone. I imagine the conversation going something like this:
''Fit like then?''
To which the juror, obedient to the judge's command replies: ''I
cannot answer that question. I was admonished not to do so, because of
the collegiate nature of my duties.''
The only possible response would be a glazing of the eye and the one
word: ''Jings!''
Aficionados of the fantastic will know the judge to whom I refer, but
torture will not wring his name from me. Yet most of us are guilty of
such patent absurdities. There were several of them in the sentence of
warning quoted above. We lawyers know what we mean by a ''direction''
but to ordinary members of the public it means something quite
different. I doubt if admonition will have any meaning whatever.
It seems that we lawyers can't speak in court without opening a mouth
as old and as incomprehensible as Stonehenge. Take the typescript of any
charge to a jury and you will find it replete with words that are beyond
the horizon of everyday language. Look at the word charge for a start.
What fear does it strike into a timid juror to hear that they are all
going to be charged tomorrow?
Look at the word onus. I challenge the existence of this word in
everyday Queen's Scottish. Oh it might just pass, but other words and
phrases come more readily to mind. Would we really say: ''The onus is on
you to buy the next round''? I doubt it. We would say: ''It's up to
you'' or even ''It's on you''. What, therefore, is inherently wrong in
saying: ''It's up to the Crown throughout to prove their case''?
The next direction is about the need for corroboration. Without it a
charge would be a nullity. Corroboration? In everyday language not even
lawyers speak of corroboration. Indeed modern dictionaries give its use
as archaic. What on earth is the ordinary person to make of a direction
involving the use of a word which has been out of use for a century or
more?
I challenge the use of the word on another ground. It is an inaccuracy
as well as an archaism. Its dictionary meaning is ''supportive''. We use
it to mean ''complementary''. Yet in 40 years of advocacy I have never
heard a judge charge a jury without using this obsolete word. Sometimes
I think that when we start talking or writing to a captive audience we
bleat like sheep. Did you see me at it too just a few lines back?
I used the word nullity. What ordinary punter sitting on a jury or
reading this newspaper is ever going to bother to think out what I mean
if I say a thing's a nullity? I will now put it into an everyday context
to show its absurdity. I will use it in the context of the most
important subject ot all.
''He was affside, so he wus. Yon goal was a fundamental nullity.''
The absurdity of such a sentence should be clear to us all, but there
will still be those who will argue that legal concepts must be conveyed
in a proper legal form of language, which the jury must be presumed to
understand. The truth is that judges don't really address juries at all.
They address the appeal court. Everything they say is taken down by a
shorthand writer and may be used in evidence against them.
They are afraid that if what they say is not said in the same language
as our grandparents used they will be criticised, and get a row from
above. They wouldn't use the word row, but you can bet they know what it
means. Thus does the law live up a creek without a paddle, while the
majestic river of language passes by.
Would it be too much for judges to take short courses in
communications from communicators?
People on the telly speak differently from our judges, and I know
which are the more easily understood. Classes for our judges? Yes for
every one of them. The collegiate nature of their duties makes them
necessary.

ANTHONY Hamilton, one of the best break-builders in snooker, finally
claimed a notable scalp in Newport yesterday by beating sixth seed Alan
McManus.
The world No.35 reached the last 16 of the Regal Welsh Open with a 5-3
win over the Scot, producing breaks of 136, 122, 61, and 65. McManus
agreed Hamilton had taken his chances well, but groaned: ''I played
absolute garbage.''
Hamilton now meets Ronnie O'Sullivan, who needed only 50 minutes to
whitewash Mike Hallett, who marvelled: ''That's probably the best
display of potting I have ever seen.''
O'Sullivan had breaks of 30, 67, 108 -- which began with a pot when
the cue ball was tucked under the baulk cushion -- 77, 55, and 83.
Stephen Hendry stretched his unbeaten sequence to 19 matches with a
routine 5-2 victory over Karl Payne.
Skoda Grand Prix champion John Higgins again got out of jail. The
teenage Scot, who edged Dene O'Kane 5-4 on Monday from 0-4, won the
closing two frames to pip Stephen Lee 5-4. Second-round results:
J Swail (N Ire) beat S Murphy (Ire) 5-3; A Bolsover (Eng) beat J Cundy
(Eng) 5-3; J Read (Eng) beat D Morgan (Wal) 5-3; P Davies (Wal) beat W
Thorne (Eng) 5-4; J Higgins (Sco) beat S Lee (Eng) 5-4; A Hamilton (Eng)
beat A McManus (Sco) 5-3; S Davis (Eng) beat D Harold (Eng) 5-3; P Ebdon
(Eng) beat D Taylor (N Ire) 5-4; R O'Sullivan (Eng) beat M Hallett (Eng)
5-0; C Scanlon (Eng) beat J Ferguson (Eng) 5-3;  M Williams (Wal) beat J
Johnson (Eng) 5-3; M Flowerdew (Eng) beat M Judge (Ire) 5-4; S Hendry
(Sco) beat K Payne (Eng) 5-2.

HUNTLY'S Doug Rougvie is well versed in the romance of the cup and the
defender, who played at the top end of the game on both sides of the
Border with Aberdeen and Chelsea, has warned his current team-mates to
beware the men from Burntisland Shipyard.
He has been telling them to be careful of the Fife club and may even
have gone as far as to say they shouldn't allow the shipyard to wreck
their hopes of cruising into the next round. Then again, maybe he
didn't.
Rougvie, you see, has been a little confused lately. In fact, the
player who won three Scottish Cup winners' medals with Aberdeen said
yesterday that he will miss the tie because he got his holdiday dates
mixed up. While his team-mates are running around Christie Park on
Saturday he will be sunning himself in Tenerife.
However, he insists he'll be kicking every ball from a distance. ''I'd
rather be up to my ankles in mud at Huntly,'' he said. Oh, really?
If Huntly lose will Rougvie have to reckon with the rest of the
players? We shall see, although he believes his team will win without
him.
''If Huntly were to reach the quarter-finals it would be a fairytale.
It would also put the club on the map. I have seen it all and done it
all in my career, but the cup is still special for me.''
Not quite as special as a holiday in Tenerife, though.

FINANCIAL markets are set for a further increase in interest rates
from their current level of 6.25%, probably by a [1/2]-point next week
after the Governor of the Bank of England's regular monthly meeting with
the Chancellor.
Yesterday's Quarterly Industrial Trends Survey from the CBI confirmed
other economic data signals, not least the December Retail Price Index
and the higher than expected GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 1994,
that there are growing price pressures.
The percentage of firms planning to raise domestic prices between now
and April, minus those expecting to lower them, has soared to 33% from
20% in the last survey. The economy is also shown to be continuing to
grow at a fast pace.
In the foreign exchange market, the pound firmed on the expectation of
a rate hike. Out of 27 economists, 21 are looking for a rate increase
next month compared with five expecting to wait until March and one who
saw equal odds on both months.
The CBI trends survey, to which the Chancellor attaches considerable
importance, shows that business and particularly export confidence has
risen further, while manufacturing output grew sharply over the past
four months.
Orders also increased more quickly than expected in both domestic and
overseas markets. Over the next four months, while domestic demand
growth slows slightly, total demand is expected to continue growing
strongly.
Total new orders picked up more than expected and grew at their
fastest rate since April 1988, with manufacturers recording their
strongest improvement in export orders for nearly 10 years. And output
has also risen more sharply than expected.
The projected rise in demand is primarily due to buoyant export order
expectations, the most ever since the CBI first asked this question on a
volume basis in July 1977.
On the downside, although remaining very uneven across industrial
sectors, there are some signs of upward pressure on prices, unit costs
and plant capacity. The expected pick up in prices over the next four
months also reflects seasonal factors.
The CBI suggests, as it has done in previous surveys, that the
intention to raise prices may be at least partly defeated by consumer
resistance and Mr Andrew Buxton, chairman of the CBI's Economic Affairs
Committee, yesterday sought to play down the need for the Chancellor to
lift base rates. But this seemed more in hope than expectation.
However, competitive pressures remain strong in both home and export
markets and this could continue to be a constraining factor.
But the inflationary pressures are there and with the financial
markets now firmly convinced that an increase is in the offing, it would
be hard for the Chancellor to put this off without triggering an adverse
reaction, although he may still be tempted to wait until more data in
the middle of February.
This, though, would seem pretty pointless, even counterproductive, if
it is going to come anyway and the Governor of the Bank of England, an
inflation hawk, is likely to favour an early move.
Over the past four months the increase in unit costs was, in fact,
slower than reported and expected last October. And domestic prices rose
in line with unit costs, but more slowly than anticipated.
Companies now expect costs to rise at the fastest rate for four years,
but pressure on costs does vary markedly, with several industrial
sectors expecting moderate increases.
Most increases in company costs are due to rising imported raw
material prices and these continue to build up, but have not fed fully
into higher prices.
Investment intentions remain positive but are now less buoyant than
they were last October, which the CBI says is a little puzzling and may
reflect continued concerns of companies about the likely strength of
demand over the coming year.
The results of the next survey should give more of an indication as to
whether investment plans have altered.
Capacity utilisation, another important pointer for the Chancellor,
has risen slightly since last October, with 49% of firms working below
capacity, the lowest level since mid-1990. But 24% of firms say shortage
of plant capacity is likely to limit output over the next four months.
However, 34% of companies, the highest proportion since April 1990,
plan to invest in new capacity.
Economists at securities house Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, suggest that
on a seasonally adjusted basis the monthly increase in our core measure
of retail prices has been on a rising trend since May and seems broadly
based. It also looks to be heading further up in the coming months.
The increase in excise duties, along with the quarter point increase
in mortgage rates announced by several mortgage lenders, will push up
the headline rate and would be accompanied by a further rise in
underlying inflation towards 3%.
Moreover, the 1995 pay round is now getting underway and while, so
far, average earnings have been restrained, this may not continue to be
the case.
Even before the findings of the CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends
Survey, the market expected an increase in interest rates. The survey
merely hardens this opinion.

Andrew Lothian finds society's ignorance of the law Kafkaesque
''THERE'S never one about when you need him,'' said the judge. He was
referring not as many people do to a policeman, or a taxi-driver even,
but to a journalist.
The problem, as the speaker perceived it, was that every time that he
wanted to make a pronouncement ex cathedra, or at least from the bench,
there was no-one there with a trilby hat and a battered notebook to make
sure the words went outwith the four walls. So all his ''There's too
much of this going on'' and ''Let one thing be clearly understood at the
outset'' were but as sweetness wasted on the desert air.
Actually, it seems to me that a good lot of law does get into the
papers: just have a look in today's Herald for example and see what
would be left without the assistance of the criminal classes. The fact
remains, however, that there is now so much law about that even lawyers
do not know most of it. Questions like, How long have you got to send in
your income tax return? Why can't you distil your own whisky? and, Can a
girl of 14 make a valid will? may be easy for some people, perhaps, but
not for many.
Partly the situation has arisen because of the amount of legislation
put through by a modern Parliament: our common law, that is to say,
broadly, what is derived from custom as mediated through judicial
decisions, becomes less important with every day (and Act) that passes.
And a good thing too you might think; substantive rules of law which
have their basis in such ideas as that a wife and children are
effectively the property of their husband and father are hopelessly out
of tune with our times.
On the other hand, it cannot be a good thing for people to live in a
rule-based society when they don't know what the rules are.
To say that ignorance of the law is no excuse was all very well in the
days when all that you had to do to be in the clear was to be reasonably
familiar with the provisions of the Book of Leviticus and the priorities
of the local magistrates, but it seems a bit far fetched in days when
the new laws for the year 1993 (52 new public Acts) run to thousands of
pages and the Court of Session reports are still years in arrears.
Nowadays we might be more realistic if we were to follow the example
of one recent South African case and treat a mistake about the law,
which does not provide a relevant defence to a criminal charge, as a
mistake about a question of fact, which does.
One of the difficulties caused by all this is that it is almost
impossible to get any proper debate going on law reform. The only people
who can claim to be well informed are pressure groups, and they are not
exactly impartial participants.
For example, if our criminal law is not working as well as it should,
what is to be done? Change the law, says one group. Do away with the
right to silence (which is abused by professional criminals and
terrorists), let the jury know about the previous convictions, deny
Legal Aid unless a plausible defence is to be put forward, and in
general stack things against the accused.
It may be thought surprising that this group does not suggest the
abolition of the presumption of innocence, on the basis that it is both
illogical and offensive to start a trial on the footing that the police
have got the wrong man in the dock.
No, no the law is fine, says the next pressure group: what we need are
more and better prosecutors: it is absurd to see hours of expensive
police work going down the drain because some hard-pressed fiscal has
not had time to plan a prosecution properly.
And then we come to punishment. More prisons, say some: they may not
do any good but at least criminals are not out thieving if they are in
their cells. And if 90% of house-breakings are unsolved, it is
reasonable to assume that a large proportion of them are being done,
undetected, by people who have received non-custodial sentences in the
community for something similar.
More social workers, say others: custody is expensive and not much
more than a university of crime, let's have some heavyweight social work
input.
More jobs, say others: crime is a direct consequence of poverty (in
most cases: but see Robert Maxwell: well actually if the truth be told
he was really worse off than anyone could ever hope to be).
Fewer lawyers: say others: to provide a free defence for people who,
if the worst comes to the worst, are not likely to get more than a fine
anyway is illogical: save Legal Aid for cases where there is a prospect
of custody at the end and put the money saved to better use elsewhere in
the criminal justice system, eg more prosecutors, social workers, police
officers on the beat, victim support, more journalists in court so that
what happens there is more fully reported. Why spend state money on the
least deserving?
Well that is possibly enough about what the pressure groups have to
say. What I am more concerned with is the situation in which ignorance
of the law means that the only people with much say as to what really
goes on are those professionally involved.
For example, I wonder if it is generally known just how many crimes
which might be proved in court never get that far, since decisions are
taken, both by police officers and by prosecutors, that in the
circumstances the matter need go no further. A society in which people
do not know why they are not being prosecuted for breaking laws which
they didn't know existed in the first place is, I think, Kafkaesque.

WIDE says it all about Chelsea's John Spencer. He can play his
football on the wing and in his native Glasgow wide is a word which
could be brought into play to describe character.
What he lacks in height he makes up for in wit and self-belief. One of
those typical gallus Glaswegians, Spencer doesn't walk so much as strut.
He has had a few hard knocks in his time. Leaving Rangers was one of
the most damaging blows to his psyche, although he recovered to take
advantage of his opportunity to perform in the limelight.
But he kept picking himself up and trying again. His determination to
prove he can play began to pay off towards the end of last year when he
won two Scottish caps. He intends to add a few more this year.
First, though, he will have to deal with another product of Glasgow's
streets when Chelsea play Millwall at the Den in the FA Cup on Saturday,
when Alex Rae will be waiting to deliver a blow to both Spencer and
Chelsea, for old times' sake.
Rae and Spencer were kids on the ground staff at Ibrox at the same
time and a bond was formed. They were on the same wavelength, which was
a different frequency from anyone else around them and they moved as one
even when they were in the same Scottish under-21 squads.
They both played against Switzerland's under-21 side several years ago
and the day after they were to be found in a Berne cafe offering pearls
of their own wisdom to anyone who cared to stop and listen. They had
allowed a stretch of a boy, Duncan Ferguson, to tag along and he sat in
their company totally bemused by the sharp banter of two rascals.
Come to think of it, if any psychologists out there are looking for
reasons to help explain Ferguson's erratic behaviour they might try to
examine that morning in Berne.
Rae remembers well his trips abroad with the young Scots and is still
smarting from the humiliation caused by Spencer during a tournament in
France. Indeed, he plans revenge in the cup-tie.
''I have a few scores to settle with John, but in particular I owe him
for the way he embarrassed me while we were on international duty in
Toulon,'' Rae said. ''There we were with our best gear on getting ready
to go to an official function when I discovered he had pinched my shoes.
''The only other footwear I had was a pair of trainers and when
matched with my suit I looked like Rab C Nesbitt.''
Millwall earned the right to play Glenn Hoddle's Chelsea side thanks
to a surprise 2-0 replay win against Arsenal, whose manager George
Graham first used to be in charge at the Den. The forceful midfield play
of Rae has done much to put the roar back into the Lions' season.
The atmosphere which will be generated by 21,000 supporters inside the
Den will help make this game one of the most exciting of the round.

FORMER German international striker Roland Wohlfarth was yesterday
banned for failing a dope test. The ex-Bayern Munich player, who now
plays for Bochum, tested positive for a stimulant at an indoor
tournament in Leipzig on January 5.
Wohlfarth, a former leading goalscorer in the Bundesliga, is the first
player to face German soccer federatrion (DFB) proceedings for drug
abuse although other former professionals have admitted to taking drugs
in the past.
The 31-year-old forward, who recently returned to play in Germany from
France, has admitted to taking the appetite suppressant Recatol which
contained the banned stiumlant norephedrine.

OPTIMISM among Scottish companies remains more muted than in the UK as
a whole, according to the latest quarterly CBI Industrial Trends survey.
The net balance of 8% of Scottish firms reporting themselves more
optimistic about prospects is the ninth such positive balance in a row.
But that 8% figure is unchanged from October and this is the fifth
successive CBI quarterly survey in which Scottish firms appear less
optimistic than UK firms as a whole.
The balance of Scottish firms reporting a rising trend in orders in
the past four months -- while still just positive at +3% -- was at its
lowest level since July 1993. Order volumes in the UK as a whole rose
again, ahead of expectations, to the best performance seen in seven
years.
Given the general perception that UK recovery, this time around, is
benignly export-led, Scottish responses on export performance in the
past four months are particularly disappointing.
Last October a balance of 17% of Scottish firms were predicting higher
volumes of export orders. In the event a balance of only 1% achieved
them. On export delivery volumes, a positive balance of 28% last October
was anticipating increases in the period. A balance of just 5% achieved
them.
Despite both these shortfalls, a balance of 19% of Scottish firms in
the survey remain more optimistic about export prospects than they were
in October. And a remarkable positive balance of 43% expect to be able
to raise export prices in the next four months.
Neither John Ward, CBI Scotland's chairman, nor Lex Gold, the Scottish
director, could explain this confusing picture. ''We need to wait for
the next survey to see whether this is simply aspiration,'' said Mr
Gold.
CBI Scotland's Industrial Trends panel -- which reviews each quarter's
results and took a generally more bullish view than the survey's 111
respondents this time around -- could not shed any additional light on
the export findings, according to John Ward.
Electronics accounts for some 40% of Scotland's total exports and two
representatives from that sector, one from a principal producer, the
other from a sub-contractor, sit on the Trends panel.
According to the CBI Scotland chairman, the subcontractor reports a
less-marked seasonal fall-off in demand than in previous years. And the
principal producer reports world markets holding up reasonably well.
Pending new evidence of what is going on, the reported export
underperformance remains something of a mystery.
In UK markets, a net positive balance of 29% of Scottish firms is
expecting to be able to raise average prices in the next four months,
triggered in large measure by rising raw material prices.
That expectation is fuelled by the experience of the past few months.
Last October, a balance of 20% of Scottish firms were expecting to raise
domestic prices. The latest survey reveals that a balance of 18% managed
to make increases stick.
The problem, as with the UK findings in general, is that this growing
appetite for price increases will encourage the Chancellor and the Bank
of England into an early interest rate rise to choke off any
inflationary conseqences.
John Ward doubts if the evidence on price pressures is yet
sufficiently strong to force the Chancellor's hand. If he is wrong in
that, and the deteriorating performance of Scottish exporters is
confirmed by future evidence, higher interest rates and a faltering
Scottish recovery could meet head-to-head before long.

FEATURING in the Guinness Book of Records cannot be the easiest route
to immortality. The publishers may demand signed log books to record
''unremitting surveillance'', and even then there is no guarantee of a
mention. Such has been the fate of an Indian youth called Parthasarthy,
who this week made his 85th try by eating two rose bushes. It was a
heroic act, although less hazardous than his next attempt, which is to
eat 625 chillies. His previous efforts have included pushing a mustard
seed backwards with his nose for a quarter of a mile, and swallowing 36
raw eggs. As Guinness point out, however, unique occurrences are not in
themselves records. Exploits like riding in full armour from Edinburgh
to Dumfries, which took Mr Dick Brown 28 hours in the saddle, are judged
purely on their merits. Even then, records invite competition. World
fame could last for only a single edition.
The best route to immortality seems to be giving one's name to
something. The Scottish chemist Charles Macintosh is remembered as a
raincoat, and John McAdam for his tarmac roads. The 7th Earl of Cardigan
lives on as a woolly jumper, and 2nd Earl of Yarborough as a poor hand
of cards. Even Brownie points are said to derive from a superintendent
of the Pullman Car Company.
The most lasting fame probably comes through science. Who would
remember the botanist Leonhard Fuchs without fuchsias, or Anders Dahl
without dahlias? It is honour usually conferred for merit. Mr John
Gutfreund, who arranged a financial deal whereby Sweden wrote off a #16m
Costa Rican debt in return for the establishment of a 210,000-acre
national park, had a new species of wasp named after him. He is now
immortalised in wasp textbooks as Eruga gutfreundi. The deal can be
purely financial, however. At the last World Congress of Herpetology,
potential sponsors were being offered a link with two new varieties of
skink, a kind of Madagascan burrowing lizard. Being remembered as a
reptile may not be the most desirable route to fame, of course, but it
is safer that eating 625 chillies.

GILLIAN Martin last won the national singles badminton title in 1988
but, thanks to some convincing form over the past few months, the Barnt
Green player could well make 1995 her year when she lines up at the
Hydro-Electric Scottish national championships at Meadowbank on February
4 and 5.
Martin earned an impressive scalp last weekend when she defeated
Britain's current No.1 player, Julia Mann, at the Staffordshire Open,
yet the Scottish No.1 has not been seeded for the Edinburgh event.
''I feel I am very unlucky not to be seeded in the top two,'' said
Martin. ''I think they calculated the seedings before my victory at the
weekend, but even so, I am the current No.1. Now, it will be a toss of
the coin to see what half of the draw I will be in. I have been drawn
against Anne Gibson in the early stages of the competition for the past
two years.''
Gibson, the only Scot in the British Olympic squad and herself a
semi-finalist at the Staffordshire Open, has been named top seed, while
Aileen Travers, who defeated Martin in the final of the
Wilson-Dunfermline Open to prevent her from taking three Scottish
victories out of three, has been seeded No.2.
Martin and Gibson, five times Scottish champion, have not faced each
other all season and, in fact, have met only twice in the past two
years, a reality which has made Martin all the more anxious to meet her
in the final.
Meanwhile, the Scottish Badminton Union have announced the purchase of
the Cockburn Centre in Glasgow, an all-purpose badminton centre that
also includes the union's administrative offices. A #30,000 grant from
the Scottish Sports council made the sale possible.
* DEFENDING champion Darren Hall is top seed for the English National
championships at Norwich Sport Village from February 10 to 12. The chief
threat to Hall, who is aiming for his eighth men's singles title, is
expected to come from Surrey's Anders Nielsen, the No.2 seed and 1992
champion.

EDINBURGH sheriff and regular law-page columnist Andrew Lothian is
obviously not a man to be messed with.
A man recently appeared before three judges in the appeal court at
Edinburgh complaining about the length of detention imposed by Sheriff
Lothian, who is apparently known as ''maximum Bob'' because of his
no-nonsense sentencing policy.
The aggrieved appellant told the court: ''He gave me the maximum. He
put a noose round my neck and pulled it.''
Say no more
WE are all in favour of everyone having a fair hearing and deplore the
kind of lurid pre-trial publicity that has featured in the English media
over the Frederick West case without so much as a slap on the wrist by
the attorney general.
But surely former Edinburgh Lord Provost Kenneth Borthwick (and former
Consul-General for Malawi in Scotland) was taking caution to extremes
when he was questioned in The Herald about criminal charges about to be
brought against Dr Hastings Banda.
''I've nothing to say about that. It is sub judice you know.'' We can
only hope prospective jurors in Malawi are not regular Herald readers
(more on this later).
Free to roam
EVERYONE makes mistakes, especially with pressure of work and so on,
but we must hope that the one we recount here does not end up resulting
in more red corpuscles spilled on the streets of Glasgow.
A machete-wielding thug who left his victim scarred for life in a pool
of blood in Mitchell Street was found guilty of assault to severe injury
and permanent disfigurement after a jury trial at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
Before passing sentence the sheriff asked for social inquiry reports.
That was on December 16 and the clerk put the case down for sentencing
on January 9. Unfortunately this was an arithmetical error as this
should have been done within 21 days and that date was 24 days hence.
Come the appearance, the defence solicitor pointed out the mistake and
the sheriff had no choice but to release his client, who is now free to
walk the mean streets of the city once more. Let's hope that was a
lesson to him about how seriously society regards people carving up
their fellow citizens with long-bladed knives.
Bastions of the
Law (No 69)
FEW practising lawyers in Britain can lay claim to having held two
Cabinet posts in a foreign government, but then Colin Cameron, who runs
his office in Irvine's High Street, is no ordinary solicitor.
Cameron, now 61, qualified in Glasgow in 1957 when prospects and pay
for himself and his wife Alison, a midwife, were much brighter in
Nyasaland than Nile Street.
They became good friends of two young African lawyers, Orton and Vera
Chirwa. Colin was one of the first white members of the African National
Congress, later to become the Malawian Congress Party, and as such he
and his family were ostracised by the colonial white community.
Then came the emergency when the British authorities rounded up all
the dissidents, including the future president, Dr Hastings Banda.
Cameron, as secretary of the Law Society, was given the job of
organising their defence: ''It seemed to be quite straightforward. What
they were asking for was fairly reasonable and I thought Britain was
being unusually difficult in allowing them to gain independence.''
At the end of his contract, Banda asked him to stay on and stand for
elections. Duly returned for the Soche district of Blantyre, he was then
enlisted into the Cabinet (first as Minister of Works, then Minister of
Transport and Communications) alongside his chum Orton who was attorney
general.
Then came the nightmare. Banda's crackdown forced Cameron and his
colleagues to flee for their lives. ''We were given protection in a
Church of Scotland mission before we managed to get a plane out. He was
murdering so many people at that time. There was certainly no
reconciliation in the air.''
Thirty years of repression followed. The Chirwas were kidnapped by
Malawian agents in Tanzania and later held for eight years in the same
prison. It was only a visit by British lawyers that allowed them to meet
shortly before his death in 1992.
Now the wheel as turned full circle. Deposed in elections, Banda and
his deputy John Tembo now face trial for the alleged murder of three
Cabinet Ministers and an MP in 1983. An inquest has also opened into
Orton's death.
Cameron and his wife went back to Malawi for the first time last year
and to an enthusiastic welcome from the new Government. There was time
to visit Orton's grave and those of other victims of the Banda regime.
''I hope the inquest comes up with something,'' he said. ''Something
happened the night before he died. Banda always said Orton would never
get out of jail alive.''
The Camerons, who later did another stint abroad with Voluntary
Service Overseas in the Solomon Islands, have joined with Lady Morton of
Shuna, to raise funds for Vera Chirwa. So far it has sent out #13,500 to
support her in promoting human rights and women's welfare.
The Chirwas follow a distinguished tradition of Southern African
lawyers like Ghandi and Mandela who viewed justice in its wider context.
Cameron is pleased this is being maintained by another generation of
Malawian lawyers, but he grieves at Britain's failure to give support to
a country which has peacefully transformed itself into a democracy after
traumas similar to those in South Africa.
''It has been 30 wasted years and it is very sad that people are still
literally dying in the streets in rural areas from malnutrition.''

Stranraer 2, Raith Rovers 4
RAITH Rovers eventually brushed Stranraer aside at Stair Park last
night, but it was a hard-fought encounter.
0 Rovers took the lead after 24 minutes when Barry Wilson unleashed a
tremendous drive high into the roof of the net.
But Stranraer shook Raith seven minutes later. Robert Reilly took a
free kick on the right and Raith's defenders got into a tangle in the
middle. Tony Gallagher got the break of the ball, turned neatly and gave
keeper Scott Thomson no chance.
The home side took the lead in 57 minutes when Dave Sinclair sliced
the ball past his own keeper but that joy was short-lived as the
visitors' showed their determination, levelling within a minute as
Crawford raced through to beat keeper Steve Ross.
Raith manager Jimmy Nicholl, who was earlier fined #200 and censured
by the SFA for criticism of referee Jim O'Hare after his side's 1-1 draw
with Dundee on October 15, set his side on the way to victory after 69
minutes when he tricked the Stranraer defence with a clever pass to
Wilson, who had no trouble hitting the net for his second goal.
With six minutes remaining Wilson completed his hat trick when he
side-footed home from close range.
Alloa 0, Forfar 2
TWO headed first-half goals from Steve McCormack and David Bingham
gave Forfar a well-deserved victory over Alloa at Recreation Park last
night.
Forfar were first to threaten with Sandy Ross bringing out a fine save
from keeper Jim Butter.
Alloa forced their way back into the game and came close to opening
the scoring with a header from Danny Diver which Forfar keeper Gordon
Arthur did well to hold.
But Forfar then turned up the heat.

Airdrie 2, Ayr United 2
AIRDRIE'S promotion hopes suffered a setback as they were held to a
draw by relegation-threatened Ayr.
The Diamonds are now level on points with Dunfermline in second place
in the first division, six points behind leaders Dundee.
Airdrie created more chances but it took a goal from the penalty spot
to earn a draw after Ayr had taken a surprise lead midway in the second
half.
Ayr's hopes of a first away win of the season were dented four minutes
later when Colin McFarlane handled in the box and Kenny Black made no
mistake from the kick.
Alex MacDonald's side had signalled their intentions early on with
some incisive moves.
Top scorer Andy Smith seemed set to open but was pulled up for
offside. Cammy Duncan did well to stop Paul Harvey's angular shot and
another Harvey effort was blocked by a wall of defenders in 15 minutes.
The home pressure continued and Duncan was again called into action to
cut out Harvey's inviting cross under pressure from Smith.
Airdrie did take the lead in 26 minutes when Jimmy Boyle fired the
ball home after a Jimmy Sandison shot deflected off Frank Rolling into
his path.
But the visitors equalised a minute later, Ian Gilzean heading home a
Vinnie Moore free kick for only the third away goal of the season for
Ayr.
After the interval a measured pass from the creative Harvey sent Smith
through, only for his cross to be intercepted in a crowded penalty box.
In a rare counterattack Kevin Gribben tried a long-range effort but
was well off target.
Airdrie came close in 62 minutes when Smith's overhead kick slipped
narrowly past, but Ayr went 2-1 up in 64 minutes, Rolling rising above
the Airdrie defence to head home Moore's pinpoint cross.
After Black's equaliser Airdrie pressed hard for the winner but the
Ayr defence held out.
Dumbarton 2, Morton 1
DUMBARTON gifted the opening goal and then stunned Morton with a
second-half fightback to earn the points.
It all looked so different during the first 45 minutes, when the
Greenock side dictated play and should have been more than one goal
ahead by the interval.
The goal was a comic-cuts affair, Marko Rajamaki putting them ahead
four minutes from the break. Dumbarton player-manager Murdo MacLeod got
into a tangle and his passback was short. Keeper Ian McFarlane rushed
out of goal and completely missed his kick, leaving the Finn to put the
ball into the empty net.
MacLeod stayed inside for the second half and his recast side took
hold of the game. In 71 minutes the dangerous Hugh Ward got the
equaliser when he pushed the ball over the line in a goalmouth scramble.
Six minutes from time it was a Ward cross which provided the chance
for Charlie Gibson to head the winner.

Many believe that Scotland is free of the racial violence so common
elsewhere. Deedee Cuddihy spoke to some people whose experiences jar
with this perception.
SCOTLAND racist? Well, we know the English are racists -- but the
Scots? The people who can go abroad and not look down their noses
(unlike some we could mention) at the ''foreigners'' they find
themselves among? The nation which, despite the xenophobic tendencies of
its southern neighbour, has always put out the welcome mat for others,
whatever their colour or culture?
Or so it is popularly believed. Surely the black American politician
Jesse Jackson wasn't including Scotland when he spoke about racism in
Britain during Channel 4's alternative Christmas Day message?
The sad truth is that while Scotland has never seen a race riot, never
had an apartheid system, and still boasts, in Glasgow, the first public
place in Britain to be named after the now South African President,
Nelson Mandela, acts of racism, both large and small, are taking place
here on a daily basis.
Strathclyde Regional Councillor Neelam Bakshi makes the point that it
is not the black people in Scotland who cause our colour problems, it is
the whites. ''Scotland has a multi-ethnic society,'' she said, ''and
there's no going back on that now, so the sooner we prepare our
children, at home and in school, for life in a multi-cultural
environment, the less racism there will be.''
Derek Goh, an officer with Strathclyde Community Relations Council,
said that in the past six months he and his colleagues had drawn up
reports on 173 cases of alleged racial harassment or discrimination.
''And you have to assume,'' he added, ''that this is just the tip of
the iceberg. An increasing number of people, including the Chinese, are
making complaints to us about racial abuse, but we can't say for sure
whether this is because racism is on the increase in Scotland or because
more people on the receiving end of it are deciding to speak up.
''One of the most distressing cases we've had to deal with recently
concerned a child who was so traumatised by racial abuse that every day
when he came home from school, he'd rush to the bathroom and rub talcum
powder on his face to make his skin look whiter.''
That's a story which would strike a chord with Asha, a 20-year-old
university student from Glasgow, who remembers crying as a small child
because she wasn't white and being told by a disgusted cousin to ''go
and put Nivea cream on your face''.
She recalls an earlier incident when a shopping trip to town was
cancelled because the British National Party was holding a rally. ''When
my parents, who are Indian, explained to me that the BNP didn't like
coloured people,'' she said, ''I replied: 'But they don't know me. How
can they dislike me?'
''My young niece is already experiencing racism. She came back from
nursery one day and said to my mother: 'Granny, I don't like Indians --
they're greasy'.''
These days, Asha is disinclined to ignore apparently unintentional
racist remarks made by white friends and acquaintances. She said: ''I
just won't let them away with saying things like Paki shop or Chinky
carryout. I absolutely hate terms like that. They're pejorative and
there's no disguising the fact.''
Harder to deal with are racist remarks of a sexually threatening
nature which Asha has experienced in recent months while visiting white
friends in an area where few Asian people live. ''On one occasion a man
came up to me and said: 'I've always wanted to ride a black woman', and
in a further incident another complete stranger said: 'I'd love to f***
a gorgeous Paki'.
''In pubs, men will come out with statements like 'I find Indian women
really gorgeous', as if it's a compliment. In fact, I don't find their
remarks the least bit flattering.''
Asha highlighted the unpredictability of racial abuse. Most of its
victims agreed that you can never be sure when and where it will strike
-- or who the perpetrators will be.
ONE male acqaintance, who is white, said he was astonished at the
racist insults an African friend attracted when they walked down a busy
city street together one Saturday afternoon. During their 15-minute
stroll, ordinary-looking men in their late twenties, walking alone,
said, in two separate incidents: ''Get back to your own country'' and
''Black bastard'' loudly enough for others passing by to hear.
Roti, a 13-year-old African boy, who has lived in Scotland most of his
life, said his first encounter with racism came when he was returning
home from primary school one day and a man leaned out the window of a
passing car and made a remark about his skin colour.
''I wasn't upset,'' he recalled. ''Even then I knew that, throughout
my life, I could expect people to say things like that from time to
time.''
Depac, a 20-something musician from Glasgow, does get upset.
Occasionally he responds aggressively, like the time a bus driver kept
pulling away from the kerb when he and his father were trying to get on,
then made a racist remark as they were paying their fares. ''I couldn't
let him treat my father that way,'' he said, ''so I told him to shut up
or step outside for a fight -- and he did shut up.''
But when Depac decided to do some Christmas shopping in Clydebank last
month, and a teenager standing with a group of mates told him to ''go
home'', he said: ''I just laughed it off. He was looking for trouble and
I didn't want to give him that satisfaction.''

THE Royal Bank of Scotland's Citizens Financial Group subsidiary
continues to be a runaway success, with it increasing core earnings in
the December quarter by 82% to $20.9m (#13.4m).
This contrasts with a 34% rise in total assets to $9370m (#6000m)
which arose largely from the three acquisitions during 1994.
Not surprisingly, Citizens chairman Lawrence Fish was able to claim
that these earnings represent the best quarter in the bank's
168-year-old history.
Based in Rhode Island, it has 130 branches in New England and ranks as
the 60th largest bank in the US.
Since it came into the Royal's ownership, it has achieved the
distinction of being the only British-owned bank in America never to
have had a loss.
It expanded the loan book by 33% during the period yet the
non-performing loans amount to just 1.1 % of the total.

ASTONISHINGLY in the present climate of the housing market, CALA Homes
Scotland confidently forecasts an increase of 50% in turnover for its
financial year-end in June. ''We expect the number of homes completed to
be 300, up from 200 in June of last year, and turnover to have risen to
#43m, compared to #30m at the end of our last financial year,'' said
Alan Downie, managing director of CALA Homes Scotland.
An increase in profits is also forecast, and the superb financial
performance is expected to be the crowning glory in a year in which CALA
has distinguished itself in all of its endeavours.
In the past couple of months, CALA has become the first major
housebuilder in the UK to attain ISO 9001, the new quality benchmark
which replaces BS5750 and CALA has been accredited with both parts one
and two, for construction and design.
Alan Downie explained the process by which CALA achieved the new
standard. ''The vast majority of quality companies have gone down the
route towards attainment of ISO 9001, and since we firmly believe in
quality -- there are no magic solutions in this business, our
progression is always achieved by work well done -- we set off to reach
the new quality standards for construction and design. We got there
ahead of our competitors because we rolled our sleeves up and got stuck
in.''
Just weeks after the ISO 9001 achievement, two CALA site managers were
placed in the top 10 in the NHBC's Top 100 UK building industry awards.
Harry Gaughan, site manager at Eaglerise, Dullatur, and Ken Haston, site
manager at Alnwickhill, Edinburgh were the chart toppers, and
subsequently Harry Gaughan secured the coveted No.1 position in the
NHBC's Top 10 site managers in Scotland.
A further accolade from an independent body the following month adds
confirmation to CALA's quality achievements in all aspects of
construction and design. CALA became the first to achieve the Secure by
Design Awards, organised by Strathclyde Police, for their site at
Ralston in Paisley.
CALA designers and architects sat down with specialist security
members of the Strathclyde force, and considered security details, from
windows to passageways close to homes and development lighting, and the
police were not the only people pleased with the CALA development at
Ralston. Last summer #7m worth of homes at Ralston were sold within
weeks, after homebuyers had queued overnight to secure the first homes
released for sale in phase one of the development.
Alan Downie is a confident man, pleased with his company's
performance, anxious to see that all of CALA's employees are given the
credit they deserve for their role in the company's success, and careful
to ensure that their efforts are rewarded. ''We're on a roll, and we
expect the terrific success of last year to continue throughout this
spring and summer,'' he said. ''The figures are up strongly, and
although we tend not to blow our own trumpet too much, the achievements
of the CALA teams have been so outstanding that it is essential that we
capitalise on our success.''
Management at CALA is radical and innovative, a management team of
four run the whole group. ''We don't have departments -- there's no
construction, or sales, or surveying department in CALA. Each project is
handled from construction right through to sales and customer care by a
team, who work together to ensure that our homes are of the best
possible quality and that our customers get the best possible service,''
Mr Downie explains.
The approach to building homes is, in contrast, thoroughly
traditional. Although CALA has gone a considerable way to include all of
the latest marketing thinking in home sales packages, including, for
example, all domestic appliances as American housebuilders do, the basic
product is still the company's strongest selling point.
Expertly designed, soundly constructed, spacious homes with room for
families to grow in the best possible locations are emphasised as the
main selling points. And, recognising that for most people their home is
the major investment, a shrewd eye on the possibility of capital
appreciation ensures that scope for a sound financial gain is built in
with the bricks and mortar.
''This business is land driven,'' Downie points out. ''The received
wisdom in the house sales industry is that there are three crucial
points which determine the underlying value of a property -- location,
location and location. We make it our business to be in the right place
at the right time, build in the middle to up-market range where capital
appreciation has typically been strongest, and our buyers recognise that
as land prices rise, which they inevitably must, then house prices will
rise. Housing is currently a great investment in Scotland.''

THE SNP yesterday renewed its attack on Labour in the row over the
imposition of VAT on domestic fuel.
SNP parliamentary leader Margaret Ewing said Labour had failed to
support her party over a move to reduce the level from 8% to 5%, and
said: ''The public and fuel poverty groups will react with a combination
of amazement and disbelief to the news that Labour passed up a chance of
lowering this hated tax further.''
Her comments followed angry scenes in the Commons on Monday night when
Labour Front Bench spokesman Alistair Darling launched a strongly-worded
attack on the Nationalists.
While the Labour Party opposed the imposition of VAT on fuel, it
argued that the 8% had to be put forward as a technicality, and the SNP
was accused of ''political posturing.''
The SNP's move to bring in a 5% rate was heavily defeated, but it did
attract the support of a number of Labour MPs, seven of whom voted with
the Nationalists.
Mrs Ewing said: ''Labour's performance over VAT on fuel shows that the
issue is just parliamentary theatre as far as they are concerned.

A look back at the controversial career of Mick Newmarch who quit this
week as chief executive of the Prudential Corporation
SUBTLETY is not an attribute that could be applied to Mick Newmarch,
at least in his dealings with the press. In that respect Newmarch, who
up until Monday was group chief executive of Prudential Corporation, the
UK's largest life insurance company, shares a similarity to Sir Richard
Greenbury, the plain-speaking chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer, who is also
physically large.
In the case of Mr Newmarch, his tendency to rub people up the wrong
way has been apparent during the past year as he has campaigned against
the introduction of the Personal Investment Authority (PIA). The PIA is
the self-regulatory body for retail financial services. Mr Newmarch did
not believe that the PIA's approach to regulation was suited to
providing ''adequate and cost-effective saver protection''.
Alone among major companies, the Prudential refused to be regulated by
the PIA, choosing the City's chief watchdog, the Securities and
Investments Board instead. Indeed, Mr Newmarch cited frustration with
the regulatory authorities as the reason for his resignation. It has
since emerged that the London Stock Exchange is questioning dealings in
the company's shares on which he made a pre-tax profit of #200,000.
Mr Newmarch has not been afraid to take the lead or make tough
decisions when necessary in running the Pru. This was demonstrated by
the decision in July 1990, within months of assuming the chief
executive's role, to cut its losses in the difficult estate agency
market and close 175 offices with the loss of 500 jobs.
The company, along with many in the financial services sector, was
badly affected by the downturn in the residential property market which
accompanied the recession. In November 1990, the Pru decided to exit
estate agency all together although it took until May 1991 before the
final batch of 108 agencies were sold. Under Mr Newmarch's stewardship
the company has also withdrawn from loss-making general insurance
broking and troublesome overseas markets.
Following deregulation in the financial services industry, many
companies thought, and many still do, that they could become a one-stop
shop for consumers. Mr Newmarch has preferred to focus attention on
building profitability in the group's core businesses.
The PIA debate is not the only time that the Pru has made a stand. The
company's unilateral decision in November 1992 to change the way it
reports its earnings, to the more transparent ''accruals accounting''
basis, showing for the first time shareholders' interest in the life
funds, earned it many Brownie points in the City.
However Mr Newmarch has attracted controversy among shareholders in
the past over his generous remuneration. In 1990 he received a 43% pay
rise to just over #543,000 in what he described as ''a very rewarding
year'' at a time when the company's pre-tax profits had dropped by
almost 37% to #244m. He has come a long way from his early days in the
Pru when he earned the princely sum of #275 a year. In 1993, the most
recent year for which figures are available, he earned #778,000.
He also upset some of his own staff in 1990 with his decision to axe
the ''man from the Pru'', whose traditional door-to-door visits to the
public established the company's reputation.
Mr Newmarch, 56, is definitely a company man in the sense that his
whole working life has been spent at the Pru. He left his north London
school at 17 to join the Pru as a researcher. He later took an external
economics degree at London University and worked his way up the
organisation. He was promoted to chief executive in April 1990 from the
post of investment director.
His clear focus on growing the Pru's core life and pensions business
in the UK while developing business in new markets in the fast-growing
economies of the Far East, coupled with his generous dividend policy to
shareholders, made him a favourite among City investors.
However, last year the Pru was among insurance groups involved in the
row over providing poor advice to people transferring out of
occupational pension schemes. The company also sacked 23 employees for
falsifying customers' records. It is currently facing industrial
tribunals brought by 450 former employees.
As head of one of the UK's largest institutional investors -- managing
#74bn of funds and owning around 6% of the UK stock market -- and one of
the insurance industry's most prominent figures, Mr Newmarch's departure
has prompted concern in both the City and the industry because of the
lack of an obvious successor.

HOW many battalions would there be in the army of an independent
Scotland, how many frigates in its navy, how many planes in its air
force?
These questions were directed yesterday at SNP leader Alex Salmond by
the Labour MP for East Lothian, Mr John Home Robertson, who is a member
of the Commons Select Committee on Defence.
His interest was aroused by hearing that the SNP had given an
undertaking to the Save Our Infantry Campaign that they would reinstate
the Queens Own Scottish Highlanders and the Gordon Highlanders.
This prompted Mr HomeRobertson to write to Mr Salmond asking a series
of searching questions about the defence force his party envisage for an
independent Scotland.
As well as the number of battalions, ships and planes, he sought
information on how much refit work for the Navy Rosyth dockyard could
expect and the likely level of procurement contracts for defence
equipment for Scottish and other firms.
Mr Home Robertson also posed some more specialised questions. ''How
would you propose to deal,'' he asked, with the financial and physical
problems of nuclear weapons and nuclear-powered submarines, both in
service and laid up, located in Scotland.
''You will be aware that some former Soviet republics are facing
massive responsibilities and costs despite their declared intention to
get rid of nuclear weapons.''
What would happen to Scottish Servicemen in British units not directly
associated with Scotland? ''They will be aware of the predicament of
Ukrainian seamen on Russian vessels in the Black Sea at present.''
There had been suggestions, he said , that Scotland might copy other
small countries which maintain defence forces on comparatively low
budgets by using conscripts.
''I suspect many Scottish teenagers would be interested to know
whether they might face the prospect of two years compulsory' service on
subsistence pay if the SNP were to succeed in breaking up the UK.'' said
Mr HomeRobertson.
Scots who took great pride in the prominent role of Scottish
Servicemen in current miliatry operations, like service in Bosnia, would
be anxious to know that this role would be continued.
Mr Salmond said yesterday he had not yet received the letter, but
commented ''Mr Home Robertson is behind the times. The SNP conference
last September voted to reinstate the two battalions.
''We would have a working conventional naval base at Rosyth with a
prime duty of protecting fishing and oil interests and we would remove
the Trident nuclear presence from Scottish waters as quickly as it could
be negotiated.
''As a member of the Defence Select Committee, Mr Home Robertson
should know that the number of Scottish infantry in the army at present
is around 5000. Denmark has an army of substantially more than that on
which they spend a great deal less per capita than the UK. A Scottish
government would make available Scottish forces for peacekeeping
missions.
''The SNP will be publishing a defence statement before the next
election and I would ask Mr Home-Robertson when the Labour party will be
publishing its own. All we know at the moment is that they would keep
Trident on the Clyde and they want a defence review. They refuse to
answer any other questions.''

An ecological time bomb? Anne Johnstone examines the implications of
chemical weapons dumping
IF there's one threat that strikes more terror into the human heart
than nuclear warfare, it's chemical weapons. This week a chance remark
by a member of the Russian Government suddenly raised that dreadful
spectre again. The Russians are not renowned for their concern for
global ecology so there is likely to be a particular reason when they
start pointing the finger at Britain for the way we tossed 55,000 tonnes
of mustard gas, phosgene and other nasties into the seas off Northern
Ireland and the Outer Hebrides after the Second World War.
And you don't need to be an international defence expert to guess the
Russian agenda. There is already considerable disquiet about a Soviet
submarine scuttled off the Norwegian coast eight years ago. More to the
point, the end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet
Union has left the Russians with between 40,000 and 50,000 tonnes of
chemical agents and nowhere to put them. A number of international
conventions, including the London Convention, now strictly forbid the
dumping of any such material at sea.
No such inhibitions were in force in 1945 when Europe was bristling
with chemical weapons, which had been stockpiled by both Germany and the
Allies but not used during the preceding conflict. In their anxiety to
rid the world of the chemical menace, did the Allies create an
ecological time bomb for future generations of Europeans?
When the Allies entered Germany in 1945 they found the country full of
stockpiles of chemical weapons, a total of 296,103 tonnes. There were 15
different agents, all of them lethal. Around 40% used mustard gas, the
dreadful sulphur and organochlorine compound, which causes horrific
blistering. Mustard gas had killed 100,000 soldiers during the First
World War, and maimed 1.2 million more.
It is said that Hitler's experience of the stuff during the Great War
had filled him with such horror that he resolved never to use it. In
addition, there were large quantities of weapons based on phosgene,
which attacks the lining of the lungs and a smaller quantity of the
deadliest of all chemicals, nerve gas. A pinhead-size amount can cause
paralysis and instant asphyxiation.
What happened after that is only just beginning to emerge. The
Helsinki Commission which monitors environmental concerns among the
Baltic States has been painstakingly piecing together the jigsaw in
recent years, amidst growing concern about what happened to these
chemcials and what may happen.
It appears that the Allies divided them between themselves, each
taking responsibility for what was found in their own respective zones
of occupied Germany. As a result the Soviets ended up with 70,500 tonnes
and the Americans with 93,995 tonnes. By chance the French had to deal
with just 9100 tonnes but the British were landed with 122,508 tonnes.
Around 80,000 tonnes appear to have been burned, but the Allies dumped
the other 215,000 tonnes at sea.
According to Rune Eirksen, who works for Greenpeace in Sweden and is a
member of the Helsinki Commission's working party on dumped chemical
munitions, it had originally been intended to take the weapons far out
into the Atlantic and dump them in very deep water, but the ships
assigned for the job were in such poor condition that it was feared they
would not survive the journey. He said this is why the Russians dumped
58,000 tonnes in the Baltic, most of it near the Danish island of
Bornholm, and a small quantity south of Gotland. ''Cases of munitions
were just thrown into the sea. Some didn't sink and were shot at by
Swedish marines. Others came ashore in Sweden and were buried,'' says
Eriksen.
The British and the Americans sealed most of the weapons assigned to
them into commandeered German warships and scuttled them in the
Skagerrak, the sea lying between Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. Around
22,000 tonnes were dumped in eight ships off Gothenberg and 130,000
tonnes north-west of there, nearer the Norwegian coast. In addition,
around 5000 tonnes was disposed in the strait of Lillebelt near the
north German coast. The British also disposed of some of the French
share of the German weapons.
According to Eriksen, there has been a large number of incidents in
recent years, resulting from the dumping. Denmark alone has dealt with
400 cases in the last decade, mostly concerning fishermen who have
trawled up mustard gas in their nets. Eriksen says: ''Mustard gas is a
liquid which turns solid when it comes into contact with water.
Fishermen trawl up lumps of it and put it into their holds with their
catches. But as soon as it comes into contact with the air it starts to
evaporate and within a couple of hours the fishermen start to suffer
from sore eyes and throats. Then they start to cough. If they don't get
to hospital quickly, they can die. Survivors often develop cancer within
15 years.''
His working party is calling for more research on the corrosive
effects of these chemicals and their effects on the marine environment.
''If this research isn't done we don't know whether or not we're sitting
on a time bomb,'' he said.
A spokeswoman from the Ministry of Defence yesterday seemed rather
vague about Britain's involvement in the sea dumping of chemical weapons
except to say that between July 1945 and 1957 Britain had dumped in
sealed and scuttled cargo vessels an unspecified quantity of mustard
gas, phosgene and nerve gas in three areas: between 50 and 100 miles
west of the Outer Hebrides; 80 miles north-west of Northern Ireland; and
250 miles south-west of Land's End. ''Most were German weapons which had
been stored on mainland Britain,'' she said.
Dr Alastair Hay is chairman of the Working Party on Chemical and
Biological Warfare, supported by the Rowntree Trust. He was considerably
less vague. The dumpings off Scotland and Northern Ireland, were of
Britain's own stickpile of chemical weapons, around 55,000 tonnes of
mustard gas, phosgene and tear gas, he said. In addition, during the
early 1950s we dropped 700,000 German bombs, fueled with more than 6000
tonnes of the nerve agent tabun, into 1000 fathoms of water in the
Atlantic, presumably the third location specified by the MoD.
Hay is a toxicologist but his interest in these terrible substances is
more than academic. His involvement in human rights organisations has
brought him in contact with around 40 mustard gas victims, all of them
Iraqis. His description is horrific. As well as streaming eyes, strange
skin pigmentations and breathing problems, they had developed on certain
parts of their bodies, including the groin and the armpits, massive
ulcers, some of them the size of computer discs.
As well as Russia's stockpile of chemical weapons, America has around
30,000 tonnes. France retains a small stockpile. The Iraqis not only
have it but have used it to devastating effect against the Kurds. The
Iranians are also thought to have it. ''The problem is that it's very
easy to make but very,   very difficult to destroy,'' said Hay.

A Glasgow exhibition is under fire for its display of body bags with
suicide notes in the name of art. Amid calls for a boycott, Mary Brennan
gives her assessment.
BLEAKNESS and despair, illness and suicide have -- like Outriders of
the Apocalypse -- converged on Glasgow's Centre for Contemporary Arts
for a season of Bad Times events that deal in the dark and painful low
points of existence.
It's an audacious way to start any new year. Mostly the yen is to
displace reality -- grotty weather, gruesome bills, a hung-over bank
balance -- with escapist dreams. But since Pollyanna isn't on the staff
at CCA, perennial optimism has been tempered by hard facts. And these
suggest that people are increasingly too stressed and distressed to
enjoy life.
In the Western world, suicide rates are high and rising: on average a
thousand or so invididuals, many of them teenagers, take their lives
every day. A poor exam result . . . a failed business . . . the
breakdown of a relationship . . . simply feeling unloved, or a burden to
others. Whatever the reason, the fear of living eclipses the more usual
fear of dying.
Even those who seem cushioned against the terminal glooms -- the
people with jobs, homes, families and good health -- are apparently
being stricken by a dismal ''feel-bad'' factor. They worry about it all
unravelling, about being at the mercy of circumstances they can't
control because, by now, everybody knows somebody who has hit bad times
through no obvious fault of their own.
But will turning up at the CCA to browse among Suicide Notes -- an
installation by Erika Rothenberg and Tracy Tynan which uses the sorry
words and final phrases of actual suicides -- really appeal to people?
Will live performances about the traumas of having cancer, or personal
sagas of blitzed hope and wasted years, really attract audiences?
Despite the outcry led by Mary Whitehouse, the CCA team think that
yes, For various reasons, Bad Times makes good programming sense.
In the run-up to Saturday's opening, there was an encouraging buzz of
public interest. It's as if this season with its cross-media themes of
misery and misfortune has made it all right for folk to talk about their
own grim experiences, their own sense of apprehension, helplessness and
confusion. Some of this feedback was actively sought by Michael Mayhew
and Becky Edmonds, as source material for their performance piece Die by
Suicide. But outwith their particular project there was a whole range of
responses -- from staff and from members of the public -- that signified
just how deep, and far-reaching, the prevailing mood of despondency is
in our society.
''Is there a homeopathic effect in Bad Times? Well, maybe . . .'' says
exhibitions director Nicola White. ''It could be that people feel better
about their own predicament after seeing some of the work. And we did
think about the after-effects when we were setting things up. But Bad
Times isn't intended to be seen as optimistic. It's not about happy
endings.''
Indeed, unhappy endings are the essence of Suicide Notes. Pinned on to
empty body bags, these (copied) letters act like magnets -- folk pour
over them, as if looking for answers to their own doubts and dilemmas.
Questions of tastelessness and prurience go by the board as the whys and
hows of self-inflicted death become the debatable issues.
Mark Waddell, who programmes the performance events, believes there
can be a kind of melancholy pleasure about despair. Akin, perhaps, to
the curious relief that comes from facing up to devastating news, or
from addressing the fears and insecurities that make peace of mind
impossible.
The various components of Bad Times -- there's video, film (at the
GFT), talks, readings and cafe events as well as the exhibitions and
performances -- acknowledge the darkness that we all carry inside us.

<HEADLINE>Steady decline in red meat eating in UK</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>19</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980189389</RECORDNO>

MARKET commentators at an industry seminar in London yesterday were
unable to disguise the long-term decline of red meat eating in the UK.
The only two bright spots on the horizon unearthed by Meat and
Livestock Commission experts -- the conference organisers -- were the
export and catering markets. But even here, the picture was patchy.
Part of the problem lay in the lack of a ''feel good'' factor among
British consumers, according to Sally Doyle, of the Commission's economy
policy unit. This was due to lower disposable incomes, caused by
inflation and higher taxation, plus job security fears.
Consumers were tending to spend more rather than save, but much of the
spending was directed at so-called durable goods -- fridges, cars,
hi-fi, video recorders, and computers -- rather than on non-durables,
such as food.
And even within this latter sector, consumers were tending to steer
clear of meat and meat products in favour of eye-catching alternatives
such as fresh pasta and pizzas.
''Despite this, the household spend on meat and meat products
increased by 0.7% in 1994. This compared with an increase in the total
spend on food of 2% in 1994. The amount of money we now devote retail to
meat purchases is slightly less than the amount we spend on cigarettes
and other tobacco products, and less than half that which we spend on
alcohol,'' she said.
Even within the meat sector, consumers were generally giving roasts
the cold shoulder in favour of relatively low meat-containing processed
products. Poultry sales remained largely unaffected.
''With the growth in the economy forecast at 3% for 1995, we foresee a
faster growth in the catering sector, with fast food outlets seeing
particularly strong growth.
''Growth in retail sales volumes is expected to continue in 1995.
Growth should also be seen in lamb sales, given the expected greater
availability of lamb on the home market. Pork, bacon, and fresh beef
volume sales are forecast to fall, while unprocessed poultry volumes are
expected to be static.''
Figures produced by chief economist Mick Sloyan bore out the general
downward trend. Between 1991 and the 1995 forecast, British beef and
veal consumption was expected to fall almost 100,000 tonnes to 918,000
tonnes; mutton and lamb by 70,000 tonnes to 353,000 tonnes; and pig meat
by 25,000 tonnes to 399,000 tonnes. At the same time, poultry meat was
due to increase by nearly 70,000 tonnes to 1.2m tonnes.
However, most European countries were expected to demonstrate a
stronger import demand for all three red meat species, with South Africa
also showing a demand for more beef, and Japan for pig meat.

Through the revolving door of history Rabbie turns up in Glasgow,
looking not a day over 37. In an exclusive interview with David Belcher
he explains how he is coping with the twentieth century.
ICANNOT help but watch the flailing figure in the cheap, too-tight
leather jacket as he struggles with the waiter who is trying to huckle
him out through the revolving doors of Glasgow's Cafe Gandolfi.
''Effin' an blindin', it's ma gemme . . . ya wee sleekit, timrous,
cowerin' basssterrt!''
His pinched grey shoes and matching facial pallor seem oddly familiar
and strangely disturbing. My assignation, which had seemed unlikely
enough at the outset, is evidently getting off to a start so bizarre as
to be wholly unimaginable.
I mentally re-run the late-night phone call which had brought me here:
your Ayrshire Bard is alive yet . . . Robert Burns wants a meeting set.
How? Rabbie Burns? Undead for 199 years? Further loud scufflings ended
my reverie.
''Y'effin' sonsie-faced puddin' shite . . . a'm a famous writer, me --
a can pey yur hirelin' traitors' wages!'' Chilling words. Burns alive in
'95 . . . but in such a debased form?
''A've a cheque in the post! An if a get ma boot to ye, ye'll have a
red, red erse!''
Such is my horrified absorption in this spectacle that I entirely fail
to clock the materialisation at my table of an urbane figure in a
stylish four-button tweed suit. When he speaks, his voice is three-parts
Denis Law, two-parts Scottie in Star Trek, one-part Willie McIlvanney.
''Have nib, will travel,'' he drones with quavery gravitas.
I study my new companion's trendy Roman emperor-style haircut and
neatly-trimmed mutton-chop sidewhiskers, his air of no-nonsense
dandification. He doesn't look a day over 37. Yet he had been born 236
years previously -- the heaven-taught ploughman-poet; the drawing-room
dilettante and farmer; the satirical sentimentalist, Robert Burns.
''Immortality's easy when you've tholed half an hour at Rugby Park,''
is Burns' gnomic reply to my obvious first question.
About his life post-death, as it were, Burns is similarly vague. ''I
was away for a long time. Then I went away-away. To the States. I
relocated there, to LA, in 1960-odd. I joined a friend in hopping aboard
a US military transport plane when it called into Prestwick. I'm over
there six months of the year; over here the other six, living somewhere
between Heaven and Kilwinning, let's say.
''I didn't write for literally ages. It was the sixties that got me
going again at the word-face.''
Ah, the era of free love, dissent, and self-expression.
''No, the era of knocking out small amounts of words for big buckets
of wonga, writing TV ad jingles. Let not women e'er complain; Surf
banishes wash-day pain. Lines Written on an Amex Credit Card -- far
safer than a Bank Note, pard'ner! Then I got back into songs again.
Mostly for my own groups. Folk. Folk-rock. Acid-rock. Right the way
through to industrial grindcore and ambient trance. There was the
Houghmagandie Band; Extemporaneous Effusions; Auld Mahoun and the Muckle
Black Deils; Thripplin Thrissle.
''Then it was film music, and ultimately film-writing. Stuff like The
Cotter's Saturday Night Fever; Twa Reservoir Dogs; Halloween. Halloween
is still my favourite: the spell-binding tension, the blood and guts,
the senseless violence, the flash of the stalker's blade . . . the
horror. Aye, and all of it based on a Ayrshire Cup tie between Kilbirnie
Ladeside and Cumnock.''
Ah yes, football. Shake my hand in a scrimpet fashion under this table
and tell me you're not a Rangers man.
''I can honestly say Robert Burns has had no interest in football
since the retirement of his great-great-great grandson, Kenny. Kenny
once told me that he psyched himself up for the on-field fray by nutting
the dressing-room wall . . . he said he could only give of his best in a
game if he had the taste of blood in his mouth. Aye, in his own gritty,
workaday kind of way, Kenny was as much a poet as me.
''As for freemasonry, let me say that when I joined 170 years ago, it
wasn't for bond-holding bourgeois bummles in the Copland Road stand.''
So do you seek weekend entertainment on the dancefloor?
''I visit the Love Boutique at the Arches every month. It's refreshing
to dress up in thigh boots, chamois breeches and lacey ruffles.
Otherwise, I'm not a man for clubs that would have me as a member. As
I've already said, look what happened to the masons.''
How do you get about these days?
''A Mitsubishi Shogun V6 3.5 litre four-by-four with a personalised
number plate, K17 AFF. It's meant to look like 'Kit Aff,' as in 'Haw,
darlin, get yer . . .' An all-terrain vehicle covers much more
galloping-ground in the Ayrshire Tirlie-Whirlie Stakes.''
Ah-ha! Love action! With whom?
''No comment, but it's not John Cairney.''
There are many Burnsian contradictions, leading to contradictory
interpretations of your role and worth. How do you cope with being all
things to all men?
''Easy. The friend with whom I went Stateside has been through it all,
too, exactly the same. We share the burden. And much else besides,
actually . . . not least eternal life.''
What?
''Robert Burns . . . and Elvis Presley. Rabbie still burns and Elvis
lives. Ponder the karmic connections. We both checked in in the same
month, January. We both checked out -- apparently -- after a visit to
the dentist. He signed off -- ostensibly -- by singing Auld Lang Syne at
the end of 1976. And where was the one place he touched down in Britain?
''I've been writing songs for him. Country and western. Aye, when
you're talking about country and western, simple couplets,
sentimentality, deathless love, and cheatin' hearts . . . well,
songwriters don't come any more country and western than me.''
Our conversation winds to an end. We bid each other adieu, exiting
Cafe Gandolfi together, carefully avoiding the ejected trouble-maker
whose rage continues in the street.
''For auld lang's effin syne, it's Francie an' effin' Josie,'' the
leather-jacketed cries upon seeing us.
Burns stops. Considers. ''Return to sender, pal. I did bawdy demotic
150 years ago. Get a new act. Get contemporary. Like me.''

RODGER Vignoles, a pianist versed in the ways of Schumann's songs,
proved a welcome contributor to the latest of Edinburgh's New Town
concerts, in which he joined the Brindisi String Quartet in an
unbuttoned but not insensitive account of that composer's great Piano
Quintet, Op 44.
The song-like passages that flower within all Schumann's pieces of
chamber music were nurtured in a manner that drew attention to their
beauty without seriously impeding the progress of each movement. The
sturdy march rhythms, fast or slow, on which so much of the work is
based, formed a framework for the expression of other, more poetic
things. But there was vitality too. The hurtling scherzo was, as it
should have been, an exhilarating, clattering intermezzo.
Though neither here nor in Mozart's G Minor Piano Quartet at the start
of the programme was the playing invariably a model of tidiness -- the
Queen's Hall is not the easiest of places for the merging of piano and
string tone -- the sense of line bestowed upon each work provided ample
compensation.
As the evening's centrepiece there was a terse, strong account of
Bartok's Third String Quartet, its four sections riveted together in a
way that emphasised the work's steely structure without concealing the
mysteriously rustling sonorities, the unexpected little touches of
sweetness, that lie within this seemingly thorny score.

AS appropriate when dealing with matters of sleaze, one enters the
Nolan Committee via the back-door; albeit the back-door of the Methodist
Central Hall at Westminster. In a room of no particular distinction, the
nation's ''standards in public life'' are being stripped bare. At least,
that's the theory.
I spent a while there yesterday morning, in honour of the fact that Mr
John MacGregor, former Secretary of State for Transport was giving
evidence. He proved to be an amusing, if decidedly unseductive, cabaret
turn as the Good and the Great with Lord Nolan questioned him
chap-to-chap about MPs' business interests.
The humour lay in his determination to preach the virtues of outside
interests. Not once, but a dozen times, he referred to the importance of
getting ''good people'' into Parliament, and how this could only be
achieved if MPs had a free rein to top up their meagre salaries with
directorships and consultancies. I do not summarise unfairly.
Any restrictions on the right to do so would deter the ''good people''
from putting themselves forward, he argued, and Parliament would be
poorer for their absence.
''We will only have ourselves to blame,'' he declared solemnly, ''if
high-calibre young people of the future are not prepared to make a
contribution as MPs to our public life.'' Mr MacGregor's clarion call to
young Tories was enough to bring a tear to a glass-eye.
The motto would appear to be: ''Ask not what your country can do for
you, but what you can do for your country, so long as you're allowed to
work as a lobbyist and consultant on the side.''
One imagined the long lists of applicants for every vacant Tory seat
being stripped down to a few low-calibre inadequates who were prepared
to subsist on #33,000 a year, while the present breed of great men shook
their heads in dismay and turned their backs on the frugalities of
Westminster.
On the aspect of his evidence which I had gone to hear, Mr MacGregor
was falling over himself to justify his own rapid transition from
Secretary of State for Transport to the deputy chairman of Hill Samuel,
a merchant bank which is reaping a merry harvest from the same Mr
MacGregor's rail privatisation programme.
It was ''essential'', he insisted, for ministers to be able to take on
this kind of job, because of the drop in income they would otherwise
suffer on ceasing to be ministers. This would further deter ''good
people'' -- a category in which he presumably includes himself -- from
being ministers, far less MPs. Obvious, isn't it?
In reality, it is difficult to imagine that his Hill Samuel salary is
less than double what his ministerial one was. But nobody asked him.
Disappointingly, the committee also failed to ask him about pensions.
In this branch of the Establishment Club, that would have been regarded
as far too personal, not to say political, a question. Yet it is one
which might have opened up an interesting avenue of inquiry.
Apparently expecting to be tackled on such a matter, he complained
about the low pensions available to MPs as a further justification of
outside interests. Yet a quick calculation suggested that, at the age of
65, he will be on a parliamentary pension of around #16,000 a year.
Mr MacGregor, in his role as defender of the Westminster marketplace,
was also adamant that MPs should be able to work for lobbying firms, so
long as they acted as ''advisers'' rather than ''advocates'' -- a
distinction which appeared to test even the Great and Good minds of Lord
Nolan's little helpers.
He assured them that he had never been influenced by lobbyists, even
when (as in the Ebbsfleet affair) senior Tories were on the lobbying
firm's pay-roll and it was boasting of its inside-track contacts with
Tory Ministers.
On this matter at least, Mr MacGregor seemed to have arrived a little
late at the Nolan Committee, since his lordship -- after hearing the
Ebbsfleet evidence alone -- had last week announced the interim
conclusion that there is a need for ''much better guidance on what is
and what is not acceptable'' in the lobbying trade.
Gentlemen don't shoot at sitting ducks, at least indoors, and the
level of questioning was pretty pathetic. But the message which came
from Mr MacGregor is one which the Nolan Committee will have to
adjudicate on. Either there is a free market in MPs and former ministers
or there isn't. On yesterday's showing, I have high hopes of Lord Nolan
but precious few of his committee.
What struck me about Mr MacGregor's evidence was its separation from
what I would regard as the real world. He seems to represent a segment
of society in which anybody on less than a six-figure income is slumming
it.
In other words, he is -- and was yesterday -- the ideal spokesman for
the Tory Party of the 1990s, which seems to believe that boardroom
salaries, share options, and such deals can be justified in the name of
''the market''. It is a world which many less privileged Tory voters are
becoming as sick of as everyone else.

THE second Celtic Connections festival, which finished at the weekend,
has chalked up a huge success for its promoters, the Glasgow Royal
Concert Hall. Attendances and box office returns have gone through the
roof, firmly establishing the viability of a folk festival and sweeping
aside any lingering scepticism. Around 120 performances in the main
auditorium and Strathclyde Suite, as well as in the Hospitality Inn,
drew a total attendance of 55,000, more than 20,000 increase on the
first Celtic Connections in 1994. Box office takings this year rose by a
spectacular #140,000 to over #300,000. Celtic Connections, said a Royal
Concert Hall spokesman yesterday, is here to stay.

SPEAKER Betty Boothroyd yesterday declared that she would defend the
Palace of Westminster with her ''last breath'' to prevent it ever being
converted into a hotel or office block.
She told cheering MPs she would be first at the barricades to
''safeguard it as it stands''.
Earlier, yesterday Chancellor Kenneth Clarke had disclosed he was
putting the Treasury refurbishment plan -- estimated to cost #100-#200m
-- forward as a candidate for a public/private partnership.
The grand Portland stone building, which forms one side of Parliament
Square and fronts onto Whitehall, has serious structural problems,
including flooding in the basement.
The reward for shouldering the cost and risk of providing new
high-tech office accommodation will be around half of the site to turn
into a prestige office block commanding premium rents.
Mr David Winnick, (Walsall North -- Lab) asked the Speaker for
''reassurance that we will not find one of these days that the building
is being privatised like the Treasury building over the road''.
To cheers, she replied: ''From time to time there are many of us who
complain about this building, the fact that we don't have sufficient
accommodation or that it isn't as modern as we would like.
''But at the end I would defend this building with my last breath and
I will be first at the barricades to safeguard it as it stands.''

The London scene: Carole Woddis reports on the popularity of
Strinberg, and how theatre-land is split between the old and new.
THERE'S an accidental Strinberg festival going on in London at present
with five different plays on in various venues. His popularity is not
hard to understand: in his torment and guilt, Strinberg seems to have
found a line directly into our post-Freudian angst on the sex war and
modern marriage. His plays may be barbed and bitter but he's very much
our contemporary.
We may not like the way he poses his voracious, nagging wife against
the cold, manipulative Army captain in The Dance of Death (at the
Almeida Theatre). We may shudder at the way both inveigle a mutual
friend Kurt into their clutches -- she by a headlong sensuality, he by
the oldest of ''buddy'' manoeuvres, soul baring in the face of
apparently imminent mortality. We can't help though but recognise the
awful truth of it and the games people play, now as then.
Certainly, Swedish director Peter Stormare in Michael Meyer's subtle
translation makes it all seem very immediate though his way is to stress
Strinberg's redemptive rather than ferocious qualities. Using the
Almeida's bare brick walls to their fullest, the production works on
subtle, almost elegiac notes though it is not without a cruelly surreal
kind of humour.
John Neville's Edgar is a lightweight, languid where he might be
bullish, but he is quite marvellous at edging towards spiritual
awareness while making you realise his duplicity. Beside him, Gemma
Jones's magnificent, tethered Alice dies a thousand deaths in a piercing
scream that echoes down the century, through Sartre's Huis Clos and
Munch's famous painting The Scream. Hell, it seems, is a mutually
destructive marriage from which there is no escape.
LONDON theatre is also split between the gory shock of the new and
comfortably, if newly upholstered, safety of the old. After giving
Patrick Hamilton's psychological thriller Rope a hefty injection of
nineties gay chic Keith Baxter, in his second Chichester season
transfer, has now imbued something of the same iconic quality into bluff
old J B Priestley.
Set in a similar world of flapper modes and emotions (handsomely
encompassed in Simon Higlett's dazzling white and chrome set), Dangerous
Corner (at the Whitehall Theatre), smarts with moral indignation. In the
background, and dominating the action from a full-length portrait, is a
beautiful youth who apparently shot himself for reasons no-one is quite
sure about but which gradually come to implicate everyone.
In the foreground, his brother, sister-in-law, and various weekend
dinner guests unexpectedly find themselves confronted with some
unpalatable truths about him (an irretrievable cad and charismatic
bisexual) and themselves, that leaves most of them changed, not
necessarily for the better.
So much for the virtues of honesty and truth-telling, Priestley seems
to be saying: you play with it at your peril. In a typically mischievous
final twist too, Priesley suggests that truth is at best an ephemeral
quality. One moment the chance to open the lid on ''the truth'' is
there, the next the lid is banged shut, the opportunity gone.
It's a creaky old vessel and Baxter's star-studded line-up -- Jean
Boht, Gayle Hunnicutt, Susan Penhaligon, Christopher Timothy, and Baxter
himself -- go through their paces as stiffly as a bunch of
newly-starched dress shirts. For all that, Baxter's sense of elegant
decay and Priesley's own delight in pulling apart the social facade
makes an absorbing enough evening.
FUNNY the way things fall out. Just as ex-Monty Python Terry Jones's
new series about the Crusades breaks surface on the BBC, up pops The
Wrestling School (at the Riverside Studios) in a revival of Howard
Barker's The Castle, a deeply cynical look at institutionalised
Christianity, patriarchy, power, and the enduring fascination/fear of
the male for the female, seen through the eyes of a returning Crusader.
Ten years ago the play appeared in a short-lived RSC production which
none the less won Harriet Walter a best actress award for her role as a
made-over lesbian wife discovering the possibilities of a new female
world order.
Kenny Ireland's Wrestling School honestly recapture the monumentalism
of Barker's ambition. You can't say fairer than that, though for my
taste, Ireland's treatment is a tad heavy handed. The Wrestling School
is, of course, entirely dedicated to presenting the works of Barker, a
writer who for 25 years has split audiences down the middle. Either you
love him, practically hail him as the dramatic messiah, or find yourself
impressed but exasperated by him.
I tend towards the latter category but was still utterly intrigued by
the scale and imaginative sweep of The Castle even if Ireland's monotone
treatment curiously dulls the potency of the women's vision and
therefore heightens Barker's ambivalence. Is he laughing at the women as
much as the men? Hard to say, but it's an intoxicating evening all the
same with Jennie Stoller in the Harriet Walter role, revelatory as the
prophetic and sardonic Skinner. The Castle is but one of three plays The
Wrestling School are currently touring through Europe. It is at the
Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh, May 3-6.

<HEADLINE>CAP reforms 'good for Scottish agriculture'</HEADLINE>

THE reform of the Common Agricultural Policy has laid down principles
which should endure into the next century, Mr Sandy Mole, Scottish NFU
vice-president, told the union's Angus area annual general meeting.
The new CAP deal was good for Scottish agriculture, he said. It was
about reducing consumer prices, and supporting farm incomes. It had also
brought an end to unpopular food mountains.
Europe's farmers had to fight hard to have the MacSharry CAP proposals
scrapped, he recalled. MacSharry would have targeted aid on the
Continent's smaller-sized farms, and cut Scottish farm incomes by #70m.
''We don't accept the Trustee Savings Bank's reported view that we
should prepare for a resources transfer on this scale from Scotland,''
he said. ''It would discriminate against our farmers, and place them at
a massive competitive disadvantage.''
The Scottish NFU kept its finger on the pulse of agricultural policy
developments in Europe, said Mr Mole. ''Despite endless speculation in
the United Kingdom, there are no political moves in Brussels to make yet
more fundamental changes to the CAP. On the Continent, CAP reform is
regarded as a success story.
''The Scottish NFU will continue to play a full and active part in the
evolving CAP policy debate. I hope that bankers will devote a little
more time in future to reducing the unnecessarily high costs they impose
on the farming industry.''
* AFTER a deep slump in prices, an improvement in profits for pig
producers is likely from springtime onwards, according to Dr David
Kitchen, pig feed manager with feed compounders AF. He advises producers
to investigate new outlets for better prices, by selling stores and
finished pigs through a professional marketing organisation.
''It's the way the Continentals do it, and they are the UK's stiffest
competition -- not the farmer down the lane,'' he said. Modern breeding
techniques could achieve 28 live piglets per sow, and have 24 to sell
each year at a growth rate of 950 to 1000 grammes a day, with 90%
reaching top grades.
''If you are nowhere near reaching these targets, you need to be
taking advice on feeding and management.''
* JUDGES at the Perth bull sales next month will be: Aberdeen-Angus,
Bob Crockatt, Forfar; Shorthorn, John H Tilson, Gordon, Berwickshire;
Limousin, Richard Oates (Lumbylaw Ltd), Oxnam, Jedburgh; Simmental,
Peter Scott, Balmanno Farms, Bridge of Earn; Charolais, Ray Holmes,
Ploughfield Farms Ltd, Uckfield, East Sussex.
* SCOTSHEEP '95 -- a one-day event organised by the Scottish Region of
the National Sheep Association in association with the Scottish
Agricultural College -- will be held at Westruther, Gordon,
Berwickshire, on May 26. More than 80 trade stands have already been
reserved, and Mr Hamish Lohoar, chairman of NSA Scotland, forecasts that
this year's event will be one of the best ever.
The event is expected to attract more than 5000 sheep farmers from all
over Scotland and the north of England.
* THE Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has
appealed to all Scottish MPs to support calls for a ban on the export of
calves destined for veal crates on the Continent. The SSPCA view is that
export of calves for the veal trade, although legal, is morally
repugnant. Any assessment of a potential ban must take account of public
morality, as well as legal and economic factors, they say.
The society argues that the economic implications of a unilateral ban
could be overcome through the establishment of a welfare-friendly
British veal industry, and the further development of the UK's export
trade in ''plain'' beef.
SSPCA chief executive Jim Morris said: ''Clearly, the long-term
solution is to bring the rest of the European Union up to UK standards,
but that would take years to achieve, and in the meantime calves would
continue to suffer in crates. In the short term, we must prevent this
suffering, by banning the export of calves destined for veal crates.
''I am hoping that public support for this campaign will continue and
increase until the Government realises that this issue is not simply
going to go away.''
* THE English NFU has called on the Chancellor to re-consider his
plans to abolish exemption from vehicle excise duty for vehicles used
only for short journeys on the public highways -- up to six miles a week
use between different parcels of land owned by the same farmer.
Sir David Naish, union president, said: ''This is a misconceived
proposal, because many farm vehicles travel relatively short distances
at any one time.'' He pointed out that combine harvesters, sprayers, and
spreaders, were used only seasonally.
''The benefit in terms of revenue is likely to be out of all
proportion to the extra administrative burden and costs to the
farmers,'' he said.
Sir David also called for the 100% agricultural relief for inheritance
tax to be applied to the tenanted sector. At present, let land qualifies
for 50% relief. Key objectives must be to encourage landlords to re-let
when land became vacant, and to give new entrants the chance to start
their own farm businesses.

When violinist Anthony Marwood commissioned a concerto from composer
Sally Beamish he suggested she draw on a classic anti-war text. Michael
Tumelty spoke to her about the finished piece, which premieres tomorrow
in Glasgow.
COMPOSERS draw their inspiration from unlikely sources: Beethoven and
his idealised vision of Napoleon; Shostakovich and his contempt for
totalitarianism; Messiaen and his bird song. And so on.
Even so, Sally Beamish confessed herself surprised when violinist
Anthony Marwood, having asked her to write him a violin concerto, then
sent her a book and said: ''How about this for the concerto?''
The book was the classic novel on the horror of war by Erich Maria
Remarque, All Quiet on the Western Front, which initially left Sally
Beamish bemused.
''But then I read it and agreed,'' she said. What struck her were the
strong, vivid contrasts in the book. ''The story is written in episodes;
there are powerful, angry descriptions of war -- horrific, and so ugly.
''And these are contrasted with beautiful passages, for example when a
young boy with no real experience of life outside the war imagines, in
descriptive, wistful passages, what it might be like. The language is
beautiful and poetic, even in translation.''
The new violin concerto, whose commission was taken up by the BBC,
will receive its world premiere in Glasgow's City Hall tomorrow with the
BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and Anthony Marwood as soloist. Marwood
and Sally Beamish go back a long way: he is first violin in the Raphael
Ensemble, the string sextet of which Beamish was a co-founder in the
early eighties.
Unusually for Beamish, whose music tends to be continuous, her violin
concerto is cast in three movements. They are inspired by key passages
in the book, and are intended to be graphic, though, she says, there is
no specific narrative. ''The first movement reflects a battlefield scene
with shelling, in which the soldier throws himself into the ground: the
image is of the earth as his mother, cradling him.
The second movement, she explains, is more straightforward. ''There is
a description in the book of a Russian funeral in a prisoner-of-war camp
in which a violinist is playing folk songs while others hum with him.''
The movement reflects this with a Russian Orthodox funeral hymn on
trombones, and the violinist coming in with a folksy tune.
The finale is a march: ''militaristic, a nightmare of noise, manic and
incessant'', designed to portray futility. The movement contains
fragments of a German folk song, again inspired by a passage in the book
where soldiers find themselves in an abandoned cottage singing a folk
song: ''an escape into an unreal peace,'' says Sally Beamish.
The concerto ends with an effect like a record stuck in a groove, a
sort of endless parade: ''marching until they're dead''.
Appropriately, Sally Beamish's concerto will be coupled with another
sort of concerto, also featuring martial music: Harrison Birtwistle's
Endless Parade, where the soloist will be the Fife-born principal
trumpeter of the Philharmonia and soloist par excellence, John Wallace.
The aptness of the match goes beyond any musical similarities. When
Beamish's violin concerto was half-finished, she took the score to Sir
Harrison Birtwistle. ''He said some interesting things; that he thought
I could be more adventurous, that there was lot more there than I was
finding -- almost as though I was using the wrong language.''
What Birtwistle was criticising, specifically, seemed to be the fact
that, for a piece that was trying to depict chaos, the textures were too
clear. (And clarity is a feature of Beamish's music.)
Anyway, it didn't mean much to her until she went to see Birtwistle's
opera Gawain. And she saw exactly what he had meant. ''I went home and
totally rewrote the concerto after that. It's much more complex, with
lots of layering and different colours.'' And, she hopes, more
appropriate to the original inspiration in Remarque's book, ''with its
contrast of an unhealthy stillness and a chaotic mood''.
* BBC SSO plays Beamish and Birtwistle, City Hall, Glasgow, tomorrow
night at 7.30pm.

EXPECT the unexpected in David Leveaux's dark-edged and revealing
production of Mozart's Marriage of Figaro, which opened last night. It's
not that it isn't funny: sung in English, in Jeremy Sams's witty and
racy translation it is often very funny indeed. And the laughs come from
the text rather than sight gags. Which says something for the balance of
orchestral and vocal ensembles. Vocal clarity, in this production, is at
a premium.
But, just as he opened an emotional can of worms in his spellbinding
production of Turn of the Screw for Scottish Opera at the Tramway,
Leveaux turns over the elegant stone of Mozart's opera and reveals a
discomforting turmoil of passions, selfishness and obsession. Everyone
is at it. A dark pantomime during the overture encapsulates the whole
thing; coupling, groping, self-serving. Forget your classical elegance;
we are talking carnal here.
It's an impression that suffuses Vicki Mortimer's lofty, russet-hued
set, with its assymetrical scattering of furniture and costume dummies,
and Paul Pyant's sympathetic lighting design which produces a stark,
almost shocking effect to the final apparently harmonious resolution.
(And I stress again, unless you are a stony-faced reactionary, it is
also extremely funny: darkness and light are siblings.)
And, (go for broke here; many will disagree) I think that this is one
of Scottish Opera's most courageous castings. They are mostly young,
some are relatively untried, three -- Paul Whelan as a sonorous Figaro,
Claire Bradshaw as an urchin-like Cherubino, and Claire Rutter's
restrained Countess -- are making their Scottish Opera debut. The
strength of the whole team, even on first night, was the ensemble: firm
and clear, well-paced under conductor Nicholas McGegan, with the band
sounding like a period outfit. Recitatives need to be snappier,
Otherwise, good stuff. See it.

THE Prime Minister made a big pitch yesterday for the votes of high
street shopkeepers who are lagging behind in economic recovery. He
promised to sweep away another tranche of burdensome regulations that
hinder their trading.
He said the Government was reviewing all laws affecting business aimed
at generating a ''radical shift in power'' to retailers and away from
council regulators.
However, he also wanted to make life simpler for everyone by cutting
through unnecessary rules.
Sunday licensing laws are to be changed again south of the Border to
bring them more into line with the Scottish scene. Mr Major proposes
that supermarkets will be able to sell liquor throughout the six hours
they may open on Sundays.
Smaller off-licences will be able to trade from 10am till 10.30pm. The
compulsory afternoon break on Sundays, when pubs in England now have to
close from three o'clock to seven o'clock, will be abolished.''
On December 1, Scottish law was changed to permit sales of drink from
off-sales outlets on Sundays from 12.30pm to 10pm. Hotels and pubs'
official hours remain from 12.30 to 2.30 with a close until 6.30pm,
reopening thereafter until 11pm, but most have afternoon and late-night
extensions.
In a speech to the Retail Consortium dinner in London last night, Mr
Major said: ''The present law on sales of liquor on Sunday is absurd.
They are old-fashioned, out of date, patronising, Government-knows-best
restrictions. And they should go.''
He also confirmed that greyhound punters will have the same betting
benefits as racehorse punters. They will be allowed to bet through the
Tote from one greyhound track to another.
A punter at the Glasgow Shawfield greyhound track will be allowed to
place bets on races taking place simultaneously at the Edinburgh
Powderhall track.
The Prime Minister also announced that high street regulations about
parking are to be changed to allow retailers to be at least consulted
before local authorities impose wheel- clamping, parking meters and
double yellow lines.
Mr Major said he wants to make life simpler for people who want to
hire community buildings, like village halls, for the night with a
liquor licence. ''We mean to combine licence applications and reduce
inspection visits.'' This, he said, should be a real help to local
groups like charities, playgroups, women's institutes.
The Prime Minister also announced a new break for charities who have
been campaigning for the law to be changed about how they invest their
money. ''I can tell you tonight that the Home Secretary will shortly act
to increase the proportion of money charities can invest in equities
from the present 50% limit, to 75%. On the charities' own figures, this
simple change could boost their income by up to #200m a year.''
Mr Major's speech, in which he promised again that there will be
income tax cuts, is a further step in his tactical shift to prepare the
Tories for the next General Election, despite the fact that it might
still be two years away.
He declared that unemployment is falling dramatically with job
vacancies increasing, and not only that, 70% of new jobs are now
full-time. His speech coincided with new statistics indicated that UK
growth is proceeding fast at nearly 4% a year. Now, he told the
retailers, ''there is good reason for consumer confidence to return more
strongly''.
* A spokesperson for Glasgow-based Italian food specialists Fazzi Bros
Ltd welcomed Mr Major's plans to give retailers a say in planning
restrictions affecting their business.
He claimed the business, which comprises a delicatessen, basement
restaurant and a wholesale supply section, had its Christmas ruined, he
claimed by the erection of bollards outside.
The bollards were meant to corrall traffic for the adjacent St Enoch's
Centre car park into one lane, but had the additional effect of blocking
off access to the Clyde Street premises.
''Our business depends upon people being able to park their vans
outside for easy loading,'' said the spokesperson. ''We were hit
extremely hard by the restrictions.''

Reports of the death of couture have been greatly exaggerated . . .
but a transfusion of fresh blood certainly would not go amiss. Francesca
Fearon finds that the latest Paris collection harks back to past decades
of style and vitality
EACH July during the Paris haute couture collection an embossed
invitation would arrive by messenger from the Chambre Syndicale asking
the recipient to its annual cocktail party. The name beautifully written
in scrolled handwriting at the top of the invitation was Madame Gres,
the Honorary President of this powerful organisation, which has
regulated couture and ready-to-wear since 1972.
Last summer the name was absent, but it wasn't until last month that
the reason became apparent. This tiny, turbanned, enigmatic figure who
seldom spoke to the press and rarely permitted a photograph, had died.
The couturier, who founded her house in 1934 and made her name with
Grecian-style dresses in draped jersey (which inspired many of the
Italian designers for their summer 1994 collection), had one of the
longest careers in fashion, spanning 50 years. Yet remarkably her
daughter Anne was able to conceal news of her death for more than a year
and, it is reported, had been reluctant to have her mother buried during
that time.
Some people would choose to draw parallels with the viability of
couture. The death of couture was presumptously reported at the start of
the recession. However, this extraordinary exhibition of craftsmanship
refused to be buried, which is fortuitous given that the skills of the
couturiers of the forties and fifties have inspired a remarkable revival
in glamorous tailoring and bias-cut eveningwear of that era.
John Galliano's highly-praised ready-to-wear spring collection was
likened to couture in both quality and style. So insiders were not
surprised to hear rumours that the British designer has been offered
Hubert de Givenchy's role as creative director at Givenchy on the
latter's expected retirement after the July couture collections.
The house is now owned by LVMS (along with Dior and Lacroix) and must
be looking to its future. Richard Simonin, the couture managing
director, says an announcement will be made in March, although he wants
de Givenchy, 66, whose client list included Audrey Hepburn and Jackie
Onassis to stay. Whatever the outcome, a future in couture for Galliano
is a sure bet.
The rumour mill, though, does come up with some odd marriages of
creativity. Now that the breach-of-contract battle has been settled
between Christian Lacroix and Patou (LVMH tempted the designer away with
the offer of his own house), word has it that Jean-Paul Gaultier has
been asked to design for Patou. There is undoubtedly a mood for fresh
blood in couture (the Lagerfeld and Chanel link-up has been a brilliant
success), but new ideas also emerge from designers like Versace and
Valentino who are renowned for their ready-to-wear yet have a natural
instinct for couture.
Ironically, Versace's spring couture collection was a homage to the
heyday of couture during the fifties with a polka-dot sack dress,
knee-length pencil skirts and slashed-neck crepe dresses which formed a
simple backdrop to huge gold brooches on thigh and shoulder bone.
Glove-fit tailoring is what the couture customer pays for and
Valentino's tiny boucle boleros were shrugged on over impeccably-shaped
tunics that made a feature of intricate darting to mould the body.
Scooped necklines cupped the bosom of the lithe supermodels who paraded
his clothes and fluted skirts kissed their knees. Black lace, silver
satin and printed chiffon were intricately tucked and swathed to flaunt
their figures. Huge, silvery silk opera cloaks added drama. The show had
the gloss and glamour of Hollywood, but with Claudia Schiffer, Elle
MacPherson and Nadja Auermann as the new screen sirens.
At Nina Ricci, Gerard Pipart proved that eveningwear is his forte with
a group of ballgowns slit to reveal ruffled minis in a rainbow of fruity

J-L Scherrer's roaring 20s shimmy dresses, inspired by Twiggy in The

MICK MARTIN'S drama is the fourth production by the Ramshorn New
Playwrights Initiative in association with Strathclyde Theatre Group and
has the honour of being the first new play to open in Glasgow this year.
Let's hope it is symbolic of what's to come; confident, intelligent, and
superbly acted work.
More performance piece than dialogue-driven drama, with precise
physicality and a bold use of music, it none the less boasts a cracking
script. Three actors skilfully people a bare white stage with a teeming
cast of characters, continually stepping back from the action to flesh
out their parts with entertaining third-person narratives.
Director Ben Francombe has wisely opted for an uncluttered, minimally
designed production which focuses on the compelling rhythms of Martin's
prose. This wrestles intriguing new perspectives from what could so
easily be a well-worn theme; interracial love, with Pank, a
quasi-skinhead, forced to confront his nationalistic leanings when he
falls hook, line and sinker for an Asian shopgirl.
Nik Wardzynski is an animated and totally compelling Pank. Despite his
aggressive image he is a gentle soul, easily manipulated by his best
mate Frank -- John Comeford bringing a chilling combination of charm and
venom. Sharon Shrubsall is equally convincing in her conflicting roles
as the young girl Asia, and the fascist Hank, a lacklustre member of the
skinhead triumvirate.
The play's greatest strength is that, while the performances are
entertainingly exuberant, -- from Whigfield bopping to Jill Dando
imitations -- Martin's exploration is restrained; there are no grand
passions, no heroic actions, no Damascus conversions, just an
understated but affirming picture of pragmatism, with simple deeds
triumphing over empty words and values.

Ross Finlay tries out the Nissan 200SX
IT happens from time to time that some sporting car gets rave reviews
from fast-driving critics, builds up a kind of cult following, but then
has its manufacturers wondering if specialist approval is really the way
to volume sales. They ''soften'' the car a little, to appeal to a wider
potential ownership -- and the writers who praised it in the first place
rain down curses on the manufacturers' heads.
That, briefly, is the story of the Nissan 200SX. There is no doubt
about its level of performance. The two-litre turbocharged engine peaks
at 200bhp, a considerable advance over the previous 1.8-litre model. It
will streak to 60mph in less than seven seconds, the company's claimed
time for this sprint being unduly modest, and it can touch a test track
maximum on the high side of 145mph.
Some testers complain that it is not so good accelerating from low
revs in high gears, but come on! Like all turbocharged cars, it pays the
penalty for having that system when you try to accelerate it from an
off-boost engine speed. You want top-class acceleration all the way
through the range? Use the box.
On the other hand, motorway cruising at legal speeds is achieved when
the turbo unit is contributing little. So official fuel consumption
figures like 39mpg at 56mph, 32 at 75 and 20mpg around town are a fair
trade-off.
To appeal to more and not necessarily such sporting customers, the
present 200SX has increased ''driveability'. Unlike many of its rivals,
the Nissan coupe is a rear-drive design, but where the original version
played up to that in terms of handling feel, the new car has a smoother
power train, a noticeably better ride, and one of the best turbo
installations in the business. The boost comes in almost seamlessly. I
agree with one of my colleagues who admitted that at times, when he was
driving the Nissan, he forgot it was turbocharged altogether.
Instead of going for a sportier appearance, the designers of the
current 200SX preferred a more rounded, GT rather than sports car body
line. I thought it looked fine, although admittedly reminiscent of some
earlier styles. The panel fit and body finish on the test car were
flawless, and there are some very neat touches, like the treatment of
the high-level brake lights just below the rear spoiler.
Accommodation is spacious in front, but strictly occasional in the
rear, where legroom and headroom are both well short of the best in the
class. The boot is bigger than it looks at first, thanks to an inner
shelf. Nissan's fascia material is rather dull, and there is no
pulse-racing appeal in the fairly cold cabin presentation, although the
layout is good. All-round visibility is well up to requirements, and one
feature not often seen is that the rear wiper has both constant and
intermittent settings.
The firmly upholstered seats were leather trimmed, which showed that
the test car had the touring pack -- also including a second airbag and
a neat CD player -- which comes at a premium price of #19,995. You pay
#1200 less for the standard specification.
There is a time-sensitive alarm and immobiliser system which made me a
little nervous when I left the car unlocked, with a passenger in it. The
fuel gauge, which moved off full only after 180 miles, was useless, and
I thought the radio was too complicated and fussy.
Oddly enough, then, the items on the 200SX with which I was not over
impressed are details which Japanese manufacturers usually manage very
well. Conversely, what I really liked -- the blistering performance if
you want to tap it, the excellent ride for a sporting car, the
flexibility and the way the turbocharger blends unobtrusively in -- are
things we sometimes think of as coming within the European sphere of
expertise.

THE Commons last night backed the Government's package to combat
discrimination against the disabled.
The Bill will make it unlawful for employers to discriminate on the
grounds of disability and will introduce new rights of access for
disabled people.
Referring to changes needed to assist access for the disabled,
Minister for the Disabled Mr William Hague said: ''We expect that the
cost in the case of goods and service providers will run into hundreds
of millions of pounds. We do have to recognise that and not just wish
away the fact that it is an additional cost for many people.''

CLAD in purple velvet, elegant and distinguished, guitarist John
Williams last night joined the Royal SNO for a combined concerto and
recital programme which revealed once again the sublime technique of
this virtuoso musician. Australian-born, Williams opened with a piece by
the young Australian composer Nigel Westlake. Antartica -- a suite for
guitar and orchestra -- drawn from Westlake's award-winning film score,
captures the spirit of the Antartic landscape.
In four contrasting sections, Williams painted an evocative landscape
from the chilling introduction through the graceful and lyrical journey
of the early travellers in their wooden boats and the mad behaviour of
penguins, to the powerful conclusion contemplating the destruction of
the ozone layer. .
The remainder of the first half was filled by a dazzling account of
Gershwin's An American in Paris. Under the baton of young Wayne
Marshall, the Royal SNO found the perfect balance between American ritz
and Parisian chic. Trumpeter John Gracie shone in his seductive
projection of Gershwin's corny melody, employing his flat cap as an
alternative to the traditional mute. A beret may have been a little more
appropriate?
Returning for a second-half solo spot, Williams delivered an exquisite
collection of guitar miniatures. Two Albeniz numbers allowed for
impressive technical wizardry but it was the four pieces by
South-American Agustin Barrios which revealed the truly sensual
Williams. Utterly compelling, his Andean folk dance and romantic
serenade ended a memorable recital in a display of stunning virtuosity.

TEENAGE schoolchildren are to be targeted for increased health
promotion following a report yesterday which showed a deterioration in
exercise, diet, and other health-related behaviours as they got older.
The two years from second to fourth year charted a growing appetite
for sweets, cigarettes, drink and drugs, and a waning of enthusiasm for
exercise.
However, Greater Glasgow Health Board officials were encouraged by the
fact that the report -- based on a survey of 2600 second and fourth-year
pupils -- showed smoking rates overall have come down.
The pupils, aged from 12 to 16, and from 15 schools randomly selected
but stratified to reflect variations between affluence and deprivation,
answered questions about their lifestyle, their eating, drinking and
recreational habits, drug-taking, and their own worries about health.
Television proved an almost universal pastime when the teenagers were
asked about their previous day's activities; fewer than 60% of
second-year pupil had done any homework, and computing was more popular
among boys than girls.
The activities listed were not mutually exclusive, but a picture
emerged of a passive generation -- while a large majority watched TV or
listened to music, fewer than a third read a book and only 10% to 15%
played an instrument.
Dr Carol Tannahill, the board's director of health promotion, who
organised the survey, expressed concern that 7% of boys and 17% of girls
admitted not participating in any of a list of 35 popular sporting
activities.
Sweets and soft drinks were the favourite target of pocket money in
both age groups, but in the older age group there was an increase in
spending on cigarettes and alcohol, and a decline in spending at leisure
centres and sports equipment.
When they were asked what they worried about, looks emerged as the
biggest single pre-occupation -- more than half of all girls and 20% of
boys, but health itself appeared to be the least of their worries.
The problem for health promoters like Dr Tannahill is that, while
people tend to change their behaviour if they feel it is threatening
their health, to a teenager these threats are not obvious because
generally they are healthier . . . even if they are storing up trouble
for later.
Nevertheless she was concerned to see one in five teenage girls
worrying a lot, or quite a lot, about their health. Girls also emerged
as less likely to feel at ease visiting their doctor.
''Perhaps it is understandable nowadays, when health is such a
high-profile subject, and you can't separate it from other issues --
looks, for example, are associated with health, and they are obviously a
big worry at that age.''
Dr Tannahill links health problems with people's own self-esteem, and
their own perception of how much control they have over factors
influencing their health.
Self-esteem appeared to increase with age, though it was lower in
girls than in boys, and proportionately more of those with high
self-esteem said that they would be taking precautions against HIV in
the future.
The feeling of being in control of their own health -- termed an
internal as opposed to an external locus of control -- made them less
likely to smoke and, if they did, more likely to have the intention of
giving up.
In spite of the sharp rise in smoking between second and fourth year,
when 16% of boys and 20% of girls reported smoking regularly, most
wanted to stop, and Dr Tannahill said: ''These are healthier figures
than 10 years ago, when one in four smoked. But it is imperative that
young people are offered appropriate help and advice at this early stage
-- it will be much harder for them to stop later on. We could make a big
impact with a programme of support tailored to their needs.''
More efforts are to be directed at the licence trade in an attempt to
cut teenage drinking -- by fourth year 13% of boys and 8% of girls were
drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week, bought mainly from
off-licences.
Among fourth-year pupils, 60% had been offered drugs and 82% of boys
knew someone they thought was taking them; cannabis resin was the most
common drug on offer.
The pupils were also asked about their knowledge of sexual health,
contraception, and HIV -- though three schools refused to put the
questions relating to HIV.
The biggest single source of information about sex -- up to 44% in the
case of fourth-year boys -- was friends, followed by parents and school
lessons.

SO you remember standing chap-legged on a hockey pitch whimpering a
prayer for the ball to take a far route from your frozen stookie of a
body. Or you recall the puce-faced refugee from the paratroopers
whipping you with verbal insults over the vaulting horse.
So does David Joy. Is it then any wonder that young people don't want
to join in team sports given the miserable time many are forced to
endure? But they do. He has the evidence to prove it.
The challenge, he argues, is to create quality opportunities, good
facilities, specialised coaching, for young people.
It has to compete with all the other leisure options that do not
demand being miserable for fun. ''There is this assumption that
youngsters are not joining in because they don't want to. We would
challenge that. Our experience shows it is not the case,'' he said.
''Clearly a lot of young people are not participating in sport, or
taking physical exercise. We know that. But we have to begin to look at
the reasons behind that.''
Mr Joy, a former PE teacher and volleyball coach, is director of a
project, Team Sport Scotland, set up by the Scottish Sports Council in
1991.
The experience of the project, three-and-a-half years on, turns on its
head the notion of a nation of glum, lazy, teens wheezing from fridge to
couch, whose experience of exercise is confined to zapping remote
controls.
''What our project is showing is that when you create quality
opportunties for young people, there is no shortage of youngsters who
want to take part.''
But it is not enough to offer Friday night coaching by an aggressive
coach in a dump. Sport, he says, has to be attractive to compete.
The days when youngsters would lift a badminton racket and play
against a back wall are gone. Sport, any kind of physical recreation,
has to tempt them away from the leisure centres, the shopping malls, and
the arcades.
Team Sport Scotland has successfully demonstrated that quality
opportunities create significant demand.
Mr Joy cites the example of football for girls. Three years ago, there
were 200 girls participating in Lothian region's one-day annual festival
for school-age youngsters. He found a lot of glum girls bored by the
entire event on the sidelines. This year, after providing in-service
courses for teachers, extending provision, the event spanned three days.
There were 450 primary school girls and 250 secondary pupils taking
part.
The project has 12 co-ordinators, one for each of its team sports, and
has recently begun working to expand provision in swimming and
athletics. It has an annual budget of #500,000. They work with local
authorities and sports associations to improve sports provision for all
youngsters. There are 90,000 young people taking part and the project
has been given the go-ahead for another three years.
There is no doubt, Mr Joy says, from the evidence that youngsters do
want to be involved in sport. But those involved in providing it have to
think carefully about what is on offer.
''What opportunities are there, how are they being presented, what can
a club provide for them? All these questions have to be asked and
carefully considered before we start writing off youngsters as lazy, or
sluggish, or unwilling to get up off the couch.''

HAVE we really bred a generation of trash-guzzling couch-potatoes
obsessed with the next episode of Neighbours, and worried mainly about
their acne and the source of their next pot noodle?
If the answer is yes, perhaps the real question is whether they are
all that different from their parents.
Just as the TV schedules have changed, with Aussie soaps taking over
from junk Westerns, so have the menus -- the pie and chips have given
way to a variety of attractive snacks aimed at instant gratification.
The result is that too many young Scots are going for high-fat,
high-salt, sugar-laden food at the expense of the whole-grain bread,
milk, fish, fruit and vegetables that their bodies need.
How does healthy food compete with the quick-hit of the chocolate bar
and the fizzy drink? Not well, so far -- the survey showed that 27% of
boys and 14% of girls never considered their health when choosing what
to eat. Fish was seldom eaten, with 77% eating it less than once a week
-- and that could include the greasy chip shop version. Only 35% eat
vegetables and 45% fruit most days.
Some Glasgow schools are already hitting back by involving pupils in
the selection of cafeteria menus. This is part of a national strategy
called School of Nutrition Action Groups, which began last September.
''The idea is that, if children are involved in decision-making as to
what is on offer, they will be more likely to accept it,'' said Kathy
Cowbrough, chairwoman of the Scottish Community Nutrition Group.
It is the latest stage in the move away from the traditional
meat-and-two veg set meal that was once a feature of school lunch. The
cafeteria set-up that has largely replaced is inevitably a compromise,
but Ms Crowbrough said: ''The schools saw that they were losing pupils
from the traditional set-up -- they just went out to shops and
carry-outs.
''Involving the children with the catering, health education and home
economics staff gives them the opportunity to find out what children
want that might make health food more acceptable. It might be something
simple -- like the fact that the milk is served warm and they don't like
it that way.''
Other solutions are not so simple. Dr Tannahill said: ''The
availability of healthy food makes it harder for parents to offer a
healthy diet. It is much harder in some areas to buy a nice piece of
fruit than a packet of crisps or chocolate.''

Julia Langdon speaks to a leading gynaecologist who combines a sense
of fun with his professional fascination for women
SCENE: a pretty street behind Harrods in London's Knightsbridge. I am
knocking rather nervously on the door of a house owned by a man reputed
to be the most famous gynaecologist in the world. Nervous? Well, what on
earth does one ask a gynaecologist about? Just try it: ''How did you get
into this line of business, then?'' or: ''Do you enjoy your work?'' or:
''What made you want to do this sort of thing?''
The conduct of an interview with an author is usually quite
straightforward. The interviewer will wish to discuss the subject matter
of the writer's expertise and to learn more of the character of the
subject of the interview, in order to paint a verbal picture of the
person.
The author is, probably reluctantly, submitting himself or herself to
the dubious business of allowing the publicity people to arrange
interviews with journalists who probably know nothing about the subject
but who may help to promote sales of the book. The journalist should
know what to ask.
Yes, but where can one possibly start with a man who has entitled his
memoirs as this man has? You read the words with disbelief -- The
Cutting Edge. ''This can't be serious,'' you think.
And, mercifully, it turns out that of course, it isn't. Professor S.
Joel Joel-Cohen is very serious indeed about lots of things, but the
title of the book tells a great deal about him, too. He opens the door
and he is charming and amusing and a bit of a flirt -- which we shall
get to in a minute -- and apparently entranced to find himself the
subject of an interview, albeit somewhat nervous about how he will be
portrayed.
He does not wish to be portrayed as a joker, or, rather, just as a
joker. But it is immediately obvious that here is an active sense of
humour, a very Jewish sense of humour, a relentless, quick-fire,
''are-you-still-with-me-Madam?'' jokey line of repartee. This may be
unexpected in the operating theatre, but is it entirely surprising from
a man who was first cousin to the late Sid James?
An explanation of the name now. Our hero's given name was Sidney Joel
Cohen. This was also the name of his cousin -- named after the same
grandfather -- and inconveniently in the same primary class. The teacher
asked who was the elder of the two Sids and it was the cousin, by three
months. He won the right to be known as Sid, and later adopted the
surname James.
''Sid became much more famous than I could ever be,'' writes the
other, perhaps somewhat wistfully. ''I am sure more people have heard of
Sid James than of Joel Cohen.'' Yet both of them distinguished
themselves in their very different fields -- and both of them would have
enjoyed the idea that while Joel can raise a laugh, nobody ever asked
Sid to wield a knife.
Joel operated on his cousin once, when they were in the Army together.
Even now he won't repeat what Sid said on being cut up by his
gynaecological cousin; in view of some of the stories he does relate,
one should blush at the very thought of what it might have been.
Joel changed his name twice. At a later stage, he added the extra Joel
to avoid confusion with another of the same name who might have
prevented his re-entry to his native South Africa. He refused, however,
on another occasion to change his name, to deny his Jewishness -- even
though he is an atheist -- when it was offered as a condition of
awarding him a distinguished medical post.
It was a decision perhaps made easier by the fact that this was when
he was in the Army just before the Second World War and he was spending
much of his time in the General Hospital in Johannesburg stitching up
the heads of those injured demonstrating in Nazi rallies.
While those of us who know little -- or as little as is necessary --
of gynaecology may not be familiar with the name of Joel-Cohen, it is
very famous indeed in the operating theatre. Sir George Pinker, one
gynaecologist who is known in this country because he has attended upon
the royals, has hailed Joel-Cohen as a pioneer and he has been described
as the most famous gynaecological operating surgeon in the world and as
a surgeon whose innovative techniques have indelibly altered the
practice of gynaecology.
He is a Senior Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynaecologists and Visiting Professor at King's College Hospital,
London.
Why gynaecology? Partly chance. Of the jobs he did, he found it suited
him. He believes he has an ability to get into women's minds (and he
certainly still tries: probing, questioning: Marriage? Partner?
Children? Just checking whether you're free, he says.) He thinks,
probably rightly, that he understands women. He developed the skills of
getting women to talk easily about their sex lives.
He became fascinated with the fact that it was a branch of medicine
that combined a variety of medical skills: psychology, surgery,
midwifery, general practice. He thinks that women should be running more
things.
And what is even more interesting is that this brash, brilliant, jokey
millionaire surgeon, born the youngest of five children in a family so
poor that he slept winter and summer on a back verandah with a canvas
curtain to keep off the rain, this man in his comfortable house in this
exclusive area of London has not charged anybody he has treated since
1973. If anyone he has treated privately has insisted upon paying, the
money has gone to charity.
So he is an old man now, 71, and he officially retired as a surgeon in
1979. He was in Hong Kong at the time and he had done eight operations
before lunch and he said to himself: ''Joel, you will never operate
better than you did today, so you've just retired,'' but he has remained
very much involved with work, advising, lecturing and writing.
The events of 1973 were set in train many years before. He went first
to operate by invitation at Albert Schweitzer's famed jungle hospital at
Lambarene in what was then French Equatorial Africa in 1957. He got to
know Schweitzer well. He used to operate wearing a pair of the old man's
trousers and the hospital used to save up the worst cases for the
visiting surgeon who would come for three or four weeks at a time.
One day, walking down ''Philosopher's Walk'', the pathway through the
jungle from the main hospital to the leper village -- so called because
it was here that Schweitzer would discuss issues with selected visitors
-- the doctor held his arm and said: ''My son, if you want to die a
happy man, you must do what I did and that is, when you have taken
enough out of life you must put back into life. Not only money, but you
yourself.''
Joel-Cohen asked: ''When will I know it is time ?'' Schweitzer
answered: ''Don't worry. Something will happen and you will know.''
And then one day someone arrived from Israel and asked him to help
restore a run-down department of gynaecology and obstetrics. The man
came in person because they didn't want money, they wanted Joel-Cohen.
It was the call.
He sold up in South Africa, disposed of the businesses he had
developed as a result of his successes, reassured his beloved wife,
Nesta (who said: ''Lovey, whatever you want to do, we will do'') and in
five years created an internationally acclaimed unit in Israel. And
never charged anyone ever again. ''I felt better that day than the day I
became a millionaire,'' he tells me and I know he is telling the truth.
He relates all this in the book, but -- and I am going to tell the
truth here -- it is a mish-mash of a book and he knows it. This is not
the fault of the author: he is a surgeon, he has written books about his
methods which have been acclaimed by his profession, but this is a book
for the lay reader with which he needed help.
A decent editor would have made a first-class book out of this and the
professor deserves so much better. The description of his wife's death
is heart-rending; his recollections of Albert Schweitzer are
fascinating; the life story is compelling. It should, really, be done
again, properly. Then a proper emphasis can be given to this truly
remarkable story.

THE nine Tory rebel MPs met at the Commons last night privately to
discuss their tactics now that several Ministers, led by Mr Major, are
holding out an olive branch to them.
They are to remain exiles from their party for a while longer because,
they decided, they are shifting Government attitudes to the European
Union.
They are not in a hurry to return to the Government Whip in the
Commons in these circumstances.
Today, eight of them will travel to Lowestoft to take part in a
demonstration supporting British fishermen against the new EU ruling
that the Spanish fleet is to be allowed into the fishing grounds off the
west of England.
So the Prime Minister's efforts to get the nine rebels back on the
Commons Whip to restore his overall majority is having no immediate
effect. It may now be some weeks before a reconciliation can be
achieved.
Last night, one of the rebels, Sir Teddy Taylor, won a unanimous vote
of confidence from his constituency party at Southend East.
Sir Teddy said: ''I'm very grateful to them. They're a grand bunch.
They're loyal and they're good Tories. They've been fully supportive of
me through all these problems.''

A particularly high level of cull cow slaughterings during the final
quarter of last year put cow prices under pressure, according to the
Meat and Livestock Commission UK Market Survey.
Cow and adult bull slaughterings reached almost 90,000 head during
October, a third higher than in the same quarter of 1993. Prices fell
sharply, and by the week ended Novemnber 12 the average cull cow price
was 69.24p a kilo liveweight. -- almost 10p down on a month earlier, and
13p down compared with the previous year.
With milk producers remaining under pressure from quota, cull cow
slaughterings are expected to remain at a high level during the first
part of this year.
* TWO substantial blocks of Scottish woodland -- in Angus and

TORY Nicholas Winterton last night accused the Government of betraying
the new home-owners of the eighties by its plans to cut the amount of
help the jobless receive with their mortgages.
The Macclesfield MP spent more than an hour thrashing out his views
with Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley.
Mr Winterton warned he would not support the Government in tomorrow's
Labour-initiated debate on the issue and, if given the chance to speak
in the debate, would make ''hostile'' comments.
The Government plans to limit mortgage interest relief for people on
income support as part of the Jobseeker's Bill currently going through
Parliament.
Mr Winterton said: ''The Conservative Party is abandoning its winning
formula which is the promotion of home ownership which has clearly
played a part in the party's success in recent General Elections.''

HILLWALKERS and ramblers are to be welcomed on to privately owned
forests in an initiative launched yesterday to increase public access to
the countryside.
The Forestry Commission scheme aims to encourage woodland owners who
receive a grant to allow public access in their forests. Yesterday, the
first sign in Scotland was unveiled at a private estate near Dunning,
Perthshire, by Sir Peter Hutchison, commission chairman.
Woodland owners in receipt of grant as contribution towards the costs
of providing recreation and access under the Woodland Grant Scheme will
be eligible for free signs and advice from the forestry authority.
It is estimated that the new measures will help to bring 3000 more
woodlands to the attention of ramblers in Britain.
Sir Peter explained: ''The 'Walkers Welcome' package provides signs
and discs free of charge for owners and managers to display at the
entrance to their woodlands.
''The package offers some helpful advice on public access to owners,
much of it based on the many years of experience the Forestry Commission
has gained.''

''WHILE we head for 20p, they head for 30p'' the Prime Minister
declared yesterday, once again rattling the bars of his cage to some
effect.
Given that his Government has had its back to the wall for a couple of
years and the issues that arise daily are mostly uncomfortable ones for
it, adopting attack as the best means of defence is probably the wisest
course.
Mr Major was actually responding to an allegation from Mr Harry Cohen
(Leyton -- Lab.), a man chiefly famous in the House for one day shaving
off his thick moustache and beard and rendering himself temporarily
unrecognisable to about 640 of his fellow MPs.
The allegation was the old familiar one that Tories had raised taxes
after the election having promised during the election to keep them
down.
Mr Cohen recycled this elderly but still plausible charge by
suggesting that Mr Major should be hauled before the Nolan Committee on
standards in public life on a charge of bringing manifesto pledges into
disrepute.
Prime Minister's Questions is not the time to attempt a reasoned
explanation of anything. Instead, Mr Major with a rare bow towards the
Liberal Democrat bench acknowledged their research in costing alleged
Labour promises and said he himself reckoned the Opposition had proposed
new taxes on windfall profits, payrolls, health, entertainment and
development.
Labour made rubbishing sounds, but Mr Major had successfully not
answered the question he had been asked.
Earlier, he had done the same as Mr Blair accused him of standing idly
by while Mr Cedric Brown and other privatised industry chiefs stuff
their wallets with loot from the pockets of the poor and needy. I
paraphrase, but that seemed to be the message the Leader of the
Opposition was trying to put across.
''Now we see it,'' cried the Prime Minister triumphantly as if Mr
Blair had just made a terrible error. What he could see through all that
stuff about public services run by the public in the public interest he
told us was that Labour, far from being shiny and new like its leader,
was still the unreconstructed, envious Labour Party of old.
The Prime Minister chose to ignore the probability that quite a lot of
the public and even Labour MPs may be angry rather than envious when
they hear the latest pay hike a privatised chief is to take home.
He then turned his artillery on those Labour MPs who are sending their
children to non-local authority schools. He read out an impressive list
-- well, five, but including Mr Blair and other Front Benchers.
''Cheap'' howled the Labour groundlings. ''You may say it's cheap, but
it's what they have done'' shouted back Mr Major rattling the bars so
furiously that one expected him to catapult through and land on Mr
Blair's lap. He was later backed by the Speaker. Miss Boothroyd said
that while she deprecated the use of MPs' children in political debate
it appeared to be the parents in question whom Mr Major had in his
sights.
However, having fought his way out of several tight corners the Prime
Minister succumbed to the dead hand of the Foreign Office. Mr Jeremy
Corbyn (Islington North), high on the list of Labour MPs Tory MPs love
to hate, had clearly found a worthy cause for some Tories cheered as he
went for the Indonesian occupation of East Timor and called on the
Government to stop supplying weapons which the Indonesians were using
for ''oppression and suppression'' in that terrorised half-island.
Mr Major's reply was drafted by an old FO hand for sure. In summary,
we had never recognised the Indonesian occupation of East Timor but we
saw no reason to stop profitably selling arms to the occupiers. Neither
the UN nor the EU had adopted a sanctions policy against Indonesia said
Mr Major.
So that was all right. If nobody else is doing the right thing we
don't have to do it either. After a combative beginning and middle it
was a pusillanimous end.

CUTS in the Scottish NHS supplies division will put patients at risk
and increase costs, Labour warned yesterday.
Thirty-seven jobs, around 40% of the total, are due to go in Edinburgh
and Glasgow in the division, which buys equipment from basic furniture
to brain scanners.
Mr John McAllion, Labour's health spokesman, said the staff had
considerable technical expertise and the division's bulk buying achieved
discounts up to 60%.
''Individual trusts will be unable to negotiate such massive discounts
and this will result in higher costs for the taxpayer,'' he said.
''The division also monitors and alerts trusts to hazards found in
equipment used for patient care. It is unacceptable that patients should
be subjected to risk as a direct result of Government dogma.''
Representatives of the public services union, Unison, will meet
supplies division management in Edinburgh today to discuss the
compulsory redundancies.

THE Government yesterday announced its backing for a Private Member's
Bill aimed at improving safety at outdoor activity centres in the wake
of the Lyme Bay canoeing tragedy in which four teenagers died.
The move came as a report by the Health and Safety Executive showed a
minority of centres had been served with improvement notices.
In a Government about-turn, Education Minister Eric Forth said he
welcomed a Bill by the Devonport Labour MP, Mr David Jamieson, and was
prepared to support it ''in principle''.
Mr Jamieson piloted private legislation for the compulsory
registration and inspection of centres in the face of Government
opposition.
The Bill paves the way for regulations which would ensure that the
3000 UK outdoor activity centres would be compelled to register with an
accreditation body.
They would be subject to regular inspection and there would also be a
complaints procedure.
Mr Jamieson said the report from the HSE, which examined 211 activity
centres, showed most were well run, but around 10% needed stricter
safety.
Further inspections would be carried out next year at other centres,
including several in Scotland providing climbing, sailing, canoeing, and
caving.
Four teenagers from a Plymouth school died in 1993 during an
expedition organised from the St Albans Challenge Centre, Lyme Regis,
Dorset.
The centre's managing director was last year jailed for three years
for manslaughter and the company behind it fined #60,000.

<HEADLINE>Armchair shopping lures more buyers from the High Street</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>11</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980189416</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
COUCH potatoes deserted Britain's High Streets last year and spent
#6520m on goods without leaving their living rooms -- and the trend is
growing.
Home shopping already accounts for 4.2% of all buying but will make up
15% within 25 years, according to a new report.
But it poses yet another threat to the traditional British High
Street, which has suffered the recession and competition from
out-of-town centres.
Catalogues, mail order, TV shopping, direct selling and now
inter-active computer shopping are all luring customers.
Buying over the phone or via a keyboard is more attractive to many
than hauling bags of shopping and pushchairs around town centres.
The report from business information company Key Note said more and
more shoppers would be joining the armchair revolution.
A spokeswoman said: ''Many forsake the push and shove of the High
Street to sit down with a telephone and credit card in the warmth of
their own home.
''The clever High Street stores have jumped on the bandwagon to get
involved with their own home shopping ventures rather than lose
customers.''
Next and the Early Learning Centre, for instance, have their own mail
order and up-market shoppers can order goods from Harrods without going
to the store.
Home shopping has already grown by over 15% in the last two years and
is expected to grow by another 8.3% in the next five, to #10.54bn.
Mail order and catalogues account for the bulk of the market, selling
#4400m worth.
But direct selling, where a salesman does the deal one-to-one with a
customer, and direct marketing, where the manufacturer does it, is
booming.
Last year both types of selling accounted for over #1000m each in the
home shopping market.
And direct selling has grown 81.5% between 1988 and 1994 thanks to
better techniques and better service.
The Key Note spokeswoman added: ''So far the growth has been in these
markets but interactive CD shopping and hi-tech phone systems are
coming.
''It could mean within a few years we will never need to leave our arm
chairs to choose anything from a holiday to insurance, having a bet to
buying a book.''

HAVING two members in each constituency could solve the problem of
gender balance in a Scottish parliament, Councillor Eric Milligan, the
Labour convener of Lothian Regional Council, told a conference in
Edinburgh yesterday.
People would cast two votes and parties would have the opportunity to
put forward one candidate of each sex.
Councillor Milligan claimed this would be a far better way of
increasing the representation for women than all-female shortlists.
If two-member seats resulted in too many members, the size of the
constituences could be increased, he told a conference on women and
local government organised by the John Wheatley Centre.
''If this system was introduced for a Scottish parliament, I think it
would only be a matter of time until it was established in the
Westminster Parliament,'' he said.
Defending the region's recent record on equal employment
opportunities, Councillor Milligan said that, in the late 1970s, 90% of
primary school staff were female but only 33% of head teachers were
women. This had now risen to 67% and this year 87% of those appointed to
such posts were women.
The former leader of Islington Borough Council, Margaret Hodge, who is
now the Labour MP for Barking, also questioned whether the setting up of
women's committees and women's units by many councils had really been
the best way to deal with women's issues.

GRAMPIAN region is recording a decline in exports while they rise
throughout the rest of Scotland.
However, it may be only a temporary blip, and there are encouraging
signs among the latest figures produced by the Scottish Council
Development and Industry.
A year ago, Grampian appeared to be leading Scotland out of recession,
with exports increasing three times as fast as those of the rest of the
country.
Yesterday figures for 1993 and early 1994 showed that Grampian's
exports, excluding whisky, dropped by 3% against a backdrop of booming
national exports which have risen by 22%. Add whisky, and Grampian's
exports rise above #1000m for the first time, but show only a 4.7%
increase on the previous year compared with a national figure of 19.2%.
This is the first time Grampian's exports have shown a drop in the six
years of SCDI surveys.
One of the main reasons for the fall is the decline in mechanical
engineering, which dropped 13% over the previous year, but Mr Ian
Armstrong, the SCDI's business information executive, said that the fall
back was not entirely surprising after the spectacular growth of almost
50% in the previous two years.
Of the remaining 15 sectors, 11 also show decline, but the most
optimistic results come in the food and drink sector -- up by #31.4m and
now accounting for 30% of local exports, a rise of 8% on the previous
year.
The food and drink sector (excluding whisky) is also the only one to
increase its share of Scottish exports. Grampian now accounts for 34.2%
of Scottish food and drink exports.
Grampian's exports dropped by #40m (14%) to European Union markets,
but to some extent this was balanced by increased exports to North
America and the Far East.
Mr Armstrong felt that the results of the Grampian survey were
disappointing, but he said the rise last year was so substantial that it
may represent some form of catching up or realignment with the national
position. Grampian was so far ahead of the Scottish picture last year
that it was difficult to see it continuing at quite that rate, but the
pointers were there that it would pick up again next year.

SCOTTISH workers yesterday wereurged to harness the power of their
pension funds to influence such issues as huge salary increases for
senior executives.
The Scottish Trades Union Congress has launched a campaign to
encourage members to add shareholder pressure to more traditional
industrial tactics.
A legal specialist, Mr Ivan Walker, yesterday briefed STUC officials
on how separate groups of employees could become involved in concerted
action against unpopular corporate decisions.
He said later that the strategy involved workers asking fund trustees
to take a stance on the policies of companies in which they hold shares.
It is understood that the trustees of one Scottish local authority
fund have already agreed to oppose the pay rise for Mr Cedric Brown at
the British Gas annual meeting in May.
Mr Ian Millar, STUC education officer, admitted that the campaign
would have to be approached on a long-term basis, but said the use of
pension funds was in line with recent Government statements that
shareholders, rather than Ministers, controlled the affairs of private
companies.
''We recognise that we will not necessarily be able to overturn board
decisions, but we can force directors to justify them, and also have an
influence before those decisions are made,'' he said.

THE mother of murder victim Yvette Wilson yesterday expressed her
anger over her daughter's death and urged people to help the growing
police investigation.
Mrs Marguerite Adam, 53, was speaking in West Kilbride commmunity
centre, which has become the headquarters of officers hunting the killer
of 27-year-old Mrs Wilson.
In a calm and measured voice she said: ''I would like to thank the
villagers for all their support so far. I want to ask them to do one
more thing for me -- that is, help find the pervert that has done this
to my wee girl.
''She was a lovely and talented person, and did not deserve this.
Please help the police in any way to get this swine locked up.''
This is the second tragedy to strike Mrs Adam and her husband -- their
other daughter died in a road accident seven years ago.
Mrs Wilson was found dead, her upper body burned beyond recognition,
in a workers' bothy at West Kilbride railway station on Saturday
evening.
Detective Chief Inspector Jeanette Joyce, who is leading the inquiry,
said: ''All murders are bad, but this was a particularly violent and
horrendous crime. It is vital that we catch the person who carried it
out quickly, and we need the help of the public to do that.''
She disclosed that Mrs Wilson's purse had been found on Saturday in
woodland near the station.
She added: ''I am anxious to speak to anyone who knows anything about
Yvette's movements between leaving work at Kip Marina shortly after 3pm
on Thursday and the discovery of her body on Saturday evening.
''We know that she was contacted at home by a female friend on
Thursday, to arrange a night out in Largs, but that she never made the
meeting. ''
Ms Joyce also asked anyone who used West Kilbride station at any time
between Thursday and Saturday, or who travelled on a train in either
direction on those days, to contact the incident room.
It has been established that Mrs Wilson was not sexually assaulted,
but police say they still have no clear motive for the killing. Ms Joyce
said that they could not rule out the possibility that the killer might
strike again.
Ms Joyce said: ''It may be that you suspect a friend, neighbour or
relative, who may have appeared last week with cuts or even burns which
they could not properly explain.
''If so, please contact us and the information will be treated in
confidence.''

ROYAL officials yesterday unveiled back-to-basics designs for the
restoration of fire-damaged Windsor Castle.
Only three of the principal rooms through which the disastrous blaze
swept in November 1992 are to be redesigned, rather than restored to
their original splendour.
The Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales, whose liking for
traditional architecture is well known, presided over the restoration
committee, which has decided on designs for the three rooms based on a
''modern reinterpretation'' of the original Gothic architecture.
After the great fire damaged more than 100 rooms on five floors in the
north-east section of the castle, there were calls for modernist
architects to be allowed to prove their skills in the reconstruction.
The new designs for the Queen's Private Chapel and the Holbein and
Stuart Rooms follow classic principles in the creation of a new state
ante-room for the St George's Hall banqueting room and a new separate
private chapel.
Work to stabilise the damaged areas is now complete. Workmen have put
in steel beams and concrete floors where there was a danger of collapse
-- especially in the the Brunswick Tower, where the wooden joists and
floors were destroyed.
The new separate private chapel would be set within the area of the
old Holbein Room with a new vestry and a balcony with choir and organ
lofts.
St George's Hall, whose magnificent wooden roof studded with armourial
shields of Garter Knights was destroyed in the blaze, is to have a new,
more pointed ceiling, raised above the old one to give the hall, the
scene of state banquets, a better sense of proportion.
The rest of the hall, two metres deep in debris after the fire, is
being restored to its former gothic glory.
* A Swiss firm of architects, Herzog and de Meuron, is to take on the
project of turning an old power station on the bank of the Thames into
one of the world's largest art galleries, the planned #100m Tate
Gallery, it was announced yesterday.

THE British and American Governments yesterday closed ranks over new
allegations that Iran and Syria -- not Libya -- were responsible for the
bombing of PanAm Flight 103 at Lockerbie in 1988 which killed 270
people, the UK's biggest mass murder.
The Foreign Office in London, the State Department in Washington, and
the Scottish Office all issued strongly worded rejections of the latest
claims, by film maker Alan Francovich, that an American intelligence
document released under the country's freedom of information rules
indicated conclusively that Iran had paid #6.5m to have the bombing
carried out.
Whitehall dismissed the document as adding nothing to what was already
known about the bombing. References to Iranian involvement cited second
or third-hand sources, and the report had been heavily edited, Whitehall
said. The Scottish Office stated it was an old story which had recurred
over the years.
The State Department added that Iran had been an early focus of its
investigation, but that a three-year inquiry had uncovered no credible
evidence to support such a conclusion.
The Government came under pressure, however, from Sir Teddy Taylor,
MP, who tabled a Commons question asking when Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd was told of the existence of the document. Had the US not told
Britain, it would be ''shameful'', Sir Teddy said, but had Britian been
told, then the Government's official line on Lockerbie appeared
unbelievable.
The new allegations claim that a document leaked to Mr Francovich's
film team, who have made a controversial film resurrecting the original
Iran-Syria theory and identifying Ayatollah Mohtashami, the then Iranian
Interior Minister, as having paid terrorists to down a US airliner in
revenge for the shooting down of an Iranian airbus by an American
cruiser six months previously.
Two named Libyan intelligence operatives remain indicted by the Crown
in Scotland. Britain and America continue to press to have them brought
here for trial.
Sir Teddy has visited Libya three times in an attempt to break the
deadlock. The Shadow Foreign Secretary, Mr Robin Cook, repeated calls
for a full inquiry, the lack of which meant that relatives of the dead
did not know who was really responsible.
SNP leader Alex Salmond complained in the Commons that the Lord
Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, would not be available to answer
MPs questions about the bombing at the Scottish Grand Committee's first
question time on February 8.
As the months roll into years, however, the prospect of a succesful
prosecution of the Libyan suspects recedes. The Scottish police
investigators and the Crown Office cannot escape the old legal adage --
justice delayed is justice denied.
On the face of it, the latest outburst of publicity, fuelled by the
Francovich film team and by a BBC File on Four radio programme last
night, strikes at the heart of the Scottish prosecution case.
The purportedly damning leak is contained in a file on a totally
different subject, Iraqi air activity during the Gulf war. It crops up
baldly, apparently isolated and without proper attribution or
authentication. Intelligence agencies thrive on such ''bizarre gossip'',
a Whitehall source told The Herald.
The Government and the Crown in Scotland, while responding rather
wearily at official level, can safely close ranks on that basis to ride
out yet another storm of Lockerbie rumour.
When it comes to other matters nearer home, such as the investigation
of miscarriage of justice or perjury at earlier trials, the Crown Office
are not slow to point out the difficulties of retrospective
investigation after a lengthy lapse of time, justifying their inaction
time and again.
But they remain outwardly confident, however, that the case against
the Libyans can be sustained, despite the inevitable difficulties
created by the passing years.
They may, however, be finding it increasingly difficult to maintain
their obdurate stance as the cracks in the case against the Libyans
appear to grow.
With time, the Scottish stance is looking ever less secure. The
Scottish criminal legal establishment is increasingly made to look like
dupes, unwilling pawns in a global game.
While it is hard to feel sorry for Government and Crown authorities,
it is possible to sympathise with the police officers in the team put
together by Dumfries and Galloway constabulary in the days after the
disaster.
Their investigation was difficult in the extreme, with evidence
gleaned internationally and prepared in such a manner -- to Scottish
standards of corroboration -- as to stand up in any court in the world.
Early on in the Francovich saga it was disclosed by his detractors
that his film, The Maltese Double Cross, had been funded by one of Tiny
Rowland's companies with Libyan connections, a perfect vehicle for
questioning Mr Francovich's objectivity.
But Mr Francovich has other strings to his bow, including the claim at
Lady Thatcher herself blocked a judicial inquiry into Lockerbie. He is
now producing a tape which allegedly contains a confession by Mr Cecil
Parkinson, the former Transport Secretary, who first promised an inquiry
to the Lockerbie relatives and was then forced by the then Prime
Minister to retract.
Mr Francovich said yesterday that the Parkinson tape, made in 1993
during the making of another television programme and passed on to him
anonymously, showed that the authorities in the UK and the US had

The Scottish Office, however, stands by its Libyan line.

<HEADLINE>British Gas chief with #475,000 salary says other bosses get more. Political battle intensifies over executive pay as MPs' inquiry questions big increases</HEADLINE>

BRITISH Gas chief executive Cedric Brown yesterday defended his
#475,000 salary when he appeared before the Commons Employment Select
Committee.
Mr Brown faced rapid and hostile questioning from MPs as they
conducted their inquiry into the remuneration of directors and chief
executives of privatised utilities.
However, in combative mood, he told them his salary had been pitched
''at the median level'' compared with a number of other companies.
''Notwithstanding running the seventh-largest company in the country,
to my knowledge there are at least about 50 or more chief executives
earning more than that.''
He insisted that his salary increase had been 28%, not 75%, and told
MPs that a chief executive working for an American gas company in
competition with British Gas earned 10 times his salary.
Mr Brown admitted, however, that he should have handled news of his
pay rise differently.
Committee chairman Greville Janner (Leicester West -- Lab.) accused
British Gas of being ''tactless and insensitive'' for announcing plans
to cut the pay of retail staff, increase gas bills and reduce services
in High Street showrooms so soon after the 75% pay rise was published.
Mr Janner: ''Looking back, do you not agree that the whole way this
new remuneration package was handled was at the very least highly
insensitive and tactless?''
Mr Brown: ''It could have been handled better.''
However, Mr Brown, 59, vigorously defending his pay, told the MPs he
had worked his way up at British Gas in a career spanning 40 years.
''I started at the bottom. I wielded a pick and shovel, and when the
board came along three years ago and said they wanted me to be chief
executive I was delighted to accept.''
The pay package suggested last year was ''right for the company'' said
Mr Brown, who continued: ''I am trying to move this company into the
21st century as a fully competitive company.
''For Britain to create a society where someone in the seventh biggest
company can go from the bottom to the top is something which should be
encouraged.''
Also giving evidence yesterday was Dr James Smith, chairman of Eastern
Group, formerly Eastern Electricity, who was said to be paid #105,000
for a three-day week.
Their appearance came on the day that Labour released figures showing
that Mr Edmund Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, received more than
#1.2m last year, made up of #400,000 in pay and remuneration and an
extra #876,000 from executive share options.
The chief executive of National Power, John Baker, was shown to have
collected more than #1.1m, including #437,000 in pay and remuneration
and #713,000 from executive share options.
At the opening of the committee, Mr Janner , answered reports of his
declared interest in a consultancy that advises British Gas.
There had been speculation that Mr Janner would step aside as chairman
for the questioning of Mr Brown -- particularly after the Prime Minister
raised his interest in the consultancy, JSB, at yesterday's Question
Time.
Mr Janner announced to the packed committee: ''For the avoidance of
doubt, I draw attention to my declaration in the Register of Members'
Interests of my directorship of JSB Group, a training, communication and
law publishing company. ''One of the very many clients of that company
is British Gas.
''This fact does not need to be declared. JSB does not provide
services which depend essentially upon, or arise out of, membership of
the House.
''Nor have I any interest to declare in British Gas.''
Mr Brown said he agreed with his remuneration committee, which set his
pay, that the annual bonus element he had received previously was too
short term, and that a longer-term incentive was needed.
''The remuneration committee has just said this is the rate for the
job.''
Asked if he would accept a pay cut, Mr Brown said: ''I would stand
fast where I am and argue the case with the remuneration committee, but
at the end of the day I guess I would.''
He told Ms Angela Eagle (Wallasey -- Lab.) that his new salary would
cost the British Gas pension fund #750,000 after he retires at 65, but
said no employees would suffer a reduced pension as a result.
Ms Eagle told Mr Brown he earned #1000 a day when his showroom staff
were on #10,000 a year.
In his evidence, Dr Smith , defended the handling of his pay rises:
''The way we handled it was open and sensible.
''Where there are problems it is where there have been distortions in
reporting.''
Defending the rise, he said: ''We are no longer a nationalised
company. We are working in a competitive market place and it's a
different world -- an entirely different world.''
He said his salary rose from #87,000 just before privatisation, to
about #230,000 as chairman-chief executive of the privatised company.
He became news when it was reported that, since becoming non-executive
chairman of Eastern in 1993, he was paid #105,000 for a three-day week,
plus a pension which was thought could amount to #145,000 a year.
However, he told MPs: ''My contract with the company is a contract to
work no less than three days, and I am on call to the company for as
much of the week as is necessary to fulfil my duties.''

<HEADLINE>Woman tells murder bid trial of relationships during her 'open marriage' to university lecturer Wife dismissed the idea of being poisoned</HEADLINE>

THE wife of university lecturer Paul Agutter told a court yesterday
that she had considered the possibility that he had poisoned her gin and
tonic, then firmly dismissed the idea.
Mrs Alexandria Agutter, 39, told the High Court in Edinburgh:
''Clearly, in a case like this, you would have to be incredibly brain
dead not to think of all the possible options. So, I have considered it,
but I have rejected it.''
Mrs Agutter, who has a degree in English language and works part-time
as a dog-groomer and labourer, made it clear that she would not have
gone near her husband had she had any inkling that there was a spark of
malice in him, or any hint of danger.
''I am not a masochist,'' she told the court.
She went on to talk of an open marriage in which she and her husband
had formed other relationships without recriminations and how she
thought his latest partner was a nice person.
Dr Agutter, 48, of Kilduff Lodge, Athelstaneford, East Lothian, denies
attempting to murder his wife in their home by giving her atropine in a
glass of gin and tonic on August 28 last year. He also denies attempting
to murder an 11-year-old girl.
He further pleads not guilty to endangering the lives of eight people
who drank tonic water contaminated with atropine, allegedly placed by
him on the shelves of a Safeway supermarket in Edinburgh.
On the second day of the trial, Mrs Agutter said she and Dr Agutter
had married in June 1976, and had lived at Kilduff Lodge since 1980.
For several years, however, they had had separate bedrooms and did not
live as man and wife. About seven years ago, they had discussed divorce,
but rejected the idea.
Each had had relationships outwith the marriage, but this had not
created a problem. Mrs Agutter said that other people seemed to see
their lifestyle as more of a problem than they did. There had been no
jealousy, no tantrums, no recriminations, and no mystery.
In June 1993, her husband told her that he had started a relationship
with a woman called Carole Bonsall. He had been up front about the
situation, and had introduced her to Carole.
''She seems a perfectly nice person to me,'' added Mrs Agutter.
Asked if she had been prepared to accept her husband's relationship,
she replied: ''I did not consider it any of my business.''
She told how, on August 28 last year, Dr Agutter had prepared a gin
and tonic for her. ''I thought it tasted incredibly strong. I felt very
dry-mouthed, as if I had a terrific amount to drink very quickly.''
She became dizzy, felt heavy and unable to stand up, and began to see
everything with a ''gossamer silk'' effect. Then a corner of the room
began to bend inwards.
''I just felt pretty weird.''
Mrs Agutter agreed with Mr Neil Murray QC, defending, that, after
giving evidence, she wanted to get away from people like the press, who
had been hounding her.
But that certainly did not mean that she was in any way turning her
back on her husband. She had visited him regularly in prison awaiting
trial.
She agreed that, during their marriage, she and Dr Agutter had
gradually drifted apart. While both were academics her interests had
become more sociable, involving mixing with people and outdoor pursuits,
while Dr Agutter, a lecturer in biochemistry at Napier University in
Edinburgh, was more cerebral and intellectual.
Dr Agutter had been perfectly open about his relationship with Ms
Bonsall, although Mrs Agutter agreed that she had not expected it to
last. ''I have a cynical outlook on life in general,'' she explained.
The trial continues.

DIRTY beaches are on the increase, sullied by everything from oil
drums and fishing nets to sanitary towels and condoms, according to a
survey published yesterday.
No Scottish beaches feature in the Reader's Digest and the Marine
Conservation Society's list of the top ''dirty dozen'' beaches surveyed
and cleaned up in Beachwatch '94.
Nor, however, do any of the Scottish coastlines make the list of the
12 cleanest.
More examples of every type of debris were found in the 1994 survey
compared with the 1993 survey with the exception of glass.
In terms of sewage related debris, such as panty-liners, tampons, and
condoms, Scotland fared considerably better than nearly all English and
Welsh water authorities, with the exception of Jersey and Guernsey,
where only minimal debris was found.
Mr Tom Poodle, depute director and chief engineer with the Clyde River
Purification Board, said that technology was rarely able to keep up with
new products on the market.
''When something new is introduced like a panty-liner or something
like that, it just gets through the existing system,'' he said. ''The
best way to stop the problem is for people to stop flushing things.''
Dr Tom Leatherland, chief scientific officer with the Forth River
Purification Board, which covers the Lothian and Fife areas, identified
Largo Bay at the mouth of the Leven as one of the worst sites for sewage
discharge in Fife, and Portobello and Cramond Island near Edinburgh as
among the worst in Lothian.
''Although 40% of the beaches in this area are unsatisfactory, this
still represents an improvement over six years ago when about 60% were
unsatisfactory,'' he said.
Water experts in Scotland sounded a word of caution, however, warning
that such surveys tended to be somewhat subjective.
These are the dirtiest and cleanest beaches in the survey:
Dirtiest: 1 New Brighton, Merseyside; 2 Croyde, Devon; 3 Castle Beach,
Dale, Dyfed; 4 St Anne's Promenade, Lancashire; 5 Fleshwick Bay, Isle of
Man; 6 Cuckmere Haven, East Sussex; 7 Sand Bay, Avon; 8 Talland Bay,
Cornwall; 9 Holywell, Slade, West Glamorgan; 10 Broad Haven North,
Dyfed; 11 Hillend, Gower, West Glamorgan; 12 Berrow, Somerset.
Cleanest: 1 Trearddur Bay, Gwynedd; 2 Porth Neigwl, Gwynedd; 3 Thorpe
Bay, Essex; 4 Chapel Copse, Binstead, Isle of Wight; 5 Platte Saline,
Alderney; 6 Brightstone, Isle of Wight; 7 Ryde Sands, Isle of Wight; 8
North Beach, South Shields, Tyne and Wear; 9 Rainey Island, Strangford
Lough, County Down; 10 Trasnagh, Inishardan, County Down; 11 Benllech,
Anglesey, Gwynedd; 12 Sandbanks, Poole, Dorset.

BRITAIN'S most northerly lighthouse, which has been manned by keepers
for over a century, is to be automated.
The last shift will leave Muckle Flugga lighthouse, which stands 200ft
above the Atlantic on a wave-battered rock, at the end of March, 140
years and seven months after the first keeper set foot on the outcrop.
Most of the country's other 342 lighthouses are being sold off as
fashionable homes, but Muckle Flugga will have to face the Atlantic
storms untended.
''It would not make sense to sell it,'' said a spokeswoman for the
Northern Lighthouse Board, which is responsible for all of Scotland's 84
main lighthouses. ''For a start it is so remote and isolated that you
need a helicopter just to get to it and any spare room which exists in
it is packed full of equipment, leaving very little space for anyone to
live in.''
Muckle Flugga, one mile north of the Shetland island of Unst, is on
the same latitude as the southern-most reaches of Greenland.
The lighthouse was first established during the Crimean War, 1854-56,
when commissioners were urged by the government to erect a light to
protect Her Majesty's ships.
Robert Louis Stevenson's father Thomas and his uncle David engineered
the 54ft high tower, and a permanent light appeared in January 1858 at a
cost of #32,000. Stevenson himself was taken by his father to Muckle
Flugga: a visit which, according to local legend, influenced the writing
of Treasure Island.
The original tower still stands, despite being battered by the wind
and sea whipped up by countless gales. But for the keepers who regularly
climb the 71 steps to tend the light, the prospect of leaving is a sad
one.
''No matter how remote it is you just seem to get attached to the
place,'' said Mr John Stevenson, an Orcadian who has been first
assistant keeper at Flugga for three-and-a-half years.
''There is just something attractive about the place. It gets pretty
miserable in the winter when you can only go out for a short walk round
the tower. But in the summer you can watch the birds and walk down to
the small pier to sunbathe. That is a great feeling but it is something
you cannot describe. I shall certainly be sad to leave.''

<HEADLINE>Too many teachers, so training places are cut</HEADLINE>

PLACES on teacher training courses are being cut because newly
qualified teachers are finding it difficult to get jobs.
The Scottish Education Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, conceded
yesterday that there were more new teachers than available jobs.
Earlier this month the Educational Institute of Scotland expressed
concern about the mismatch between teacher supply and demand after
figures showed that many newly qualified teachers were failing to secure
full-time posts.
Lord James said yesterday that the numbers the Scottish Office had set
for courses beginning in the autumn ''should be adequate to meet the
needs of the education service''.
Overall, total intakes for the various courses run by teacher
education institutions have been cut by more than 200, to 2260 places.
The biggest reduction is in the one-year postgraduate course for
secondary school teachers, where numbers are to fall from 1315 to 960.
A reduction has also been made in the intake for the one-year
postgraduate course for primary teachers.
Numbers will rise, however, for the four-year BEd courses for PE,
music, and technology teachers for the secondary sector and for the four
year BEd course for primary teachers.
But the primary sector increase is smaller than was set out in the
consultation exercise because there are too many primary teachers.
The overall reduction in intake will affect the teacher training
institutions, which receive a tuition fee from the Government for each
student.
They will be unable to make up the shortfall by taking on more
students elsewhere because the Government has put the brakes on
expansion.

SUITS of many colours are set to cause a stir among bridge players who
religiously observe the game's traditions.
A number of American casinos will next month start using packs of
cards containing blue diamonds and green clubs, as well as red hearts
and black spades.
The idea is said to be aimed at helping short-sighted poker players in
smoke-filled rooms.
But it could also find a useful application in bridge, where confusing
hearts and diamonds, which have the same hue in standard packs, can lead
to heated exchanges between partners.
Waddington's Games, Britain's biggest card manufacturer, now plans to
explore the market potential of multi-coloured card packs in Britain.
But few of the country's bridge players are likely to want to bid
adieu to the traditional black and red decks.
Peter Stocken, chairman of the English Bridge Union, which has 39,000
members, said: ''I doubt it will catch on in bridge circles, because
we're an awfully traditional lot.
''Personally, as a poker player myself as well as a bridge player, I
think it's an excellent idea.''
He added that poor colour co-ordination had caused even top
international bridge players to make mistakes.
Mr Stocken said a new idea accepted by big American casinos was likely
to be adopted elsewhere.
''I think if it happens in Las Vegas it could catch on in the poker
world, but not the bridge world,'' he said.
Waddington's promotional products manager, Phil Byron, said she would
be contacting casinos in Britain to see if they were interested in packs
with four-colour suits.

STUDENTS could help pay their way through college by doing ''citizen's
service'', Labour's Shadow Education Secretary suggested yesterday.
Mr David Blunkett said the idea was being considered as an option in
Labour's review of higher education.
The party acknowledged last month that it was examining ways in which
graduates might pay back some of the cost of their education as an
alternative to the present much-criticised student loan system.
Yesterday, Mr Blunkett floated the idea that students could also
''earn'' bursaries to college by doing community service.
Labour is advocating ''citizen's service'' of up to nine months as a
way of strengthening young people's commitment to the community.
Speaking to the National Youth Agency Citizenship and Community
Service conference, Mr Blunkett said for many youngsters outside work or
education the ''umbilical cord'' with society had been cut.
Citizen's service was a way of renewing that bond. But it was not an
alternative to investment in creating jobs, and it should not be seen as
a ''stigma or punishment'' for those who could not find work.
Labour was prepared to look at the possibility that those who had
undertaken citizen's service could use it as a ''credit'' for further
and higher education.
Mr Blunkett added later that in other parts of the world young people
were ''rewarded'' for the work they did for the community by credits
towards the cost of their education.
In Britain, the armed services and a number of firms offered bursary
schemes to give youngsters financial assistance with further and higher
education.

AN MP has called for an immediate inquiry into why Millport pier was
so badly damaged in storms last week.
Mr Brian Wilson said he was ''astonished'' that the pier had been
devastated by the wind and high seas less than three years after a full
refurbishment programme had been carried out.
Speaking after a visit to inspect storm damage in the Isle of Cumbrae
town, Mr Wilson said that an inquiry should be launched.
He said: ''I could not believe the extent of the damage. When you
consider that the pier has been in place for over 100 years and that
some parts of it date back to that time it is both surprising and
disappointing that this level of damage has been done to pier boards
which were replaced less than three years ago.''
The Cunninghame North MP helped local councillors put together a
funding package, with Highlands and Islands Enterprise, after the pier
had been unable to take large vessels for several years.
More than #600,000 was spent on the pier in 1992 and since then
pleasure boats, including the paddle steamer Waverley, have been calling
on Millport bringing thousands of tourists.
Mr Wilson continued: ''I will be seeking expert advice on what
happened but it has been suggested that the bolting down of boards to
the uprights of the pier may have contributed to the damage.''
Mr Wilson will be approaching Cunninghame District Council to voice
his concerns and to seek guidance.
He said: ''It is not enough to say things will be all right because
the pier is insured. This should not have happened and it will be
difficult, if not impossible, to insure it the next time.''

A MAN threatened to set himself ablaze in front of Buckingham Palace
yesterday. He was saved by two Royal Park policemen who grabbed him at
the main gates of the palace as he held a cigarette lighter over his
head.
A Royal Parks spokesman said the policemen found a 49-year-old man,
doused in petrol, propped against the palace's central gates. The man
was detained under the Mental Health Act but later discharged, no
offence having been committed, after he was examined by a psychiatric
nurse and a social worker and found to be fit to be returned to his
family.

From MATT SPETALNICK
Los Angeles, Tuesday
THE trial of O. J Simpson got under way at last today, with what could
be damning evidence unveiled during the prosecution's opening
statements. A prosecutor said DNA tests showed a ''trail of blood''
belonging to the former football star and his alleged victims leading
from the murder scene to his car and finally to his house.
It provided high drama for millions of TV viewers in what was billed
as the ''murder trial of the century'', but not for long. Judge Lance
Ito suddenly pulled the plug on live coverage after a robot camera in
the courtroom showed the face of an alternate juror.
Before that, deputy District Attorney Marcia Clarke had produced the
blood revelations. She said a glove found on the grounds of Simpson's
estate was stained with his blood as well as that of his former wife,
Nicole Brown Simpson, 35,and her friend Ron Goldman, 25. Its match was
found two miles away, where the pair were found.
''The mere fact that we find blood where there should be no blood in
the defendant's house, in the driveway, in his car and in a sock at the
foot of his bed, that trail of blood . . . is devastating proof of his
guilt,'' Clark told jurors.
She said hair and fibre samples also linked Simpson to the June 12
stabbings outside Mrs Simpson's Brentwood townhouse.
As Clark finished her presentation, complete with photographs of the
victims, Ito cut off all sound from the trial and said it was his
''inclination'' not to allow any further TV coverage.
He then stopped the trial for the day as Simpson's lawyers argued that
it was not fair to stop broadcasting the proceedings when the defence
team was about to begin its opening statement.
Earlier the tone of the prosecution's case was set by deputy District
Attorney Christopher Darden, who said: ''He killed her because he
couldn't control her. He killed Ron Goldman because he got in the way.
''Control and possessiveness were the central theme of their
relationship. It wasn't love, it was obsession.'' He said Simpson was
''a batterer, a wife-beater, an abuser, a controller.'' He killed his
wife ''for a single reason, not because he hated her. He loved her. He
killed her for a reason as old as time itself, out of jealousy.''
Goldman, an aspiring male model, was killed simply because he was ''in
the wrong place at the wrong time'', Darden said. Behind Simpson's
smiling public mask was a violent bully.
The prosecution's opening statement brought the victims' families to
tears. Simpson squirmed in his seat in the crowded courtroom.
The football legend has declared himself ''absolutely, 100% not
guilty''.
When Simpson tried to make eye contact with Nicole's mother, Juditha
Brown, she started crying. A guard appeared to caution Simpson to stop
staring.
The judge ruled earlier that Simpson could bare his scars for jurors
in an effort to prove that his football injuries deprived him of the
power necessary to slash two people to death.
However, Darden charged that Simpson battered, threatened and stalked
his ex-wife in a 17-year ''cycle of violence''.
He said that the jury would hear two recordings of separate calls
Nicole made to the police when her husband was attacking her.
On the first, in 1989, ''you will hear the voice of a woman screaming
and of the defendant slapping her.'' Police went to her house, and found
her hiding in the bushes, dressed only in a bra and sweatpants.
She ran to them, screaming: ''He's going to kill me. O. J. is going to
kill me.'' Her lip was cut, there were bruises on her face, and marks of
fingers around her throat.
When Nicole finally moved out of the house in 1992, her former husband
stalked her, following her everywhere.
In April, 1993, he watched her through the window having sex, at three
in the morning. The second recorded cry for help was in October, 1993,
when Simpson forced his way into Nicole's house. He can be heard
shouting, on the tape, about the things he had seen through the window
six months before.
On the fatal night, June 12, there was a dance recital at one of the
children's school. Simpson greeted all Nicole's family, but sat glaring
at her throughout the show.
Nicole pointedly did not invite him to accompany the family to a
restaurant for dinner afterwards. She was murdered three hours later.

Nuku'alofa, Tuesday
ONCE upon a time, big was beautiful in the tiny South Pacific island
kingdom of Tonga. Now, fat is out.
Alarmed by recent survey results showing increasing obesity among its
105,000 people, officials have launched a weight awareness campaign.
A national slimming competition is among measures planned to encourage
healthy, weight-watching. Head of state King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV, 76, is
leading by example.
Before he trimmed down in recent years, the monarch was listed in the
Guinness Book of Records as the world's heaviest monarch at 31 stone
7lb. Now he sticks to a strict diet and a regular exercise regime.
Tongans, like other Polynesians, are traditionally ''big, heavy-boned
people,'' government nutritionist Vizo Halavatau said today.
Traditionally, ''if you were thin, people thought you were
unhealthy,'' she said.
Doctors believe Polynesians might have a genetic predisposition to
obesity, a legacy of alternating periods of plenty and famine over many
generations.
Natural selection favoured those who were more efficient at storing
fat, a trait which could be life-saving during long exploratory sea
voyages or after crop-destroying hurricanes.
''Now Tongans are less active and they eat more, particularly imported
foods and fatty meat,'' Ms Halavatau added.
She said that obesity was a major cause of diabetes and hypertension
and was now approaching epidemic proportions.--AP.

Grozny, Tuesday
RUSSIAN troops tightened their stranglehold on rebel Chechnya's
capital today, turning heavy artillery fire and Grad missiles on
Grozny's suburbs from the conquered city centre.
In Moscow, Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev gave the clearest
sign yet of top-level dissent over the military campaign to bring the
tiny breakaway Caucasus region to heel. He said six or seven generals
would be fired for disobeying orders.
International relief officials in Geneva said thousands of citizens
would be evacuated from Grozny. Today, suburban residents did not wait
to be helped, but began heading out of town as the war moved
uncomfortably close and a relative lull in the fighting came to an
abrupt end.
''This is the beginning of the end for Grozny,'' said local resident
Misha Yendiyev, gazing at palls of black smoke rising from three blazing
petrol storage tanks in western Zavodskoi district. ''The Russians are
coming to finish things off.''
After a quiet morning during which some people ventured out to find
supplies, the shelling began. By the middle of the day, thunderclaps of
Grads were shaking the city interspersed with the booming of artillery
and rattle of automatic gunfire.
Despairing civilians from the suburbs streamed out of town in trucks
weighed down with tattered pieces of furniture, on horse-drawn carts
with cows tied to the axles and on foot.
But their road west to safety was blocked in several new places.
Unknown attackers blew up two bridges overnight, forcing cars leaving
Grozny to meander for hours through country lanes.
Russian forces who began a full-scale assault on Grozny on December 31
now hold the centre -- the president's palace and surrounding streets
and the railway station, with a supply route coming in from the north.
There is still fighting south of the Sunzha river for Minutka Square
and the bus station. Russians pounded two outlying districts overnight.
Chechen fighters told Reuter correspondent Nicholas Doughty they had
destroyed several tanks. This, like many claims and counter-claims in
the war, could not be confirmed.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent troops into Chechnya on December
11 to crush its three-year independence bid. But Chechens resisted
fiercely.--Reuter.

Gaza, Tuesday
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat today warned Islamic militants who killed
19 Israelis this week that their attacks could ruin the Palestinian
dream of statehood.
Under pressure from Israel to curb the attacks, Arafat was weighing
tough measures against the Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups in self-ruled
Gaza and Jericho, including disarming activists, his aides said.
Israel handed over Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho to
Palestinian rule in May and is negotiating with the PLO the expansion of
self-rule to other parts of the West Bank, captured in 1967 and home to
a million Palestinians.
''Every time we are about to reach the West Bank, to take the West
Bank, a problem happens. This is not a coincidence,'' Arafat said in a
speech at a public gathering at a Gaza college.
Arafat said Israel was about to release more than a quarter of the
6000 Palestinians it holds prisoner before the attack.
But Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin suspended talks with the PLO on the
release after Islamic Jihad carried out the suicide bombing which killed
18 soldiers and a truck driver at a bus stop in central Israel on
Sunday.
Israel also blocked nearly 60,000 Palestinian labourers in Gaza and
the West Bank from entering the Jewish state.
Palestinians fear it may also delay talks on redeploying Israeli
troops in the West Bank and holding Palestinian elections -- the next
phases of their 1993 peace deal.--Reuter.
Patrick Borgan writes: President Clinton has ordered the assets of 12
suspected Middle East terrorist groups and 18 individuals frozen, in
reaction to the latest bombings in Israel.
The FBI believes that some of these groups, including Hamas and
Islamic Jihad, raise money from the large Arab community in the US and
use it for terrorist attacks in Israel and elsewhere.
The new presidential order permits the authorities to ban suspected
terrorists from entering the country.
This provision would have permitted the immigration service to refuse
admission to Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, who is the chief defendant in the
current New York bombing trial.

Sarajevo, Tuesday
BIG power mediators met the rivals in the Bosnian conflict separately
today to push for a peace settlement as a truce held throughout the
republic.
The United Nations said fighting was tapering off even in the
northwestern Bihac enclave where battles raged over the weekend. The
truce came into force on January 1 for four months
Against such an encouraging backdrop, peace envoys from Russia,
Britain, France and Germany joined US diplomat Charles Thomas to meet
Bosnian government leaders and later the Bosnian Serbs.
Thomas has spent the past two days shuttling between Sarajevo and
nearby Serb stronghold of Pale to gauge the mood for fresh negotiations
to end nearly three years of war.
The contact group, which drew up a peace plan for Bosnia last July,
sought to reassure the Bosnian government that their commitment to the
original peace blueprint was firm.
The group is trying to revive peace talks on the plan, which would
divide Bosnia almost evenly between rebel Serbs and a government-backed
federation of Muslims and Croats.
The Serbs, who hold 70% of Bosnia, want big changes to the map. The
government has accepted its 51% share but rules out peace talks unless
the Serbs accept 49%.
The map, unveiled six months ago as an unconditional deal backed by
warnings of Nato intervention against any party that rejected it, is now
described by the contact group as a ''basis for new negotiations''.
That has raised Bosnian government suspicions that the Big Powers are
ready to rework the map to appease the Serbs, whose ability to paralyse
UN aid operations in Bosnia keeps Nato at bay. This has been denied by
the contact group.
Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic said peace hinged on the Serbs.
''Once the Karadzic Serbs accept the peace plan of the contact group,
then of course the government of Bosnia will be ready for
negotiations,'' he said.
The envoys then drove off in a blizzard to the Bosnian Serb
headquarters at Pale for a meeting with Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and
his associates.
The UN said it was on the whole quiet in Bosnia today with no firing
incidents at all reported in Sarajevo and central and southwest
Bosnia.--Reuter.

Bolu, Turkey,
Wednesday
AN American airman and his 10-year-old son given up for dead in
snow-covered mountains in Turkey were found alive today after living on
snow for nine days.
''I thought we were going to die if they didn't find us this morning.
I was elated,'' Air Force Lieutenant-Colonel Mike Couillard, 37, told
Reuters from his hospital bed.
Couillard, stationed in Ankara, and his son Matthew sheltered in an
icy rock crevice in sub-zero temperatures feeding on snow, police said.
The two were rescued by villagers in Bolu, northwest Turkey, who found
the officer, exhausted in a forestry hut near their shelter, after a
high-tech search involving US troops and Turkish commandos failed to
spot them.
Doctors at the hospital said they were amazed the two had survived by
eating only snow in the icy temperatures. ''It is medically impossible
for them to survive for nine days,'' said one.
Couillard, smiling and dressed in a tracksuit, told how he left his
son in the crevice two days ago and skied down towards log cabins in the
distance to raise the alarm.
''Unfortunately, there were no people there and I didn't have any
energy to move,'' he said. He was found by a forestry worker and
villagers at the cabin this morning.
''I yelled and yelled and fortunately the people saw me,'' he said.
His rescuers later climbed up to the crevice and pulled out his son,
Couillard added.
The pair were found about nine miles from the Kartalkaya ski resort
where they got lost in fog on the 6000ft high mountains on January
15.--Reuter.

Boston, Tuesday
IN a symbolic end of an epoch, Rose Kennedy, mother of an American
president, wife of an ambassador and daughter of a Boston mayor, was
buried today after a funeral in the church where she was baptised more
than a century ago.
Over 100 Kennedy family members and some 800 invited guests attended
the funeral at Old St Stephen's Roman Catholic Church in Boston's, where
Rose Kennedy was born on July 22, 1890.
She died at her home in Hyannisport, Massachusetts on Sunday of
complications from pneumonia. She was 104.
A funeral cortege carried her body to Boston from Hyannisport on Cape
Cod for the funeral mass.
Her only surviving son, Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy, his voice
breaking with emotion, delivered the main eulogy.
''Jack once called her the glue that held the family together,'' he
told the congregation. ''Whatever any of us has done, whatever
contribution we have made begins and ends with Rose and Joseph Kennedy.
''For all of us, Dad was the spark, Mother was the light of our lives.
He was our greatest fan, she was our greatest teacher. Our dinner table
was her classroom and the subject was the whole world of human events.''
Cardinal Barnard Law, who led the mass, read aloud a telegram from
Pope John Paul II sending his blessing and condolences.
Also attending the funeral were Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al
Gore, representing President Bill Clinton's administration, and many
senators and congressmen.
Several of Rose Kennedy's grandchildren, including John Kennedy Jr,
Maria Shriver, William Kennedy Smith and Congressman Joseph Kennedy of
Massachusetts, delivered short readings.
After the funeral mass, the cortege bore the body to Holyhood cemetery
in Brookline, a Boston suburb, where the family attended a private
burial.
Others present included John and Caroline Kennedy, President Kennedy's
children; Robert Kennedy's widow, Ethel; Edward Kennedy's wife,
Victoria, and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, husband of journalist Maria
Shriver.
Mrs Kennedy's daughters Eunice Shriver, Patricia Kennedy Lawford and
Jean Kennedy Smith, the current US ambassador to Ireland, were also
present.
Rose Kennedy was buried beside her husband, Joseph Sr, a wealthy
banker and former US ambassador to Britain, who died in 1969.--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Tory chief loses libel claim over Nadir funds</HEADLINE>

A SENIOR Tory yesterday lost his claim that he was libelled in a
newspaper article which suggested Conservative Central Office obstructed
an inquiry into donations to party funds made by the fugitive tycoon,
Asil Nadir.
At the High Court in London, the jury took more than four hours to
decide by a majority of 10-2 that the September 1993 article in the
Guardian did not libel Mr Paul Judge, Tory director-general.
Mr Judge, 45 -- who now faces a bill for legal costs estimated at
#300,000 for the seven-day hearing -- and his wife Anne Marie, 48, of
Elmbridge, Worcestershire, looked stunned as the verdict was delivered.
He said later: ''It is clearly a very disappointing verdict, but I
think everything did come out in court which showed we acted perfectly
properly.''
He said no evidence was given which showed that he or Central Office
staff, for whom he was responsible, had acted in any way improperly.
Mr Campbell Page, the Guardian's executive editor, said: ''We are
obviously delighted that the Guardian has been vindicated.''
Mr Judge, who waived a #100,000 salary when he took on the job at
Conservative Central Office, had sought damages against the Guardian
newspaper, its editor Peter Preston, and journalists Paul Brown and
David Pallister.
Mr David Eady, QC, for Mr Judge, described the September 1993 article
as ''a piece of sensational, anti-Conservative scandal-mongering'' which
had damaged the director-general's character and reputation.
Mr Anthony Gray, QC, for the Guardian, said it was ''a substantially
correct story'' written without malice.
The article suggested that Mr Neil Cooper, head of the insolvency arm
of accountants Robson Rhodes, and the court-appointed joint trustee of
Mr Nadir's bankruptcy, was to give Central Office one last opportunity
to provide information voluntarily about donations -- or face court
action -- after weeks of prevarication.
The story also alleged that solicitors had been reduced to delivering
copies of letters by hand to Mr Judge at Smith Square, with accompanying
notes saying ''we hope this does not get lost between the front office
and your desk''.
The court was told that between 1985 and 1990, there were nine
donations to the Tories totalling #440,000. The money was received
through a National Westminster account in Jersey belonging to Unipac, a
subsidiary of Mr Nadir's company Polly Peck International, now in
receivership.
But there was speculation that more than #1m had been handed over by
Mr Nadir, now in the Turkish Republic of northern Cyprus after jumping
bail in May 1993.
Mr Cooper launched his inquiries because he might have had a claim on
any money if it was drawn on cheques from Mr Nadir's personal accounts
held with companies within the Polly Peck group.

ORANGE growers know it as ''the terminator''. Unless it is checked, it
could spell the end for Britain's breakfast marmalade.
The terminator is a voracious insect which is devouring leaves of
citrus trees across south-east Spain, leaving farmers worried about the
future. Citrus production brings in #1200m annually to Spain and
provides life-blood to local economies from the straits of Gibraltar to
Barcelona.
The country's orange producers say it is too early to gauge the havoc
the tiny white fly, phylocnistis citrella, has wreaked and its impact on
future harvests.
''At the moment its seems it's just aesthetic damage,'' said Leandro
Gonzalez, agriculture official for the Huelva regional government.
''What I mean by that is that it has only damaged leaves. We won't see
its full impact on fruit production until three or four harvests from
now.
''I know people have come up with figures for production losses, but I
don't know how. This is an insect that attacks leaves, not fruit, so
it's impossible to say how serious it is just yet.''
The food industry in Britain, where marmalade production depends on
Seville oranges, is also on guard against ''the terminator''.
So far the industry has been unaffected. A spokesman for Baxter's of
Speyside said they had been reassured by their supplier in Spain that
there had been no big difference in yields this year.
A spokeswoman for Robertson's marmalades also played down any
suggestion of a threat to British production. ''It is something we are
aware of, but it is not perceived as a huge threat,'' she said.
However, orange growers know they cannot afford to sit back and do
nothing. The terminator has a healthy appetite and is not a fussy eater.
''It has no preference. It eats the leaves of all citrus fruits,'' Mr
Gonzalez said. ''As with all new plagues, this one has caused a great
deal of alarm. It's sure to provoke a lot of panic because, at the
moment, we know very little about it.''
This week Huelva, in Spain's south-west corner, held a summit of
regional experts to hammer out a common policy to combat the insect,
which has spread rapidly since its arrival 18 months ago.
''It hit first in Andalucia in 1993 and reached here last year,'' said
Jesus Gimenez, agriculture official in Valencia which lies at the heart
of Spain's orange production. ''But we've no idea where it came from
originally.''

<HEADLINE>British detective scornful of raid at Waco</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>3</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>980189461</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE raid which started the 51-day siege at a religious cult's
headquarters in Waco, Texas, failed because of inept planning, flawed
intelligence, and a lack of subterfuge, according to a senior British
policeman.
The inquest into the 23 Britons who died heard a scathing criticism
yesterday of the whole operation from Detective Chief Inspector Albert
Yates.
He told the Manchester hearing there were no contingency plans made
and the senior planners of the federal bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms (ATF) should have called it off when they knew the element of
surprise was lost.
Communications failed as 76 heavily-armed officers raided the Mount
Carmel compound of the Branch Davidian cult headed by David Koresh.
The operation on February 28, 1993, was supposed to be ''highly
sensitive'', yet the ATF had booked 153 rooms in three local hotels for
the night following the raid. ''It shows there was really not a great
deal of subterfuge going into the planning of this operation,'' said Mr
Yates, who headed a team from Greater Manchester Police which
investigated the events.
The raid's aim was to arrest Koresh, whose followers had talked of him
impregnating 400 virgins after claiming he was the ''Sinful Messiah'',
and recover hundreds of firearms and two million rounds of stockpiled
ammunition.
The ATF had mounted an undercover operation since January, keeping
watch on the compound. Yet between then and the raid, in which 75 cult
members eventually died, Koresh had left the compound eight times,
travelled to Dallas and visited local shops, said Mr Yates. ''Why he
wasn't arrested I am afraid I don't know.''
Local media knew the raid was taking place, the news had been leaked
to people inside the compound and on the morning it happened an
80-strong convoy of military vehicles was seen leaving a base nearby, he
said.
''The critical factor was the element of surprise,'' he said, but when
the man in charge knew it was lost he told them to go ahead. ''That left
their colleagues very vulnerable with grievous consequences.''
He said three helicopters intended as a diversion, one of them
carrying the raid commander, were late.
No thought was given to communications: at the height of the gun
battle a man in the local sheriff's office was left to talk to Koresh
after he phoned from inside the compound.
The raid was based on incorrect information that all weapons in the
compound were stored in a room. It was later learned some cult members
slept with AK47 assault rifles under their beds, said Mr Yates.
The bungled operation led to a series of resignations, including that
of the ATF's director, deputy director and associate director. The
officer in charge of the raid was dismissed last month.
The inquest also heard that Koresh, 33, claimed he was the ''Sinful
Messiah'' and had the right to impregnate young women as part of his
religious function. He had advocated multiple sex partners, at least for
himself, according to Professor Albert Waite, principal lecturer at the
Seventh Day Adventist's Newbold College in Bracknell, Berkshire.
The professor, who lectured in chemistry at the college where two of
the Waco victims were students, added: ''Koresh said he himself would
fulfil the prophecy of the second coming of Christ.''
The inquest continues.

A HIGHLAND family yesterday joined the campaign to free Lee Clegg, the
Parachute Regiment private who was jailed for life for shooting dead a
teenager in Northern Ireland when the car she was travelling in went
through an Army checkpoint.
Scots Guard Paul Brown, 21, faced a similar situation weeks before the
fatal shooting four years ago. But he did not fire.
His family say this decision cost him his life, for the car ploughed
into the father-of-two and killed him.
Paul's father, John, 54, a Glasgow-born welding supervisor, of 19
Birchwood Road, Inshes Wood, Inverness, said: ''I just wish Lee Clegg
had been with Paul and his mates at that Londonderry checkpoint that
day. If Clegg had been there, I'm sure my son would be alive today.''
Private Brown's widow, Emma, 28, of West MacKenzie Park, Inverness,
said: ''Clegg and his colleagues at the roadblock would be on edge,
knowing what had happened to Paul only a short time before. Even though
it was a different regiment, it would be common knowledge.''
Mrs Brown, mother of Paul junior, six, and Samantha, now four, added:
''Under the circumstances I can quite understand them loosing off shots
at their particular car, even after it went through the roadblock.
''For all they knew, when the car stopped terrorists might have
spilled out and started firing at them.
''I can also understand the anguish of Lee Clegg's family, having to
face up to his being jailed for life for just doing his duty.''
Paul's brother Allen, 32, an oilfield services manager in the Middle
East, said at his parents' home: ''Paul was the 'baby' of my mum and
dad's five children.
''And my mother, Aileen, is all for Clegg's release, but she cannot
bring herself to talk about it. She would just burst into tears. Paul's
death is too fresh in her mind.
''My parents, who moved north from Glasgow 14 years ago, visit Paul's
grave in the local Kilvean cemetery every Sunday.
''He must have had a premonition. For, when he left for Northern
Ireland that last time, he told us he would not be seeing us again. Of
course, we just scoffed.
''As for Lee Clegg and his mates, they were in a tense situation. They
were only doing their job when they fired at the car.
''It was sad the girl and her boyfriend were killed, but the Paras
were not to know they were just a pair of daft teenagers in a stolen
car.''
The family said that the driver of the car that killed Paul, who was
also a drummer and bugler in the Scots Guards, received only a
''paltry'' 18 months' jail sentence.

<HEADLINE>Crash victim said to have planned to maim insurance executives Court told of #1m plot to blackmail</HEADLINE>

A CAR crash victim planned to obtain #1m from his insurance company by
murdering and maiming their senior executives, an Old Bailey jury heard
yesterday.
John Grainger, 53, made one fatal mistake in his ''ruthless and
calculated scheme''. The man he hired to carry out his bidding was an
undercover policeman, who secretly tape recorded everything Mr Grainger
said.
''Unfortunately for him, the person he tried to recruit was an
undercover police officer, wired up for sound,'' said Mr Michael
Austin-Smith, QC, prosecuting counsel. He said that tape recordings of
conversations between the undercover officer known as Martin and Mr
Grainger revealed that he was prepared to resort to murder to get the
#1m to which he felt he was entitled.
Mr Grainger, an unemployed property developer, of Great Yeldham,
Essex, denies soliciting to murder, incitment to cause grevious bodily
harm, and incitement to blackmail between March 3 and 7 last year.
Counsel said that Mr Grainger was in a car that was struck from behind
by a lorry on April 19, 1991. It was not his fault and his insurers,
General Accident, acknowledged that fact.
Mr Grainger suffered whiplash injuries, and after much wrangling was
paid #250,000 by the insurers. Mr Grainger had embarked on a publicity
campaign threatening to starve himself to death and live in a car until
they paid him #1m.
He was thrown out of the company's headquarters in Perth and a
restraining order was taken out against him.
He claimed he was entitled to #1m because he had lost hundreds of
thousands of pounds through not being able work due to the injury he
suffered.
Mr Austin-Smith said that his profits in the year before the accident
were only #6000 and the building industry was in recession. That is why
the insurers did not accept his figures.
He accepted the #250,000 but warned the company's legal
representatives as he signed for it: ''The fight goes on.''
He became a shareholder of General Accident and was able to attend
meetings. He received a diary with the names of all the top people in
the company. He had access to the names of the directors and went to
Companies House to get their adresses.
He drew up a hit list in Scotland, the South of England, and elsewhere
of people associated at the highest level with the company, said
counsel.
The first man he recruited let him down and failed to carry out his
order to firebomb the company. He was then put in touch with the
undercover officer.
He unwittingly told the officer in taped conversations: ''If someone
goes and puts paint on a director's car I don't think they would take
any notice. But if, let's say I did something terrible, say I killed
someone. I think the harder you go in the greater the chances of it
working.''
The court heard that he at first intended to kneecap or break the legs
of an executive and let them know it was to do with his insurance claim.
But the attackers would tell the victim that they were owed money by the
defendant.
''They would be ruthless people who would stop at nothing to get Mr
Grainger to pay his debt to them,'' said counsel.
The jury was told that Mr Grainger felt that this would put him in the
clear when police investigated the crimes.
''Grainger was cold, cool, ruthless, calculated and determined. He had
his plan and all he needed was a hit man to execute it,'' said Mr
Austin-Smith.
The court heard that the policeman pretended to carry out a hit and
told Mr Grainger that he had shot company director Mr A D Grant in the
leg with a .22 gun.
''Mr Grant lived in Essex and was one of the men on the hit list,''
said counsel.
Mr Grainger's reaction on being told of the shooting was: ''You have
made me a happy man. I am delighted with that. That's lovely. Gone to
hospital has he?'' Counsel said that the defendant then laughed.
Mr Grainger then indicated that if he did not hear from the insurance
company by the weekend he wanted to go for the ''full SP'', a ''bullet
in the head''.
''You may think it was providence that the man he had unwittingly
hired was an undercover officer,'' said counsel.
''The Crown say this was real and serious. It was luck alone that Mr
Grant and others were not subjected to the sort of fate the defendant
was prepared to so callously deal out to them,'' said Mr Austin-Smith.
The trial continues.

A COALITION of Scotland's leading conservation bodies yesterday urged
the Scottish Office to appoint a key official to co-ordinate the
Government's programme on protecting Scotland's most threatened species
and habitats before it was too late.
Mr Stuart Housden, chairman of the Scottish Biodiversity Action Group,
said yesterday that Government progress since it launched a Biodiversity
Action Plan last year had been slower than conservationists would have
wished.
''Many habitats and species in Scotland and the rest of the UK are
still in decline, and the longer we wait the harder it is going to be,
and in some cases it may even be too late,'' said Mr Housden, who is the
director in Scotland of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
While UK conservation groups launched their Biodiversity Challenge: an
agenda for conservation action in the UK alongside the Environment
Secretary, Mr John Gummer, Scottish conservationists launched a Scottish
supplement to the document giving Scottish examples of threatened
species and habitats where urgent remedial action is called for.
''They had John Gummer launching the initiative in London. We really
do expect to see ministerial support in Scotland,'' said Mr Housden.
The Biodiversity Challenge claims that UK expenditure on nature
conservation is modest compared with the billions of pounds spent
supporting agriculture and road construction.The report also sets
targets for more than 600 species and 35 habitats.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said: ''We welcome any document of
this kind and will study it with interest.''

DETECTIVES were last night hunting killers who viciously murdered two
men who were partners in a garage business.
Mr Antonio Marrocco, 48, an Italian motor trader, was found battered
to death early yesterday at TM Motors, in Northgate, Morecambe,
Lancashire.
Hours later, as detectives were still organising their murder hunt, Mr
Marrocco's partner in the business, Mr Peter Sandham, 28, was found dead
with head injuries in a field a mile-and-a-half away.
One theory being considered by police was that the men were murdered
for the hundreds of pounds they would have been carrying to bid at a
local motor auction yesterday. Detectives are also trying to establish
if someone had a grudge against the pair.
Mr Marrocco, who came to Britain in 1965, lived with his wife
Geraldine in Heysham. Their son Adrian, 23, is serving in the RAF.
Mr Sandham and his wife Susan lived in Bolton-le-Sands. He was
recovering after recent chemotherapy treatment for cancer.
Their families became concerned when the pair did not return from the
garage on Monday night, and reported them missing to police. Officers
entered the garage at 1.30am yesterday and found Mr Marrocco's body.
Detective Chief Superintendent Bill Hacking said: ''Mr Marrocco had
suffered numerous injuries to most parts of his body, and particularly
his head.''
A farmer tending his livestock found Mr Sandham's body in a field near
Lancaster and Morecambe crematorium. He too had suffered head injuries.
Staff at business premises next to the garage heard shouting and
banging at about 6pm on Monday, and police believe this was probably
when the killers struck.

ALL five members of crew on a fishing trawler were airlifted to safety
yesterday, after their vessel began sinking five miles west of Cape
Wrath in Sutherland.
The captain of the trawler, who was the last to be rescued, left his
boat just two minutes before it sank. Last night, he said the incident
could have ended in tragedy if weather conditions had not been so
favourable.
The four crewmen from the Fraserburgh-registered Emulous were
airlifted by a Stornoway coastguard helicopter, and the skipper, Mr
Richard Cardno, was later rescued by Lochinver lifeboat in conditions
which the coastguard described as relatively calm.
The 55ft vessel, which had left Fraserburgh on Monday night and was 17
miles from fishing grounds off the Sutherland coast, made an emergency
call to Stornoway coastguard at about 3pm yesterday, after it began
taking on water following a pipe fracture.
A coastguard helicopter was despatched with two mobile water pumps and
was assisted by Lochinver lifeboat, a Fisheries Protection aircraft, and
the coastguard tug Brodosas Sun.
An all-vessels-broadcast was put out by the coastguard. The first to
answer, the Portuguese coaster Hubro, two miles from the scene, made its
way to the trawler and remained there until the rescue services arrived.
When the helicopter arrived the engine room was flooded and the decks
of the 20-year-old vessel were awash. The trawler sank at about 5.30pm,
just two minutes after Mr Cardno, 32, of Albert Street, Fraserburgh, had
been taken off.
The crewmen -- Mr Gavin Buchan, 23, and Mr Robert Kerr, 19, both from
Fraserburgh, Mr Jason Smith, 17, from St Combs, and Mr Paul Gavryluk,
23, from Cairnbulg -- were shaken by their ordeal but did not require
medical attention.
They were taken to the fishermen's mission in Lochinver, from where Mr
Cardno, who is married with a two-year-old son, described what happened.
''I was in my bed when the crew noticed the water coming in. When I
came up the water was on the floor of the engine room. We tried to clear
it but there was nothing we could do, the boat keeled over two minutes
after I was taken onto the lifeboat.''
He added:''We are all very grateful to the emergency services and are
also thankful that the weather was fairly good.
''If it had been a force four or five wind, coming from the north as
it was, there probably would have been a bit of a swell. If the boat had
been rolling I think it might have gone down quicker.''

TWO drug addicts who left an 84-year-old woman tied up after
brandishing a gun and a knife and robbing her were each jailed for 10
years yesterday.
Lord Morton told Scott Adamson and John Gordon, both 26, at the High
Court in Edinburgh yesterday that they both had appalling criminal
records.
The judge added: ''I think it is time the general population was
relieved of your presence.''
Adamson, of Granton Crescent, and Gordon, of West Pilton Grove, both
Edinburgh, had earlier admitted assaulting and robbing Mrs Muriel
Yarroll, a widow, in her home in the city's Balgreen Park.
Advocate-depute John Morris told the court that the two turned up at
Mrs Yarroll's home on October 6 last year and asked for directions to a
local golf course.
During the conversation they found out that she was at home alone.
Mrs Yarroll decided to call the police after they left because she was
suspicious.
The doorbell rang again and, thinking it was the police, Mrs Yarroll
opened it, only to find Adamson and Gordon. They forced open the door,
knocking her down.
Adamson pulled out a gun and demanded to know where she kept her
jewellery.
A search for valuables did not apparently produce enough to satisfy
them and Gordon produced a knife, wanting to know where she kept her
bag.
Mrs Yarroll was tied up with her own scarves before the robbers took
#356 in cash and some jewellery.
She managed to free herself and alert a neighbour.
The court heard that Adamson committed the crime to get more money to
fund his drug habit.
Mr Derek Ogg, defence counsel for Gordon, said it was ''a disgusting
offence'' which was regarded as low-life even among thieves.

A 24-YEAR-OLD woman will today appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court charged
with attempting to murder a seven-month-old baby girl at the city's
Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill on Sunday, January 15.
The alleged attack happened a week before the ''suspicious'' death of
two-year-old Christina Murtagh, who died on Sunday after being
discovered the previous day unconscious in a Yorkhill toilet cubicle.
Police said the two incidents were unconnected.
Officers investigating Christina's death said they were awaiting the
results of further tests after a post-mortem failed to determine the
cause of death.It will be several days until these analyses are
complete.
Christina's parents, Marie McGregor and John Murtagh, last night
demanded a full inquiry into her death.
Mr Murtagh said: ''I want to know how she found her way to the toilets
and why she was unsupervised.''
Christina was transferred to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children last
Thursday, suffering from ''funny turns'', after being initially treated
in the city's Southern General.
The child disappeared from her bed on Saturday as medical staff
attempted to find the cause of her ailment.
She was found, minutes later, unconscious on the toilet floor, and was
immediately placed on a life support machine. She died at about one
o'clock on Sunday afternoon.
Last night hospital spokesman Richard Morgan denied any negligence by
staff in either of the two incidents.
Mr Morgan added that legal difficulties prevented him from elaborating
further.

NEARLY 100 Tory MPs are demanding the release of paratrooper Private
Lee Clegg from his life sentence for murder.
Led by Mr Julian Brazier, vice-chairman of the Tory Defence Committee,
they have signed a Commons motion demanding a change in the law to
prevent similar cases and to clarify the position for the 19,000 British
soldiers serving in Northern Ireland.
Home Secretary Michael Howard announced he would review the law
governing the use of weapons by soldiers and police officers.
The Prime Minister is taking a personal interest in the case of
Private Clegg, convicted of the murder of Ms Karen Reilly, the passenger
of a joyrider who had driven through a road block in Northern Ireland.
Campaigners for his release say there is fresh evidence he did not
fire the fatal bullet. However, with the peace process at stake, it
could be months before any release.
The paratrooper's case now returns to the Northern Ireland courts
following the dismissal of his appeal against conviction by the House of
Lords.
The Law Lords recommended that the Home Secretary should review the
situation to see whether the charge of murder could be reduced to
manslaughter in such cases. The Home Secretary responded to this
yesterday in a written Commons answer to Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman
of the Tory Defence Committee.
Any changes in the law could not be retrospective and would not apply
to Private Clegg.
The Prime Minister was questioned in the Commons yesterday about the
case of Private Clegg, who was one of eight soldiers who opened fire at
the stolen car. Nineteen bullets hit the car, and Clegg fired four of
them.
Mr Major, conscious of the current ceasefire, said Ministers should
not comment on the actions of the courts, but added: ''There have been
suggestions in recent days that there is fresh evidence which might cast
doubt on Private Clegg's conviction.''
The Clegg case can be reopened in Northern Ireland. ''This will
include consultations with the trial judge and with the Lord Chief
Justice of Northern Ireland, Sir Brian Hutton, and will take into
account the nature of the offence. I know that Sir Patrick Mayhew
(Northern Ireland Secretary) will ensure that this process is undertaken
both effectively and with due care.''
Sir Patrick issued a statement on Monday night indicating he had the
power to release Clegg from his life sentence, on licence, with the
possibility of his being returned to his Army unit. There is a precedent
for this concerning a soldier who shot a suspected terrorist in the
back.
Sir Patrick will not intervene until the due processes of law have
been gone through. In about a month's time London and Dublin are
expected to agree a new joint framework document to carry forward the
ceasefire into serious political negotiations for a settlement.
At Westminster it appeared unlikely that Clegg could be freed until
the Government was sure it would not endanger the chances of a permanent
political settlement.
An outcry from republicans could damage the whole peace process. At
the same time the Prime Minister, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and
Sir Patrick have to handle the growing demand for a review of the Clegg
case because of the fear an injustice has been done.
Mr Brazier said: ''We want to get Lee Clegg out, but beyond that we
want to change the law to get the rules of engagement embodied into the
law by Parliament.'' This involves the ''yellow card'' which every
soldier carries, specifying when and how he may shoot on the streets of
Northern Ireland.
This raises difficult legal problems. The Home Secretary's review of
the law will include the ''yellow card'' and whether it is possible to
reduce a murder charge in these circumstances to manslaughter. Army
generals have stood out against such a change in the law because they
fear it would encourage more prosecutions against their soldiers.
The Commons motion signed by nearly 100 MPs last night calls on the
Government to ''embody the rules of engagement into the criminal law so
that charges can never again be brought against soldiers who open fire
under circumstances conforming to them''.
So far Labour leader Tony Blair and his team have not taken a stance
on the matter. Liberal Democrat leader, Mr Paddy Ashdown, who served in
Northern Ireland as a Royal Marine officer, told the Prime Minister in
the Commons that Clegg's convictions is ''shamefully inappropriate.''

MOORS murderer Myra Hindley can be hypnotised in an attempt to find
the body of victim Keith Bennett, Prisons Minister Michael Forsyth said
last night.
Keith's mother, Mrs Winnie Johnson, was told of his decision at a
meeting at the Home Office.
She believes hypnosis is the only way to find the body, which is
buried somewhere on Saddleworth Moor, near Manchester.
Hindley, 52, is serving a life sentence for her part in the Moors
murders in the early 1960s.
''All these years I have been fighting to give my son a proper
burial,'' said Mrs Johnson, 61. ''It's now hopeful, after nearly 31
years.''
Mr Forsyth said in a statement that he had been anxious to meet Mrs
Johnson and her family to discuss Hindley's application for hypnosis.
''In the light of the wishes of the family, Mr Forsyth has agreed that
the hypnotism can go ahead,'' the statement said.
Mr Forsyth added: ''Mrs Johnson and her family were victims of a
terrible crime. I have been moved by their arguments and, although
expert opinion suggests that hypnosis might not provide the positive
results that they are hoping for, I want to be sure that we have done
everything we can to help them in their quest to find Keith's body.''
There was no information on whether Mrs Johnson's wish to have Hindley
take a truth drug was discussed at the meeting.
Nor was there any indication of when the hypnosis would take place.
Keith, 12, was killed by Hindley and her lover Ian Brady in 1964, but
it was not until 20 years later that they admitted their part in his
death.
In 1987, Hindley was taken to Saddleworth Moor, but failed to identify
the spot where he was buried.
Mrs Johnson, who has eight other children and 23 grandchildren, said
she thought Hindley had agreed to be hypnotised to win support for her
campaign to be freed after 29 years in jail.
''Having spoken to the Minister, he warned me it could result in
nothing. But I am prepared to take it either way. Whether it is going to
do any good or not, at least I have tried.''
She added: ''As far as I know, Myra Hindley is prepared to undergo
hypnosis. She wants it done, but of course she could change her mind.
''But I have got further than I have done in all these years and I am
very grateful. It's put me on cloud nine at the moment.''
Mrs Johnson said that, if hypnosis failed, she would press for Hindley
to take a truth drug.
''I have got to take a step at a time,'' she said. ''The Minister said
it's got to be done in the correct way.''
A Home Office spokeswoman said that Hindley would have to undergo a
medical and psychological examination before being hypnotised --
probably by a psychologist appointed by the Home Office.
If Hindley, who is serving her sentence at Cookham Wood jail in Kent,
is found fit to undergo hypnosis, Manchester police officers who
originally investigated the murders will be consulted to help the
hypnotist prepare the questions to be put to her.
Hindley's solicitor, Mr Andrew McCooey, said: ''Myra Hindley has
always made it clear to Mrs Johnson that she is willing to do all she
can do to help locate the body of Keith Bennett and if, as a last
resort, it would help her remember she would be willing to undergo
hypnosis.''
Mrs Johnson, who visits Saddleworth Moor every weekend, has previously
asked the Home Office to allow Hindley to take a truth drug.
Her request was refused in 1993.

LABOUR launched another attack on executive pay rises yesterday, with
fresh allegations of #1m windfalls, as the chief executive of British
Gas, Mr Cedric Brown, defended his recent 75% pay increase.
The issue provoked an angry clash at Question Time between the Prime
Minister and Labour leader Tony Blair, who accused boardroom chiefs of
hitting the jackpot week after week at the public's expense as they
awarded themselves National Lottery-style wage increases.
Mr Major warned that the Labour leader was becoming a ''slave to
grievance politics''.
The Institute of Directors weighed in with a report that said
executives should face pay cuts if their performance falls below certain
standards.
The IOD published a framework for disclosing information about
executives' pay in an attempt to counter claims of ''fat cat bosses''
being given large salary increases. Director general Tim Melville-Ross
suggested they could ''endanger the capitalist system itself''.
The chief who provoked the storm, meanwhile, was questioned for more
than an hour by the Commons Employment Select Committee. Mr Brown
defended the pay increase he had been given -- #205,000 per year to
#475,000 -- but admitted under questioning by the Labour chairman of the
committee, Mr Greville Janner, that his pay announcement should have
been handled differently.
Mr Brown was also involved in heated exchanges with Labour MP Angela
Eagle.
She challenged him on the amount British Gas showroom workers earned,
#10,000 to #13,000 a year plus commission, and asked how Mr Brown would
react if the British Gas renumeration committee came up with a
suggestion that he should work for that amount.
Mr Brown argued that pay differentials were a fact of life and told
the committee: ''The whole question of fairness and differentials is
politics and I am not a politician. We have to live in the world of the
market and we have to look at the complexity of the challenges of the
job and at the whole range of other companies in the UK.
''We have to compete with loads of other companies and our aim is to
pay the market rate for the job. Everyone, and all discussions I have
had with the trade unions over the years, understands differentials on a
whole range of different levels.''
He agreed with the IOD line that there should be more openness about
pay increases for top executives, but he made clear he was proud to have
gone from the bottom to the top in British Gas -- ''I have wielded a
pick and shovel'' -- and said that if shareholders did not like the
level of renumeration it was up to them to exert their influence.
The new Labour claims were that two electricity chiefs, Mr Edmund
Wallis of PowerGen and Mr John Baker of National Power received more
than #1m each last year in pay and share options.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said there was ''evidence of
astronomical pay rises in the boardrooms of the privatised utilities
unrelated to performance and unjustified by the service the companies
provide. The Government could have prevented these abuses happening in
the first place and could act now to stop them continuing.''
At Question Time, after Mr Blair's Lottery taunt, Mr Major challenged
the Labour leader to ''decide whether new Labour believes in the free
market or whether it believes in controls and the politics of envy.''
He insisted: ''The truth is that the language is new but the
prejudices are familiar.''
The other opposition parties added their own criticism. Liberal
Democrat spokesman Malcolm Bruce called on the Government to institute
regular reports on executive pay to shareholders and said: ''The
Government has been pathetic in its failure to condemn the rises in the
gas and electricity industries.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond confirmed that he and others would be seeking
to challenge British Gas directors at the annual general meeting later
this year, and said: ''At the end of the day, the actions of British Gas
are indicative of a spiv society created by the Tories.''

<HEADLINE>Israel plans barrier to keep out Palestinians</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ISRAEL was yesterday preparing to build a solid barrier between West
Bank Palestinians and Jews in a furious reaction to Sunday's suicide
bombing.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin promised a programme to separate the two
groups within months.
A Cabinet minister earlier called for a border fence to be built
between Israel and the West Bank.
''I intend to appoint a committee to begin to gradually implement the
idea of separation,'' Mr Rabin said.
An Islamic suicide bombing killed 18 Israeli soldiers and a civilian
in central Israel at the weekend.
Yesterday Mr Rabin told Israelis: ''We must get ready by preparing a
programme which will take a month or two to prepare. I don't want to go
into technical details. A fence throughout is not a must.''
The idea of a fence to keep Palestinian militants out of Israel came
from Environment Minister Yossi Sarid.
''The fence will be for security, of course,'' he told army radio.
''But it will also be a demographic fence to divide us from them.''
Nabil Shaath, a senior adviser to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, said
that separation was only acceptable as part of the creation of a
Palestinian state, an idea which Israel officially opposes.
The PLO chief himself warned Islamic militants that their attacks
could ruin the Palestinian dream of statehood.
