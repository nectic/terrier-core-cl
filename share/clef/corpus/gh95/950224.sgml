Margaret Vaughan examines a report which suggests that the Government
has failed to put its money where its mouth is on family values
THERE is a crude mismatch between the rhetoric and the reality of
clarion calls to restore something called family values. The latest
report* from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation exposes the gulf between
mouth and money.
It warns that the perceived need to sustain families -- of whatever
variety -- has not been matched by positive policies to support parents
rearing the next generation. On the contrary.
There has been a policy drift away from recognising the costs and
demands of parenthood, notably in taxation. A married couple with two
children on the average male wage, for example, contribute 12.9% more of
gross earnings in direct tax than 30 years ago.
Policies on taxation, benefits, employment and housing all offer a
practical test of whether political rhetoric is matched by
family-friendly action: ''Much of the evidence is negative, suggesting
policy drift under successive governments away from recognising the
costs and demands of parenthood,'' is the report's bald conclusion.
Its thrust is that there is an urgent need for Government to
strengthen family life -- of whatever shape -- and support parents
raising the next generation. That makes a refreshing change.
While the farce of Ministers getting facial hernias feigning sincerity
about the sanctity of the family unit, while being economical with their
own actualite, eventually muted the family values row, it is sadly the
case that the stigma it heaped on lone-parents has stuck. And it
continues to inform debate.
The Rowntree foundation is an independent, non-political body which
funds research and development in the fields of social policy. Its last
report exposed the widening divide between rich and poor. For this
latest investigation it brought together policy-makers, researchers,
practitioners and academics to consider the changing circumstances of
families.
The threads of the discussions and the findings of research studies
are drawn together in the report to expose the gap between the
policy-makers' oratory and the reality.
It points out that the Government's own figures show that growing
numbers of families with children have moved towards the bottom of the
net income distribution. The number of children living in families with
less than half average income rose from 10% in 1979 to 32% in 1991/92.
That means nearly three million more children growing up in poverty.
As visions go, it appears that the Conservative crusade to take us
back to a mythical time and place where a permed mummy polished up the
lino in the lobby, dad was down the allotment, and 2.4 children gathered
round the radio to listen to Children's Hour and imbibe mugs of Ovaltine
was, in reality, about the mingiest and least inspiring that can be
imagined.
The report says forecasts of the demise of the ''traditional family''
are exaggerated. Seven out of 10 families with dependent children are
still headed by both parents.
But, looking at changing family patterns, it notes that marriage rates
are at their lowest level since records began 150 years ago; one in
three births occur outside marriage; one in four new marriages will end
in divorce, and one in five families with dependent children are headed
by a lone parent, compared with one in 12 in 1971.
Author David Utting questions whether enough is done to support
parents and to limit the adverse consequences of family discord and
breakdown. Research, he said, shows that far more could be done to
prevent the stress and adversity, which is diminishing the lives of
parents and children, through early intervention before crises arise.
Following the 1993 UN Year of the Family -- which on the evidence of
this report was about as effective as National Prune Week in forging UK
policy -- what is needed are co-ordinated policies in central and local
government to strengthen the way that families, in all their different
sizes and shapes, are able to live: ''In that way the flow of rhetoric
about the family may, at last, be matched by effective action,'' Utting
stressed.
The report points to evidence -- still contentious -- that children
who experience the breakdown of their parents' relationship run added
risks of adverse educational, health and behavioural outcomes compared
with those from families which remain intact. There is, though, no
inevitable path down which children will travel following divorce.
Research supports the view that conflict between parents before,
during and after separation is among the more significant adverse
infuences on children.
The report says families are places where the risks of adversity can
multiply for socially and emotionally disadvantaged children. But timely
support can reap substantial rewards. Preventive services can not only
avert impending crises, but avoid the need for later, more expensive,
intervention. More Government support is urged for a spectrum of
projects ranging from parent education services, to intensive family
preservation projects, and more family mediation.
It points out that the wider provision of family support services,
identified by the 1989 Children Act as a means of preventing family
breakdown and child abuse, has not been achieved.
Of Government, it asks whether it is acceptable that the tax regime
for parents with children has grown less favourable, and urges action to
help parents on benefits who want paid work to escape the tax-benefit
trap.

THE Cabinet decided yesterday that the Ulster Unionists must be given
leeway to formulate a new policy about the future of Northern Ireland.
Mr Michael Ancram MP, the Government's negotiator, has been sanctioned
to find a way to help the Unionists out of their problems following
Wednesday's announcement of the London-Dublin initiative.
Today Mr Jim Molyneaux -- who is still the vital element of Ulster
opinion as far as the Government is concerned -- is holding a meeting of
his party executive in Belfast to thrash out not only a considered
response to London-Dublin, but to formulate their own new policy for
1995.
Mr Ancram's task will be to keep an open door to the Unionists to help
them prevent a popular Protestant backlash in Northern Ireland.
Mr Ancram is already emphasising that, the principle of the consent of
the majority of people in Northern Ireland, is the base line, as far as
the Government is concerned for establishing constitutional negotiations
between the Unionists and Sinn Fein.
But the Ulster Unionists are shattered by the all-Ireland elements in
the joint framework document.

A FORMER president of the National Farmers Union of Scotland, John
Cameron, has added his voice to those saying that farmers have little to
fear from the next round of changes in the European Common Agricultural
Policy.
Mr Cameron, one of Europe's major farmers and a former Scottish
executive member of the board of British Rail, said that some
commentators had asserted that current levels of spending were not
sustainable.
''Through my involvement with ScotRail I know that the total Scottish
farming support budget does not come close to the amount of public
resources spent on keeping the rural railways running -- and you don't
hear anyone telling the transport minister that too much is being spent
there,'' he told a conference in Perth organised by the Institute of
Agricultural Engineers.
His view was that Scottish farmers could look forward to a fairly
secure future in the short to medium term at least, with support levels
remaining buoyant.
Adopting the line which has been taken by agriculture ministers both
north and south of the Border Mr Cameron said: ''True, some of the
criteria for eligibility and rates of assistance might change, but the
fact that the CAP reform allowed a GATT agreement to be reached -- for
the first time ever on agriculture -- means that major changes are not
on the cards.''
Similar expressions of optimism were made at an arable farming
''planning for profit'' meeting in Kelso.
However, the advice from Keith Norman, technical director of the
Velcourt Group, was not to rely on continuing subsidies but to keep
trying to produce a better tonnage per hectare. ''That is the only way
to stay profitable,'' he cautioned. ''You can always improve the bottom
line by producing more.''
With projected world population increases the future looked optimistic
for north European producers of wheat, he said.
Duncan Homan, deputy head of agricultural services with Barclays Bank,
introduced a note of caution with his view that the present scenario
could not last indefinitely. ''High cereal prices are bound to fall,''
he said. He too subscribed to the view that major changes to the present
CAP system were unlikely.
''There will be tinkering. There will be some concern over the size of
businesses receiving payments and there will a call for environmental
links,'' he said. No matter what our politicians might think of it he
did not envisage a major reform of the agricultural policy.
On the Continent, the general view -- of the public not just the
politicians -- was that they got value for money from the CAP, he said.
They were rather less critical.
His advice to UK farmers was ''Watch your overhead costs. Don't take
your eye off the ball and keep driving your business forward.''

POLITICIANS are often their own worst enemies. It was their behaviour
which destroyed the fiction that all MPs are honourable men. A hangover
from the days when the Commons was an extension of London's clubland, it
had served them well until the Poulson affair and subsequent allegations
about six unnamed Labour MPs for hire resulted in 1975 in the
establishment of the Register of Members Interests. Parliament decided
in a free vote that a mandatory declaration of outside interests held in
a register overseen by a select committee, instead of the traditional
verbal disclosure when making a speech or asking a question, was a
better safeguard against corruption.
operests. The recent cash-for-questions row showed how easily people
can be led into dubious behaviour, and how little had changed. The
register, the 1995 edition of which was published yesterday, has worked
well enough as a piece of self-regulation, but what it discloses is
often so trivial or vaguely phrased that suspicions persist. As the song
says -- is that all there is?
The time has come for some genuinely impartial oversight. Lord Nolan,
whose Committee on Standards in Public Life ended its hearings
yesterday, made clear from the outset, most unusually, that his report,
due in May, will not offer a comfortable defence of the status quo,
whether it be of MPs' behaviour, that of Ministers, or of persons
appointed to public bodies. Just as the register sets out what MPs are
expected to reveal, there are rules governing what a Minister may do,
both in office and on leaving office, which the Prime Minister has
published. Mr David Hunt, the Citizen's Charter Minister, giving
evidence to Nolan, argued that the status quo met public concern and
there was no need to change the rules just because of some outrageous
allegations against ex-Ministers who take jobs. Mr Hunt should get his
head out of the sand. The status quo will not do. Politicians, like
Caesar's wife, should be above suspicion. Ministers should not use their
substantial powers of patronage for party political ends. On leaving
office they should not end up instantly in jobs where expertise acquired
through office is the only reason for the appointment. A lawyer
returning to the Bar is one thing, a career politician ending up in the
City is another. Sir Norman Fowler and Lord Younger told Nolan there
should be a time limit for Ministers similar to that applied to senior
civil servants taking jobs with companies they have been associated with
while in the public service. Their advice should be heeded, even if
extra-parliamentary supervision dents Parliament's abundant self-esteem.
Select committees like to claim an Olympian omniscience, but the reality
is often quite different. As for the buck stopping with Ministers, while
that may have been true in the past -- Lord Carrington's resignation as
Foreign Secretary after the Falklands invasion is the last example of
the highest standards being applied -- when the buck stops today it
seems merely a temporary irritant, not grounds for resignation.

PRINCE Naseem Hamed, of Sheffield, due to meet Argentina's Sergio
Liendo at Livingston on March 4, was in Glasgow yesterday to announce
plans in which he could become a double world champion in the summer --
and revealed that a showdown between himself and World Boxing
Organisation featherweight champion Steve Robinson, of Wales, should be
held in Scotland.
Hamed, the World Boxing Council International super-bantamweight
champion intends to take the WBC's full blown world title by challenging
Wilfredo Vasquez in his home city in June, then plans on stepping up in
weight to try and dethrone Robinson the following month.
Hamed also confirmed a report in Monday's Herald that he was likely to
relinquish the European bantamweight title to aim for bigger things.
''Bantam is a struggle,'' he said. ''Anyway that division has lost all
its sparkle, especially as I am not around. The money and prestige is at
super-bantam and a fight with Vasquez.''
Hamed recently watched Robinson retain the feather crown and wasn't
impressed. ''After Vasquez, I'll be going after Robinson. I know he
won't fight in Sheffield and that he wants to fight in Cardiff all the
time. Why can't we get it on at a neutral venue -- and for me that means
only one place, Glasgow.''
Hamed's trainer, Brendan Ingle, agrees. ''We could stage it open air
at one of the football grounds in Glasgow in July,'' he said. ''Robinson
has said he is bigger, stronger, older, and more experienced than Naz.
Well, let's find out.''
Hamed brushed aside claims by Ghana's WBO bantam champion Alfred
Kotey, who beat Scotland's Drew Docherty last week, that he is avoiding
him. ''I don't dodge anyone,'' said the Englishman. ''Kotey needs me
more than I need him, he needs the kind of money and television
audiences I generate. If he wants to step up to super bantam, I'll be
happy to knock him out.''

MANCHESTER United chief executive and chairman Martin Edwards last
night appealed to the Football Association not to extend Eric Cantona's
suspension beyond the end of this season.
The French striker, already banned for the rest of this term by his
club, appears before an FA disciplinary committee today over his clash
with a Crystal Palace supporter last month.
Edwards said: ''I hope the severity of punishment Manchester United
have imposed will be taken into consideration and, at best, they will
decide that is sufficient.''
His comments followed remarks by Cantona's French lawyer, Jean Jacques
Bertrand, that he feared the star -- charged by police with common
assault on Tuesday -- could receive a permanent worldwide ban from the
game.
Bertrand told the French sports daily, L'Equipe: ''He faces exclusion,
the extension of his ban to all federations. He could be banned from
playing for the rest of his life.
''My objective is to find a solution Eric will not resent.
''Everyone has seen the pictures and there's no denying reality, but
we'll try to remind the judges about the context. We won't try to
justify his actions, but explain them.''
However, Edwards said: ''I'd be disappointed if the FA banned him from
playing permanently in this country.''
United director and club solicitor Maurice Watkins will represent
Cantona before a three-man committee in St Albans. The panel will
comprise FA disciplinary committee chairman Geoff Thompson, Oldham
chairman Ian Stott, and Football League president Gordon McKeag. Even if
they decide on a life ban, it could be suspended.
Cantona will appear before magistrates in Croydon on March 23 over the
assault charge.

GEORGE Graham has been left in limbo -- sacked by Arsenal after having
received a #425,500 ''bung,'' but told by his accusers: ''We cannot say
you are guilty.''
The Premier League inquiry yesterday published details of the massive
Scandinavian-based payments, which ended Graham's eight-and-a-half-year
Highbury reign on Tuesday.
But they admitted they were powerless to act against the manager, and
have had to pass the buck to the FA.
They, in turn, have promised to study the dossier of evidence and are
expected to announce next week if Graham -- and maybe Arsenal -- will
face charges, which could result in a worldwide ban.
Ironically, Rune Hauge, the Norwegian agent whose ''gifts'' cost
Graham his reputation and livelihood, will remain free to operate in
English football.
Asked if the Premier League were not passing the buck, board chairman,
Sir John Quinton, admitted: ''Since we have no further powers, that's
possibly correct.''
The inquiry is not even recommending action: ''We will let the facts
be used by them (the FA) as they see fit,'' said the former banker, who
was making one of his rare public forays.
Graham angrily described the inquiry as a ''kangaroo court'' and the
circus that surrounded yesterday's announcement did little to improve
the authority's image.
But Rick Parry, the Premier League's chief executive, insisted: ''We
have emphasised that George has not been found guilty. The inquiry has
been thorough. It's been painstaking. We've amassed thousands of
documents. We've talked to a lot of different witnesses, and we put our
findings to George and gave him the opportunity to make a comment upon
them.
''One moment we're criticised for being too slow, the next for being
too quick. We believe we've been thorough, painstaking, and havedone the
job in a proper way.''
Although Graham must still await the official verdict on his actions,
Sir John Quinton added: ''If a Premier League club feels that any
employee has profited from a transfer in an improper manner, then the
Premier League would consider dismissal to be an appropriate sanction.
''The Premier League club chairmen this morning expressed unanimous
support for the action that Arsenal FC have taken. . .I don't think Mr
Graham would regard it as a whitewash.''
Parry added: ''There was a clear intention to separate the inquiry
process from the disciplinary process.''
But it remains an embarrassing fact that the Premier League's
constitution means they can dig the dirt, but have to wait for the FA to
act upon it -- and with Graham no longer employed in the game, there is
a doubt over what action the FA can take.
Graham Kelly, the FA's chief executive, described the case as ''an
extremely serious issue'' and said: ''As soon as the information is
received we will give it very serious and urgent consideration.''
He admitted there was nothing to stop another Premiership club from
offering Graham employment today, but discouraged them, saying: ''We
hope to be in a position to commence proceedings and we hope to be able
to require anybody concerned to come and answer the case before taking
up a position in football. We would want to deal with it first.''
If the case is proved against Graham, a ban is one of the options open
to the FA, and they can ask FIFA to extend it worldwide ''if we felt the
circumstances merited it.''
But Kelly admitted there seemed no action the FA could take against
Hauge, despite evidence that a company in which he had interest paid
Graham two huge amounts following the transfers of Pal Lydersen and John
Jensen.
''Mr Hauge is a licenced FIFA agent,'' said Kelly, adding: ''Certainly
the FA Premier League chairmen will be very cautious in the future.''
Kelly defended the way the inquiry had been conducted and backed moves
to revise the Premier League rule-book to prevent a future clash of
interests.
Managers' chief Howard Wilkinson of Leeds believes the league's
interim report into ''bungs'' prove that they are not rife in football.
The chairman of the League Managers' Association said last night: ''We
are as anxious as anybody to preserve and improve the good name of the
game. It is good to know that after one of the most thorough
investigations ever, there is no evidence that this sort of thing is
rife.''
Wilkinson promised that the LMA would back George Graham.
''It's terribly sad for George and we shall give him all the support
and help we can until the matter is finally resolved,'' he said.
''After all, we have not yet had an opportunity to hear his side of
the story. Until we do, we will make no further comment, particulary as
the whole matter could be the subject of an FA inquiry.''
Swindon chairman Ray Hardman, whose club were relegated in 1990
because of financial irregularities, was furious at the Premier League's
findings.
He said: ''Why were the FA not in on the inquiry in the first place?
It was a staggering display today by the Premier League.
''We had 15 seconds of comment and 15 minutes of waffle. They did not
lift the lid on anything. I am astounded.''

AS the commission of enquiry passed its interim findings, along with
the buck, to the FA, it became disturbingly clear yesterday that
football in England is about to open a sluice-gate of sleaze that will
match anything the politicians have managed to conjure up in recent
years.
They have named only one manager, the sacked George Graham from
Arsenal, as allegedly having accepted two ''bungs' in transfer deals,
but we can be absolutely certain that the man from Bargeddie is only
George the First.
The others are queuing up behind, quaking in their Gucci shoes, as the
inquiry proceeds. It is predicted that as many as eight other managers
could be highlighted by the time the investigation of the commission is
complete and certainly the chief executive of the Premiership, Rick
Parry, admitted that they are going through a list of Scandinavian
players who have been transferred to English clubs.
Graham, who claims to have paid back the money he received into the
Arsenal bank, seems equally certain to be punished further by the FA if
they find the allegations proven. Why the Premiership could not simply
have carried the inquiry to the next stage, a commission of discipline,
and dealt with the allegations themselves is far from clear but their
promise that the investigation will go on should ensure that other
officials who may have lined their pockets on the back of foreign deals
also will be brought to the front of the class.
It would be a grave injustice, not to mention disgrace, if the
Premiership decided to let the furore surrounding Graham's dismissal and
the reasons for it take centre stage and then quietly sweep the rest
under the floorboards.
The Arsenal manager, who was so good at his job that he proved himself
the best in the club's history, has been accused of sacrificing a great
career on the altar of greed.
Others, if the grapevine has it correct, have taken the Queen's
shilling or, maybe more accurately, the Norwegian Kroner, and when the
full tale is told the man in the stand will find it impossible to
comprehend the greed that motivates people with lifestyles that make his
own seem mundane.
Graham, it is said, was paid two separate sums by a Guernsey based
company, Inter-club, with whom Norwegian agent Rune Hauge was involved.
The commission found that he had been paid #425,000 in all, #140,000
during the deal for Pal Lydersen and #285,000 for the transfer of John
Jensen.
These are enormous sums of money, but maybe do not represent excessive
amounts to managers earning salaries upwards of #300,000 a year.
So far, the inquiry insists that its job has been merely to provide
the facts uncovered in their investigation but some of the gobbledygook
they released yesterday made our own football leaders sound like
clarions of clarity.
For instance, try this from Sir John Quinton: ''I would like to stress
that George Graham has not been charged and therefore cannot be labelled
as guilty of any offence. However, if a Premier League club feels that
any employee has profited from a transfer in an improper manner, the
Premier League would consider dismissal an appropriate sanction.'' If
''profiting from a transfer in an improper manner'' is not an offence,
perhaps he could tell us what is.
There is much sleaze to be released yet, but at least the Premiership
has put forward proposals which are designed to make transfer dealings
more in keeping with business practices outside the football world. It
has also highlighted the need for agents who wish to work in transfer
finances to be licensed, a move already instigated by FIFA.
In the meantime, who's next for the chop?

THE contractual dispute involving British featherweight champion
Michael Deveney and boxing managers Alex Morrison and Tommy Gilmour took
a new turn yesterday when Morrison, who has signed up the Paisley
fighter, said that he was ready to quit the sport if the British Boxing
Board of Control finds in favour of Gilmour.
Deveney won the vacant title last month when he outpointed Wilson
Docherty on a Gilmour promotion, but on discovering that he had signed a
promotional contract with Gilmour, agreeing to have his next three
fights for him, the new champion appointed Morrison as his manager and
that sparked off a legal wrangle.
The boxer claims he did not realise what he was signing, and Morrison
claims that the contract with Gilmour, which guarantees Deveney #5000
for his first defence, #7000 for his second, and #9000 for his third, is
invalid. Gilmour is equally adamant that he is in the right.
However, Morrison said yesterday: ''Michael will be boxing on March 4
on the Naseem Hamed bill at Livingston and will make his first defence
of the title against Jonjo Irwin, probably in Glasgow, on April 29.
''I have guaranteed him #10,000 for that fight, so there is no way he
is going to fight for someone else for #5000.
''But if the Board of Control back the options offered by Tommy
Gilmour, then I will hand back my licences.''
I understand, however, that, on legal advice, the BBBC will not be
prepared to accept the options on the contract held by Gilmour.

TO SOMEONE as slothful as me, it appeals as something close to the
ideal lifestyle. You train a bit during the week, nip on to the field
with about 15 minutes left, rap in a goal while the others are weary,
take a quick shower to sort out the hairstyle, and head for a Saturday
night out. Next day you read all about yourself in the tabloids . . .''
''Supersub Does It Again'' . . . you pick up the win bonus and prepare
for another hard quarter-of-an-hour the next week. Nice work if you can
get it, if you ask me.
There is also the prospect, based on the length of time you spend on
the park, of playing until you are about 67 or maybe even as long as
John Burridge.
Yup, if I come back let it be as a Supersub.
Yet, if you sound out the lads who have been so titled over the years,
they will wince at the memory. The inside perception is that once you
get that Supersub label, you are stricken for life and it seems there
are few footballers around who would relish the slothful way of life
which appeals to some of us on the sidelines.
Perhaps that is why two Motherwell players, Steve Kirk and Paul
McGrillen, are joining Falkirk this week to change the direction of
their careers.
Each has been considered in that dreaded category in his time at Fir
Park, with Kirk in particular having been stuck with the description for
many years. There was a spell when Kirk was scoring goals so regularly
from midfield that he looked likely to move to a bigger club but,
inevitably, it seems, he was returned to his deputy role. His remarkable
winning goal against Aberdeen at Pittodrie, which sent his side en route
to the cup final and ultimate success in 1991, was memorable but
reinforced his reputation as the substitute with the mostest.
Under Alex McLeish, Steve found the same pattern, invariably making
his entrance long after the rest had expended much of their energy. At
32, it may be too late to alter his image as one of the finest bench men
in the last decade, but he might well have enough good years in him to
please the Falkirk fans.
McGrillen, on the other hand, has plenty of time to re-establish his
place in the game. The 23-year-old striker who has played for the
Under-21 international side consistently, found himself vying for places
in the front two spots occupied by Tommy Coyne and Dougie Arnott, not to
mention another strong candidate, Alex Burns. His darting, penetrating
style was seen most times as a replacement for one or other of the
regulars, even if he did appear to have the knack of snatching goals in
his infrequent appearances.
He could be just the man to give Jim Jefferies, the Falkirk manager,
the finishing touch he believes has been missing.
Maybe the most famous Supersub was David Fairclough, of Liverpool who,
as memory lends, seemed to be forever popping on to the field for
Liverpool and scoring brilliant goals back in the seventies.
John Hewitt managed to score one of the most famous goals of
Aberdeen's history as a substitute in the Cup-winners' Cup final but
retained a reputaion as a fine player, rather than a magnificent
replacement. It can be done but it is not easy.
* AMID the great furore about whether the European Championships
should be held in England next year, it was fascinating to hear our
former SFA leader, Ernie Walker, defend the English game and
particularly stadiums with considerable passion. He was and is the most
patriotic of Scots and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to see our
lot dump the southern lot.
He could not, therefore, be accused of any pro-English stance and, as
chairman of the committee that goes around the globe examining fooball
grounds, when he says the English stadiums as a group are the best in
the world he must have a fair idea of what he is talking about.

LOVERS of big hitting were delighted when John Daly, by far the
longest hitter in world golf, took out his silver ''killer whale''
driver as he teed up at the 311-yard tenth hole in his first round in
the Nissan Open at historic Riviera yesterday.
Cheers turned to yells of delight as Daly cut his shot into the green
only 15-feet from the flag. He holed out for an eagle 2, and, although
he never quite matched that amazing start, his 67 put him in excellent
shape to try to win his first title of the year. Leading scores:
66 -- B Mayfair, J Mudd.
67 -- J Daly, B Faxon, C Pavin, C Stadler, L Wadkins, J Furyk, B Kamm.
68 -- J Carter, D Hammond, O Uresti, S Elkington (Australia), S Pate.
69 -- D Feherty (Northern Ireland), F Couples, H Irwin, P Jacobsen, J
Haas, D Love, J Leonard, M Wiebe, R Freeman, M Reid.

More optimistic times beckon at Dundee Rep, as Mary Brennan reports
THIS week Dundee Rep is mounting a Festival of Contemporary Dance..
It's a bright, attractive programme -- but there's something missing.
And that's an appearance by the Rep's own dance company, the company
which has, in recent years, been funded and promoted as Scotland's
leading professional contemporary dance group -- and that's more or less
the same as saying Scotland's only professional etc etc.
There's no appearance because there is no Dundee Rep Dance Company.
Last November, after months of well-masked tension and uncertainty,
there was a decisive parting of the ways. Tamara McLorg, artistic
director of DRDC since 1989, went south to take up a post as senior
lecturer in choreography at Middlesex University. She left feeling hurt,
angry, and even victimised -- though she chose not to make a public
tantrum out of a situation she saw as blisteringly unfair. The dancers
-- most of whom had been there for as long as Tammy -- followed her
example and moved on.
Hamish Glen, who is artistic director of Dundee Rep Theatre, was left
holding the recommendations of Bonnar Keenlyside -- the Scottish-based
consultancy who had been brought in to reassess the situation -- but
with no personnel to put any of them into effect. Not surprisingly,
no-one drew attention to any of this . . .
Things now, however, are looking brighter. When I spoke with Hamish he
had a pile of applications on his desk from parties interested in
rebuilding DRDC -- interviews for the post of artistic director will
probably take place on March 10. A new company of dancers will be
recruited and a major relaunch is envisaged in the spring of 1996.
All this is happening with the benefits of hindsight and increased
funding from the Scottish Arts Council.
What happened to Dundee Rep Dance Company is, in part, a reflection of
those expectations and pressures which all too often stymie pioneering
enterprises. In the beginning, as an energetic community based group
(imaginatively attached to the Rep), it produced popular, worthwhile
works on half-a-shoestring.
It was this particular facet of their output which brought a
prestigious Digital Dance Award in 1992. But as the company gained
profile, not just in Scotland but throughout the UK, there was an
incentive to include public performances alongside the workshops and
community projects. The next step was for DRDC to become established as
Scotland's full-time, professional contemporary dance company, the
leader in a field scattered with independent groups and solo performers
who showed work only occasionally and rarely toured.
Across the years the company battled hard to keep active on its
various fronts: it maintained links with community work, had specific
programmes for children, brought in outside choreographers -- like New
York's David Dorfman -- to sharpen the repertoire and broaden its
technical range. But still it was the same half-dozen dancers fulfilling
all these roles -- and frankly, the performance work started to suffer.
Glen admits to feeling exasperated at criticisms which repeatedly
homed in on the company's apparent lack of technical ability. ''These
same dancers have now found jobs with other companies, including
Rambert. So what does that say about their technique?'' He agrees,
however, that the real problem lay in trying to balance out the demands
of shifting roles -- a problem which should not bedevil the new Dundee
Rep Dance Company.
''For nine months of the year there's going to be a core company of
professional dancers -- maybe five in number but capable of being
augmented if necessary. We will hire in dancers/teachers for working on
the community projects such as the Dundee Summer Festival.'' This
niche-ing of tasks should, Hamish hopes, free up the artistic director
and the dancers to develop a strong performance profile for the group.
Obviously the Scottish Arts Council hopes so too. Funding has
increased, in encouraging anticipation. It had been #105,000 plus
#20,000 project funding. This has now gone up to #140,000 as from 1996
-- the current grant is #113,000 to take pro rata account of the company
being as yet unformed. Further project money will be sought when
performances and tours come on-stream.
These lessons have been learned the hard way. And -- depending on who
you talk to -- at the expense of McLorg and her team. Hamish Glen
chooses, of course, to look forward. He's conscious that the Rep is the
only theatre in town and so -- unlike the Citz or the Lyceum -- he sees
it as part of the venue's responsibility to programme in other strands.
Hence this week's showing of dance by Andy Howitt, Phoenix Dance, and
the Richard Alston Company -- and the promise that next year the Rep's
own company will be centre stage, setting the pace for contemporary
dance not just in Dundee but throughout Scotland.

DEREK Forsyth, the coach of the Scotland men's Under-21 side, will be
hoping for more of the same when they play Ireland in a three-match Test
series this weekend in Dublin.
At the start of their 1991 European campaign it was the Irish who
provided the opposition. Scotland then went on to qualify for the
European finals and also advanced to the finals of the World Cup for the
first time in their history.
The first port of call in the new European championship is a
qualifying tournament in Genoa in two months' time and Forsyth will be
hoping that the seeds for another successful venture into Europe will be
sown in Dublin.
He is able to call upon six of the squad, including three senior
internationalists, who participated in the World Cup two years ago.
The Irish, who always have a good junior side at their disposal,
include Grange's Andy McBride this time. They won the last series
between the sides 2-1 and will start favourites, but performances and
attitude are just as important as results to Forsyth at this stage.

THIS is an important year for Scotland's senior women's international
squad, who contest the finals of the European Nations Cup in Amsterdam
in June, hoping to improve upon fifth place four years ago.
They are pitched into international competition within a week of the
end of the indoor season and this weekend travel south for two matches
with England, the European champions, but coach Neil Menzies is not
worried about the lack of outdoor competition.
He is quick to point out: ''We took them on in similar circumstances
last season and beat them on both occasions.'' But he expects England to
be stronger, as they have a much larger squad in training, many of whom
were in the British squad which returned recently from San Diego.
There were six Scots on that trip but one of them, Diane Renilson,
fast emerging as one of the top defenders in Britain, has pulled out of
this weekend's venture with a broken finger in her right hand, sustained
in last weekend's European Indoor Club Championship. She will be
replaced by Alison Denholm of Western Klick Photopoint.
Captain Margery Coutts has retired after 96 caps, but the squad has a
good blend of experience and youth, including five players groomed last
season -- Denholm, Helen Walker, Susan Gilmour, Fiona MacInnes, and
Louise Burton.
Scotland have beaten England in their past three internationals and
there will be no lack of confidence in the squad.

THOSE in search of a live Champion Hurdle hope had their eyes opened
at Wincanton yesterday when Alderbrook clinched his first victory over
jumps with a stunning display.
A Group winner on the Flat with one outing in a novice hurdle more
than two years ago his only experience of National Hunt racing,
Alderbrook jumped really well when cruising to an eight-lengths win from
Trying Again.
The manner of his success had the bookmakers hastily rearranging the
Champion Hurdle market. Available at 50-1 before the race, Alderbrook
now is a best-priced 8-1 chance.
Few novices even line up in the big race and only Doorknocker, in
1956, and Royal Gait, in '92, have won the event as novices.
But Alderbrook, switched to Kim Bailey from Julie Cecil by owner Ernie
Pick to be trained for the Champion Hurdle only six weeks ago, has much
less experience and will go to Cheltenham without another run.
''I am not worried about his inexperience because I know he jumps
brilliantly,'' said Bailey.
''He is a very good horse who is being specifically trained for the
Champion Hurdle and I would have been disappointed to get beat.
''He's been electric in Lambourn. The three times he has schooled, I
have never seen a horse go so fast over hurdles in my life. He is very
fast, make no mistake.''

RUSSELL Kennedy, a Scotland under-18 cap last season, has been
delegated to take over from the injured Ian Jardine at centre for
Stirling County's crucial match against Boroughmuir tomorrow at
Bridgehaugh.
A Stirling win would keep them in front in the run-in to the national
league championship.
Jardine, whose right cheekbone was fractured during Scotland's 23-21
victory over France last Saturday, has been a key player in club and
country campaigns this season.
His stand-in, Kennedy, will be having his first league match of the
season, though the youngster does not lack experience at that level. He
had three championship matches for County last season, but it will still
be onerous for him to follow in such illustrious footsteps.
John Manson, Scotland's current reserve prop, has at last forced his
way back into the Dundee HS FP team.
It will be only his second league match of the season when he plays at
the Greenyards against Melrose, the defending champions, and even then
he will not be in his usual position at loose head as Dundee have
dropped his North and Midlands colleague, Danny Herrington, to let
Manson in at right prop. Tom Smith remains the favoured left prop.
Andy Macdonald, Heriot's international lock, returns to rugby to pick
up the pieces of a disrupted season by playing against Edinburgh
Academicals at Raeburn Place.
Because of severe leg bruising the 6ft 8in forward has had only five
senior matches this season, two for Heriot's and three for Edinburgh.
Academicals, who have yet to define their XV, have named a squad
including a new scrum half, Kevin Troup, who won a Middlesex sevens
medal as a wing with London Scottish in 1991.
* DUNCAN Hodge, who scored the dramatic drop goal for Scotland A to
beat the Springboks at Melrose last November, has been recalled to the
Scots' Under-21 side to face Wales at Inverleith a week today.
The Watsonians' stand-off replaces Bryan Easson, despite the
Boroughmuir man having kicked all of the Scots' points in the 35-12
defeat by the French in Paris last Friday.
West of Scotland hooker Gordon Bulloch also is recalled, after having
recovered from a broken nose.
However, his Burnbrae colleague Guy Perrett drops out of the second
row to make way for Hawick lock Ian Elliot. Barry Stewart returns to
tight-head prop, Cammy Murray of Hawick moves back to centre, while
Bath's Colin Morley appears on the wing. Team:
P W B Flockhart (Stewart's Melville FP); H R Gilmour (Heriot's FP), M
N McGrandles (Stirling County), C A Murray (Hawick), C Morley (Bath); D
W Hodge, E J W Weston (both Watsonians); M H McCluskie (Edinburgh
Academicals), G C Bulloch (West of Scotland), B D Stewart (Edinburgh
Academicals), I Elliot (Hawick), P T Jennings (Boroughmuir), T A McVie
(Edinburgh Academicals), D G Clark (Stewart's Melville FP), G F Dall
(Heriot's FP), captain.
Replacements -- I S Leighton (Melrose), B R Easson (Boroughmuir), A D
Featherstone (Morgan FP), S B Grimes (Edinburgh University), D R Massey
(Currie), L G A Graham , D G Cunningham (both Boroughmuir).

THE Scottish Badminton Union is to receive a special grant of #35,000
to be spent on preparing elite competitors for international events.
The money, from the Scottish Sports Council, confirmed yesterday, is
in addition to the sport's annual grant aid, and is the first evidence
of a change in council policy which in future will be to channel greater
resources to sports and competitors who demonstrate the ability to
succeed at international level.
The additional funds are particularly welcome with the world
championships due to be staged in Glasgow next year.
National director of coaching and development, Allan Campbell,
submitted a competitions' budget which, if granted in full, would have
required #154,000.
''This will mean we can send a few players to European tournaments,
and a couple of world grands prix,'' said Campbell. ''I am convinced
that some of our Scottish players are the equal of any in the world, and
that the sport has a great future here.''
That future has been enhanced by the fact that the SBU has now
acquired its own home. The Cockburn Centre, in Glasgow's Shieldhall,
which was previously rented, has now been bought over by the union.

OPEN champion Nick Price, who plays for Southern Africa versus
Australasia in the Southern Hemisphere's own Ryder Cup in Johannesburg
this weekend, is looking longingly at this summer's Scottish Open at
Carnoustie. The attraction is so strong, in fact, he is considering
incurring the wrath of US Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem and his policy
board, and an accompanying fine.
Price, restricted to a mere four releases a year from the inward
looking US Tour, wants to broaden both his own and the American's vision
of global golf by being able to play where and when he wants, and the
Scottish at Carnoustie, he said yesterday, was a definite possibility.
The Open champion is one of a growing of non-Americans who are beginning
to bristle at the constrictions of the US Tour.
''I even need a release to play for my country, Zimbabwe, in the
Alfred Dunhill Cup at St Andrews,'' said Price, who has already
committed to using up three of his four passes.
''I am considering Carnoustie although I might be heading for a fine,
but it would probably be worth it,'' said Price, whose team-mates at
Johannesburg's Houghton Golf Club include Ernie Els and Mark McNulty.''
Right now, however, Price's mind is on beating close friend Norman and
his squad in front of what he hopes will be 10,000 fiercely patriotric
home fans. Today's foursome pairings:
N Price (Zimbabwe) and M McNulty (Zimbabwe) v W Grady (Australia) and
L Parsons (Australia); E Els (S Africa) and T Johnstone (Zimbabwe) v R
Allenby (Australia) and M Clayton (Australia); R Goosen (S Africa) and D
Frost (S Africa) v G Norman (Australia) and M Campbell (New Zealand); H
Buhrmann (S Africa) and F Allem (S Africa) v V Singh (Fiji) and F Nobilo
(New Zealand).
First day foursomes pairings to be made after morning fourballs.

NEWCASTLE United are lining up a #1m-plus move for Aberdeen's Stephen
Wright.
Magpies' manager Kevin Keegan was at Easter Road this week and left
impressed after having seen Wright score Scotland's third goal in his
confident B international display against Northern Ireland.
Ambitious Keegan, who has #6m or so from the Andy Cole sale to invest,
is determined to build a team to dominate English football. Top of his
priorities is a right back and Wright's Pittodrie contract expires at
the end of the season.
Meanwhile, the Dons have three injured defenders -- captain Stewart
McKimmie, Brian Grant, and John Inglis -- all doubtful to face
Motherwell tomorrow.
* TWO Dundee United midfielders have injuries from Tuesday's 1-0 win
over Falkirk.
Jim McInally looks like missing tomorrow's game with fellow-strugglers
Partick Thistle at Tannadice after having been kicked in the face -- by
former United team-mate John Clark. Manager Ivan Golac admitted
yesterday: ''The eye has now closed and he is unable to see out of it.
On top of that, it could be dangerous to be involved in a game again so
soon.''
Billy McKinlay also could miss the Thistle clash. He was forced to
stop training yesterday when the foot he injured in the Falkirk game
started to trouble him again.
However, Scott Crabbe could be back, almost a year after he broke a
leg in a cup-tie at Motherwell.
United's Scottish Cup quarter-final with Hearts at Tynecastle on
Sunday, March 12, although live on BBC television, will be all-ticket.
United's 3500 tickets go on sale tomorrow morning to season-ticket
holders.
City neighbours Dundee could be set to lose French keeper Michel
Pageaud at the end of the season. The 28-year-old, who cost #70,000 a
year ago, has told manager Jim Duffy he is unhappy in Scotland.
* RANGERS fans should not be looking for a new name on the team list
in the near future, despite speculation that manager Walter Smith will
rush out to supplement his strike-force after the news that Mark Hateley
is out, effectively for the rest of the season.
Smith made it clear yesterday that he will move into the market only
if a long-term player were to become available.
The responsibility of leading the Ibrox line will now belong to Gordon
Durie, who could have Ian Durrant as a partner.

of second place in the World Amateur Team championship.
The Kilmarnock Barassie golfer was partnered by Irishman Padraig
Harrington, the Stackstown Walker Cup player, and his three-under-par 67
moved the two-man team to one shot behind leaders Australia. Leading
scores:
135 -- Australia. 136 -- Great Britain and Ireland, New Zealand. 138
-- Argentina.
* ENGLAND'S Warren Bennett shot a 69 to lie two behind leader Zoran

Zorkic, who was born in Yugoslavia, grew up in Australia and now is
based Houston, Texas.

Ross Finlay discusses the Aston Martin DB7 and its designer Ian Callum
who tonight receives an award in recognition of his work
THIS evening, Ian Callum from Dumfries will be presented with the
Association of Scottish Motoring Writers' annual Jim Clark Memorial
Award, in recognition of his work as designer of the Aston Martin DB7.
Even to somebody who has worked on projects on four continents, it must
have seemed like Christmas when the commission came to design the
bodywork and interior of the car intended to bring one of Britain's most
distinguished sporting makes to the forefront of attention again.
Aston Martin has had a roller-coaster career. One motoring historian
calculated that, between the wars, it would have been better off giving
every potential customer #150 to go and buy something else. And yet, it
built some fine cars and an acknowledged sporting pedigree. It was not
unreasonable that the BBC recently featured an Aston Martin as Bertie
Wooster's ''old two-seater''.
The finances improved post-war when David Brown took over. Some
splendid GT cars were produced, and Aston Martin became a real force in
sports-car racing, winning the world championship in 1959. There is a
strong Jim Clark connection here, because he raced a DBR1 for the Border
Reivers team.
Aston Martin became part of the Ford empire in 1990, with the
influential Walter Hayes in control. He commissioned the DB7, on a
Jaguar platform and with a body by Ian Callum's team at the
Oxfordshire-based TWR Design.
Some purists resent the fact that the DB7 comes with a supercharged
Jaguar 3.2-litre engine. But Jaguar is also owned by Ford, TWR -- run by
another expatriate Scot, Tom Walkinshaw -- had been building the XJ220
and could turn its attention to the DB7 project, and without that
Jaguar/TWR connection the DB7 would not have appeared at all.
When it was unveiled at Geneva in 1993, Ian Callum's creation was the
star of the show. He started with the advantage that, whereas many
modern high-performance cars are mid-engined designs with spoilers all
over the place, he was working with a ''cl assic'' front-engined
rear-drive layout.
The proportions of the DB7 are just right. The front-end treatment is
appealing, and the rear quarter -- often a difficult part of a design to
''balance'' properly -- was approved first time.
I drove a DB7 away from Aston Martin's headquarters at Newport Pagnell
and promptly stalled it a couple of times at traffic lights, but that
was only because I left the handbrake on! In its low-speed manners the
DB7 was irreproachable, which sets this #78,500 beauty apart from some
more exotic cars. Out on the open road, the DB7 romped away. With 335bhp
on tap, it will sprint to 60mph in under six seconds, and it shows how
superior in some ways the supercharger is to the turbocharger. When you
feed in the revs, the DB7 just seamlessly accelerates harder, and the
individual supercharger noise is impressive rather than distracting.
On a test track the DB7 will reach around 160mph. On a windy motorway
it felt stable and composed, which proves that, as well as drawing a
crafty line, Ian Callum knows his aerodynamics. There are some ultra
high-performance cars these days which cannot be ''left alone'' for a
moment. They need the reactions and attention of a racing driver. The
DB7 is nothing at all like that. And the luxurious interior which Ian
Callum designed is comfortable, well laid out, using the best materials
and a pleasure to occupy.
There is no doubt that the company made a mistake in releasing
pre-production cars for media road tests. Some bad publicity resulted.
But the genuine production cars are to customer standard. Bodyshells are
sent to Rolls-Royce for finishing, and the test car's Chiltern Green is
my favourite Aston Martin colour.
Ian Callum has managed to create a modern expression of the lines of
classic earlier cars like the DB2 and the DB4. There is an archive
photograph of Jim Clark hurling a DB4GT Zagato flat-out round Goodwood
in the 1961 Tourist Trophy race.  It is significant that the latest
Aston Martin body designer is not an Italian, but a fellow-Scot.

with pre-tax profits rebounding from losses of #215m to profits of
#1245m but the underlying picture gives a very different impression.
Current cost figures before exceptionals, which provide a more
accurate idea of what is going on, actually saw a fall from #649m to
#600m owing to the mild winter which depressed profits by #86m.
As a result, dividends are not increased above the 1993 level of
14.5p, and shares fell 5p to 299p. However, the outlook this year looks
brighter for profits and dividends.
The first benefits from the massive restructuring exercise which is
progressing ahead of schedule will start coming through and there will
be better returns from the developing gas exploration and production
activities. Savings in coming years are expected to top #600m a year and
are necessary if British Gas is to compete effectively.
Already competitors have 60% of the industrial and commercial market
which is open to competition, which represents about half the total
market. Next year liberalisation of the domestic market begins and it
will be fully open in 1998.
Erosion of domestic market share will not be so rapid given customer
inertia, though chief executive Cedric Brown drew attention yesterday to
the relative ease and low cost of entry into the domestic gas market.
This means there will be many competitors fighting for market share.
Employees in the main gas business were reduced from 66,577 to 55,630
through voluntary redundancy and natural wastage. This was more than
anticipated, which means the group will achieve its target of a 25,000
reduction by 1996. Other savings such as relinquishing expensive offices
in London are also being put in place.
British Gas admits that customer service has slipped a little in the
massive upheaval it is going through, though it trumpets the fact that
it met 36 out of 39 service standards set by Ofgas, the regulator. Mr
Brown said they were determined to improve service once the
restructuring was complete. He proudly explained that all engineers are
to be equipped with laptop computers.
Competitors should certainly help to keep the group up to the mark and
the it is pressing Government to ensure there is a level playing field
in the service and safety fields. The group needs to improve its
presentation skills given the hash it made of Mr Brown's salary
increase, which would have lost British Gas some market share had the
domestic monopoly not been in place.
The costs of the restructuring were provided for in 1993 so
exceptional costs for 1994 were only #105m against #1650m. But
provisions for cleaning up old gaswork sites have been increased by #90m
taking them to #248m.
The group is confident the figure will not rise much over this. It is
going through the sites steadily in descending order of severity of
contamination and has surveyed 60% of them. The portfolio contains some
valuable nuggets but they can only be sold or developed when they have
been decontaminated.
Past investments in exploration and production are bearing fruit and
by the end of 1994 the division was contributing 29% of operating
profits, against 18% for the whole of 1993.
There was the first full year of production from the Everest and
Lomand fields, while Morecambe Bay came on stream. This year will see
output starting from the Miskar field in Tunisia and a deal in
Kazakhstan is expected soon. The group is becoming an important gas
producer in its own right, with the profit stream from this business
continuing to rise. The target is to double production before the end of
the decade.
During the next five years, British Gas expects its capital spending
to total #9000m to #10bn and points out that it has to earn high profits
to support this.
British Gas will likely emerge from the big shake-up in the gas market
in good competitive shape. But there are uncertainties on the way and
the shares look a hold for the time being on a yield of 6%.

YESTERDAY was a busy old day for Motherwell manager Alex McLeish.
First of all he introduced Eddie May, his new signing from Falkirk --
Steve Kirk, Paul McGrillen and #100,000 in cash made the journey in the
opposite direction. He then revealed that one of his priorities was a
new striker before the transfer deadline at the end of next month -- and
finished by making a public apology to linesman, Martin Doran.
We all knew some 24 hours earlier, of course, about the dealings in
the transfer market. And it doesn't take a footballing genius to work
out that, having released goalscorers Kirk and McGrillen, a new striker
was at least a possibility.
But a manager apologising to a linesman? Now there's a thing. It came
just five days after Motherwell were knocked out of the Scottish Cup by
Hibernian at Easter Road, a match which was marred by crowd trouble and
shrouded in controversy surrounding the Edinburgh club's second goal.
At the time, Motherwell defender Brian Martin complained bitterly to
linesman Doran that Kevin Harper was offside when he set up the chance
for Pat McGinlay, and he was sent off by referee Hugh Dallas.
Said McLeish yesterday: ''Although at the time I didn't commit myself,
my players told me they thought offside should have been given. I had to
back the players and I took their word for it.
''I watched the incident again on television and I didn't need the
action replay to prove that the linesman was right and I was wrong. It
was a superb decision by him and I hold up my hands and publicly
apologise to him. Maybe this will learn me to keep my mouth shut.''
After that almost unique bout of honesty from a manager, you certainly
had to believe McLeish when he said that he had no intention of letting
the Old Firm get things all their own way, which is why May was brought
to Fir Park, and there is more money to be spent in the transfer market.
''Celtic have started strengthening their squad and they will get
better,'' he said. ''We don't want to get left behind.
''My main priority is to put as much pressure as possible on the sides
around us in the premier division, those who are our closest rivals for
a European place. I know people keep talking about how important it is
for the Old Firm to qualify for Europe, but it's just as important for
us, maybe more so.''
McLeish then talked about how he wanted to build his own side at Fir
Park and how tough an act his predecessor, Tommy McLean, was to follow.
He said: ''I admire the work Tommy did when he was here, and I admire
what he is now doing at Hearts. By comparison I suppose I am
inexperienced, but I'm confident I can do a job for Motherwell and I
have the right people round about me.
''I was on a hiding to nothing when I arrived. I know people were
saying I had inherited a team from Tommy. If I was a success, then it
was to be expected, and if I failed they would say I had mucked up
Tommy's team.
''I would like to think my assistant, Andy Watson, and I have maybe
got a bit more out of certain players and that when we deal in the
transfer market, we will bring in players who can only improve the
club.''
May, who will make his debut against Aberdeen at Pittodrie tomorrow,
admitted to being rather surprised that Falkirk agreed to let him go,
especially as he had 18 months of a contract to run and that only 10
days ago he had signed a year's extension to that contract.
Said the 27-year-old: ''The reason I have come to Motherwell is that I
believe they are one of the best clubs in Scotland -- a club that is
going places.''

FROM today at the Findlay Clark Garden Centre near Milngavie, you can
take advantage of the Mad March Sale.
In what way does this particular March sale compare with others of its
type? Well, you know what sales are usually like. They sound very
impressive at first, but when you get right down to it all that happens
is that a few goods which would only have cost you a few pennies in
non-sale times are now available for a few pennies less.
Not the Findlay Clark March Sale, though. Here it's not just the
cheaper items that are involved, it's the quality stuff too. A #140
Qualcast XR35 lawnmower, for example, can this weekend be yours for
#89.99. And a Europa Manor aluminium cold frame, yesterday on sale for
#62, is today on offer for just #39.95.
And what makes it all even more crazy is that there are lots and lots
of items which aren't actually part of the sale but are, just for the
fun of it, still priced lower than would otherwise have been the case.
Several items stand out in particular from the sale proper. Findlay
Clark have found that the most popular sale items of all tend to be
bark, peat and composts, so there are some heavy savings there, as there
are among the almost equally sought after fertilisers and chemicals.
In the tools and machinery section there are special offers on several
particularly high quality implements, including those cunning adjustable
tools which can be of equal benefit to people of different statures
doing different jobs.
Say, for example, that a person wishes to cut the top part off a hedge
with a pair of shears. If the person is a small and the hedge is large
and the shears are ordinary, non-telescopic shears, a problem arises. If
the shears are telescopic, on the other hand, they can simply be
extended and the job done easily.
Plant goods are available in the sale too, of course, and it doesn't
take much gumption to see that the packs of assorted foliage plants are
going to go down a storm. Although Findlay Clark have arranged these
selections for you in advance, there is nothing to prevent you asking
for an assortment of your choice.
Fuchsias tend to be the most popular choice here, but if you would
prefer your pack to be a fuchsia-free zone, then so be it.
There are various tempting offers in the gardening sundries section,
which like virtually every other department at Findlay Clark over the
past year or so has benefited from being given some extra breathing
space. In fact there is now twice the room there used to be, since this
section has taken over the area recently vacated by the Stirlingshire
Saddlery.
With spring just about creaking into action (though you can still get
hold of some attractive winter flowering heathers), it's time to start
thinking about bulbs and seeds. As if you hadn't already guessed,
Findlay Clark now have enormous stock s of each, including bulbs which
this summer will transform themsevles into technicolour lilies, begonias
and gladioli, plus seeds of every description from the houses of Sutton,
Unwins and Thomson &amp; Morgan.
For those who prefer a more culinary aspect to their garden there are
large potato packs including such splendidly named varieties as King
Edward, Arran Pilot and Golden Wonder.
At this point it's worth giving some thought, if you are not already a
member, to the ever-expanding Leafline club. A #10 membership fee brings
you into the fold for life, and means that on weekdays you can claim a
10% discount on all plant material , as well as receiving priority sales
information, free information sheets and a special Leafline newsletter.
There are also events and special offers that apply only to Leafline
members, so on your next visit it would certainly be worth your while to
pick up an application form.

THE Scottish Rugby Union are expecting a run on Murrayfield debenture
sales as a result of Scotland's 23-21 win in Paris on Saturday.
The SRU's head of finance, Graham Ireland, said yesterday: ''We
anticipated a good response. However, I'm delighted that inquiries are
100% up on last week and am confident that sales will be significantly
in excess of #31m by the time of the Welsh match next Saturday.
''Supporters know that one of the few ways to guarantee a ticket for
that match is to buy a debenture. That, and, of course, a successful
team is helping to increase sales.''
Scotland captain Gavin Hastings, who is part of the Carnegie Sports
International team involved in the sales, said: ''I'm pleased that
Scotland's success on the pitch is having such a beneficial effect off
it. Hopefully, this will continue.''
* LOTHIAN, who beat Glasgow last week, will be unchanged for the Bank
of Scotland Schools District Championship match against North at
Meadowmill, Prestonpans, on Monday (2.15). Team:
D Mallinson (Watson's); A Donaldson (Stewart's Melville), H Allan
(Watson's), G Ross (Heriot's), M Tweedie; B Townsend, D Ferguson; G
Hoyle (all Stewart's Melville), D Harley (Trinity), D Rutterford
(Watson's), E Emerson (Boroughmuir), A Barnes, D Aitken (both Stewart's
Melville), A Dall (Heriot's), N Taylor (Watson's). Replacements -- A
Green (Trinity Academy), D Pang, D Simpson (both Heriot's), J Megson, R
Simpson, F Connor (all Watson's), D Hourston (Stewart's Melville).

ALEX Marshall and Richard Corsie last night reached the final of the
Churchill Insurance World Indoor Pairs Championship at Preston Guild
Hall.
The Scots produced a fine display to send defending champions Cameron
Curtis and Ian Schuback tumbling to a 7-4, 7-2, 7-2 defeat.
''The first set was tight,'' said Corsie, ''and winning it was vital
-- it gave us a boost and we took command from that point.
''Alex and I are desperate to win this title. Scotland have not won it
before and if we do manage to win it, we'll be the first pair to hold
the world outdoor and indoor titles at the same time.''
And if the Scots maintain last night's form, they will be hard to beat
in tomorrow's final where they will play the winner of tonight's second
semi-final, an all-England clash between David Bryant and Tony Allcock
against Gary Smith and Andy Thomson.
However, there was disappointment for Scotland in yesterday's
outstanding singles quarter-final when Hugh Duff hit back from two sets
down to move 6-4 ahead in the deciding set Tony Allcock. But the
Englishman conjured up a grandstand finish to win 7-1, 7-3, 4-7, 3-7,
7-6.
Allcock now meets Thomson in today's opening semi-final after Thomson
beat New Zealand's Rowan Brassey 7-3, 3-7, 7-4, 7-5, while in today's
second singles semi-final, Corsie plays Norfolk's Mervyn King.

BRITISH football could be in for a bizarre transfer revolution if new
FIFA regulations are enforced in this country.
Under a rule introduced last year, a player is now permitted to
conclude a transfer deal with another club six months before his
contract with his current team expires.
It means that players could set up moves halfway through a season.
Until now, they have had to wait for their current contract to expire
before they could negotiate elsewhere.
Football seems to be heading for player-power in a big way, as the new
rule would allow players to talk to interested parties. The FIFA
regulation insists only that clubs write to the player's current team
informing them that they are ''interested'' in the player, once the
six-months period is reached.
There are a host of players currently beginning negotiations with
their clubs to set up new contracts from the end of this season but, if
the rule is applied, they could be free also to discuss openly with any
other interested teams and barter for their own futures.

Aside from the creation and playing of their music, funniness and Del
Amitri belong together.
David Belcher looks on the bright side of pop with Justin Currie
HIS perennial bonhomie under attack, Justin Currie finds himself once
more treading what he calls ''the promotional hamster-wheel.'' A fine
new Del Amitri album, Twisted, is nearing release by A &amp; M. Having just
spent three weeks buttering up the mainland European press by staging
gabfests and acoustic gig-ettes, Justin must now submit to the
telephonic attentions of such organs as the West Hartlepool Bugler and
Advertiser and the Osmondthorpe Bi-Weekly Courant. The process can
become arduous.
''I'd have been thrilled if my initial Del Amitri job description had
read: 'You will talk about yourself for eight hours a day for six weeks
per annum.' It's a position of privilege, being asked your opinion;
being given the chance to address the nation.
''And I hate bands who whinge about becoming commercial travellers,
selling a product for the record company. But being asked eight times a
day how the band started, and how to spell my name, and the band's names
. . . it can be gruelling. But do you know the worst thing about it?''
No. What?
''You'll get to the interview's end and hear a little voice over the
phone saying: 'Now then, Jason -- any funny stories?' ''
I carefully hide my notepad, with its incriminating final question,
from Jason's . . . sorry, Justin's gaze. But the problematic thing is
that, aside from the creation and playing of their music, funniness and
Del Amitri belong together.
Yet because Del Amitri are an innately witty, humorous, ironic bunch
who manifestly fail to take themselves with po-faced rock-star
seriousness, their work is often accorded less serious regard than it's
due.
Justin is aware of this. ''I take a pride in my work, but it's not
work with a capital W, like Van Gogh. I take a pride in gigs, in songs .
. . I'm as pleased as punch with the creation of some temporary jewel.
And I know that when the radio stops playing us, or the label drops us,
I'll continue making records and singing to people because my knees
always knock together with excitement when I've created something new.
''But a love of pop shouldn't distract you from being aware that, as a
pop singer, you're contributing to one of the shallowest areas of
culture. But I also know that some people who like our band would want
me to be more arrogant, and to behave more like a star . . . and I like
stars who act like that. I enjoy Noel Gallagher insisting: 'Oasis are
the world's No 1 songwriters.'
''But I'm not sure I'm worth it. I wouldn't be comfortable with it.
'Stop being silly!' I'd be saying to myself.''
Not that there's anything silly about Twisted, although its title was
partly inspired by a scene in the comic rockumentary Spinal Tap. Hear
Twisted, and you will be impelled to salute Del Amitri's ongoing prowess
in the classy, radio-friendly rock-pop stakes, and hail Justin Currie
for his grasp of all the arts of melodic songwriting . . . but hang on,
Justin's looking modestly pained again.
''Writer? Songwriter? Tunesmith's better. Writing pop songs is nothing
to do with writing -- it's bolting tunes together rather crudely. In
fact, the more crudely the better. You've a verse and chorus that go
together and then what gets called a middle-eight -- ie a funny bit that
shouldn't be there, and the more abrasive and out-of-place it sounds,
the cooler it is.
''Take the Boo Radleys' new single, Wake Up . . . it simply breaks
down part-way through, and that's the joy of pop, as opposed to the
fluid, melodic coherence of Cole Porter. And the difference between
writing and writing a pop tune is because a lot of pop tunes are just
four lines . . . one of the best pop songs ever is the La's There She
Goes -- four lines!
''I'm kind of offended to be called a writer, falling down drunk in
the gutter to be able to write The Lost Weekend. Maybe if you're a
novelist, you wander around looking at other peoples' lives for morsels
of inspiration . . . but people who write pop songs? I mean, the very
idea of being homeless and Phil Collins seeing you and popping back to
his mansion to write a compassionate song about you -- it's grounds for
justifiable homicide!''
Forswearing earnest analysis of his songs -- ''like dissecting a frog
. . . it dies under the scalpel'' -- Justin will allow that Twisted's
chief lyrical persona is ''deeply disturbed and distinctly
non-autobiographical. I've tried to get away from a horrible sixth-form
poetry confessional style.
''There's another change in approach in that our last album was the
first I wrote knowing that there would be an audience . . . that people
would definitely be listening. And so I got paranoid. 'What are people
going to expect?' This record was written for us, to our expectations
and no-one else's.
''We recorded it pretty quickly. In seven different studios, including
Jools Holland's, where we experienced our only real problem. You can't
record vocals there during the day because Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer
have a rehearsal room above the studio, and they spend their time
stomping about, pacing out routines and falling over laughing.''
Del Amitri: in their own unique and funny way, Scotland's most useful
pop artisans. And I'm not joking.
* Del Amitri will launch Twisted by playing live in Glasgow's Tower
Records at midnight on Sunday.

FINDLAY Clark do not stick rigidly to the subject of horticulture and
if your have any experience of the place you'll know that they do indeed
diversify quite strongly.
Among the major recipients of this policy are the local birds. If you
have a particular fondness for our feathered friends you can do a lot to
look after them with Findlay Clark's help. The birdcraft section has
massive stocks of peanuts, seed, feeders and birdhouses, including the
most amazing thatched affairs which, apart from a quite restrictive
opening, look as if they could allow a couple of ospreys to invite their
friends round for a rave.
Fashions have been changing noticeably over the past few years in the
world of garden furniture, the currently favoured base material being
cane -- particularly ideal for placing inside conservatories.
If it's gifts you are looking for, you're in the right place.
Amazingly colourful glassware jockeys for position with ceramics,
toiletries of every description, alarmingly calorie-intensive
confectionaries, savoury food items, candles of outstandingly varied
colour and smell, books on every subject-related gardening and quite a
few not, and mountains of greetings cards.
Floral art is represented, too, and quite a business it is, with
polyester silk flowers which from only a short distance away look
absolutely convincing. Dried flowers and grasses can also be found in
these parts, and if that's the sort of level of care you can afford to
expend you might fancy becoming the proud owner of an airplant, whose
maintenance instructions basically amount to putting the plant somewhere
and leaving it.
At the opposite end of the scale you might like to get involved in
bonsai gardening, where you can spend years teasing dwarf plants into
convoluted shapes in the manner of the Japanese experts.
All three of the Findlay Clark guests are still operating within the
main grounds, starting with Kew Conservatories who sell garden buildings
and all related goods from their own are just beside the main entrance.
The Stirlingshire Saddlery, recently displaced to a much larger area
within the centre, supply equestrian equipment of every imaginable sort,
including riding caps, brushes, saddles (of course) and many types of
outdoor clothing.
And it would never do to miss out a quick mention of, or even a more
leisurely visit to, the Famous Coffee House, which supplies everything
from a cuppa to a sumptuous high tea.

THE #816m Scottish Investment Trust suffered a 4.6% decline in net
asset value to 237.9p in the first quarter, resulting in a 16.8% fall in
the last 12 months.
Its performance during the three months to January compares with a
setback of only 3.4% for the UK and World indices.
The fully-diluted net asset value of 237.9p takes into account the
increase in the number of Ordinary shares from 256 million to 283
million since the quarter-end, with this exercising of warrants having
generated proceeds of #44.3m.
Edinburgh-based Scottish Investment expects to invest its substantial
cash balances in line with its current portfolio weightings during the
next six months.
At January 31, 47% of the fund was invested in the UK, with 11% in the
US, where the market rose 2.7% over the period. Continental European
investments accounted for 10%, with 8% in Japan, 6% elsewhere in the Far
East and 5% in emerging markets.
Gross investment income was up 20.6% on the first quarter of last year
at #7.9m. Although there was some underlying growth, some of the rise
resulted from special dividends and timing differences, and investors
were warned against assuming the figures would be respresentative of the
full year.
However, the independently managed trust believes prospects will
improve, anticipating that US interest rates will peak later this year.
Manager Ian McLeish said: ''Markets have been reacting to rising US
interest rates over the last 12 months and, once they peak out, our
expectation is that markets will recover.''
* IVORY &amp; Sime's flagship British Assets Trust yesterday announced a
first quarterly dividend of 1.095p, representing 25% of the total payout
in its last financial year.
The dividend is in line with proposals in a circular to shareholders
in November on the trust's highly-publicised capital reorganisation
which was ultimately approved by members in December.
This created two classes of shares, growth and income, after the #732m
Edinburgh-based fund failed to cover dividends with earnings in its last
three years.

SWEDEN'S Robert Karlsson shot a course-record 64 yesterday to take the
first-round lead in the Open Mediterrania in Valencia.
He had nine birdies in his round, with only one bogey, and hit his
iron shots so close to the pin that he sank only two putts of more than
15 feet.
Britain's Ross McFarlane and Andrew Sherborne, meanwhile, were among
the early pace-setters.
McFarlane -- Manchester-born but now based in Stoke Poges -- fired a
seven-under-par round of 65 and lies one shot behind.
In contrast to Karlsson, McFarlane sank one putt of 20 feet, two of 25
feet, another of 30 feet and a 45-foot monster at the 410-yard fourth
hole.
''I'm not a very consistent putter,'' admitted McFarlane later. ''But
I'm a streaky putter and, when I'm on, the holes look as big as buckets.
That's how it was today and I just felt I couldn't miss.''
Sherborne, who hit 66, should have been very happy with eight birdies
on his card but said: ''It could have been better because my driving was
very bad over the last seven holes.''
Sweden's Freddie Lindgren finished level with Sherborne, a welcome
start after a poor opening to his season.
''I finished well back in Dubai, missed the cut in Madeira and retired
in Gran Canaria because of the flu,'' said Lindgren. ''I've just stopped
taking penicillin and today I played really well.''
Spanish Ryder Cup player Jose Maria Canizares is lying fifth on 67,
with six players -- Sam Torrance, Lee Westwood, Peter Baker, Mark Roe,
new Swedish star Jarmo Sandelin and Argentina's Vicente Fernandez -- on
68.
Torrance, Roe, and Baker are all chasing European Ryder Cup places,
and all three intend to play a full schedule in the hope of collecting
valuable points.
But another Ryder Cup hopeful, Sandy Lyle, who has been out of action
for 14 weeks, did not start well. He shot a one over par 73 and will
need a much better round today if he is to make the half-way cut.
Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
64 -- R Karlsson (Sweden)
65 -- R McFarlane.
66 -- F Lindgren (Sweden), A Sherborne.
67 -- J-M Canizares (Spain).
68 -- V Fernandez (Argentina), S Torrance, M Roe, L Westwood, P Baker,

Riley (Australia), A Forsbrand (Sweden), P Curry, R Boxall, D Williams,
G Brand Jr, D Gilford, P Broadhurst, M Mackenzie.

Watson, M Miller, L Lozano (Spain), M Litton, G Emerson, D Clarke, R
Alvarez (Argentina), D Westermark (Sweden), J Haeggman (Sweden), H

Jonzon (Sweden), M Pinero (Spain), S Struver (Germany), M McLean, E
O'Connell, M Hallberg (Sweden).
Other scores included: 72 -- C Ronald. 73 -- S Lyle, S McAllister. 74
-- A Coltart, G Orr, A Hunter. 75 -- C Cassells, A Oldcorn.
* JIM McAlister, the professional at Haggs Castle Golf Club, shot a
second-round 74 for a two-round aggregate of 146 to be joint fourth,
three shots off the pace at the PGA European Seniors Tour Qualifying
School in Spain.
Spaniard Francisco Abreu, winner of the 1976 Madrid Open, shot a
second-round 69 to join America's Deray Simon in a tie for the lead.
Today's final round will determine which players gain exemption to the
PGA European Seniors Tour this season.  Leading totals (British and
Irish unless stated):
143 -- F Abreu (Spain) 74, 69; D Simon (USA) 71, 72.
145 -- W Sauer (USA) 74, 71.
146 -- H Fraser (USA) 77, 69; J McAlister 72, 74.
147 -- B Browne 74, 73; H Inggs (S Africa) 75, 72.
150 -- T Coveney 76, 74; F Rennie 77, 73.
151 -- M Alvarez (Spain) 73, 78; M Hoyle 73, 78.

A CONUNDRUM for our times: how do you match people who want jobs with
the jobs that people don't want? Everywhere you go these days you hear
dreams of early retirement.
We are told that white-collar workers, across the spectrum from humble
clerk to majestic MD, are suffering record levels of work-related
stress; although let's make it clear we're talking post-industrial,
late-twentieth century, Western-workplace pressure, and not the
crippling physical stress of Rajasthani construction sites where women
labourers heft hods of bricks on their heads.
None the less, as an apocalyptic heading in the Times put it the other
day, ''Death stalks the office corridors''. The British workforce has
longer hours than any in Europe and many in Japan, and those horrible
euphemisms of the consultant managers, ''downsizing'', ''outplacing''
and ''rationalisation'', have put too many people out of work and left
too many people in work whose demands ruin their health and wreck their
domestic lives.
Which of us has the boldness to will ourselves out of an oppressive
job, unless protected by golden handshakes and gilt-edged pensions? The
day of the middle-aged drop-out, the middle-management beach bum may be
closer than you think.
The other evening, mistiming a visit to the local ''swimcentre'' (as
we must now call the baths) I found myself stuck in the sauna with the
sweating lard of three or four men. Despite the absence of suits, it
soon became clear from their conversation that they belonged to the B
and P class. I eavesdropped on their girns, their rueful fantasies of
liberation from the executive yoke.
''There's a little summer job I've got my eye on,'' said one. ''The
putting green attendant at Helensburgh. You have a wee hut when it
rains, and a gas ring to make tea, and when the sun's shining you sit on
a bench and get all the chat from the passing wifies. And you also get
to shout at the kids when they try to sneak a second round.''
The sauna fairly steamed with fellow feeling. I'm no captain of
industry, or even a foot soldier in the corporate workplace, but the
dread of the deadline is its own neurosis and, as we casual employees of
the increasingly deregulated newspaper market say, you're only as good
as your last piece. As I glowed among the perspiring gents I had my own
hallucination . . .
It is early morning on the edge of the Mediterranean, I'm standing
beside the swimming pool of a luxury hotel and I'm frowning at some
blossoms of bougainvillea floating on the water. Slowly I reach behind
me for my long-handled net and with dreamy strokes fish the untidy
flowers from the pool.
With infinite languor I then pull the cushions from their poolside
lock-up and arrange them on the sunbeds, while my apprentice sweeps and
hoses the tiles. I stay on duty to dispense the beach towels, but
otherwise my morning's work is done.
Or I'm in the West Highlands, sitting at the gateway of some pretty
ruin managed by Scottish Heritage and neglected by all but the most
dutiful tourists. I'm well equipped with books, radio, binoculars and
perhaps a notepad for a little gentle, deadline-free scribbling, and
between spring and autumn I watch the seasons change on the loch and the
hill. I try not to look too grumpy when the occasional visitor requests
an entrance ticket and a souvenir guide book.
The unemployed want work; the employed want shot of it or, the next
best thing, they want some kind of minimalist job which will supplement
their pensions and investments but release the energy to stand and
stare, not full of care. And within this contradiction there's another
which puzzles me: if, as we are also told, going to the shops is
Britain's No 1 leisure activity, who are all the people who are doing
it?
One section of the population doesn't have the money to shop for
leisure, and another has the money but doesn't have the leisure to shop.
Yet the malls and out-of-town complexes are thronged. Shopping centres
have become tourist attractions, destinations for coach outings.
Last year 26.8 million people visited Gateshead's MetroCentre, and
it's fair to assume most of them bought something. Were they all
putting-green attendants or part-time ticket collectors in the heritage
industry? Surely not.
Much has been said about the magnetic phenomenon of the megastore and
the mall. To the introvert they are secular cathedrals, to the extrovert
the new marketplace, but whatever you call them I think they all suffer
from sick-building syndrome. I've never been in one yet which hasn't
made me thankful to get out before I started hyperventilating on
artifical air, indecision and sensory overload.
The traditional department store has much the same effect (the fog of
perfume, the glut of choice) yet I'm as much a consumer as anyone. It
takes real willpower, when another unsolicited catalogue drops through
the letterbox, to persuade myself I don't really need a sonic pest
repeller or a therapeutic steering-wheel cover which massages
acupressure points on my hands while I drive.
But I would rather dig drains in the open air than entertain myself in
the ''protected environment'' of a shopping centre; and I speak as one
who has fled swooningly from the mummy of all malls, which in its own
way is a stroke of civic genius and entrepreneurial vision.
How do you put the oil town of Edmonton, an industrial capital with
the cruel winter climate of the Alberta prairies, on the tourist map?
You give it 800 covered shops, 110 ''foodpoints'' and the largest indoor
carnival and water park in the world. More Canadians now take package
tours to West Edmonton Mall than they do to Niagara Falls.
In the sixties we were all told to prepare ourselves for more leisure.
The first purpose-built leisure centres made their appearance. Yet those
who have jobs are working harder than ever, and maybe that's why so many
of them dedicate their meagre rations of spare time to the shops.
Perhaps a regular session of retail therapy is the only therapy which
helps corporate man and woman to rationalise an awareness that they have
been turned into wage slaves.

DISCUSSIONS are underway about a sex change for one of Scotland's most
venerable institutions. To mark International Women's Day next month,
the Scotsman, a newspaper which circulates in the East Coast of
Scotland, is considering renaming itself the Scotswoman. The paper would
be edited on the day by wimmin on the staff, with the chaps presumably
relegated to making the tea and doing some light dusting around the
office.
The formidable and talented Lesley Riddoch, the Scotsman news supremo,
is an obvious candidate to take the helm with her experience on the
magazine Harpies and Quines. There is one small fly in the ointment.
Some women on the staff have demurred. The word tokenism has been used
to describe the exercise.
The answer, surely, is to change the name permanently to the
Scotsperson.
History lesson
SPOTTED, by Alex Jackson of Muirend, in the Financial Times the
following apology:
''The archive photograph which we published on February 11 as 'Dresden
in ruins' was in fact of San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake.'' As
Mr Jackson points out, it's a good thing the RAF did not make the same
mistake.
Sparks fly
PAISLEY podiatrist (that's chiropodist to us) J M Irvine writes to
pass on a tip from one of his patients for how to put a permanent end to
circulatory problems. Said patient was extolling the virtues of a new
dressing which had dramatically improved the condition of the venous
ulcer on her leg. Pressed as to the name of this wonder dressing, she
said: ''I think it was called Semtex''.
Called to account
WE have to report an outbreak of honesty and even humour on the part
of the accountancy profession. The current edition of Impecunias, the
trade mag for insolvency practitioners, contains a surprisingly
self-deprecating guide to the revised definitions of insolvency terms as
might be contained in a Bill to be placed before a Scottish Parliament.
Among the definitions:
Insolvency.
* Condition arising from a company being skint or bust, sometimes
accompanied by a director having done a runner.
Insolvency Practitioner.
* Person authorised (God knows how) to act in insolvency proceedings.
Appears under various guises, and charges extortionate fees for all
types of insolvency procedures.
Receiver.
* Insolvency Practitioner acting in a receivership (surprise,
surprise). Exceedingly expensive, and fixes fees by simple method of
leaving no money for creditors.
Members Voluntary Liquidation.
* Boring liquidation of solvent company. No fraud, moonlighting,
phoenix companies, hardship or aggravation -- not even much hassle over
insolvency practitioner's fees.
Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation.
* Stupid name as there is nothing particularly voluntary about it.
Does avoid need to go to court, where certain directors already have
season ticket. Second cheapest form of liquidation.
Creditors' Meetings.
* Called under differing sections of the Insolvency Act 1986 for
differing insolvency procedures. Real purpose is to let creditors have a
go at directors, as they are entitled to some fun on the grounds that
their debts are worthless.
Irreverent
THE write to reply is deeply embedded in the Diary's philosophy and
thus we reproduce the following letter from Mr James Steele of Troon:
''I take issue at your frivolous, pathetic, and totally irreverent
attitude displayed by trying to find something funny to say about Sir
Nicholas Fairbairn, especially on the day the poor man is being buried.
''His political persuasions may not have been everyone's cup of tea,
but he was more of a man than you will ever be.
''You are both a political and religious bigot. Your articles are not
funny, and invariably are the crud scrapings from the bottom of the
barrel, wherever you find them.
''I will be writing to your editor to demand your dismissal, and will
raise the matter with my MP.
''Your irrevocable public apology is the least that is expected, but
probably beyond the limit of the void in your skull.''
Round the bend
MALCOLM McLeod of the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery at Glasgow
Yoonie writes to take us to task on the subject of crescents. We mocked
estate agents Slater Hogg and Howison for describing a house as being
located in a ''curved crescent''. But there are such things as straight
crescents, he points out. Look no further than Marks and Sparks have
started selling packs of straight croissants.
Different class
SCHOOLKIDS. Don't you just hate them. Especially when they pollute the
train on your way home. Liz McDowell of Roddinghead Road, Glasgow,
reports a refinement of this misery. ''One of the school children, 12
years old if a day, brings out a mobile phone and dials. He wants a taxi
to meet him at the station to take him to an address near mine. He gets
it. I walk home, pondering lifestyles.''

SMITHKLINE Beecham is well placed to prosper in the more challenging
healthcare environment of the 1990s following a spate of acquisitions
last year. These included DPS, a US pharmacy benefit manager, and
Sterling Healthcare's over-the-counter medicines business.
The company is firmly focused on human healthcare and pharmaceutical
healthcare. It has a good product portfolio both in the prescription
market, and almost as important these days, in the over-the-counter
(OTC) medicine market.
The company exceeded City forecasts with pre-tax profits growth of 9%
to #1271m. A figure close to #1340m is expected for the current year.
Continued strong sales growth in some of the newer products coupled
with expansion of the OTC market and synergies from restructuring will
boost profitability in the years ahead. A one-off provision of #580m has
been made to cover restructuring of the group's supply chain over the
next three years.
Last year, the group's sales rose by 8% to just above #6000m with
acquisitions, in the second half, contributing 3% of the sales growth.
Chief executive Jan Leschly, said it was ''a very succesful year for SB
in financial and strategic terms''.
Sales of new drugs are more than offsetting the decline in the sales
of anti-ulcer treatment Tagamet since it came off patent in the US in
May. Tagamet sales have declined by $220m (#138m) in the US alone,
replaced by cheaper generic competition.
Since 1990, total new product sales of drugs such as the
anti-depressant Seroxat and the arthritis drug Relafen, has risen from
#17m to #811m with further strong future growth potential. The main
impact of Tagamet's patent expiry is expected to come through in
mid-1995.
The research and development of innovative products is crucial these
days if healthcare companies are to try to resist downward pressure on
their margins. SmithKline increased its R&amp;D spend last year by almost
10% to #621m.
The company is well placed both internally and through its links with
external programmes, in areas such as biotechnology, to discover
potentially lucrative new chemical compounds.
The group's shopping spree last year inevitably put a strain on the
balance sheet with gearing at the year-end of 206%.
The sale of its animal health business for #927m will reduce gearing
to 99% but little further improvement is expected in 1995. However, no
more large acquisitions are envisaged within the next two years.
Interest cover was 24 times last year and is expected to drop to a still
healthy 10% in 1995.
SmithKline is high on the list of brokers' share recommendations
despite the fact that the stock outperformed its major UK pharmaceutical
rivals last year. Yesterday, the shares jumped 18p to 497p.

IWAS supposed to be debating the future of work at Gleneagles this
week, like everyone else at the Scottish Council Forum. Instead I've
been juggling acres and fathoms, yards and ounces -- not to mention the
odd dram and rood -- as I struggled to make sense of the United
Kingdom's last few heroic steps into an entirely metric future.
Before heading for Perthshire, I received an unsolicited copy of a
Department of Trade and Industry circular in the proverbial brown
envelope. It was prosaically headed Units of Measurement Directive:
Government Use of the Metric System and dated November 21, 1994. I
stifled a yawn.
There had been some minor public flurries on the issue at the end of
the year, as the gill, the accustomed spirit measure of whisky drinkers,
gave way to multiples of the centilitre in pubs across the UK. The odd
murmur of discontent among their Lordships had been recorded in the
public prints earlier in November as statutory instruments amending
weights and measures made it a criminal offence, from next October, to
use imperial units as the primary measure of quantity in trade.
That old retail joke -- I'd like five metres of that material, how
much is it? It's 2/11d a yard -- looked like being consigned to the
imperial scrapheap. Was this worthy wad of DTI paper more of the same? I
stifled a second yawn. But, when I read on, I began to realise that this
contribution to the metrication debate was of more seismic proportions.
It reveals the DTI and the Government as a whole in a complete
red-faced fankle over the final implementation of a Brussels directive
first promulgated in 1989. That directive required member states to use
the metric system of measurement and to stop using imperial alternatives
for ''economic, public health, public safety and administrative
purposes''. Its aim was to remove a perceived technical barrier to trade
in the emerging single market.
That was the technocratic rationale. But, to those of a Euro-sceptic
cast of mind in Britain, such assaults on the remaining benchmarks of an
imperial era are at one with all other Brussels nonsense, straightened
cucumbers, endangered black puddings, and other assorted Delors horrors.
However, a directive is a directive. Apart from a few exemptions, a
metric system of measurement had to replace the imperial measures by
January 1 this year. The commission's only other concession is that
imperial units can continue to be used as a ''supplementary indication''
of quantity. In other words, they can go in brackets.
But from now on, writing a contract, specifying a tender, or drafting
legislation to include feet and pounds rather than metres and
kilogrammes as the main measures risks falling foul of the law. One can
only imagine the looks on Ministers faces. This was tantamount to
proposing a final public execution for the foot and the pound, the inch
and the ounce. Teddy Taylor and his pals would be up in arms. Given the
absence of an overall majority thanks to an earlier Euro brawl, that
trip to the Palace to ask Her Majesty for a dissolution might be looming
sooner than anyone thought.
So there has been no public announcement. Instead, the DTI circulated
every Government department and a host of other Whitehall agencies
ranging from the Office of the National Lottery to the Ordnance Survey,
with a stark warning: ''This means that legal and official recognition
should be given to the metric system and that no such recognition should
be given to the imperial system except where transitional arrangements
or exemptions apply.''
All departments are urged to metricate everything they do from
January. They are further urged to ''trawl'' all existing legislation to
identify all references to imperial measures and propose amendments,
starting with those items carrying the ''highest legal risk''.
Despite ongoing legal debate within Government about the full impact
of the directive, the DTI warning is clear: ''Contracts based on
specifications containing measurements in imperial units may be
unenforceable; and planning consents or any form of prohibition
containing measurements expressed in imperial units may be void.
Departments are therefore advised to ensure that all official documents
which they or public bodies for which they are responsible send out
after 1 January, 1995 are metricated.''
The document goes on to admit that the same rules may well apply to
contracts between private companies and between the private sector and
local authorities. And yet there appears to have been no attempt to
alert that outside world to the dangers they may be negotiating their
way into. Why?
I can only assume that Ministers are more concerned to keep the lid on
the simmering Euro rebellion on their own back benches than to alert the
rest of Britain to the fact that we are now, legally at least, in a
metric world, that, with few exceptions, yards and inches are now part
of the past.
How absurdly typical all this subterfuge is of a country which has
dragged its feet on metrication for more than 100 years. Now that we
have finally reached the metric threshold, Ministers are too busy
assessing the electoral arithmetic and pulling the wool over the eyes of
their own Euro rebels, to show a bit of straightforward commercial
leadership.
Now that the story is public, what next? Will Friends of the Foot and
Pals of the Pound groups spring up across the land to fight last-ditch
battles? Or will the inch and the ounce go the way of the hundredweight
and the stone? One thing is certain. Our friends in Europe will see this
saga as yet another example of the pusillanimous way in which our
leaders view their attachment to the rest of the continent.

RECENTLY I contacted the Cardiff tax office on behalf of an elderly
relative who should have been given the age-related tax allowance worth
around #4 per week.
While I succeeded in obtaining the alteration to the coding, my
inquiries revealed that it was standard procedure to deny the elderly
the full personal tax allowance decreed by Parliament until either the
senior citizen objected to the coding or the tax office discovered at a
later date an overpayment.
The spokesperson for the Cardiff office stated that overpayments of
tax were better than underpayments.
Does the Inland Revenue apply this principle nationally or only in
Cardiff?

OUR primary 6/7 class was totally appalled at the letter from Mr John
Liddell (February 14).
At present our environmental studies are about the whale, and we feel
that the whale should be allowed to swim in the River Clyde without
anyone endangering its life.
We are quite sure that Mr Liddell will survive without his whale
steak. We only wish that we had been eye-witnesses to the frolicking of
this gigantic sea mammal.
After all, the whale entertained its audience for five hours and we
are sure that more pleasure would be gained from watching this
marvellous sea creature than eating it.
We would like to invite Mr Liddell to St Vincent's to look for himself
at the work done by P6/7.

I TAKE offence at Mr John Liddell's letter (Whale of a feast, February
14).
As he states, our fishermen are constrained by the laws. Is he able to
supply the necessary licence to catch whales?
I suggest Mr Liddell looks more deeply into the life and work of our
fishermen before berating them so scathingly.
I would be happy to supply details of an average week's work at this
time of year but, if he would prefer, it could easily be arranged for
him to spend a week on board and sample the life first hand.

BEARING Fruit, a collection of five shorts plays by women and a
Portrait of a Woman, French playwright Michel Vinaver's dramatic
reconstruction of a 1950s cause celebre about a young woman tried for
killing her lover, offer constrastingly different aspects of women's
lives.
Vinaver's short, sharp, overlapping scenes successfuly evoke the
battle of a young woman tried as much for her sexuality as the actual
crime, but remains at a slight emotional distance because of its
formalistic style. Bearing Fruit, on the other hand offered a rather
different challenge -- distinctly uncomfortable images of women as
monstrous incarnations of possessiveness.
Variable both in tone and quality, the concentration on the subject of
motherhood apparently surprised some. But all were united by a
continuing though hardly new insight that marriage and the nuclear
family should be marked: ''This could seriously damage your health.''
More curious perhaps was the virulent self-criticism implied in
Meredith Oakes's Mind the Gap -- a lethal, if almost wholly one-sided
satire about a middle-class mum's irrationality in comparison with her
teenage son. As he is the one regarded as in need of psychotherapy the
cautionary message behind this one would seem to be, ''look to the
mother,'' as would the idea behind Helen Edmundson's Coventry Carol in
which an obsessively religious mother murders to make sure her daughter
plays Mary in the school nativity play.
Levinia Murray's Passing Off, about a transvestite father's ''coming
out'' on his daughter's wedding day, went for cheap laughs before ending
on a more thoughtful note, but in the end what it and the other two
plays -- Sara Sugarman's poetic and moving monologue, An Epic Ouch and
Hanan Al-Shaykh's Dark Afternoon Tea -- depressingly point up is how
little has changed in women's lives.

THE resignation of Chris Green and the ramifications for railways in
Scotland could not have been better described than in your leader
(February 18). By telling the truth he was considered expendable.
Fortunately, Mr Green was able to make good his landing into an area
that could allow him an early return to combat at a later date. One at
least lives in hope that Brian Wilson, the Labour spokesman, will, as
suggested, find a role for him if and when a different administration
gets hold of the remnants of our rail system.
In fairness, Mr Lang should not escape without comment. For the
Scottish Secretary of State to lose someone of Mr Green's stature in the
midst of the privatisation battle must be equal to Nelson rowing away
before Trafalgar or Montgomery being given indefinite leave on the eve
of Alamein.

WITH respect to the Rev Robert Penney, whose letter I would generally
agree with, I would suggest that the primary task of the church -- while
including the promotion of ''sound biblical morality and spirituality''
-- is rather to proclaim the good news of salvation won for us, not by
our own efforts, but by the atoning act of Christ's death on the cross
(February 16).
The term ''salvation'' here means the reconciliation of fallen mankind
with God; it acknowledges a sinfulness on our part which, ordinarily,
would result in our separation from God, the source of all life.
Recognition of such a wonderful and precious truth necessarily
involves an act of faith in which our response is reflected in our
subsequent conduct. Biblical morality and spirituality is normally the
result.

IT is with shock and sadness that I learn of the departure of Mr Chris
Green from ScotRail. His loss is a great blow to the future of rail
transport in Scotland.
I clearly recall the mood of optimism when he ran the original
ScotRail in the mid-eighties, when services (then still all provided by
real trains) were second to none.
His move to Network South-east revitalised the moribund Southern
Region of BR, and was seen by many at the time as a step on the path to
the chair of the British Railways board.
John Major's Government of national stupidity is directly responsible
for the current state of decay in our railways, which has forced such a
talented and capable man as Mr Green to leave the industry he loved and
seek employment elsewhere.
I have no doubt that under his direction English Heritage will grow
and flourish. Ironically it will probably be the eventual custodian of
the ruins of England's rural railways.
The spirit of Dr Beeching is alive and well in central Government.

SHELL sees oil staying in its present trading range of $14 to $20 a
barrel for some years to come with the market structurally over-supplied
unless there are disruptions.
So the Royal Dutch Shell oil giant, now the world's most profitable
company, is continuing its attack on costs which includes a major review
of its head offices in the Hague, London and Wilmington in the US
altogether employing 8000 people and costing over #600m a year.
John Jennings, chairman of the Shell British arm, said that the review
should be broadly agreed by the end of next month but would take several
months to implement.
He was speaking after Shell announced a 36% rise in net income for
last year to #4070m thanks mainly to a major turnaround in chemicals. On
a current cost or replacement basis, the profits advance was 24% to
#3995m because of a particularly strong fourth quarter fuelled by
exceptional items.
However, the market took its cue from the underlying 5% improvement
after deducting the #502m of exceptionals and the gloomy oil price
prognosis rather than the sharp increase in the dividend total. That
jumped 12.9% to 27.1p with a 15.9p final -- the increase reflects the
desire to reduce the impact of the weaker pound against the Dutch
guilder with the Royal Dutch dividend total just 2.9% greater at
Dfl8.85.
Shell shares ended 4p cheaper at 720p where they yield 4.7%.
Brent crude averaged $15.80 a barrel after a particularly weak first
quarter at $14 compared with 1993's $17. It is now fluctuating around
$16.45 and Mr Jennings says that this seems likely to prevail in 1995 as
non-Opec production is continuing to rise while Opec has extended its
production agreement for the whole of the year.
Oil exploration and production profits fell 16% to #1511m, excluding
exceptional items, despite a 3% rise in equity volumes to 2.19 million
barrels of oil per day. That should climb over the next three years to
about 2.32 million bpd before tapering off although natural gas will
continue to move ahead sharply thanks to increased US production. Gas
sales last year were down 6% because of the mild European winter.
The downstream operations saw continued pressure on refining margins
with there being excess capacity in Europe and intense competition
although low margins on fuels were partially offset by better returns
from oil products. The star performance came from chemicals where there
was a #575m swinground from losses of #73m into #502m surplus before
special charges of #162m in the US relating to litigation and asset
write-downs.

THE letter from Alex J Thomson makes a rather odd assertion, that a
crime cannot be committed if there is no legislation to the contrary
(February 17). Has he not heard of the war crimes tribunal at Nuremberg?
Much of our legislation is retrospective. Some years ago a shopkeeper
in Scotland was convicted of selling solvent and plastic bags to
children for the purpose of glue-sniffing. Following this case
Parliament passed an Act making such sales illegal in England and Wales,
but no mention was made of Scotland. That was not necessary, for the
court findings had already spoken for Scotland.
Evidently what the shopkeeper did was a crime, not only after the Act
of Parliament and the court decision but also before that, at the time
the sale took place. We need case law, otherwise the ingenuity of the
criminal would get the better of us.
You have to be careful in claiming legality for your actions. The calf
exporters are doing that now. Just over 130 years ago, people in the
Confederate states of America were making the same claim about slavery.

IT ill behoves Lord McCluskey to make what must be uninformed comment
on matters of which I suspect he has scant knowledge (February 21).
As a judge in Scotland's Supreme Court, his remarks regarding ''poor
quality lawyers'' must be directed to the Faculty of Advocates, whose
members will constitute the majority of those who plead before him. They
are no doubt well able to fight their own corner.
If Lord McCluskey is using the term ''lawyer'' in its usual sense of
solicitor then he is definitely a bit remote although perhaps not a
doddering dimwit.
He compares lawyers' fees to teachers' and nurses' wages. Turnover
does not equal profit and it is perhaps this error which leads Lord
McCluskey to believe, on what evidence we know not, that most lawyers
are being overpaid.
He refers to lawyers as ''not popular'' so has clearly not read the
many press reports on the results of the recent Government survey
showing that 85% of those surveyed were so happy with their solicitor
that they would use him/her again.
The interventionist role he seeks for judges has been available in the
Sheriff Court, where solicitors do most of their work, for more than a
year now, as have systems designed to speed litigation and so reduce
costs.
Certainly judges should not be silent but perhaps should speak only on
topics where they are informed and have something sensible to say.

WHILE there is no link between the English football hooligans and the
Tory Party, I do suggest the common misuse of the Union flag is a ploy
that should cease forthwith.
The hooligans drape themselves in the Union flag and then mouth
obscenities and perform arm-jerk Nazi-style salutes.
The Tory Party uses a fragmented quarter of the colours to illustrate
its allegiance to Crown and country.
The misuse is wrong in both instances. The mob element's use is banal
and sinister. The Tory misuse smacks of arrogance, suggesting that only
they are committed to a United Kingdom of the future.

ON the 15th of February the English fans rampaged through Dublin. They
did, as I have discovered from chums of mine in Ireland's capital, a bit
of rampaging in that fair city on the night before, the 14th of
February. St Valentine's Day.
One can perhaps be excused for suggesting that the gardai might have
had some justification for a re-enactment of the Chicago Massacre
themselves.
Certainly the sight of the returning English yobs, all shaved heads,
sticky-out tongues, and somehow inchoate features, faces like snotters
sliding, would lead even the most liberal of us to a wee modest proposal
to deal with the lumpen. It is said that veal calves being transported
to Britain panicked. ''Jesus,'' cried the wee doe-eyed animals, ''thank
God for the cages: they'll keep us away from the animals.''
Now as it happens I was enjoying a burst of the Emerald Isle on the
very day myself. I was at a civilised wee concert being given by some of
the stars of Irish showbiz. Heading the bill at Glasgow's splendid City
Halls, (still one of the foremost European concert halls for sound, but
sadly in need of refurbishment), was a new or newish star on the Irish
circuit, Sean Wilson, and very good he was too, a bit like Daniel
O'Donnell without the mammy.
He possesses a deep resonant voice with a nice light tone at the high
notes. A young fellow, he looks as good as he sounds, and there was a
big turn-out for him. But, truth to tell, the audience had come not for
the new singing star, but for a lady called Philomena Begley. Philomena
was the guest on the show and billed as Ireland's Queen of Country, and
quite right too.
Let me tell you a bit about Philomena. She has been around a long time
and doesn't mind admitting it. She's been in the business 33 years,
started off long back with the duo Foster and Allen, after leaving the
hat factory in Tyrone where she worked.
She started at the top early, for possessed of a splendid voice, with
a large range, and nae shame -- Philomena isnae blate and liked
performing from the very first -- she moved from being a rare chanter at
a party to being very professional indeed. So professional that she
could sing the American girl country singers into oblivion.
IRELAND has, of course, a tradition which has slipped away from the
Scots, even if the earliest influences in American country music were
originally as Scottish (and Ulster or Scotch-Irish) as from that small
country Brendan Behan once dubbed John Bull's Other Island. It helps,
though, the Irish accent.
Despite the laudable attempts of such chaps as the Proclaimers and
Peter Nardini, the Scottish accent does not seem to sit well in popular
music, and the Irish one does. And what is more, the kind of snobbery
which afflicts Scottish music, from the rigidities of the Scottish folk
scene, to the rigor mortis of symphonic pomposities, does not appear in
Ireland where people are more than happy to listen of a night in the
public house to a Hank Williams ditty followed by an English music-hall
song, and in between sad laments for Ireland's past.
And Philomena has all of that. I can still greet at a very silly and
sentimental but touching song straight out of the Edwardian era. ''She's
just a treasure sent down from above/ Just made for mummy and daddy to
love/ She is our pleasure that means all the world/ She's just her mummy
and daddy's little girl''. Trite? Maybe. What real people with wee girls
whom they love dearly think? Yes. The strength of such music is exactly
that.
Ms Begley, herself with three children and a smashing husband called
Tom Quinn and no airs or graces about her, knows full well her audience,
and her audience no full well about her. Her last song is practically an
anthem to ordinary people's solidarity and would jerk a tear out of
Goering. The Way Old Friends Do had the audience, largely Glasgow-Irish,
largely working class, holding hands with each other and swaying. I was
swaying myself along with my companion and for once it wasn't the drink.
But I did have a drink with Philomena afterwards and a nice chat too.
Then I knew what makes the music. And what makes it so vibrant in
Ireland, and what makes Philomena Begley a real star, and no
sentimentality about this. It isn't just the voice or the spangled
dresses. Nor even the songs or the tradition. It is stars being one of
us. The us who are decent. The English footy fans wouldn't know anything
about that at all.

THE number of dairy farmers in the UK is set to fall by as many as
2500 over the next few years, according to a leading nutrition expert
and that opinion is also shared by one of Scotland's top milk producers.
Speaking yesterday in Renfrew at the presentation of the annual BOCM
Pauls' forage awards, the company's ruminant adviser, Bruce Woodacre,
said: ''All the indications suggest that there will be far fewer dairy
farmers around in the near future.
''Estate agents all over the country say that they have a large number
of dairy farms to sell this year. With land and quota prices at current
levels it could be a sensible decision for many.''
The winner of both the Scottish and UK titles, Billy Kilpatrick from
Craigie Mains near Kilmarnock, took a similar line when he commented:
''It must be a very attractive proposition for someone approaching
retirement age and who has no sons to follow him. It's an opportunity to
capitalise on a very valuable asset.''
Mr Kilpatrick, who runs a herd of 150 Holstein Friesian cows and is
currently the chairman of the breed society, produced a superb high dry
matter silage with a D value of 75 to come out top in the UK from a
total of 9463 entries, knocking 20p per litre off his feed costs.
However, Mr Woodacre warned that making a good silage was only part of
the story. ''Making silage is often a triumph of determination over the
conditions but it's got to be turned into money. Never before has it
been so important to have effective utilisation.
''Silage analyses are one thing and all they really say is that the
product has a specific potential. The whole business depends on how it's
used.''
Mr Charles Young, BOCM Pauls technical manager, said that first cut
silage quality in Scotland during 1994 had been the best for many years
but added that later cuts were more variable and that many dairy farmers
had noticed a drop in intake recently with a subsequent drop in
production. That, he added, ''might be no bad thing this year with so
many producers over quota''.
Results: Clamp Silage -- 1, William Kilpatrick; 2, Robert Smith,
Corwar Outon, Whithorn; 3, J W Mitchell &amp; Son, Innerdunning, Dunning,
Perthshire.
Big Bale Silage -- 1, John Ramsay, Whitefield, Glenluce; 2, Alan
Ramsay, Gillespie Farm, Glenluce; 3, Andrew Douglas, Dampton,

THE sky may well be the limit for future demand for vegetable oils,
according to Richard Matthews, former managing director of United
Oilseeds.
The demand will be fuelled -- almost literally -- by emergence of
biodiesel as a non-
polluting energy source, particularly for urban areas and by the
pent-up demand due to be unleashed by the Chinese.
Speaking at the Agra Europe Outlook conference in London, he predicted
this would lead to the area limitations for oil seed crops laid down in
the Blair House agreement being scrapped and the agreement torn up.
Even accepting the wide gap in production costs between ''black''
mineral diesel and biodiesel of up to 20p per litre, he said governments
would have to act because of the polluting effects of black diesel in
built-up areas.
''As more work is done the environmentally beneficial results of
biodiesel become more and more apparently. Where governments recognise
this -- in Austria, Germany, France and Italy -- so stimulus is being
given biodiesel production from oil seeds grown on set-aside land.
''It is only a matter of time that the evidence for restricting diesel
use in urban centres to biodiesel alone is so overwhelming that duty
concessions will appear and biodiesel will actually go to a premium at
the pump to black diesel. In turn this will mean that the production
requirement will run past what can be produced from set-aside land.''
If that was not enough, he predicted soaring demand from the 1.2
billion population of China which had already been the main driving
force in the upswing in world oil prices last year. This was on the
basis of an additional import of two million tonnes per annum against
their consumption of 10 million tonnes.
The trend would change the price relationship between protein and oil
from oil seeds in favour of the latter and thus generally in favour of
soft seeds such as oilseed rape. Rapeseed breeding for new values as
specialist uses has been able -- and will continue to be bale -- to
outstrip hard seeds such as soya beans.
''This will start to take rapeseed oil out of its traditional
positions as a commodity oil and divorce its value from soya bean oil
where breeding will never be able to respond in the same way and soya
bean oil will be left behind in the commodity sector,'' said Mr
Matthews.

SIDLAW has severed its link with its Dundee origins by agreeing to
sell its jute and flax-spinning activities as well as textile trading to
J&amp;F Spinners for not more than #2.5m of which #2m has already been paid
in cash.
The deal means that the company no longer has any connection with its
imperial past when jute was imported from the Indian sub-continent for
the manufacture of sacking and the backing for carpets.
The move comes as little surprise because chief executive Digby Morrow
said in October that he intended selling the textile activities when he
announced a #23.7m rights issue. That was at 180p compared with last
night's closing price of 149p.
The division has had a difficult time in recent years. It became
increasingly marginal compared with the mainstream packaging activities
since the #79m purchase of Courtaulds Flexible Packaging in 1993 and oil
support services which came into the company in 1966 as a diversifiation
away from textiles.
The Greengauge sports surfaces business has gone and now only the face
yarn operation remains. Mr Morrow said he was holding discussions with
several interested parties to acquire a subsidiary which has two Dundee
factories employing 300 people. The jute and flax-spinning operations
employ 200 people and made a profit last year of #157,000 with net
assets of #5.24m.
J&amp;F Spinners is a newly formed consortium headed by Edward Wright
which is interested in jute and trading.
Mr Morrow said that he is pleased that Sidlaw has been able to
preserve the continuity of the business by selling it as a going
concern.

I decided it was time to go. After all, I had the essential trophy --
the catalogue . . .
Crammed full of goodies, a shopper's dream, but the nearest one is on
the other side of the border. Deedee Cuddihy went to pay homage at that
'cathedral of consumerism' the IKEA store in Newcastle
CAN you remember way back when Scotland didn't have a branch of
Habitat? And the excitement when we got our first one? Then we longed
for Sainsbury's, and eventually got one -- even though it was in
Edinburgh.
(I can recall almost swooning when my sister-in-law, following a
maiden visit, unpacked Sainsbury's mayonnaise and Sainsbury's
French-style yoghurts from a Sainsbury's carrier bag).
Now we want IKEA. Most people, I reckon, have heard of IKEA by now.
It's a huge home-furnishing store which is kind of like Habitat was when
it first started only a lot bigger, cheaper, and with a much wider
appeal.
IKEA is famous for being Swedish. Indeed, if I may quote from the
company's corporate brochure: ''IKEA has its roots in Smaland,
historically one of Sweden's poorest regions, where the harsh
countryside demands thrift, inventiveness, and hard work. It is here
that Ingvar Kamprad was born in 1926 on a farm called Elmtaryd, a few
miles outside Almhult.''
Ingvar began selling cut price furniture in the early 1950s. He's
still in charge of the company, which now has around 200 branches
worldwide, and a lot of the business is still conducted from Almhult
where the all-important catalogue is produced at IKEA's own studio.
Its first British store opened in Manchester in 1987. Now there are
five including the Newcastle IKEA which opened in 1992 near the Metro
Centre, a place for which the expression ''cathedral of consumerism''
may well have been invented.
Although news of IKEA reached Scotland shortly after the Manchester
store opened, it wasn't until the merchandise was put within a day's
reach of us at Tyneside that Scotland began agitating for an IKEA of its
own.
History has started repeating itself (remember Habitat and Sainsbury)
as increasing numbers of Scots make forays over the border by van, car,
and public transport to carry back booty from IKEA Newcastle.
My sister-in-law's been, of course. The whole family went, along with
the lodger who hired a truck for the day. They brought sandwiches with
them, had a great time and bought, among other coveted items, a
coat-stand and some kind of rack for the CD collection.
My friend Maryanne went last week and was very impressed when staff
let her fill up a whistling kettle from a tap in the ladies' toilet to
test -- before she bought it, (which she did) -- whether it dripped.
So now it was my turn, I decided. And such is the hunger in Scotland
for the IKEA experience I would not have been short of a good companion
for the trip -- had I wanted one.
But I couldn't help feeling that this particular pilgrimage was one
that I would be better to undertake alone. (Sorry Madge, but as you've
already been there anyway, and have that nice tablecloth and cutlery to
show for it, I know you won't bear me a grudge).
Onward to IKEA, then; a journey involving a painless
two-and-a-half-hour train ride to Newcastle Central followed by the
special shuttle bus to the Metro Centre where, instead of taking another
shuttle to IKEA, I walked to it through a sea of car parks.
I confess to feeling a flutter of anticipation as I drew near to the
store with its distinctive yellow and blue exterior. And then, at last,
I was inside where I found the atmosphere was not, as I had expected,
high-pressure and tense and just the teeniest bit precious, but low-key
and relaxed and very much geared to family groups who, it being the
half-term holiday, were much in evidence.
The sevens and under were being signed into the IKEA playroom, older
kids were lounging in the special children's cinema and there was a
crowd around the reception desk where mini-Dime bars, Swedish biscuits
and balloons were being given away in their hundreds.
I stashed my coat and rucksack in a locker and made straight for the
restaurant where I splashed out #5-odd on the best cafeteria-style meal
I've ever eaten -- potato-salad (garnished with three types of lettuce),
fried fish, and stir-fried veg.
And then there was the furniture. Well, what can I tell you? Dozens of
sofas, starting at #48 for a wickerwork two-seater; dining room tables
from #39; loft beds, teenage beds and beds big enough to hold Snow White
and all seven of the dwarfs. Twenty types of stools; hundreds of
different chairs; bedside tables, coffee tables, bookcases and shelves.
Carpets, curtains, 85-piece sets of stainless steel cutlery (for only
#86!); lamps, bog brushes, towels and bed linen; woks, wardrobes,
shoe-racks and filing cabinets.
Three hours, when I found myself contemplating the possibility of
humphing an attractive but bulky pine wall cabinet back up to Glasgow
with me that day or shelling out #133 to have it delivered to my home, I
decided it was time to go. After all, I had the essential trophy -- the
catalogue -- as proof that I had, at last, been to IKEA.
(I am reliably informed, by the way, that the company is shortly
expected to announce plans for a store in the Glasgow area.)

ROYAL Insurance is to share its 150th anniversary celebrations this

jump from 7.5p to 12p on respect of 1994.
The payout comes on the back of a leap in profits from #143m to #401m.
Earnings per share more than doubled from 23p to 52.7p.
''I am confident that these results and the ongoing firm management of
our business provide us with a strong base from which we can achieve
continuing success,'' said chief executive Richard Gamble.
''We intend to make the most of the opportunities available to us in
the worldwide markets in which we operate.''
The profits boost was achieved despite a reduction in total premium
income from #5125m to #4762m. Insurers generally are enjoying the
benefits of firmer premium rates, a more selective approach to customers
and a fall-off in major claims, helped by improved weather conditions.
Royal's general insurance arm in the UK saw profits jump by #224m to
#321m. Life assurance operations reported a 35% rise to #46m.

A COMBINATION of restructuring during the past few years, an upturn in
economic conditions around the world and selective price increases were
responsible for a strong financial performance from ICI last year.
Outgoing chairman, Sir Denys Henderson, who retires in April, said he
was ''very pleased to be able to go out on a high note''.
There were volume improvements in all businesses in all major
territories. Subsequently, pre-tax profits were at the top end of City
expectations at #514m before exceptional items, an 84% improvement on
the 1993 result. Turnover was up by 9% at #9200m and earnings per share
before exceptional items rose from 19.6p to 37.3p.
ICI intends to continue its drive to improve dividend cover and so
despite the impressive earnings growth the total shareholders' payment
for the year was held at 27.5p after a final dividend of 17p.
However, restructuring of activities within the group is to continue
as it strives to maximise shareholder value. The explosives business is
the next in line for an overhaul with the subsequent loss of 400 jobs in
the UK, about 200 of them arising from the closure of the initiating
systems facility at Ardeer in Ayrshire.
This facility has been loss-making for several years following a
marked downturn in demand for explosives and initiating systems from the
coal-mining sector, notably in the UK but also in export markets. The
decision to close the Ardeer plant was announced earlier this month with
the manufactucture of detonators on the site due to be phased out by the
end of October. The explosives division made #6m lower profits last year
at #45m despite higher sales.
In contrast, there were was a strong performance from industrial
chemicals where the businesses benefited from productivity improvements
and firmer prices for most of its chemical and polymer products.
Pressure on margins continues to be intense in those businesses with
exposure to consumer markets. Despite this ICI's world-famous Dulux
brand managed to increase its share of the competitive price-conscious
UK market. Overall, the paints division made a record profit of #122m.
Strong cashflow within the group resulted in a marked improvement in
the balance sheet during the year. Borrowings fell by #357m to #139m
equivalent to gearing of just 3.3%. In ''normal'' conditions a company
such as ICI could be expected to have gearing of 20%-30%.
Although economic growth is slowing down in the UK and US, ICI is
confident that its businesses are well placed to continue to make
progress not least because of its sizeable investment in the
fast-growing countries of South-east Asia such as Malaysia and China.
City analysts chose to focus on the static dividend and ICI shares
were marked down 7p to 715p.

THE ability of Conrad Black to surprise the City remains undiminished
with his proposal that he will buy back the outstanding 41.5% of The
Telegraph through a res-structuring of his media empire with about 400
newspapers across the world.
Shares in the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph publisher soared
54p to 434p where they capitalise the whole company at #585m and the
minority at #243m.
This was accompanied by 1994 profits which showed how severely the
price war has hit since it broke out last June, costing over #15m at the
pre-tax level. However the impact on operating profits is much more
severe with the cut in the cover price from 48p to 30p to compete with
the Times at 20p resulting in a slight #200,000 loss in the second half
with full year profits down from #42.9m to #20.1m. Turnover was #4m
lower at #252m.
The solace is that advertising revenues rose 13% to #153m with
classified ahead by 21.7% and display up 10.5%. However the 18p drop in
the cover price reduced circulation revenue by #23.5m to #90m although
there has been a recovery in circulation in both titles.
Operating profits were also affected by promotional costs and by
rationalisation expenses. The pre-tax figure of #45m was bolstered by
the associate companies including the 25% owned John Fairfax publishing
business in Australia.
The Telegraph is desperately hoping that Rupert Murdoch's News
International will relent on the pricing front -- it is already doing so
with the Sun where there has been an extra 1p restored in the last week.
But it dare not move until several pence is added onto The Times cover
price at a time when newsprint prices are rising by up to a quarter.
Telegraph shareholders are being advised by the board to take no
action at present and until formal proposals are submitted .

THERE has been much publicity over the demonstrations against the
construction of the M77. Little is being said about the proposal to
build the M74 northern extension on the South Side of Glasgow to link
with the M8.
While this will not involve passing through an area of major parkland,
it will cause a loss of leisure, play, and other recreational amenities
for people living along its proposed path.
In addition, there will be a loss of some commercial properties in two
industrial estates, the sacrifice of at least five listed buildings (one
in Category A), and further adverse effects on the amenity of the Co-op
building, one of the city's loveliest.
Many homes along the route of the motorway are also expected to suffer
adverse visual effects.
It is to be hoped that those individuals (and interested groups) who
are affected by this proposal will make their feelings and observations
known to the planners without delay rather than wait until construction
begins.
One fears, however, that the current exhibitions of the M74 proposal
are to provide information only.

I AM pleased that you reported the great Scottish time trial set up on
the initiative of the Scottish Geographical Society to debate the
question of the UK adopting Central European Time, thus bringing this
important matter to the attention of the general public (February 18).
You quote Mr Angus Crichton-Millar, director of the Rank Organisation,
asserting that ''our case was stronger . . . but we didn't have enough
Scottish accents''.
How sad it is that such a thought was raised. I was at the trial and
in my mind the defenders of the status quo won the day on argument.
The argument for change claimed an extra hour of daylight in the
evening in winter would make our roads safer, but it was shown that
statistically throughout the year, winter and summer, there is an
increasing number of road accidents through the day from morning to
peak, about 5pm to 6pm.
Could a factor other than light, such as the tiredness of people after
a day at work and/or the exuberance of children on their way home from
school in peer groups, not be a more significant factor?
The Scottish Chamber of Commerce representative argued that it would
make business with Europe more efficient and easy. Easier for whom?
Clearly it would make life easier for a number of executives and
salesmen: but should we change the lifestyle of the whole population to
please a tiny minority of people when they could adapt their working
hours to suit their customers as they do across North America with four
to five time zones?
The deputy chief executive of Strathclyde Regional Council and the
representatives of the Scottish Farmers' Union and the Royal Mail,
together with Dr Hutchison, a geographer, won the day for the status quo
with reasoned argument.

<HEADLINE>Outlook for inflation has worsened, says CBI survey</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>CHRIS STONE,CITY EDITOR</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>979697845</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE inflation outlook, at least in the near term, has worsened,
according to the Confederation of British Industry's Monthly Trends
Enquiry for February, which also shows strong overall and export demand.
More firms expect to increase prices than reduce them over the next
four months with the positive balance of 31% little changed from
January's 33%, a month which would have been artificially inflated by
new list prices.
James Capel's Adam Cole has estimated that a drop in the balance to
23% for February would have indicated no change in the underlying trend.
So on that basis, the pressures look ominously upward with the threat
that Chancellor Kenneth Clarke will have to raise base rates again
despite three increases in the past six months to keep the lid on
inflation.
The CBI, though, said yesterday it is worth bearing in mind that five
out of every 10 firms expect prices to remain unchanged over the four
months ahead. Price expectations also continue to vary unevenly across
industry sectors.
Kate Barker, the CBI's chief economic adviser, said: ''We continue to
think that inflation will remain fairly subdued without the need for
sharp rises in bank base rates.''
The CBI was not in favour of the last base rate rise which it did not
regard as neccessary. The confederation considers that with economic
growth moderating and competitive conditions remaining fierce, the
medium-term goal for inflation still looks to be on course.
Specifically, headline inflation is expected to increase to 3.8% by
the end of this year, before falling to 3.4% by the end of 1996.
Underlying inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, is expected
to remain above its 2.5% medium-term target through 1995, but to achieve
that target in 1996.
Reflecting near-term inflation worries, the CBI forecast assumes that
interest rate rises will be brought forward, with rates expected to peak
at 7[1/2]% in the fourth quarter of 1995 and to stabilise in 1996.
UK manufacturers have recorded their best levels of export order books
since this question was first raised in the survey in April 1977.
Twenty-nine per cent of companies said export order books were above
normal, and 16% below normal -- a positive balance of 13%.
Overall demand is also strong with a positive balance of 13% of firms
reporting above normal order books for February, the highest figure
since December 1988.
This is reflected in manufacturers' output expectations. Output is
projected to increase markedly over the next four months at the fastest
rate since March 1988.
The CBI itself is forecasting that the UK economy will grow by 3.2%
this year and by 2.9% in 1996. The projected rate of growth, though
slower than in 1994, will generate further falls in unemployment which
is projected to drop to 1.9 million in 1996.
Mr Junankar added: ''Employment growth, encouragingly, is expected to
continue over the next two years, taking the number of jobless to below
two million in 1996. This should underpin the projected increases in
consumer spending of around 2[1/2]% in both 1995 and 1996.
''Even so, the desirable rebalancing of the economy, away from public
and private consumption and towards exports and investment, is likely to
be sustained.''
The forecast economic growth for 1995 has been revised upwards by
nearly half-a-percentage point since the CBI's last forecast in
November, reflecting stronger-than-anticipated economic growth in the
second half of last year.
Export growth has also been revised upwards, reflecting an improved
outlook for world trade. Exports are expected to grow by 8.5% this year

TRAFALGAR HOUSE duly raised its hostile bid for Northern Electric
yesterday but far from the ''knockout'' #13 a share which had been
expected by some more excitable sectors of the market, it was lifted
from 1048p to just 1100p, the barest minimum that was thought likely.
Northern had put an implied value of 1400p a share on itself but this
was felt to be over the top. Even so, Trafalgar surprised some analysts
in coming in at the lowest level though the more realistic had pitched
their hopes at around 1150p.
Not so surprising was Northern Electric's immediate rejection of this
final offer as ''wholly inadequate'' and a repeat of its previous case
against becoming part of Trafalgar.
Trafalgar's terms are #44 in cash and 75 new Trafalgar House
Convertible Preference shares for every 10 Northern Electric shares,
valuing them at 1081p. But it is the full cash alternative of 1100p a
share, valuing the group at approximately #1230m, that the market
concentrated on.
Northern's shares fell 75p to stand below the bid price at 1053p. This
would seem to imply either that it was felt that institutions would now
go ahead and accept or that the new terms were simply not good enough to
carry the day and nothing more can now be expected with no rival bidder
on the horizon.
If the bid was to be turned down, though,it would depress all the
English electricity shares which have been buoyed by expectations,
doubtless exaggerated, of a round of takeovers in the sector triggered
by Trafalgar.
Trafalgar left itself open to counter attack when it said that results
for the first half of the year, which be announced in May, will
inevitably be affected by compensation paid to QE2 passengers.
Overall, Cunard is expected to show an operating loss and this,
together with the lower earnings from engineering foreshadowed in the
chairman's statement at the year-end, is likely to mean a half-year loss
and disappointing full-year results.
Group debt has increased as a result of capital expenditure on ships
and property and the working capital requirements of other businesses,
although the trend should level off in the second half.
Nigel Rich, Trafalgar's chief executive, said that Northern Electric
shareholders now have a decision to make. ''Shareholders must compare
the certainty of our final offer with Northern Electric's alternative
package, with all its risks and uncertainties both for the health of the
business and for the value of their shares.''
Northern Electric's chairman, David Norris, said that ''by accepting
this inadequate offer, shareholders would be giving up real and
significant value for Northern Electric's proposals.''

How do you change the perception of an event which has suffered from
an elitist image?
TAXI drivers, as any journalist will tell you, regard themselves as
the human barometers of any city. Their opinions (and they have them in
spades, of course) are often a kind of warped reflection of the social
pulse of a community. So when the driver of the black hack taking you to
the Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival of a summer's day writes off the
event as ''arty-farty'' you really have to take notice.
Mark Cousins, appointed in November last year as the festival's
director, has had more than his fair share of taxi journeys around the
city over the past few months -- so he is perfectly well aware of the
perception. He doesn't agree with it but he is the first to admit that
in the past the two-week event has suffered, somewhat unfairly, from a
misplaced elitist image.
''Cinema is a populist thing and it is important for our plans to
ensure that the festival will make an impact on the city as a whole this
year,'' he says.
This is not, repeat not, an early warning that under Mark Cousins the
festival is selling out to mainstream cinema. It is simply a promise to
accentuate the positive; to get across the message that movies, from
Hollywood to Helsinki, from Glasgow to Gdansk, are of universal
interest.
Cousins, a 29-year-old Ulsterman and honours graduate from Stirling
University's film school, loves movies (which is just as well for a man
in his position). But for him it is an all-consuming passion. Film, he
says, is a young art but it is the greatest art. He can appreciate books
and paintings but film is the only art form which has touched him
deeply. Now he is a little like the wee boy who was given the keys to
the sweetie shop.
Along with his colleague Ginnie Atkinson, the festival's producer, he
intends to turn the event on its head by restructuring its format. In
the past it has suffered from having more strands than a plate of
spaghetti and that, they say, has run its course. Under the pair's
guidance, the 1995 event will be simplified with just four principal
sections. It should make for a more effective and a more user-friendly
fortnight.
''Each of the four elements in the structure are attempting to be new
because there are now almost too many film festivals around the world.
There are so many that they are in danger of saturating the market. We
have to be original and we must keep ahead of the game,'' explains
Cousins.
His most important and ambitious innovation will be a complete
departure for the festival and it is something which no-one else has
done before. The plan is to take a small cinema in the city for the
duration of the festival and dedicate it to showing everything -- yes,
everything -- which has been made in Britain over the previous year. It
will, he hopes, become the leading shop window for the screen trade in
the UK, an attempt to put the festival on the industrial as well as the
cultural map.
''It will be almost like a film festival fringe. Some festivals call
it a side bar. It will be aimed mainly at talent spotters -- film and TV
buyers, video buyers, and film makers themselves. We have already lined
up a very important film industry figure to co-ordinate the section and
to show that it has to be taken very seriously.
''We won't keep the public out but it will really be for the trade.
There will be no quality threshold for films to pass. Everything that
has been made in Britain will be there,'' he says.
The festival, which in the past has confined itself to the Cameo
Cinema and the Edinburgh Filmhouse, is also planning to increase the
bums-on-seats factor by making use of bigger cinemas for a special
section on ''crowd-pleasing'' films. Does this suggest that the event,
after all, is moving more towards the mainstream?
''No. As well as, say, American and Australian films there are many
foreign language films which are still very popular with larger
audiences. We are confident that the audience will trust us enough with
the programme,'' explains Cousins.
Another significant change will be a massive increase in the number of
first-showings of foreign movies in the new World and International
Premiere section. There will be a fourth strand to the festival but
Cousins teasingly declines to reveal details for the moment. It will,
however, be an ''exciting development''.
He concedes that there will be no Shallow Grave equivalent at this
year's festival but, asked about the possibility of any major Scottish
input in the year when Hollywood discovered Scotland, he says: ''One of
the first things we did was to go down and meet the major distributors
in London and get a good working relationship going with them. We have
tried to argue the importance of them premiering in Edinburgh.''
Since it was Mark Cousins who, as director of programmes for last
year's festival, re-introduced the ''directors' retrospectives'' (with a
look back at the work of Hollywood's enfant terrible Andre de Toth and
Japanese master Imamura) it will come as no great surprise to discover
that the concept will continue in 1995.
This year it is the turn of Stanley Donen, the American director and
choreographer best remembered for Forties Gene Kelly musicals like
Singin' In The Rain and On The Town. Now 70 and still working, Donen is
looking forward to his role as resident movie director at this year's
event. Recently he has been teaching at the Sundance Institute in
America and is said to be very keen to help the younger generation of
film makers.
''I've been very concerned that cinema appears to be such a slave to
fashion. It is Quentin Tarantino at the moment. To be an 'interesting
figure' in movies you seem to have to be young and very hip. But these
older directors from an earlier period have so much experience that
people like Tarantino can't even begin to touch them,'' explains
Cousins.
''I know that Gene Kelly was one of the first people in the cinema
that had an impact on me. When you follow Donen's career you see that
his earlier films were all about joy but his later films -- like Two For
The Road and Indiscreet -- have both a sadness and a melancholy around
them. There is a great deal of human value to his work,'' adds Cousins.
All of this, of course, will cost money but, thanks to some prudent
husbandry by Ginnie Atkinson, this year's budget should be broadly in
line with last year's.
It has to be said that this year she started at a financial
disadvantage. In 1994, because Drambuie announced a new three-year
sponsorship deal, the festival qualified for assistance from the
business-in-arts sponsorship scheme. But sadly not this year. In
addition, the British Film Institute (which gave #15,000 last year) is,
somewhat churlishly, declining to help film festivals beyond that of
London's.
''These factors should not really affect the final budget because we
should have the same as we had last year. In addition, we are
negotiating a courtesy deal with a major airline which should help to
bring more stars to the festival. We are also hoping to attract more
'in-kind' assistance from other sources,'' explains Atkinson.
Another innovation, she says, will be the introduction of a two-tier
ticket scheme, one involving a simple registration fee with no cinema
tickets. This is a recognition of the fact that some people, usually
budding young film makers, just want to ''hang out'' at the festival and
don't necessarily want to go to the movies.

AT last, from Dr Miriam Stoppard (The joys of planning, February 16),
we have an article describing fertility awareness as an aspect of good
health and every woman's birthright.
For more than 30 years natural family planning (NFP) associations
throughout Britain have taught these simple facts to thousands of women,
couples, and schoolchildren.
The natural approach is constantly ridiculed, but extensive scientific
research and trials have shown that modern methods of NFP can very
accurately predict the time of ovulation without the use of expensive
home monitor kits.
Also women can plan to avoid pregnancy as well as conceive once they
have knowledge of NFP. Experienced teachers are found at any of our 24
Scottish centres.
Clients are given individual tuition free. We are supported by the
Scottish Home and Health Department as a registered Scottish charity.

LORD HOPE is to be congratulated on publicly questioning the extremely
restrictive nature of evidence allowed in the Court of Appeal. Your
report says: ''The judicial system has to keep up to date with new
developments, human rights, and public confidence.'' Lord Ross appears
to be less enthusiastic.
Scottish Court of Appeal legislation appears at least 70 years out of
date.
George Bernard Shaw said in the 1920s: ''It matters not a jot who is
punished provided somebody is punished and the public persuaded he is
guilty. The effect of imprisoning the wrong man is as deterrent as
imprisoning the right one.
''This is the fundamental explanation of the extreme reluctance to
release a prisoner when the evidence on which he was convicted has
become discredited to a point at which no jury would maintain its
verdict of guilty.
''The reluctance is not to confess that an innocent man is being
punished but to proclaim that a guilty man has escaped. If escape is
possible, deterrence shrinks to almost nothing.''
Little has changed since Shaw penned this essay. Men in Scotland are
at present serving long, harsh prison sentences for crimes they were not
involved in.
Some have gathered ample evidence to prove their innocence but are
denied a fair chance to present it because of technicalities imposed by
the Law Lords.
The legal establishment stands accused of being prejudicial in
covering up police malpractice and corruption. Appeal Court decisions
are seen to be made in the interest of the Establishment; human rights
and truth are of little consequence.
Public support is with Lord Hope.

ISN'T it a little insensitive of the Tories to appoint as Scottish
Industry Minister the only MP who has run down the family firm and put
200 out of work? Perhaps a little reshuffling would have been
appropriate, with George Kynoch given prisons and nature conservancy to
start off with.
On Wednesday, Kynoch of Keith made his debut at Scottish Questions on
the floor of the Commons. Someone had apparently told him that the best
way to answer a question is to attack the questioner. It was a
performance which won him no friends or goodwill, and which makes it
entirely relevant to question his credentials in this post.
When Adam Ingram asked about Rolls-Royce, which is by any standard a
key Scottish industrial issue at the moment, there were no words of
constructive interest. Instead, Adam was tartly advised to ''place the
changes in Rolls- Royce in the context of world affairs'' and to ''start
talking Scottish prospects up rather than down''. Well, thanks a lot.
Similarly, Irene Adams drew attention to the fact that 80% of
manufacturing jobs in her constituency had disappeared since 1979. This
seemed a sufficiently dramatic statistic to demand a rational response
from someone calling himself the Industry Minister. Instead Irene was
told, rather oddly, to stop ''selling Scotland down the river''.
This brand of empty-minded rudeness tells a lot about why the Tories
are at their current depths in Scotland. There have been Ministers of
that affiliation in the past who saw it as their public duty to promote
manufacturing, and particularly the great Scottish engineering
tradition, rather than throw political cliches on its grave, which is
apparently how George Kynoch interprets his role.
And while it is standard political banter to attack Labour's proposals
for devolved government with tax-raising powers, it is perhaps imprudent
of Mr Kynoch to advertise this as the greatest threat facing industry
and employment in Scotland. As he is well qualified to know, thousands
of good and long-established businesses have gone down in the past 16
years under the constitutional status quo.
But it was on railways that Kynoch of Keith implemented lesson one of
the ministerial crash course -- never give an inch to truth and
frankness if it gets in the way of political convenience. When the issue
of overnight trains and sleepers came up it was he who was put up to
answer.
Incidentally, it is quite important to talk of ''overnight services''
rather than just sleepers, since the people who have been neglected
entirely in the course of this debate are the substantial numbers who
cannot afford sleepers and sit up throughout the journey. That part of
the service will not exist on any Anglo-Scottish route if the present
proposals go ahead.
But back to Kynoch of Keith. Two weeks ago he was sitting a few feet
away when Sir Hector Monro gave an unambiguous assurance to the Scottish
Grand Committee that there would be full and formal consultation under
the Railways Act before any of these services could be withdrawn.
Everyone present -- including the media, Allan Stewawrt, and a large
contingent from Highland Regional Council -- knew what was said and what
was meant.
But when the issue was raised this week, Mr Kynoch said something
quite different. He read from his script: ''Consultations on the
ScotRail franchise will start after the passenger service requirement is
published, probably in May.'' What that means is that consultation will
begin after the services in question have been dropped from the May
timetable and abolished. And that is not consultation at all.
Later in proceedings, Ian Lang also made clear that this was now the
Scottish Office line, which means that he has lost out in his
discussions with the Department of Transport. They are determined that
the unilateral action of the franchise director, Mr Roger Salmon, should
stand and that there will be no advance consultation.
Let us for the moment suppose that old Hector made a mistake or talked
out of turn. It would be embarrassing for George Kynoch or Ian Lang to
say so. But on the Richter scale of disgraces which Mr Lang has survived
it would not register very high, and at least it would be an honest
statement of the position which he has apparently arrived at.
What is unacceptable, and greatly demeans the Scottish Office, is the
attempt to deny that the promise of consultation was ever given by Sir
Hector Monro. This is surreal in its dishonesty. It is disproven by the
written and taped record as well as by the recollections of everyone
present. Why do they dispute this?
The principle at stake with Motorail and overnight services is crucial
to the whole future of privatisation. Either the franchise director has
the sole right to get rid of services by removing financial support, or
he does not. The Tories are determined that he must have that power if
there is to be a rail network lean enough for the private sector to
inherit. And if he does, then start waving goodbye to every vulnerable
service in the network.
When Mr Major comes to Scotland today he should be asked about the
future of these services amid the other issues of priority. He should be
asked if the word of a Government Minister given in a House of Commons
committee is, any longer, worth the breath it is spoken with. It may not
be the biggest constitutional issue at the moment, but neither is it
insignificant.

THE Prime Minister arrives in Glasgow today without any message of
hope for the people of Scotland. Earlier in the week he arrived in
Belfast the bearer of genuine hope, and he was well received, as he
deserved to be, by all but the most intransigent of unionists.
Ironically -- as it is becoming almost routine to point out -- in
Scotland he will be well received only by the most intransigent of
unionists. Everyone else in Scotland -- and this includes those who
dearly wish to preserve the Union but realise that the way to do so is
to amend it -- will find it tiresome if he merely reiterates his tedious
''no change is needed -- if it ain't broke, don't fix it'' mantra. We
are, frankly, fed up with such tedious evasions. For the Scottish body
politic is indeed broken, and it desperately needs fixing. Mr Major
must, with urgency, do various things. He must listen, rather than
deliver homilies and lectures. He must ''take stock'', to use his own
phrase. And then he needs to deliver a blueprint for change, just as he
has done, bravely and imaginatively, across the water.
Time after time the Scottish people have voted for change. Not just in
General Election after General Election; these votes can, just about, be
explained away by saying that voters have other priorities than
constitutional change in their personal agendas at elections. But we
must never forget that the Scottish people did, in the referendum of
1979, vote specifically for change. The reaction to the constant
snubbing of their constitutional aspirations, by four separate Tory
administrations over 16 years, has been one of patient, sullen
acceptance. The great majority of the Scots people have not voted for
the past four governments, yet they have tholed what these disliked,
distant governments have visited on them with patience. A grudging
patience perhaps, but patience none the less. That fact encapsulates the
most significant difference between Scotland and Northern Ireland over
the past generation or so. Of course there are many other differences.
Scots know what these differences are and they do not need Mr Major and
Mr Lang to keep cataloguing them as if the Scottish nation were some
vast class of infants.
Mr Major can also point, somewhat glibly if correctly, to various
helpful (to him) economic statistics which indicate that Scotland is
doing better, and is better treated by central Government, than England
and Wales. But he will not refer to the most alarming and damning
statistics of all, which show that Scotland's population is declining
while that of England and Wales continues to rise. Scots have lost
confidence in the future; they have lost the self-respect which any
nation owes itself. That is the problem. It concerns Scotland's soul,
not its gut. Scots have behaved well while their reasonable aspirations
have been dismissed. They have not resorted to violence, they have not
rioted, they have not disrupted Parliament. Everything has been done by
the book. It is time for the constitutional book to be rewritten, as it
is being rewritten, with such vision and commitment, elsewhere in the
United Kingdom.

DESIGN for Living is the most subversive and dangerous of Noel
Coward's plays. Sean Mathias's production, by making explicit what the
playwright left largely implicit, underlines this fact.
In three acts a mix-and-match relationship develops between three
amoral hedonists -- Otto, a playwright, Leo, a painter and Gilda, the
girl who can't choose between them, and in the very end chooses them
both. Otto and Leo, bisexuals both, love each other as intensely as each
also loves Gilda -- a lively and athletic time is had by all.
Caught in the crossfire is Ernest (by name and by nature), an art
dealer who mistakenly marries Gilda but inevitably loses her to the
determined attack of Leo and Otto. Nicholas Clay gives Ernest the
presence and dignity his role deserves. Rachel Weisz repeats her
astonishing sensual performance from the earlier version of this
production at the much more intimate Donmar Theatre last year. Both Leo
(Marcus D'Amico) and Otto (Rupert Graves) are new -- an attractive,
contrasting and complementary pair who enjoy themselves and each other
hugely.
This revelatory production makes Design For Living seem newly minted.
Of course, in the thirties, when Coward wrote it, much of the action had
to be coded so as not to offend. Sean Mathias's highly effective
decoding of its sexual tangles makes the play vivid, shocking, yet
highly satisfying.

HARRY GIBSON'S adaptation of Irvine Welsh's sprawling chronicle of
Edinburgh smackheads is a distillation of various characters and
incidents, and it's 100% proof. Its effect is powerful; expect the odd
constriction of the chest, watering eyes, and blissful sensations. Booze
flows and heroin kicks in and the momentum of this Citizens' production
relentlessly escalates in adrenalin surges interspersed with awesome,
terrifyingly vacuous ramblings which, while often meaningless, are no
less compelling than the dynamic physical outbursts.
Gisbon's direction lets the actors reel out emotions then snaps them
taut, with junkies given to slobbering outbursts of affection suddenly
recoiling back into suspicious, selfish shells. Despite the rawness and
crudity of scenes which have one actor searching through faeces for
suppositories and another kneeling naked and shooting himself in the
groin, there is a finesse here which reveals rather than exposes the
pain that lies behind such indignities. There is harsh humour and
harrowing inhumanity but there is also love, kindness, and much evidence
of defensive but ardent friendship.
The set is grimy, belittered with porno mags and crisp pokes, with
bright, oppressive light; under its unforgiving glare the four-strong
cast give unflinching performances. Michelle Gomez is wrenchingly lost
as the junkie mother mourning her newly dead daughter by cooking up more
works, Ronnie McGann's initial effervescence melts into vulnerability as
his heroin addiction grows, Stuart Bowman is rivetingly horrific as the
hardman Franco and Owen Gorman is magnificent as Mark Renton, an
existentialist of our times, narrating the life he and his friends are
trapped in with dismayed detachment.

THERE is nothing in all music like the last 90 seconds of Charles
Ives's Second Symphony, where the composer unleashes a riot of
Americana, with the sheaves brought in from the Camptown Races with a
cavalry charge led by General George Custer (and he comes a cropper at
the end of this one, too).
And if that sounds crazy, then so should the ending of the symphony.
And that's where the weakness lay last night in an often magnificent
account of this neglected masterpiece in a programme of all-American
music given by the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra: conductor Richard
Bernas just wouldn't let it off the leash. While he caught a very great
deal of the intricacy and detail of Ives's complex textures, the whole
thing lacked dash and danger. The result? It sounded a bit
self-conscious.
But what a brilliant piece: gorgeous lyricism, zaniness, pastiche -- a
superb Tristan rush in the slow movement -- intense build-up to the
finale, and then off at the gallop (only it didn't quite). Still, a joy
to hear it, even if what has to be the worst turnout of the season left
the City Hall looking bare.
Roger Sessions's Piano Concerto is an oddball affair. A blistering
performance by Alan Feinberg seemed to suggest, behind a cloak of
modernism, an emotional work trying to get out -- its rhythmic energy
and obvious soulfulness just didn't get elbow room. Aaron Copland's
open-hearted Music for the Theatre, on the other hand, spoke jazzily for
itself.

LOWER-CLASS Len is young, perky, pawky, randy, cheeky, garrulous, and
generous. Yet despite this he is sad inside. Elsewhere inside, inside
his insides if you get my drift, Len's got a dicky liver. That's why
he's inside a hospital ward, bed-bound, awaiting a transplant, just like
stuck-up young Brian.
Pompous, repressed, stuck-up, middle-class Brian awaits a new kidney.
More vitally, Brian awaits the chance to meet someone like lower-class
Len, whose perky pawkiness can give him a humanity transplant. This
eventually comes to pass, but sadly not before author Bob Adams has
given Len some forced word-play and punnily-meaningless aphorisms to
utter. ''Has a donor doffed something I can don?'' was one unfortunate
example at last night's premiere. ''A week is a long time in
alcoholitics'' was another.
And there was a mawkish monologue about a dead OAP's false teeth --
''Old Josh has left a smile behind . . . more than I'll manage'' --
which Andrew Fairlie, investing Len with much understated verve, almost
managed to transform into something moving. Bustling: this was how Wendy
Seager tried to be more than a golden-hearted cipher as Nurse, while
Iain Andrew brought Kenny Dalglish's stone face to the role of Brian.
Nothing, however, could surmount a concluding outbreak of stilted
brittleness as Len and Brian debated their lives' respective worths.
Randy, lower-class Len, resigned to his self-defeating lack of ambition:
''An animal's got desires.''
Stuck-up Brian, trying to be positive: ''Your desires are not always
animal.''
Heartless Critic: ''As hard as the cast tried to breathe life into a
pulse-free text, Coming Apart fell apart, dead.''

Murray Ritchie,European Editor, reports that while the Celtic areas of
Europe are celebrating their common heritage the BBC should practise
what it preaches about nurturing cultural identity
THERE must be some people in Scotland who thought it a bit rich for Mr
John Birt, BBC director-general, to trumpet the need, as he did this
week in Brussels, for television to nurture our cultural identity and
heritage. Oh yes?
This, remember, came from the man whose television colleagues in
Scotland chose to ignore, again, the stupendous Celtic Connections
festival in Glasgow last month, claiming coverage would have been too
costly. The same man who is prepared to invest goodness knows how many
millions in endless episodes charting the low life and times of that
well-known cultural icon Rab C Nesbit, not to mention the memorably
cringe-inducing ''comedy'' series The High Life.
Mr Birt was in Brussels to acquaint Europeans with his views on
(pardon the jargon) the new digital superhighway. In non-Birtian
language this is the television and communication revolution in which
anything, more or less, will be possible in a switch-flicking instant,
provided you, the viewer, stump up. In a speech on Monday, Mr Birt
looked ahead at this trend in the so-called information society.
He imagined, probably accurately, a teenage schoolgirl 10 or 15 years
from now sitting down at home beside what he called her TelCom. The
TelCom will be a combined television, radio, computer, and telephone, Mr
Birt reckoned. For all I know, it will also be a hi-fi with built-in fax
and drinks cabinet.
This girl -- who must be a technological whizz -- tunes into a Dutch
pop station to which she is a subscriber, natch (no DJs or commercials).
She calls up a BBC science programme to help her with homework and then
delivers an essay to her teacher at home by E-mail one minute before it
is due.
This child genius then watches Act 5, Scene 4 of Moliere's L'Ecole des
Femmes -- in two separate productions -- to help with own performance in
a school play. Then she finishes her homework, hooks into her
video-phone chat circle for a blether with her pals all over Europe.
Mr Birt cleverly avoided mentioning the impoverishing cost of this
lassie's behaviour to her unfortunate parents. But then, he would,
wouldn't he, because the information society's digital superhighway is
really just another name for a communications system designed to make
billions for those who control it.
Mr Birt's main concern is that the BBC should be part of that control.
He had a splendid Birtian name for those putative fat-cat
super-highwaymen: digital gatekeepers. A digital gatekeeper, if allowed
to abuse his power, could kill competition and ruin consumer choice.
Since Mr Birt's vow is to extend choice, he wants part of the coming
action on behalf of the BBC.
Along the way, to the annoyance of the French, he has also come out
against quotas believing they should have no part in the digital
superhighway which is really just broadcasting, video, and telephone
systems going global but in a harmonised way with common standards. How
to regulate this communications explosion is the next big European
issue, politics apart, and will dominate the information society debate
at the Brussels G7 later this week.
But it was the culture argument which Mr Birt sought to employ most
earnestly. He said he sympathised with the French and others who took an
intense pride in their culture and who wanted quotas to protect it when
globalisation threatens. He sided, however, with the Portuguese who last
week denounced the French quota idea as more suitable for fish than
culture.
''The pressing issue for each member state of the EU now and in the
future will be to husband, to cherish, and to nurture our own unique
national identities and heritage,'' Mr Birt said, almost bringing a tear
to the eye. ''We should celebrate the rich and extraordinary diversity
of cultures in Europe,'' he insisted.
Why then does the BBC -- and it is by no means alone among Scottish
television stations -- ignore the blossoming of the Celtic culture which
is so popular these days, not just in Scotland but across the Celtic
nations and regions of Europe?
The Glasgow Celtic Connections festival is now established. This year,
I hear, it sold more than 50,000 tickets for 170 events over 17
successful days. Television can no longer complain that this renaissance
is merely a fad; it has been swelling for years and looks like
continuing to do so. Ceilidhs are popular again in the cities, after
years of being almost forgotten or confined to the islands, and there
are dozens of folk and folk/rock bands playing to huge audiences of
young and not-so-young enthusiasts.
Yet television continues to turn its back on this phenomenon. British
television, not just the BBC, seems to have money to spare only for
Gaels and Welsh speakers these days, but even they ignored the Celtic
Connections.
Yet if some clapped-out rock star turns up in Scotland, he is almost
automatically accorded television attention. The same goes for country
bands which no-one except a few aficionados has ever heard of. There
must be a misjudgment of priorities here. In our own country there is a
cultural heartbeat pounding excitingly and perhaps giving us a message
about Scotland's social, and even political, attitudes in a changing
Europe where it has ever-stronger cultural ties.
Mr Birt said in Brussels he had three priorities. They were full and
comprehensive reporting of the EU; reflecting European culture through
music and arts; and reflecting Britain to the rest of Europe.
After years of television's disservice to Scottish heritage, sometimes
reducing it over the years to mawkish tartanry and the Nesbit culture,
it must be time for Mr Birt and his colleagues to start practising what
they preach. A good start would be a closer look at Celtic Connections
next year -- I hear that is under consideration -- and perhaps a block
on Rab C Nesbit travelling south of Gretna.

Women are competing for jobs at the top of the prison service, once
considered a male bastion. James Freeman reviews their progress
THE mention of women in the context of governing Scottish prisons
immediately brings to mind Lady Martha Bruce, the charming aristocrat
who ruled first Gateside Women's Prison and then its modern replacement,
Cornton Vale, with the proverbial iron fist inside the velvet glove.
Lady Martha was a pioneer, a slight figure in a male-dominated world,
who remained something of a novelty item for a personality-hungry media
until her retiral in 1983.
Since then, there are more women involved in the management of
Scottish prisons, and, with cross-sex posting policies, there are now
more female officers serving on the halls and galleries of male jails
than there are serving in the sole women-only prison at Cornton Vale.
The novelty value has gone and the hierarchy of the Scottish Prison
Service operates a strong equal opportunities policy, but concern is
surfacing that women face a ''glass ceiling'' barring progress to the
very top of the service.
The focus falls on the succession at Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow,
Scotland's largest and busiest penal establishment -- a vast beehive
holding 1000 criminals in buildings well over 100 years old which have
resisted modernisation. With the leaving of Mr Peter Withers, the name
immediately on the lips of those who know the system is Mrs Kate
Donegan.
Could the tall, elegant Mrs Donegan, mother of two sons, become the
first female governor in charge of what should be the flagship prison in
the Scottish service, but which is in reality a tough, problem-ridden
posting? The chances are that she will not -- this time at least.
Mrs Donegan may have to be content with first taking charge in a
lesser prison before she reaches the very top, which she will
undoubtedly do if informed opinion is anything to go by. Her shortish
tenure of office as Barlinnie deputy and her high-profile membership of
the controversial staffing structure review team will probably not be
enough to sway the SPS board at this stage.
Whoever gets the Barlinnie job, the day cannot be long delayed when a
woman takes over a top, high-security, long-term prison in Scotland.
Eyebrows were raised last year when Mrs Sue Brookes, a slightly-built
30-year-old with an Oxford law degree (as well as one in criminology
from Edinburgh University), took over as governor-in-charge at the
Barlinnie Special Unit, a poisoned chalice of a posting if ever there
was one. The famous ''experiment'' was in its death throes, having lost
the way and was silted up with bitter, unyielding men determined to hang
on to their privileges to the last.
Mrs Brookes presided over the demise of the BSU and then leapt
straight into the front line a second time, being nominated to midwife
the imaginative National Induction Unit at Shotts Prison. That will not
be a bed of roses either.
Conceived as a means of heading off trouble before it bursts into life
in the mainstream, the unit will take in men who have just received
heavy sentences from the High Court and who face the syndrome best
described as ''drowning in time''. It is an important chance to buy
future peace in the prisons so the job of first governor becomes an
onerous responsibility.
At the other end of the penal scale the Scottish prison system has
been successful, despite constant attrition from tabloid journalism, in
creating an open prison system to resocialise long-term prisoners.
Dungavel, near Strathaven, is the latest addition in that field and it
is governed by Mrs Mary Wood, who took over from a man, and by her
deputy, Ms Susan Gemmill. In British terms it may be a unique double.
When the new specialised small unit comes on stream at Peterhead
Prison in April -- designed to handle a small number of difficult and
disruptive prisoners in conditions more structured than those at the
highly individualistic Shotts unit -- the boss will be another female
high-flier, Rona Kite, daughter of a famous prison governor father.
Other women are pushing forward towards the top ranks -- Mrs Edith
Chapman, deputy governor of Aberdeen Prison; Mrs Theresa Medhurst,
deputy governor of Polmont; Mrs Angela Barnshaw, deputy governor of
Shotts Unit, and Mrs Edith Chapman, a deputy governor at SPS
headquarters.
The main union, the SPOA, counts 314 women members, a number of whom
are now appearing in the senior ranks. It all begs the question whether
the time has come for a major breakthrough in a highly traditional and
male-dominated field. The very largest prisons, those with the highest
security and the largest concentrations of serious criminals, remain in
the hands of men.
Is their ''glass ceiling'', actual or psychological? Mr Edward
Frizzell, the chief executive of the SPS, believes there is not.
''There is no glass ceiling. I look forward to the day when we have a
woman on the prisons' board as a full executive member. As far as I am
concerned there is nothing to stop a woman rising right to the top of
this service. First they have to be in a position to apply for top jobs
and that is now happening.
Mr Frizzell is all for more female involvement in prison management.
He says there is a lot of evidence that women are a moderating influence
in jails; that women bring a different dimension to the handling of
conflict.
Others are not so sure about the increasing role of women in the
service, fearing that the pendulum of positive discrimination, conscious
or otherwise, may be swinging too far.
Mr Bill Stephens, the prison officers' union chairman who has spent 30
years working in jails, says: ''I think there have to be some
reservations about women governors of all-male jails, purely on
practical grounds. I do not think females should be exposed to the sort
of things, brutality and violence, for example, that males are subjected
to in this job from time to time.''

Ros Davidson reports how San Francisco has a strident new voice with a
radio station which wages war against everything 'liberal'
THE revenge of America's ''angry white men'' has been escalating for
months. But the trend has reached a disturbing new pitch in San
Francisco, where a radio station is making national news with America's
most right-wing chat shows.
Do people with Aids need to be quarantined? Should citizens be paid a
bounty to shoot illegal aliens? Should the power of the judiciary be
dismantled? Is President Clinton in the pockets of a coven of lesbian
communists at the Trilateral Commission? These are topics aired on Hot
Talk KSFO-AM since changing its format on January 1 to extremism to
attract listeners. The audience is reportedly increasing, although no
formal figures are yet available.
In San Francisco, traditionally the most liberal US city, appalled
politicians and activists are rallying opposition. Local syndicated
columnist Herb Caen, considered the city's voice, even suggested that
KSFO now means Keep Shoveling Fascist Ordure.
County officials are investigating the station for possibly breaking
civil rights laws. In America, talk is largely protected by
constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech. Even so, on Wednesday
the most incendiary host, J Paul Emerson, was fired for an undisclosed
reason two days after appearing on national TV's Phil Donahue Show.
Still, shows like The Savage Nation during afternoon rush hour are
still heard through open windows on the streets of San Francisco. Host
Michael Savage, who calls himself the Compassionate Conservative,
recently blasted: ''These gay and lesbian Nazis, I don't know what else
to call them, they're stealing our freedom!''
The sound of guns and tanks accompanies his return from commercial
breaks. ''We have such a weak, stupid people,'' he shrieked. Moments
later, he suggested lynching Colin Ferguson, the Jamaican accused of
shooting 17 people dead on the New York subway and who is representing
himself in court. ''In a sane country, people would break down the doors
of the jail and shoot this man!''
After Savage loudly asserted that America's greatest threat is the
quashing of free thinking, a man with an indistinguishable foreign
accent called: ''We succeeded where Hitler failed! We got rid of the
Jews!'' Savage's response seemed sympathetic: ''Oh woah! You're
confused. You're trying to make a point, but you're not doing it well.''
KSFO's format takes right-wing radio to a new extreme, but across the
country talk radio is increasingly drawing listeners who vent anger
against the government, women, minorities, gays, intellectuals and the
media, which they see as a liberal elite.
Arch-conservative Rush Limbaugh, syndicated nationally, claims 20
million listeners daily.
But nowhere more than San Francisco does the right-wing feel more
excluded. The area is also home of the two conservatives behind
America's first major attempt to dismantle affirmative action, job
hiring that favours minorities and women. They want the issue put to
popular vote next year.
''You're listening to the new voice of the city,'' announced KSFO's
Savage recently, ''the clear spring of reality of the city, not the
river of pollution that's run through here for 40 years.''
He has quoted excerpts from Plato's Republic and a book entitled Big
Sister is Watching, which claims conspiracies between the Trilateral
Commission and ''Hillary's hellcats''.
One recent guest was lawyer Laura Ingraham, formerly a clerk for
Justice Clarence Thomas and identified by the New York Times as part of
the new, young, conservative-opinion elite in Washington DC. Her only
hesitation over the idea of US troops protecting the Mexican border was
that it might seem Soviet.
Responded Savage: ''That's beautiful! Why don't you come out here and
run for governor?'' Minutes later a listener called on a car phone: ''I
make a nice income, a couple of hundred thousand a year, and I see that
what's happening is my money takes care of every Mexican or Chinese that
comes in. What the hell's going on here?''
''Talk radio is a venting mechanism for people who are angry and
anti-institution,'' says Cliff Zukin of Rutgers University.
Conservatives listen to talk radio more, are more likely to call in,
and more likely to get on the air. Exit polls after the last
presidential election showed that frequent listeners voted Republican 3
to 1.
''KSFO is breaking new ground in offensive programming,'' says Peter
Laufer, author of the forthcoming book Inside Talk Radio: America's
Voice or Just Hot Air? ''It's not just in poor taste, it's an
inappropriate use of the medium. These are rabble-rousers who are
preying on the public's fears for the sake of their wallet.''
On St Valentine's Day, most callers to Savage's show on the subject of
office romance were angry men. One said problems would be solved ''if
you only date mature girls''. Another stated: ''You can't have sexual
harassment laws and office romance!'' A few days earlier, Emerson had
shouted: ''Political correctness is over!''
He suggested to one caller named Lloyd: ''Everyone who's a taxpayer
and an American can be a bounty hunter, can go out there and shoot
illegal immigrants who come across the border, and can shoot killers,
robbers and rapers and drag them down to the police station and collect
a reward. No, wait, maybe that's too bad . . .''
The caller interrupted: ''Let's shoot them before they come across the
border! We don't want funeral expenses!'' Emerson laughed: ''You are
bad, Lloyd, you are stinking bad.''

If devolution is offered as the bright hope for Northern Ireland why
is it being denied to Scotland? Robbie Dinwoodie examines how the
'Belfast question' is set to haunt John Major
AS A journalist colleague from Ireland put it yesterday, after a brief
dialogue about the parallels between the new parliament proposed in
Belfast and the one being denied to Scots in Edinburgh: ''So what you're
saying is that John Major has opened a can of haggis here?''
Oh yes, as the Prime Minister might say, a not inconsiderably large
can. Mr Major's inability to have it both ways will be laid bare when he
visits Scotland today. He will face a barrage of questions about
constitutional change, focusing on inconsistencies between Scotland and
Ulster which can no longer be side-stepped.
Even his closest political allies in the Scottish media have turned
against him, with the strongly pro-Conservative, pro-Union Daily Mail
and Daily Express looking to call his bluff on the constitutional
anomalies. These newspapers, which are usually the most ''loyalist'', to
borrow a tag from across the Irish Sea, are now beginning to ask awkward
questions about the union.
''Why no similar deal for Scotland?'' asked the tartan edition of the
Mail. ''Status quo is no option for Scots,'' argued the kilted version
of the Express. When such true red, white and blue Unionist organs as
these begin to question perceived constitutional wisdom, it is clear
something is stirring.
The process by which Mr Major began painting himself into this corner
was immediately apparent as the framework document was unveiled at the
Balmoral Conference Centre in Belfast. The media had more than an hour
to consider the paperwork before the stage-managed arrival of the two
Premiers. It was immediately clear that the biggest hostage to political
fortune was paragraph 11 of the new framework agreement for Ireland,
which said: ''In Northern Ireland, unlike the situation which prevails
elsewhere throughout both islands, there is a fundamental absence of
consensus about constitutional issues.''
One might have thought that there prevailed in this part of this
island a ''fundamental absence of consensus about constitutional
issues,'' in that an overwhelming majority of Scots wish for change of
some kind, while a consistent figure of perhaps 20% are in favour of the
status quo.
This newspaper's correspondent found himself in a dilemma during the
launch of the framework documents in Belfast. Among several hundred
journalists from all over the world, the odds of catching the Prime
Minister's eye were slim. If a chance for a question arose, what should
be asked? The Scottish parallel jostled mightily for attention, but
there was another key question about the extent of any Unionist veto
within the proposed all-Ireland body.
The chance came, no-one else had asked the veto question, so that
seemed the most vital issue to broach. With the Irish ceasefire hanging
in the balance, and a permanent end to armed conflict as the prize, it
could have felt insensitive, even parochial, to push the Scottish
question at this time. Mr Major duly conceded that although the term
seemed harsh a Unionist veto did indeed exist.
But afterwards, Irish reporters from north and south, as well as
English journalists, expressed interest in the Belfast-Edinburgh
parallel. Several said it would have been an interesting issue to
explore, particularly in the light of Labour proposals for English
devolution. The chance had gone for the moment. Today, however, the
issue cannot be ducked. If Mr Major attempts to avoid the question he
will be ridiculous. If he waffles around it he will be disingenuous.
When Secretary of State Ian Lang was pressed on the Scottish-Ulster
parallel by Jonathan Dimbleby on television a fortnight ago he retreated
into the argument that Northern Ireland was being given an authority of
local government proportions, filling a void left by the neutering of
councils in the six counties. But the Prime Minister this week painted a
picture of something far more powerful than a mere local authority. He
described the proposed 90-member parliament, which would presumably meet
at Stormont, in strong terms. ''The Assembly would discharge legislative
and executive responsibilities across Northern Ireland,'' he said.
He described a new Stormont which could legislate for almost every
aspect of life in the north of Ireland. ''I believe that our proposals
should reflect the Province's unique character,'' he said. ''An Assembly
with significant powers where responsibility was shared fairly between
the parties, would help to heal divisions.''
This image of a powerful legislature reflecting specific needs clashes
with Mr Lang's suggestion of a glorified town council. In an interview
with The Herald last month, Mr Lang staunchly defended the status quo
and rebuffed any suggestion of a need for constitutional change. In a
phrase which may come back to haunt him now that the details of a
revived Stormont have been unveiled, he said: ''Simplistic comparisons
with the constitutions of other countries go nowhere at all towards
answering the question.''
He was talking primarily in terms of the federal or devolutionist
solutions found by countries such as Germany and Spain, but the example
of Northern Ireland so much closer to home may be most pertinent.
Mr Lang rejected for Scotland the devolutionary model now envisaged
for Northern Ireland. Referring to a federal solution, he said: ''I
believe it is wrong. I believe it is unwanted, I believe it is
irrelevant.''
But on devolution he went further saying it is ''not a coherent and
credible alternative form of government for Scotland within a unitary
system. It is ersatz, it is bogus, and ultimately it is unviable, and
therefore it is only one remove from separation.''
Mr Major today and Mr Lang at every juncture between now and the next
General Election is going to face questions about why devolution is
ersatz and bogus and unviable for Scotland, when devolution is the key
to a bright and shining future for Northern Ireland.
The Daily Express yesterday placed its story about the Prime Minister
sparking a devolution row on a page about the Irish dimension which
carried at the top the phrase ''We don't need guns or Semtex''. The
biggest question confronting Mr Major as he seeks his place in the
history books as the Premier who solved the Irish question, will be the
accusation that Scotland must be forced to endure the status quo simply
because it sticks with the ballot box and resisted the temptation of the
Armalite.

Air Traffic Control is a candidate for privatisation but such a move
will encounter fierce opposition from Labour and the unions, and may
fall foul of international law, as Anne Johnstone discovers
THROUGH his radar screen at the Prestwick Service Control Centre,
Dougie Maclean can ''see'' hundreds of miles out into the Atlantic.
During the day he guides the big jets from Europe as they head west
towards America. At night he shepherds them back. The life of every
passenger is in his hands.
But like the rest of Scotland's 280 air traffic controllers, he has a
lot on his mind. In the wake of its reverse on Post Office
privatisation, the Government seems more determined than ever to sell
off control of our air space.
Their reasons for doing so are more than merely ideological. Britain's
air traffic controllers don't cost the Government anything, because
airlines pay for their services. Last year the National Air Traffic
Services (NATS), currently part of the Civil Aviation Authority, made a
healthy surplus. However, with European air traffic set to double in the
next decade, Britain needs to invest #600m in upgrading air traffic
control.
Most of it will go on building two, state-of-the-art, control centres,
one in Hampshire and the other at Prestwick, to replace the present
outmoded facility there. Such an investment would not help the
Government's hefty, public sector borrowing requirement. In fact, the
Government has made it clear it has no intention of paying. It would
rather cash in NATS' assets, valued at #330m.
Because of possible implications for air safety, the Tories have
prevaricated long, and often, over privatising air traffic control. But
as with the Post Office, the Conservatives argue that privatisation
would allow the service to invest in the most modern technology.
The most articulate apostles of change are the members of the Civil
Aviation Authority. Their most powerful argument is that privatisation
will separate regulation from operation. David Learmount, operations and
safety editor for the magazine Flight International, agreed: ''Although
the CAA have an excellent safety record, there is a potential conflict
of interest in their current dual role. There are a few recent air
misses which should not have happened. At the moment the CAA might be
hesitant to bring any failings out into the open but they will enjoy
exposing the sins of a privatised body.''
However, this week the debate took a new turn with a report from the
cross-party Commons Transport Committee, chaired by former Transport
Secretary Paul Channon. The report points out that this conflict of
interest could be solved more simply by appointing an independent safety
regulator. The committee also wants to know exactly why the Government
didn't opt for the alternative of converting NATS into a profit-making,
public sector company. Such status would allow NATS to borrow on the
money markets without adding another burden to the PSBR.
Several other countries, including Germany and New Zealand, operate
their air traffic control services on this basis. No country in the
world runs a privatised service.
The British privatisation plan arouses fierce opposition, not just
from the Labour Party, but also from the unions and airlines. The
British Air Transport Association, which represents 12 leading airlines,
has come out strongly against it.
The Institution of Professionals, Managers and Specialists (IPMS), the
union which represents the air traffic controllers, has concentrated on
the issue of safety. The Government say safety is not an issue but the
union argues that profit and the pursuit of dividends for investors will
create an irresistible pressure which could compromise safety.
Dougie Maclean -- who, as well as being an air traffic controller, is
UK public relations officer for the IPMS -- says the job is already
among the most stressful in the world. ''People are under more and more
stress. The CAA has recognised this by introducing stress counselling.
Last summer, in some Scottish sectors, air traffic was up some 15% on
the previous year. In spite of this NATS has managed to cut staff,
reduce delays and make a healthy surplus. What would a privatised
company do that we're not doing already.''
About 160 controllers work at the Prestwick centre. They deal with
movements of planes in the air over Scotland and out into the Atlantic.
Another 120 controllers are spread around the Scottish airports where
NATS hold contracts.
Maclean's fear is that the ''increased efficiency'' which a private
sector operator would look for is really a cipher for working air
traffic controllers harder. ''About 60% of the cost of the service is
wages, so if they're going to maximise profits they're going to cut
staff. I can't believe safety won't be affected,'' he said.
The IPMS is also worried that privatisation will impede plans for a
single air traffic system throughout Europe. By the end of this year the
allocation of flight departure times will be in the hands of
Eurocontrol, a Brussels-based European agency, responsible for on-route
air traffic services. Increasing co-operation between European countries
on flight planning has been the main reason for cuts in the delays at UK
airports, delays which provoked a storm of protest in the late 1980s.
David Learmount of Flight International is convinced that fears about
safety are unjustified, however, he shares some of the unions other
fears. He also raised an interesting question so far unanswered: ''Is
this privatisation legal?''
The UN's International Civil Aviation Organisation, of which the UK is
a signed-up member, said emphatically that air traffic control services
aren't allowed to make profits. ''The CAA say there are ways round it,''
explained Learmount. ''They say the service will be more efficient so
there will be money left over for dividends. If this isn't
profit-making, what is?''

PRIVATE shareholders in a collapsed Glasgow-based motor insurers
agreed yesterday to form an action group to try to recover their money
through the courts.
They have enlisted the help of Mr Tom Benyon, a former Tory MP who
championed the cause of some Lloyd's names. He said after a meeting of
shareholders in Glasgow yesterday: ''I am confident that they are going
to make a recovery. We are going for total recovery plus interest.''
The Diamond Group breakdown insurance company crashed in October 1989,
just six months after its high-profile #4.4m flotation.
Mr Benyon, director of the Society of Names, was the founder of the
Gooda Walker Action Group which recently secured an interim offer of
#210m on behalf of 3500 investors at Lloyd's.
He was approached by some Diamond Group shareholders to take up their
case, and yesterday's meeting resulted in the formation of the Diamond
Action Group.
Later, he said there was ''overwhelming support'' for the pursuit of a
court action. As well as those who had attended the meeting, many others
had been in contact with him. The majority of the 400 private
shareholders were already ''on board''.
They will be pursuing an action jointly with Postel, managers of the
Post Office and BT pension fund.
Postel, a major shareholder, is suing Mr Derek Diamond and Mr Clive
Miller, directors of the Diamond Group, and the group's professional
advisers at the time of its launch on the unlisted securities market.
Glasgow-based Allied Provincial Securities Ltd and accountants Arthur
Andersen are among the parties being sued for alleged negligence in
connection with the collapse.
Mr Benyon said yesterday: ''It is clear that between April 1989, when
the company was launched to the public, and October 1989, the dragon's
teeth of disaster were already sown.
''By that, I mean that what made the company go bust in October should
have been known at the time of the flotation.''
He added that he expected the action to come to court, in the Chancery
Division of the High Court in London, within 18 months.
Mr Benyon could not say what the costs of pursuing the action would be
for each private shareholder, but added: ''It will be relatively modest
and at a level which should encourage them to join the action.''

A WIDOW whose Victorian mansion is on the verge of toppling over a
crumbling cliff edge is defiantly staying on in her home despite
warnings that it could disappear at any moment.
Experts have told Mrs Diana Stuckey that her home at Niton, Isle of
Wight, could tumble 150ft on to the beach below.
But the mother of five, who has lived there for 35 years, says she
will stay as long as she can. ''I'm aware of the dangers, but this is my
home with many cherished memories, and is the place where I raised my
children.''
When she moved there with her late husband in 1960, Reeth Lodge, which
stands on the island's southern coast, had tennis courts and a croquet
lawn. It was built and extended in the 19th century and Victorian Poet
Laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson stayed there with friends.
Most of the former grounds have disappeared over the cliff and the
house, which is now uninsurable, rests just 15ft from the edge.
''Heavy rains in recent weeks have caused a lot of extra slippage and
made things very precarious. The main danger is the cracking which
threatens to collapse the building from below,'' Mrs Stuckey said.
''The council have advised me to move out, but I just can't bring
myself to do it.''
Mr Robin McInnes, surveyor for South Wight Borough Council, said only
an extended period of dry weather would give the house a chance.
Occupants of a nearby holiday bungalow have moved out, but Mrs Stuckey
stands defiant. ''I have been moving many of the belongings out, but I
plan to stay here as long as I can. It's my home after all,'' she said.

A JEWELLER has offered a reward of #10,000 for the conviction of armed
raiders who robbed one of his shops of more than #100,000 worth of
watches.
It was Scotland's biggest armed jewellery robbery, according to Mr
Michael Laing.
The raid in Edinburgh was also the first armed robbery the family
business of Laing the Jeweller, which has two shops in Glasgow and one
in Antwerp, has experienced since it was founded in 1840.
Mr Laing said he believed the two culprits were professionals, who
would strike again if they were not caught.
Two women members of staff at the Frederick Street shop were
threatened during Wednesday's robbery.
The raiders escaped in a stolen, red Citroen AX Debut, before
abandoning the car in Young Street South Lane.
''They were a very professional outfit who will strike again if they
are not stopped. Someone could be killed,'' Mr Laing said.
The robbers were aged 30 to 35, 5ft 8ins to 5ft 10ins. One had a
shotgun, the other a crowbar.
Police have appealed for witnesses. They would like to hear from the
driver of a car overtaken at high speed in Hill Street by the getaway
car.

THREE High Court judges yesterday shattered any hope that Robert Black
might still have had of one more attempt to appeal against his
conviction for the murder and abduction of young girls.
Delivering their reasons in London for refusing the Scots-born child
killer and paedophile leave to appeal against his conviction at
Newcastle Crown Court last year, Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice,
said the summing up of the trial judge had been a model of clarity and
conciseness, well-balanced and fair.
Black, given 10 life sentences with a recommendation that he serve at
least 35 years for offences which included the kidnappings and murders
of Susan Maxwell, 11, Caroline Hogg, five, and Sarah Harper, 10, was not
in court.
Before the trial Mr Justice Macpherson of Cluny had ruled that details
of the kidnapping and sexual assault of a young girl at Stow -- an
offence Black had pled guilty to at the High Court in Edinburgh --
should go before the jury.
He had ruled that it bore a ''hallmark'' or ''signature'' replicated
in each of the offences on which Black was accused.
On Monday, during the application for leave to appeal, Mr Ronald
Thwaites, QC, for Black, had insisted there was no such common hallmark.
The trial judge, he argued, had not sufficiently considered
dissimilarities in the cases.
Yesterday Lord Taylor, sitting with Mr Justice Ognall and Mrs Justice
Steele, said the decision to admit the Stow incident could not be
faulted.
''The similarities were striking, indeed. To pick only two, the
transport of the victims so many miles to the south and in the case of
the three deceased to the 'Midlands Triangle' and the removal of the
shoes were unusual and strikingly similar features.''
In addition, the trial judge in his summing-up had clearly rehearsed
with the jury features that showed dissimilarities.
The three judges concluded that directions to the jury by the trial
judge could not properly be criticised.
Pointing out that Mr Justice Macpherson's summing-up had taken up only
one day of a six-week trial, they said he had rightly been ''at pains to
assist rather than oppress the jury by paring down his review of the
evidence to what he regarded as the essential.''

A HOSPITAL trust has received a dressing down from a health union for
wanting to spend up to #30,000 on new uniforms.
The union believes that, if Inverness's Raigmore Hospital Health Trust
has any spare cash, it should be spent on patient care.
A Unison spokesman said yesterday that the trust could buy half a
dozen vital monitoring machines or more telephone trolleys for patients
with the cash.
The union said that the trust could also tackle their biggest
complaint from visitors -- the lack of car parking. It claims the cash
could add an additional 100 parking spaces.
However, managers said that the uniform would boost the trust's
corporate image and they have already met staff to discuss uniforms for
non-medical administrative, secretarial, and finance workers.
The union spokesman said: ''The trust's timing is dreadful . . .
coming at a time when nurses across the country are considering strike
action over pay.
''I would also question their purse-keeping ability, if the trust have
to spend this money before the end of the financial year. We have had a
frustrating year, being told there is no money, available and now there
seems to be a surplus.''
The trust has been under fire constantly for cut-backs with fewer beds
available at weekends, wards closing, and new mothers being told to
provide their own nappies.
However, a trust spokesman maintained that staff had reacted
favourably to the plans.

HEALTH authorities were yesterday instructed to review services to
ensure chronically ill people who need long-term care receive it.
The order from Ministers came as new guidelines were launched aimed at
ending the controversy over the decline in continuing care.
Announcing the moves, Health Minister John Bowis said he expected some
health authorities to re-invest in some services.
Yesterday's guidance also sets out plans for an independent appeals
system for families faced with devastating nursing bills for disabled
relatives. Instructions are also given on when health authorities should
pay for long-term care.
But doctors' leaders immediately condemned the guidance and called for
national standards of care.
They warned that long-term losers would be friends and families who
acted as carers and would have to bear the financial burden.
Similar guidance to the DoH's circular is expected to be issued
shortly in Scotland, said a Scottish Office spokesman.
''The DoH guidance is similar in intent to the existing position here
but goes into more detail,'' he added.
Dr Mac Armstrong, secretary of the British Medical Association, said:
''This guidance clearly signals the end of the welfare state providing
free care from the cradle to the grave.''
The guidelines do not lay down the exact circumstances in which
long-stay patients should be discharged to nursing homes.
There is also a new power for hospitals to discharge in-patients who
do not want to go into nursing homes.
Until now patients have had a right to say ''no'' to residential care
and remain in hospital. That is now removed.
Under the guidance, patients cannot be forced into residential care --
but they can be moved back to their homes backed up by a package of care
arranged by health and social services.
It would be at this point that a person needing long-term care might
face charges from social services for their input to his or her care.
Unveiling the guidance at a Westminster news conference, Mr Bowis said
it reinforced the health service's continuing care responsibilities.
He said: ''NHS responsibility for health care really does continue to
run from the cradle to the grave.''
But Dr Armstrong said: ''Shifting the emphasis for care from the NHS
to social services simply means that many long-term patients will face
means-tested care in the community instead of free NHS care.
''No-one would argue that that the NHS has unlimited resources but
this guidance only confuses the grey area between health care and social
services.
''Furthermore, it fails to address the financial implications for many
people unprepared for this significant change in social policy.''
The guidance calls for draft local policies and eligibility criteria
for continuing health care to be ready by the end of September.
These should be made publicly available for consultation and be in
place by April 1996.
The guidelines are an attempt to clarify the NHS's responsibilities --
but may spell more confusion.
For the first time, health authorities and GP fundholders are told
they must fund specialist medical and nursing assessment, rehabiliation
and recovery, palliative health care and respite care.
They must also continue to foot the bill for in-patient care under
specialist supervision, community health services, specialist support to
people in residential care, specialist transport services and primary
care.
However, at the heart is the replacement of a 1989 Health Department
circular which spelled out patients' right to refuse to be discharged
from NHS care into a nursing or residential home.

A 34-year-old man was charged last night with the murders of
seven-year-old Jonathan Copley and his teenage babysitter Rachel Rooney.
Mr Tariq Rehman, the boyfriend of Rachel's mother, will appear before
Bradford City Magistrates this morning.
He was arrested on Wednesday evening by detectives investigating the
double killings in Little Horton, Bradford, early on Sunday.
Mr Rehman, an insurance company manager, lived with Rachel's mother
Christina and her teenage son and daughters in a four-bedroomed detached
house at Adwalton Grove, Queensbury, Bradford.
Rachel, 15, and Jonathan were found stabbed to death at the Copleys'
terraced house in Southfield Lane by Jonathan's mother Denise.
Mrs Copley had been to a party, leaving Rachel in charge of Jonathan
for the first time.

THE ARCHDIOCESE of Glasgow yesterday announced it will invest part of
the proceeds from a #3.5m land deal in redeveloping the East End should
it be granted planning consent for a site it plans to sell.
The Catholic Church wants to sell the land, in Dalbeath, to retailers
B &amp; Q. An application by the Archdiocese, which is #6m in the red, for
retail planning permission will be considered on February 28 by Glasgow
District Council.
An Archdiocese statement last night indicated that developers, the
Walker Group, have been appointed for the project. The Church has also
entered into partnership with the Glasgow Development Agency, which owns
land neighbouring the Dalbeath site.
Cardinal Thomas Winning has stipulated that the development has to be
of direct benefit to the East End and as part of the deal appointing the
Walker Group the company had to agree to use some of their development
profit to provide industrial units in the Cambuslang Investment Park.
The Cardinal explained his rationale by saying: ''The Archdiocese will
benefit greatly from a planning consent granted by Glasgow District
Council. However, the Church's dealings must be on a different value
base from the private market.''
Consequently, he pledged the Archdiocese will look seriously at
releasing land in London Road for housing development by the Tollcross
Housing Association, and would also build a community hall in the area's
St Joseph's Parish.
In addition, he promised to upgrade church-owned land in Bridgeton and
Shettleston, and start a major renovation of the 130-year-old St Peter's
Cemetery in Dalbeath should the consent be granted.

A PLEA was made yesterday on behalf of a unique charity through which
police in Edinburgh have helped the city's poor since the Victorian era.
It was voiced by a former inspector in the Lothian and Borders force,
Mr Hugh Robertson, who has been secretary of the Edinburgh Police-Aided
Clothing Scheme for 20 years.
Mr Robertson, who retires today from his civilian post as custodier of
the force's stolen property unit and is also stepping down from his work
with the fund, made a parting appeal for more public support.
The scheme originally provided boots and clothing to deprived
children, selected by beat bobbies. It continues to help poor families
by supplying footwear and clothing for youngsters as well as financial
help to elderly people who are having difficulty paying fuel bills.
However, a drop in donations has meant it has had to meet around half
the cost from its reserves.

THE Royal Bank of Scotland has made #50,000 by selling #1 notes for
#2.50 each, it was revealed yesterday.
The bank has sold 20,000 #1 notes in commemorative packs to mark the
100th anniversary of the death of Scottish writer Robert Louis
Stevenson.
Demand has been so great across Britain that the bank is to make up
another 5000 packs.
Unlike other British banks, the Royal Bank continues to issue #1 notes
and printed two million to commemorate the death in 1894 of the author
of Treasure Island and Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.
It then produced 20,000 collectors' packs containing a #1 note,
specially printed envelope, and card bearing an issue number. Each of
the 350 branches in England and 350 in Scotland have now sold all their
packs.
It is the second time the Royal Bank has printed commemorative #1
notes and sold them for #2.50. In December 1992, it produced a #1 note
to celebrate the European summit in Edinburgh.
The bank spokesman added: ''Those notes were also very popular and I
am told are now changing hands at up to #4.50 each.''

ROSEMARY West will stand trial at Winchester Crown Court, a judge
ruled yesterday.
Mr Justice Mantell, senior presiding judge of the Western Circuit,
provisionally set the start of the trial for October 3, and indicated he
might be the judge.
He announced his decision at a hearing in Bristol Crown Court when he
heard applications for the venue from the prosecution and defence
counsel.
Mrs West, 41, faces 10 charges of murder. Her alleged victims include
her daughter, Heather, 16, and stepdaughter, eight-year-old Charmaine.
She also faces charges of rape and indecent assaults involving two
women.
Last Tuesday, Mrs West, a mother of seven, of Cromwell Street,
Gloucester, was formally committed for trial after a seven-day hearing
at Dursley, Gloucestershire, before Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary
Magistrate Peter Badge.
She was not at yesterday's hearing.
Mr Neil Butterfield, QC, made a brief application for the Crown and
Miss Sasha Wass appeared for Mrs West.
The murder charges relate to the discovery of nine sets of human
remains in the house and garden at Mrs West's home in Gloucester.
Mrs West's husband, Fred, 53, was found hanged in his cell on New
Year's day at Winson Green Prison, Birmingham, where he was being held
on remand on 12 murder charges.
Meanwhile, his brother, Mr John Charles Edward West, 52, of
Gloucester, was committed for trial to Gloucester Crown Court, charged
with raping two girls between January 1, 1975, and January 1, 1980. He
was allowed conditional bail pending his trial.

ECSTASY tablets with a street value of up to #300,000 were shipped
with cucumbers to Glasgow, a court heard yesterday.
Almost 15,000 tablets and $24,000 were found in a box sent from the
Netherlands delivered to a Glasgow frozen food store.
Customs and Excise officers and police swooped on Glasgow businessman
Mr Kan Yiu Tong, 41, as he drove off with the box.
Mr Tong, of Birchlea Drive, Giffnock, denies at the High Court in
Glasgow smuggling the drugs into Scotland.
He has lodged a special defence naming a man from Oban as the alleged
smuggler.
The court has heard how Mr Tong exported frozen prawns and imported
vegetables using Zwetsloot Flowers and Plants, of Kinrossie, Perthshire,
to carry his goods on their twice-weekly run to Holland.
But last October Mr Michiel Zwetsloot, 35, and his driver, Mr Gavin
Morrison, 25, opened a ''suspicious looking'' box.
Inside was another box and a carrier bag containing the dollars and
drugs. They called police.
Mr Morrison, of Guildtown, by Perth, said the contents of the box were
substituted before he delivered it to L &amp; T Frozen Foods, in Byron
Street, Partick, Glasgow.
The firm's owner, Mr Peter Leung, 32, said he helped unload the box.
Mr Tong owed him #15,000, and gave him #4000 cash and a post-dated
cheque for the other #11,000, he said.
Mr Leung alleged Mr Tong told him in Cantonese: ''There are 100,000 US
dollars inside, do you want to see them? I said: 'No'.''
Customs investigator Lewis Clark, 37, agreed with defence advocate
William Dunlop that a parcel containing $50,000 had been sent a year ago
to the Oban man named in the special defence.
Mr Clark said the parcel of money had been described as holding
documents, but as no link to drug money could be proved, it was
delivered to the man.
He said it had been addressed to the man's lawyer in Oban.
Mr Dunlop said: ''Are you aware there is a warrant in the US for this
man in connection with drug trafficking?''
Mr Clark said he had checked the claim, but was told there was no
warrant for the man.
The trial before Lord Johnston and a jury continues.

Algiers, Thursday
ALGERIAN Muslim fundamentalist rebels said security forces
''massacred'' up to 200 prisoners in what authorities called a thwarted
escape bid from an Algiers prison.
The exiled leadership of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front said
more than 100 prisoners were killed at the Sekadji prison yesterday.
Anwar Haddam, head of the Washington-based FIS Parliamentary
Delegation, said in a separate statement which gave conflicting figures
that security forces killed 200 in a ''deliberate massacre of political
prisoners'' at the central Algiers top security jail.
There was no official confirmation of the death toll. Algerian
authorities have admitted that security forces killed mutineers after
they slit the throats of four warders.
Haddam said: ''The massacre, which has left around 200 victims,
follows other massacres in similar circumstances beginning with
Berouaghia prison in November which left more than 500 prisoners dead.''
Sekadji prison, surrounded by high walls with guard towers, lies near
the Defence Ministry, on the heights of the Casbah, the ancient centre
of Algiers. It was holding scores of Muslim fundamentalists, many of
whom on death row.--Reuter.

Geneva, Thursday
AMERICAN diver Greg Louganis was under no obligation to declare that
he was HIV-positive before competing in the Seoul Olympics, a senior
Olympic official said today.
Reacting to the news that the greatest diver in Olympic history had
developed Aids, Francois Carrard, director-general of the International
Olympic Committee, dismissed as ''far-fetched'' the idea that
competitors in Seoul could have been infected.
''The first feeling we have to have for this man is one of sympathy.
All public figures who disclose that they have Aids contribute to the
battle against the disease,'' he said.
Louganis hit his head badly on the board during the preliminaries for
the diving competition and bled into the pool. He received five stitches
from a doctor who was not wearing protective gloves.
Carrard said the advice he had received from IOC medical experts was
that there was a ''very, very low'' risk of infection since diving was
not a contact sport. He thought there was no point in testing other
competitors from Seoul.
''If it was a boxing match with blood all over the place and
competitors falling over each other, it might be different. In this case
there was no contact,'' he said.
Louganis, 35, the first man to win consecutive Olympic springboard
diving titles, has disclosed that he knew he was HIV-positive when he
competed in Seoul and that he now has Aids.
''There was certainly no obligation for Louganis to report any
disease. Athletes were not under any obligation to report any disease
spontaneously,'' said Carrard.
His comments contrasted sharply with those of the chief organiser of
the Seoul Games, who said it was ''really regrettable'' Louganis had
competed while knowing he was infected by the Aids virus.
''It is not morally right, particularly because he was injured and
bled,'' said Park Seh-jik, who headed the Seoul Olympic Organising
Committee.
In Brussels, IOC medical commission chairman Prince Alexandre de
Merode said the IOC was unlikely to order HIV tests and added that he
did not think the virus could have been transmitted.
Louganis, who announced last year that he is homosexual, is the latest
in a series of well-known sporting figures to have been infected with
the HIV virus. The most famous is former basketball star Magic
Johnson.--Reuter.

Cherbourg, Thursday
A BRITISH ship carrying re-processed nuclear fuel left for Japan by a
secret route today after French sailors prevented anti-nuclear
protesters from blocking the shipment.
The Pacific Pintail left the Channel port of Cherbourg escorted by
four French naval vessels and commandos in six rubber dinghies.
The environmental group Greenpeace, which has vowed to shadow the
Pacific Pintail along its route, tried to prevent it from entering
Cherbourg. However a navy tug rammed the Greenpeace ship Moby Dick and
commandos stormed aboard.
''Naval commandos boarded the protest vessel, cut its anchor line, and
towed it out of the inner port of Cherbourg,'' said Greenpeace.
A navy spokesman said 20 protesters were intercepted as they sailed
three rubber dinghies towards the Pacific Pintail but there was no
violence. ''It was all very calm. These are non-violent people,'' he
said.
The Cherbourg protesters were taken to navy headquarters for
questioning. A court had earlier barred members of Greenpeace from
approaching the Pacific Pintail, warning them they would be fined
#39,000.
British Nuclear Fuels, whose unit Pacific Nuclear Transport Ltd had
sought the court ruling, said it would ''definitely seek to have the
terms of the ruling enforced''.
Greenpeace said it had managed to delay the Pacific Pintail by 30
minutes.
However Jean-Louis Ricaud, head of re-processing at the French
state-run nuclear power company Cogema, said the Pacific Pintail loaded
the 14-tonne cargo in under four hours -- ''slightly less time than we
had expected''.
Greenpeace describes the Pacific Pintail as a ''nuclear garbage
barge'' and says a fire on board or collision could release the waste.
The environment group plans to shadow the Pacific Pintail on its
voyage to Japan, due to last up to two months.
Ricaud indicated that the Greenpeace ship due to follow the cargo, the
Solo, may be tracked by the French and then the British navies.
Japan, with no reprocessing facilities of its own, sends spent fuel to
Europe to be turned into fuel-grade plutonium.
The Pacific Pintail shipment will be the first of up to 90 to Japan in
the coming decade after reprocessing by Cogema.
In Japan, anti-nuclear activists also protested against the shipment,
echoing those in France and other countries who condemn the secrecy with
which Tokyo has shrouded the issue.
Japan and the British shippers have refused to disclose the precise
route. Many countries have protested or banned the ship from their
waters.
The 14 tons of waste, produced from French reprocessing of spent
nuclear fuel from Japan, is mixed with molten glass, hardened into 28
blocks, and stored in a huge metal container totalling 112 tons.
More than 3000 such blocks are to be sent to Japan by the year 2010.
Environmentalists say exposure to one block from one yard for one minute
can be lethal.--Reuter.

Islamabad, Thursday
A PAKISTANI court today dismissed charges of blasphemy against a
Christian teenager, who had been sentenced to hang for insulting Islam.
Muslim extremists rioted outside the courthouse, which was heavily
protected by riot police armed with assault weapons. Police dispersed
the mob, which smashed traffic lights and tried to blockade streets.
Salamat Masih, 14, and his uncle, Rehmat Masih, were convicted of
scrawling anti-Islamic graffiti on a mosque wall, a crime that carries a
mandatory death penalty in Pakistan.
In a written judgment, two Lahore High Court Justices dismissed the
blasphemy charges, saying there was no evidence.
The offending slogans were immediately rubbed off the wall and
witnesses refused to repeat them in court, saying they were too
offensive.
Militant Muslims railed against the judgment, threatening to take
revenge and stage demonstrations tomorrow.
''We will do everything to protest against the judgement, not only
will we come out on the streets, but we will also take extreme steps,''
said Hafiz Ahmed Baksh, secretary general of the militant Sunni Muslim
group known as the Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet.
Earlier, prosecution lawyer Rashid Murtaza Qureshi stormed out of the
courthouse, shouting: ''This is a kangaroo court.'' He criticised the
judges and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
Extremists have threatened to kill the judges and lawyers, vowed to
kill Salamat and his uncle if they are set free, and shouted ''death to
Bhutto''.
Defence lawyer Hina Jilani said she feared for her clients' safety.
''Their security is at risk,'' she said. ''It is a very serious, a
very dangerous situation.''
She applauded the court decision but said immediate security
arrangements had to be made for her Christian clients while they were
still in jail.
''We have already alerted the authorities and they have assured us
that they will protect them,'' she said.
As the Islamic sabbath begins tomorrow, Jilani said it was unlikely
her clients would be freed until Sunday.
After that she said she would like to see them moved, either in
Pakistan or granted asylum elsewhere.
Human rights organisations have criticised Pakistan for its vaguely
worded blasphemy laws introduced in the 1980s by military dictator
General Muhammed Zia-ul Haq.
In London, Amnesty International said: ''The abuse of Pakistan's
blasphemy laws can occur because of the lack of adequate legal
safeguards.''
Tonight the World Council of Churches welcomed the acquittal.
Spokesman John Newbury said it hoped that Pakistan would change its laws
so that similar cases would not arise and ''to prevent abuse of the law
by those who might have personal grievances against Christians''.
Ms Bhutto has refused to repeal the laws despite intense lobbying,
including by the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. So far
she has been unable to introduce even minor amendments to the laws.
The furore around the case has underlined her difficulties in trying
to curb the rise of fundamentalism in her country.
Islamic clerics threatened to launch nationwide protests after she
expressed shock at the death penalty given a juvenile. Some of the most
extreme Islamists suggested she too should be tried for blasphemy.
Six people have been sentenced to death under the laws, although no
hanging has yet been carried out.--AP/Reuter.

Cape Town, Thursday
PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela's estranged wife Winnie landed in new
controversy today when she left on a foreign visit in defiance of his
wishes.
Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said that Mrs Mandela, a
deputy Minister, had left for West Africa after being told by Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki, on Mandela's instructions, to cancel the trip.
''The deputy Minister subsequently wrote to the president explaining
why it was important to proceed with the trip. The deputy Minister
departed, as scheduled, before the consultation on her resubmitted
request could be completed,'' he said.
Mankahlana told Reuters later that government rules required a
Minister to have the president's permission for any trip out of the
country.
''Mrs Mandela did not have that permission when she left,'' he said.
Mbeki told reporters earlier that Mrs Mandela was under investigation
concerning weekend newspaper allegations that she tried to use her
government position to help a friend in a legal dispute with a local
government.
''If we find there is anything that is grossly irregular, we will take
action that is commensurate with the grossness of the action,'' he said.
She has also been in the news concerning allegations of financial
impropriety by former colleagues in the women's league of her husband's
African National Congress.
Eleven members of the league, including treasurer Adelaide Tambo,
widow of respected former ANC president Oliver Tambo, resigned in
protest at her activities.
Earlier this month President Mandela demanded that she apologise for
making remarks critical of the government.
In other developments, conservative black leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi
set conditions for ending a boycott of Parliament by his Inkatha Freedom
Party, but senior government sources said President Mandela did not plan
to meet them.
Buthelezi rejected a bid by former president F W de Klerk, now one of
Mandela's two deputies in the government of national unity, to broker an
emergency summit of party leaders.
In a statement, Buthelezi laid out the terms on which he would
recommend to a Inkatha special congress next month that he should end
the parliamentary boycott launched on Tuesday.
However a government source said Mandela was impatient with Buthelezi
and would not seek a meeting with him before the Inkatha congress.
''The president really is not willing to let anyone hold the country
to ransom,'' the source said.
Speaker of Parliament Frene Ginwala said Inkatha's 43 members of the
National Assembly would lose their seats if they were absent for 15
consecutive working days, which means they must be back for budget day
on March 15.

United Nations, Thursday
US Ambassador Madeleine Albright is to visit several countries with
seats on the Security Council to make sure they do not lift the oil
embargo against Iraq.
The trip, at the request of President Bill Clinton, includes talks
with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd tomorrow. She then goes to Oman,
Prague, Rome, Argentina, and Honduras.
However US officials say she will avoid France, Russia, and China,
which have spoken in favour of easing sanctions. She is not going to
Germany because she recently spoke with Chancellor Helmut Kohl in
Washington.
Albright's spokesman, James Rubin, said the mission was intended to
''discuss the best means to ensure Iraq's full compliance with its
obligations as established by UN Security Council resolutions''.
Iraq has been under sanctions since its troops invaded Kuwait in
August 1990. Under a 1991 Gulf War ceasefire resolution, Baghdad has to
satisfy UN inspectors it has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction before sanctions on exports such as oil can be eased.
Earlier today the UN's chief arms inspector, Rolf Ekeus, left Baghdad
saying he had been unable to resolve differences over Iraq's past
biological warfare research, with no progress on germ warfare during his
four-day talks.
The United States wants to see a pattern of compliance on a host of
issues and evidently fears that as UN disarmament demands are met,
Russia will move to lift the embargo.
The US move comes as the leader of a controversial British business
mission to Baghdad said trade talks had been essential to prevent losing
in deepening competition for Iraqi markets.
Edmund Sykes of the Iraqi British Interests Group said: ''In this case
a number of British companies have indicated they are not prepared to
see this large market lost to foreign competitors because of the
political views of the Government.''--Reuter.

The bus swerved to avoid an oncoming lorry in the accident, in the

The victims were two couples in their 50s. The 59-year-old British bus

<TEXT>
A SPECIALLY-trained police officer yesterday admitted that a catalogue
of errors occurred during investigations into gang rape and sex attack
allegations against Red Dwarf actor Craig Charles.
WPC Jane Eeles, who ''chaperoned'' and cared for the hysterical woman
whom he is alleged to have abused, admitted a police doctor did not see
her until more than 24 hours after the assault ''because one was not
available''.
Southwark Crown Court also heard that, despite the need for an early
medical examination, the woman's own doctor and nurse were turned away
from her home hours after the alleged attack.
WPC Eeles said that, because of difficulties in finding a police
surgeon to see the 38-year-old former Soho dancer, she was allowed to go
home and wash away possibly vital forensic evidence.
WPC Eeles, who told the court she was highly experienced in dealing
with sex attack victims, also said that she had not taken swabs herself
from the woman, insisting it was not her job.
Mr Charles, 30, of Kennington, and Mr John Peploe, 36, of Camberwell,
both south London, deny a joint charge of rape and four joint counts of
indecent assault.
Ms Jill Evans, defending Mr Peploe, a company director, asked the
constable if she had told her superiors about alleged semen splashes on
the woman's legs.
WPC Eeles: ''Not necessarily, because it is not important at that
stage.'' Her priority, she said, was the welfare of the woman.
The alleged victim, an acquaintance of Mr Charles, told the court how
the actor and two friends called at her flat in Clapham, south London,
between 5am and 6am on July 8 last year.
She said that within minutes Mr Charles, who plays David Lister, the
last human in the universe, in the BBC2 comedy series, had encouraged
one of his friends to rape her. She also alleged she was indecently
assaulted and forced to commit indecent acts.
The trial continues.

ETHNIC minority students are five times less likely to be accepted at
St Andrews University than white students with the same A-level results,
according to a report.
It was produced by the Medical Practitioners' Union and a Labour MP,
Miss Dawn Primarolo. Their league table of discrimination by medical
schools claims 10 medical schools are twice as likely to take white
candidates, and that St Andrews' record is the worst, followed by the
Royal London Hospital.
Fifth on the list is Glasgow University (after Belfast and
Birmingham), with the union claiming white applicants are 2.39 times
more likely to be accepted than those from an ethnic minority.
Dr Sam Everington, union vice-president, said the survey was based on
data from the Universities' Central Council on Admissions and that it
had compared applicants' success based on their A-level results but not
Highers as the two systems were impossible to compare.
In general terms, the research claims that while medical schools do
not appear to discriminate against ethnic minority candidates achieving
the highest A-level scores, white applicants who achieve lower A-level
scores are twice as likely to be accepted than ethnic minority students
with the same results.
Dr Everington said the survey was part of a campaign against perceived
discrimination throughout the health service. He also claimed that the
chances of a doctor from an ethnic minority becoming a consultant were
9:1 against, compared with a white counterpart.
''This survey is symptomatic of the NHS which does not ensure it gets
the best doctors for the job,'' he said.
A spokeswoman for St Andrews University, which has a three-year
pre-clinical medical school, said: ''No evidence is given to support the
notion that the figures arrived at for St Andrews are statistically
reliable in the case of a very small pre-clinical medical school which,
because of its geographical location, does not have a catchment area in
which ethnic minority candidates are well represented.''
She added: ''The University of St Andrews is proud of an admissions
policy which is totally based on merit. It is not, however, too proud to
be constantly vigilant in relation to equal opportunity of entry.''
A spokesman for Glasgow University said that admission to the
university, particularly its medical faculty, was not based on
examination results alone but took into account a number of other
factors.
He said: ''Students are also judged by the statements they write in
support of their application.'' He pointed out that this and other
factors had not been taken into account in the report.
''The research refers to A-level results while the majority of Glasgow
undergraduates are admitted with Highers,'' he added.
''However, we have recorded the average A-level scores of those
admitted in the years in question. In 1990 and 1991, these figures show
that for home undergraduates across the university, white students were
admitted with an average of 22.5 A-level points and ethnic minorities
19.5; the following year the figures were 22.7 and 20.8 respectively.
These figures show that ethnic minorities are not given a higher A-level
hurdle.''
A report in the British Medical Journal concludes that ''people from
ethnic minority groups applying to medical school are disadvantaged,
principally because ethnic origin is assessed from a candidate's
surname'', although it adds that the disadvantage has diminished since
1986.''
The BMJ report adds: ''For subjects applying before A-level the
mechanism is that less credit is given to referees' estimates of A-level
grades. Selection would be fairer if application forms were anonymous;
forms did not include estimates of A-level grades; and selection took
place after A-level results are known.''

A MUSICIAN who grew cannabis in the engine room of a disused
lighthouse in the Highlands had sentence deferred for a year at the High
Court in Edinburgh yesterday.
Guitarist John Sutherland, whose stage name is ''Johnny Fats'', had a
judge's warning ringing in his ears as he left the dock.
Lord MacLean told him: ''If you offend again in the next year you will
be brought back to this court and I would be bound to impose a custodial
sentence.''
The judge said he was prepared to give Sutherland, a former campaigner
for the legalisation of cannabis, a chance to change his attitude to the
use of the drug.
Lord MacLean said: ''What you did was solely for your own benefit and
you did not gain financially. I appreciate you want to be able to
travel. What I am going to do is to defer sentence for one year to see
how you respond.''
Sutherland, 50, appeared at the High Court in Inverness earlier this
month where he pleaded guilty to producing cannabis at Dunnet Head
Lighthouse. He also pleaded guilty to possessing the Class B drug and
possessing it with intent to supply it. The offences took place between
January and July 1993.
The court heard that when police searched the lighthouse cottage where
Sutherland lived they found two bags of herbal cannabis and a further
search of the lighthouse engine room revealed 192 cannabis plants and
growing equipment.
The court was told that Sutherland, who admitted previous drugs
convictions, had been a cannabis user for 26 years.

FORTY new British indoor tennis centres, several in Scotland, have
roofs which are too low for major international indoor competitions.
They include a #6m project at Scotstoun, in Glasgow, and Scotland's
national centre at Craiglockhart, which is currently undergoing a #3m
revamp.
Davis Cup events and tour matches organised by the Association of
Tennis Professionals and the Women's Tennis Association require 12
metres' clearance. The new centres, built partly with funds from the
Lawn Tennis Association's Indoor Tennis Initiative, conform to the LTA
requirement, which is nine metres.
The multi-sport development at Scotstoun, which includes a swimming
pool, is due to open in April. One ATP event has already been precluded
because of the centre's dimensions and another tennis event has been
switched to the David Lloyd centre in Paisley because the Glasgow venue
is unlikely to be ready.
Craiglockhart is to host the World Cup doubles, a WTA tour event, this
summer, as part of the Scottish LTA centenary. However, if it were to
rain, under WTA rules, the indoor facilities would be inadequate.
The 40 centres, either completed or under construction, are backed by
#63m of LTA funds, effectively Wimbledon profits. Other planned centres
will bring spending to more than #100m.
Critics say such investment is folly without arenas capable of hosting
major events, adding that local authorities are unlikely to build
international centres after having spent millions on pay-and-play
facilities.
However, Mr Clive Thomson, the Glasgow-based convener of the LTA's
international tournaments and events committee, insists the association
is not courting disaster.
He said: ''There is no embarrassment whatsoever. These centres were
not designed for major internationals. Scotstoun is backed by Glasgow
City Council, the LTA, and the Scottish Sports Council for public use as
a pay-and-play centre, in the belief that it will encourage more
grass-roots participation. It was never meant as an international venue.
''It will, however, host the Great Britain v USA under-21 competition
this year. Only a very few tournaments would be precluded because of the
roof height.''
Glasgow City Council endorses that view, and points out that other
places, such as the SECC, could host a tour event.
However, former Scottish internationalist and professional coach Blane
Dodds, said: ''It's all very well bringing tennis to the masses, but
it's not enough to provide facilities. You need a shop window to inspire
and motivate. Showpiece tournaments provide that. I think its a major
mistake not to have some international facilities.''

ONE of the three men accused of killing a retired mining engineer
after a #185,000 bank robbery, yesterday admitted that ''without a
shadow of doubt'' his gun fired the fatal shot.
However, Mr Robert Smith told the High Court in Edinburgh that the
shooting was not intentional and that he did not know someone had died
until after his arrest.
Questioned by Mr Donald Findlay, QC, Mr Smith denied that he was a
liar and that his claim not to know how Mr David Dunn, 63, had died was
a despicable cock and bull story.
Mr Smith, 33, a lance-corporal in the Household Cavalry, Mr Gerald
McQuade, 40, and Mr Paul Bootland, 25, all deny murdering Mr Dunn in
Bonnyrigg, Midlothian, on October 19 last year.
They also deny attempting to murder an off-duty policeman and two
members of the public.
All three are also charged with robbing the Bank of Scotland in High
Street, Bonnyrigg, on the same day.
Mr Smith, who told the court he went on the run from the army after
his return from service in the Gulf War, accepted yesterday that he must
have been responsible for the death of Mr Dunn, but insisted it had not
been intentional.
He said: ''On all the evidence, there is no shadow of a doubt that it
was me that shot the gun. But I did not intend to shoot the gun at Mr
Dunn.''
The court has heard Mr Dunn was shot from a range of between two and
12 inches as he leaned in the door of the alleged bank raiders' getaway
car.
However, Mr Smith said yesterday he had not been aware of Mr Dunn's
presence.
He added that he had not even been aware of any shot being fired from
the Glock pistol he was armed with and which he had brought back from
the Gulf.
However, he told his counsel, Mr Derek Ogg, that he now accepted on
the weight of the evidence submitted during the trial that two live
rounds must have been fired from the weapon.
Mr Smith told the court that he got into the car but became aware of a
lot of people around the vehicle and heard shouts to the effect of:
''Get them. They are only firing blanks.''
He said he decided to shoot the rear window out in an attempt to prove
that real guns were involved.
He said he tried to fire his gun three times, but they were misfires.
He decided to clear the weapon and get out of the car before escaping
from the scene.
He added: ''I never saw Mr Dunn approach the car. I never saw Mr Dunn
in the car. I just never saw him.''
The trial continues.

SCOTLAND's leading law reform body yesterday recommended major changes
in the rules of evidence in criminal cases, which it says will make
miscarriages of justice less likely.
The Scottish Law Commission has urged an end to the general ban which
prevents a jury, for example in a murder trial, hearing hearsay evidence
of another person's confession.
The rule against hearsay basically means that you cannot prove that
something happened by calling as a witness A, who did not see the
incident, to tell the court about a statement he heard from B, who did
see the incident.
Hearsay evidence is frowned upon because it is not the best evidence,
not delivered on oath and cannot be tested by cross-examination.
The law commission takes the view, however, that the current ban may
lead to injustice because it deprives the courts of information which
might help discover the truth.
In its report on hearsay evidence in criminal proceedings the
commission proposes that, with suitable safeguards against abuse,
hearsay should be allowed when there are insurmountable difficulties in
leading evidence from the person himself.
That would be when he was dead, ill, abroad, could not be found or was
brought to court but refused to take the oath or answer questions, for
example, because he did not wish to incriminate himself.
The commission has drafted its proposals into a Criminal Evidence
(Scotland) Bill which, if it became law, could lead to attempts to bring
a number of cases back to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
The most notorious recent example of the operation of the hearsay rule
was the case of Glasgow man John McLay, 19, who was jailed for life for
murder in 1992. After his conviction he produced sworn statements from
six witnesses who claimed that another man, former co-accused Stephen
Harkins, had confessed to the murder.
By a majority of 4-1 the Court of Criminal Appeal rejected McLay's
attempt to lead this new testimony on the basis that it was hearsay
evidence and therefore inadmissible.
The law commission said yesterday: ''The apprehended danger, which we
accept is a very real danger, is that in many cases accomplices of the
accused would seek to exculpate him by giving concocted evidence of
false or non-existent confessions by third parties.
''On the other hand . . . it seems undeniable that there would be a
miscarriage of justice if an innocent person were to be convicted
because he had not been entitled to adduce credible and reliable
evidence that a third party had truthfully confessed to the crime.
''We consider that under our scheme the prospect of a miscarriage of
justice would be less likely that under the present law which entirely
forbids hearsay evidence of a third party's confession.''

COUNCIL housing chiefs agreed at a meeting in Edinburgh yesterday to
press for more investment in affordable housing to offer alternatives to
people living in caravans.
They also backed calls for a survey of mobile homes in Scotland and
for legislative changes to iron out what they perceive as anomalies in
the treatment of caravan residents.
Vice-convener of Cosla's housing committee, Mrs Teresa McNally, told
the meeting that the system was failing some of the most vulnerable
people in society. She said living in a caravan was often the only
option open to people, particularly those in rural areas.
Mrs McNally also criticised the legal framework for piecemeal
development which, she claimed, does not offer caravan dwellers the same
rights as those living in more permanent homes.
The committee agreed that their concerns should also be discussed with
caravan site owners with a view to promoting better management.

THE Nolan Committee into standards in public life yesterday heard its
last session in public on the day the 1995 edition of MPs interests in
industry was published.
After six weeks of public hearings, during which they heard evidence
from 72 witnesses, the committee hopes to produce its first report in
May.
In the wake of publicity over the sleaze factor in politics, MPs have
taken care to record what might previously have been regarded as trivial
gifts.
The Nolan Committee will now digest all the evidence before making
proposals on MPs' interests, the role of lobbying organisations in the
House of Commons, jobs for Ministers leaving office, and the method of
appointing quangos.
There seemed to be general recognition that the committee could have
spent more time studying the subject.
However, the need for a speedy report outweighed that criticism,
especially as this will only be an initial report.
In the 1995 edition of the register Labour MPs disclose their union
sponsorship, usually in the form of funding a research assistant, while
Conservatives list their directorships.
Occasional journalism is a favourite entry, but the MP seldom reveals
where the journalism occurs, although Mr Alex Salmond, Scottish National
Party MP for Banff and Buchan lists his column in this newspaper and two
foreign trips.
The Prime Minister's entry, like that of most Cabinet Ministers, is
simply ''Nil''. Defence Secretary Malcom Rifkind, however, states he is
a non-practising member of the Faculty of Advocates, and Mr Ian Lang,
Secretary of State for Scotland, that he is a Member of Lloyds and has
shareholdings in Lang and Fulton Ltd.
Mr Robin Cook, Shadow Foreign Secretary and racing tipster, discloses
that he has ''received occasional hospitality at a number of race
courses, mainly from the BHB and the Tote Board.''

IF the elite of Scotland's businessmen attending the Scottish Council
Development and Industry's annual forum were expecting to see a display
of feminine solidarity, they were sadly mistaken.
Both females concerned were keynote speakers as business, trade
unions, and local government leaders met at the Gleneagles Hotel for the
forum, to discuss where Scotland would find jobs for its people in the
future.
In the blue corner was Dr Ann Robinson, policy unit head of the
Institute of Directors. In the red corner was Rosemary McKenna, Labour
councillor and president of Cosla. Both were discussing employment.
Britain needed a further dose of deregulation, the role of the state
had to be cut back, and the rule of law must not have the effect of
inhibiting employment, Dr Robinson said.
The Government had to remove the barriers which stopped employers from
taking on staff and stopped individuals from starting their own
companies, she added.
It was a good thing, said Dr Robinson, that 30% of young people were
in higher education. But they had to be more adaptable. Too many people
with a BA or BSc degree expected their own office with a potted plant
and their own secretary. When she recruited a graduate for her office,
it was made clear the graduate had to fetch the mail and clear the dirty
cups away.
Rosemary McKenna, speaking directly afterwards on training, was
clearly of the view that further education was not merely to train
people to become crockery gatherers.
It was then Dr Robinson's turn to listen to the unpalatable as Mrs
McKenna lambasted employers who took the view that unemployment levels
should be left to the market, with a vast number of unemployed being
convenient as they provided a ready pool of labour and pushed down
labour costs.
''It would be disturbing enough, even if it could be dismissed as the
views of a few unenlightened individuals, but in terms of wasted
opportunities and a total disregard for people, it is quite chilling to
contemplate that views such as these have been the focus of Government
policy for some time,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>Father's appeal to missing actor Family express 'unshakeable faith' that Stephen Fry is fine after quitting West End play</HEADLINE>

<GRAPHIC>ILLUS</GRAPHIC>

<TEXT>
0THE father of missing actor Stephen Fry's yesterday appealed for him
to get in touch with his family.
Mr Alan Fry, 64, an electronics inventor, said that he and his wife,
Marianne, 62, had not heard from their son since last Thursday, when
they attended the opening night of his West End play, Cell Mates, in
which he starred with Rik Mayall.
Speaking on Radio 4's PM programme, Mr Fry said: ''If only he would
realise how much everybody loved him and how many people were very fond
of him.''
He said that his son must have been under considerable stress. ''He
has never done anything comparable. The forces, whatever they were,
which drove him to it must have been very considerable.''
Mr Fry said none of the family was concerned that the actor was ''in
any danger'' but he admitted his disappearance was completely unexpected
and there were no warning signs.
However, he thought that his son was probably so upset at the moment
that he had not considered how people would react to his disappearance.
He said that the whole family had an ''unshakeable faith'' that
Stephen was fine, and would contact them.
Mr Fry said: ''Stephen is obviously very unhappy at the moment and
wants to be on his own.
''Something must have happened between the opening night and now. But
we don't know what.
''We are distressed and worried.''
Fry, 37, officially quit the West End play Cell Mates ''for personal
reasons'' on Wednesday, the show's sixth night.
However, he was last seen on stage on Saturday -- the show's third
night, in the play in which he stared as KGB superspy George Blake, who
was sprung from Wormwood Scrubs.
He has not been seen in public since Sunday, when he narrated Peter
and The Wolf during a charity concert at St Mary's Church, north London.
Mrs Fry, who helps her husband in his electronics business, said: ''We
know that in a day or two, or a week, the phone will go and it will be
Stephen. All the family believe that.''
Mr and Mrs Fry, who live in the tiny village of Booton, Norfolk, said
that they had met their son in his dressing room after the opening
performance and attended the first night party at the Groucho Club.
''Stephen was fine and very happy. He was absolutely normal, perfect,
and happy as he usually is,'' his father said.
Mr Fry said that he had tried to contact his son by telephone at his
London flat over the weekend to thank him for the party.
''We don't know where he is. He has not been in contact with anyone in
the family. We would obviously be a lot happier if he did get in
contact.
''Obviously, we know of places where he might have gone and we are
trying every avenue to contact him.''
He said he, his wife, Stephen's elder brother, Roger, and younger
sister, Joanna, all had ''great faith'' in Stephen.
Asked if recent mixed reviews of both their son's play and his TV show
with Hugh Laurie had affected him, Mrs Fry said: ''He is much bigger
than that. He is a very stable man and very conscientious.''
Mr Fry added: ''Obviously he is human and if he gets a bad review it
hurts. Everyone prefers praise don't they?''
Understudy Mark Anderson has filled in all this week, but Simon Ward,
who stared in Young Winston, will replace Fry as soon as possible.
Fry's agent Sarah Keene, of Corbett and Keene, said that there was no
news of the actor's whereabouts, but she said reports that he had gone
abroad ''had the ring of truth''.
She added: ''I am pretty sure he will be in contact soon and I am
certain he would be very surprised at the uproar about his
disappearance.''

Brussels
EUROPEAN Union aid for Scotland is being switched by the Government to
the south of England where Tory MPs have accused the Scots of being
subsidy junkies.
The money involved comes under the heading of so-called Objective 3
support from the European Commission's social fund which is worth #24m a
year to Scotland and #147m to the UK as a whole.
About #3m of social fund help came to Scotland last year earmarked
specifically for local enterprise companies (LECs). This represented 17%
of the UK total of #18m. In England and Wales the money goes to the
LECs' equivalent, the training and enterprise councils (TECs)
But Scotland's share of the UK total is now being cut to about 10% or
lower this year which means a drop to less than #2m.
The switch has been caused, according to Brussels sources, by the LECs
losing the arguments when required by the Government to compete for
resources with the TECs. It also indicates that the recession, which the
Government says is lifting, is still serious enough in the south of
England to require assistance for traditionally needy areas, including
Scotland, to be sent south.
In 1995, the year under review, the allocation to the UK will be
#18.2m. The LECs must compete formally with the TECs for a share.
According to the Scottish Office last night the results of the
competition process are still unknown.
''No decisions have been reached,'' a spokesman said, adding the
outcome would be known next month and that reports of a cut to as low as
7% of the previous share were, therefore, speculation.
An appeal by the LECs is due to be heard in Sheffield next Tuesday. If
the appeal, led by Scottish Enterprise, is unsuccessful the Scots share
will be no more than #1.9m.
A spokesman said: ''No final decision has been reached as yet on
funding under Objective 3 GB non-governmental programme funding. Initial
allocations indicate that the LECs' share will be around 10.4% of the
total. This is less than last year as the criteria for assessing
individual projects have been changed and, as a result, Scotland did not
score as highly. However, LECs have been invited to submit appeals
against possible non-allocation of funding for some of their project
submissions.''
Scottish National Party vice-convener Gordon Wilson said last night:
''Scotland is paying the price of the English union. We are always being
told by Mr Major that it gives Scotland strength to have negotiations
carried out at a British level.
''But here is a clear example of how Scotland is suffering for lacking
our own independent negotiators, working in Brussels for the good of
this country.''

IN THE biggest boost yet to the Lockerbie campaign, former Minister
Allan Stewart has expressed doubts over the Government's case against
Libya -- only two weeks after leaving the Scottish Office.
He has called for a re-examination of the evidence, and has offered to
travel to Libya if it will help resolve the stalemate between the
British and Libyan governments.
In particular, he is understood to be concerned at suggestions
circulating among senior legal circles that the case against the two
Libyans would not stand up in a Scottish court.
The defection of a former Minister closely familiar with the details
of the case is an embarrassing blow to the Government's claim that the
bombing of PanAm flight 103 was the work of two Libyan intelligence
agents.
Mr Stewart has discussed the case with Labour MP Tam Dalyell, who is
pressing the Government to examine what he claims is new evidence that
casts doubts on Libya's involvement.
Mr Dalyell has tabled 90 Commons questions on Lockerbie for answer
next month. The Linlithgow MP argues that the bombing, which killed 270
people, was the work of Iranian-backed terrorists taking advantage of an
American drug intelligence operation.
Scottish and American prosecutors have charged two Libyan intelligence
agents in connection with the attack, but Libya has refused to hand over
the two men. The UN has imposed sanctions on Libya to force it to
comply.
Mr Stewart has also written to Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd to
express concerns raised with him by a number of his Asian constituents
who fear that the current stalemate with Libya is depriving British
businesses of opportunities in the oil-rich state.
''There is clearly an impasse at the moment and it really can't go on
forever. I have discussed it with Tam Dalyell, and I am going to examine
the situation further,'' he said.
He added: ''Now is perhaps the time for everyone to stand back and
take a long cool look at the whole issue. Some of the points which Mr
Dalyell has raised are pertinent.''
Last night, Mr Dalyell welcomed Mr Stewart's involvement. ''It will be
difficult for the Government to do nothing now a so recently ex-Minister
in a position to know and care about Lockerbie is asking for action,''
he said.
However, Mr Stewart emphasised that he is in no way criticising the
Scottish legal system, or the Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry.
''I have complete confidence in the Lord Advocate,'' he said.

LOCAL government reform will not pose a threat to Roman Catholic
education, Cardinal Thomas Winning said yesterday.
However, Scotland's senior Roman Catholic clergyman warned that the
difficulties arising from the creation of unitary councils should not be
underestimated.
He added: ''I regard them as challenges rather than threats. Threats
only come from people who are hostile to you.''
He said that dialogue was the best way forward for guaranteeing a
''culture of care'' to benefit young people.
Cardinal Winning was addressing a conference of the Catholic Education
Commission in Scotland, of which he is president. Delegates heard that
providing denominational education for children whose primary schools no
longer fed into a Catholic secondary because of impending boundary
changes was a major concern.
Central region's director of education, Mrs Maggi Allan, said that a
denominational secondary in the authority faced the prospect of losing
two-thirds of its intake because a large percentage of its associated
primaries would be in a different single-tier council.
However, amendments to the legislation meant that cross-boundary
arrangements could take place, with the ''sending'' authority paying the
''receiving'' one for pupil transport.
Parents and pupils had the right to use the legislation and, she said,
it was important they did so.
Strathclyde region's director of education, Mr Frank Pignatelli, said
some parents who would normally send their children to a primary's
associated RC secondary were not doing so because of fear and
uncertainty about future provision.
He said: ''We have to convince parents and staff that they have to
fight for it.''

SCOTTISH Labour MPs who oppose the party decision to ban anti-abortion
campaigners from next month's conference in Inverness have formed a
group called Scottish Back benchers to hire a stall from which pro-life
information will be available.
Monklands East MP Helen Liddell yesterday confirmed that a number of
MPs have clubbed together to pay for the #1000 table. Their move follows
the Scottish party executive's decision to renew its conference ban on
the anti-abortion group Scotland for Life.
The MPs, who include Mr Brian Wilson (Cunninghame North), Mr Tony
Worthington (Clydebank and Milngavie), and Mr Gordon McMaster (Paisley
South), say the executive's ban amounts to an attack on free speech on
what is a matter of conscience.
The name Labour Backbenchers has been adopted to highlight the fact
that the stall will not only focus on abortion, but will distribute
information on a number of issues, including euthanasia.
Mrs Liddell said the stall would provide information ''so that the
debate is as fully informed as possible.''
She said that Scottish Labour MPs have been angered by the attack
earlier this week by Cardinal Thomas Winning on Labour leader Tony Blair
in which he accused Mr Blair of refusing to acknowledge the concerns of
the party's opponents of abortion.

A CANCER research facility, costing #250,000, was officially opened in
Dundee yesterday.
The laboratory at Dundee University's medical school in Ninewells
Hospital, is the latest development in a series which have made the city
one of Europe's top cancer research centres.
Last month, plans were unveiled for a #22m biomedical research centre
at the university.
The new Experimental Pathology Laboratory will focus on furthering the
understanding of cancer cells.
Professor Peter Hall, the driving force behind the initiative,
explained: ''Our work, chiefly funded by the Cancer Research Campaign,
will concentrate on the molecular events that occur in the nucleus cells
in cancer -- knowledge vital in the understanding of the disease.''
Around 25 scientists will eventually staff the laboratory which has
been funded jointly by Dundee University and charitable trusts.

LEGAL recognition of the old imperial system of measurement, based on
feet and pounds, effectively came to an end in the United Kingdom on
January 1.
You may not have noticed. The Government, with no overall majority in
the Commons, has not yet let the rest of us into the secret for fear of
incurring the wrath of its own vocal Euro-sceptic tendency.
As a result, local authorities, other public bodies and private
companies are still negotiating and signing contracts specifying
imperial units of measurement which may prove unenforceable in law.
And any planning consents issued since the start of the year,
expressed in imperial units, may also be void.
Representatives of business, local government, public agencies, and
politicians approached about the issue at the Scottish Council forum in
Gleneagles yesterday expressed surprise that such a significant move
could be happening without their knowing about it.
The Herald has acquired a copy of an internal circular from the
Department of Trade and Industry which spells out the legal confusion
and secrecy surrounding this final Whitehall move to metrication.
It states: ''No legislation made after January 1, 1995 should contain
references to imperial units, except in special cases.'' These special
cases cover the nautical mile and knot and the foot, but only as used to
measure aircraft heights, under international conventions.
Under other transitional arrangements, the acre can still be used for
land registration; the mile, yard, foot and inch and the pint for
draught beer and milk in returnable containers.
Until 1999, the fathom, therm, ounce and pound (but only for loose
goods sold from bulk) can also be retained.
The document, dated November 21, 1994 -- a mere six weeks before the
European Union's Units of Measurement Directive was due to come into
effect -- was circulated to all government departments and a number of
agencies. It is ambivalent about informing the wider world about the
impact of these changes.
''It is for departments to decide what they should do to ensure that
outside bodies for which they are responsible comply with the
directive,'' it states.
''Approaches to such bodies may result in complaints about the
imposition of such a large and unproductive burden, and criticism of the
delay in giving guidance and the continuing uncertainty about the legal
position.
''However not alerting such bodies to the implications . . . is likely
to result in many breaches of the directive.''
An appendix goes on to warn of claims for damages against the
Government from anyone who suffers loss as a result.

A SCOTTISH soldier sprinted down the Falls Road in Belfast to a
hospital carrying a young boy who could not breathe after neighbours
taking the child to hospital had become trapped in a traffic jam.
Private Jack Burns, 23, of Irvine, was on routine patrol when he was
called over to a car stuck in traffic. He saw the child had stopped
breathing and tried mouth to mouth resuscitation. When this failed, he
grabbed the little boy and ran to the nearby Royal Victoria Hospital. As
he approached the entrance, the child began to breath.
Private Burns, of the 1st Battalion Parachute Regiment, said: ''It
must have been the jolting. Medical staff took him into care
immediately.''
The child, 18-month-old Christopher Gilroy, had been suffering from a
cold when he began running a high temperature and breathing awkwardly.
His mother, Anne-Marie, knew it was serious and neighbours were taking
him to hospital when their car was caught in a traffic jam. She said:
''They knew there was no way of getting through. An army patrol was
near-by and one of the paratroopers came to help. How can we ever thank
him enough.''

TROUBLED radio station Scot FM yesterday announced a new line-up of
programmes which, it said, would turn around its fortunes.
Two presenters have been recruited -- Alison Craig from Radio Forth,
who will host two weekend shows, and Robin Galloway from NorthSound, who
takes over the weekday breakfast slot.
Mr Tom Hunter, the station's managing director, said that he had been
trying to sign up both of them for several months.
He acknowledged the station had made mistakes since its launch in
September last year, particularly with initial appointments of
presenters.
Many of those involved in the station's early stages have departed
including Donnie Munro, Haig Gordon, Kaye Adams, Bruce Findlay, and
Margo MacDonald.
Mr Hunter said he was now confident that it could build on its base of
234,000 listeners to catch up Radio Clyde and overtake it within three
years.
''This is a major turning point for us because we can now come out of
the trench bayonets fixed and go over the top.
''We have always been confident that our basic programme mix was right
but it has taken five months to find the right team to deliver it,'' he
said.
Mr Hunter said the station would be launching a #100,000 promotional
campaign, largely through television adverts. He denied suggestions that
another founder-presenter Chris Mann was about to depart.

THE public were invited yesterday to help pick a winner for Scotland's
richest art award -- the City Of Glasgow Lord Provost's Prize.
The sum of #12,000 will be presented to the winner picked from a
shortlist of six artists by a panel of critics and the public who will
vote at a ballot box.
The six artists in the running are Norman Adams, John Byrne, William
Crozier, Ken Currie, Stuart McAlpine Miller, and Jenny Saville.
The judges, who are also art collectors, are author and critic A S
Byatt, arts administrator Joanna Drew, and actor Richard Wilson.
Each artist was asked to submit a recent painting to be displayed in
the centre hall of the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum where the
public can vote for their favourites. However, Norman Adams was unable
to send a painting due to work commitments. The winner will be announced
on March 16.

ONE of the last jute mills in Dundee has been sold as part of a deal
worth up to #2.5m, it was announced yesterday.
The Sidlaw Group plc has sold its jute, flax and trading business to J
&amp; F Spinners Ltd, a newly-formed consortium.
Mills involved in the deal are the Manhattan Works in Dundee and an
operation at Gourdon, near Stonehaven.
It is undertood there are to be no redundacies at this stage arising
from the sale. Two hundred and twenty-eight jobs have been transferred
to the new owners in the deal.
Sidlaw, which moved its headquarters from Dundee to Edinburgh last
year, is retaining its face yarns business in Dundee. Just under 300
workers are employed at the company's two remaining factories which
produce man-made fibres, mainly used for carpet backings.
A new wholly-owned subsidiary will trade as New South Mills Ltd for
this part of the business.
Mr Digby Morrow, chief executive of the Sidlaw Group, said: ''This is
a historic moment for Sidlaw Group as it severs its connection with its
origins in the jute industry.''
''We are, however, pleased that we have been able to preserve the
continuity of the business by selling it as a going concern.''
He added: ''Under its new owners, the business will have the
opportunity of recovery from the difficult trading environment
experienced over the last three years. We wish them every success.''

THE chairman of the Scottish Tourist Board, appointed by Scottish
Secretary Ian Lang, is taking on the Government over the decision to axe
Motorail and sleeper services.
Mr Ian Grant, who receives #36,000 a year for a three-day-week to run
Scotland's tourism quango, has admitted that he is ''extremely
concerned'' about the effect the loss of the services will have on the
Scottish tourist industry.
In a letter to Labour Scottish Front-Bencher John McFall, Mr Grant
says he has entered into a series of meetings with interested parties to
discuss the ''severe impact'' the decision is having on the railways and
on tourism.
Labour has seized on Mr Grant's letter as evidence that even Tory
political appointees, deemed to be the Government's closest supporters,
are opposed to the loss of Motorail and the Fort William and Carlisle
sleepers.
Last night, Mr McFall said tourism brings #800m to Scotland every
year: ''I am not telling the Government to listen to the Labour Party
nor even the general public. I am asking them to listen to their own
friends.''
In his letter Mr Grant says: ''We will maintain our endeavours.
However I would have to say that I am not too optimistic.''
A Board spokesman said Mr Grant is intent on making sure ''that the
impact on tourism is recognised by officials and Ministers.''
In December, railway franchising director Roger Salmon, who is
overseeing the privatisation process, announced that Motorail and the
Fort William sleepers would not be included in the minimum requirements
for ScotRail under privatisation.
Although the Scottish Office, rail user groups, and MPs have protested
at the decision, there is no evidence yet that the Government is
prepared to require Mr Salmon to change it.
Yet the Tourist Board has been told by its clients south of the Border
that the loss of those services, which will end in May, is already
having a dramatic effect on the Scottish tourist industry.
The spokesman said: ''There is a perception in England that Scotland
will become that bit more remote as a result, a bit more cut off by the
loss of a service which is an important psychological link.''
Mr McFall said Mr Grant's lack of optimism was worrying, and that he
will seek a meeting with the chairman to discuss possible strategies for
reversing the decision.
UNLESS the figures being used to justify the cutting of the Fort
William sleeper and motorail services are exposed now as spurious, they
will be used against every rural service in the country.
That was the warning from Labour's industry spokesman Brian Wilson in
Inverness yesterday. Mr Wilson also delivered a stinging rebuke to the
leadership of Highlands and Islands Enterprise for not fighting publicly
for Highland rail services.
Mr Wilson told the Northern Scotland Transport Issues Conference that
he believed both the threatned services were very important in their own
right.
''But the principle involved is even more important because if the
withdrawal of these services go ahead without consultation on the basis
of a unilatleral decision taken by the franchise director, then it will
have massive implications for every vulnerable rail service in
Britain.''
The Scottish Secretary had said that the consultation would take place
after the services had been withdrawn ''If there is anybody here of any
political persuasion who believes that is a fair, resonable and
democratic way to proceed I would be very surprised.''
Mr Wilson said that behind it was the Treasury's agenda of
progressively reducing the rail network to a core of lines which
required no subsidy.
He claimed that in the face of the campaign to save the threatened
services, the franchising director Mr Salmon had planted a story in a
newspaper that the subsidy for each passenger on the Fort William
sleeper was #450.
''This was slightly undermined by the fact that the previous week
Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney had said it was #540.
''Whether it is #450, #540 or #1,050, what does it matter? The figures
are utterly meaningless and bogus. The Fort William sleeper attracts
20,000 passenger so according to his figures the subsidy to the sleeper
under British Rail is #9m this year. That is not true, it is a lie.''
Mr Wilson said of the HIE leadership: ''Where are they? Do they not
recognise a major Highland issue when they see one. Where are the big
men of the past? Where are the Bob Cowans, or the Lord Camerons, the
Robert Grieves, the Andrew Gilchrists?
He said theey should have the guts to Why have they been replaced by
minnows who do not have the guts to speak in public on a principle as
important as this to the future of Highland and Island communities?''
* Mr Donald McPherson, Scotrail's northern area manager confirmed that
the additional summer service between Inverness and Wick/Thurso would
not be in this summer's timetable. It was being cut because of cost.
Three services a day would now run in the summer as in winter.

NORTH EAST councillors and leaders of the fishing industry were ''very
sympathetically received'' yesterday during a Parliamentary lobby in an
attempt to secure a change to the Finance Bill.
The 16-strong all-party delegation contacted every MP with a fishing
interest to express concern that the UK will be a ''certain loser'' if
vessels of less than 100 tonnes are prevented from gaining taxation
benefits as a result of the Bill.
If enacted, they say, the legislation in its proposed form would cause
serious hardship to the Grampian, Scottish and UK fishing fleets.
The Finance Bill will permit capital allowance balancing charges on
disposal of vessels to be rolled over for a period of up to three years
from the current one-year limit.
The charges would be set against the subsequent expenditure on
replacement vessels within this three-year period. The anomaly is that
it only applies to vessels of 100 gross registered tonnes or more and
the council would like it changed to 10 tonnes.
''This is a definition aimed at pleasure craft, not the industry,''
said Councillor Mitchell Burnett of Grampian Regional Council, the
leader of the delegation.
''If it is applied it will hit most of the registered UK fleet (96.5%)
as well as the active Scottish fleet (94.2%).
''This is a matter of serious concern to Grampian Regional Council.
Grampian is the base for 26% of the Scottish fleet and concern is
mounting on all sides of the fishing industry.''
During the lobby the delegation met Treasury Minister Sir George Young
and Gordon MP Mr Malcolm Bruce.
The move came as the Scottish Fish Merchants' Federation appealed to
Scotland's fishermen to have no involvement in a one-day strike being
called by Save Britain's Fish Campaign.
They said the campaign, which is calling for Britain's withdrawal from
the Common Fisheries Policy, was doomed to failure and a one-day strike
would be the tactic of militant extremists who had ignored the reality
of their actions.
The Merchants Federation believes that the CFP is harmful to the
industry and has investigated the feasibility of supporting the
campaign.
However, it said that after taking legal advice and consulting fishing
constituency MPs, it had concluded that withdrawal from the CFP was
''quite clearly unachievable''.
Mr Robert Milne federation chief executive said the CFP did need to
change and he pledged to fight for that.
''Presently the policy is not providing for the conservation we
require, nor does it answer the socio-economic needs of our
communities.''
But he added: ''Fishermen must be aware of the implications of tie-ups
for supermarkets as they will immediately take steps to secure supplies
elsewhere, no doubt abroad. The effect of the one-day strike will be
felt for at least the next six months.''

ROLLS-Royce workers facing redundancy threatened strike action
yesterday following a mass union meeting.
More than 500 of the workforce at R-R's design and development unit at
East Kilbride decided overwhelmingly to hold a ballot to decide on
strike action.
All the employees' unions were represented at the meeting where
feeling ran high against the company who are refusing to think again
about closing the unit and concentrating design and development at its
Derby HQ.
The ballot is expected to take place in about a month.
But before then union officials will hold a works conference with
company chiefs in a last ditch attempt to persuade the management to
reconsider closure plans.
A spokesman for the workers said:''There were 550 people at the
meeting and only three voted against the call for a ballot. There
appears to be no way this company will back down from the move to shut
us down.
''The feeling at the meeting was that there is something much more
behind the decision to transfer to Derby than we have been told.''
Labour's front bench in Scotland has given massive support to the
campaign to keep the unit alive while local councillors have warned of
the devastating blow to the local economy if the unit did close.
The mass meeting did not involve R-R Aero Engine Services Ltd at East
Kilbride which was expected to announce its strike ballot decision over
pay later.

BRITISH Gas chief executive Mr Cedric Brown yesterday defended both
himself and the company against a fresh onslaught of criticism as the
group announced that it had made pre-tax profits of #1245m -- nearly #40
a second -- last year.
Labour leader Mr Tony Blair labelled such companies ''the unacceptable
face of privatisation'' while his Labour trade and industry spokesman,
Mr Brian Wilson, said the figures showed the need for a tough regulatory
regime to protect the consumer's interests.
''Gas's dash-for-cash has become a major public scandal. A company
which was, until recently, held in high public esteem is now synonymous
with corporate greed and ruthlessness,'' he added.
But Prime Minister John Major said he much preferred profits to
losses, ''provided there is a good service to customers and provided the
price is right''.
The Gas Consumers' Council reported last week that complaints about
the company were now at record levels after nearly doubling over the
past year. British Gas has also been criticised over Mr Brown's 75% pay
increase and for cutting showroom services, reducing spending on safety
checks, and its programme to shed about 25,000 jobs by 1998.
Mr Brown defended both the company and his large pay packet --
#475,000 -- which had come under fire from politicians, consumer groups,
and unions over recent months.
He said the company had to take action because it now faced intense
competition. ''We can't stand still and do nothing,'' said Mr Brown.
''We have to cut our cloth according to the new environment.''
The company was privatised in 1986 with a 100% monopoly of the gas
market, he told a London news conference, but rivals had now been
allowed to take about 60% of the important large-scale commercial and
industrial market while the domestic market would be opened up from next
year.
But he gave a personal pledge that, once the huge restructuring of the
group was complete, its previous high standards of service would return
or improve.
Mr Brown admitted the enormous shake-up of the business, designed to
save around #600m a year to face up to the competition, had inevitably
created ''stresses and strains'' as far as customer service was
concerned. But the group's commitment to high standards of service would
be the same in future and safety remained of paramount importance.
Turning to the controversial subject of boardroom pay and perks, he
said full details of all directors' remunerations and share options
would be given in the annual report sent to shareholders later in the
year.
Around 10,000 people in the core gas business took voluntary
redundancy last year, more than the company had expected. But Mr Brown
said there were no current plans to increase the job-shedding target of
25,000 over the next few years.
Mr Brown said the level of profit was appropriate for the UK's sixth
largest public company and the fifteenth largest in Europe and pointed
out that some #500m would go in tax and that the company needed
sufficient funds to invest in the future to preserve customer services
and the jobs of the remaining workforce.
Gas prices were down by around 21% for domestic customers since
privatisation after allowing for inflation and excluding last year's
imposition of VAT on gas bills, he added.
At Prime Minister's question time in the Commons, Mr Blair said the
City might view profits as reasonable but customers might take a
different view. ''Until these companies are properly regulated in the
public interest, they will continue to be seen rightly as the
unacceptable face of privatisation.''
But Mr Major insisted: ''Profits yield taxes.'' He recalled
nationalised industries used to cost taxpayers #50m a week.
Meanwhile, Scotland's local authorities yesterday attacked British Gas
over its pre-tax profits. At a conference in Glasgow, Dr Sonja Hunt said
Scotland's terrible legacy of heart disease was not the result of diet,
which she dismissed as propaganda, but cold housing.
The Right To Warmth Conference was organised by the Local Government
Forum Against Poverty to highlight the extent of fuel poverty which, it
claimed, affected one third of all Scottish homes.

THE LEGAL expert chairing the inquiry into alleged corruption and
impropriety at Monklands District Council pledged yesterday that his
report would not be a whitewash.
Professor Robert Black, who holds the chair of Scots Law at Edinburgh
University, gave the promise at the end of three days of public sessions
held this week as part of the independent inquiry.
Initiated by the council, the inquiry began three months ago and its
terms of reference include alleged religious discrimination and nepotism
regarding recruitment, housing and contracts.
In the course of his investigations, Professor Black has taken
statements in private from many members of the public and other
interested parties.
At the end of yesterday's proceedings, he stressed to everyone present
that this week's public sessions formed only a small part of the
exercise.
But he said his report, expected to be completed next month, would
seriously address all the concerns that had been raised. He added: ''I
can assure you, the report will not be a whitewash.''
Yesterday's session dealt with the council's employment policies,
practices and procedures. Professor Black began by saying: ''This is an
issue which has caused a considerable amount of concern within the area,
particularly with reference to allegations of unduly favourable
treatment being accorded to those who have connections, whether by way
of relationship or friendship, with elected members.''
The allegations concerned not just recruitment but the treatment of
employees and ''questions of promotion and grading'', he added.
The inquiry heard that councillors had previously been involved in the
process of selecting staff but that this changed following
recommendations made by a firm of consultants in 1993.
Professor Black asked Councillor Jim Smith, convener of the human
resources committee since 1992, about the old system and referred in
particular to allegations of differently coloured job application forms
being used depending on their source.
Councillor Smith said he had not been aware of coloured forms being
used at that time and had only discovered there were because of
publicity about it. He saw no need for differently coloured forms.
He was also asked whether the fact that an applicant was a relative of
a councillor would have influenced the selection procedure. Councillor
Smith replied that all candidates were considered in terms of
qualifications etc. ''If they were the best person for the job, they
would get it. They would not be treated any differently.''
Mr Ian Crawford, who joined the council as head of human resources
management in 1993, said: ''In any short-listing or interviewing
process, it should be neither an advantage nor a disadvantage if a
person is related or known to any councillor or official.''

JAMES Herriot, Britain's best known vet, died yesterday. The author of
All Creatures Great and Small was 78. His family were at his bedside at
his home near Thirsk, North Yorkshire.
His granddaughter, Ms Emma Page, said he had died from cancer of the
prostate. ''He had been ill for three years but he had borne his illness
very patiently and bravely. His family were all with him when he died
peacefully at home today.''
His first book, If Only They Could Talk, launched a writing career
which made him one of Britain's most successful contemporary authors.
He became a household name following the TV series All Creatures Great
and Small and films. An entire area of one of the most beautiful parts
of England became known as James Herriot Country, creating a prosperous
tourist industry.
Christopher Timothy, who played James Herriot in All Creatures Great
and Small over 13 years, paid fond tribute to the man ''who changed my
life''.
''I knew and loved him very much. I had the highest regard for him as
did everybody else. He was everything you would have expected from the
books,'' he said.
James Herriot achieved massive international fame through his books,
but his first love was always working as a vet.
He became a publishing phenomenon, with each book becoming a
bestseller.
James Herriot began life in Sunderland, the son of a book-loving
shipyard worker.
But when he was aged just three weeks, his family moved to Glasgow,
when his father found a new job as a cinema pianist.
At the age of 13 Herriot read a magazine article about a career in
veterinary surgery, and his mind was made up. He attended Hillhead High
School and Glasgow University.
His life as a vet in the Dales -- interrupted only by wartime service
in the RAF -- continued for 25 years before he even put pen to paper.
He leaves a widow, Joan, a son, also James, who runs the veterinary
practice in Thirsk, daughter Mrs Rosie Page, and four grandchildren.

THE search for three climbers missing in the Glencoe hills since
Wednesday night was due to resume at first light today amidst growing
fears they have been caught in an avalanche less than a mile from the
main road.
The entire Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team was very nearly hit by an
avalanche itself as it made its first attempts to locate the party.
The climbers were named yesterday as Mr Allan Lang, 50, a research
engineer from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, his son Allan, 18, a student,
and his friend Paul Bower, 18, a student from Wakefield.
They had been climbing in a corrie about 800ft up the 3,345ft
Buachaille Etive Mor in what was described as an afternoon's recreation
rather than a serious climbing expedition.
The three are understood to be well equipped.
However, while Mr Lang is an experienced climber, he is not thought to
have been out on the hills for some years. The two younger men are not
understood to have done much climbing.
Mr Lang's wife, Christine, who had been with the party until about
2pm, raised the alarm.
The Glencoe Mountain Rescue made its first search on Wednesday night.
Team leader, Mr John Grieve, told the Herald last night: ''We were
going into the gully where we think the three had been caught by an
avalanche, when there was an absolutely massive one which just missed
four of our members by seconds. It was a fluke they got out.
''It was as close as you will ever get. If it had been 10 minutes
earlier, the whole team would have been caught in it.
''We think there is about 3000 tonnes of snow in there between the two
avalanches. When it is light you can post lookouts who can warn you by
radio when an avalanche is coming. That's what we did today, but you
can't do that in darkness, so we had to stand the search down with light
fading.''
He added: ''Our biggest problem today was the sheer depth of the
avalanche. We had to dig trenches and probe down 20ft to 25ft into the
snow. I can't see them surviving in that. The only real chance they have
of being alive is that they have gone somewhere else, but it doesn't
look like it.''

MPs, perhaps anxious to stay clear of ''sleaze'' accusations, have
rushed to declare dozens of apparently insignificant gifts and benefits.
The new Register of Members' Interests, published yesterday, showed
that MPs enjoyed days at the races, travel to the World Cup, trips to
Wimbledon,
However, the register, in which MPs are supposed to list outside
interests, also contained a series of declarations which seemed to show
an overwhelming urge to be seen to be whiter than white.
Labour leader Tony Blair revealed that the British Phonographic
Industry had hosted a visit by him and his family to a charity premiere
of Oliver!
Government whip Greg Knight, without apparent embarrassment, admitted
being given free concert tickets by Frankie Valli.
Toby Jessel, Tory MP for Twickenham, disclosed that British Telecom
sponsored a concert at which he performed a Mozart piano concerto and
confessed: ''I was unpaid, but the sponsorship has affected my attitude
to the sponsors.''

ARMY Minister Nicholas Soames yesterday discounted claims that further
changes are planned to Scots regiments.
In the annual Commons debate on the Army, he was challenged by Labour
MP Norman Godman on reports that there were plans to do away with more
Scottish regiments and to place them on the same footing as
American-style infantry battalions without a territorial identification.
Dr Godman, MP for Greenock and Port Glasgow -- and a former military
policeman -- said there was deep concern on the part of many people in
Scotland over speculation that there would be ''further merging of
regiments.''
The MP pointed out that infantrymen needed to have absolute faith in
their officers and NCOs and that this was more easily achieved within
the existing framework.
Mr Soames told him: ''I am very happy indeed to give you my assurance
that no such moves are planned whatsoever.''
The Minister was supportive -- although he announced no new
initiatives -- of the cases of Private Lee Clegg and the two Scots
Guardsmen, James Fisher, from Ayrshire, and Mark Wright, from Arbroath.
Fisher and Wright were jailed recently for life after being found
guilty of murdering a teenager, shot in Belfast while they were on duty
almost two-and-a-half years ago. Clegg is serving a life sentence for
killing a Belfast joyrider while on duty at a checkpoint.
Mr Soames paid tribute to the role of the armed forces in Northern
Ireland and said: ''As the House will realise, operating in the face of
terrorism places a great burden on all ranks and, when difficulties for
our soldiers arise we have a high responsibility to resolve them
effectively.
''That, of course, is the reason we have provided all possible legal
and welfare support to Private Clegg and to Guardsmen Fisher and Wright,
and why we shall co-operate fully with the review of the law announced
recently by the Home Secretary.''
This was a reference to a proposal that the charge of murder should be
reduced to manslaughter in cases of self-defence or ''in the course of
duty.''
For Labour, Defence spokesman John Reid was supportive of the
Government line on Northern Ireland. Praising the role of soldiers in
the Province, he said: ''The professionalism of the British Army is
without doubt the highest of any army in the world. I can think of no
army that could have conducted itself under such circumstances with so
many young men and women and committed so few mistakes.''
Dr Reid also renewed his party's call for a full-scale defence review,
saying three rounds of cuts had been carried out in two years.

THE Prime Minister, determined to defend his European policy in the
Commons, could face the first backlash from Ulster Unionists and the
prospect of a humiliating setback.
Nine Unionist MPs, still smouldering over the framework document on
the future of Northern Ireland, warned they were considering voting
against the Government in Labour's debate on Wednesday on EU policy.
Defeat would bring an emergency confidence debate with the
Government's future on the line.
Mr Major raised the stakes by announcing he would open the debate for
the Government, a highly unusual step for a Prime Minister to take on an
Opposition motion.
Downing Street said Mr Major had decided to open the debate because he
wanted to make an ''authoritative'' statement on Government policy.
Labour, who had planned that Shadow Foreign Secretary Robin Cook would
open for it, responded immediately by announcing that leader Tony Blair
would do so instead.
However, Mr Major's chance of surviving any emergency confidence
debate is boosted by the latest Mori opinion poll, showing Labour has
widened its lead to 34%: Labour 58% (up 2%), Conservatives 24% (down
3%), Liberal Democrat 14% (same). In those circumstances Tory MPs who
abstain on Wednesday are unlikely to do so again and face a General
Election.
The nine Unionist MPs met in party leader James Molyneaux's office at
Westminster yesterday to discuss their response to the framework
document which they regard as a ''blueprint for a united Ireland''.
Security spokesman Ken Maginnis later warned that the Government could
not depend on their support and he reminded Ministers they had helped to
defeat them over VAT on fuel.
''We never, ever did rule out the possibility of voting against the
Government,'' he said. ''We will be looking very carefully when we see
the wording of that motion and deciding how we should vote.''
Mr Major, who recently called his Cabinet to order on Europe,
emphasised yesterday he accepted that the prospect of a single currency
raises serious political as well as economic issues and repeated that he
did not rule out a referendum on the question.
This could be seen as a rebuke to Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, who said
in an interview that the currency question did not raise constitutional
issues. He is known to oppose a referendum.
Labour sought to exploit the anger of the Unionist MPs and the
reluctance of some Conservative MPs, as well as the nine Tory MPs
without the party whip, to support Mr Major's line on Europe.
The Liberal Democrats said they would back the Labour motion and with
only one Unionist, Sir James Kilfedder, indicating he would vote with
the Government and most or all of the nine unwhipped Tories likely to
abstain, the result could be on a knife edge.
Labour's motion reads: ''That this House does not support HMG policy
towards the European Union and does not believe it promotes the interest
of the British people.''
Mr Cook said: ''Everyone who is critical will have a chance to
register their criticism. Labour will use the debate both to set out its
positive agenda and to expose the inability of a totally divided Tory
Party to provide any coherent policy on Europe.''
One rebel Tory, Mrs Teresa Gorman, will today put the case for her
Bill for a referendum on Britain's future in Europe. Her supporters,
however, fear the Government and Opposition whips will again discourage
most MPs from voting. They did this with a similar proposal by the
Liberal Democrats, when their resolution supporting a referendum was
carried, but with only 50 MPs voting.
The Government faces another difficult European challenge on Monday
night when it asks the House to support its report to the European
Commission on its social and economic goals which it is obliged to make
under the Maastricht Treaty. Last year Ministers had a majority of 55.
This year it could be closer.
The Mori poll in today's Times provides additional reasons for Tory
MPs to sustain the Government in power. It finds that Tory support among
the middle classes has reached a record low, with Labour out-polling it
by 50% to 30%.
There is a sharp drop in economic optimism, now the lowest since the
autumn of 1992.
The poll was taken before the Prime Minister's Northern Ireland
initatives were unveiled, but had shown dissatisfaction with both the
Government and Mr Major at a record high, and the public taking a
generally favourable view of Mr Blair.

GAS is a rather dodgy topic for politicians to tackle, given their own
association with hot air in the public mind.
However, Mr Blair, not exactly boldly going where no politician had
gone before, got stuck into British Gas, whose #1 bn profit, he
suggested, would not be popular with consumers of their product.
This had all the makings of a standard Major-Blair exchange,
especially by comparison with the higher level they had operated on the
previous day over Northern Ireland.
Mr Blair would say how the profit and the bosses' pay increases were a
disgrace. Mr Major would say how prices had dropped and services
improved since privatisation. Shelling from the trenches, not real
hand-to-hand stuff.
They both did as expected, Mr Blair, as the Prime Minister noted,
skipping nimbly from one basis of calculating prices to another to give
himself the best figures (it's an occupational disease of politicians).
Things only got interesting when Mr Blair, who had been sustaining
some fairly noisy heckling from the Tory back benches, rather lost his
way in a question which was, in any event, becoming too elaborate for
its own good.
Pausing, he stuck his chin out and snapped at the Prime Minister:
''Let me tell you and the Conservative Party.'' ''Ooh,'' squealed some
Tories in pretended fear. It was a ''Bambi snarls'' sensation. ''I tell
you,'' repeated Mr Blair toughly. ''Ooh,'' the Tories squealed again.
There are ways of being tough in the Commons, but the ''let met tell
you'' approach is not a good one. It sounds a bit juvenile and it sound
as if you have been rattled.
Mr Blair provided some evidence of this, by adding: ''I see the yobbos
are out in force.'' Yobbos were recommended, readers might remember, by
Tory deputy chairman John Maples to put Mr Blair off his stride in a
secret strategy document which someone helpfully leaked.
The Tories did not, of course, import yobbos into the House following
Mr Maples' suggestion. The only way to have done that was by
by-elections not a viable method in the current state of the
Government's public standing. However, they had some ready, and Mr Blair
will just have to learn to deal with them.
It doesn't look too good if the Speaker has to come too often to a
Front Bencher's assistance although if all the yobbos can manage is
sheer volume she will.
Mr Blair finished off with the need to control such companies and such
price and wage rises in the public interest, which sounds good but could
cause some problems were he actually to try and do it in office.
Mr Major consulted his brief and told us that gas prices had dropped
20% after allowing for inflation since privatisation and that in the bad
old days such industries when owned by the state cost the taxpayer #50m
a week in subsidies.
Now British Gas coughs up profits for the Exchequer to tax and use to
provide better public services. In any event, he reminded those of us
who might not have noticed, Mr Blair had ''provided no alternative
whatsoever.''
A Tory then pointed out to him that the Liberal Democrat leader Mr
Ashdown, who usually gets called to ask him a question on Thursdays, was
not in his place. ''I have no objection to his absence,'' replied Mr
Major succinctly -- and that disposed of Paddy.

<TEXT>
THE Prime Minister comes to Glasgow today to try to knit together a
coherent devolution strategy in the wake of his Ulster initiative. Late
last night Mr Major was still working on the details of his keynote
speech in which he must resolve profound questions about his policy.
He will launch another passionate defence of the Union as it applies
to Scotland and England when he speaks to 900 Scottish businessmen,
whose future investment judgments could depend on his strategy.
The Tory party in Scotland is looking to Mr Major to explain why an
assembly in Belfast is a good idea, but a Scottish parliament would be a
disaster.
Mr Major is fully aware that Scottish Tory politicians are deeply
concerned that their arguments against an Edinburgh assembly have been
undermined by his peace initiative for Ulster which makes a revived
Belfast assembly essential to maintaining the ceasefire and providing a
long term political solution.
Today the Prime Minister will assert that there are key differences
between the Irish and Scottish political situations. He is expected to
emphasise that a Belfast assembly would have no tax raising powers,
whereas Labour's plans for a Scottish parliament would concede this
essential right.
Late last night, No. 10 and Tory Central Office were still working to
prepare a presentation for the Prime Minister that will convince all the
prime business motivators in Scotland that their forward investment
strategies should be based on his conception of the Union.
Yesterday in the Commons Mr Major was confronted with this dilemma --
the difference between his belief in a Northern Ireland Assembly with
widespread powers on education, housing, and co-operation with the
Republic -- and his passionate denial of an assembly, or parliament in
Scotland.
He was questioned by Mr Mike Watson, Labour MP for Glasgow Central,
who said that by announcing plans for an assembly in the province in the
previous day's framework document he had ''conceded that power can and
should be devolved to each of the different countries of the UK,
precisely because each of those countries is distinct and different''.
Mr Major replied: ''I don't accept the parallel you put before the
House. There are a range of distinct differences between the position
faced in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the UK.
''In Northern Ireland the assembly will not be tax raising -- the
assembly proposed for Scotland would be.
''In Northern Ireland there has been a sectarian divide of remarkable
proportions for many years -- that doesn't exist elsewhere.
''In Northern Ireland neither of the parties can form part of the UK
Government and lead that Government -- that doesn't apply in any other
part of the UK.''
''In Northern Ireland a part of the population may wish to form part
of a foreign country. That does not apply anywhere else.''
Mr Major added: ''Those are some of the differences. I can stretch
that list to the corner of the chamber and back again.''
In a letter to him the SNP leader, Mr Alex Salmond, conceded that it
did not follow that the right democratic solution for one country was
automatically right for the other.
But, he said, the principle of self determination was universal. While
he had accepted that Scots could exercise the right of self
determination at a General Election he had gone much further in Northern
Ireland.
There he was ''actively and, indeed, impartially facilitating a
process of popular consent culminating in a referendum''.
Mr Salmond added: ''In contrast, in Scotland you are actively
frustrating the process by which Scots could determine our own future.
''In Ireland you are part of the solution. In Scotland you are
undoubtedly part of the problem. I much prefer the broad statesmanship
with which you are pursuing your duties in Northern Ireland with the
narrow partisanship of your approach in Scotland.
''Is it too much to hope that, when you speak in Glasgow tomorrow
evening, we could witness a welcome change both in your tone and the
substance of your policy towards Scotland?''

IT WILL be nearly four years before Dounreay will be able to begin
neutralising the radioactive nitric acid it discharges into the Pentland
Firth every day, and the plant now faces the prospect of prosecution.
The Herald revealed last week that Dounreay's operators, the Atomic
Energy Authority, had been making the discharges in direct contravention
of the Control of Pollution Act for the past 10 years. The revelations
helped persuade the AEA of the need to act, according to Mr Duncan
Buchanan, director of the Highland River Purification Board.
He told The Herald last night: ''We have been in discussion with the
Atomic Energy Authority at Dounreay for about two years but we felt we
were being railroaded. We found it extremely difficult to obtain an
agreement up until now. The greatest progress was made following the
recent publicity about the discharges.
''Although the authority has now belatedly agreed to neutralise the
discharge it will not be in a position to commission the necessary new
plant until the end of 1998. While I am pleased they have finally agreed
to neutralise the discharges, I am still not convinced the authority is
giving this a high enough priority.
''I am not happy with the timescale and because of that we are
preparing a report for the procurator-fiscal with a view to prosecution.
I want to discuss with him the possibility of prosecuting the authority
for an offence under the Control of Pollution Act.''
Mr Buchanan said the position was complicated by the fact that the
discharges were radioactive and therefore involved HM Industrial
Pollution Inspectorate.
In fact the IPI has already been made aware of Dounreay's discharges.
Earlier this week the procurator-fiscal in Wick, Mr Alasdair MacDonald
forwarded to the inspectorate's Edinburgh HQ an offical complaint from
the Highland Green Party's nuclear spokesman, Mr John Martin.
AEA's spokesman at Dounreay, Mr Ian Shepherd, said last night that
discussions were still on-going between AEA and the purification board.
He could make no further comment on Mr Buchanan's statement.
Meanwhile, 200 jobs are at risk through privatisation at the Caithness
plant according to the IPMS union. The union claims that between 300 and
400 jobs will be shed at the AEA's other sites.

THE former commander of the United Nations troops in Bosnia,
Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, came under attack last night from
Scotish Labour MP Calum MacDonald, who accused him of telling a
''complete fabrication'' about alleged ''ethnic cleansing'' by Bosnian
government forces.
Mr MacDonald (Western Isles), in a speech which brought protests from
both sides of the House, alleged Sir Michael had accepted gifts of oil
paintings from the Serbs and suggested there had been fears he would
leak sensitive Nato information to them.
The attack, during the annual Commons debate on the Army, came in
stark contrast to high praise of the General and his work in Bosnia from
Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames and Labour Defence spokesman Dr
John Reid.
Mr MacDonald raised a statement by Sir Michael, the former chief of
the UN Protection Force, on a BBC Panorama programme that Bosnian
government forces had carried out ''ethnic cleansing'' against the
Serbian population of Gorazde.
The MP said there was no evidence to back up the claim, which he said
he suspected the General had made ''to excuse failures of his own
mission in Gorazde last year, by smearing Bosnia government forces and
by smearing the Bosnia government itself''.
Intervening, Dr Reid cautioned him against relying on press reports
about the war, because of propaganda.
Mr MaDonald asked Ministers: ''Do you think it acceptable for the most
senior British officer in Bosnia to have broadcast such a publication
about the Bosnian government via the BBC?''
Mr MaDonald said: ''It is small wonder, given that background, that
General Rose's relations with the Bosnian government sank to absolute
rock bottom by the time he left his command.
''Nor was it surprising that he should have been showered with gifts
-- two oil paintings, no less -- by General (Ratko) Mladic, Karadzic's
commander, on his departure.''
To Tory protests, Mr MacDonald said: ''His happy acceptance of such
gifts, I feel, is another example of his lack of judgment.''
Later, as Mr MacDonald continued his speech, Defence Procurement
Minister Roger Freeman angrily intervened to tell him: ''The House would
feel you have gone too far.''
To Tory cheers, Mr Freeman declared: ''I honestly believe that the
charges you are laying against Lt Gen Rose are unfair and unjustified,
and I hope you will reconsider your position.''
Mr MacDonald retorted: ''I would happily look at any evidence you may
care to present me that shows that what General Rose claimed about what
happened in Gorazde is in fact true.''
Dr Reid again intervened from the Labour Front Bench, telling Mr
MacDonald: ''What may have caused offence was the implication that
General Rose was in some way being showered with and accepting gifts
from the Serbs.
''I hope you would take the opportunity to put on record that you were
in no way suggesting that there was anything which impinged the honour
of that British officer.''
Mr MacDonald replied: ''I happily do that. There was no implication
intended whatsoever of that kind.
''My point was that it showed a very serious lack of judgment to have
accepted such gifts, and I hold to that firmly.''

INTERNATIONAL swindler Michael Austin last night began a life sentence
for murder after ordering a ruthless contract ''hit'' on accountant
David Wilson.
But the hunt continues for the professional killers who calmly tied up
Mr Wilson's family at his luxury home near Chorley, Lancashire, before
taking him to the garage and shooting him twice through the head with
their silenced automatics.
The 47-year-old victim paid with his life for refusing to go along
with the American crook's international multi-million pound cigarette
fraud and trying to protect those who stood to lose a fortune from
Austin's elaborate sting.
Dressed in a blue velvet suit, Austin showed no emotion as a jury at
Carlisle Crown Court found him guilty of murder, merely jotting down
notes on a pad as he had done frequently during his seven-week trial. He
was branded by the judge, Mr Justice Kay, as ''wicked and evil''.
Mr Wilson's wife Barbara and daughters Michelle, 28, and Lisa Marie,
26, wept with relief as the verdicts were returned.
Austin had used a string of bizarre aliases to hide his identity,
including that of a fictitious Mexican army colonel called Hector
Portillo, as he set up his elaborate fraud involving a non-existent
consignment of Marlboro cigarettes.
When Mr Wilson, one of the middle men selling the cigarettes to
commodity dealers world-wide, realised what was going on he tried to
protect his customers, defying threats from Austin.
Austin ordered his execution and it was ruthlessly carried out on
March 5, 1992, by two gunmen who were so cool that police believe they
were special services-trained.
Detectives revealed after yesterday's verdict that one of the killers
had left a fingerprint on the tape used to bind Mr Wilson's hands -- a
vital clue that may yet lead to their detection.
Police believe one of the killers called himself Alan Rayner -- a name
referred to in two faxes sent by Austin to accomplice Stephen Schepke --
and they are trying to trace anyone who dealt with a man going by this
name early in 1992. Schepke was jailed for life in 1993 for aiding and
abetting in Mr Wilson's murder.
Detective Superintendent Bob Denmark, in charge of the continuing
murder hunt, said Austin was a dangerous, intelligent and cunning man --
but could have underestimated how thoroughly murders are investigated in
the UK.
''His chief mistake was that he thought he could pull off the perfect
crime, and there is no such thing,'' he said.
The telephone was to prove the vital link that led to Austin's
detection through his web of aliases after a huge investigation that
took Lancashire police to 18 countries.
They set up a special computer programme that ran a massive check on
every phone bill in the United States until it revealed the one
telephone that had made calls to Schepke and two others involved in the
cigarette plot -- Austin's phone at his home in Inwood Terrace, Fort
Lee, New Jersey.
It was the beginning of the end for Austin, but for Mr Wilson's family
the ordeal will not end until the men Austin paid to kill him are
caught.
Mrs Wilson said as she left court yesterday: ''I hope the police will
now get the two gunmen.''

Robbie Dinwoodie reports from Belfast: The old guard of Ulster
Unionist politicians was marching out of time with opinion in the
province last night.
While Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionist Party and their harder line
DUP rivals led by the Rev Ian Paisley continued to rail against the
framework document on North-South relations, others were taking a
markedly more conciliatory line.
Those speaking on behalf of Loyalist paramilitary groups made clear
that, in spite of their reservations, about what they described as
Nationalist-led proposals, they did not envisage going back to the
bullet or bomb.
People were to be seen walking the streets of Belfast clutching copies
of the document, while the business community in Northern Ireland gave
the proposals a guarded welcome.
There was a broad welcome for the proposals from both the SDLP, whose
leader John Hume was instrumental in initiating the peace process and
from Sinn Fein, the political wing of those who were persuaded to lay
down their arms.
* BRITISH voters are showing clear signs of frustration at the refusal
by Ulster Unionists to discuss Anglo-Irish peace moves, a poll showed
last night.
A Gallup poll for today's Daily Telegraph showed overwhelming 92%
backing for the peace proposals.

CHILDREN at a nursery were given antibiotics yesterday after a
three-year-old boy was taken to hospital with meningitis.
His condition at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee was described as
''stable''.
Parents of 50 children at the nursery were advised to have their
children examined by a doctor.
A spokesman for Tayside Health Board said the boy was admitted early
on Wednesday morning. ''His condition has been confirmed as
meningococcal septicaemia.''
He added: ''All close contacts have been identified and are being
offered antibiotic treatment. We would stress that close and prolonged
contact is required to risk infection.''
Parents of children at Daisy's Kindergarten in Brown Street, Dundee,
were issued with a letter advising them to take their children to their
GP.
Ms Lynn Bird, manager of the nursery, said: ''One wee boy has been
taken to hospital. I have been told that he is responding to treatment.
''We have 50 under-fives here. Their parents are obviously worried and
we have advised them to take their children to the doctor.
''Some of the children in his group and three adult helpers have been
given antibiotics.''
She said the child ''was only infectious for four days'' and had been
at the nursery on Friday and Monday. ''His parents are concerned that he
will be stigmatised as having brought the virus into the nursery.''
One woman, Mrs Adeline Grant, 52, of Fyffe Street, Dundee, who has a
three-year-old grandson, Stephen, at the nursery, said: ''We are a bit
worried about this. My daughter took Stephen straight to the doctor this
morning. He has been put on antibiotics as a precaution.''
Mrs Linda Crossan, 34, of Liff near Dundee, took her four-year-old son
Andrew to the GP. She said: ''I think they've caught it in time.
''The doctor said there's a very slim chance of Andrew being
infected.''
Mrs Masine Abdulkadir, of Roseangle, Dundee, whose son Raihan, two,
attends the nursery, said she had taken him to the doctor and he ''seems
fine. It was just a safety precaution''.

THE Commons yesterday paid tribute to Father of the House and Tory
former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath on his 45th anniversary of
becoming an MP.
Sir Edward, who won his Old Bexley and Sidcup seat with a 15,699
majority at the last election, scraped home by just 133 votes in
February 1950 when he was first returned for the former Bexley
constituency.
Aged 78, Sir Edward said: ''I am delighted to have been able to serve
my constituents for 45 years -- and I very much look forward to the next
45 years.''
In the House, to cheers -- and a smile from Sir Edward -- Commons
Leader Tony Newton told MPs during exchanges on forthcoming
parliamentary business: ''Since I see he is in place, may I take this
opportunity to say that I think the whole House would wish to
congratulate the Father of the House.''
Last night, Sir Edward was feted at a party at 12 Downing Street --
home of the Chief Whip and a job he once held -- at which there was a
''distinguished line-up'' of guests.

CROSS Channel ferries suffered massive disruption yesterday and face
the same again today as French seafarers blockade channel ports in
protest at the use of cut-price Polish crews on a British-owned
freight-only service between Folkestone and Boulogne.
Many services were cancelled and others switched from Calais to the
Belgian port of Zeebrugge, which is a further 2[1/2] hours from Dover.
But Channel Tunnel services from Folkestone to Calais were unaffected
with operators reporting a ''particularly busy day''.
French unions have objected to crews from outside the EU on some UK
ferries, particularly those run by Meridian.
They fear that if Meridian uses Polish crews then other operators will
follow suit. Their action is due to continue until midnight.
French riot police were called to disperse strikers at Boulogne,
allowing Meridian to continue its service.
Meridian has said it was prepared to replace its Polish seamen with
French ones but that UK pay rates would apply. But the French want the
replacements to receive French wage levels, which are among the highest
in the world.
The British seafarers' union RMT is sympathetic to the cause but is
debarred from taking similar action by the UK's industrial relations
legislation.

<HEADLINE>Former council chief resigns from Lottery post after two weeks</HEADLINE>

AFTER only two weeks in his new post controlling the distribution of
more than #2000m of Lottery money to sport in England, the former chief
executive of Gordon District Council has quit.
Mr Michael Barron, 53, resigned from the #60,000-a-year job on
Wednesday, just 13 working days after starting at the Sports Council's
London headquarters in charge of 43 staff.
One of the factors which led him to resign was the ''sustained
pressure and criticism'' over his having taken the job in the first
place following his retirement from Gordon District Council four months
earlier.
Mr Barron is understood to have received a #64,000 lump sum and a
pension of around #20,000 and councillors, officials, and politicians
expressed surprise at his appointment. It was discussed in private by
Gordon District Council which decided to take no action.
At that time, Alford-born Mr Barron said he did not retire on the
grounds of ill health and was extremely enthusiastic about what he
described as ''the most exciting job in sport and the greatest
opportunity that any one person has had to influence the future
direction of sport in the UK''.
However, this week Mr Barron decided that opportunity would now fall
to someone else. ''For personal reasons, I tendered my resignation to
the Sports Council as director of the Lottery,'' he said yesterday.
''After a few weeks in the post and having worked excessive hours --
in excess of 60 per week -- and the likelihood of this continuing over
the foreseeable future to meet an end of March deadline, I felt I should
take stock and decided, with the agreement of the executive, that I
should relinquish my post.
''Despite having a two-year contract and looking forward to probably
the most exciting job in sport, I felt that as a result of sustained
pressure and criticism as to my taking up a full-time post and having
accepted a retiral package from Gordon District Council, that I was best
to think of my own present good health and family obligations.''
Mr Barron had resigned from the Scottish Sports Council before to
taking up the Lottery post. He is a former director of Monklands
District Council and was the man behind the world indoor bowling
championships staged at Coatbridge from 1979 to 1986.
Gordon District Council agreed that Mr Barron be allowed to retire
''in the interests of the service'' in October last year after he had
been on sick leave for a number of weeks.
While he was chief executive between May 1992 and October 1994, he was
absent due to ill health on eight occasions totalling 19 weeks and three
days.
Council officials went to Edinburgh to seek counsel's opinion and
determined that it might have been appropriate to terminate his
employment on the grounds of ill health and asked him to attend a
medical examination. He passed the medical and no further action was
taken.
When he took ill again, the council decided to reconsider its position
and on June 14 last year Mr Barron wrote to councillors indicating he
was prepared to consider retiral ''in the interests of the service'',
adding that ''while I am recovering from illness, there is a chance of
recurrence'' at a time ''when leadership is critical''.
The council gave him early retirement on the basis of an enhancement
of 10 years' reckonable service in terms of both pension and lump sum
entitlement.
Yesterday Gordon District Council said it had been informed of Mr
Barron's decision to resign. ''However, as this is a matter between Mr
Barron and the Sports Council, Gordon District Council is unable to
comment further on the matter,'' a statement said.

THE Queen Mother is ill and last night was unable to attend a
reception to mark her 60th anniversary as Honorary Colonel of the London
Scottish TA regiment.
Her attendance at the event was cancelled at the last minute. Clarence
House confirmed that she was suffering from a cold and had been advised
by doctors to cancel engagements.
According to sources, she has a bad throat and has no voice. ''At 94
years of age it would have been silly for her to attend,'' a Buckingham
Palace press officer said last night.
The Queen Mother was said to be more than disappointed at being unable
to attend the reception at the regimental headquarters in Horseferry
Road, London, which went ahead in her absence.
Last night's reception was to be the first event to mark the 60th
anniversary which falls on May 6.
The regiment -- the first TA infantry regiment to see action in the
First World War and which parades in Hodden grey kilts -- is still
planning a march past of pipes and drums outside Clarence House on June
15.
''Despite Her Majesty's absence, the party went on,'' a London
Scottish spokesman said. ''Everyone was disappointed that the Queen
Mother could not be with us and we have sent her our best wishes for a
speedy recovery.''
''With people coming from as far away as Inverness, we could not
cancel the reception. There were a lot of disappointed people here.''
It had been intended that the Queen Mother would have spent up to 50
minutes speaking to guests.

MICHAEL Austin is a criminal mastermind whose activities around the
world have netted him an estimated #58m.
The New Yorker, whose closest associates did not even know his real
name, likes to boast that he had the two best lawyers in the world --
''Smith and Wesson'' -- and used at least 50 aliases.
As he set up the international Marlboro cigarette fraud which was to
lead to his order for the death of David Wilson, Austin posed as Mexican
army colonel ''Hector Portillo'', saying he was a cousin of the former
Mexican president, Luis Portillo, attached to the United Nations in New
York.
Police believe Austin, 39, amassed his fortune with a series of
illegal deals in drugs, arms, sugar and gold. He is known to have run
guns to Nicaragua and had links with heroin and cocaine smuggling
organisers in the Rome and Colombian underworlds.
Brooklyn-born Austin, an only child, had vast sums of ready cash --
but lived with his mother in an unimposing apartment in the middle-class
area of Fort Lee, across the Hudson from Manhattan.
He covered his tracks by renting offices in false names and equipping
them with telephone answering and fax machines -- the only way he could
be contacted. Money was in accounts in banks all over North America and
Europe.
''Everything led to false names or to Hector Portillo. The only time
the name Michael Austin came into the frame was after he was arrested,''
said one detective.
Austin had an unostentatious lifestyle and few, if any, friends. One
of his few luxuries was his blue Rolls-Royce -- even that was eight
years old.
He was caught just once, in April 1986, in the Dominican Republic,
after which a New York Federal Court jailed him for two months over the
sale of counterfeit $100 notes.
Throughout his seven-week trial for murder at Carlisle Austin sat in
the dock, surrounded by files of papers, showing no emotion and making
copious notes. He dressed smartly, but the drooping moustache which
helped his pose as Portillo was gone.
Charles Rose, the former assistant New York district attorney, who
secured the first warrant for Austin's extradition in the US after Mr
Wilson's murder, said: ''He is totally emotionless, and the word best to
describe his appearance is bland. He is driven by greed and
insecurity.''
0 Detectives believe Austin probably always intended that David Wilson
should die, once he served his purpose in setting up the massive fraud.
But the bitter disagreement between the two -- Austin dubbed the
accountant ''Mr Arrogant'' -- prompted him to order the murder in the UK
that proved his downfall. He is believed to have ordered killings
before, by luring victims to a Third World country where the crime would
be undetected.
0 Austin is wanted in several countries. Trials in several countries
over the Marlboro fraud are still awaited -- but police believe the
fraudulent trade in the non-existent cargo still goes on.
