<HEADLINE>Asthma case four share #200,000 Debate is reopened on animal lab experiments</HEADLINE>

FOUR former Glasgow University workers have won a combined total of more than
#200,000 damages after contracting asthma from their work in animal experiment
laboratories.
The rare award, which was made out of court following a series of hearings in
the Court of Session earlier this year, has reopened the debate about the
secrecy surrounding scientific experiments on animals.
The university admitted liability and a spokesperson claimed last night that
procedures had been improved in the light of the case.
Two of the four chose to highlight their plight but the other two asked that
their identities be concealed for fear of reprisals from militant animal rights
groups.
The lab workers claimed they contracted allergic asthma through close contact
with mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits used in experiments by different
departments of the university. Their jobs involved feeding and watering the
animals, taking blood samples, and cleaning out their cages.
The four have alleged they were not provided with proper protective clothing
and had to carry out their duties in unsatisfactory environmental conditions.
They said the masks provided did not filter out animal hair and dust from the
air and lab coats did not protect them against animal urine.
Lawyers added that there was no medical monitoring of employees and no medical
advice was given if staff developed symptoms of ill health.
The university failed to act on a recommendation that an inadequate ventilation
system be replaced in the 1980s.
One of the victims, Mr Phil Higgins, 44, worked as a university animal
technician at Stobhill Hospital. His job involved monitoring the effects of
heart drugs on animals. He has been unemployed for two years after leaving his
job because of ill health.
He criticised his employers for moving him to a job that involved work with
rabbits after it had been established that he was allergic to the animals.
Mr Higgins said: ``It started as hay fever but progressively got worse and
eventually became full-blown asthma. I gave them 27 years of loyal service and
then I was discarded.''
He admitted the four had some worries about publicising the case because of ``a
few crackpots'' but added that he had never experienced problems with animal
rights activists in the past.
Mr Jim Younger, 39, also gave up his job because of his condition and is now
unemployed. He had worked at the department of pharmacology at the Kelvingrove
campus for 22 years, where he bred and looked after animals used by medical
lecturers.
He said: ``I first began to experience breathing problems in the late seventies
and it gradually became worse. My doctor diagnosed asthma and said it was
probably caused by the animals I worked with. Now I've got asthma for life and
it could get worse.''
The personal injury lawyer representing the four, Mr Frank Maguire, said the
risks facing people working closely with animals had been known for more than a
century.
Mr Maguire said: ``Government officials carried out regular checks on the
welfare of the animals but nobody seemed to care about the conditions of the
humans who looked after them.''
He said the individual awards - which were based on pain and suffering, loss of
earnings, potential loss of earnings and the cost of care - were not being
disclosed at the request of those involved.
The legal action was backed by the Manufacturing, Science, and Finance union,
whose regional officer, Ms Carmen McAteer, told a news conference yesterday
that the case could lead to a number of similar legal challenges.
A university official said that staff training, health checks, and safety
equipment had been improved.
She added: ``The university deeply regrets the poor health of the four
laboratory technicians and is convinced that it is now doing all in its power
to ensure that current and future employees working with animals are protected
from the risks as far as possible.''
Mainstream animal welfare groups said the case proved that the shroud of
secrecy surrounding laboratory experiments should be lifted.
Mr John Robins, organising secretary of Animal Concern, said: ``It is time that
what goes on in labs is made clear. It is extremely rare for this sort of case
to be made public. These labs are very secretive but it is obvious that if
workers can't be cared for there is no knowing what happens to the animals.''
Mr Les Ward, director of Advocates for Animals, said that the risk of reprisals
from hardliners was slim. He said: ``We would condemn any action against the
individuals but the fears of the scientific community are exaggerated.''

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton intervened in the Bosnian peace talks last night,
telephoning Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to discuss territorial issues
that are stalling them.
One US official said it was understood that two of the three Balkan presidents
involved in the talks had planned to leave Dayton, Ohio, where the summit was
taking place.
However, Mr Clinton stepped in, calling Mr Tudjman as the US-led negotiating
effort was reported to be on the verge of collapse.
Bosnian Serbs were accusing Mr Tudjman of trying to destroy the talks by making
unrealistic and unreasonable demands about the return of a thin sliver of land
linking Serb territories in Bosnia, called the Brcko corridor.
The official said it would not be known if Mr Clinton ``succeeded until we get
the final word from Dayton''.
He said Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Bosnian President Alija
Izetbegovic were set to leave Dayton today, ``but I think there is a
possibility they are going to stay as well. The intention is to go beyond the
evening (with the negotiations) into the morning.''
The Americans tried to bring the talks to a conclusion by issuing a series of
ultimatums, but the three principals continue to argue.
The stalemate cannot continue forever. If a peace agreement is impossible, the
talks might adjourn, or a partial agreement may be announced with a new session
arranged to settle the rest. Otherwise, the fighting might start again.

A SEARCH for a climber missing in the Cairngorms was being resumed this morning
after being called off late last night.
More than 20 members of the Cairngorm and the RAF Kinloss mountain rescue teams
were joined yesterday by five sniffer dogs with their handlers and a Sea King
helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth in the hunt for the man, who should have come
down on Sunday evening.
Plumber William MacDonald, 44, of Falkirk, was reported missing by his wife
yesterday morning when he had not returned as planned from a climb in Glen
Einich, in the western part of the mountain range.
Last night, fading light forced the helicopter to return to base, the rescuers
on the ground searched on into the darkness.
Mr MacDonald, who has four year's climbing experience, was well equipped for a
day's climbing and was carrying food and a small tent.
Searchers found his car around noon, parked near a gliding airstrip in
Glenfeshie, six miles south-east of Kingussie.
Police believe Mr MacDonald intended to climb both 3338ft Mulloch Clach a
Bhlair and 3658ft Sgor Gaoith, which has 1500ft rocky crags towering above Glen
Einich.
Last night, as winds in driving rain gusted to gale force, a police spokesman
voiced his concerns for the missing man's safety.
Inspector Colin MacKintosh, who is co-ordinating the search from Aviemore
police station, said: ``The prospect of having someone out in this weather for
a second night is obviously a great source of worry.
``We never give up hope in cases like this. If he has dug in, then there is
still a chance that we could find him safe and well.''

A CROWN Office legal blunder has meant two cashiers being found not guilty of
embezzling almost #600,000 with virtually no evidence being presented, and
brought angry criticism from a legal firm.
The Aberdeen firm of Storie, Cruden, and Simpson, for whom the two women worked
and from whom the money was allegedly taken, said: ``We understand that the
prosecution of our former cashiers has been lost by the Crown because of its
failure to secure the admission of certain essential productions due to a
technicality.
``The partners of this firm are appalled by the manner in which the Crown
Office has seen fit to prosecute the case which has singularly failed to serve
the ends of justice.''
The case ended before any key evidence could be heard because the Crown had, in
the view of the sheriff, failed to have bank statements crucial to the case
certified under the appropriate Act.
Mrs Eleanor Masson, 62, of Burnieboozle Crescent, Aberdeen, and Mrs Doreen
Cruickshank, 55, Gordon Court, Newmachar, had denied embezzlement which was
alleged to have occurred between January 22, 1982, and February 22, 1991.
A total of #572,778.36 was alleged to have been taken, in amounts ranging from
#30.91 to #20,656.74.
Although the case started on November 9, most of it was taken up with legal
argument.
Mrs Cruickshank said she was delighted that, after almost five years, she had
now been cleared. She said she wanted to thank her family friends and
neighbours who had supported her through these ``absurd proceedings''. Both
women had ceased to be employed by the firm within days of a Law Society audit.
After only 10 minutes of evidence by Mr James Mathieson, an accountant
appointed by the Law Society, Mr Herbert Kerrigan QC, defending Mrs Masson,
objected to bank statements being lodged as productions on the grounds that
they had been certified under the Prisoners and Criminal Procedures (Scotland)
Act 1993 as opposed to the Bankers Books Evidence Act 1879 which took
precedence.
Sheriff Kenneth Forbes ruled that the Crown's certification was inappropriate
and therefore the statements could not be lodged.
Depute-fiscal Sandy Hutchison then sought to have crucial productions,
amounting to around 10,000 pages, taken for certification under the Bankers
Books Evidence Act 1879. The sheriff also refused that motion.
The Crown's case finally fell yesterday when the sheriff refused a motion to
desert the case ``pro loco et tempore''. This would have allowed the Crown to
bring a new indictment against the two former cashiers.
Mr Hutchison had also been seeking an extension to the 12-month time limit from
January 14 next year for a further three months to April 14. He said the Crown
took the view that Sheriff Forbes had erred in deciding that the documents had
not been certified appropriately.
Mr Kerrigan opposed both motions on the grounds that they were incompetent and
would be unjust and oppressive. ``What has happened here is simply that the
Crown did not proceed in a competent manner,'' he said.
The Crown would have avoided the situation if they had read the appropriate Act
of Parliament and not ancillary documents from which they now sought to take
comfort. It would be a ``most unfortunate exercise in discretion'' if the

THE Princess of Wales last night confessed on television to adultery, but
promised she would ``fight to the end'' for her royal role.
She admitted being unfaithful with former cavalry officer James Hewitt.
``Yes, I adored him. Yes, I was in love with him. But I was very let down,''
she said on the BBC1 Panorama programme.
The princess's confession, watched by an estimated 15 million people, mirrored
her estranged husband's admission on television last year that he had committed
adultery.
``Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded,'' the
princess said, referring to the Prince's close friend, Mrs Camilla Parker
Bowles.
She does not want a divorce but believes she will never be Queen and believes
the Establishment does not want her to be Queen.
During her unprecedented TV interview she said of herself: ``She won't go
quietly, that's the problem.''
The princess added: ``I'll fight to the end because I believe that I have a
role to fulfil, and I've got two children to bring up.''
At first she had ``desperately loved my husband'' and accepted the challenge of
``a fairy story that everybody wanted to work'', she said.
But she went on to talk of the time when she resorted to injuring herself in an
unsuccessful attempt to draw her husband's attention to her problems, and she
described her years of secret bulimic binge-eating.
``It was a symptom of what was going on in my marriage,'' she said. ``I was
crying out for help.'' But her husband did not understand, and she was
dismissed as ``mentally unbalanced'', she said.
She was ``devastated'' by her husband's TV admission of adultery. ``But then I
admired the honesty, because it takes a lot to do that.''
Then, 38 minutes into the interview, the princess spoke for the first time
about her relationship with Hewitt, which was described in the book Princess in
Love.
``He was a great friend of mine at a very difficult, yet another difficult
time, and he was always there to support me, and I was absolutely devastated
when this book appeared, because I trusted him, and because, again, I worried
about the reaction of my children.''
Interviewer Martin Bashir asked: ``Did your relationship go beyond a close
friendship?''
The princess replied: ``Yes it did, yes.''
``Were you unfaithful?''
``Yes, I adored him. Yes, I was in love with him. But I was very let down.''
The princess admitted having a telephone conversation with her friend James
Gilbey, the substance of which became known as the ``Squidgy tapes''.
``But the implications of that conversation were that we'd had an adulterous
relationship, which was not true.''
She believes the conversation was leaked to the press to harm her, and ``that
was the first time I'd experienced what it was like to be outside the net, so
to speak, and not be in the family.
``It was to make the public change their attitude towards me. It was, you know,
if we are going to divorce, my husband would hold more cards than I would - it
was very much a poker game, chess game.''
Asked whether she made nuisance phone calls to her art dealer friend Oliver
Hoare, the princess dismissed reports that she was responsible for 300 such
calls. Again it was ``a huge move to discredit me''.
She cast doubt on Charles's suitability to be King, hinting it might be better
for Prince William to succeed the Queen. In a key passage, she said being King,
or the ``top job, as I call it'', could be ``suffocating'' for Charles.
Asked if it was her wish that when William came of age he, rather than his
father, succeeded the Queen, she replied: ``My wish is that my husband finds
peace of mind, and from that follows others things, yes.''
She told of her ``difficult'' pregnancy with William. ``Then I was unwell with
post-natal depression, which no-one ever discusses . . . You'd wake up in the
morning feeling you didn't want to get out of bed, you felt misunderstood and
just very, very low in yourself.''
The princess, interviewed in secret at Kensington Palace, said she had never
suffered depression before.
Asked about reports that she had tried to injure herself, she said: ``I was
ashamed because I couldn't cope with the pressures . . . I just hurt my arms
and my legs.''
Charles did not understand, she said, but she felt ``compelled to perform'' as
the Princess of Wales, and suffered bulimia. ``I had bulimia for a number of
years. And that's like a secret disease. You inflict it upon yourself because
your self-esteem is at a low ebb, and you don't think you're worthy or
valuable.''
She went on: ``It was a symptom of what was going on in my marriage. I was
crying out for help.''
Asked whether she was aware of her husband's renewed relationship with Mrs
Parker Bowles, around 1986, the princess said: ``Yes I was, but I wasn't in a
position to do anything about it.''
What effect did it have? ``Pretty devastating. Rampant bulimia, if you can have
rampant bulimia, and just a feeling of being no good at anything and being
useless and hopeless and failed in every direction.''
She noticed a change in the prince's behaviour and knew that she had ``a
husband who loved someone else''.
Asked how life became difficult, she said her husband's friends ``were
indicating that I was again unstable, sick, and should be put in a home of some
sort in order to get better. I was almost an embarrassment.''
Did the prince hold such a view? ``Well, there's no better way to dismantle a
personality than to isolate it.''
She allowed her friends to speak to author Andrew Morton, whose book first
disclosed the unhappiness of her marriage.
``I was at the end of my tether. I was desperate. I think I was so fed up with
being seen as someone who was a basket-case, because I am a very strong
person.''
Once the public became aware of the state of her marriage, the situation became
intolerable and discussions began with lawyers about a separation.
The princess claimed that in 1993, after the separation, she was seen as ``a
problem . . . a liability'' by people around her.
Visits abroad were blocked. ``Everything changed after we separated.'' Who was
behind that change? ``Well, my husband's side were very busy stopping me.''
She believed a campaign was being waged against her. ``I was the separated wife
of the Prince of Wales, I was a problem . . .
``She won't go quietly, that's the problem. I'll fight to the end, because I
believe that I have a role to fulfil, and I've got two children to bring up.''
The princess disclosed that her decision to withdraw from public life came when
``the pressure was intolerable''.
She said it surprised ``them when I took myself out of the game. They hadn't
expected that. And I'm a great believer that you should always confuse the
enemy.''
Who was the enemy? ``Well, the enemy was my husband's department, because I
always got more publicity.''
The princess admitted in the interview: ``The fairy tale had come to an end.''

A GIRL who collapsed after taking drugs at a disco was released from hospital
yesterday.
Sharon Kay, 17, was taken to hospital after she slumped unconscious on Saturday
night when she is thought to have taken speed, a form of amphetamine.
She was taken to Perth Royal Infirmary where doctors worked through the night
to stabilise her. At one point they feared for her life.
She was placed in intensive care as her mother, Mary, stayed by her bed.
But yesterday Sharon, who works at a residential home in her village of of
Auchterarder in Perthshire, was released from hospital.
Her family were still too upset to speak last night.
Yesterday, a 36-year-old Perthshire man was arrested in connection with the
incident and is expected to appear in court today.
Sharon collapsed during a party at Club Five, George Street, Perth. Club
manager Tommy Ower described his shock at Saturday's events.
He said: ``It was a private function. This has come as a complete surprise.''
Club Five is a small club favoured by youngsters for its dance music and does
not have a reputation for being part of Perth's drug scene.
Youngsters attending raves take speed to keep them dancing all night. The drug
is notorious for being cut with talcum or baking soda as dealers try to get
more profits.

FOREIGN secretary Malcolm Rifkind last night headed off moves by some European
Union states to impose an oil embargo on the Nigerian military junta.
However, EU Foreign Ministers in Brussels did agree to an arms embargo and
halted development aid, which could cost Nigeria #180m by 1999.
The action against Nigeria follows the execution earlier this month of Ken
Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority rights activists. Nigeria would have been
the EU's biggest recipient of aid under the 10-year, #12bn Lome Convention
package agreed last month.
However, Ministers stopped short of imposing an oil embargo which would cripple
Nigeria's economy. They also decided not to freeze the personal assets of the
ruling Nigerians. However, they warned that ``further measures are under
consideration''.
Mr Rifkind said later: ``It would simply have been unwise to reach such a
conclusion without hearing the views of the United States, which takes up to
60% of Nigeria's oil exports.''
Netherlands, where Royal Dutch Shell has its international headquarters, backed
Mr Rifkind in resisting an oil embargo after complaints by the Swedes that
sanctions agreed so far were insufficient.
Sweden received some support from the German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.
Others supporting an oil embargo included Belgium, Luxembourg, Finland, and
Denmark.
However, the Irish played the role of mediators when deputy Foreign Minister
Gay Mitchell called only for an ``active review'' of oil sanctions. It was this
approach, supported by Mr Rifkind, which finally held sway.
EU Ministers will monitor the behaviour of members of Abacha's provisional
ruling council and federal executive committee, and their families who are now
disallowed visas to visit Europe.
Some exceptions in the list of sanctions will be allowed for projects involving
humanitarian aid, human rights, and democracy.
Oil accounts for 98% of Nigeria's export earnings but the country remains
vulnerable to an embargo because it produces less than 3% of the world's
consumption.

THERE is an urgent need to reduce the growing gap in premature deaths between
affluent and deprived communities in Lothian, a conference in Edinburgh was
told yesterday.
The region's director of public health, Dr Helen Zealley, said premature deaths
were more common in deprived areas and the gap had widened over the last 10
years.
A total of 279 additional people died before the age of 65 in deprived
communities in 1994, she said, and it was unlikely that Lothian Health would
achieve its target of reducing the gap by 25% by the year 2000 because of an
increase in deaths among the 15-44 age group in deprived communities.
Such gaps required to be addressed, she said, pointing out that Lothian
Health's primary care and community health strategy had already identified the
need to target services and support to deprived communities.
She added: ``Such investment by the NHS needs to be undertaken in partnership
with the communities themselves, with local authorities, schools, and many
other agencies, as well as voluntary groups.''
She called for renewed determination for all agencies to work together to
reduce the gap in premature deaths and, in particular, to meet the needs of
children and young people in deprived areas.
Dr Zealley said that in deprived areas, with homes cold because tenants were
unable to afford to heat them, the elderly and children could suffer. A poor
diet was another factor.

<HEADLINE>Prestwick set to land 200 jobs at air-traffic control</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID STEELE</BYLINE>

UP to 200 extra jobs will be created at a new air-traffic control centre at
Prestwick in the next five years.
While most of the jobs will be filled by controllers transferring from England,
the news is a welcome boost for the Ayrshire economy.
A number of ancillary jobs are also likely to be created, as is further
employment in the construction of the #200m centre.
The news comes as controversy continues over the Government's insistence on
having the centre built under the terms of the Private Finance Initiative.
One of three consortia will build the centre and then rent it back to National
Air Traffic Services (Nats).
The Government has stuck to its guns despite opposition from the Civil Aviation
Authority, trade unions, and MPs of all parties.
A new look for air-traffic control in the United Kingdom will emerge after the
year 2000 when new en-route centres at Prestwick and Swanwick in Hampshire are
operational.
About four years later, the Scottish and Oceanic control centre at Prestwick
will be replaced by a new facility. Three multi-national consortia, two headed
by US companies Hughes and Loral and one by French firm Thomson CSF, will
tender for the Prestwick contract.
Their bids have to be in by March next year and the contract will be awarded in
October with work expected to start by the end of 1996.
Mr Gordon Doggett, general manager of the #500m Swanwick centre said Prestwick
would have a ``crucial role'' to play in air-traffic control for the next
century.
The new jobs for Prestwick, which will increase the workforce to more than 600,
will come when the Manchester en-route centre closes and the bulk of the work
comes north.
Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley, said: ``I still
have serious reservations about the private finance initiative being used in
this way.
``I still think it is foolish of the Government to ignore the views of the
chairman of the CAA, whom they appointed, and other interested parties.
``But at least the centre is now to go ahead and should be completed on
schedule before there is any chance of air-traffic control services being
privatised.''

IT was anything but silence in court yesterday when a retired sea captain
demanded a noise abatement order on his neighbours' cockerels.
The normally hushed chambers reverberated to the sound of raucous screeches as
Mr Michael Bateman played a tape recording of the birds in full voice.
Mr Bateman, 67, won a rare legal action against their owner, Royal Navy
Commander Kenneth Ayres, but JP Mr Richard Dickson ruled that the problem with
the cockerels was not as serious as claimed.
He said he would be taking expert advice and make an order on how the problem
should be dealt with next Monday.
Dumbarton District Court heard that Mr Bateman used to own and live in a former
farmhouse in Glen Fruin, near Helensburgh.
When his family grew up and moved away, he and his wife, Marie, 63, converted a
barn into a retirement cottage and sold the main house to Mr Ayres, 53, who is
stationed at the nearby Clyde Submarine Base.
Mr Ayres and his wife, Julie, 53, introduced a variety of farmyard poultry and
fowls, including cockerels.
Mr Bateman told the court: ``They screech every day of the year for an average
of seven hours a day. The worst day was Thursday, August 17, when they were at
it non-stop for 14 hours. We have kept a diary and over the last 11 months we
haven't had a day without disturbance.
``The volume and persistence is intolerable.''
The courtroom was treated to a five-minute-long tape of cock-a-doodle-dooing,
which Mr Bateman said had been recorded on September 24.
He said: ``It's that noise that has driven us nuts for the past year. We can't
even sit out in our garden in the summer.''
Mrs Bateman said: ``We have even found ourselves sitting in the car in Balloch
Park to get some peace and quiet. I have to keep all the windows closed. Surely
we have a right to some peace?''
The couple's daughter, Kathlyn, 35, told how she could hear the cockerels every
time she phoned from her home in Edinburgh.
She added: ``I had a serious operation in July and went to stay with my parents
to recuperate, but it was no use. I couldn't even sit out in the garden.''
A family friend, Ms Margo Ross, said: ``I was brought up on a smallholding, but
the noise was nothing like what the Batemans are having to endure. The level is
horrendous.''
Mr Bateman admitted that when the main house was put on the market, it was
described by the estate agents as a ``traditional Scottish hill-sheep
farmhouse''.
But he claimed: ``It is patently obvious that it was not a suitable place for
the introduction and containment of persistently noisy farm animals.
``I sold it to Mr Ayres as a dwelling house and garden and for that purpose
alone.''
Mr Bateman agreed there was occasional animal noise from an adjacent field
during the lambing season, but added: ``It's nothing like the volume,
persistence, or shrillness of the cockerels.''
Mr Ayres told the court he had searched for more than a year to find a suitable
home in preparation for his retirement from the Navy next year.
He said: ``It suited us perfectly. My wife loves animals and we introduced
ducks, rabbits, a goose, dogs, cats, cockerels and an abandoned lamb.
``My wife has no children. The animals are her family. They all have names and
most of them respond - even some of the chickens.''
He added: ``We have had many people staying with us since we moved in and not
one of them has commented on the noise.
``Mr Bateman sold me a farmhouse. He chooses to live in a rural location and he
must accept the country noises that go with it.''
Giving evidence on Mr Ayres's behalf, Lieutenant Colonel David Nicol described
Mr Bateman as ``the biggest pain in the neck I know in the world''.
Mr Nicol, commandant of the Strone Army Training Camp adjacent to the property,
said: ``One of my biggest problems has been his persistent complaining. He has
even rung me in the early hours to complain.'' He added: ``Some of his
complaints have been justified - but many not.''
Mr Batemen replied: ``You almost set my house on fire when a flare landed on
it. And when I phoned you in the middle of the night it was because of noise
disturbance from gunfire and I thought `if I cannot sleep, then why should
you'.''
Mr Bateman raised his action under the Civic Government Act (Annoying Creatures
Provisions) which gives the court the power take any measure to stop the noise,
short of destroying the birds.
Mr Dickson made the 30-mile round trip from Dumbarton to Glen Fruin with Mr
Bateman and Mr Ayres to see and hear the cockerels for himself. The court was
reconvened in the disused farmyard and Mr Dickson pulled on his wellies for a
tour of the farm.
Back in court, Mrs Ayres said she had roosters called James and David and
bantams called Barato and Bonito. The ducks were Wee Lucas and Clara, while her
goose was called Obi Kenobi, after a character in the movie Star Wars.
She had rabbits called Bun-Bun and Boy Sue (who turned out to be a male after
she initially thought it was a female) and a pet sheep called Prue.
Mrs Ayres had recently established a branch of the SSPCA in Helensburgh.
Mr Dickson said: ``This has been an extremely difficult case to deal with. On
the balance of probability, it has been proved that there is reasonable
annoyance to the Batemans because the cockerels sometimes crow for long periods.
``However, I do not accept that it happens from dawn to dusk.
``I shall be making an order on how the problem shall be dealt with. But first
I shall seek expert advice so that the order is logical, practical, and
coherent.''
After the verdict, Mr Ayres said: ``I'd rather not make any comment until we
find out what course of action is to be taken.''
Mr Bateman said: ``I'm disappointed that the magistrate did not go as far as I
had hoped.''
He added: ``At the end of the day we will still have to live as neighbours. I
honestly bear Mr Ayres no ill-will, but we just cannot live with the noise.''

THE Royal Mail urged 750 striking postal workers in Edinburgh to return to work
today.
The workers walked out of eight delivery offices in the city to support
colleagues at Portobello, who stopped work in protest at Royal Mail introducing
new working practices on second deliveries.
The action was unofficial and was later repudiated by the Communication
Workers' Union.
The workers appeared to be in angry mood at a private meeting held in
Edinburgh's Restalrig area yesterday morning after the walk-out.
They agreed they would return to work today if the new procedure at Portobello
was withdrawn. Their divisional-level officials yesterday met Royal Mail
representatives for two hours to pursue the matter but both sides failed to
reach agreement.
A spokeswoman for Royal Mail said the stoppage had caused disruption at most
delivery offices in Edinburgh but the processing centre at the Gyle, the hub
for most east-coast mail had worked normally.
The new structure at Portobello, which affected four out of 23 second
deliveries, was to bring Edinburgh into line with the rest of the UK and
increase efficiency. It was not a threat to the second delivery, she said.
Last month, the CWU protested at Royal Mail plans to shed 300 full-time jobs in
the Scotland and Northern Ireland division by the end of March, and
negotiations are in progress. However, the union is balloting its 13,000
members in the division on industrial action, which could take place before
Christmas.
q.Mr John Keggie, the CWU's divisional officer, said yesterday that postal
workers at Hamilton would go on indefinite strike on Friday after voting 63-3
for industrial union in a ballot. In Hamilton, 25 second deliveries out of 70
had been removed by Royal Mail.

A MAN told yesterday how     he struggled to safety as two  friends died when
their car plunged into a rain-swollen river.
Mr James Gibson, 18, said there were no warning signs that a bridge had
collapsed.
Driver John Furay, 17, tried to brake when he saw the bridge was down.
The car went into a skid, crashed into concrete, then went into the Kelvin at
Garvell Bridge near Twechar.
Mr Gibson, of Differ Avenue, Twechar, said his other friend, Mr James
McClement, l7, was thrown into the back seat of the VW Polo, and the car began
to fill with water.
He told a fatal accident inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff Court that he tried to open
the door but the pressure of water kept it shut. Questioned by Mrs Margaret
Porter, leading the evidence, he said he finally managed to kick the door and
jumped out into the river.
He said: ``I was under the water but my feet touched the river bank and I
managed to crawl out.
``I was coughing up water and shouting `John' and `Jamie'.
``The last I saw of the car was the rear window as it was carried away in the
current.''
He told Mrs Porter he climbed over a fence and saw a car and asked the driver
to take him to get help for his friends.
He had to push-start the car, which had stalled in water on the road, and
called for help at a local hall.
His brother and father arrived later and took him home.
He was giving evidence at the inquiry into the deaths of Mr Furay, of The
Strone, St John's Way, and Mr McClement, of Kelvin Way, both Twechar.
Both drowned when the car went into the river on December 11 last year.
The inquiry heard that their bodies were recovered in the car two days later.
Mr Gibson said that, earlier that day, there had been extensive flooding caused
by incessant rain and he and his two friends had spent most of that Sunday in
their cars helping stranded motorists.
He said he had tried to cross the bridge in his own car about 2pm but after
getting through one large puddle saw a second one and decided to turn back.
He saw Mr Furay approaching the bridge and advised him to turn back but his
friend said he would try to get over.
About an hour later, he was with Mr McClement when they saw a police jeep with
flashing blue lights at the bridge.
Mr Gibson told Mrs Porter that later he was in the McClement house when Mr
Furay arrived and they decided to go and get petrol.
It was after 4pm and dark during this journey. Mr Furay said he would try to go
over the bridge and the tragedy happened.
Asked by Mrs Porter if there was anything he wanted investigated by the
inquiry, he said: ``Why were there no cones on the road? Why was nothing done?
Why was the road not blocked?''
He told his solicitor, Mr Fraser Simpson, that there was no warning sign that
the bridge was down.
Since the tragedy, he had not worked, and his personality had changed.
Earlier, Mr Henry Furay, 56, said his son, John, had passed his driving test on
July 26 last year and drove his mother's Polo.
He said he regularly checked the car and there were no faults when he drove it
four days before the accident.
Questioned by Mr Colin Sutherland, QC, for Strathclyde Police, he was asked
about the handbrake cord having broken and a faulty rear brake.
Mr Furay said that, on the Saturday night, his son had driven his two sisters
into Stirling and used the handbrake to park on a hill.
He said the faults therefore must have happened after the tragedy.
Both he and the other dead boy's father, Mr James McClement, 39, said they had
gone to the procurator-fiscal to ask for an inquiry into deaths of their sons.
Both said they wanted to know what had gone wrong that day and why there were
no warning cones on the road after the bridge collapsed.
Mr McClement said people had told him they had phoned the emergency services
but nothing was done.
The inquiry, before Sheriff Bruce Kerr, continues.

<HEADLINE>Man jailed for baseball bat murder is freed</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>6</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975273999</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A MAN who served eight years of a life sentence for murder was cleared and
freed by the Court of Appeal yesterday.
Lawyers for Mr Sam Hill said they would be seeking compensation for him as a
victim of a miscarriage of justice.
The court ruled that the judge at Hill's trial in 1988 did not properly direct
the jury on the question of identification and his conviction was therefore
``unsafe and unsatisfactory''.
Mr Hill, now 29, was convicted at Winchester Crown Court in December 1988 of
killing Mr Malcolm Barker by hitting him over the head with a baseball bat.
Mr Barker died during a late-night pitched battle between rival gangs on a
council estate in Bordon, Hampshire.
What became known as the ``Bordon Baseball Bat Murder'' case was taken up by
the BBC's Rough Justice team which obtained a statement from Mr Hill's best
friend, Mr Dave Smith, that it was he who struck the fatal blow in self-defence.
Mr Smith repeated his story at Mr Hill's first appeal in May 1993 but the
judges at that hearing did not believe him.
The case was later referred back to the court by the Home Secretary in the
light of fresh and previously undisclosed evidence.
Today, after hearing just one of those grounds, three judges quashed the
conviction and ordered Mr Hill's release.
Lord Justice Otton, sitting with Mr Justice Holland and Mr Justice Sachs, said:
``We have come to the conclusion that the direction on identification was
inadequate so as to amount to a material irregularity.''
The judges will give full reasons for their decision at a later date.
Since Mr Hill's conviction, the law requires judges to direct jurors on the
dangers of accepting evidence from witnesses who, although genuine, might have
been mistaken in their recollection.
Mr Hill's counsel, Mr Michael Mansfield QC, said Mr Hill did not wish to put
forward his other grounds of appeal.
``He does not wish to put the families of all concerned - his own family, the
Smith family, and the Barker family - through any more stress.''
As he walked free, quietly-spoken Mr Hill hugged his friend, Mr Smith, and said
he was ``delighted'' to be out.
``I don't really feel any anger. It's just a pity it has taken so long,'' he
said.
Mr Smith said: ``He should never have spent nearly eight years in jail. He
served time for something I admitted.''
Mr Hill's mother, Mrs Ann Hill, said: ``It's the best thing that's happened to
us in eight years. Now we can have a really great Christmas.''
She said the family would be leaving their home at Whitehill, Bordon, to begin
a new life elsewhere.
Rough Justice presenter John Ware said police and the prosecution now had some
very serious questions to answer.
``Had the police investigated this case properly in the first place, Sam Hill
would never have been charged with murder.''

A BOY and a girl, both aged 15 and in the same class at school, have died from
meningitis, bringing to five the number of deaths from the disease in Lincoln
in the past seven weeks.
Pupils and staff at the City School will be given antibiotics and swab tests
today to determine more about the virus. A 40-year-old man is being treated in
Lincoln hospital for the disease.
Lesson unlearned
A BURGLAR awarded #4000 damages after being shot by pensioner Ted Newbery on
his allotment was jailed for two years yesterday for attempting to burgle
another pensioner of 78. The judge told unemployed Mark Revill, 29, that what
happened on the first occasion was his own fault and added: ``Obviously you
haven't learned your lesson.''
Rape charge

<RECORDNO>975274004</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
CONCERN is mounting that the Government is preparing to effectively freeze
council building programmes throughout Scotland while recommending councils
look for private-sector funding.
There is particular concern in the Highlands where demand for new or improved
schools is growing at the same time that new road projects are postponed
through funding constraints.
The Scottish Office last night denied the freeze. Yesterday, the Highland
Council convener, Mr Peter Peacock, and vice-convener David Green said they
would raise the matter with Scottish Office Minister George Kynoch next week.
The prospect of the spending moratorium follows the Government's decision to
reduce substantially funding for the day-to-day operation of councils. The
Highland Council could face a shortfall of up to #30m which could only be paid
for by service cuts or council tax increases of up to 100%.
Councillor Green, who also chairs the council's budget working group, said the
Scottish Office usually advised councils of their guideline capital spending
allocations about this time of year.
This information had not been forthcoming and the indications given to council
leaders were that there would be no provisional capital allocations for the new
financial year.
``What it could mean, is that once our 1995-96 budget is spent and our
unavoidable commitments carrying into 1996 are met, we will be forced to impose
a moratorium on building projects unless we can change the Government's mind,''
Mr Green said.
``Eagerly awaited school projects could be shelved and the repair of our
schools will be further delayed. Our important road building programme will be
halted in its tracks.
``This is bad news for the council, council tax payers, and for our economy,
because a whole network of contractors and suppliers throughout the Highlands
could suffer from the loss of important work.''
Mr Green said the council intends to lobby hard on the issue and is seeking the
support of the Highland community in its campaign.
Councillor Peacock echoed Mr Green's concerns by saying: ``Because of the
controls Government has on our spending, local democracy is being eroded by
withholding the monies councils require to provide the level of services that
the community want and expect.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said: ``The level of legal commitments inherited by
the new authorities will limit the amount of money Ministers have to respond to
new pressures. But there is no moratorium on new capital prospects. Authorities
should consider private-sector funding for future large capital projects.''
A spokesman for the council, however, told The Herald last night: ``It is all
very well to talk about private finance but there are no mechanisms in place
and it is widely recognised it would take a very long time to set them up. It
is more expensive and there is no evidence the private sector would be
interested in projects in rural areas apart from big undertakings like the Skye
bridge.''

<TEXT>
HOME Secretary Michael Howard's decision to delay a parole hearing for Joseph
Martin, once regarded as one of Britain's most dangerous criminals, has been
upheld by a High Court judge in London as ``reasonable and lawful''.
Following yesterday's ruling, the 62-year-old double killer can expect to spend
another three years in custody.
Martin has served nearly 30 years of a life sentence imposed in 1966 for the
shotgun murder of a dairy manager during a robbery in London. Previously, he
had been sentenced to six years for the manslaughter of a woman he shot as her
baby slept nearby.
In January, the Home Secretary accepted a Parole Board recommendation that an
``enormous improvement'' in his behaviour meant he was ready for transfer to an
open prison but that further consideration of parole should be delayed for two
years.
Mr Tim Owen, appearing for Martin, now at Maidstone Prison, Kent, argued it was
unfair and unreasonable of the Home Secretary to back the board's decision as
it meant the prisoner was bound to spend up to a further three years in prison.
This was despite his ``amazing transformation'' and the fact he had now served
10 years in excess of the 20-year ``tariff'' imposed for retribution and
deterrence.
Mr Justice Hidden said ``immense care'' was required in deciding when prisoners
should be released and it was impossible to say the Home Secretary had acted
irrationally or perversely.
During the earlier part of his imprisonment, Martin was often in trouble. He
became involved in several attempted escapes, including one from Durham's top
security E-wing in 1968 with Walter ``Angel Face'' Probyn and John McVicar.

<TEXT>
THE defence case in the marathon Maxwell trial ended yesterday with neither Mr
Ian Maxwell nor Mr Larry Trachtenberg calling any evidence.
Last week, Mr Kevin Maxwell ended a four-week stint in the witness box at the
Old Bailey defending himself against two charges of conspiracy to defraud
pension funds.
Yesterday, the 150th day of the trial, Mr Edmund Lawson QC, for Mr Ian Maxwell,
and Mr Michael Hill QC, for Mr Trachtenberg, each told the court they were
calling no evidence.
Lord Justice Phillips then told the jury that meant all the evidence had been
concluded and it was now time for final speeches.
They will begin today with Mr Alan Suckling QC, for the prosecution, followed
by counsel for all three accused.
After that, the judge warned the seven women and five men: ``I will need a
little time to prepare my summing up.''
Mr Kevin Maxwell, 36, denies conspiring with his father to defraud the pension
funds by misusing #100m worth of shares in the Israeli company Scitex. He, his
brother Ian, 39, and former Maxwell financial adviser Mr Trachtenberg, 42, deny
a similar charge relating to #22m worth of shares in another Israeli company,
Teva.
Prosecution alleges that, at the material time, the shares belonged to BIM
(Bishopsgate Investment Management, which administered the pension funds) and
were not for the Maxwells to sell or pledge.
The Crown claims that, in the months before Mr Robert Maxwell's death at sea in
November, 1991, he and Kevin sold the Scitex shares to pay Maxwell company
debts.
The prosecution further claims that, in the days after the tycoon's death, the
accused pledged the Teva shares as security for a loan to try to prop up the
collapsing empire.
Mr Kevin Maxwell has told the jury that he believed the ownership of the shares
had been transferred from BIM to the Robert Maxwell Group and that therefore he
had been acting honestly and in what he believed was the best interests of the
group.
The trial continues today.

DOUNREAY'S management is preparing a lobbying offensive aimed at winning votes
in the referendum on foreign reprocessing next month but refuses to contribute
to the #10,000 costs of the vote, the Caithness Against Nuclear Dumping (Cand)
group claimed yesterday.
The UK Atomic Energy Authority at Dounreay, however, insists it is not
lobbying, rather it is communicating with the people of Caithness and argues
that the referendum is rushed and potentially damaging to Dounreay's interests.
Cand launched a public appeal earlier this month to pay for a Caithness-wide
referendum and has raised more than #8000 towards commissioning the independent
Electoral Reform Ballot Services to organise the vote.
The group said yesterday: ``Management at Dounreay have consistently opposed
the idea that people in Caithness should have any say at all in whether or not
waste from foreign research reactors should be brought to the area for
reprocessing.
Waste from the process may stay in Caithness permanently but the proposal could
bring 25 full-time jobs to the area.
``While refusing to help in any way with the funding of the referendum,
Dounreay telephoned Cand today to find out exactly when ballot papers will be
issued in order to maximise the timing of a proposed propaganda drive, funded
by the taxpayer.
"Unfortunately, as arrangements have not been finalised, it has not been
possible to give a definite date, though ballot papers are expected to be
issued within the next two weeks.''
Cand secretary Marjory MacKenzie, said yesterday: ``We have mixed feelings
about Dounreay's propaganda exercise. On the one hand they are perfectly
entitled to do any lobbying they want, and this at least shows they are taking
the referendum very seriously indeed.''
Meanwhile, the question that will be put in the referendum has now been agreed
with Electoral Reform Ballot Services. Everyone on the electoral roll in
Caithness will be asked, in a postal ballot, to answer yes or no to: ``The
United States of America is due to make a decision soon on what should happen
to nuclear fuel elements it supplied to research reactors in 33 different
countries.
``One suggestion is that many of the used nuclear fuel elements should be
brought from abroad to Dounreay for reprocessing. Are you in favour of this
proposal?''
The AEA's spokesman at Dounreay, Mr Ian Shepherd, said yesterday: ``What we are
planning to do is to remind the people of Caithness of the importance of this
commercial reprocessing currently under discussion.
I wouldn't call it lobbying. This is nothing new, we have been communicating
with the local population for many months.
``This whole exercise of the referendum has been rushed without giving the
people in Caithness the opportunity to consider the matter in any depth. There
is a danger that Cand and their backers will damage the interests of Dounreay
by rushing this vote. We are particularly keen to counter the disinformation
issued by Greenpeace last week over the waste from reprocessing being left at
Dounreay. That just isn't true.
``We think there are very good reasons why local people should vote in favour
of this commercial reprocessing. This is work we have been doing for over 30
years and now there is the possibility of it earning Dounreay #10m a year,
money which would work through the north Highland economy and help sustain and
protect employment here.''

A WOMAN posing as building society manageress Carol Wardell rang senior

an apparent robbery, a court heard yesterday.
The woman phoned the head office of the Woolwich Building Society to report a
stranger hanging around the branch Mrs Wardell managed in Nuneaton,
Warwickshire.
Customer relations controller David Smith told Oxford Crown Court the woman,
who introduced herself as ``Mrs Wardell'', asked his advice about security and
whether she should call police.
Mr Smith, who had never met Mrs Wardell, went on holiday and learned of her
murder only two weeks later.
He told the jury he then ``gradually realised'' Mrs Wardell, or someone
purporting to be her, had rung him a fortnight earlier.
After watching training videos featuring Mrs Wardell, he confirmed hers was not
the voice he heard in the four-minute phone call.
Mr Smith was giving evidence on the third day of the trial of Mrs Wardell's
husband Gordon, 42. He denies murdering his 39-year-old wife at their home in
Bonneville Close, Meriden, Warwickshire, on September 11 last year before
faking a raid at her building society to make it look as though she had been
killed by robbers.
Mr Smith, who worked at the society's headquarters in Bexleyheath, Kent,
described the phone call which he received at 12.10pm on September 8.
He said: ``She introduced herself as Mrs Wardell from Nuneaton. She went on to
say she was worried about the fact that someone was hanging around outside the
front of the branch and was worried about security and the public relations
aspect of reporting it.
``I told her, `Don't worry about that. The security of yourself and the staff
is the most important thing. Ring the police and don't worry.'''
He added: ``I told a colleague about the phone call as it was so unusual. I
deal with customer complaints and had never known anybody to ask me about
security.
``I would have expected an experienced manageress to call the local police
station to report their suspicions but if they were in doubt there were plenty
of people at our fraud and security department who could have helped down the
phone.''
He said he spent several hours studying two videos of Mrs Wardell's training in
sales methods.
He added: ``It was a different voice. Mrs Wardell's voice on the training video
had a West Midlands twang to it. She had a slight accent, quite a high voice on
occasions and a bit of a nasal twang.
``The person on the phone had a very well modulated voice with not a trace of
accent I can remember.
``They were very, very calm which I thought was unusual for someone ringing up
in that situation. They might have been a little bit excited about someone
hanging round outside the office.''
The trial continues.

IMPROVEMENTS in the performance of fourth year secondary school pupils in
Standard Grade examinations were praised yesterday by Mr Raymond Robertson, the
Scottish Office Minister for Education.
Speaking at the launch of this year's report on the performance of pupils in
Standard Grade, Higher, and Certificate of Sixth Year Studies exams, he
expressed delight at the increase in the proportion of pupils achieving three
or more awards at the end of fourth year.
The two-year Standard Grade course has replaced the O Grade as the
nationally-recognised leaving qualification for 16-year-olds. Each subject has
a balance of classroom-based assessment, carried out by the teacher, and
external exams.
In this year's tables, the unit of comparison has been raised from three to
five Standard Grades to take account of rising standards.
Although the number of presentations per pupil has remained fairly stable, the
proportion of fourth year pupils gaining five or more awards at the top, credit
level has increased by 4%. And 51% of young people now gain five or more
Standard Grades at the top three levels.
The percentage of pupils gaining one, two, or five Highers in fifth year has
remained stable over the past year but the Minister said: ``There has been a
steady rise in presentations and I look forward to seeing the success at
Standard Grade credit awards coming through to Higher Grade in the future.''
A heated debate about standards and whether they were falling followed
publication of English GCSE and A Level results after they showed that pupils
were gaining better awards.
However, Mr Robertson saw no reason for such a debate in Scotland. ``I am
convinced that standards are not falling,'' he said. The senior chief inspector
of schools, Mr Nisbet Gallacher, said exam results were compared from one year
to the next to monitor pupil performance.
``All this would suggest that the benchmark is right and that the improvement
is genuine, which we should all be extremely grateful for,'' he said.
Based on the performance of upper school pupils, Anderson High in Lerwick,
Shetland, had the best results of any local authority school in terms of
performance at fifth year, with 53% of pupils gaining three or more Highers.
Headteacher Ian Spence described the school's performance as a
``self-fulfilling prophecy'' and warned against reading too much into
``simplistic'' data.
Mr Robertson said that conclusions about the performance of a school should not
be reached on the basis of exam results alone. They should not be used to
stigmatise schools but they were useful in establishing if there was a problem
with a particular establishment.
They had played a part in Scottish education, avoiding the ``horror stories''
which had emerged in England and had resulted in the closure of a failing
inner-city school.
However, Mrs Helen Liddell, Labour's spokesman on Scottish education, said
publishing results in comparative tables was ``irresponsible, dangerous, and
meaningless''.
She said: ``We are committed to giving parents as much information as possible
but it must be valid and not misleading.''
Labour was involved in a wide-ranging consultation exercise to identify ways of
presenting schools' exam results which took account of their catchment areas
and the value they added to their pupils' education, she said.
Mr Ronnie Smith, general secretary of the main teachers' union, the Educational
Institute of Scotland, said Scottish Office health warnings about setting exam
results alongside other pointers to progress such as the quality of teaching
and learning ``should be emblazoned across the front cover'' of the report.
He called on the Scottish Office to look behind the bare facts to establish if
other factors such as class sizes contributed to exam performance. ``The report
is for parents but the vast majority will never pick it up,'' he said.
Mrs Judith Gillespie, convener of the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, said
examination results were important but publishing them nationally was not the
answer. School prospectuses were the place for such information, she said.

MORE than half of Britain observed the Armistice Day two-minute silence, it was
disclosed last night.
The Royal British Legion, which launched a nationwide campaign to bring back
remembrance at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, described the
response as ``outstanding''.
An opinion polldiscovered that 57% of people questioned observed the silence.
The poll by Audience Selection found 93% believed people should be given the
opportunity to observe it every year.
The legion, which launched the campaign in response to the public support for
the VE and VJ Day 50th anniversary commemorations, still has to decide whether
to make it an annual event.
Spokesman Jeremy Lillies said: ``Bearing in mind that we launched the campaign
at fairly short notice, it is an outstanding result.
``If we decide to go ahead and have it observed next year and in future years,
the support can only become greater.''
Sir Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the BBC Board of Governors, has already
admitted that in hindsight the BBC ``might have been wrong'' to ignore the
Armistice Day silence.
Following this year's campaign by the legion, many shops, banks, and members of
the public came to a halt on November 11.
The England football team, a Concorde flight, the Lord Mayor's Show in London,
and the National Lottery outlets were among those who stopped business in
silence at the allotted time.

THE Beatles first new single in 25 years got its first plays yesterday.
Free As A Bird, which is released for sale on December 4, is tipped to reach
the No 1 position in the Christmas charts.
The song is taken from a demo-tape made by John Lennon in 1977 - three years
before he was shot dead outside his apartment building in New York.
Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, gave the tape to Paul McCartney so that the three
surviving Beatles - McCartney, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison - could
complete it with backing tracks and harmonies.
The song is taken from a three double-CD set of Beatles music including
out-takes and other rarities.
Mr Neil Aspinall, Apple Corps chief, suggested at a launch yesterday that there
could be more to come. He said: ``Who knows what else Yoko may have in her
bottom drawer?''
The Anthology series of CDs were produced by ``fifth Beatle'' George Martin,
who produced all their previous material. But the new single was produced by
Jeff Lynne.
Mr Martin said yesterday: ``I think it's a great record. I think it's a super
song. I like the harmonies and I like the way the boys move it.
``Having heard it now, I wish I had produced it because it would have given me
30 No 1s instead of 29 because I like a nice round figure.
``It will be No 1 all over the world, there is no doubt about that.''
The record was sent out to radio stations from EMI's Abbey Road studios at 4am.
It had been kept under armed guard in Holland.
Bookmakers William Hill have made the single the 8-13 favourite to hold the
Christmas No 1 spot.
The song was played last night on an ITV preview of a six-part documentary,
also called Anthology, which is to be networked from Sunday night.
The Beatles Anthology was screened on the ABC network in the US on Sunday
night, to an audience of 50 million.
A spokesman for Paul McCartney said: ``That is a 28% share of the potential
audience which means it got a bigger share than the last Superbowl which only
got 25%, and people here are absolutely amazed.''
The first two-CD album Anthology 1 went on sale at midnight last night and
there have already been 600,000 advance orders, making it an immediate No 1.
Mr Martin went through out-takes and alternative takes of every Beatles
recording and TV appearances in a ``mix and match'' exercise which, he said,
gave a new insight into how the band worked.
Mr Martin addressed a news conference yesterday at London's Savoy Hotel
attended by around 1000 journalists.
He said: ``In some of these early takes there is a lot of charm. There are
wobbly bits but I was enthralled and it is a warts and all look at their music.
``We are a fly on the wall listening to the Beatles and I think people are
ready for it. They would not have been in 1970 or 1980, but I think they are
now.''
The three surviving Beatles also addressed the conference via a pre-recorded
video. In the video Paul McCartney quipped: ``We were a good little band.''
q The National Trust has bought a former council house where McCartney lived.
It is considered the home of the Beatles.
The terraced house, 20 Forthlin Road, Liverpool, which was McCartney's family
home for nine years, was purchased for an undisclosed price.
It is the most recently built property to be acquired by the trust - and the
first connected with the pop world.
McCartney said yesterday: ``My mum would have been dead chuffed to think our
little council house would end up with the National Trust.
``It's fantastic for me and our family.
``This house was the scene of many of the Beatles' formative years, such as
leaving for Hamburg, rehearsing, and writing songs. Sometimes we made quite a
noise and I hope it will be quieter now the National Trust has got it.''
He said he felt sorry for his neighbours who used to live next door to him in
the 1960s.
``I wouldn't have liked to live next door to me then.''
Many of the Beatles' early songs were written at the house - including their
first single, Love Me Do, and the first song on their first LP, I Saw Her
Standing There.
Liverpool City Council said the house was built in 1952.
The McCartneys - Paul, then 13, his brother Mike, father Jim and mother Mary -
moved to the house in the suburb of Allerton from a tough estate in Speke in
1955. They stayed there until 1964.
The house was sold to the trust by Sheila Jones, whose family bought it from
the council in 1980.

A SERIOUS national shortage of anaesthetists may result in longer waits for
routine surgery, according to a senior doctor at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness.
Dr John Machin, Raigmore's medical director, last week wrote to GPs throughout
the Highlands warning of the position.
Dr Machin said yesterday: ``The reputation of the hospital depends on our
recruiting only top-quality people with suitable accredited experience and we
are not prepared to compromise standards for the sake of overcoming what we
hope will be a short-term problem.
``Raigmore has repeatedly succeeded in recruiting excellent people in other
medical and surgical specialities despite national shortages, for example in
orthopaedics and sooner or later we are confident that the right people will be
found.''
Dr John May, consultant anaesthetist at Raigmore, said: ``There is a shortage
of high-quality accredited anaesthetists throughout the UK which inevitably has
had an impact on Raigmore.
``We have to make certain that accident and emergency admissions, mothers going
into labour, and patients with other urgent or potentially life-threatening
conditions who need surgery continue to get priority.''
Dr May confirmed that one staff grade and three senior house officer vacancies
remained at the hospital in addition to two consultant posts, one arising from
a consultant's retiral and one post which had been created to help reduce
junior doctors' hours.

A SCHEMING couple tricked a policeman into assisting a crude attempt to defraud
the National Lottery out of nearly #150,000, a court heard yesterday.
Constable Vincent Morley responded immediately when Fatima Quasein, 32, rushed
up to him and told him her winning lottery ticket had been chewed to pieces by
her two-year-old daughter.
The officer, from Stratford, east London, took her and her boyfriend, Ali
Hirli, 41, to his station, where he pieced the ripped ticket together and then
called lottery organisers Camelot on their behalf.
Prosecutor Mr Michael Holland said Mr Morley had no idea the ripped pieces came
from two tickets.
Giving evidence, Mr Morley told the jury: ``A lady approached me in a
distressed state with this torn ticket.
Mr Holland said the couple had dishonestly tried to dupe the National Lottery
by claiming they had won a second prize of #149,596.
Security checks showed they had simply joined together two tickets bought in
Plaistow High Street, east London, on the day of the draw and the day after.
The court heard that, in police interviews, the pair ``blamed each other''.
Moroccan Quasein allegedly said: ``Hirli is my boyfriend and he made me do it.''
However, she insisted her child had chewed a winning lottery ticket.
Turkish-born Hirli denied any knowledge of the con.
Quasein, of East Ham, and Hirli, of Tottenham, both London, deny attempting to
defraud the National Lottery on December 19 last year.

THE other evening, at a bank dinner in Edinburgh, I watched Labour's City
spokesman Alastair Darling being gently grilled. No, Darling wasn't the main
course. But, doubtless, every time he dons black tie and engages with money
movers across the smoked salmon and venison filet, Darling faces the same
question. At what level is Labour going to pitch its promised national minimum
wage?
Because he was speaking in Scotland on this occasion, there were also some
sceptical digs about Labour's commitment to a home rule parliament with limited
taxation powers. But the minimum wage was what seemed to get most of his
audience fired up.
In answering, Darling trod a familiar path. Too early to decide the level.
Extensive consultation about the eventual rate and about how it will be phased
in. Having failed to extract a figure from him, some in the audience opted for
a different tack. Then tell us the principle on which the figure will be fixed,
they demanded.
As the inconclusive exchanges wore on, Labour's City spokesman did actually
touch, once or twice, on a principled justification for a national minimum
wage. I paraphrase: ``It is not right that we, as taxpayers, should be
expected, through the welfare system, to subsidise employers who pay their
workers such low wages as to leave them dependent on benefit payments to make
ends meet.'' But, for the most part, Darling stuck instead to New Labour's
straight - and rather dead - bat which greets almost all attempts to sneak
precise policy commitments from the Blair bandwagon.
Two days before, as it happens, I had been pressing Scotland's industry
minister George Kynoch on much the same point. He had been warning that
Labour's commitment to a minimum wage and the social chapter of the Maastricht
Treaty would destroy jobs by the million and chase away inward investors, like
the Chunghwa Picture Tube Company, who were just about to unveil 3300 jobs for
Lanarkshire.
By setting such hares running, was the minister, in effect, conceding that many
of the jobs inward investors bring are paid at rates below the #4.15 an hour
the unions want Labour to set as the national minimum? Kynoch blustered - not
entirely convincingly - that our electronics industry is heading for ``a
singificant quantity'' of high skilled, high paid jobs.
But the minister can't have it both ways. A national minimum wage around the #4
an hour mark is only a threat to investment and jobs if these companies and
their suppliers pay a significant proportion of their people below that level.
If everyone gets paid above that level, where's the threat?
All the Government's euphemistic talk of creating a more flexible labour market
in the United Kingdom by refusing to sign up for the social chapter and
eschewing minimum wage legislation implies a willingness to see this country
become the haven in Europe for relatively low-paid work. It also implies,
unless there is a long-term plan to cut the real living standards of the
poorest sections of working people in this country, a willingness to see the
burgeoning state welfare budget used to subsidise such low pay.
There may be a market principle in that stance - that labour, like any other
commodity in our society, must be allowed to price itself into demand. But, in
the use of anodyne ministerial epithets like flexible, it is a principle which,
most of the time, dare not speak its name.
In general, our politicians are becoming more and more shy of any talk of
principle. With the near death of ideology and the progressive blurring of
party divides, the talk is more of gritty priorities than principles. But I,
for one, am not convinced that modern politicians are even capable of
translating such priorities as they come up with into decisively fresh
programmes of action.
Any government inherits such a massive edifice of established legislation,
programmes and practice, that setting new priorities all too often descends
into tinkering round the edges. For example, Chunghwa, it is widely reported,
will get upwards of #80m in state aid towards their #260m Mossend plant. That
is nearly three times the #27m annual capital allocation to Strathclyde region
for all its 1200 primary and secondary schools.
I know all the arguments about Scotland having a surfeit of school places. But
the environment in which our children learn does actually matter and investment
at that miserable rate barely keeps the roofs from leaking.
Do the politicians, or their advisers, ever revisit established priorities at
that macro level and ask what they tell us about our commitment to the basic
skills of future generations versus, in this case, the instant make-work lure
of a large inward investment? I doubt it.
The debate is far more likely to be about whether indigenous companies get as
good a deal on regional selective assistance as incomers and, in a totally
separate policy box, whether Strathclyde gets its fair share of educational
borrowing consent, compared with other Scottish regions.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown's latest proposals for personal taxation do have
the whiff of principle about them, when taken together with his contentious
carrot-and-stick approach to encouraging the young unemployed back into work.
He does seem to be wrestling with the interaction of the tax and welfare
systems, the territory where marginal tax rates can be penal and the unemployed
are all-too-often no better off going into low-paid employment.
Up until now conventional wisdom, including the findings of Labour's own Social
Justice Commission, has suggested that the best way to ease the poverty trap is
to take many more people out of tax altogether by raising thresholds
dramatically. Brown now prefers to trail the carrot of a 10p lower rate on
income tax which, were it in force today, would be payable by anyone with
taxable earnings above #67.79 a week.
I have searched diligently for the principle behind that priority. All I can
find is Will Hutton's comment in The Guardian that, compared with raising
thresholds, this is ``more eye-catching''. Sadly, the eyes have it.

ANY regrets Colin Powell might have suffered in finally deciding to by-pass
next year's scramble for the White House must have vanished in seconds last
week when it became evident that the politics of pique are now a determining
factor in America.
With damning recklessness Newt Gingrich, Republican Speaker of the House of
Representatives, let slip before the press that he had provoked the recent
confrontation between President Clinton and Congress because he considered the
Administration had snubbed Bob Dole and himself during the journey to and from
the Rabin funeral.
``That's part of why you (the people) ended up with us sending down a tougher
bill than was expected. It's petty but I think it's human.'' Well, Bill Clinton
could not have received a better iron tonic for his winter ratings. Whatever
the final outcome of the partial government shut-down, caused by this rumpus
between Republicans and Democrats, the country now knows principle had little
to do with it - this was a fight about revenge.
But here, too, are the peevish antics of meglomania. Gingrich's ego is now so
contorted it blocked out any realisation on his part that by causing 800,000
federal government employees to be laid off, he might conceivably lose his
party at least that number of votes in the forthcoming Presidential election.
And why? Because he and Dole were directed to the back of the Air Force One
flight to Israel. Worse still, in Gingrich's mind, the two men were required to
exit by the aircraft's rear door.
``You just wonder where is their sense of manners?'' he whined to Washington
reporters. ``Where is their sense of courtesy?'' Earlier this year Hillary
Clinton might have asked those very same questions of Gingrich. As his mother
informed America, the Speaker thinks so highly of the First Lady he refers to
her in company as a bitch.
Clinton, himself no stranger to bullying sulks, has responded to Newt's ire
with righteous astonishment, neatly leaving abrasive contempt to his
presidential aides. ``If I genuinely hurt their feelings I'm really sorry, and
surprised,'' he told the press corps, adding that his bafflement was increased
because he had made a point of visiting Gingrich and Dole during the Israel
journey to thank them for accompanying him, and to say goodbye as they came in
to land at Washington. ``I don't understand it,'' he mused, ``but then I just
work here.''
The American commentator, Richard Reeves observes that General Powell looked
before leaping into the abyss of national politics, and he saw it was a
nut-house, ``a pit dug by men like Bill Clinton and Bob Dole who have trouble
remembering what they have said and done from one day to the next.'' It is also
something of a brimstone pulpit for Gingrich, the scheming and unprepossessing
redneck who now claims to hear ``the voices of demons'' when those who simply
oppose him seek to gain his fractured attention.
Whether he admits it or not, the presidency is Gingrich's consuming goal, and
for almost 35 years he has studied history's despots and enlightened leaders to
fashion himself into ``ruler'' material. His military stratagems and
business-management rhetoric are designed to distract from a singularly shifty
personality but they only exaggerate the egomania and his intimidating ability
to seize an emotive issue, like poverty or education, wrap theatrical outrage
around it and then sink the debate with his own bigoted agenda.
To the American people's credit they react to this dangerous arrogance and
cunning by keeping his popularity polls low. They know him to be rude,
unstatesmanlike, and dictatorial, yet none of this has reduced his influence
within the House, and what makes his eminence even more perplexing is that
Gingrich has only the most fragile hold on his own Georgia constituency.
Have those headlines which roared Newt's Tantrum and Cry-Baby Speaker blown his
presidential chances? If so, Bill Clinton is not necessarily secure in the
White House, for the public knows too that its President can be a figure of
volcanic self-pity when cornered or challenged. In an extraordinary Rolling
Stone interview some time ago, he ranted on about how he had: ``Not gotten one
damn bit of credit from the knee-jerk liberal press. I am sick and tired of it,
and you can put that in the damn article.''
Clinton versus Gingrich? Democrat versus Republican ..... If ever an
Independent's time was right, surely it is now. But Powell the wise, Powell the
mature, has decided he has better things to do. And that leaves only one
outsider prepared to lead America: a rich and flaky meddler called Ross Perot.

CROSS-fertilisation and contradic-tions are the delights of Dr Graham Tydeman's
show. On the wall above the Net surfers hunched over mice and screens, is
Tydeman's Finnish pine and yew sculpture Moment of Conception in which an
enormous sperm breaches the wall of the egg. Subtle it is not, but it is
exquisitely beautiful and in this hi-tech context, more thought-provoking than
it might be elsewhere.
Tydeman's work will be known to those who attended NVA's Sabotage event at
Tramway, where his Joe 90 chair with redundant, but functioning, medical
monitoring equipment was one of the highlights. His recycling of the tools of
his trade can be seen again here. Self-Portrait is assembled from thick sheets
of aluminium in layers drawn from a scan. A ``please touch'' notice encourages
viewers to rearrange the cross section of his head. There is more interactivity
with an untitled piece that involves turning a crank handle to open a skull to
reveal the inner self. Inside Every Old Crumbly used the same theme to more
disturbing effect.
The juxtaposition of disparate materials is a repeating theme. Natural
Childbirth has a wooden baby encased in a shell of surgical instruments.
Encapsulated places an adult head of drug capsules within similar surroundings.
Like the SSA show, which Cyberia put on the Internet, Tydeman's show can be
accessed from home, and that it is the aim of Cyberia's Alastair Hall (himself
a painter) to do that for every exhibition. There is a new show at the cafe
every month and December will see the Poland photographs of New Zealander Renee
Daku.

SCOTTISH officials are to protest to UK selectors over their failure to include
any Scots in Britain's team for the European cross-country championship at
Alnwick a week on Saturday.
Despite finishing third and fourth at Margate a week past Saturday, Robert
Quinn (Kilbarchan) and Steven Wylie (Cambuslang) were named only as reserves
for the six-strong squad.
Peter Carton, the SAF president, said yesterday that he and his colleagues are
disgusted, and would be writing a letter of strong protest to the British
federation. ``Margate was billed as the final trial, but we just wasted money
sending a team,'' said Carton.
One athlete chosen, John Brown, has yet to run this winter.
Quinn, a member of the UK World chamionship squad last year, and the man with
most cause for complaint, said: ``I've no real gripe over the individuals
selected, but it's not a level playing field for us - there was no chance to
race all the contenders - one trial was the English relay event which Scots
can't even enter.
``We were told Colin Jones ran well in the Mike Sully race - that he had beaten
Spencer Barden. Well Steve and I did the same thing a week later, yet were
ignored. Colin might have beaten both of us - but we never had the chance to
race him. The selection criteria was not tight enough - with no single official
trial, it just gave them licence to pick whoever they wanted if the right guys
were not at the front.''
Wales and England are represented on both the selection committee and the team
selected. Scotland are not.
q FORMER European hurdles champion Kriss Akabusi was accused yesterday of
indulging in vague innuendo ``with no specifics and not a shred of evidence,''
to promote a forthcoming book.
Akabusi, who retired at the end of 1993, was attacked by British Athletics
Federation chiefs after stating in a TV interview that the authorities had
turned a blind eye to the abuse of performance-enhancing drugs.
``Ben Johnson was an embarrassment for the sport - he got caught,'' said
Akabusi. ``But I'm sure he was not on his own. How others didn't get caught I
don't know. I didn't cheat, but in my time there were people who were able to
say to people in authority or looking after top meetings: `I am capable of
breaking a world record, but I don't want any form of embarrassment.' ''
Allegations of a similar nature have led to legal action by Scottish coach
Frank Dick against a Sunday newspaper and former sprinter Drew McMaster whose
performances may yet be struck as a consequence from the record books.
Sponsor
interest
A LEADING sports company is to consider backing the eight-stage
Edinburgh-to-Glasgow road race should the current sponsors decide not to
exercise their option to continue, writes Doug Gillon.
The 65-year-old race, won on Sunday by Leslie Deans Racing Club for a
record-equalling fifth successive year, has been supported for the past 17
winters by the soft drinks company, Barrs. But their latest five-year
agreement, worth #10,000, has now ended, prompting concerns by competitors
about the future of the event.
A spokesman for Mizuno, who back several races in England, but none in
Scotland, confirmed yesterday that if the race does become available, they
would be interested in looking at proposals from the Scottish Athletic
Federation's road and cross-country commission. The race, highlight of the
winter road season, involves the country's leading 20 teams, and is by
invitation only.
``We will be talking to Barrs in the near future,'' said SAF president Peter
Carton last night. ``We have enjoyed excellent relations with them over the
years, but this is an important event for the sport, and we want to secure its
future.
``The race would go ahead irrespective of sponsorship, but we would like to
maintain it in some style. It's very gratifying to learn that other companies
are prepared to put money into Scottish athletics.''

AMERICAN FOOTBALL
THE Dallas Cowboys bounced back from last week's surprise loss to San Francisco
by beating AFC favourites Raiders 34-21 in Oakland on Sunday.
Emmitt Smith rushed for three touchdowns to out-distance Dallas from a strong
Oakland team, underlining the NFC's continuing supremacy in the National
Football League.
Oakland were being touted as possible Superbowl contenders with hopes high as
both they and the Kansas City Chiefs would be able to match the might of Dallas
or San Francisco 49ers in Superbowl 30.
The Raiders were the last AFC team to lift a Superbowl title when they beat the
Washington Redskins 11 years ago. The loss dropped them to 8-3, two games
behind Kansas in the AFC West after the Chiefs won their seventh successive
game, 20-13 against Houston Oilers, propelling them to an NFL-best 10-1 record.
How well the chiefs can match up to the Cowboys will be seen this Thursday's
when they meet Dallas at Texas Stadium. Results:
NFL Week 12 - Arizona 7, Carolina 27; Buffalo 28, New York Jets 26; Dallas 34,
Oakland 21; Detroit 24, Chicago 17; Green Bay 31, Cleveland 20; Houston 13,
Kansas City 20; Indianapolis 24, New England 10; Jacksonville 16, Tampa Bay 17;
New Orleans 24, Minnesota 43; New York Giants 19, Philadelphia 28; Pittsburg
49, Cincinnati 31; St Lewis 6, Atlanta 31; San Deigo 27, Denver 30; Seattle 27,

WHO is the most influential writer and thinker on the art of management in the
last 50 years.
The prophet of excellence Tom Peters? . . . the father of quality W Edwards
Deming? . . . the apostle of competitive advantage Michael Porter?
Each has his advocates. To any list can be added the name of Peter Drucker . .
. and many would give it in number one position. Much of Drucker's influence
derives from his gift of being able to write for the manager rather than the
academic and that's a skill not shared by many writers on business.
For the past 50 years Drucker has demonstratedthe uncanny ability to anticipate
trends and describe them in a straightforward and readily understood way.
It was as long ago as the early 1950s that he told businesses to pay more
attention to their customers. In the `60s he warned us that we were about to
live in an ``age of discontinuity'' - how right he has proved to be.
On the basis of his track record, any new book by Drucker demands attention.
Can the grand old man of management thinking still cut the mustard? His latest
book is reviewed by Lex Gold, above, who recently stunned the Scottish business
world by announcing his resignation as Director of the Scottish CBI.I DON'T
like ``isms''. By their nature they confine ideas and concepts in the rigid
container of a general maxim.
Management ``isms'' in the wrong hands or minds can be dangerous. They are
often promoted by management ``gurus'' and I have never ceased to be amazed at
the way in which normally hard-nosed businessemen and women readily buy into
the latest management fashion.
It may have something to do with ``newness''. The idea that you are not a
switched on modern manager unless you exhibit a willingness to embrace the
latest ideas. Or it may even be the evangelical enthusiasm with which the ideas
are often promoted.
At the core of most management ``isms'' is a general truth. It is invariably
helpful to be reminded of, or introduced to, that most illusive of all
qualities, common sense. My beef is that too often management ``isms'' become
solutions looking for problems to solve. Dorothy Parker wrote that the only
``ism'' Hollywood believed in was plagiarism.
That is why Managing in a Time of Great Change* by Peter Drucker is so
refreshing. It contains a wide ranging sober and realistic analysis of present
and future challenges.
In one sense it could be viewed as a slightly bitty book bringing together as
it does, a group of his own original essays. But they have a common theme. They
all deal with change.
Because he has practised what he preaches and market tested his articles before
publication in this book, they have already been shown to have intellectual
rigour. The downside is that, with the pre-publication of the articles, some of
the ideas have already become common currency.
But it is Drucker's coherent and consistent analysis that forms the spine of
the book. It presents his management theories in the economic and social
context within which businesses operate and change occurs. Indeed, the chapters
on the economy and society form, for me, the most compelling part of the book.
Politicians should certainly read them.
Drucker asserts that we have been, and are, in a period of immense economic and
social change. The social upheavals of this century have ``transformed the
society and the economy, the community and polity in which we live''.
Knowledge is now the key to individual, corporate and national advancement.
Knowledge workers are, and therefore own, the tools of production.
The challenge for individuals is to keep refreshing their own knowledge; that
of managers to harness and combine individual talent, skills and knowledge to
create wealth; that for government is to control inflation, invest in education
and training, and encourage savings and investment.
Drucker argues powerfully and persuasively that the distinction between
domestic and the global economy has ceased to be economic reality. Increased
participation in the global economy has become the key to domestic and economic
growth and prosperity.
The two economics that have grown fastest in the world economy, Japan and
Korea, are also the countries with greatest growth in their domestic economy.
The same correlation applies to West Germany, the European country that did
best over the last 40 years.
The global economy is the engine of growth, prosperity and employment for every
developed country. Drucker claims that efforts by Government to improve their
domestic economies without regard to this truth are doomed to failure.
Politics and policies still centre on domestic issues in every country. But
making decisions without considering the potential impact on competitiveness,
Drucker believes to be flawed.
Drucker is also clear that ``the free market . . . does not by itself alone
build and sustain a functional society''. But he believes that all Governments
in the developed world have proved incompetent at solving social problems.
He asserts that welfare has not ended poverty but turned it into degradation
and dependence. He wishes to see welfare refocused on creating independence,
competence and responsibility.
Drucker also poses huge questions about citizenship. I found some difficulty
with his premise that volunteering for charitable work will provide the cement
of future citizenship.
But his analysis of the loss of community and shared social values and
interests in the developed world is chilling, as is the stark message about the
inability of countries to meet future welfare spending bills.
This book is not from an ``ism'' merchant. Drucker does not try to sell snake
oil. He poses more questions than answers but does not sit on the fence. he
spells out with clarity the directions that he believes individuals,
management, business and governments should take in our fast changing world.
Overall, this book is a very accessible work of broad scholarship.
*Managing in a Time of Great Change by Peter Drucker.
Book Review is compiled and edited by Stuart Paul of the University of Paisley.

Icing on
the cake
IJANE Asher is a lady with her fingers in many pies. Or should that be cakes?
If it's Tuesday, then it must be biscuits since she's hosting a reception in
Edinburgh's Balmoral Hotel to commemorate the 165th anniversary of McVitie's -
the biscuit company which began life as a baker and confectioner's shop in Rose
Street and which has long been responsible for the nation's favourite nibbles.
Asher has been involved with McVitie's for almost two years. This summer she
helped create not only two new biscuits - Coconutties and Scrunchies - but also
a frozen dessert called Elegance, which she describes as ``long and round, like
a gateau you'd buy at a patisserie, with white chocolate, Belgian chocolate and
brandy''.
Asher's role as McVitie's ``spokesperson and consultant'' is one of many jobs
she's taken on in her long, and extremely varied, career as ..... what,
exactly? Ask anyone who Jane Asher is, and her five-year stint (1963-1968) as
official girfriend to Paul McCartney is bound to be dredged up.
Way before she met McCartney, acting was her first love. She was acting from
the age of five - in theatre productions and in films like The Greengage Summer
(1961), Alfie (1966) and Henry the Eighth (1973). In the 1970s, disinclined to
pursue Hollywood roles, she opted to focus on theatre. While raising her three
children with cartoonist husband Gerald Scarfe during the 1980s and 1990s, her
acting attentions switched to television.
In 1981, Asher wrote her first book about cakes, and found that in the wake of
its success, shops were reproducing many of her ideas without crediting her.
Five years ago, she decided to set up in business herself and set up premises
in Chelsea for what has become Jane Asher Party Cakes.
Although she doesn't actually bake the cakes, she creates new recipes and
decorations at the shop rather than at home. The shop caters for functions at
London's top hotels, as well as for members of the royal family - an honour
Asher has in common with McVitie's, who supplied the 9ft-high cake for the
wedding of the Queen and Prince Philip.
Possibly Asher's most celebrated cake was one she made more than a decade ago
for the 40th birthday of a photographer friend. It featured 40 naked,
full-figured, fondant females, and - unsurpisingly - it still tops Asher's
best-seller list.
Writing is another Asher hobby which has been moving from the wings towards
centre-stage for some time. In addition to her popular party cake books (and
her own magazine), she has put together a fancy dress book; written several
children's books and a guide to child safety called Keep Your Baby Safe. At the
moment she is finishing her first novel (her 13th book). ``Publishers have
often said that I must have a novel in me, and I finally decided to try it.
Without giving too much away, it's about an obsessed woman and test-tube
babies.''
So what's next for the woman who seems to juggle at least three careers, family
life and a never-ending series of campaigns or petitions?
``I would love to do more theatre once the children are older. But I'm always
open to new ideas: life has taken me in some very unexpected directions.''

IT was a truly horrifying day down at the Arches last Saturday. The usual
cacophony of teenage shrieks were emanating from behind the walls of the Terror
experience, echoing round the vast stone vaults of the Arches' complex. The
screams added a bizarre chill to a comic mart which was taking place around the
bar area, with men competing to peddle tomes of visibly illustrated horror
stories.
The back arch was home to a bleak set of grey wood, more reminiscent of
scaffold than stage, designed by Graham Hunter and David Carter. A coffin-like
box was stranded on the floor, strewn with distressed banners. One ragged,
red-stained sign advertised the delights of Beheading A Lady, a claim which
presaged some alarm in this faint-hearted critic.
Just how scary are the surprises which director Andy Arnold promises for the
Arches Theatre Company's forthcoming production of Caligari, a drama which has
been inspired by the silent horror movie The Cabinet of Dr Caligari?
Arnold glanced at the banner and shook his head. ``Let's just say that there's
a lot left up to the imagination.'' He's not dependent on gore to create a
chilling experience but will invoke a haunting mood through chiaroscuro
lighting effects by Colin Proudfoot and an imposing musical score which has
been arranged by club gurus Orb Meikle and Stuart McMillan of Slam.
The score is one of the most interesting aspects of a fascinating project, the
result of a long-proposed collaboration between the Slam boys and the venue
which hosts their Friday night club. Don't be expecting pulsating beats from
the dance veterans though. The score is true to the atmosphere and period of
the piece and involves samples of Mozart and a particularly disquieting piece
of European fairground music which Arnold had fortuitously discovered in a
London record store.
The project has brought inevitable comparisons with the Arches' memorable
adaptation of another classic expressionist movie, Fritz Lang's Metropolis, but
in fact there are few parallels. The strongest similarity is the superficial
connection to silent cinema.
Whereas Metropolis was a large-scale promenade piece, which utilised a big gang
of volunteer performers, Caligari is a tightly constructed work played to a
seated audience, Arnold rejecting an original notion to move the audience round
sets in favour of establishing a more controlled claustrophobia. The story is
alternatively set in a fair and an asylum, and a captive audience enhances the
sense of inevitable voyeurism of watching sideshow freaks and lunatics.
Judging from a run-through Arnold has focused on that freakish atmosphere. Even
without the essential atmospheric lighting and musical effects it's a startling
show.
It's deeply creepy and almost hypnotic with very stylised performances, from
the balletic languor of the extraordinary Derek McLuckie - who last terrorised
audiences as the mad brother in the Arches' production of Arsenic and Old Lace
at the Citizens' Theatre - as the fortune-telling somnambulist Cesare, to the
clipped, understated portrayal of the manipulative Caligari by Grant Smeaton.
His simple snarling announcement: ``My name is Caligari and I have an exhibit
which is rare around these parts,'' instantly froze my blood.
Arnold's long-term collaborator, Andrew Dallmeyer, has opted for a less-is-more
approach to creating a script from the silent film, exacerbating the
stylisation with the use of blank verse, which effectively adds to the air of
unreality of this disturbing tale.
The budget is similar to that of Metropolis - ie Arnold is once again
exercising his skill at putting on first-rate work on little more than a wing
and a prayer - but Arnold describes the production as less of an ordeal: ``As
it's more contained and small-scale a #2000 budget is a relative luxury.''
Arnold describes his motivation for staging the piece as no more complicated
than ``simply wanting to do it'', rejecting any notion that it represents an
Arches approach to pulling young and new audiences. While other Scottish
theatres have been staging adaptations of classic and cult novels to this end,
he insists that Metropolis and Caligari do not represent any policy of
exploiting an interest in film.
While researching the script Dallmeyer was fascinated by the fact that the film
was written during a period when Europe was in the grip of sleeping sickness,
with more than 5,000,000 somnambulists in hospitals and asylums - a fact
explicitly referred to by Caligari in the play - but for Arnold the fascination
with the piece lies in the strength of the narrative.
HE says: ``It's a straightforward horror story. We've kept it simple. Caligari
wants to control people and has theories about genetic perfection but we've
avoided making connections between him and Hitler.''
What he does find compulsively interesting is the story of the background to
the film. ``It was written by the young Czech poet Hans Janowitz and the
Austrian theatre director Karl Mayer and was inspired by something which
happened to Janowitz.
``He had been following a young woman he liked the look of around a fairground
when she disappeared. While he was searching for her a weird-looking man
suddenly came out of some bushes. The next day Janowitz read in the newspaper
that a young girl had been found murdered in the bushes at the fairground. He
went to her funeral and thought he saw the man from the bushes staring
menacingly at him. Cesare was based on this sinister character.''
Such spooky inception has possibly left a legacy of the story. Even in an age
of prodigious gore and splatter, its horror still withstands. See it if you
dare, but take someone to hold your hand.
n.Caligari, The Arches, tomorrow until December 9.

NOTHING in golf, it seems, is safe any more from the world of commerce, not
even the bottom of the hole.
Last week at Bathgate as my ball fell in at the first it made a disconcerting
rattling noise. The immediate reaction was to retrieve the dimpled sphere as
quickly as possible for fear it was going to spring back out. Closer inspection
revealed a kind of plastic doughnut, through which the pin could pass,
displaying an advertiser's name - an underground sales pitch if ever there was
one.
Tasmania Wines and the Turkish Tourist Office are among those who have chosen
to target that 4!f-inch diameter, minimum four-inch deep cylindrical shape
which golfers pursue so obsessively. It's getting to the stage that it might be
easier to avoid advertising at Picadilly Circus than it is on the golf course.
As you approach the first tee, a board is likely to tell you the name of the
company sponsoring the entire hole. Your tee peg might well have a name printed
along the stem, and there is a good chance your ball will have a logo thereon,
as will your ball-marker when you reach the green. The flag may bear the name
of a product or service and now, when you pick the ball out of the hole, you
are urged to buy strong drink and take a trip to Turkey.
It seems that 575 clubs in the UK, 109 in Scotland, are involved in this ploy
which has been run for the last two years by Golf Media of Kent who offer local
or national packages in blocks of a month at a time. For suffering the rattle
18 times in a round clubs receive 20% of the advertising revenue, with a new
set of hole-liners thrown in.
Many might prefer the traditional clunk of ball on unsponsored metal, a sound
which has a much more satisfying air of finality about it, but if a mildly
irritating sound is the price of helping to keep subs down or contributing to
course development then perhaps it should be tolerated - along with all the
rest of it.
This latest stratagem has worrying potential. It is technologically possible
that a ball dropping into a hole could trigger a recorded message. Perish the
thought.
The next step is to reach for a sponsored scorecard upon which you will write a
figure with a pencil bearing another advertiser's name. The competition you are
playing in will probably be endorsed by a national company, and when an
incident arises you will reach for your copy of the Rules of Golf, brought to
you since 1908 by Royal Insurance and claimed to be the longest continuous
sport sponsorship in the world. There is no escape.
The most useful function any of the items in the above inventory perform, as
far as I can make out, is the freebee ball which assists in identification
under Rule 6-5 - except on the company day in question when everyone is likely
to be playing one with the same make, number, and logo.
In this day and age when top golfers have been likened to Formula One race
cars, with different rates for advertisements on chest, arms, head, feet and so
on, is there any golfing space not taken up?
Well, yes there is. In these columns recently, Ian Archer drew attention to a
boxing match where the backs of fighters' shorts were endorsed. We look forward
to the day when a putt is holed on the eighteenth green at St Andrews on the
final day of the Open Championship, and the newly-crowned champion bends over
to pick his ball out of the hole revealing on his backside the name of his
sponsor in its full glory.

NUCLEAR Electric chairman John Collier, regarded as the power behind the
nuclear success story, has died after a short illness, the company announced
yesterday.
The death of Mr Collier on Saturday came as Nuclear Electric prepares to be
privatised next summer. Mr Collier, who was 60, was appointed chairman in 1990.
Nuclear Electric felt an immense sense of loss. John Collier's achievements
would stand as a permanent memorial to a lifetime spent in the nuclear
industry, said chief executive Dr Robert Hawley.
Mr Collier came to lead Nuclear Electric after a career as a research scientist
in the electricity and nuclear industry.
He became head of the Atomic Energy Authority in 1987 and was given the role of
making that more commercial by the Government.
Mr Robin Jeffrey, the chairman and chief executive of Scottish Nuclear was
``deeply upset'' at the news of Mr Collier's death.
``He has known John Collier for many years as a valued friend and respected
colleague and is deeply upset,'' a Scottish Nuclear spokesman said.
Earlier this year, Mr Jeffrey and Mr Collier were both appointed deputy
chairmen of British Energy, the company being set up to lead Nuclear Electric
and Scottish Nuclear into privatisation as a single entity.

IN the end, after a long first half in which dancers danced, singers sang, and
an audience wilted in the stalls, it was more than worth the wait. Principally,
last night was worth while for the traditional finale in which The Joke, the
one that isn't funny, earns its two creators increasingly large gales of
laughter as its telling is hilariously botched by the pair of them. Rikki
Fulton and Jack Milroy: for your undying Franciefulness and ineffable
Josiebundity, we salute you, aye.
In smarter circles, of course, the gradual unveiling of The Joke - you must
know The Joke, the one about the chap that answered the chap that chapped at
the door, and his granny was at his sister's not eating any soup - would be
hailed as a masterclass of comedy deconstruction. But thankfully this isn't
smarter circles: this is a part of Glasgow which will forever be located
somewhere around 1954.
Where Mrs McGlumpher gets black affronted and Mrs Hingmie gets things back to
front. Where language is inventively mangulated, and where blame for the
desiccation of the walls of Jericho is wrongly opportuned upon small boys from
Barmulloch. Where wizened jokes can be embraced like long-lost friends. And
where two wide-os in half-mast trousers fail to recognise the fact that they're
only half as sharp as they'd like to think they are.
Francie are Josie are a slow accretion of daftnesses, and they are a great joy.
You've got two more nights to see them. Don't wait.

THE Government is to take into account the views of consumers and businesses in
drawing up a fundamental reform of competition law, Board of Trade President
Ian Lang announced yesterday.
A comprehensive consultation exercise is to take place in the new year as
Ministers prepare the way for changes to be implemented as soon as practicable.
Mr Lang, opening the fourth day of Commons debate on the proposals contained in
the Queen's Speech, said: ``We intend to prohibit cartels and restrictive trade
agreements unless positive benefits can be shown and we intend to strengthen
the powers of the Director General of Fair Trading to investigate monopolies
and anti-competitive practices.''
Mr Lang's announcement came as he claimed that Britain no longer was the sick
man of Europe but was well on the way to becoming its enterprise centre.
In the face of a sustained Labour attack on the Government's handling of the
economy, he said the first priority for a successful industrial and commercial
policy was to establish the economic conditions within which enterprise could
flourish.
The Queen's Speech had outlined the Government's determination to improve the
the competitveness of the economy.
Attacking Labour's claims that it would reduce taxes, Mr Lang said: ``The
electorate is getting a bit fed up with this absurd pretence by Labour that it
can at one and the same time increase expenditure and cut taxation.''
For Labour, Shadow Trade and Industry Secretary Margaret Beckett claimed that
Britain's growth and investment achievements were below those of major
competitors.
``We have had, under this Government, the lowest average growth in post-war
history, the highest levels of unemployment in post-war history and, for most
people, the biggest tax rises in post-war history. That is this Government's
record.''
Mrs Beckett turned on Mr Lang over remarks last week about job insecurity being
a ``state of mind.'' She said this would touch ``the rawest of nerves'' for
those who had lost their jobs or lived in hourly fear of being made redundant.
q Earlier, Mr Lang set out his response to talks on plans to streamline
industrial tribunal procedures which rename them employment tribunals and aim
to promote voluntary settlement of disputes.
He said in a written reply that the Government is to implement most of the
proposals in a green paper published last year.
Mr Lang added: ``The Government continues to believe that employment disputes
should, where possible, be resolved in-house through employers' own procedures.
``However, it recognises the reservations expressed by many responding to the
green paper that the proposal to require employees to attempt to resolve
disputes with their employers before being able to make an application to an
industrial tribunal might lead to increased delays and complexity in tribunal
procedures, rather than alleviating them. The Government has decided not to
take forward this proposal.
``The Government also recognises the concerns voiced about the proposals to
require chairmen to sit alone, without lay members, in certain cases and has
decided not to introduce any such statutory requirement. However the Government
is minded to extend the existing discretion for chairmen to sit alone where
they consider this appropriate for certain technical cases, such as the
determination of entitlement to redundancy payment.''
The Trade and Industry Department said proposals to be implemented by the
Government included:
q Tribunals to be required to take into account whether applicants had sought
to resolve their dispute with their employer before making a tribunal
application.
q Independent binding arbitration to be made available as a voluntary
alternative to a tribunal hearing.
q Acas conciliation to be made available for redundancy payments cases.
q Tribunals to issue decisions in absence where the respondent employer fails
to file a defence.
Labour Employment spokesman Ian McCartney said: ``There has been at least one
major Government U-turn in dropping proposals to make it even more difficult to
make a legitimate claim to a tribunal. The reversal of proposals to allow
chairmen to sit alone as judge and jury in vital cases is also a humiliating
defeat for Mr Lang.''

FORMER England captain John Emburey yesterday welcomed the chance to pass on
his experience to Northamptonshire following his appointment as the county's
chief coach. Emburey, in Pakistan as manager of England A, has agreed a
four-year deal and takes up his post in January.
The 43-year-old one-time Middlesex off-spinner will team up with Rob Bailey,
who takes over from Allan Lamb as skipper for 1996, and former England
colleague Neil Foster, who is Northants' new development coach.
But it is not clear whether Emburey, widely regarded as Raymond Illingworth's
natural successor in charge of England's Test side, will play for his new
county, who would need to use one of the two ``contested registrations'' they
are permitted in a five-year period.
Speaking after England A's victory in Multan, Emburey said: ``I am very much
looking forward to taking up the appointment. It will be a new role for me and
a new challenge.''
Northants chief executive Steve Coverdale said Emburey was joining the county
primarily in a coaching capacity but added that playing was ``an option under
consideration.''
In Pakistan, England A were last night celebrating victory by an innings and 43
runs against a Pakistan A side boasting four full Test players.
Dean Headley (five for 34) and Richard Stemp (five for 64) cleaned up yesterday
morning as Pakistan A lost their last five wickets for the addition of just 32
runs in just over an hour's play.
Kent paceman Headley overall took six for 63 from 48 overs to earn himself the
man-of-the-match award.
Meanwhile in South Africa, England were frustrated yet again at Centurion Park
yesterday afternoon. The rain-wrecked first Test against South Africa was
finally abandoned as a draw after lunch.
Any chance of an England win had long gone, but the tourists, having declared
at their Friday afternoon total of 381 for nine, had hoped to salvage a little
bowling practice from the event.
England now face a tricky selection problem on Thursday. The match against
Orange Free State is their only outing before next week's second Test and all
the bowlers are badly short of overs. Other scores:
Second Test. Australia 267 (M E Waugh 88; Mushtaq Ahmed 5-115) and 306 (M A
Taylor 123, M J Slater 73; Mushtaq Ahmed 4-83); Pakistan 198 (Ramiz Raja 59; P
R Reiffel 4-38) and 220 (Aamir Sohail 57; G McGrath 5-61). In Hobart. Australia
won by 155 runs.
Women's first Test. England 209-5 dec (J Brittin 84) and 28-2; India 315-6 dec
(A Jain 110, S Dabir 50no). In Calcutta. Match drawn.

IT IS all so heart-warmingly Scottish . . . mother Ena knocking out new recipes
in the cosy family kitchen, father Gordon single-handedly fighting off takeover
bids by the score from overseas soup barons, while the children, fourth
generation of the cock-a-leekie dynasty, polish the three royal warrants and
work on 100 things to do with beetroot.
To get the couthy image across to the public, Baxters of Speyside has hired a
PR company to tell it like it is . . . many of the ingredients for the
company's products drawn from ``the Highland hills and glens'', the 700-strong
workforce recruited from local villages, ``bringing with it a spirit of
friendly efficiency and camaraderie not often found today''.
Gives you a cosy feeling all through . . . tradition . . . family . . . local
enterprise. But in which nearby village has the Baxter family found its public
relation advisers - are Cameron Choat and Partners a well-known Speyside
publicity powerhouse?
According to the PR company's invitation to the Diary to take a trip to
Speyside or to ``meet Michael Baxter'', such delights may be had by phoning
Pippa Brown on an 0171 number or writing to an address at SW7. Whatever
happened to the local Speyside spirit of ``friendly efficiency and camaraderie
not often found today''?
Watch this space
PROPERTY developers in Edinburgh, anxious to ease an embarrassing shortage of
hotel bedrooms in the festival city, are keeping a close eye on a seven-storey
building bang in the centre of town. Focus of their interest is number 20 North
Bridge, with magnificent views along Princes Street - a grand building by
today's standards for the mere taking in of births, marriages, and deaths ads
and the issuing of competition vouchers.
It is owned by the yachting Barclay brothers - David and Frederick - who
recently bought the troika of newspapers published in the east of this country.
The Barclay brothers, who made a pile in property, also own the Ritz Hotel in
London and staff at Number 20 are running a book on ``will they, won't they?''
The brothers, for the time being, are not saying. We will, in the oft-uttered
words of a newspaper publisher who fell off his yacht, just have to ``wait and
see''.
In firing line
IT'S tough on the streets in No Mean City. BBC journalists at Queen Margaret
Drive who leave the building to meet the great listening and viewing public are
being offered a course in, wait for it, wait for it . . . Bullet Penetration.
Scheduled for Bisley on December 6, it is apparently just a case of turn up in
your own armoured car, BYOFJ - bring your own flak jacket - and find out what a
sustained burst of heavy machine-gun fire can do to even the best crafted of
scripts.
Official explanation is that the bullet course - run by former SAS men - is to
get the boys and girls up to speed for duty in the former Yugoslavia. But
airwaves hacks remain concerned as to what really lies behind Auntie's
high-calibre kindness.
Could it be, they ask, that recent studies of audience attitude have revealed
hostility towards repeats so deep that couch potatoes have tooled up? Or has
the Beeb's controller of Diana Tapes heard from a militant pro-Prince Charles
lobby emerging from deep cover? Also, if it really is just about taking Balkan
flak, might not the Corporation in these cost-conscious times find it cheaper
to train ex-SAS men as broadcasters rather than vice-versa? Take care out there.
Illegal fir trade
THERE are now just 29 shopping days to Christmas - a time when the
professionally light-fingered turn their thoughts to the seasonal trade of
trees. Rusty old Transit van not at present busy on a bank raid? Chain saw
ready under the children's bunk beds? The time of goodwill to all men and money
short? Get busy . . . chop, chop.
Last Christmas Scots spent over #1.5m for almost 300,000 dwarf conifer to stick
beside the TV . . . decorated totems that, before Hogmanay, deposited their
needles on the nation's wall-to-wall Wilton.
According to the Forestry Commission, a major player in the needle business,
theft is no more than a small ``regional problem'' . . . which the Diary takes
to mean that it is not organised by a Napoleon of Crime with a white cat on his
lap. But Christmas trees do disappear.
To keep you on the right side of the law, and your carpet needle-free as long
as possible, the Diary presents the Bluffer's Guide to Christmas Trees. The
commission's Arwin Salwan says: ``The Norway spruce, which is what everyone
thinks of as a Christmas tree, is only cut once the sales season is under way
because it sheds its needles quite quickly.''
The Noble Fir - by name and nature - is, however, proof against needle drop for
up to three months. So now you know. If you are offered a Norway spruce at a
keen price weeks and weeks before Santa sets off . . . think twice. If it is a
Noble Fir . . . nae bother.
Beatles cover
WITH the return of Beatlemania the Diary goes back in time to memories of a
press conference given by the Fab Four when they were mere lads. All Scotland
was there but alas the collected wit and wisdom of the Mersey suits went
largely unremarked owing to the absence of an interpreter.
But one thing was revealed by a Scots roadie ruthlessly pumped for
indiscretions by the Diary. Wherever the boys performed, he said, seats in the
first five rows of the theatre were first covered with elasticated plastic
protectors. For decades the Diary has wondered why. Now could be the time to
find out. Answers on a postcard please.
The Mound (II)
JOLLY Jaqui Low, the Scottish Tory spin doctor who last week assured the Diary
``my bum is still on my seat'' following the defection of the Conservative
Party's London press guru, is this week . . . moving her seat.
The large leather chair which is Jaqui's power base at the Leith docklands
branch of government will be carried across the road into the stark jam factory
that is the new Scottish Office.
There she will be at the elbow of the semi-devolved Michael Forsyth to keep him
politically correct as the yet unannounced election campaign revs up from
gloves off to boots on. But it may prove difficult for Jaqui to keep her mind
focused given her new surroundings.
Quite apart from the delight of the in-house swimming pool and the soporific
rustle of paper removed remorselessly from in-tray to out there is also the
puzzle of some hundred tonnes of earth tipped in the centre of an internal
courtyard . . . a grass-covered burial mound large enough to accommodate the
entire Shadow Cabinet.
Why is it there? What does it mean? The Diary, despite investigation, cannot
say. According to a Scottish Office spokeswoman the mound is shaped the way it
is for the purpose of drainage. But why is the earth there at all to need to be
drained - for the purpose of decoration perhaps? No, it is landscaped for the
purpose of drainage'', was the reply. Jaqui Low, spin doctor with bum on seat,
may yet find the Civil Service mind-set something of a challenge.

<HEADLINE>Forsyth accused on drugs initiative</HEADLINE>

<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>12</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975274147</RECORDNO>

LABOUR has accused Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth of playing politics with
young lives by refusing to back an all-party drugs initiative to keep track of
the problem.
Scottish Labour Home Affairs spokesman Mr John McFall said that he had proposed
a new standing committee of Scottish MPs to monitor drugs misuse, and although
the Scottish Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party had pledged
support for the idea it had been turned down by Mr Forsyth.
St Andrew's House sources confirmed that Mr Forsyth had not liked the idea. An
aide said: ``The Secretary of State has said publicly that the drugs problem is
the number one issue on his desk, but what Mr Forsyth wants now is action, not
another committee sitting around talking.''
However, Mr McFall said that other initiatives such as the Select Committee on
drug misuse and the Minister's Task Force on drugs only provided a snapshot of
a single period in time.
He believed that a standing committee reporting back regularly to the Scottish
Grand Committee would provide a way of continuously monitoring a scene which
changed from month to month.
``Mr Forsyth has said he sees this as a vital issue. If so, he should join us
in setting up this standing committee,'' said Mr McFall, who was speaking at a
Labour Party news conference calling for nationally co-ordinated action on
knife crime and drugs.
An effort had to be made to eliminate the ``culture of the knife'' which had
resulted in 437 deaths over the last 10 years, the majority among young men, he
said. Fatal stabbings increased again last year after a dip in 1993. ``Each one
of these statistics represents a tragedy, not only for the victims but for the
families involved,'' Mr McFall said.
Praising exercises such as Operation Blade in Strathclyde and, more recently,
Operation Combat in Tayside, he said there was a need for similar exercises to
be carried out more regularly across the country.
The Tayside action on knife crime had uncovered 182 weapons and the number of
incidents had fallen by 29% as a result. Operation Combat had successfully
combined such enforcement with educational work and an amnesty for handing in
weapons.
He added that this kind of multi-strand approach could be used successfully to
combat drugs problems, but where such work was proved to work the Government
must step in with additional funds to extend such initiatives.

SUDDENLY they're not half the tunesmiths they used to be: the Beatles'
much-publicised new single was aired yesterday, and it's not very good. Not
very good at all. Is it the worst song they've ever committed to disc? No. My
Bonny Lies Over The Ocean is still easily the worst thing they've ever
inflicted upon the medium of recorded sound.
But Free As A Bird does nothing to advance the reputation of Messrs Lennon and
McCartney as toppermost songwriters in the original golden age of beat.
It's certainly the most disappointing thing they've ever done. It would, of
course, be impossible for it to be anything else in the light of the vast
amounts of media hoop-la which the first truly posthumous Beatles' single has
been accorded over the past six months.
For as every newspaper-reader, TV-watcher, and radio listener in the world
knows, Free As A Bird is based on a rough vocal John Lennon recorded in 1977,
three years before his assassination. It was completed by the three surviving
Beatles earlier this year.
Free As A Bird is intended to advertise sundry forthcoming TV rockumentaries
about the Fab Four's early days. It's also meant to alert the Christmas
gift-buying public to today's release of Anthology, the first instalment of a
major trawl by the Not-So-Fab Three through the Beatles' sound-archives.
Free As A Bird: the single's title did nothing to inspire confidence in the
quality of the music on offer, even before Radio 1 gave it its first public
broadcast in yesterday's wee small hours. Free As a Bird: it's a cliche.
And Beatle songs didn't have cliches in them. Beatles songs don't generally
even have similes in them - and especially not in the title. Because similes
are slow and cumbersome things, and Beatles' songs were always about surprise
and freshness.
To give just one instance from Sgt Pepper, the Beatles famously sang of
newspaper taxis arriving on the shore, waiting to take folk away. They didn't
sing about taxis that look like newspapers.
But what's actually wrong with the way Free As A Bird sounds?
Well, it was probably due to the studio nous of their producer, George Martin,
but the very best Beatles' singles always grabbed your attention by sounding
like nothing else from the very first second. A buzz of distorted bass-guitar.
A sudden nasal chorus.
In contrast, Free As A Bird begins drearily and meanders on drearily. Lacking
confidence in his vocal abilities, Lennon always double-tracked them to beef
them up. Here, though, he sounds as though he's whimpering them into a bucket.
Paul does the same perennially-perky-pleader-Paul-singing-with-his-thumb-aloft
bit you've heard on all his post-Beatles singles. George noodles his way
through an anonymous guitar solo. Ringo phones in his drumming from the pub
where he's gone for a nice non-alcoholic lager instead of anything more rousing.
Tune? A plodding one. Message? Things aren't what they were unfortunately and
Dearie me, doesn't time fly.
Jeff Lynne produced it. Jeff Lynne used to be in the Idle Race, who wanted to
be Birmingham's Beatles, and weren't. The same Jeff Lynne was in the Electric
Light Orchestra, whose every record resembled a poor out-take from Sgt Pepper.
How do I feel? The Beatles once said it: I'm down, I'm really down. Up in the
higher tiers of pop's Valhalla, sardonic Johnny Lennon is looking down his nose
and angrily rattling his bejewelled cuban-heel boots. New Beatles' singles used
to be good. Long ago. Long before yesterday.

STEPHEN Gallacher will this week go into the PGA European Tour qualifying
school finals on the Costa del Sol with the advice of his uncle, Bernard, the
captain of Europe's victorious Ryder Cup team, uppermost in his mind. ``You
don't have to win this competition,'' the elder Gallacher reminded his nephew.
``Just be sure you make it.''
That was the approach which helped the 21-year-old Bathgate golfer to negotiate
successfully the first hurdle to a professional career, one of last month's
four pre-qualifying events, in which Gallacher finished comfortably in joint
seventh place. The sterner test, which begins its protracted odyssey on
Thursday, now follows.
At least Gallacher will approach it in a positive frame of mind now that he has
been given a clean bill of health from what was suspected to be glandular
fever. Blood tests last week dispelled all fears of that threat to his
ambitions, although he remains on a course of antibiotics.
``The pre-qualifying was my last competitive outing,'' Gallacher said before he
left at the weekend for the six-round examination, which this year has moved
from the unreliable climate of Massane, in France, to the courses at San Roque
and Guadalmina in southern Spain, where the weather and the playing conditions
will surely be more congenial.
The process is, as ever, a daunting one. As many as 183 players will take part,
of whom only the first 40 and those tieing for fortieth place will gain access
to the 1996 tour. For those who make the four-round cut but who finish outside
the magic circle there is the consolation of having qualified for the
experience to be had on the subsidiary Challenge Tour.
Upon this delicate balance depends the immediate future of Gallacher, who has
achieved so much as an amateur in the past four years, principally as winner of
the Scottish matchplay and strokeplay titles and several other events of
importance. He also made his contribution to that rare occurrence, a Great
Britain and Ireland victory over the United States in the Walker Cup match.
However the issue is resolved for him over these next, career-forming days,
Gallacher can anyway look forward to the fund-raising dinner being organised by
his club which will be held early next month to help him launch his
professional tournament life.
He hopes that between individual contributions and group sponsorships an
initial nest-egg of up to #6000 will be achieved.
Gallacher is one of seven Scots taking part. The others are Andrew Crerar,
William Guy, Scott Henderson, Brian Marchbank, Raymond Russell, and David
Scott. Henderson and Russell, as it happens, both finished in first place in
their preliminary competitions in Spain.
The rewards of the professional game have become so lucrative for those who
make even a modest success, as the performances of some of the outstanding
recent recruits have shown - most notably the Czech-born German, Alexander
Cejka, a graduate of the 1993 school (his sixth), who was 102nd on the 1994
order of merit, and, after three victories this year, sixth on the list with
more than #308,000.
From last year's school Scotland's Dean Robertson, the two Scandinavians,
Michael Jonzon and Oyvind Rojahn, and Christian Cevaer of France set about
establishing their careers by finishing second or joint second in tournaments
during the season just completed.
With that level of progress as example and incentive, little wonder amateurs of
proven worth view their own prospects so confidently.

SHARES in Graseby, the advanced technology medical and products monitoring
group, slid 18p to 125p yesterday after a profits warning indicating the
full-year total could slump from #10.1m to about #6.3m.
However, the setback will undoubtedly put Graseby much higher up the lists of
possible takeover targets. It is arguably too small to be an effective global
player but is blessed with technology that would be more actively exploited by
a larger company with greater marketing firepower.
The problems were on two fronts. One was product monitoring, where in the first
nine months there was a substantial reduction in sales of metal detectors to
the US food industry as a result of takeovers in the sector. Happily, there is
now a distinct improvement in the order level. The other difficulty was with
check-weighers where there were delays with the software costing #400,000 to
put right.
In addition, there were downturns in demand for emission detection equipment in
the US because of hold-ups in passing the appropriate legislation regarding the
utility companies.
Chairman John Jackson, who includes Ladbroke in his quiver, hopes there will be
some recovery next year ahead of the US presidential election, when green
issues will come to the fore and individual state governors will play the
environmental card.
A sweeping management reorganisation and a redundancy programme have cost #2m
but have also removed #1.2m of annual costs.
Fortunately, the medical division has raised turnover by 15% in the first nine
months helped by an increase in demand for its portable continuous drug
administration pumps, while Graseby will also benefit from a #1.6m order from
Zeneca for delivery of a pump system to Japan next year.
The dividend total will be held unchanged at 6.6p with a 3.9p final for an
attractive and underpinning 6.6% yield.

WHATEVER happened to Iain Heggie? Five years ago it seemed certain that the
Glasgow playwright could only consolidate his position as the most distinctive
theatrical voice of his generation. Having burst on to the scene with the Mobil
Special Prize-winning A Wholly Healthy Glasgow, first produced in Manchester in
1987 and directed by Richard Wilson, Heggie displayed a singular linguistic
energy and narrative drive.
A Wholly Healthy Glasgow, scandalously still to be produced in the playwright's
home city, was followed by American Bagpipes (also produced in Manchester) and
Clyde Nouveau (produced by Glasgow's Tron Theatre in the 1989 Edinburgh
Festival), plus assorted short comedies - Waiting for Shuggie's Ma, Politics in
the Park - and in 1991 A Night of Gentle Sex Comedies, a package of playlets
directed in its first production by a pre-7:84 Iain Reekie.
By the start of the decade Heggie seemed under commission from every theatre in
the country. Yet somehow the commissions never grew into fully-fledged plays.
Apart from the libretto for Tourist Variations in the Traverse Theatre's new
opera double-bill for the 1993 Edinburgh Festival (score by James MacMillan),
nothing substantial was forthcoming.
So why the drought? Much of it had to do with Heggie's disillusionment with a
British theatre system which routinely relies on pitifully low rates of pay
coupled with inadequate amounts of time in which to write. Even after Clyde
Nouveau had been produced with a reasonable degree of success, the meticulous
Heggie would still have liked to have put in another six month's work on it.
In 1990 he was talking of abandoning theatre for the better-paid world of
television. What he did instead was lie low, bolster his income with teaching
(he was a PE instructor and drama teacher before turning to writing full-time),
and let the writing progress at its own rate.
He's spent the best part of three years trying to find the forces that have
transformed An Experienced Woman Gives Advice from the miniature ``sex comedy''
he initially envisioned into the full-length show to open on Thursday at
Manchester's Royal Exchange.
That Manchester and not Glasgow should be treated to the first Heggie play in
ages is as irritating to Heggie as anyone else. With a plum Scottish cast -
Siobhan Redmond, David Tennant, Alastair Galbraith, Alexander Morton, Jenny
McCrindle - An Experienced Woman Gives Advice looks like a thoroughly Scottish
affair.
``It's because the Royal Exchange likes my work. My work is very actor-centred,
and that's the theatre's taste. In Glasgow and Edinburgh, probably the most
suitable places for the work to go on in Scotland, there are a lot of directors
just now who are visual-concept directors. We're not necessarily very good
bedfellows.''
Heggie says this without bitterness, but it's an understandable frustration
that plays with a broadly Glaswegian setting are being missed by the home
audience. He's not as concerned with the specific location of his plays as many
Scottish writers, but he recognises that place does mean things to people.
An Experienced Woman Gives Advice is set in the back green of a
none-too-specific Glasgow tenement where a thirtysomething woman is trying to
get on with the gardening only to be interrupted by people seeking her help.
``During the course of the action, the people wanting advice gradually reveal
stories that have a big effect on her,'' says Heggie. ``Sex comedy is one
description of it, but it's also probably sadder than anything else I've
written.''

son, Holly Lionel - out of Holly Verona - for 1800gns.
W&amp;T Nelson of Ballantrae, paid 1700gns for Holly Littlejohn, an April-born son
of Hartside Glen, and WJ Douglas &amp; Son of Jedburgh went to 1600gns for the
seven-month-old Cloughhead Charlie son, Holly Laughingboy, out of Holly Edith.
The Aldwyck Limousin herd of Wrington, Bristol, also offered for sale their
1995 bull calf crop as did the Beck herd from Colne, Lancashire.
Averages: Holly Limousins - 13 heifer calves #977 (down #14.94), 27 bull calves

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth last night urged business leaders to ``wake
up'' to the perils of Labour's promised home-rule parliament.
His call came in a meeting of financiers in Edinburgh ahead of the publication
today of a survey of business attitudes to Scottish devolution.
``We simply must not sleepwalk into constitutional change for which we could
pay very dearly,'' Mr Forsyth told the annual dinner of Scottish Financial
Enterprise.
He claimed that apart from the extra income tax implications, Labour's Scottish
parliament plan also could mean less public spending cash for Scotland from the
Westminister Government.
Scotland currently enjoyed #600 more per head than England, he said.

MORCELI, a faller at Ascot last Saturday, was yesterday being lined up for a
quick retrieval mission over hurdles.
Connections are set to switch the grey from fences to tackle the #30,000-added
Bellway Homes `Fighting Fifth' Hurdle at Newcastle next weekend.
Morceli is in great shape despite his crashing fall in the First Bank Gold Cup
at Ascot.
``He's very fresh and is bucking and kicking. He's been ridden out today and he
will almost certainly run on Saturday,'' said trainer Howard Johnson's wife Sue.
``It's a shame about his fall as we still don't know how good he is. It's the
first time he's fallen and Warren Marson felt the sun might have been a bit of
a problem.''

Continental Europe.
Industrial Estates (Scotland) Ltd (IES) is looking to buy former defence
properties in eastern Germany, where about 320 are available in Brandenburg
alone, as well as continuing to increase its stake of locations in Scotland and
England.
IES, which has its headquarters at the Cupar Trading Estate, is the only
company in Scotland that revitalises often run-down industrial centres,
managing director John Gavin said yesterday.
``It is an expanding business,'' he said, ``with seven sites in Scotland and a
further two in England.''
The most recent acquisition was the former German-owned UMM factory in County
Durham. Previous success stories have included the former Markham Colliery in
Chesterfield, now the M1 Commerce Park.

<HEADLINE>Howard denies plans are `racist' . Move against immigration `racketeers'</HEADLINE>

<PAGE>12</PAGE>

HOME Secretary Michael Howard yesterday unveiled a package of tough measures,
including prison terms for immigration ``racketeers'', designed to crack down
on what he described as ``bogus-asylum seekers.'' Labour said it was a crude
political attempt to win the racist vote.
The Immigration and Asylum Bill is expected to be one of the most contentious
of the new parliamentary session. It would create a so-called white list of
countries whose citizens would face greater difficulties in gaining asylum.
The Bill also would cut down on the #200m in benefits paid out annually to
Britain's population of 75,000 asylum-seekers, and it would introduce penalties
for businesses that knowingly hire illegal immigrants.
It would grant immigration officials the right to deport within 24 hours
asylum-seekers who arrive from neighbouring third countries. If they wanted to
appeal against expulsion, under international law they would have to do from
the first country they arrived in on fleeing their own.
Reflecting the controversy caused by his plan, Mr Howard interrupted the
traditional five-day debate of the Queen's Speech to make a statement
explaining his proposals in advance of the Bill being published.
He said the Government wanted to be ``fair but firm'' and assured MPs it was
not an attempt to ``play the race card'' in advance of a General Election:
``There is no question whatever of racism in these proposals.''
The number of applicants had increased dramatically, he said. Britain had
become ``far too attractive a destination for bogus asylum seekers and other
illegal immigrants.''
In reply, Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw repeated Labour's demand - rejected
by the Prime Minister - that the Bill be handled by a special standing
committee to take the issue out of politics and ensure that the new measures do
not unfairly discriminate against asylum-seekers.
Mr Straw said Labour accepted the asylum procedure must be speeded up and
``fraudulent asylum seekers must be weeded out''. He said: ``It must work in a
way that is fair and just to any genuine applicant.''
Mr Howard said: ``By claiming asylum, those who have no basis to remain here
can not only substantially prolong their stay but also gain access to benefit
and housing at public expense.''
The ``white list'' of countries deemed to be politically stable and unlikely
therefore to produce legitimate asylum-seekers will be published during the
early stages of the Bill's passage through Parliament. Mr Howard said that
contrary to his critics' claims, ``Nigeria is not and never has been amongst
them.''
Mr Howard said the list would not mean automatic disqualification. ``If
individual applicants from countries on the designated list, all of whom will
have their applications individually considered, do indeed establish a
well-founded fear of persecution, their application for asylum will be
granted.''
The Bill also will:
q Make appeals against return to a safe third country exercisable only after
the applicant's removal.
q Remove ``obstacles to the effective operation'' of the existing laws,
including the extension of an accelerated appeal procedure to a wider range of
cases.
q Make it a criminal offence to employ a person not entitled to work in the UK.
Mr Howard pledged that the new restrictions on employing illegal immigrants
would not impose significant new burdens on employers, or lead to racial
discrimination.
Liberal Democrat MP Sir David Steel asked him to repudiate the words of Andrew
Lansley, a Tory parliamentary candidate, who had written an article in the
Observer suggesting that the immigration issue at the last election ``played
particularly well in the tabloids and has more potential to hurt''.
Several Tory back benchers expressed disquiet that the measures might be too
draconian. Mr Howard assured them that he had no intention of damaging
Britain's long-standing ``tradition of offering sanctuary to genuine refugees''
but he insisted: ``we should be a haven, not a honeypot.''

AN ORGANISER of Scotland's biggest march and rally against racism yesterday
accused Home Secretary Michael Howard of playing a ``squalid race card'' with
the proposed measures to curb immigration and asylum.
Mr Bill Speirs, deputy general secretary of the Scottish TUC, said the
legislation only would encourage the already rising tide of racism in Britain.
He claimed that the Immigration and Asylum Bill would send out the wrong
message to people on the fringes of politics and society, and encourage them to
discriminate against people whose skins or backgrounds were different to their
own.
The STUC is one of a number of bodies supporting the march and rally against
racism and fascism which is marching from Blythswood Square at 11am on Saturday.
Speakers from the Labour Party, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats will be
giving their backing at a rally which is to follow at the City Hall in Glasgow.
Mr Speirs said: ``Clearly we want to work as hard as we can to clear Scotland
of racism, and to scotch the myth that there is no racism in Scotland. It's
important that people realise its existence and how damaging it is to our
society.''
He added: ``As for the Government's proposed legislation, it has nothing
whatsover to do with tackling any real problem, but more to do with playing a
squalid race card in the run-up to the election.''
Ms Najimee Parveen, a policy officer with the Commission for Racial Equality,
said that racial incidents reported to the police in Scotland, including
assaults and damage to property, had doubled in the last five years
Backing for Saturday's rally also has come from the National Union of Students
which has set up a 24-hour telephone line to monitor what it calls the worrying
rise in racist incidents on college and university campuses.
The NUS says it is seriously concerned for the safety of students, and claims
that racist groups are specifically targetting students on campuses.

<HEADLINE>Major and Bruton to talk, but problems remain</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975274160</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Prime Minister and Irish Premier John Bruton could meet for a new bid to
break the peace process deadlock before the end of the week, it emerged last
night.
Senior Whitehall sources said the Government was pencilling in Friday as a
possible date for a summit - and laying down no conditions over a venue.
The surprise news came as London awaited a formal response from Dublin on a
series of proposals put forward by Mr Major over the weekend.
Mr Bruton, who is anxious to see early movement to all-party talks on Northern
Ireland, is thought likely to respond positively to the suggestion of an early
meeting.
It is thought Mr Major and Mr Bruton may be in touch by phone today.
However, sources in Dublin were playing down expectations of a breakthrough in
the impasse which has dogged negotations for weeks.
A Government source in London said: ``We are ready to roll as soon as Mr Bruton
can respond positively to our proposals.
``The first real opportunity for the Prime Minister to be able to do this is
Friday. We are targeting the end of the week if at all possible and the Irish
know this.
``It is hard to read at the moment, but if we are getting any signals out of
Dublin, it is that that they too would like to do the same.''
The last summit, set for Chequers in early September, was postponed at the last
minute by Dublin after Sinn Fein raised objections to plans being drawn up by
the two governments.
Mr Bruton yesterday consulted senior Cabinet colleagues and officials about the
Downing Street suggestions.
Significantly, he also called in Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and SDLP leader
John Hume for private discussions. Neither was thought to have been told the
full details of Mr Major's blueprint.
However sources close to the Taoiseach warned that the Major proposals were
unlikely to prompt a peace process breakthrough - a signal that potentially
serious differences had still to be overcome between the two leaders.
The difficulties centre on continuing British insistence that the IRA must move
to decommission arms ahead of the entry of Sinn Fein into all-party talks.
Downing Street made it clear that London was seeking a courageous approach by
Mr Bruton towards advancing the peace process. Officials said ``the ball is now
in Dublin's court'' and looked forward to the early re-activation of the summit
timetable.

HE IS to sail the Atlantic this winter, he has become expert in water-skiing,
power-boating, and rock-climbing, and it's all in the line of work for Mike
Agnew. He's not bad with guns and grenades, either; he knows a thing or two
about tanks and mines; and he's had spells in Northern Ireland and Bosnia.
Life is far from dull for Mike Agnew. That's because he is Captain Mike Agnew
of the Royal Highland Fusiliers - a man with a job that's not exactly
nine-to-five but which he finds thoroughly enjoyable.
Captain Agnew spends his time these days as Army Schools Liaison Officer for
South-West Scotland. That means he travels round 100 schools, giving
presentations about the Army and setting up mini-assault courses to show the
kids something about team-working.
For that is something on which he has come to place a great deal of reliance.
It is what makes the Army work.
He learned that in Bosnia, from which country he returned in May this year
after six months as a liaison officer in Gornji Vakuf, helping aid agencies
with their work, arranging structural repairs, and meeting with officials from
the Bosnian and Croatian authorities to discuss the implementation of the
ceasefire.
``Bosnia is a beautiful place with warm, friendly people,'' he says. ``The only
thing is they don't seem to be able to get on with their neighbours.'' He sees
this as tragic and makes comparisons with Northern Ireland, where he also
served with the RHF.
Born in Gatehouse-of-Fleet and educated at Clifton College in Bristol, he had a
couple of jobs in London before taking a B.Sc. in civil engineering at Heriot
Watt University, Edinburgh, then spending 18 months travelling the world and
doing a lot of sailing, skiing, and windsurfing.
As a boy he had enjoyed his experiences with the Combined Cadet Force at
Clifton, so he applied for the Army, went through the interviews and selection
procedures, passed his exams, and spent a further six months travelling the
world - visiting India, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand - while
waiting to get into Sandhurst.
He emerged from that famous military establishment as a second lieutenant after
a passing-out parade in front of the Queen in April, 1991. He has since gone on
to be promoted to first lieutenant and then captain (in October, 1993), to take
a series of courses, and to run the Glasgow Army Youth Team, which meant taking
youngsters from deprived areas to the Army camp at Garelochead and teaching
them canoeing, abseiling, hillwalking, and other outdoor pursuits.
He has also spent six months in Belize learning jungle warfare techniques, and
was in Germany on a staff assignment for a time.
In December he is to be first mate on a 55ft Nicholson yacht on a voyage from
Africa to Brazil - an adventure training exercise which should last about three
weeks and will test the ability of all 12 men on board to work as a team.
As Captain Agnew says, that's what makes the Army work. And as he has his
Christmas dinner in Brazil, he can reflect once more that he is certainly in no
ordinary job.

THE yellowing obituaries lie in newspaper ``morgue'' files; the BBC and ITN
have had filmic tributes in store these 30 years; public buildings, throughout
these isles, have orders filed for mournful lowering of the Union flag. And yet
she lives, our everlasting Queen Mother. What immortal strength! If Di's on
Prozac, she's on Duracell.
Each day the bulletins come, warm with hope and limp on detail. The Queen
Mother had a restful night. The Queen Mother took two or three steps today. The
Prince of Wales has visited the Queen Mother. Her Majesty today got pleasantly
sloshed on pink gin. Well, actually, I made that one up; but it's a wonderful
image.
In extremis, nothing rallies our royal house as much as a really good illness.
Republicanism, in the early 1870s, was a serious political threat - much more
real than today, with respected statesmen like Joseph Chamberlain espousing it.
Then the Price of Wales, widely loathed and despised - he was already grossly
fat, a notorious philanderer, an occasional co-respondent in the divorce courts
- fell prey to typhoid. For a day or two his life was despaired of. And the
country, all of a sudden, convulsed in grief. They hung on every word issued by
the royal physicians, whizzing through the telegraph . . .
Across the wires the electric message came:
``He is no better, he is much the        same.''
. . . as Alfred Austin recalled in dreadful verse. But the Prince recovered.
The nation rejoiced, and republican sentiments were unfashionable thereafter.
Thus with the Queen Mother's hip. All of a sudden we abandon our jokes about
everlasting old bats and feathery tulle. We realise how much we might miss her.
We realise just how long she has been around.
Here is a woman who nursed in the Great War; whose wedding, more than 70 years
ago, was attended by Queen Alexandra (and was the first royal occasion to be
broadcast); who has met, and known, just about anybody who was anybody in the
twentieth century. With Londoners she braved the Blitz. Widowed, more than 40
years ago, she did not fade into obscurity, but renewed herself as the nation's
grandmother.
She has a daughter pushing 70 and a grandson nearer 50 than 40; her great
grandson plays rugby for Scotland. And she bears her years well, the old bird.
Few TV spectacles were as moving, in recent years, as the 75th anniversary of
the Armistice in 1993. Dozens of old survivors from the trenches hirpled into
Westminster Abbey, and she, small and ancient (who lost a beloved brother in
that war) pegged a poppy and wept with them. Only in May she starred in the
V-day commemorations. A fortnight ago, in visible agony, she planted another
Armistice poppy.
There's a dark side to the Queen Mother too; that's why I like her. She is
ill-served by her prevalent image of a simpering, lacy, lovable old granny. She
is for truth, of formidable intellect and steely will. There is ruthlessness
there. Without hesitation, to safeguard her husband's fragile monarchy, she
destroyed any possible British place for the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.
Mindful of her elder daughter's interests, she, more than anyone, prevented
Prin-1cess Margaret's marriage to the tragic Townsend. When her nephew, newly
Earl of Strathmore, married an Irish nurse of low birth, she cut him and her
dead. (But, when that tragic woman died, insane of grief, after losing her only
child, the good Queen Mother sent a wreath.)
Stuff the fluffy; give me pride and malice any day, if only for human interest.
Her sheer survival, and prominence, through so many decades of national
experience, has won the Queen Mother the adoration of millions and the grudging
regard of the rest of us. It was very early in that fame, however, that she
learned a lesson that has served her well. On the evening her engagement to the
Duke of York was announced, in 1923, Miss Bowes-Lyon - as she then was -
received the press on the doorstep of her London home. She chatted amiably to
them. Yes, she was happy. Oh yes, her family were beside themselves with joy.
On the morrow the palace sent the heavies round. Royal ladies, she was firmly
advised, did not talk to reporters. They did not discuss family matters. In
fact, they never spoke to anyone, outside ``the Firm'', about anything very
much at all.
Is not much of the Queen Mother's enduring esteem down to this? Not for nothing
is she known, popularly, as the Queen Mum. Her views on architecture are veiled
from us. We have been spared details of her mental health, or past marital
conflicts. She never swears, never says rude things about the IRA at parties,
has never been seen to kick a horse. Apart from trilled banalities about the
weather and the crowds, or making one of her very rare speeches, the Queen
Mother does little more than glow.
Sour voices, inevitably, have been raised about her nice new hip. The
operation, we are told, is seldom granted to really old grannies on the NHS,
and the Queen Mother is one of the oldest people in the world to have received
it. But it is hard to believe that someone of equivalent age and vigour - after
all, there are precious few 95-year-olds still walking about and addressing
large public meetings - would be denied this treatment.
And a dear friend of mine had a similar operation when she was 101, when she
had broken her hip; it granted her two more serene and happy years, rather than
a few pain-wracked last weeks.
If the Queen Mother's treatment succeeds - and there is every reason to hope
that it will - then it will demonstrate one of the advantages of monarchy; its
ability to highlight matters and devices of general usefulness. The
hip-replacement operation is further publicised; its benefits, even to the
ancient, advertised. Other aged biddies, hitherto nervous and ill-informed, can
only gain. She is certainly a more credible advertisement for the treatment
than her grandson's wife is for Relate.
If we have to have royals, every blessing to her. May she recover, thrive and
glow on to her century. And may we all learn to give her the place she is due,
as a woman of character and purpose, and not some icky mohaired icon.
It was no soft and scented thing that inspired Wallis Windsor, in bitter
defeat, to write a friend in appreciation of a cosmetic gift. The ``fat Scotch
cook'' had bested her in the end. ``Thanks so much for the `Duchess of York'
powder. And you know where I'll put it.''

<HEADLINE>New building society mortgage lending falls to 16-year low</HEADLINE>

NEW net mortgage lending by the building societies last month fell to its
lowest monthly level since since December 1979, bringing fresh calls from the
housing industry and politicians for the Chancellor to take action in the
Budget. Figures from the Building Societies' Association show that new mortgage
lending in October more than halved to #295m from September's #614m. The BSA
has reiterated its plea for help to the Chancellor.
But while the figures will add to the pressures for a boost to the housing
market on November 28, there has been no indication that the Chancellor is
prepared to make any meaningful concessions on this score, though some
tampering with stamp duty is thought to be a possibility.
Gross mortgage lending, which includes repayments of principal, slipped from
#2725m to #2624m over the month but net new commitments by the societies rose
from #2565m to #2887m. On the savings side there was an inflow of #702m, down
from #903m in the preceding month.
Total lending activity measured by gross advances or net new commitments has,
in fact, held fairly steady in recent months compared with previous years'
levels, especially given that since August Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester has no
longer been included. The contrast with net mortgage lending is striking but a
significant proportion of overall lending business is believed to have
represented remortgage activity rather than lending related to house purchase.
Peter Williams, head of research and external affairs at the BSA, commented:
``Reflecting the very low levels of property transactions generally the number
of loans advanced by building societies for actual house purchase has fallen by
17% in the first 10 months of this year compared with 1994.''
He said that against the backdrop of the slowdown in the wider economy, it was
clear households remained wary of committing themselves to large expenditure.
And he suggested that, while the general cuts in personal taxation likely to be
announced in this month's Budget may help build consumer confidence over time,
``There is also a strong case for the Chancellor to announce specific
additional and immediate measures to help the housing market.''
So far as the savings picture is concerned, Mr Williams said: ``Building
societies have continued to attract healthy positive retail inflows in October.
Taking into account interest which is credited to accounts, building societies'
savings are expected to increase by about #16bn for 1995 as a whole, more than
ample to fund the likely level of net mortgage lending during the year.''

THE Paragon Ensemble's racy programme titles often bear little relation to the
work included in them, but Gordon McPherson's Handguns brought a deliberately
literal dimension to the theme of Musicians Behaving Badly. The final movement
of this new commission obliged the players to deal with a series of
deliberately planted musical misfires and false trails, reflecting the
propensity of early guns to blow up in their users' faces.
Musical compositions can also do that, but any final judgment on this work must
await its completion. It is now envisaged as a six or seven-movement suite, but
only two of them were ready in time for inclusion here. Just to confuse matters
further, they began with (and later repeated) the second movement, as a
slightly whimsical tribute to the Walther pistol and the composer's love of
film music, and the scores of John Barry, in particular, albeit recast in
McPherson's own idiom rather than simply employed as pastiche.
The first movement, inspired by an early gunsmith in Dundee, was a more complex
and rhythmically varied piece, in which the ensemble sounded distinctly
tentative.
The concert opened with McPherson's taut string quartet, Civil Disobedience on
the Northern Front. Its bustling, hard-edged rhythmic momentum and powerful
sense of purpose swept the work along with a finely controlled energy.
Judith Weir's Musicians Wrestle Everywhere, described as a concerto for 10
instruments, provided a nicely contrasted balance to the McPherson pieces. Its
engaging melodies, subtle use of instrumental texture and colour, constantly
shifting moods and characteristic economy were in a lighter vein than we are
used to from this composer, and although it was not played with quite the same
conviction, its quirky charm emerged intact.

Moynihan joins Ranger Oil
FORMER Sport and Energy Minister Colin Moynihan has been appointed a director
of Ranger Oil. He has taken up a position on Ranger's safety, health, and
environmental committee.
Mr Moynihan, above, was an MP for 10 years until he lost his Lewisham East seat
in the 1992 General Election. Between 1990 and 1992 he served as Energy
Minister in Margaret Thatcher's and John Major's governments.

AN 18-MINUTE delay in police responding to a call about a paint attack on Tory
Party chairman Dr Brian Mawhinney was due to human error, Metropolitan Police
Commissioner Sir Paul Condon told MPs yesterday.
Sir Paul said the police officer in charge of arrangements had apologised by
letter to Dr Mawhinney, and his aide, Tory MP Alan Duncan.
Mr Duncan tried frantically to summon police using his mobile telephone when Dr
Mawhinney and his wife were spattered with bright orange paint near Parliament
after the Queen's Speech last Wednesday.
``This was an incident where human error let us down,'' Sir Paul told the
Commons Public Accounts Committee, questioning him on a National Audit Office
report about how the Met responds to calls from the public.
Sir Paul told the MPs: ``The officers involved are very distressed.''
THE Government yesterday defended its decision to pay a private company #1.95m
to take over the National Engineering Laboratory at East Kilbride. Deputy Chief
Whip Lord Chesham told the Lords at Question Time that the bid from Assessment
Services Ltd was ``the best value-for-money option''.
MOVES by the boxing authorities to make fights safer were praised in the
Commons yesterday by Sports Minister Iain Sproat. He said: ``In the last few
weeks alone, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC) has announced measures,
like the new dehydration laws, the new annual scan, the fact that doctors will
be allowed easier access to the ring. But in addition to that, British boxing
is more stringently controlled than boxing anywhere else in the world.''

POLAND'S presidential election was widely expected to lead to a tense
second-round race between Solidarity incumbent Lech Walesa and post-communist
challenger Aleksander Kwasniewski, but few people thought it would be quite so
close and the polarisation of society quite so sharp.
As cold election Sunday wore on, afternoon exit polls gave the first hint of
trouble. Walesa had 51.1% of the vote, his opponent 48.9%, far too close a
margin for comfort, especially since Walesa votes had a tendency to pile up in
the early part of the day - after mass. By the evening these fears were
becoming stronger: Walesa's share had drifted down to 50.2%, Kwasniewski's
rising to 49.8%. Then, at 10pm, the first official election commission estimate
put Kwasniewski in the lead with 51.4%, Walesa's share slipping to 48.6%. The
margin was narrow but began to suggest that Walesa's jacket was hanging on a
particularly shoogly nail.
Before this the clever money was backing a narrow Walesa victory. The
President, after all, seemed to have all the aces: he set the election agenda,
giving it a flavour that was distinctly ``high ideology'', creating a
deliberate clash of values between Solidarity and the ``Bolshevik sincerity of
Aleksander Kwasniewski''; he was the famous founder of the Solidarity ``trade
union'', that quintessentially amorphous movement, united only by Sunday mass
and opposition to a system that was falling apart; and he was Lech Walesa, the
plucky electrician turned head of state, Nobel peace prize winner, and giant on
the Polish political stage.
What went wrong?
For once it seems that Walesa's famed political antennae failed him. His
decision to play ``the red card'', whipping up fears of a return to a species
of communism, to shortages and rationing (of goods and liberties) and to closer
links with Moscow, was evidently flawed. Not enough voters bought the argument
that these were real demons. The menace of communism was fading; in its place,
a growing irritation directed against an over-bearing Church and the Black
Madonna-badged President.
Aleksander Kwasniewski, the argument continued, might try to look like a Polish
JFK, running an energetic election campaign, appealing in particular to Polish
youth, suave and polished in interview and debate but he was dangerously
beholden to less enlightened groups, elements whose attachments remained rooted
in Poland's communist past. But once again not enough voters were convinced.
This was an unusual election. It had no conventional differences of policy or
programme. Vision did figure but it was a contest between competing visions of
the past.
There was only one item of business on Walesa's dangerously limited election
agenda - the account for the mistakes of the past has most definitely not yet
been settled and Kwasniewski helped run up the bill.
But Walesa also carried some awkward baggage on the election trail. Many Poles
had come to distrust him; they disliked his volatility, his inclination to pick
fights with friends as well as foes, his mysterious Rasputin-like advisers, and
his opaque language.
Adam Michnik, an old Solidarity hand and editor of the Gazeta Wyborcza
newspaper, put it bluntly in the closing days of the campaign, even as he urged
readers to rally round the President. Lech, he admitted, was ``unpredictable,
irresponsible, and incompetent'', but at least he had held broadly to the track
mapped out by Solidarity in 1990. It was less than a sweeping endorsement.
What does a Kwasniewski victory mean for Poland?
A society as polarised as Poland seems can be a dangerous place. Those groups -
Silesian steel workers and coal miners, workers in the remaining state-owned
dinosaur enterprises like the giant Ursus tractor factory - who have missed out
on the economic boom marched on Warsaw earlier this year. Will Walesa put
himself at the head of the movement of the economically disenfranchised? Will
he lead the next marches on Warsaw? Will Polish politics spill on to the
streets?
Poland's future is still very much in the hands of the defeated President. And
until Walesa's own intentions become clear there will be much to ponder.
What will Walesa do next? Can he prevent the rapid disintegration of his
electoral constituency as the post-Solidarity parties start once again to go
their own ways. Will he try to establish the effective centre-right party that
is his natural home and is missing in Poland today? Will he prepare to fight
the 1997 General Election?
Kwasniewski, meanwhile, must be aware that the lively Polish opposition and its
media will be looking closely for evidence of the abuse of power predicted by
the Walesa camp. He also, as new President, should dwell on what the closeness
of the election vote means.
A pessimistic scenario for Poland might see an embittered Walesa and
triumphalist Kwasniewski lock society in the split visions of its own past but
there is also a much more optimistic outlook, based on greater tolerance and on
self-imposed restraint given the stark alternative of Polish politics frozen in
the giant clash of symbols, ``post-Solidarity versus post-communism''.
Finally, some aspects of Polish political life are little changed by the
presidential election. These are based on real groups with particular
interests: the steel workers and coal miners mentioned earlier, farmers,
pensioners, public-sector workers, all more or less fearful for the future;
young people looking for jobs and housing, private business demanding lower
taxation, all hoping to do better out of the booming economy. Poland's real and
not symbolic politics must return to the business of finding workable
compromises between these interests.

<HEADLINE>Farmers strike pollution deal with British Coal</HEADLINE>

TENANT farmers on British Coal land in Scotland, who have spent much of this
year trying to negotiate a purchase deal with their landlord, appear to have
reached an agreement which will allow sales to go ahead.
After weeks of stalemate over who should be responsible for any future
pollution coming from mine workings on the land, farmers are claiming to have
achieved a breakthrough.
British Coal had maintained that the tenant farmers had nothing to fear and
that responsibility would remain with the new coal authority which will succeed
British Coal when it is wound up. The farmers' legal advice was that they
should seek conditions of sale which placed a binding responsibility for future
environmental pollution on British Coal or its successors.
James Wilson, of Lumphinnans Farm, Cowdenbeath, a member of the tenant farmers'
action committee, said yesterday it had reached a verbal agreement with British
Coal which was acceptable to the farmers and should permit sales to go ahead.
``We don't want to get too jubilant at the moment until we see everything in
writing,'' he said.
The sell-off of British Coal landholdings in Scotland has been a long-running
story. Initially, many of the farmers were unhappy about the prices being
demanded. They were supported by banks and other financial institutions which
indicated they were unlikely to give loans which would be incapable of
repayment on the revenue likely to be generated from the farm businesses.
After a period of negotiation many of the tenants got the price down to a level
they could expect to repay, but there were still qualms about the potential
consequences of any future pollution emanating from old mine workings.
Despite assurances from British Coal that ``certain liabilities'' would pass to
the new coal authority, the banks remained unhappy with the situation. Their
fear was that if serious pollution was to be blamed on mine workings on a farm
where they held a standard security, an injured party might decide to sue the
bank rather than the farmer. The idea of an open-ended commitment was rejected
by all the banks.
After several weeks of negotiation, it appears the farmers' legal
representatives and British Coal lawyers have managed to define conditions of
sale which would allow tenants to proceed without the fear that they would be
solely responsible for pollution problems.
A spokesman for British Coal said that throughout the UK it had achieved a
remarkably high level of agreed sales with tenant farmers - an indication, he
said, of the good value being offered.
n.GRAIN growers in the North of Scotland are using the old port at Wick to
export part of this year's harvest. A 1200-tonne cargo of feed barley was
shipped to Belfast by Dalgety. Crop marketing manager Bill Souter, from
Turriff, said: ``Shipping from Wick has proved a cost-effective alternative for
getting Caithness grain to market.''

REXAM'S shares tumbled for the second time in three months as the packaging,
paper and building products group gave another warning on profits.
The group forecast 1995 profits at around #185m compared with #231m in 1994 as
demand for paper and related products has fallen away. Sales volumes will be
lower and margins will fall to about 8%. In August the former Bowater group
warned that profits would be close to last year's figure.
Yesterday the shares lost 39p to 333p, which compares with a high for the year
of 519p.
Rexam explained that volatile raw material prices continued to have a
detrimental effect on its trading position. After disappointing third-quarter
figures, weak demand has continued into the final three months so volumes will
be well below expectations. This could account for #25m of the #46m profits
shortfall.
The speciality paper mills have suffered from high pulp prices and lower
demand. This, and sharp falls in plastic resin prices, will lead to stock
losses for 1995. Destocking is pronounced in the coated products division where
demand is below expectations, particularly in the US. However, the group added
that it had seen some signs of recovery in recent weeks.
The building products division is performing satisfactorily with the exception
of the windows business in Germany, where the building industry is in
recession. It is not exactly strong in the UK but demand paradoxically is quite
good.
Despite the generally gloomy outlook, Rexam is spending $41m on buying an
American manufacturer of lipstick cases, which are apparently a growing market.
Keven Abbott, chief executive of health and beauty packaging, commented: ``The
acquisition adds to Rexam's market and technology strengths in European
cosmetics, and gives us a highly focused North American platform from which to
serve not only the North American mass market but also the wider international
markets of key US customers.''

DEREK Stark's hopes of a Test comeback were in tatters last night after he
underwent surgery in an Edinburgh hospital.
The free-scoring Boroughmuir winger came off with a painful arm near the end of
Sunday's defeat by Watsonians, which effectively ended their Tennents title
challenge.
X-rays confirmed that he had suffered a fractured forearm, and surgeons
inserted a metal plate to help repair the bone.
'Muir coach Bruce Hay said: ``It never rains but it pours. The last few weeks
have been horrendous for us - but this is a huge blow for Derek.
``We expect him to be out of action until at least February.''
Stark, who won his four caps three years ago before going out of favour with
the selectors, launched his international comeback bid when he played for
Scotland A against Western Samoa at Hawick.
His injury almost certainly rules him out of the reckoning for the Five Nations
tournament - and he will now be setting his sights on a place in the squad to
tour New Zealand next summer.
There was better news for Hay on Kiwi lock Darren George, who accompanied Stark
to the X-ray department.
His shin injury was not a break and he could be back in action within a week or
two.
Meanwhile, former Scotland player Derek Turnbull will be in hospital for
several days after smashing a leg during Hawick's last-gasp victory over
Edinburgh Accies at the weekend.
It was confirmed as a multiple fracture, and a club official admitted: ``I
don't think he'll play again.
q CHAMPIONSHIP winners Edinburgh have eight representatives in the Scottish
Universities team for the students' opening match of the season against Glasgow
under-21s at Clarkston tomorrow evening.
Edinburgh, who defeated St Andrews 36-0 at Stirling last Wednesday to win the
universities title, supply five members of the pack including the rangy Andy
Lucking - likely to be the students' principal source of lineout possession -
and the skilful flanker, Ron Henley, both of whom had representative experience
last season. Team:
R Bailes (Edinburgh); N Hannah (Aberdeen), J Davidson (Dundee), J How
(Edinburgh), J Cadell (Aberdeen); N Paterson (Dundee), H Williams (Edinburgh);
W Mullhau (Edinburgh), S Forsyth (Aberdeen), T Cohn, A Lucking, J Hart, R
Henley (all Edinburgh), S Byrne (Heriot-Watt), C Roe (Dundee).

EUROPE'S Ryder Cup Committee are to take their time in deciding who will take
over from Bernard Gallacher as captain at Valderrama in 1997.
The American captain will be named at a news conference in Florida a week
tomorrow, with former US Open and US PGA champion Larry Nelson the favourite to
succeed Lanny Wadkins. Although the European committee meet the following day
in London, it has already been announced that no decision on the captaincy will
be made then.
After the one-point victory at Oak Hill in September, all the talk was of
Severiano Ballesteros stepping into Gallacher's shoes for the first-ever
staging of the match in Spain.
The one sticking point was whether he could be a member of the team as well as
the captain of it. There has been no player-captain on either side since Arnold
Palmer led the Americans in 1963 - when the match was not the huge sporting
occasion it is now.
Ballesteros is currently taking a five-month break from the game after having
endured one of the worst seasons of his long career. He did win the Spanish
Open in May, but by the time of the Ryder Cup his confidence was shot to pieces.
Gallacher had to leave him out of both series of foursomes and the fact that he
partnered David Gilford to a victory in the first-day fourballs spoke volumes
for his inspirational qualities - and Gilford's brilliant form.
By delaying their decision until possibly next May's Volvo PGA Championship, or
even until just before the qualifying race begins at the end of August, the
Ryder Cup Committee have given themselves the opportunity to weigh up
Ballesteros' chances of playing at Valderrama.
There are no other obvious candidates for a job which has been held by only two
men, Tony Jacklin and Gallacher, since 1983.
Manuel Pinero has acted as a kind of right-hand man to Gallacher, who did the
same for Jacklin, and could be given a role which would enable him to take on
some of the duties of the captain should Ballesteros qualify for the team.
The United States have had a change of captain for every match since Ben Hogan
was in charge of the 1947 and 1949 sides and so Lanny Wadkins is unlikely to be
given the opportunity to avenge his defeat.
Nelson was a member of the 1979, 1981, and 1987 teams. He beat Ballesteros no
fewer than four times on his debut at The Greenbrier and won his first nine cup
games before Ballesteros finally got the better of him in the foursomes at
Muirfield Village eight years ago.
The 48-year-old said last month he would be ``very interested'' in becoming
America's captain, although he does not agree with the United States'
qualifying system starting next January.

SHARE prices were at record levels yesterday after official figures showed that
the economy was growing at its slowest pace since the end of 1992, just after
the pound was forced to leave Europe's exchange rate mechanism.
The FTSE-100 share index gained 19.6 points to a 3628.8, its highest ever
closing level, on the back of the apparent settlement of the US federal
borrowing dispute and the latest economic indicators at home. At one point the
Footsie reached 3639.5, but in New York the Dow Jones was unable to establish
itself above 5000 in morning trading and closed below that level.
Growth in gross domestic product in the third quarter to the end of September
was revised down from 0.5% to 0.4%. Year-on-growth was also revised down from
2.4% to 2.1%, though part of this was attributable to upward revisions to
previous quarters.
Excluding oil and gas extraction, the economy grew at just 0.3% in the latest
quarter. The GDP figures provide the strongest indication yet that the economy
has slowed down to less than its trend rate of growth of 2.25% per annum.
Consumer spending held up well in the face of lack-lustre retail sales, but a
sharp increase in stockbuilding was a threat to future levels of activity.
Capital spending was also down sharply.
A major factor in the downward revision from the provisional figures was a 1.4%
decline in the output of the construction industries. Against the same quarter
a year ago the drop was 3.1%. Farming output also fell by 2.3% in the quarter,
but was still 2.1% higher than in the third quarter of last year.
The weaker than expected GDP numbers strengthened hopes of an early cut in
interest rates, but this was offset by Bank of England figures showing that
growth in the broad measure of the money supply was close to the upper limit of
its 3% to 9% monitoring range. Sterling's trade weighted index dropped back
from 82.3 to 82.2, another all-time low.
Industrial production increased by 0.5% in the second quarter, and its
manufacturing constituent by 0.2%. Service sector output was 0.6% higher, down
from 0.8% in the second quarter, but 3.2% higher than in the third quarter of
last year. Within this the strongest component was transport and
communications, which sported quarterly growth of 1.4% and a year-on-year
increase of 6.3%.
Consumer spending increased by 0.7% in the third quarter, a touch weaker than
the second quarter's 0.8% and well above the first quarter's 0.2%. But retail
sales were just 0.1% ahead, suggesting that spending on services is continuing
to rise strongly.
James Capel's Adam Cole said: ``Our interpretation of this remains that the
weakness of the housing market is diverting spending from durable goods towards
leisure services.''
Stockbuilding increased from #945m in the second quarter to #1438m in the third
and contributed 0.4% to the quarter's GDP. A large part of the increase is
thought to be due to retailers being caught out by the weakness of retail sales.
Higher inventory levels raised the risk that, even if final demand does hold
cup well from here, the early months of next year could see output growth
depressed as firms try to reduce stock levels, Mr Cole said.
Capital spending fell by 2.2% in the third quarter and was just 0.6% higher
than in the third quarter of last year. This is something of a puzzle since the
latest CBI survey points to continuing growth in capital spending by
manufacturers.
The pickup in the broad measure of the money supply has concerned both the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the Governor of the Bank of
England, Eddie George, at recent monthly meetings.
M4 lending to the private sector jumped from #4100m in September to #5400m last
month. Individuals appear to have lost none of their appetite for credit,
indicating that consumer spending remains strong. Broad M4 increased by 0.7%
and the annual rate of increase accelerated from 8.2% in September to 8.7%. The
corporate sector is thought to have borrowed heavily from overseas banks.
Mr Cole said: ``In the absence of October's sharp rise in bank borrowing,
downward revisions to third-quarter GDP may well have been sufficient to
justify a December base rate reduction. As it is, early next year still looks
more likely.''

NATIONAL Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley is tipping off Tory back
benchers about ways of getting National Lottery money for their constituencies,
Mr Max Madden (Bradford West - Lab.) complained to the Speaker yesterday. He
wanted such tips made available to all MPs, clearly forgetting that the
Government has a mountain to climb if it is to win the next election.
Mrs Bottomley also made a play for the hotelier vote by announcing that ``I
always spend my holidays in the UK''. Certainly, a British summer hardly seems
complete now without a photo opportunity for the extended famille Bottomley.
A barrage of Opposition criticism of the way lottery money is distributed or,
as Mr Mark Fisher (Stoke Central - Lab.) complained, not distributed very
quickly, and even a few discreet niggles from her own side, failed to shake
Virginia's pride in the whole operation, which she appears to think rivals the
feeding of the five thousand, though on a much larger scale.
Mr Dennis Skinner's opinion was, as usual, that to them that have already, more
was being given. Who were the big beneficiaries, he snarled at the lovely
Virginia. ``Sadler's Wells, Covent Garden Opera, the Churchill Papers''.
``Brass bands in coalfields don't get anything,'' he thundered, making his
cultural priorities clear. ``The whole thing's a Tory trick,'' he cried
disgustedly. He could comfort himself with the reflection that all this
trickery is doing those cunning Tories little good.
Mr Gyles Brandreth, who is rapidly overtaking Mr David Amess (Basildon - Con.)
as the Member who mentions his constituency the most, told us that millions of
tourists were pouring into the, admittedly agreeable and historic, city of
Chester. ``They visit Chester because of the quality of its democratic
representation,'' shot back Virginia flirtatiously.
Along with the millions of welcome tourists are coming tens of thousands of
less welcome bogus applicants for political asylum. Indeed, so appealing is the
quality of our democratic representation, national heritage and social security
system that the steady trickle has turned into something approaching a flood.
Mr Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, came to tell us how he proposed to repel
the flood. Angry Opposition MPs cried that this was really an attempt to play
the race card for political advantage.
Certainly the proposals do involve a ``white list'' which, if it was being
introduced by a South African government in the 1950s, might have caused
justified apprehension. It is in fact a list of states deemed to be politically
stable and, therefore, unlikely to oblige anyone to flee from them in fear of
his life for political reasons. Nonetheless, if a Swiss, for example, is able
to demonstrate that he is in danger of being flung over the Matterhorn by his
normally stable government, he will be granted asylum.
Mr Gordon Brown, having unveiled his 10p (or perhaps 15p) new low rate of
income tax aspiration, Labour had clearly exhausted its policy-making potential
for the day.
Anyway, looking for Labour's policy on the Immigration and Asylum Bill soon
resembled a game of hunt-the-parcel without the parcel.
Mr Jack Straw, Shadow Home Secretary, was clear that Labour also opposed bogus
asylum-seekers and devoted most of the rest of his remarks to the need for a
special standing committee which could take evidence on the proposals before
getting round to voting on them.
``A diversionary tactic,'' said Mr Howard, clearly enjoying himself almost as
much as in the prisons debate in which Mr Straw censured him and virtually
everyone else censured Mr Straw's speech.
Mr Howard probably rightly divined that Mr Blair does not want to look soft on
bogus asylum-seekers but wants to be able to go on sounding compassionate as
well. The Opposition tactic probably will be to criticise the Bill in detail
without offering a detailed alternative. After all, as the Government finds
weekly and Mr Brown has discovered a couple of times recently, having a policy
is a dangerous policy.

A LEADING sports company is to consider backing the eight-stage
Edinburgh-to-Glasgow road race should the current sponsors decide not to
exercise their option to continue, writes Doug Gillon.
The 65-year-old race, won on Sunday by Leslie Deans Racing Club for a
record-equalling fifth successive year, has been supported for the past 17
winters by the soft drinks company, Barrs. But their latest five-year
agreement, worth #10,000, has now ended, prompting concerns by competitors
about the future of the event.
A spokesman for Mizuno, who back several races in England, but none in
Scotland, confirmed yesterday that if the race does become available, they
would be interested in looking at proposals from the Scottish Athletic
Federation's road and cross-country commission. The race, highlight of the
winter road season, involves the country's leading 20 teams, and is by
invitation only.
``We will be talking to Barrs in the near future,'' said SAF president Peter
Carton last night. ``We have enjoyed excellent relations with them over the
years, but this is an important event for the sport, and we want to secure its
future.
``The race would go ahead irrespective of sponsorship, but we would like to
maintain it in some style. It's very gratifying to learn that other companies
are prepared to put money into Scottish athletics.''

A ``CA' CANNY'' ap-proach might seem at odds with the common belief that the
offshore oil industry thrives on risk-taking. However, in the tradition of many
famous Scottish inventions, modern engineering breakthroughs often owe as much
to dedication and hard graft as to the spark of genius.
Because of unrelenting commercial pressures, the demands on the expertise of
the engineers have never been greater. The result has been a concerted effort
from the whole offshore industry to exploit to the full the pool of skills at
hand.
Amid the groundswell of technological and operational change, how have training
programmes for engineers kept pace with the fluid needs of the sector? At the
outset, two factors which have a bearing on the answer need to be considered.
Firstly, the engineering interests present in the offshore industry continue to
be represented first and foremost by their own professional bodies. Although
each of these promotes activities for its members working in the sector, there
is no central authority whose primary task is to coordinate the spectrum of
engineering groupings.
When all the other interests, covering the offshore contracting and service
companies, are taken into account, there are 157 occupational bodies with
engineering connections.
The second factor is the predominance of partnership and alliance arrangements
between oil companies and operators in respect of the management of offshore
work.
In Heriot-Watt University's prospectus, Solutions for the Oil and Gas Industry,
John Shute, of Enterprise Oil, comments: ``Traditional boundaries are being
dismantled and individuals are often required to work outside their functional
disciplines. In this environment, the need for further education and training
is being emphasised; not only to expose existing professionals to new fields
but also to keep experts abreast of technological advances.''
Given the general practice for energy companies to be headed by engineers, the
development of all-round skills has always been viewed as a vital component in
the career development process. Professor Gareth Owen of the Civil and Offshore
Engineering Department at Heriot-Watt University is encouraged by the current
debate prompted by the Engineering Council for the enhancement of training
within the profession. He is convinced of the need for post-qualifying training
as a means of setting a uniform standard of excellence within the various
chartered institutes.
A successful model is his own department's Integrated Graduate Development
Scheme (IGDS), which links a series of short modular courses to an MSc in
Underwater Technology and Subsea Engineering.
Aimed at graduate engineers who wish to improve their qualifications while
remaining in full-time employment, the course offers 10 modules (each of a
week), ranging from specific technical areas to more general issues such as
risk, reliability and safety. The final part of the course, to be completed
within three years, is a company-based project.
It is a sign of the university's appreciation of the need to provide such
courses for engineering graduates that postgraduates' awards outnumbered
undergraduate ones ones in 1993/94.
Professor Owen is confident that the momentum from the Engineering and Science
Research Councils for improvements to the framework of professional and career
develop- ment can be maintained. But he cautions that there is no room for
companies to weaken their resolve to the strategic role of training.
If the standard of training in the offshore sector can be judged from the
diversity of provision, the prospects look healthy. Shell Expro, for example,
with an annual intake of 60 engineering graduates, uses external training
providers for around 70% of its training needs.
Head of Training and Development at Shell Expro in Aberdeen, Peter Crowther
says that ``off-the-shelf'' courses are of greatest benefit for promoting
management development and supervisory skills. He continues: ``If necessary, we
will   tailor existing packages slightly to suit our own specific needs.
``Feedback from our graduates on courses run by local training providers has
been positive. Also, we can rely more on local providers to quote exact
up-front total costs.''
The main criterion for Shell Expro in determining training needs is adding
value at the workplace.
To this end, the company is offering financial incentives to training providers
of selected programmes where managers of delegates recognise quantifiable
efficiency benefits resulting from their attendance on courses.
On the effect of outsourcing greater responsibility to contractors, Peter
Crowther says that the training budget for his own staff has been maintained.
He explains: ``We believe we have now got multi-skilling at the right level.
Our own skills training has shifted to mastering the electronic-based
technology required to operate the third generation style of platforms.''
With increasing recognition being given to the skills of contractors in the
offshore sector, there can be no let-up in promoting the benefits of training
to sustain progress.

ALMOST half of the gains posted by Foreign &amp; Colonial Eurotrust in the year to
September 30 were generated by the pound's depreciation against Continental
currencies.
Although the trust's net assets per share increased 13.5% to 258.4p, Foreign &amp;
Colonial still underperformed its benchmark - the FT-Actuaries Europe Index
recorded a 15.7% rise in assets per share during the same period.
The trust, whose largest portfolios are in France, Germany, the Netherlands and
Switzerland, saw a 11.9% increase in pre-tax revenue to #1.65m. Total assets
were up 14.5% to #161.1m.
Trust director Stephen White said part of the reason Foreign &amp; Colonial lagged
behind its benchmark was because of poor market performance in France, where
the trust has 23.6% of its portfolio invested.
The Paris Government's franc fort policy, which ties the value of the French
currency to that of the German mark, has not decreased interest rates as much
as was anticipated, Mr White said. That has hampered equity market returns, but
there are signs that French interest rates are beginning to fall.
``It's still a very big market,'' Mr White said. ``We see the possibility for
the corporate market there to do better in the future.''
The Italian and Spanish markets, both beset by political concerns, also dragged
down the trust's overall performance. Together the two countries represent
12.7% of Foreign &amp; Colonial investments.
During the year to September 30, investments in France, Italy and Spain were
``trimmed'' while holdings in Sweden and Finland were built up. The
international demand for technology-related stocks helped both Scandinavian
countries to ``outstanding performances'' last year.
Mr White said the trust sees little change in the European outlook for the
current year. Slowing business activity and uncertainty over the dollar are
likely to lead to downward revisions in corporate earnings forcasts, he said.
``On balance, we look for the year ahead to have reasonable returns on the
market,'' he said, ``but like this year, it won't be spectacular.''

<HEADLINE>UA gives lifeline to Hamilton's</HEADLINE>

SCOTLAND'S second largest auction company, Perth-based United Auctions, is set
to establish a joint venture with the troubled firm of Hamilton's Auction Mart
which operates in the North of Scotland, principally at Thurso, as well as
holding a 53% stake in Huntly Auction Mart.
Last year Hamilton's returned a loss of #109,045 following an even worse set of
accounts in the previous year with a loss of almost #189,000.
No dividend has been paid to shareholders for some years and its latest
accounts have not yet been published.
Earlier this year the managing director of Hamilton's, Ewen Macarthur, died
suddenly throwing the company's future further into doubt, especially since a
loan of #1.5m from the TSB bank was due to be repaid in May. In his last
statement to shareholders, Mr Macarthur announced there was no immediate
prospect of that deadline being met and that the bank had granted an extension
of the loan dependent on the realisation of property in Inverness for
redevelopment.
For a period UA operated in tandem with Hamilton's in Inverness but it
subsequently linked up with Dingwall Mart in a joint venture.
In the last set of accounts available, Hamilton's paid #194,205 in interest
charges, while the balance of assets over liabilities fell from #244,899 to
#133,155.
However, better trading conditions were predicted for the second half of 1994
and the first six months of 1995.
The North and North-east of Scotland provide a huge reservoir of livestock,
particularly store cattle and sheep, and in recent years selling has tended to
be concentrated in major centres such as A&amp;N Group's Thainstone Agricultural
Centre at Inverurie.
These premises have recently been extended to cope with record numbers of
animals.
When Thainstone opened A&amp;N rationalised its centres, including closing down its
mart in Huntly. This provoked an outcry and eventually local farmers and small
businesses put up money to build a new mart which was run by Hamilton's. A&amp;N
has in more recent times put pressure on rival firms by building new premises
in Elgin and establishing a centre at Quoybrae in Caithness.
At the same time, UA has made major financial progress, cutting its overdraft
from #8m to around #3m, pulling out of the loss making Oban mart and realising
non-productive assets. Recently UA shares gained a listing on the Alternative
Investment Market and since then they have increased considerably in value.
Lairg in Sutherland is UA's most northerly outpost, but it has been an open
secret that the firm was keen to expand its business in the North through
further joint ventures which will allow smaller and more vulnerable marts to
remain broadly in the control of local farmer shareholders.
A formal announcement confirming the deal with Hamilton's is expected later
this week.

THE like of it Northern Ireland will never have experienced before. On the
morning of November 30, Air Force One, carrying President Bill Clinton, should
touch down at Belfast's Aldergrove airport for a day of pre-Christmas spectacle
and emotion.
The city's largest exhibition and concert venue, the King's Hall, is being
converted into a giant press centre. America's major television networks are
already in town making final preparations to beam the President's historic
visit to as many as one billion viewers around the world.
Outside Belfast City Hall, an elaborate redesign of the surrounding gardens,
pavements, and railings is almost complete. A special plinth marking the spot
where General Eisenhower paid a post-war visit, before his presidency, should
have the name of Bill Clinton added to it next week. The city centre is said to
be crawling with American Secret Service agents examining manhole covers and
office blocks. The nearby Europa Hotel, once deemed the most bombed hostelry in
the Western world, now waits to house its most famous guests of all, the
President and First Lady of the United States of America.
With only nine days left to the visit, two major ingredients are still missing
- the Christmas tree, which the President will light personally as a symbol of
goodwill and, more embarrassingly, any sign of a breakthrough in Ulster's
political deadlock that would signify the spirit of the season.
It seems the presidential Christmas tree has been covered to date in more red
tape than tinsel. Apparently not satisfied with a simple spruce from a forest
park in Ulster, the Americans are flying their very own tree all the way from
Vice-President Al Gore's Nashville Tennessee estate, on board a Galaxy
transport aircraft.
The problems surrounding its importation have been such as to require the
earnest endeavours of British, American, and even EU officials, but, at least,
they appear to have reached a settlement, which is more than can be said for
Ulster's divided politicians.
Despite all the persuasive efforts of the White House, the so-called peace
process has proved an exasperating exercise. Clinton's ability to influence
progress with either Unionists or nationalists has been limited despite months
of transatlantic diplomacy.
Virtually every leading player has been to the White House and some have even
had audiences with the President himself. The most senior figures in the US
administration have applied their minds to the problems of Northern Ireland.
But, still, the deadlock over IRA weapons remains.
While the Middle East and Bosnia are issues of global dimension to Washington,
the small scale of Northern Ireland's conflict makes it no easier to solve.
Mistrust poisons the political atmosphere. Age-old suspicions run just as deep
in Belfast as Sarajevo.
The White House stepped up its role as peace broker in Ulster when the IRA
announced its ceasefire on August 31 last year and Loyalists followed suit six
weeks later. That said, officially, the Americans avoid expressing opinions
that are ahead of current British or Irish Government policy.
While some Tories at Westminster may rail occasionally at what they see as
undue interference in UK affairs, the fact is that Washington is deeply
embroiled with a whole spectrum of political views. The Clinton administration,
despite the green Irish-American influence within the Democratic camp, has even
developed an inside track relationship with some Unionists and Loyalists.
In the past month, the new leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, David Trimble,
led a delegation to meet the President. Loyalist hardliners ranging from the
political spokesmen of extremist groups to Ian Paisley have gone to the White
House. The toing and froing across the Atlantic has intensified as next week's
first-ever presidential visit to Northern Ireland nears.
In Ulster, much preparatory work has gone on behind closed doors. The
President's adviser, Nancy Soderberg, affectionately nicknamed ``Nancy Soda
bread'' in Belfast, has twisted and turned through a political maze searching
for answers that might comfort Clinton as he heads towards Belfast on Air Force
One.
The input of American ambassadors to London and Dublin, Admiral William Crowe
and Mrs Jean Kennedy-Smith, is also crucial. Crowe appears to have won the
confidence of many British MPs, including Tories and Unionists, while
Kennedy-Smith, sister of Edward, is constantly sounding out Irish nationalist
opinion and feeding her views to the White House.
It was Kennedy-Smith and Soderberg who are believed to have persuaded the
President to grant a visa to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and to welcome him to
the White House, despite the annoyance of the British Government and Unionists
in Ulster. Bringing Adams and Sinn Fein in from the cold was Clinton's most
significant early contribution to the Ulster peace process but it was soon
clear that this would not be enough.
With Adams on board, the Americans turned more attention to wooing Unionists
but found little enthusiasm. The former Ulster Unionist leader, James
Molyneaux, preferred a stay-at-home profile at Westminster or, as he put it, no
``high-wire acts''.
When Clinton hosted a major investment conference on Northern Ireland in June,
Molyneaux was conspicious by his absence and his party was represented only by
a low-level delegation.
The Americans have provided a number of milestone events since the ceasefire. A
year ago, Prime Minister John Major and the US Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown,
attended an investment conference at Belfast's Europa Hotel. Each spoke
glowingly of the other's commitment to the peace process. Their common message
was that a new dawn was breaking for Northern Ireland after 25 years of
violence and the United States would promote more inward investment and play a
diplomatic role in the search for political agreement.
By springtime, the initial euphoria surrounding the ceasefire had given way to
sombre realism. The IRA and Loyalist extremists still had all their weaponry
while calls for all-party talks were ignored. Clinton's handshake with Gerry
Adams at the White House on St Patrick's Day soured relations with Unionists.
By the summer, however, the President had struck a better balance, welcoming
hundreds of leading political and business figures to Washington for an
investment conference on Ulster as unprecedented as his visit next week.
Politicians with deep differences were bused together to the White House. Some
displayed a rare mood of conviviality. Unionists and nationalists even engaged
in good-natured banter and the singing of party songs on late-night journeys
back to their hotels from the White House functions.
Each major American occasion is intended as a stimulant to permanent peace in
Ulster but the early expectations for the President's visit have run into sand.
Instead of highlighting progress, Clinton's visit runs the risk of emphasising
the deadlock that all the efforts of Washington, London, and Dublin have failed
to resolve.
The bottom line for Unionists is that they will not engage in all-party talks
which would include Sinn Fein until the IRA hand over some if not all their
arms and show more evidence that their ceasefire is permanent.
The bottom line for Sinn Fein and the IRA is that guns and bombs will not be
handed over in advance of such talks, if at all. All-party talks should have no
such pre-condition, Sinn Fein argues.
Though everyone recognises the import of the historic presidential visit, all
the transatlantic diplomacy of recent weeks has proved fruitless. Now attention
turns to an exchange of correspondence between John Major and the Irish leader,
John Bruton. If the two men are to hold a mini-summit and to agree on a
facesaving compromise, they are leaving it late.
The best chance of a deal still rests with the so-called ``twin-track'' policy,
which foresees an international arms commission starting to examine the
``decommissioning'' of terrorist weapons, while, at the same time, a new round
of exploratory talks taking place between all Ulster's parties, including Sinn
Fein.
For example, the procedure might have a three-month deadline by which time the
arms commission would produce concrete proposals on neutralising weapons such
as guns and bombs. Full round-table talks would then take place if the arms
commission produced satisfactory proposals.
There remains an outside chance that a deal such as this could be struck
between London and Dublin within the next few days. Whether Sinn Fein, the
Loyalists, or Unionists would abide by it is very much in doubt at this late
stage.
The President is still assured of a warm welcome. Care has been taken by his
advisers to plan a ``balanced'' schedule of events, that Unionists and
nationalists alike can enjoy, even if this means Clinton paying visits to
different and divided areas.
Without agreement on arms and talks, the visit loses much of its political edge
for Clinton. But with Christmas just around the corner, the switching on of the
Tennessee tree outside Belfast City Hall will still be a moving and symbolic
gesture for Northern Ireland and many other parts of the world where violence
has destroyed so much.

DOWNING Gray, only the fourth American to carry the dubious distinction of
having led a defeated United States Walker Cup team, as he did when Britain and
Ireland won 14-10 at Royal Porthcawl in September, has nevertheless been
reappointed captain for the thirty-sixth match, to be played on August 9 and
10, 1997, at the Quaker Ridge club in Scarsdale, New York.
Gray, aged 56 and who himself played in three matches in the 1960s, was widely
held to have been tactically naive in playing his two strongest players, Tiger
Woods and John Harris, in the last two singles on the second day. Both won, but
by then the match, as a contest, was over. Gray, surely, will be anxious not to
waste the second chance he has been given.
As regards the captaincy of the combined side, George Macgregor, chairman of
the Royal and Ancient Club's selection committee, said yesterday that he
expected Clive Brown, who made such a good job of his responsibilities in his
native country of Wales, would ``be in harness next season'' and that, in
accordance with established practice, he would again be in charge in two years'
time.
q GORDON Gray, the professional at Dumfries and County, shot a closing 69 over
Peralda, Spain, to claim his card for the 1996 European Seniors' Tour. The
Scot, who coaches Andrew Coltart, a member of Scotland's first Dunhill
Cup-winning team, finished six behind top qualifier, Manuel Alvarez, of the
host country.
The number of countries being visited by Europe's golfers has grown even more
with the news that a seniors' event is to be played in Turkey. Prize-money of
around #100,000 will be offer in the Oger Tours Turkish Seniors Open at the
National Golf Club in Antalya on May 6 to 12. Ryder Cup player David Feherty
and his fellow Ulsterman David Jones designed the course.
Leading scores from Peralda (GB unless stated):
213 - M Alvarez (Spain) 74, 69, 70. 214 - R Whitehead 73, 70, 71. 216 - R
Bernardini (Italy) 72, 73, 71; K Magnusson (Sweden) 72, 71, 73. 218 - H Fraser
(USA) 72, 72, 74; H Schumacher (Switzerland) 72, 71, 75. 219 - G Gray 75, 75,
69; T Squires 73, 74, 72.

AT LEAST one person was killed in Cyprus when a bomb ripped through a block of
flats housing cabaret entertainers in the port town of Larnaca.
The bomb exploded in a first-floor apartment of a building near the port at
11pm tonight, killing a Cypriot man and injuring many people. The victim's body
was thrown out of the apartment by the explosion to the road below.
Reports that a foreign woman was found dead in the debris of the apartment have
not been confirmed.
The bombing was the latest in a series of violent incidents that rocked the
eastern Mediterranean holiday island over the past six months as organised
crime has soared.
Police suspect two local gangs are vying for control of nightclubs and the
employment of foreign entertainers on the island. Most of them are from Eastern
European countries.
Police are assessing information that the bomb was thrown on the apartment's
balcony from a passing vehicle.
Witnesses reported chaos at the scene as rescue teams working in heavy rain
began to sift debris to pinpoint the injured.
Police found an improvised bomb made of 6lb of dynamite under the seat of a
motorcycle in the same apartment complex last week, defusing it before it could
go off. One suspect is in custody.-Reuter.

GUERRILLAS holding four Westerners hostage in Kashmir offered today to free two
sick captives in exchange for a jailed militant, raising hopes of a
breakthrough in the four-month ordeal.
``It is true they are asking for a limited swop,'' said a government official.
Al-Faran militants had in recent days seemed eager to exchange one or two
ailing hostages for a smaller number of jailed separatists than the 15 they had
previously demanded, said the official.
``This time they are saying `We will release two of them. Why not release one
of our colleagues'. They are sending baits of this kind,'' he added.
It was not clear if the Indian Government would agree to the latest demand.
Britons Keith Mangan and Paul Wells, American Donald Hutchings, and German Dirk
Hasert were kidnapped by Al-Faran militants while trekking in the Himalayan
region in July.
A fifth captive, Norwegian Hans Christian Ostroe, was found beheaded on August
13.
Last week the guerrillas said one of the captives, who was not identified,
could die at ``any time'' and urged his family to come to the Himalayan region
as soon as possible.
United News of India (UNI) reported today that Al-Faran told a government
negotiator by telephone that they were willing to release Mr Hutchings, known
to be suffering from frostbite, and an ailing British hostage who was not
named, in exchange for an unidentified militant.
A diplomat said no members of the hostages' families had been called to India
as it was not certain any of the captives would be freed.
However, an official in Jammu and Kashmir state said there could be a deal
involving at least one of the hostages this week. ``Contacts have become more
frequent,'' one official said. ``I think it's hopeful.''-Reuter.

A WOMAN accused of killing a pregnant mother and two of her children and then
cutting out a full-term foetus was feigning pregnancy so that she could claim
the unborn baby as her own, a Chicago court was told.
Prosecutor John Kinsella told an arraignment hearing that Deborah Evans was
dead or dying when her unborn son, who survived the ordeal and has been named
Elijah, was crudely removed from her body.
One of three accused in the killing, Jacqueline Williams, was preparing to take
Elijah as her own child and was staging a bogus pregancy to set the scene, he
said. Williams, 28, her boyfriend Fedell Caffey, 22, and Evans's ex-boyfriend
Levern Ward were remanded in custody on charges of killing Evans and her
children Samantha, 10, and Joshua, eight, at their home.
Samantha was stabbed to death in the apartment and Joshua's body was found in
an alley nearby. Another of Evans' children, 19-month-old Jordan, was unharmed,
although he saw his mother's murder.
Prosecutors say they will ask for the death penalty.
Williams, who has three other children, was unable to have children with
Caffey, providing the motive for the attack, investigators said.
Police said Ward, 24, was the father of Jordan, and may also be the father of
Elijah.
Elijah, in good condition at a Chicago hospital, will probably end up with
Evans' relatives along with Jordan.-Reuter.

WORLD and Olympic skating champion Sergei Grinkov collapsed and died of a heart
attack today while skating with his wife during a practice. He was 28.
Grinkov fell to the ice while lifting his wife, Yekaterina Gordeeva, at the
Olympic Ice arena, where they were in their second year of the ``Stars On Ice''
programme.
Grinkov and his wife were twice world champions and won Olympic gold for pairs
figure skating in 1988 and 1994.
The ``G and G'' duo helped revolutionise pairs figure skating both artistically
and athletically. Grinkov was a body-builder, who was able to lift his 6st 4lb
partner high off the ice.
As with all Russian pairs and dance teams, they studied ballet along with
skating. Their classic ballet training was evident in their hands, facial
expressions, and body moves, with one element flowing into another with
elegance and beauty.
They met at a Moscow skating club when Gordeeva was four. Their coaches paired
them in 1982 when she was 11 and he was 15.
They won their first world championship in 1986 and two years later won gold in
the Winter Olympics at Calgary. He was only 20, she just 16.
After turning professional following the 1988 Games, they began dating in 1989
and married in 1991. Their daughter Daria was born in 1992.-AP.

<HEADLINE>AA calls for 10mph limit</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>2</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975274184</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SPEED limits on some city centre roads should be cut to 10mph, the Automobile
Association said yesterday.
The motoring association said the reduced limit could cut drastically the
160,000 injury accidents in urban areas every year.
The reduction from 30mph should apply at accident black-spots like schools,
hospitals, town centres, and roads without pavements.
Experts from the AA have studied a similar scheme in Denmark, where traffic
speed has been cut to 10mph on a housing estate where pedestrians and motorists
share the road.
The motoring group says more than half of all road accidents in which someone
is injured occur on urban roads with a 30mph limit.
Mr Andrew Howard, head of road safety at the AA, said yesterday: ``We would not
want to see a blanket reduction from 30mph to 10mph in urban areas.
``After all, it is quite difficult to drive at 10mph, which is about the speed
a jogger runs.
``But in certain areas where there are traffic-calming schemes we would like to
see the speed limit reduced.
``In areas where roads are being shared by pedestrians, cyclists, children,
motorbikes, and cars, a reduction in speed can make all the difference.
``One in 20 pedestrians would be killed if hit by a car travelling at 20mph -
but 45% would die if hit by a car at 30mph.
``That is the difference that 10mph can make.''
There are 316,000 road accidents a year in Britain, 3600 of them fatal, and
more than half are in urban areas like main streets.
The AA says most fatal accidents occur within two miles of a driver starting
his or her journey.
Mr Howard said: ``It is the wrong speed in these urban areas that is the
problem.''

IT IS the time of year when the vexed debate about comparative tables of school
performance starts to generate heat again. Today we publish, on a
school-by-school basis, the results of the 1995 examinations for the Scottish
Certificate of Education (SCE), and also of qualifications awarded by the
Scottish Vocational Education Council (Scotvec).
The tables do not contain information on exams such as A-Levels organised by
English awarding bodies, though some of the Scottish independent schools
present pupils for these.
It is important to consider the two sets of data together, since the Scottish
Examination Board, which administers the SCE examinations, is responsible for
national academic awards, Scotvec for the corresponding vocational awards.
The SEB offers recognition at three levels - Standard Grade, Higher Grade and
the Certificate of Sixth Year Studies - and our tables Standard and Higher
Grade results.
Pupils sit Standard Grade exams towards the end of fourth year, and most
subjects include elements which are internally assessed by the teacher and
externally moderated by the SEB. By its sub-division into three levels -
Credit, General and Foundation - Standard Grade caters for pupils of widely
differing achievement. In today's tables Standard Grade 1-2 represents Credit
level, 3-4 General level.
Highers are taken in fifth and sixth year. The SEB has introduced a Revised
Higher format to ensure closer articulation with Standard Grade. In some Higher
subjects elements of the syllabus are now assessed outwith formal exam
conditions, with pupils' own project material submitted to the SEB as a
portfolio for marking.
The banding system for Higher Grade awards is:
A 70-100%
B 60-69%
C 50-59%
D 40-49%
If the pupil's mark is below 40%, no result is recorded.
The Certificate of Sixth Year Studies is intended for pupils who remain at
school after achieving Highers or approved groups of Scotvec modules. It is not
available in all subjects but pupils who undertake CSYS study often see it as a
bridge between school and higher education.
The Scotvec data relates to its National Certificate modules. These are units
of learning which notionally require 40 hours' study and can be taken on their
own or along with other modules and SCE courses to form coherent packages.
Unlike SCE exams, Scotvec awards are not subject to terminal examinations but
are based on assessment by the teacher, coupled with checking procedures by
Scotvec to ensure that quality and standards are maintained.
The tables of results indicate that the percentage of pupils achieving 3+
Highers (20%) and 5+ Highers (6%) is the same as last year. On the other hand,
the proportion of S4 pupils gaining 5+ Standard Grades at Credit level has
risen from 25% to 27%, having stood at 23% only two years ago.
The tables are useful in depicting how individual schools are performing. When
they are used for comparison, however, the statutory health warning must apply.
Comparing the SCE results of one school directly with another can be a
misleading exercise, since like is not being compared with like.
The statistics do not allow for social, economic, geographical or other factors
which can influence performance. This is widely acknowledged and the Scottish
Office is funding large-scale research which may help to specify the elements
which constitute a good school.
Ideally, this would mean comparing the raw material which a school receives
with the final product - the school leaver - thereby identifying the value
which the school adds. In terms of SCE exams, breaking down the value-added
element might involve a sophisticated comparison of Standard Grade and Higher
results.
The validity of the awards which we highlight today is not affected by plans to
reform upper secondary education in Scotland through Higher Still proposals.
This is due to be implemented in 1998, with a new, unified system of curriculum
and assessment which is designed to achieve equal status for SEB and Scotvec
courses.
Highers will be offered in modular form and the CSYS will be replaced by new
Advanced Highers, though Highers are expected to remain the benchmark for entry
to higher education. Last week's Queen's Speech also foreshadowed the coming
merger of the SEB and Scotvec, with the new body taking over responsibility for
the single certificate to be developed under the Higher Still arrangements.
While our tables will therefore assume a quite different format in a few years,
another change which they will undergo is much closer. Local government reform
in Scotland takes effect next April and the 1996 results will be grouped
according to the boundaries of the new unitary councils.

THERE are published statistics and there are useful statistics. The tables
which we publish today give details of the performance of pupils in Standard
Grade and Higher examinations over the last three years. They allow some
general trends to be gleaned from what is, essentially, raw data.
But, as far as secondary headteachers are concerned, the really useful figures
come in the form of data, also from the Scottish Office, which allows them to
measure how far they have taken their pupils on by using their performance at
Standard Grade to predict how they will fare at Higher Grade, and comparing
that prediction with actual performance.
The comparison allows schools to gauge how much value they have added to their
pupils' experience in school, at least between Standard Grade and Higher exam
performance. A grade point analysis is used to give pupils a rating, based on
their Standard Grade results at the top credit, the middle general, and the
lowest foundation levels.
They go from one and two for credit to five and six at foundation level, so the
better a pupil does across subjects, the lower his or her overall rating will
be, and the better he or she will be expected to do at Higher Grade.
The Scottish Office uses the analysis to supply secondaries with standard
tables, which allows them to establish if their pupils are indeed making as
much progress compared with those who are starting from the same point - their
prior attainment at Standard Grade.
The tables are used to show how pupils have peformed, like with like, across
Scotland, and by subject department. If a school's pupils have made
better-than-average progress in the Higher results than those with similar
prior attainment, it gets a positive rating, but if it has done less well its
rating is negative.
Talks are under way to find a way to make such value-added initiatives
available and understandable to parents. Doug Marr, headteacher of Banchory
Academy in Aberdeenshire, one of Scotland's high-achieving schools, believes
value-added information is important, and should be more widely available.
``Value-added tables are worth a great deal because they give us a much better
impression of what is happening in our schools,'' he said. ``They tell school
managements a great deal which is not reflected in the exam results tables.''
Phil Austin, principal teacher of biology at Banchory Academy, has adapted
grade point analysis to help fourth-year pupils choose their Higher subjects.
They are given a rating based on their performance in their Standard Grade
prelim exams. The lower their rating, the more Highers they are expected to
take in fifth year.
The system is about to be used formally for the first time by guidance staff to
help fourth year pupils decide how many Highers to take next year. It has to be
based on prelim results because Higher courses start immediately after the
Standard Grade exams end.
It has been used informally, and based on Mr Austin's analysis, it has been
useful and accurate in predicting performance at Higher. Also, the school has
found that the more Highers a pupil is encouraged to take, the better he or she
does. Mr Marr puts this down to raising pupil expectations and challenging them
more. He accepts that value-added measures have their limitations because pupil
year groups have different strengths and weaknesses. He believes, however, that
they should be developed, particularly if a way can be found to give a fuller
picture of how schools bring pupils on - perhaps by using the attainment levels
in the programme for 5-to 14-year-olds as a starting point in the first year of
secondary schooling.
And he believes that such information should be shared with parents, who are
much more aware of the limitations of raw results. ``Parents are becoming much
more sophisticated. The vast majority realise that schools are not all starting
from the same place so any results have to judged on the environment of each
particular school, its circumstances, and the different intake from year to
year.''
Professor John MacBeath, director of the Quality in Education research centre
at Strathclyde University, also has concerns about the pursuit of the ``holy
grail'' of value-added leading Scottish education down a narrow road of
measuring specific forms of attainment.
``Value-added has to mean a great deal more. It has to refer to those things
which are seen as lying at the heart of effective, or `good', schools,'' he
said. Professor MacBeath detects a large measure of agreement on that point.
When work was being done to identify factors which made schools happy and
successful places, teachers, pupils, and parents agreed on a set of priorities.
Such schools should be safe and secure; they should promote health and be free
of bullying and drugs; their teachers should support and challenge pupils and
form relationships which encourage the sharing of problems in school, at home,
and with friends.
Good schools were satisfying places to be which produced good results among
other factors, said Professor MacBeath.
The centre is currently looking at the bigger picture in a project on improving
the effectiveness of schools which it is conducting on behalf of the Scottish
Office. Many Scottish schools are taking part in the project, which involves
assessing value-added not just in relation to attainment, but also in such
areas as enjoyment of school, self-confidence and self-esteem, support for
learning at home, and achievements across a spectrum of activities and
interests.
Teacher morale and job satisfaction are also being measured because, as
Professor MacBeath says: ``The quality of the school rests more than any other
single factor on their morale and motivation and how the school is able to
sustain that. A good school is, by general agreement, one where there are
collaborative relationships among teachers, where they share their problems and
successes.''
If educational values are to be properly measured, argues Professor MacBeath,
they must include ``those people who have the most immediate investment in
educational success and who pay the highest price for educational failure, that
is pupils, teachers, and parents.
``Information on how well the school is performing ought, therefore, to reflect
more directly the priorities of these `stakeholders' who have a close and
day-to-day involvement in the school and who, in a real sense, are the school.''

THIS year's results confirm one fact that we probably all knew already, writes
DICK LOUDEN. Competent teachers and supportive parents add to the effectiveness
of a school, but it is the quality of the pupils themselves which has the
biggest impact on a school's exam results in any given year.
The perfect example of this is provided by St Bride's High in East Kilbride.
The percentage of fifth-year pupils gaining 3+ Highers at A-C in 1993 was 33%.
Last year it was 26%. Now it has soared to 40%. ``We tend to have jagged-line
results,'' says head teacher Stephen McPartlin. ``We were expecting good
results this time, because we knew it was a particularly good year group. Their
Standard Grade results last year were extremely good.''
When a year group stands out like this, it leads to stronger motivation all
round. ``Though we devote equal attention to all our classes - our learning and
teaching and homework policies apply to everybody - able classes drive the
teachers,'' Mr McPartlin explains.
``The parents push the children more as well, and the pupils provide a stimulus
for one another. If it is a poorish year group, there is more pressure on
teachers, especially the guidance teams, who spend more time chasing up matters
like attendance.''
Anderson High School in Lerwick produces consistently high results at Higher
Grade each year. This year 53% of fifth-year pupils achieved 3 or more Highers
at A-C. Head teacher Ian Spence sees his school's achievement as a
``self-fulfilling prophecy''. In other words, ``getting good results one year
leads to good results another year''.
Unlike many other rural schools, Anderson High does not owe its success to a
small intake skewing the quality of the results. It has almost 1000 pupils who,
according to Mr Spence, are ``keen to learn''. The entire community is behind
the school, with the staff and Shetland Islands Council also earning the head
teacher's praise for their supportive contribution.
``It all goes together to produce a positive ethos,'' he says. ``It's quite
easy to cultivate an ethos in rural areas like this. You can operate in a
particular way - we work in a very relaxed atmosphere here. I have to travel
further down through the country to see how different life can be.
``We have our social problems, of course, but against that our staff know the
community well and live in it. I'm not just viewed as a man in a suit - when I
go shopping for a garden spade on a Saturday, wearing casual gear, I'm seen in
that light.''
Apart from variations in quality between year groups within the same school,
there can also be changes caused by legislation. Bearsden Academy, which headed
the tables last year in terms of Higher results, has seen the percentage of
pupils achieving 3+ Highers at A-C drop from 55% to 45%. This can be largely
attributed to the impact of numerous placing requests a few years ago from
peripheral areas of Glasgow and Dunbarton division.
One of the most heartening sets of results comes from Lochend Secondary in the
Easterhouse area of Glasgow. Highlighted as an improving school by Her
Majesty's Inspectorate in September, it has achieved an increase in pupils
gaining 5+ Standard Grades at 1-4 from 28% to 38%.
Head teacher Allan Murray points out that the school's pass rate in 1+ Highers
at A-C has also risen from 6% in 1993 to 12% now, but accepts that the S4 year
group which achieved such a significant improvement was one of above-average
ability for the school.

WE tend to assume that the payment of school fees will be rewarded with
high-quality exam performance, writes DICK LOUDEN, and the table of results for
independent schools makes impressive reading.
Yet the body representing 80% of schools in the sector - the Scottish Council
of Independent Schools (SCIS) - is careful to place exam performance in a wider
context. In its advice to parents, it states: ``How good are the exam results?
Every parent wants to know the answer to this question. But exam results are
not everything and they are not necessarily the best way of judging how well a
school is doing.''
Rose Bell, information officer of SCIS, identifies these parental priorities:
``They expect classes to be small. They want an atmosphere sympathetic to the
education they are seeking, which may be either a structured traditional
approach to the curriculum or a more relaxed ambiance in which the expressive
arts flourish.''
Other factors are the range of extra-curricular activities on offer and the
emphasis placed on personal qualities.
Anne Ritchie, Scottish director of the Independent Schools Careers
Organisation, says that the schools ``positively emphasise such qualities as
leadership, team-building skills and time management. Employers often say that
the products of independent schools tend to be more articulate and to exhibit
more self-confidence.''
Some parents seek single-sex education for their children. Eileen Davis, deputy
head of St George's School for Girls in Edinburgh, maintains that single-sex
education ``challenges the girls. We can assist them to develop their
self-esteem. Girls mature at different rates to boys and need a lot of
reassurance, especially in the middle teenage years.''
Parents also look for a tangible return on their investment in terms of
academic qualifications. After all, this is the second largest financial
investment most will make, after their house. Since, according to SCIS director
Judith Sischy, most parents ``meet fees out of earned income, with
repercussions on the family's style of life'', their expectations are high.
By and large independent schools meet these expectations. Schools like
Hutchesons' Grammar and the High School of Glasgow, which direct a strong focus
on academic performance and again dominate our tables with the highest
percentages of pupils gaining 3+ and 5+ Highers, are continuing to deliver
admirably.
Yet suspicions of ``league tables'' abound in the independent sector, where no
two parents are looking for exactly the same features in a school. Indeed, the
strength of the sector lies in its diversity - single-sex or co-educational,
day or boarding, taking pupils within various permutations of age ranges
between 2 and 18.
The sector will not go away, because it is providing what its customers demand.
It may only account for 4% of Scotland's pupil population but it would be wrong
to assume that attendance at a fee-paying school is hereditary. Nearly
two-thirds of parents who enrol their children in the sector did not attend an
independent school.
Dr Brian Boyd, associate director of the Quality in Education Centre at
Strathclyde University, feels that independent schools ``do a limited number of
things extremely well. They create an ethos of achievement.'' His fear is that,
in the pursuit of high academic achievement, the less able can be left behind.
He sees it as a sector in which ``the teachers work hard with well-motivated
children'', and points to the emphasis on extra-curricular activities, which
``many schools in the state sector would like to emulate.'' His comment on the
quality of exam results is that ``it would be surprising if they didn't do
well''.

THE artistic director of the Citizens' Theatre in Glasgow has won this year's
Gulliver Award for the Performing Arts in Scotland.
Mr Giles Havergal was presented with his prize and a cheque for #10,000 at a
ceremony at the Signet Library in Edinburgh last night.
``It is a tremendous thrill. As always I am so amazed and convinced they have
sent it to the wrong person,'' he said.
Mr Havergal, who joined the Citizens' in 1969, said he had not yet decided how
to spend the cash which came with the award.
The honour tops off a year of recognition at the highest level for the work of
the Edinburgh-born director.
In January, he was honoured by the city of Glasgow with the St Mungo Prize for
outstanding citizenship, in recognition of his work in establishing the
Citizens' as a centre of artistic excellence.
In August, he joined co-star Sophie Ward in accepting a Herald Angel - for
Festival and Fringe acts which made an outstanding contribution to the arts -
for Philip Prowse's production of Schiller's Don Carlos at the Royal Lyceum. Mr
Havergal co-starred in the production as King Philip of Spain.
He has also used the accolades as an opportunity to turn the public spotlight
on the funding gap the arts in Scotland face following local government
reorganisation next year.
As the Citizens' celebrated its 50th anniversary on its current site in the
Gorbals in October, Mr Havergal, 57, warned it faced closure for between four
and six months each year unless #178,000 could be found to replace the annual
grant from Strathclyde region - which disappears next year.
The Dundee-born composer Gordon McPherson won the Gulliver bursary, which
brings a #5000 cash award. The musician, who has completed commissions for the
Royal Scottish National Orchestra and the Paragon Ensemble of Scotland and was
recently appointed Visiting Composer in Residence at the Royal Scottish Academy
of Music and Drama, was nominated by last year's Gulliver Award winner, Evelyn
Glennie.
The awards were established by Scots-born entrepreneur Mr James Gulliver. A
Scot each year is selected who has made an outstanding contribution to cultural
life in Scotland and abroad.
Mr Gulliver was unable to attend last night's ceremony because of illness.

Christian who
puts his
faith in action
WHEN Bob Holman arrived in Easterhouse 10 years ago, the locals dubbed him The
EastEnder. The eponymous soap opera had just hit the small screen and, to the
untuned ear, the tousle-haired man from Ilford sounded like an extra who had
lost his way.
``We don't like English people here, but it's better than coming from
Edinburgh,'' one local told him bluntly. Happily Bob had some handy
qualifications. He was a university professor and he had a PhD but they don't
count for much in Easterhouse. No, the two qualifications that got him over the
first hurdle were a Glaswegian wife and an unexpected proficiency at table
tennis. The latter had the effect of taking by surprise the bored teenagers who
hung out in an empty shop unit which had been commandeered by a community group.
What had brought this respected academic to Easterhouse was a sort of spiritual
quest. ``I was professor of social administration at Bath University when I
began feeling a bit of a hypocrite. I was writing about social work but not
doing it. I'd written a text book about poverty and was getting the proceeds,
yet I was distanced from people in poverty.''
His Christian faith, too, was nagging him. ``When Christ came to earth he
dwelled with low-income people, not the rich. What were the implications of
that for me?'' The upshot was that he gave up his chair, and moved with his
family to a bleak council estate and started asking people what they wanted.
One woman said: ``A rich bloke of about 40.'' Another screamed from an upstairs
window: ``If you're the bleedin welfare, clear off.'' Most said they wanted
youth clubs. So Bob went about creating a network of clubs which didn't just
entertain kids but also provided a counter to boredom and delinquency and a
source of positive role models.
A decade later the clubs were running themselves and Bob needed a new
challenge. Annette, the Glasgow girl Bob had met in the back row of lectures at
the London School of Economics, and later married, was keen to come home with
their two teenage children, David and Ruth. The council was selling off cheaply
flats in Easterhouse. A #50 deposit secured one.
Today Holman combines working on the coalface of community action with
lecturing at Glasgow University and writing a stream of books. On Wednesday I
caught him applying for Children in Need money for a youth club, delivering a
birthday card to a local youngster and arranging a forthcoming visit to a
swimming pool with local boys, in between answering questions about his
forthcoming book Children and Crime.
It is a potent mixture of keen social observation, personal experience (both
bitter and heartwarming), and a painstaking analysis of work done by others. He
uses this technique ruthlessly to expose some of the slick assumptions made
about juvenile delinquency and debunk tabloid-style mythology about young
thugs. (``People come here for half a day, then go away and write about `the
underclass'. That makes smoke come out of my ears.'')
The book is aimed not so much at students of delinquency and deprivation as
those members of deprived communities fighting to turn them around.
His thesis is that delinquency often has its roots in family malfunctioning,
often in association with poverty and conditions of social deprivation. The
reference to family is no crude theory about the effects of divorce or the
supposed handicap of life in a one-parent family but rather the potential of
the family unit as a vehicle for conveying loving care and firm but fair
discipline.
``There is general agreement that infants do suffer if their mothers fail to
supply not just food and shelter but also the emotional vitamins of love and
affection expressed in cuddling, attention, approval, and stimulation,'' he
says.
And as children grow, parents need to mix other ingredients too: discipline, a
sense of permanence, suitable role models. Families living in poverty are less
able to provide these things. For example, a household on income support cannot
afford regular outings to the ice rink or the cinema. Holman's contention is
that such families need more support rather than Labour's idea of teaching
parenting skills. ``The very act of saying `you're an inadequate parent' will
defeat this strategy. Governments need to make sure parents have the facilities
that enable them to be good parents. If politicians are going to castigate
people in damp overcrowded flats, in areas where there are no youth clubs,
that's going to make the situation worse,'' says Holman.
He is particularly incensed by the Tory right's vendetta against lone
parenthood. ``If it's harder for one parent than two to bring up a child, the
answer is to support them, not go around condemning them. We're not going to
stop one-parent families any more than we're going to stop Princess Di being a
lone parent.''
The real link, he says, is not between crime and poverty or crime and single
parenthood but crime and unemployment. ``If you have no money and you're
hanging around all day, there's a great temptation to get drawn into crime. The
main way to counter delinquency is to have a proper employment policy.''
Holman has some very specific ideas about that. Areas like Easterhouse, he
says, are bursting with human resources and yet many are kicking their heels at
home or struggling in poverty while working as volunteers. The Thatcherite
theory that driving down wages would attract companies into areas like
Easterhouse has been proved false, says Holman. Instead, he says government,
both national and local, should invest in new kinds of jobs that could be
developed in areas like his: running creches and credit unions, for example.
His own experience has been bitter. In Easterhouse with a group of local
people, he set out to repeat the success of the youth clubs in Bath. Fare (The
Family Association of Rogerfield and Easterhouse) runs numerous youth clubs,
outings for children and holidays for local residents, but it operates out of
one tiny office and lurches from one financial crisis to another. Strathclyde
Regional Council holds up Fare as a model but doesn't give it a grant. ``If we
had a building and enough of a budget to employ six youth workers, there's so
much we could do here. We could tackle boredom and drugs. We could reduce
delinquency by getting to kids before they get into trouble.''
Holman's argument isn't just with the Tories. He has a bone to pick with New
Labour too. ``Tony Blair and Jack Straw say community is the answer to
delinquency but none of the parties has a strategy for developing community
groups.''
Old-style socialist? ``My wife says I am Old Labour because I dress like
Michael Foot.'' However, first and foremost Bob Holman is an instance of faith
in action. ``I am a Christian before I am a socialist. I believe all people are
created by God and therefore all people are equally precious to him. Therefore
the resources of the earth are for all people.''

Dynastic dilemmas
of the royal friends
IT is hardly surprising, given that both King Hussein of Jordan and the Queen
ascended their respective thrones in the same year, 1952, that over the decades
a personal friendship has developed between them. Hussein, educated at Harrow
and then Sandhurst, has always been anglophile. The strength of the royal
friendship was demonstrated yesterday when he was guest of honour at a
Buckingham Palace lunch held by the Queen to mark his 60th birthday - he was
born on November 14, 1935.
The royal family plays its part in the diplomatic process of wooing foreign
powers, so the lunch, as well as being a personal affair, was also proof of how
cordial the relationship is at present between Britain and Jordan.
British links with Jordan have always been strong. After the defeat of Turkey
in the First World War, the Amirate of Transjordan was established under
British mandate, a situation which lasted until the end of the Second World
War. It then became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan under King Abdullah, the
former Amir, who was assassinated in 1951. His son, King Talal, a
schizophrenic, ruled for a year before being forced to abdicate on August 11,
1952, in favour of his son, Hussein, whose greatest achievement has been his
survival.
He is currently back in favour with the international community following his
refusal to side with the West in the 1990-91 Gulf war against Saddam Hussein of
Iraq. Although he had no option, given his country's vulnerable geographical
situation, he was cast into outer darkness by the West. The British tabloids
dubbed him ``King Rat'' and Alan Clark, a junior defence minister at the time,
described him as ``that oily little runt''.
His reign has been turbulent, and after his cousin King Faisal of Iraq was
toppled by a coup in 1958 it looked as if Hussein's turn would follow. Britain,
however, came to his rescue with troop reinforcements, the Americans provided
an air lift, and he clung on to his throne.
Over the past 40 years there have been numerous attempted coups, three
Arab-Israeli wars, a revolution in 1957-58, and a civil war in 1970-71
involving the Palestinians. There have also been repeated attempts at
assassination and he once took over the controls of his own plane after the
pilot was killed.
Jordan, surrounded by powerful and jealous countries - Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and
Israel - has to balance its interests, and King Hussein has proved adept at
cutting his cloth. He supported the decision by Egypt and Syria at the 1964
Arab summit in Cairo to divert the headwaters of the Jordan, aware that it
would lead to a war with Israel for which the Arab states were ill prepared.
Their defeat in 1967 meant that the pan-Arab nationlism, which had led to that
disastrous decision being taken, was discredited. It also meant he lost half
his kingdom, including Jerusalem, but he could argue others were to blame.
A classic buffer state, Jordan is hardly a major Arab country. That it has been
influential is due entirely to the King's ability to play the diplomatic game,
and to attract first British and then American support. His guile and charm are
legendary.
He sees himself as the father of all his subjects, whatever their origin -
Jordan is a country of many races: Circassians, Armenians, Palestinians and
Bedu tribesmen - the man whose role is to settle disputes within the Arab
family.
However, his role in the Arab-Israeli peace process has lost him Arab friends,
the Saudis among them, but it has redeemed him in the eyes of the West. Jordan
was the first to follow Egypt's 1979 example when it made peace with Israel
last year, and his presence at Mr Rabin's funeral was evidence of the
relationship between the two men.
His problems include coping with the large number of Palestinians living in
Jordan and what could happen in Iraq. If it disintegrates into a Kurdish north,
a Shia Moslem South, with Saddam's Sunni Moslem Takriti clan in the middle, the
repercussions for Jordan would be serious. He has, therefore, opposed the
continuation of UN sanctions against Iraq because if the Iraqis continue to be
strangled economically a bloodbath could ensue.
His autobiography was aptly entitled Uneasy Lies the Head. His hostess
yesterday, given her own dynastic difficulties, would probably agree it applied
to her too.

<HEADLINE>Major bids to wrest back tax cut mantle</HEADLINE>

THE Prime Minister in a speech to the City last night tried to regain the
taxation initiative from the Labour Party, seven days before the Budget.
Mr Major insisted that the Tories were the true low taxation party and he
heralded significant cuts in state spending to give Chancellor Kenneth Clarke
leeway on tax cuts on Budget day.
Mr Major told the Guildhall banquet: ``Low taxes are the best incentives for
business to invest. That is our aim. The less we take in tax, the more we can
encourage enterprise.''
He coupled this with a plea to British business to support him in his
fence-sitting attitude to a European single currency.
He declared that, unlike Labour, he was determined to reduce the state's share
of Britain's wealth to less than 40%. This, he said, was the only way that
Britain could hope to compete with the United States, Japan, and the
ever-growing business competition from China and the rest of the Far East.
When he goes to the Madrid European Union summit next month, he will be arguing
that the 15-strong member nations of the EU have to regard Asian competition as
a priority.
He said: ``I see three great issues - how to be competitive and put Europe back
to work; how to enlarge the Community; and the implications of a single
currency.''
He boasted that his Maastricht Treaty deal should suit the City as he had
negotiated crucial opt-outs for Britain on a single currency and the Social
Chapter, which, he said, is not simply a set of principles - as Mr Blair told
the CBI last week.
``It is a set of policies which, whatever their supporters claim for them, add
to costs and cost jobs.''
The Prime Minister insisted that his message to the Madrid EU summit next month
would be: ``If others in Europe bind themselves into uncompetitive economic and
social structures, Britain will not join them. We are not going to put our
economic success at risk.''
Mr Major's right-wing Euro sceptics would have wished more from him, but they
might settle for his continuing ambiguity about a European single currency. All
he told the City last night was this: ``Some are passionate about this. Others
have profound doubts. Britain, I am glad to say, has a choice. We can decide
whether to stay out or opt in.''
Mr Major thinks the debate about a single currency in Europe, particularly in
Germany, is swinging his way.
The Prime Minister's object last night was to keep his back benchers calm on
Europe over the next 18 months and to try to persuade the captains of industry
and finance in Britain that an enlargement of the EU and reform of the Common
Agriculture Policy is much more important to sustaining free trade and a single
market than academic debates about a single currency.
Stuart Trotter, Political Correspondent, writes: Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown
yesterday elaborated on his plans to give Labour a potential new image as a tax
cutting party. It was time for a ``new trust on tax'' between Labour and the
people, he said.
He unveiled his much-trailed plan for a new lower income tax band of 10p or 15p
in the pound, promising there would be `` no lies, no deceit, and no
irresponsible commitments'' on tax under a Labour government.
He set out Labour's new tax principles at a lunch in London in aid of the
British Dyslexia Association and promised: ``We will be straight with the
British people about tax. That is why, at the General Election, we will spell
out quite clearly our tax plans so the British people will know what we intend
to do''.
Mr Brown claimed that the new lower starting band would be a powerful incentive
for the unemployed to find work because low-paid employees would not have the
tax cut clawed back through corresponding reductions in benefits.
Lowering the 20p band to 10p would cost #6000m, but Labour plans to phase the
reduction in, depending on economic circumstances.
The plan was criticised by Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell, who said: ``Gordon
on tax is beginning to sound like the theatre of the absurd.''
Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat finance spokesman, said Labour's ``casual
promises'' to cut several taxes while increasing spending ``just don't add up''.

MORE than nine million tons of munitions could have been dumped in a huge
natural trench in the Irish Sea, the Scottish National Party claimed last night.
Ms Roseanna Cunningham, MP, the party's environment spokeswoman, accused the
Government of playing down the extent of dumping in Beaufort's Dyke and
revealed new evidence from the former captain of an Army dumping craft.
Over the past two months, thousands of wartime incendiary bombs have washed
ashore on Scotland's west coast. One theory is that work on a seabed gas
pipeline may have disturbed phosphorous sticks, forcing them to surface.
Ms Cunningham said yesterday: ``With a possible nine million tons of explosives
lying at the mercy of the ocean, it is now more vital than ever that the
Government do all within its power to reveal to the public the true extent of
munitions dumped.''
Mr Charles Buchan, 75, of Peterhead, Grampian, was the youngest captain of Army
dumping craft operating from Cairnryan in the 1940s.
He said: ``We got rid of every kind of explosive, from RAF bombs and naval
shells to rifle ammunition. There were at least 20 boats. I was there from 1943
to 1947. It was very dangerous work because some of the shells were corroded.''
Mr Buchan reckoned that his boat dumped 500 tons of munitions each day, often
working seven days a week, for three years.
On this basis, he estimates he dumped up to half a million tons while he was
there and there were at least 20 more boats involved.
However, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said yesterday that the best estimate
was a million tons of munitions were dumped in Beaufort's Dyke in the Irish Sea.

JURORS trying Rosemary West on 10 counts of murder were sent to a hotel last
night after deliberating over verdicts for more than half the day.
Mr Justice Mantell told them they had worked hard enough for the day. He asked
them not to talk about the case until their return to the jury room at 10.30
this morning.
Before they retired, Mr Mantell had spoken of the alleged lies and the
antipathy Mrs West may have held towards three ``family'' victims.
This, he told the jury, could be evidence of guilt in these cases.
He included Shirley Ann Robinson - said to have been made pregnant by Fred West
and who disappeared when aged 15 in 1978 - in the family category. The others
were her stepdaughter, Charmaine, born in Scotland, and her daughter, Heather.
The Crown alleged Frederick West was in prison at the time Charmaine met her
death and that the girl had been in the sole charge of Rosemary West, the judge
told the jury.
In addition, he said, there was antipathy between Mrs West and Charmaine as
indeed there was between her and Shirley Ann Robinson and Heather. The Crown
had put this forward as possible motives.
It was for the jury to decide whether Mrs West had lied to them in her evidence.
Even if they were sure she had, they would have to consider whether this
implied guilt.
Mr Justice Mantell pointed out a defendant could lie for many reasons.
The judge also referred to the other seven counts of murder they had to
consider.
Normally, he said, a jury would not get to hear about crimes other than those
alleged in the case.
Evidence from Caroline Owens, Miss A, and Anne Marie Davis fell into this
category.
Caroline had given evidence of being picked up by the Wests and she and the two
others had alleged sexual attacks involving restraints, gags, tapes, force, and
sexual abuse.
The Crown, he said, suggested that this was capable of eliminating the
activities which must have preceded the deaths of seven of the victims in the
case.
It also showed, say the Crown, that Rosemary West was one of those involved.
The judge told the jury they would be required to bring in a separate verdict
on each of the 10 counts.
Mrs West was guilty of murder if they were sure she deliberately and unlawfully
participated in the killing of the 10 young women and girls, either by herself
or in connection with someone else, such as Frederick West. This was if the
intention was to kill or cause serious harm.
He said they could return verdicts on the lesser charge of manslaughter.
This was if deaths resulted from actions she was involved in which any sober
and reasonable person might conclude would result in serious physical harm.
The trial continues today.

THE music industry turned out in force last night to honour the grand-daddy of
popular music - Frank Sinatra - at a gala to celebrate his 80th birthday.
Singers and musicians as diverse as Tony Bennett, Ray Charles, Little Richard,
Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and rappers Salt-N-Pepa shared the stage for a
finale of one of Sinatra's biggest songs - ``New York, New York''.
They even persuaded the man himself to come on stage for the final chorus.
Springsteen introduced the singer known as ``Ol' Blue Eyes'' and ``The Chairman
of the Board'' at the start the show, which was raising money for an Aids
project and a centre for abused children.
``The deep blueness of Frank's voice affected me,'' said Springsteen, telling
of hearing Sinatra songs on the juke-box as a child. ``His voice is filled with
bad attitude and sex and a sad knowledge of the world.''
Springsteen kicked off the show with an acoustic version of the song ``Angel
Eyes''.
Bennett, who sang ``I've Got the World on a String'' and ``A Foggy Day in
London Town'', told reporters Sinatra was ``a very misunderstood man''.
``In his youth he acted like he was part of the underworld, but he is
absolutely different, there is so much tenderness in him and he cares for
people.''
Sinatra's actual birthday is December 12. On that day, giant images of the
singer will be projected on buildings in Los Angeles and New York, where the
Empire State Building will be lit up in blue in his honour.
The gala, ``Sinatra: 80 Years My Way'', is to be televised around the world.
Interspersed with the live performances, Sinatra and his wife, Barbara, heard
videotaped tributes from such musicians as U2's Bono and operatic tenor Luciano
Pavarotti.
Dylan performed his early, introspective ``Restless Farewell'' while Little
Richard sang a rocking version of ``That Old Black Magic''.
Even the famed can-can dancers from the Moulin Rouge in Paris kicked up their
heels for the birthday bash, which included Hollywood stars such as Arnold
Schwarzenegger and Gregory Peck.-Reuter.

THE US federal government jerked back to life this morning, after a six-day
shut-down. President and Congress reached agreement last night on the terms of
a temporary resumption, and will now return to the serious debate on balancing
the budget.
President Clinton conceded the key Republican demand that he accept a goal of
balancing the budget by 2002, and Congress allowed him to insert a great number
of qualifiers to the promise. The two sides agreed to compromise on whose set
of numbers to use.
When the agreement was reached, both Houses rushed through a measure financing
the government for 24 hours. This allowed the calls to go out to 700,000 or
more civil servants who had been laid off since last Monday.
A Bill, known as a continuing resolution, to continue operations until December
15 was presented to Congress this afternoon. Washington assumed that it would
pass, but conservative Republicans in the House, notably the 74 freshmen who
had sworn they would accept nothing short of a complete capitulation by the
president, needed persuading.
The speaker, Newt Gingrich, spent the day doing that. His chief tactic was to
claim victory and he appeared on television repeatedly doing so.
Mr Clinton was equally adamant that he had won the confrontation. The sides
could at least agree that the substantive talks on the budget, which will begin
next Monday after the Thanksgiving break, will be exceedingly difficult, and
that part of the government may shut down again in the middle of next month.
The qualifications Mr Clinton insisted on putting into yesterday's agreement
are that the balanced budget ``must protect future generations, ensure Medicare
solvency, reform welfare, and provide adequate funding for Medicaid, education,
agriculture, national defence, veterans, and the environment. Further, the
balanced budget should adopt tax policies to help working families and
stimulate future economic growth.''
That, obviously, gives the president all the leeway he needs.
It commits him to nothing, since there is no accepted definition of any of the
clauses.
As for the numbers to be used, Congress had been insisting that the projections
for 2002 be those produced by the Congressional Budget Office. The president
wanted to use the figures of the Office of Management and the Budget.
The two sets of numbers vary in their estimates of the country's economic
prospects in the next seven years: the more pessimistic CBO figures would mean
that government spending would have to be cut more severely than the cuts
needed to meet the OMB figures.
The two sides have agreed, in effect, to merge the two sets of assumptions
(though Mr Gingrich swore yesterday that he would never do such a thing). Since
guessing a whole host of economic variables over seven years is a wildly
inexact science, the debate on the numbers was always a fiction. What mattered
was that the Republicans wanted deeper cuts than the president. They have
agreed to compromise.
It was high time. The closure was very unpopular, and public opinion was
blaming the Republicans. However, the president could not be sure that the
blame might not suddenly shift in his direction, so he was glad to settle.
Now the House will pass the detailed seven-year budget, the president will veto
it because it cuts programmes too sharply and because he disagrees with the
scale of tax cuts, and then the two sides will start arguing again.
Wall Street reacted to the settlement by pushing the Dow Jones average above a
record 5000 for the first time, a 1200-point rise this year.

<HEADLINE>Motivation is the name of the game for Aitken Aberdeen manager focused on cup final</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975274197</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
ABERDEEN manager Roy Aitken yesterday predicted that his side will win the
Coca-Cola Cup if he can psyche his players up for the challenge.
Aitken refused to discuss the defeat by Raith Rovers which did so much to
undermine confidence going into Sunday's showpiece against Dundee at Hampden.
He said: ``That's history and the last thing on my mind. I don't look back. All
that concerns me is preparing my players physically and mentally for one thing
- to win the cup.
``It is a big week for the club and all my thoughts are focused on achieving
this.
``It is my job to lift and motivate them to ensure they are ready. I'll do this
by using my experience by getting into their heads and making certain they are
fit.
``I have spoken to the players and laid out the plans for the week. They have
been asked to take responsibility for themselves and do what is required in
their preparations.
``If they perform to the capabilities they have already shown in this
competition we will win the cup.
``Form will go out the window but they have the quality to handle it. That is
the challenge ahead of them.
``Jim Duffy has his team playing well. Dundee are in this final on merit and we
will give every respect.
``It is there to be won by both teams. But if we play to our strengths and
maintain the standards we've set we will come out on top.''
Despite Aitken's reluctance to dwell on the setback at Kirkcaldy, Aberdeen
could pay the price as they bid to end a five-year wait for a trophy.
Aitken added: ``I hope to have a full squad available. I will assess the
players constantly throughout the week to see who is ready.
``My final selection will be as honest as it can be to win the cup. Obviously,
some players will be disappointed.
``The fact that our ticket allocation is a sell-out shows how our fans feel. It
is a great week for everyone connected with the club and we will enjoy it.''
Eoin Jess and Theo Snelders, missing through injury at Stark's Park, will
restart training tomorrow.
Meanwhile, Dundee United's Dave Bowman will make his comeback tonight at
Tannadice - more than two months after fracturing his cheekbone.
The former Scotland midfield player will face Brechin City in a Reserve League
East fixture, wearing a mask to protect the injury that has kept him out so
long. Bowman was hurt in the league game against St Mirren on September 9 and
has been one of many United players hit by serious injury as they have
struggled to make an impact on the first division title race.
Also in the United line-up will be another influential midfield player making
his way back from a long-term absence.
Scotland under-21 internationalist David Hannah hopes to complete his first 90
minutes of action since he damaged his groin in August.
United manager Billy Kirkwood said: ``It is a great encouragement that those
two players are coming closer to being available for the first team.
``This will be Hannah's third outing with the reserves and Bowman has been able
to maintain most of his general fitness by being fully involved in our training
recently.''
But Kirkwood made it clear he won't be waiting around until these two are fully
fit before taking action aimed at consolidating their bid for a return to the
premier division.
The 3-2 defeat by neighbours Dundee was their fourth in the league this season
and Kirkwood said: ``I will be thinking about changes. I have a big pool of
players at my disposal and I intend to make use of that.
``The biggest disappointment has been the way individual mistakes have been
costing us games on a regular basis.
``This is a tough league but, in a way, we have been creating a lot of our own
problems.''
It seems certain that Kirkwood will concentrate those changes in defence in an
effort to stop conceding the type of goals that they lost in the Tayside derby.
But there is also every chance that striker Craig Brewster has earned a recall
for the game with Airdrie on Saturday after his performance as a substitute
against Dundee.

BRIGHTON will name their new manager later this week following the resignation
of Liam Brady yesterday after 23 months in charge.
Brady met major shareholder Bill Archer on Sunday, the day after the second
division strugglers lost their sixth successive league match, and announced his
departure to shocked players at training.
The former Celtic manager left in the wake of Brighton's #6m debts and doubts
about a ground to replace the Goldstone, which has been sold for development.
Chief executive David Bellotti said: ``It is all very sad. We are going to
announce his successor in two or three days. We are treating it very
urgently.'' Because of the club's debts, Brady was able to buy only one player
- a modest #15,000 outlay on Exeter winger Stuart Storer.
Brady, who ended three difficult years as Celtic manager in 1993, was quick to
blame the money worries for his team's decline to twenty-third in the table.
``After speaking to Bill Archer it was mutually agreed I should stand down as
manager,'' he said.
``If a manager and a team are to achieve results with very limited resources
then the club must have a stable and harmonious environment. This has not been
possible this season for reasons beyond my control.''
q RAY Harford felt the icy blast of the Russian winter but maintained his
under-fire Blackburn side could silence their Champions' League knockers
tomorrow night.
Harford has bridled at the accusations of tactical naivety levelled against his
side as their European dreams faded to nothing in the space of two months.
A record of three defeats and one draw can hardly have raised confidence in the
build-up to take on runaway group leaders Spartak Moscow.
But after eventually landing with his team in the Russian capital - two hours
late after a delay at Blackpool - to find temperatures plummeting well below
zero, Harford remained convinced that the picture has been painted blacker than
it really is.
``I got slaughtered after the first game against Spartak with people telling me
it wasn't the way to play in Europe,'' said Harford.
``Despite what's been said it wasn't all bad. as far as I'm concerned we've
only had one bad performance in Europe and that was in Rosenborg.''
q ASTON Villa, without a success at The Dell for 13 years, put that record
right last night when Tommy Johnson, booked for a foul just minutes earlier,
scored for the Birmingham side after 30 minutes in their 1-0 win against
Southampton.
Dwight Yorke and Ian Taylor combined to create the gap, and Johnson had plenty
of time to fire a low shot past Southampton keeper Dave Beasant.
Matt Le Tissier had a quiet game but he cut open the Villa defence giving
Gordon Watson a scoring chance, but keeper Mark Bosnich saved under the bar.
This success puts Villa to within two points of second-placed Manchester United
in the Premiership.

FOOTBALL'S six regional confederation heads yesterday endorsed a series of
reforms proposed by UEFA which reduced the powers of FIFA chief Joao Havelange
and forced the world's governing body to share their World Cup revenue more
evenly.
Havelange met the heads of Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania, North and Central
America at FIFA's headquarters in Zurich, and agreed they should have greater
control of the sport in their own regions plus a bigger say in choosing FIFA's
powerful standing committees.
But two of the most important proposals by European governing body UEFA - for
the World Cup finals to be rotated among the confederations and for reform of
FIFA's executive committee - were shelved.
``What more can you ask for? I'm very happy,'' said UEFA president Lennart
Johansson, who brought a long-running power struggle into the open by pushing
the reform plans. ``We are happy with the result, but we do not look at
ourselves as winners. There are no winners or losers - every decision we took
was unanimous.''
q ANCONA trainer Massimo Cacciatori underwent surgery on his broken jaw
yesterday following the brawl which marred their Anglo-Italian Cup clash with
Birmingham.
Cacciatori was branded a ``disgrace'' by Birmingham manager Barry Fry, who
accused him of attacking three players as a brawl broke out towards the end of
the match.
But Cacciatori, who was admitted to hospital immediately after last Wednesday's
flashpoint and required surgery for hairline fractures, alleges he was set upon
by Birmingham players and officials after the game.
The Serie B club, who lost the game 2-1, claim Cacciatori is considering legal
action once he recovers while both the English and Italian leagues have
launched inquiries into the brawl.

<TEXT>
CELTIC midfielder Peter Grant is facing a three-match suspension which will
keep him out of first team action for much of December. He was one of nine
players booked by Motherwell referee Hugh Dallas in Sunday's Old Firm match.
Now Grant will be ruled out for games against Hibernian (away) on December 9,
Falkirk (home) on December 16, and Raith (away) on Boxing Day.
Grant's ban follows a controversial ordering off at Hearts on September 23 when
TV evidence suggested he was innocent in an incident with John Robertson. He
was awarded penalty points and the Old Firm caution took him over the 16-point
threshold.
Rangers midfielder Paul Gascoigne collected his sixth domestic booking in 13
appearances in Scottish football. He also has exceeded the points threshold and
will serve a one-match suspension when Rangers meet Partick Thistle at Ibrox on
December 9.
Hibernian's Northern Ireland internationalist, Michael O'Neill, faces a
four-match suspension after his sending-off in the Edinburgh derby at
Tynecastle. O'Neill, who had 12 points against him beforehand, automatically
misses tomorrow's game against Partick.
He will be available for Saturday's match against Rangers and the following
game with Motherwell, but will miss further matches against Celtic, Raith and
Partick next month.

AFTER a dramatic second day in the Network Q RAC Rally, the race for the World
Rally Championship, featuring Subaru team-mates Carlos Sainz and Colin McRae,
is still far from decided.
The Scot is the faster driver but twice damaged his car yesterday, while
Spaniard Sainz survived an overheating engine to take a 39-second lead as the
cars returned to Chester.
``I'm driving at the absolute maximum, but Colin is            still taking
time out of me,'' said Sainz.
Subaru hold first, second, and fourth places in the rally, more than enough to
beat   Andrew Cowan's Mitsubishi team to the manufacturers' world championship.
Overnight leader Tommi Makinen struck a log in Hamsterley Forest yesterday,
breaking a driveshaft. Later the Finn was found to have broken the gearbox of
his Mitsubishi so was eliminated.
McRae set fastest time - by 28 seconds - and regained the lead. Next came the
36-mile stage in Pundershaw Forest, where a rock caught McRae and Sweden's
Kenneth Eriksson. Both suffered punctures but they continued until their
puncture-proof tyres failed and both had to stop and change wheels, each losing
almost two minutes.
Although his Subaru Impreza lost all its water in the stage, Sainz set the
fastest time and moved into a 74-second lead over McRae.
Alister McRae, Colin's younger brother, overturned his car but continued in
sixth place, while Malcolm Wilson rolled and damaged his Escort too badly to
continue. Bruno Thiry lost time when leaking brake fluid caught fire forcing
him to drive 15 miles with no brakes.
Richard Burns, navigated by Perthshire's Robert Reid in the third Impreza,
climbed from eighth to fourth place. ``We were taking no risks and it was the
right tactic. Look what happened to the          others,'' said Burns.
Three stages later Colin McRae hit another rock, damaging his front suspension
and puncturing a tyre. He and co-driver Derek Ringer effected temporary
roadside repairs, using a log to lever the damaged front suspension back into
place, and then drove 45 miles to their service crew.
Robbie Head, in a Renault Clio Maxi, had closed to within four seconds of the
two-    litre category leader, Jarmo Kytolehto, only to dive into a ditch and
lose 90 seconds. His run of misfortune continued when he rolled the car in
stage 11.
Today he restarts in twenty-fourth place overall, eight minutes behind the new
category leader, Gwyndaf Evans, driving a Ford Escort.
Kelso's Dom Buckley led the category for showroom cars in a Mitsubishi until
his steering failed. He reached Chester last night in fifty-ninth place overall
but out of contention for the Group N category. The new leader is Rui Madeira,
who also is driving a Mitsubishi. Interim positions after 14 stages:
1, C Sainz/L Moya, Subaru, 2hr 23min.37sec; 2, C McRae/D Ringer, Subaru,
2-24.16; 3, K Eriksson/S Parmander, Mitsubishi, 2-25.36; 4, R Burns/R Reid,
Subaru, 2-26.44; 5, B Thiry/S Prevot, Ford Escort,      2-26.49; 6, A McRae/C
Wood, Ford Escort, 2-28.05.

WALTER Smith may have been tempted to come on heavily with the bombast
yesterday after the spirited manner in which Rangers twice recovered from the
loss of goals against Celtic in Sunday's pulsating Old Firm match, but while
encouraged by his side's desire and play, the manager lapsed into much more
subdued mode. He knows the premier-division and Champions' League are worlds
apart.
Each demands skills and     disciplines and what is necessarily potent in the
Scottish context may be weak or insipid on foreign fields, but not all of them
if Dumitro Dumitriu, the manager of Steaua Bucharest, can be believed.
Without the fanfare and frantic excitement which heralded Juventus' recent
arrival in Glasgow, Dumitriu shepherded his players into Glasgow yesterday, and
with a degree of pessimism which makes him a kindred spirit of Jim McLean, he
said: ``Our Champions' League hopes are over.''
He was speaking on behalf of both teams even though Rangers and their Romanian
opponents each still have a chance of qualifying from Group C in second place
behind Juventus. However, Dumitriu seemed at pains to make it clear he has
already accepted his team and Rangers will not progress to the quarter-finals.
``I believe we (Steaua and Rangers) were a little frightened of Juventus and
Dortmund,'' he said. ``We may have given them too much respect, which was a
mistake.''
Smith, while aware of the situation - Juventus top the section with maximum
points from four matches, Borussia Dortmund have five points, Steaua four, and
Rangers one - was unwilling to talk about the slender possibility of
qualifying. He saw no point in looking beyond tomorrow night's match.
``I think that after the two games against Juventus you don't look at the
possibilities. You just want to do well in the next match,'' he said. ``As far
as qualification is concerned you couldn't begin to look at that until after
the game against Steaua.''
Smith and Rangers' supporters are not the only people mystified by the players'
inability to present more of a challenge in the Champions' League, a failure
which also has puzzled Dumitriu. ``Rangers spent a lot of money in the summer
and have a lot of good players, especially Paul Gascoigne and Brian Laudrup,''
he said.
``Laudrup is their main      player and we are expecting a hard game at Ibrox,
where we lost 4-0 in a summer competition. But that was not a true reflection
of the game and this one, I believe, will be different.''
Smith hopes his players will take heart from the game against Celtic but
anxious about the effects two demanding matches in rapid succession might have
on Laudrup and David Robertson. Both only returned to active duty    after
spells on the sidelines     because of injuries, and while they were moving
freely enough yesterday the manager pointed out: ``It is usually a game or so
afterwards when players who have been out might feel something, but at the
moment Ian Ferguson is our only concern after the
He felt stiffness in a hamstring, but should be all right for the game. And the
same comment applies to Richard Gough, who suffered facial damage on Sunday.
The manager will have to give serious thought to his starting line-up.
Ally McCoist scored and might be worth a start, while Ian Durrant is always a
player worth sending into the European arena.
Rangers must beat Steaua if they are to make the trip to Dortmund next month
with more than a desire to salvage some damaged pride provided, of course, the
Germans don't beat Juventus tomorrow night. Dumitriu, however, remains
pessimistic: ``My side and Rangers need miracles if either is to qualify,'' he
said.
``We may have played the last four games without producing our best, but I
don't think either team can win both their last two games. It is regrettable.''
Damian Militru, who was sent off in Bucharest along with Alan McLaren, said
there would be no vendetta at Ibrox: ``It was frustrating having to sit and
watch my team's last three matches because players like to play in big
matches.''

SCOTTISH football is about to break with cherished tradition and allow TV
evidence to be used in disciplinary matters. That is the recommendation of the
relevant committee which met yesterday and unanimously agreed to the move
inspired by the majority of premier-division chairmen who put forward their
views via the League Management Committee.
Drew Herbertson, secretary of the disciplinary committee, said that the
recommendation would be put before the executive committee next week.
Typically, of course, the decision to accept the move was couched in cautious
language . . . such as ``in certain circumstances'' and ``at the sole
discretion of the committee''. . . but it looks certain that the full council
will approve the proposal after it is moved on by the executive.
If it seems remarkable that a momentous change such as this is delivered in
such a short time span, it shows that the clubs appear unaware that they are
actually in charge of their own destiny.
It was only after a poll conducted in The Herald last week that the premier
chairmen elected to push for the alteration, yet it could be part of the
disciplinary system inside a couple of weeks.
Most people inside football will welcome the decision, if only because denying
the existence of television proof, which everybody bar the committee studies
(at least that is the official position) is adopting a Victorian stance.
The Herald poll discovered that the club chairmen, with only one definite
exception, Falkirk's George Fulston, were in favour of the change, with
Kilmarnock's Bob Fleeting, a member of the disciplinary committee, a leading
proponent. Raith Rovers were not contactable and Rangers preferred not to
comment as they were heavily involved in the previous weekend's controversy.
Although TV evidence has never been sanctioned by the SFA, incidents such as
the one involving Duncan Ferguson, which was clearly shown on the screen, are
invariably examined by their committee on the report of the referee or, failing
that, the referee supervisor.
However, Rangers are believed to be challenging the right of the supervisor's
evidence to be used in this fashion, with specific regard to the SFA inquiry
into violent incidents when three Ibrox players, Paul Gascoigne, John Brown,
and Alan McLaren, and one from Aberdeen, Billy Dodds, were caught on camera.
The two clubs, as is normal practice, were asked to give their comments to the
committee for yesterday's meeting, but the response from Ibrox is understood to
have indicated their view that the role of the supervisor is not written in the
rule book and thus is incompetent.
After the meeting, Herbertson said that the committee would be replying to
Rangers' letter but, although the Ibrox club is entitled to challenge the
legality of the supervisor's interventions, the SFA are free under their own
rules to discipline any player of any club as they see fit. Rangers, as members
of the Association, agree to the rules and it doesn't seem likely that they
will be able to get very far with this argument.
The relevant section states that the disciplinary committee ``retains
discretion to deal with exceptional cases of players' misconduct.''
However, suggestions that the club might be banned for failing to respond in
the manner requested look well off target. The committee merely ask clubs to
make their comments on specific incidents involving their players but, if they
don't like the replies, that hardly makes a case for suspension.
If Rangers refuse to put up a defence of any sort, insisting that the
``prosecution'' case is flawed, the SFA almost certainly will go ahead with the
discipline procedure anyway. Only if Rangers prevented their players from
appearing or refused to accept any adjudication would there be a serious
collision.
Nothing will be known on that front until Rangers reply to the SFA letter, but
in the current circumstances it does not look like a good time to have a
confrontation between the leading club in the country and the ruling body.
Football is anxious to demonstrate to outsiders, particularly
procurators-fiscal, that it can handle its own affairs and such a collision
would not be helpful in that context.
Although Herbertson would say only that the clubs were being informed of the
SFA deliberations, it is certain that the quartet will be asked to make
personal appearances at the next disciplinary committee.
It was after the report by referee supervisor Don McVicar that the inquiry into
the Ibrox events was instigated, athough referee John Rowbotham did not send
off any of the players concerned.
There were other players from other clubs whose behaviour was being
investigated, too, yesterday, Alan Lawrence, of Hearts, was one, along with
Sean Sweeney, of Airdie, and Dumbarton's Ian MacFarlane. They also escaped
severe punishment for off-the-ball offences.

IT would be in keeping with the incongruities of this season to date if Rangers
were to administer a proper beating to Steaua Bucharest at Ibrox tomorrow night
in the Champions' League.
There have been so many Scottish disappointments at European level, yet
pleasant surprises at international level, that it is Sod's Law that the
European trend will now be reversed.
More important than satisfying the whims of the gods, however, is that a
victory for Rangers is desperately needed to restore a little of the prestige
of the premier division in the eyes of the Continent.
That is why every fan in Scotland, (yes, even those with Parkhead leanings)
should set aside the traditions of a century and lend a little support to the
Ibrox team.
The reason is simple. As Scotland's representatives in this league, Rangers
carry the prestige and the reputation of this country into every European game,
even more so now as they are the only club left still tackling foreign
opposition.
So far, they have been a serious disappointment in their attempts to compete at
the highest level, having been trounced twice by Juventus, beaten by Steaua,
and managing only a draw a home against Borussia Dortmund.
They have to win if they are to have any chance of further progress but that is
only one reason they deserve backing from beyond their own sympathisers.
More important is the fact that the better they do the better chance there is
that they and their successors as champions, whenever and whoever, will retain
a place in the tournament at all.
UEFA's intricate points system which rates countries on their teams'
performances in Europe could eventually relegate the champions of this country
to alternative status as one of the teams thrown into the UEFA Cup, rather than
the Champions' League, with all the consequent loss of finance, not to mention
prestige, that would mean.
There has been no major assistance to Rangers from our other clubs in Europe
this season as Celtic, Motherwell, and Raith Rovers all went out at an early
stage.
The Scottish standing did not benefit much from their efforts nor of anybody
else in recent times.
It is also the case that Scotland's qualification for the finals of the
European Championships next summer in England has impressed and puzzled foreign
observers who are at a loss to understand why our top club cannot make any kind
of impression in the Champions' League, yet the national side, which does not
have the benefit of foreign influence on the field, has put up such a fine show
in their qualifying group.
The superb consistency of the under-21 side in their own European
Championships, in which they have won seven successive matches, is also being
noticed abroad and again mystifies distant watchers who hear of the poverty of
the current game in Scotland.
The displays of the international teams have begun to reverse the deflated
reputation of footballers in this country and, if Rangers can recoup some of
their lost prestige tomorrow, all of Scotland's football lovers will be able to
come out from behind the wagons. That would be a pleasant change.
If Scottish football needs some magic from one of those ``foreign'' lads, like
Brian Laudrup or Paul Gascoigne, we will accept it willingly.
It is much too important to worry about the niceties.
Talking of the Champions' League game, does it not seem a bit of daft planning
to stage the postponed Hibs-Partick Thistle game in almost direct opposition to
the Rangers-Steaua game.
The match that never got started because the floodlights at Easter Road failed
could surely have been rescheduled on a more profitable evening.
However, I understand that Hibs were ordered to play this midweek, even
although they were sandwiched between a Sunday derby and meeting Rangers on
Saturday but it seems to me that some kind of compromise could have been
reached between the club and the league in the exceptional circumstances.

FEWER than 3% of companies and institutions responded to a Scottish survey on
employers' attitudes to alcohol-related problems in the workplace, it emerged
yesterday.
Only 82 of 3000 companies and institutions which were sent questionnaires
responded to the survey, which was commissioned by the Scottish Council on
Alcohol.
It was designed to help gauge the level of employer awareness to alcohol misuse
at work and the provision of policies to help alleviate absenteeism and
impaired performance.
Yesterday, Mr Douglas Allsop, SCA executive director, admitted the response
indicated ``a great deal of apathy'' among employers to the problem, which
accounts for an estimated 1.4m lost working days in Scotland each year.
He warned that Health and Safety regulations now imposed an obligation on
employers to address the misuse.
He forecast that similar EU legislation could compel employers to introduce
policies to deal with alcohol-related problems.
Mr Allsop said: ``The perception among employers seems to be that if you ignore
the problem it will largely go away. But this is not the case, it just gets
worse.''
Mr Allsop made his comments in Glasgow where 11 companies, who collectively
employ more than 150,000 workers, received Working Concern Employers' Awards
from the SCA in recognition of their efforts in adopting policies to address
the problems associated with alcohol at work.
The three principal award winners were Strathclyde region; Apex Scotland, an
employment charity for offenders and ex-offenders; and United Distillers, which
produces and packages Scotch whisky.
The awards scheme, in its second year, is sponsored by the Portman Group which
promotes sensible drinking on behalf of the UK's major alcoholic drinks
companies.
Of the 82 companies questioned in the survey, issued between April and July,
78% were in favour of banning alcohol consumption at work or during working
hours; 56% supported banning staff who had been drinking from the premises; and
17% believed there should be compulsory checks on staff to see if they had an
alcohol problem.
The survey also showed that 65% of the companies were aware of staff who had
been absent because of their drinking.

LABOUR councillors in the new Falkirk unitary council have backed down from
their decision to deny SNP representation on the Forth Valley joint police and
fire boards.
The original decision to appoint five Labour councillors and one Independent to
the boards, which are shared with Stirling and Clackmannan, resulted in the SNP
raising a complaint with Mr George Kynoch, Scottish Local Government Minister.
The SNP had also called on Labour's Shadow Secretary George Robertson to put
his house in order.
However, having considered guidance from the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities on the political balance to be achieved in such appointments, the
Labour administration has changed its view.
Two Labour appointees have resigned and the two vacancies will be filled from
the SNP group.
Councillor David Alexander of the SNP said he was delighted by the
``climbdown''.

A GLASGOW judge yesterday jailed a lawyer for seven years, saying his crimes
had been of a ``gigantic scale''.
Giles Davies, 42, who had admitted embezzling #2.5m from the clients' account
of his firm in Newton Stewart, Wigtownshire, looked dazed as he was sentenced.
Temporary Judge Robin McEwan QC, told the High Court in Glasgow that it was a
sad day when the courts had to sentence a member of their own profession.
However, he said Davies had ``besmirched'' and damaged the good name of
solicitors all over Scotland who had to discharge their professional duties
with complete public trust.
He added: ``Public confidence demands that solicitors can be trusted. The
operation of a client's account is sacrosanct.''
Judge McEwan said Davies' breach of trust was ``gross, repeated, and
continuing'' and that the large sums of money lost may never be recovered.
Although the crime spanned a four-year period Judge McEwan said the major part
of the crime was committed over nine months.
He said Davies was in poor health and had prevented a long and expensive trial
by pleading guilty but that a severe jail sentence would have to be imposed
without ``fear or favour''.
He also questioned the role of Davies' partners in the legal firm, who were
unaware of the ongoing embezzlement.
Proper checks on the firm's books and bank accounts should have alerted them to
the crime, he added.
As a senior partner, Davies, of Barhill, Ayrshire, drove the firm of McCormick
and Nicholson into bankruptcy.
He claimed he was ``conned'' into investing clients' money in an international
fraud which promised a 500% profit.
Judge McEwan said 10 people benefited from the fraud, and that one man's
tailor's bill and mortgage arrears were paid by Davies.
He said: ``The firm and its partners were ruined and the trust of respectable
people in Wigtownshire and Galloway was betrayed.''
Davies, a father of three, was himself tricked when he used #175,000 of
clients' money.
He used it as a non-returnable deposit on behalf of the conman who claimed he
wanted to buy Borrodale Castle in Argyll.
He lost the deposit and began investing in the fraud.
His schoolteacher wife Moira, who still lives in the couple's house in
Barrhill, was not in court during the three-day hearing.
The Law Society of Scotland has used its insurance guarantee scheme to repay
Davies' victims.
The conman who lured Davies into the scheme and who cannot be named for legal
reasons, is expected to be charged and brought to court in the near future, the
advocate depute Alan Turnbull said.
While on the run for nine days after the embezzlement was discovered, Davies
wrote to his partners apologising and saying he had been ``conned'' into the
fraud.
Davies is expected to be sent to Penninghame Open Prison, Wigtown, after he
serves part of his sentence.
However, an angry farmer whose money was used by Davies in the fraud said:
``They had better not send him out on day-release to work locally, or anything
could happen to him.
``His name is a dirty word down here and although we have all had our money
back, it caused us no end of trouble and worry.''
Davies' former partners had their practising certificates suspended temporarily
by the Law Society and are now working for other firms.
They lost their jobs and their homes and one said: ``It took me three years to
begin to get over what happened.
``We trusted Davies to run the cash accounts and clients' accounts and deal
with the banks. He was the senior partner after all.''
The embezzlement was uncovered when a bank manager became suspicious.

TWO Scots Guards were convicted of murdering a Belfast teenager after a witness
lied, three Appeal Court judges were told yesterday.
The claim was made on the opening day of an appeal by James Fisher, 28, from
Ayrshire, and Mark Wright, 22, from Arbroath. They were convicted at Belfast
Crown Court last February of murdering 18-year-old Mr Peter McBride and
sentenced to life imprisonment.
The soldiers admitted opening fire on Mr McBride but denied murder. They
claimed they thought he was carrying a bomb.  Mr Peter Smith QC, for Fisher,
questioned whether Mr McBride was searched before he ran off. He said witnesses
said he had been searched but the evidence of one, Mr John McMullan, could not
be relied upon.
He had said he heard the soldiers shouting at Mr McBride to halt. He later said
he heard a soldier shout: ``Shoot the bastard.''
Mr Smith said that evidence showed the witness was prepared to lie to make
things worse for the soldiers.
The hearing is expected to last a week.

LABOUR MP Tom Clarke yesterday told the Government inquiry into employment
practices at Monklands District Council that he had never received any
complaints from constituents about alleged favouritism.
His evidence was in sharp contrast with that of Labour colleague Helen Liddell,
now representing the neighbouring seat formerly held by the late Labour leader
John Smith, who last week told the inquiry that she got complaints almost daily
from constituents.
Mr Clarke, MP for Monklands West and a former Shadow Scottish Secretary, also
told the inquiry that he and Mr Smith, who represented Monklands East, had
maintained a silence during a local newspaper campaign about the allegations
because they did not wish to see a revival of religious discrimination which
had dogged the area many years earlier.
Mr Clarke, a former provost of the council whose constituency includes
Coatbridge where the council's HQ is based, was asked by the inquiry chairman,
Mr William Nimmo Smith QC, if he had received complaints from constituents
about alleged favouritism by councillors in allocating jobs.
Mr Clarke said: ``In fact, I don't recollect one single letter, or one single
complaint making these allegations.''
However, he said he had received complaints from constituents who were appalled
at the way the Monklands area was being represented in the press.
He said he had received representation from a Church of Scotland minister
unhappy at the contents of the Black report. This report was ordered by the
council and written by Professor Robert Black QC. It led to the Scottish Office
setting up the present inquiry.
Mr Clarke said the clergyman got a standing ovation for his pulpit address
attacking the way the area was being misrepresented.
Asked by Mr Nimmo Smith if he had ever asked chief executive Maurice Hart or
anyone else on the council if there was any truth in allegations surrounding
Monklands, Mr Clarke replied: ``No. It would have been quite improper had I
done so. Members of this council are not responsible to MPs. The responsibility
for their conduct is ultimately with the Secretary of State for Scotland.
``That's why John Smith and I again and again asked the (then) Secretary, Ian
Lang, for such a public inquiry on this. But he refused to do so, keeping the
ball rolling for political reasons for a very long time.''
Mr Clarke told the inquiry that his brother, Anthony, was a Monklands
councillor. He accepted that three nieces and a nephew, all Clarkes, worked on
the council.
He also said he was a supporter of the Staffing Rota Committee which, the
inquiry heard earlier, comprised six councillors who assessed applicants for
council jobs, from the lowest to the highest position. That committee was
abolished after a Scottish Labour Party inquiry into council conduct.
Mr Clarke said the council had been correct to accept the advice of personnel
consultants, Ashdown Milan, on the issue.
Anyone with a knowledge of the area's history who wanted the communities to
work together, he said, would have appreciated the committee's earlier
existence as an aid to stamping out religious discrimination.
That was why he and Mr Smith had maintained ``a perfect silence'' during a
local paper campaign which alleged nepotism and corrupt practices on the
council. Neither he nor Mr Smith had wanted to intervene, for fear of reviving
the subject of religious discrimination which they had hoped was a thing of the
past.
Mr Clarke, now a Labour spokesman on disabled people's rights, said he was
convinced both the local paper and the national press carried the Monklands
allegations simply because the late Labour leader was a local MP and Mr Clarke
was Shadow Scottish Secretary.
He added that if there had been any suggestion of Labour Party members gaining
jobs or promotion for reasons other than merit, he would have ``kicked up
hell''.
The inquiry continues.

A COUNCIL has unveiled plans for a #2.25m Pictish visitor centre.
Angus district's new tourist attraction, proposed for the grounds of Brechin
Castle on Dalhousie estates, will house archeological remains and a range of
Pictish displays.
The centre is expected to attract 109,000 visitors each year, making it the
second largest tourist attraction in Angus behind Glamis Castle.
Angus has nearly 100 carved symbol stones dating from the sixth to the eleventh
century. The proposed centre is expected to increase interest in Pictish sites
in the area.
The area's director of tourism, Mr Philip Bowman, said: ``This development
would be of considerable benefit to the Angus economy.
``Brechin would be a very fitting site for this exciting new development: the
area is steeped in Pictish history.''
A feasibility study was carried out by the Ash Consulting Group and PLB Design
Ltd.
The self-styled Pictish leader, Robbie the Pict, criticised the plans last
night.
``We haven't been consulted about any of this.......I'm having nothing to do
with it,'' he said.

POLICE and trading standards officers raided shops in Glasgow and Clydebank
yesterday to launch what has been described as a test case for selling cannabis
paraphernalia.
It is understood that Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth believes the Misuse of
Drugs Act 1971 may allow prosecution of those who sell such items as cannabis
seeds and pipes.
Officials say that, at present, the selling of such items is a grey area. The
Act proscribes those who knowingly supply items to be used in the manufacture
or abuse of drugs, but pipes, cannabis seeds, and magazines about the drug are
openly sold in shops across Scotland. The issue rests on whether or not the
shopkeeper can know what someone will use the items for.
Strathclyde Police said four men, all in their thirties, were reported to the
procurator-fiscal following yesterday's raids on two separate shops.
Strathclyde Regional Council launched a campaign earlier this year to dissuade
the sale of cannabis paraphernalia.
The council's Cut the Grass initiative was aimed at dissuading shops from
selling, among other things, pipes, seeds, scales, and books on cultivation.
At the time, council convener Bill Perry said trading in such items was
anti-social and irresponsible and put profit before the good of the community.
He said that if traders did not respond to calls for such business to cease
``then we must empower our consumer and trading standards officers and police
to seize such goods and prosecute in the interest of the public''.
In a statement issued yesterday, Mr Perry said: ``I welcome the fact that
traders have been reported to the procurator-fiscal for allegedly selling
drug-related paraphernalia.''
A spokeswoman for the Legalise Cannabis campaign in Scotland said last night
that the police and trading standards officers ``were just going back to the
previous type of repression they had tried before''.
``For example, seeds aren't illegal unless you suggest people grow them,'' she
said. ``I think it's very sad for people who are trying to run a legal
business. Customs have confiscated very expensive books from people before and
it just means that the shop goes bankrupt while the paraphernalia is in police
custody.''

VAUXHALL faces industrial action next week unless it improves its pay offer
following a ballot of the car company's workers.
Union members at Luton and Ellesmere Port, who make the Vectra and Astra
models, backed a walkout by almost four to one.
Tomorrow, unions will give Vauxhall the official seven-day notice of industrial
action, which will include an overtime ban and a two-hour cut in the working
week to 37 hours, in protest at the company's refusal to reduce hours.
Vauxhall says its package is worth about 5%. Fresh talks are now likely to be
held within the next few days to try to avert industrial action.
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union,
urged Vauxhall to hold fresh talks immediately but warned: ``If they fail to
deliver a substantial improvement on the existing offer, then industrial action
is inevitable.''
Mr Roger Butler, chief Vauxhall negotiator for the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union, warned that unless the company moved to reduce hours from 39,
there would be industrial action.
``With Vauxhall Motors being profitable every year since 1986 and returning
these profits to the USA yearly, it is immoral for the company not to give the
employees their fair share,'' he said. ``With productivity at an all-time high
and labour costs down, the workers have an unanswerable case for shorter hours
and increased wages.''
The company described the offer, which includes an extra day's holiday,
improved sickness and accident benefits and a subsidised car scheme for
long-serving employees, as ``generous'' and maintained it would be worth 5% to
workers over the next year.
At Ford, union leaders will meet tomorrow to discuss their negotiators'
rejection of a pay offer worth more than 9% over the next two years.
Mr Bruce Warman, Vauxhall's director of personnel, said: ``We believe that if
you look around there are not many offers as fair as ours, either in our
industry or throughout the economy as a whole. We are not prepared to reduce
the working week because that would reduce our competitiveness.''
He waned that industrial action would be damaging to the people as well as the
company.

<HEADLINE>Report predicts changes to mixed-sex ward policy</HEADLINE>

MIXED-SEX wards in Scottish psychiatric hospitals are set to become less common
because of the potential for ``inappropriate'' sexual relationships, it was
forecast yesterday by a leading figure in the mental welfare field.
Greater emphasis will be put on single-sex accommodation, maintained Dr James
Dyer, who said he believed people rightly were starting to re-appraise the
policy. The Director of the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland said
drawbacks were being recognised and revealed the NHS management in Scotland was
discussing the issue with health boards.
He was speaking in Edinburgh, where the Commission's annual report was
presented by chairman Sheriff Hazel Aronson QC.
Dr Dyer said unfortunate incidents caused by loss of inhibitions and increased
sexual activity could happen, putting extra difficulties on staff looking after
patient safety.
Cases this year, he disclosed, had included those of women whose mental state
had left them vulnerable to inappropriate sexual advances from male patients.
``I think it is increasingly being recognised, and called for by women in
particular, that choice should be available.''
He said relatives found these situations difficult to understand because they
naturally believed their relative was in hospital for protection as well as
treatment.
Dr Dyer said: ``People should be able to be looked after in single-sex wards if
that is their wish.''
The commission also voiced concern about the ``very difficult problem'' facing
psychiatric hospitals of drug abuse, which appeared to be an increasing problem
in young people with psychotic illness, especially males.
``It is clear drug abuse presents a major problem for psychiatric hospitals in
maintaining an environment which is safe for patients.''
This caused problems because it could exacerbate a patient's condition and
there was the potential ``to pose a threat'' to other patients.
Sheriff Aronson said they were also concerned at the rising evidence of a lack
of knowledge among a wide range of people involved in implementing Scotland's
mental health law provisions.
Commenting later, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Scots Health Minister, said it
was essential those operating the Act should have a clear understanding of its
provisions if the rights of the vulnerable individuals the 1984 Act exists to
protect were to be safeguarded.
The Minister said they would be drawing this to the attention of the
appropriate health and social work authorities.

THE building industry has never recovered from the early nineties recession,
and the latest GDP figures show that construction output in the third quarter
was 3% lower than it was a year earlier.
Activity in the sector is about 88% of its 1990 level. Even manufacturing
output, which also suffered grievously in the recession, is a little higher
than it was in 1990. Overall GDP is about 6.5% above 1990 levels, despite the
recession-induced downturn at the start of the decade.
The housing market is in the doldrums and the demand for industrial buildings
is at a low level, while public sector spending is being tightly controlled.
This year's public spending round could turn out to be tough enough to justify
the #5000m of tax cuts that many independent economists are forecasting will be
the centre piece of next week's Budget. If so, it seems likely that planned
infra-structure spending by the state will be clobbered.
Some pre-Budget calculations envisage the Chancellor saving #2000m as a result
of wielding his axe in this area. Economically there is no real justification
for robbing Peter to pay Paul by cutting back on major public sector projects
to finance reductions in the burden of income tax.
It is unlikely that the building industry will be given a fillip by special
measures to encourage a recovery in the housing market.
Restoring mortgage interest tax relief, which has been savagely reduced in
recent Budgets, would be horrendously expensive in terms of the money the
Chancellor might have available for tax cuts.
Schemes to compensate home owners saddled with negative equity or to encourage
first-time buyers, whose interest is considered an essential element in a
healthy housing market, would also strain the public finances.
The Chancellor may well also grudge the #600m cost of abolishing stamp duty on
house purchases of #60,000 and above. Speculation that his Budget might contain
such a measure could be deterring potential buyers even now.
The cost of raising the point at which stamp duty bites or of exempting the
first #60,000 altogether, regardless of the ultimate size of the transaction,
would be much less.
The housing sector is adjusting to a low inflation environment and the
realisation by the public that home ownership is just what it means, not the
investment coup that it often seemed in the eighties.
The market in residential property would benefit from sustainable tax cuts and
from lower interest rates, but there are no quick fixes around.
However, capital spending cuts in the public sector would inevitably exacerbate
the problems of a demoralised construction industry.
Surge ends
THE cyclical surge in paper prices is already coming to an end, with Rexam
declaring that prices could soon start declining as a result of weak demand.
This follows Arjo Wiggins' profits warning last week. It reported that some of
its mills were working to just 50% of capacity and said it intended to
rationalise its European manufacturing activities.
The upward surge in prices was dramatic in the context of overall levels of
inflation, with fine paper prices rising about 35% this year and newsprint by
much more.
The upturn was a normal cyclical response to weak prices earlier and was helped
by strengthening economies last year and by the effects of newer rapidly
expanding markets like the Asia-Pacific region where demand for paper and board
has been growing by 12% a year.
The upswing was well signposted and users reacted by building up stocks for
fear of further price increases to come. Now they are running down stocks while
demand is starting to be choked off by the high prices.
It is unclear whether they will actually start to fall again or merely
stabilise. If the demand shortfall reflects destocking rather than a weaker
underlying picture then a rapid fall in prices is unlikely.
In addition, prices for the immediate raw material, pulp, have held up well so
paper manufacturers will be keen to keep their prices up. They have not been
able to pass on all their raw material cost increases so margins have come
under pressure.
Happy story
A HAPPY Panorama story - perhaps in contrast to an event elsewhere.
The Australian mining company Panorama Resources, which will be looking for a
London quotation in about six months, is expected to make two or three
significant corporate announcements during the next few weeks.
These include the disposal of its diamond interests in the Kimberley's area of
Western Australia to the world's biggest mining company RTZ-CRA for $A7.5m or
about #3.5m of free carried exploration. Also being sold are its interests in
mineral sands, essentially titanium dioxide used as a paint thickener, for
about #2m and possibly in a year's time the rich Rimington zinc deposit in
Yorkshire.
Panorama will be reinvest the cash in its most promising gold projects.
Admittedly gold has been a dull commodity this year with a range of $374 to
$396 an ounce and currently $386 an ounce. But it is still one of the highest
profit margin operations around with many mining companies able to keep costs
down to under $200.
This is not a share for the nervous at around 36 cents or about 18p for an #11m
market capitalisation. But it could well be a fun share for a Christmas
stocking filler - Mr Walsham is even talking about dividends by the end of the
decade.

<TEXT>
FOR six full days we've held our breath and now, with all said and done and the
kettle power-surge dimming lights from Dyfed to Dundee, we're still waiting to
exhale.
Few subjects were left uncovered but, for all the drama of what was said, it
was eerily calm. Confessional TV. But utterly compulsive at that. Even those
who had sniffed their derision at the TV listings and pronounced themselves too
republican, too royalty-weary to watch, must have stolen a glance at the show
or the highlights.
There are few things with greater pulling power than a princess with a bone to
pick and a weighty current affairs show on which to pick it.
We had been told it would be an anti-climax after the media speculation. The
febrile imagination of the tabloid hack had warned us Charles and Camilla might
be damned as deserving each other. She would positively spit her hatred at the
camera, no-holds-barred, in-your-face, let-it-rip. There might be a little
sneer for the Queen, a venomous aside for Julia Carling, a pained smile for the
Queen Mother.
Instead, what we got was the calm, controlled voice and practically
expressionless face of someone who knew what she wanted to say, how she wanted
to say it, and how she wanted to be seen to say it.
And oh, what she said. Bulimia? Yes. Self-mutilation? Yes. An affair with James
Hewitt? Yes. I adored him, I was in love with him. A cold indifferent husband?
Yes. A campaign against you in the royal household? Yes. It was Charles who
wanted to split? Yes. Do you want a divorce? No. And then the one killer quote.
Camilla? ``There were three of us in this marriage so it was a bit crowded.''
To be honest, one of the biggest surprises of the night was seeing her talk
smoothly, conversationally. She's normally a puppet of a public speaker;
awkward at the lectern with the missed emphasis, irregular breaths and
frantically bobbing head of the absolute beginner. But last night she
positively flowed.
At the start her voice was whispery and conspiratorial. But she warmed to her
theme and by the end she was what she claimed to be, a woman in control,
turning questions around, the shy Di, dipped-head glance transformed into a
lowered, levelled gaze.
``Many claim to have spoken for her,'' said the pre-programme, deep-timbred
blurb. ``Tonight she speaks for herself.'' So she did, and she told us more
than we knew, and much more than we ever suspected.
As the tea grew cold and the tongues wagged late into the night, the
overwhelming impression was that of a royal family a little better explained, a
little less mysterious; and of a princess, stronger maybe, but still as
isolated and remote as she had been at twenty minutes to ten last night.

THE Princess of Wales portrays herself in a number of ways throughout the
interview ranging from a very assertive well-balanced person, to someone who
has been abused by family and friends.
Her language often belies her non-verbal communication, creating either an
ineffective exchange ranging from passive confusion to the veiled aggression of
concealed glee.
It is well-known that non-verbal communication can only be controlled for about
15% of the time - unless a well-rehearsed professional actress plays the role
from ``inside'' the part - and then control of non-verbal cues may rise to
almost 50% of the time. This is why retaking scenes is necessary in cinema.
The viewing public has no knowledge of how many scenes were retaken during the
interview, however the Princess of Wales probably ``believes'' in her fairy
tale which turned sour and was careful to prepare us for her own ``honest''
disclosure by first applauding her husband's ``honesty''.
It is understandable that she should refer to Prince Charles as ``my husband''
and only once uses the name ``Charles''. At another point when describing her
discussion with son William she refers to her husband as ``papa'', and later
when hinting that her husband would be more content avoiding the throne she
exclaims, ``I know the character''.
At various points in the interview the Princess of Wales describes herself as
powerful, and almost arrogantly professes that the royal family or ``those
inside the net'' wonder where she gets her strength from. It is clear that this
lady has a very clear and well-thought out agenda. On many occasions during the
interview she seemed unable to answer questions openly and directly, yet at the
same time is careful to seek loyalty from ordinary people who are open and
honest.
There seemed little concern for others in her dialogue while at the same time
there was much description of her visiting the sick.
There is also a concern that she uses the possessive ``my'' boys referring to
the sons of the marriage, and not ``our'' boys, and while it is clear that the
Princess of Wales would welcome the role of Mother of the King it is obvious
there is an emotional conflict regarding the influence the Establishment will
have over the growth and development of her sons.
Over the piece, the Princess of Wales strikes one as being an introvert forced
into an extrovert public role who has difficulty building adult relationships
where trust is reciprocal, and in view of the events of the last few years this
is hardly surprising.

Martin Bashir: Your Royal Highness, how prepared were you for the pressures
that came with marrying into the royal family?
HRH: At the age of 19, you always think you're prepared for everything, and you
think you have the knowledge of what's coming ahead. But although I was daunted
at the prospect at the time, I felt I had the support of my husband-to-be.
MB: What were the expectations that you had for married life?
HRH: I think like any marriage, specially when you've had divorced parents like
myself, you'd want to try even harder to make it work and you don't want to
fall back into a pattern that you've seen happen in your own family. I
desperately wanted it to work, I desperately loved my husband and I wanted to
share everything together, and I thought that we were a very good team.
MB: How aware were you of the significance of what had happened to you? After
all, you'd become Princess of Wales, ultimately with a view to becoming Queen.
HRH: I wasn't daunted, and am not daunted by the responsibilities that that
role creates. It was a challenge, it is a challenge. As for becoming Queen,
it's, it was never at the forefront of my mind when I married my husband: it
was a long way off that thought. The most daunting aspect was the media
attention, because my husband and I, we were told when we got engaged that the
media would go quietly, and it didn't; and then when we were married they said
it would go quietly and it didn't; and then it started to focus very much on
me, and I seemed to be on the front of a newspaper every single day, which is
an isolating experience, and the higher the media put you, place you, is the
bigger the drop. And I was very aware of that.
MB: How did you handle the transition from being Lady Diana Spencer to the most
photographed, the most talked-about, woman in the world?
HRH: Well, it took a long time to understand why people were so interested in
me, but I assumed it was because my husband had done a lot of wonderful work
leading up to our marriage and our relationship. But then I, during the years
you see yourself as a good product that sits on a shelf and sells well, and
people make a lot of money out of you.
MB: It's been suggested in some newspapers that you were left largely to cope
with your new status on your own. Do you feel that was your experience?
HRH: Yes I do, on reflection. But then here was a situation which hadn't ever
happened before in history, in the sense that the media were everywhere, and
here was a fairy story that everybody wanted to work. And so it was, it was
isolating, but it was also a situation where you couldn't indulge in feeling
sorry for yourself: you had to either sink or swim. And you had to learn that
very fast.
MB: And what did you do?
HRH: I swam. We went to Alice Springs, to Australia, and we went and did a
walkabout, and I said to my husband: `What do I do now?' And he said, `Go over
to the other side and speak to them.' I said, `I can't, I just can't.' He said:
`Well, you've got to do it.' And he went off and did his bit, and I went off
and did my bit. It practically finished me off there and then, and I suddenly
realised - I went back to our hotel room and realised the impact that, you
know, I had to sort myself out. We had a six-week tour - four weeks in
Australia and two weeks in New Zealand - and by the end, when we flew back from
New Zealand, I was a different person. I realised the sense of duty, the level
of intensity of interest, and the demanding role I now found myself in.
MB: Were you overwhelmed by the pressure from people initially?
HRH: Yes, I was very daunted because as far as I was concerned I was a fat,
chubby, 20-year-old, 21-year-old, and I couldn't understand the level of
interest.
MB: At this early stage, would you say that you were happily married?
HRH: Very much so. But, the pressure on us both as a couple with the media was
phenomenal, and misunderstood by a great many people. We'd be going round
Australia, for instance, and all you could hear was, oh, she's on the other
side. Now, if you're a man, like my husband a proud man, you mind about that if
you hear it every day for four weeks. And you feel low about it, instead of
feeling happy and sharing it.
MB: When you say `she's on the other side', what do you mean?
HRH: Well, they weren't on the right side to wave at me or to touch me.
MB: So they were expressing a preference even then for you rather than your
husband?
HRH: Yes - which I felt very uncomfortable with, and I felt it was unfair,
because I wanted to share.
MB: But were you flattered by the media attention particularly?
HRH: No, not particularly, because with the media attention came a lot of
jealousy, a great deal of complicated situations arose because of that.
MB: At this early stage in your marriage, what role did you see for yourself as
Princess of Wales? Did you have an idea of the role that you might like to
fulfil?
HRH: No, I was very confused by which area I should go into. Then I found
myself being more and more involved with people who were rejected by society -
with, I'd say, drug addicts, alcoholism, battered this, battered that - and I
found an affinity there. And I respected very much the honesty I found on that
level with people I met, because in hospices, for instance, when people are
dying they're much more open and more vulnerable, and much more real than other
people. And I appreciated that.
MB: Had the palace given any thought to the role that you might have as
Princess of Wales?
HRH: No, no-one sat me down with a piece of paper and said: `This is what is
expected of you.' But there again, I'm lucky enough in the fact that I have
found my role, and I'm very conscious of it, and I love being with people.
MB: So you very much created the role that you would pursue for yourself
really? That was what you did?
HRH: I think so. I remember when I used to sit on hospital beds and hold
people's hands, people used to be sort of shocked because they said they'd
never seen this before, and to me it was quite a normal thing to do. And when I
saw the reassurance that an action like that gave, I did it everywhere, and
will always do that.
MB: It wasn't long after the wedding before you became pregnant. What was your
reaction when you learned that the child was a boy?
HRH: Enormous relief. I felt the whole country was in labour with me. Enormous
relief. But I had actually known William was going to be a boy, because the
scan had shown it, so it caused no surprise.
MB: Had you always wanted to have a family?
HRH: Yes, I came from a family where there were four of us, so we had enormous
fun there. And then William and Harry arrived - fortunately two boys, it would
have been a little tricky if it had been two girls - but that in itself brings
the responsibilities of bringing them up, William's future being as it is, and
Harry like a form of a back-up in that aspect.
MB: How did the rest of the royal family react when they learned that the child
that you were to have was going to be a boy?
HRH: Well, everybody was thrilled to bits. It had been quite a difficult
pregnancy - I hadn't been very well throughout it - so by the time William
arrived it was a great relief because it was all peaceful again, and I was well
for a time. Then I was unwell with post-natal depression, which no-one ever
discusses, post-natal depression, you have to read about it afterwards, and
that in itself was a bit of a difficult time. You'd wake up in the morning
feeling you didn't want to get out of bed, you felt misunderstood, and just
very, very low in yourself.
MB: Was this completely out of character for you?
HRH: Yes, very much so. I never had had a depression in my life. But then when
I analysed it I could see that the changes I'd made in the last year had all
caught up with me, and my body had said: `We want a rest.'
MB: So what treatment did you actually receive?
HRH: I received a great deal of treatment, but I knew in myself that actually
what I needed was space and time to adapt to all the different roles that had
come my way. I knew I could do it, but I needed people to be patient and give
me the space to do it.
MB: When you say all of the different roles that had come your way, what do you
mean?
HRH: Well, it was a very short space of time: in the space of a year my whole
life had changed, turned upside down, and it had its wonderful moments, but it
also had challenging moments. And I could see where the rough edges needed to
be smoothed.
MB: What was the family's reaction to your post-natal depression?
HRH: Well maybe I was the first person ever to be in this family who ever had a
depression or was ever openly tearful. And obviously that was daunting, because
if you've never seen it before how do you support it?
MB: What effect did the depression have on your marriage?
HRH: Well, it gave everybody a wonderful new label - Diana's unstable and
Diana's mentally unbalanced. And unfortunately that seems to have stuck on and
off over the years.
MB: Are you saying that that label stuck within your marriage?
HRH: I think people used it and it stuck, yes.
MB: According to press reports, it was suggested that it was around this time
things became so difficult that you actually tried to injure yourself.
HRH: Mmm. When no-one listens to you, or you feel no-one's listening to you,
all sorts of things start to happen. For instance you have so much pain inside
yourself that you try and hurt yourself on the outside because you want help,
but it's the wrong help you're asking for. People see it as crying wolf or
attention-seeking, and they think because you're in the media all the time
you've got enough attention, inverted commas. But I was actually crying out
because I wanted to get better in order to go forward and continue my duty and
my role as wife, mother, Princess of Wales. So yes, I did inflict upon myself.
I didn't like myself, I was ashamed because I couldn't cope with the pressures.
MB: What did you actually do?
HRH: Well, I just hurt my arms and my legs; and I work in environments now
where I see women doing similar things and I'm able to understand completely
where they're coming from.
MB: What was your husband's reaction to this, when you began to injure yourself
in this way?
HRH: Well, I didn't actually always do it in front of him. But obviously anyone
who loves someone would be very concerned about it.
MB: Did he understand what was behind the physical act of hurting yourself, do
you think?
HRH: No, but then not many people would have taken the time to see that.
MB: Were you able to admit that you were in fact unwell, or did you feel
compelled simply to carry on performing as the Princess of Wales?
HRH: I felt compelled to perform. Well, when I say perform, I was compelled to
go out and do my engagements and not let people down and support them and love
them. And in a way by being out in public they supported me, although they
weren't aware just how much healing they were giving me, and it carried me
through.
MB: But did you feel that you had to maintain the public image of a successful
Princess of Wales?
HRH: Yes I did, yes I did.
MB: The depression was resolved, as you say, but it was subsequently reported
that you suffered bulimia. Is that true?
HRH: Yes, I did. I had bulimia for a number of years. And that's like a secret
disease. You inflict it upon yourself because your self-esteem is at a low ebb,
and you don't think you're worthy or valuable. You fill your stomach up four or
five times a day - some do it more - and it gives you a feeling of comfort.
It's like having a pair of arms around you, but it's temporarily, temporary.
Then you're disgusted at the bloatedness of your stomach, and then you bring it
all up again. And it's a repetitive pattern which is very destructive to
yourself.
MB: How often would you do that on a daily basis?
HRH: Depends on the pressures going on. If I'd been on what I call an awayday,
or I'd been up part of the country all day, I'd come home feeling pretty empty,
because my engagements at that time would be to do with people dying, people
very sick, people's marriage problems, and I'd come home and it would be very
difficult to know how to comfort myself having been comforting lots of other
people, so it would be a regular pattern to jump into the fridge. It was a
symptom of what was going on in my marriage.
I was crying out for help, but giving the wrong signals, and people were using
my bulimia as a coat on a hanger: they decided that was the problem - Diana was
unstable.
MB: Instead of looking behind the symptom at the cause.
HRH: Uh,uh.
MB: What was the cause?
HRH: The cause was the situation where my husband and I had to keep everything
together because we didn't want to disappoint the public, and yet obviously
there was a lot of anxiety going on within our four walls.
MB: Do you mean between the two of you?
HRH: Uh,uh.
MB: And so you subjected yourself to this phase of bingeing and vomiting?
HRH: You could say the word subjected, but it was my escape mechanism, and it
worked, for me, at that time.
MB: Did you seek help from any other members of the royal family?
HRH: No. You, you have to know that when you have bulimia you're very ashamed
of yourself and you hate yourself, so - and people think you're wasting food -
so you don't discuss it with people. And the thing about bulimia is your weight
always stays the same, whereas with anorexia you visibly shrink. So you can
pretend the whole way through. There's no proof.
MB: When you say people would think you were wasting food, did anybody suggest
that to you?
HRH: Oh yes, a number of times.
MB: What was said?
HRH: Well, it was just, `I suppose you're going to waste that food later on?'
And that was pressure in itself. And of course I would, because it was my
release valve.
MB: How long did this bulimia go on for?
HRH: A long time, a long time. But I'm free of it now.
MB: Two years, three years?
HRH: Mmm. A little bit more than that.
Caption on screen: Press reports of difficulties in the royal marriage began to
emerge.
MB: According to reports in the national press, it was at around this time that
you began to experience difficulties in your marriage, in your relationship to
the Prince of Wales. Is that true?
HRH: Well, we were a newly married couple, so obviously we had those pressures
too, and we had the media, who were completely fascinated by everything we did.
And it was difficult to share that load, because I was the one who was always
pitched out front, whether it was my clothes, what I said, what my hair was
doing, everything - which was a pretty dull subject, actually, and it's been
exhausted over the years - when actually what we wanted to be, what we wanted
supported was our work, and as a team.
MB: What effect did the press interest in you have on your marriage?you ever
personally assist him with the writing of his book?
HRH: A lot of people saw the distress that my life was in, and they felt it was
a supportive thing to help in the way that they did.
MB: Did you allow your friends, your close friends, to speak to Andrew Morton?
HRH: Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
MB: Why?
HRH: I was at the end of my tether. I was desperate. I think I was so fed up
with being seen as someone who was a basket-case, because I am a very strong
person and I know that causes complications in the system that I live in.
MB: How would a book change that?
HRH: I don't know. Maybe people have a better understanding, maybe there's a
lot of women out there who suffer on the same level but in a different
environment, who are unable to stand up for themselves because their
self-esteem is cut into two. I don't know.
MB: What effect do you think the book had on your husband and the royal family?
HRH: I think they were shocked and horrified and very disappointed.
MB: Can you understand why?
HRH: I think Mr Dimbleby's book was a shock to a lot of people and
disappointment as well.
MB: What effect did Andrew Morton's book have on your relationship with the
Prince of Wales?
HRH: Well, what had been hidden - or rather what we thought had been hidden
-then became out in the open and was spoken about on a daily basis, and the
pressure was for us to sort ourselves out in some way. Were we going to stay
together or were we going to separate? And the word separation and divorce kept
coming up in the media on a daily basis.
MB: What happened after the book was published?
HRH: Well, we struggled along. We did our engagements together. And in our
private life it was obviously turbulent.
MB: Did things come to a head?
HRH: Yes, slowly, yes. My husband and I, we discussed it very calmly. We could
see what the public were requiring. They wanted clarity of a situation that was
obviously becoming intolerable.
MB: So what happened?
HRH: So we got the lawyers together, we discussed separation - obviously there
were a lot of people to discuss it with: the Prime Minister, Her Majesty -and
then it moved itself, so to speak.
MB: By the December of that year, as you say, you'd agreed to a legal
separation. What were your feelings at the time?
HRH: Deep, deep, profound sadness. Because we had struggled to keep it going,
but obviously we'd both run out of steam. And in a way I suppose it could have
been a relief for us both that we'd finally made our minds up. But my husband
asked for the separation and I supported it.
MB: It was not your idea?
HRH: No. Not at all. I come from a divorced background, and I didn't want to go
into that one again.
MB: What happened next?
HRH: We, I asked my husband if we could put the announcement out before the
children came back from school for Christmas holidays because they were
protected in the school they were at. And he did that, and it came out on
December 9th. I was on an engagement up north. I heard it on the radio, and it
was just very, very sad. Really sad. The fairy tale had come to an end, and
most importantly our marriage had taken a turn, different turn.
MB: Did you tell your children that you were going to separate?
HRH: Yes. I went down a week beforehand, and explained to them what was
happening. And they took it as children do - lots of questions - and I hoped I
was able to reassure them. But, who knows?
MB: What effect do you think the announcement had on them?
HRH: I think the announcement had a huge effect on me and Charles, really, and
the children were very much out of it, in the sense that they were tucked away
at school.
MB: Once the separation had occurred, moving to 1993, what happened during that
period?
HRH: People's agendas changed overnight. I was now separated wife of the Prince
of Wales, I was a problem, I was a liability (seen as), and how are we going to
deal with her? This hasn't happened before.
MB: Who was asking those questions?
HRH: People around me, people in this environment, and......
MB: The royal household?
HRH: People in my environment, yes, yes.
MB: And they began to see you as a problem?
HRH: Yes, very much so, uh,uh.
MB: How did that show itself?
HRH: By visits abroad being blocked, by things that had come naturally my way
being stopped, letters going, that got lost, and various things.
MB: So despite the fact that your interest was always to continue with your
duties, you found that your duties were being held from you?
HRH: Yes. Everything changed after we separated, and life became very difficult
then for me.
MB: Who was behind that change?
HRH: Well, my husband's side were very busy stopping me.
Caption: 1992 - Details of an alleged telephone conversation between the Prince
of Wales and James Gilbey were published. He referred to her as Squidgy.
MB: What was your reaction when news broke of allegedly a telephone
conversation between you and Mr James Gilbey having been recorded?
HRH: I felt very protective about James because he'd been a very good friend to
me and was a very good friend to me, and I couldn't bear that his life was
going to be messed up because he had the connection with me. And that worried
me. I'm very protective about my friends.
MB: Did you have the alleged telephone conversation?
HRH: Yes we did, absolutely we did. Yup, we did.
MB: On that tape, Mr Gilbey expresses his affection for you. Was that
transcript accurate?
HRH: Yes. I mean he is a very affectionate person. But the implications of that
conversation were that we'd had an adulterous relationship, which was not true.
MB: Have you any idea how that conversation came to be published in the
national press?
HRH: No, but it was done to harm me in a serious manner, and that was the first
time I'd experienced what it was like to be outside the net, so to speak, and
not be in the family.
MB: What do you think the purpose was behind it?
HRH: It was to make the public change their attitude towards me. It was, you
know, if we are going to divorce, my husband would hold more cards than I would
- it was very much a poker game, chess game.
MB: There were also a series of telephone calls which allegedly were made by
you to a Mr Oliver Hoare. Did you make what were described as nuisance phone
calls?
HRH: I was reputed to have made 300 telephone calls in a very short space of
time which, bearing in mind my lifestyle at that time, made me a very busy
lady. No, I didn't, I didn't. But that again was a huge move to discredit me,
and very nearly did me in, the injustice of it, because I did my own homework
on that subject, and consequently found out that a young boy had done most of
them. But I read that I'd done them all. Mr Hoare told me that his lines were
being tapped by the local police station. He said, you know, don't ring. So I
didn't, but somebody clearly did.
MB: Had you made any of those calls at all?
HRH: I used to, yes, I had rung up, yes.
MB: Once, twice, three times?
HRH: I don't know. Over a period of six to nine months, a few times, but
certainly not in an obsessive manner, no.
MB: Do you really believe that a campaign was being waged against you?
HRH: Yes I did, absolutely, yeah.
MB: Why?
HRH: I was the separated wife of the Prince of Wales, I was a problem, full
stop. Never happened before, what do we do with her?
MB: Can't we pack her off to somewhere quietly rather than campaign against her?
HRH: She won't go quietly, that's the problem. I'll fight to the end, because I
believe that I have a role to fulfil, and I've got two children to bring up.
MB: By the end of 1993 you had suffered persistent difficulties with the press
- these phone conversations were made public - and you decided to withdraw from
public life. Why did you do that?
HRH: The pressure was intolerable then, and my job, my work was being affected.
I wanted to give 110% to my work, and I could only give 50. I was constantly
tired, exhausted, because the pressure was just, it was so cruel. So I thought
the only way to do it was to stand up and make a speech and extract myself
before I started disappointing and not carrying out my work. It was my decision
to make that speech because I owed it to the public to say that, you know,
`thank you. I'm disappearing for a bit, but I'll come back.'
MB: It wasn't very long before you did come back, of course.
HRH: Well, I don't know. I mean, I did a lot of work, well, underground,
without any media attention, so I never really stopped doing it. I just didn't
do every day out and about, I just couldn't do it. You know, the campaign at
that point was being successful, but it did surprise the people who were
causing the grief - it did surprise them when I took myself out of the game.
hey hadn't expected that. And I'm a great believer that you should always
confuse the enemy.
MB: Who was the enemy?
HRH: Well, the enemy was my husband's department, because I always got more
publicity, my work was more, was discussed much more than him. And, you know,
from that point of view I understand it. But I was doing good things, and I
wanted to good things. I was never going to hurt anyone, I was never going to
let anyone down.
MB: But you really believe that it was out of jealousy that they wanted to
undermine you?
HRH: I think it was out of fear, because here was a strong woman doing her bit,
and where was she getting her strength from to continue?
MB: What was your reaction to your husband's disclosure to Jonathan Dimbleby
that he had in fact committed adultery?
HRH: Well, I was totally unaware of the content of the book, and actually saw
it on the news that night that it had come out, and my first concern was to the
children, because they were able to understand what was coming out, and I
wanted to protect them. But I was pretty devastated myself. But then I admired
the honesty, because it takes a lot to do that.
MB: In what sense?
HRH: Well, to be honest about a relationship with someone else, in his position
- that's quite something.
MB: How did you handle this with the children?
HRH: I went to the school and put it to William, particularly, that if you find
someone you love in life you must hang on to it and look after it, and if you
were lucky enough to find someone who loved you then one must protect it.
William asked me what had been going on, and could I answer his questions,
which I did. He said, was that the reason why our marriage had broken up? And I
said, well, there were three of us in this marriage, and the pressure of the
media was another factor, so the two together were very difficult. But although
I still loved Papa I couldn't live under the same roof as him, and likewise
with him.
MB: What effect do you think it had on Prince William?
HRH: Well, he's a child that's a deep thinker, and we don't know for a few
years how it's gone in. But I put it in gently, without resentment or any anger.
MB: Looking back now, do you feel at all responsible for the difficulties in
your marriage?
HRH: Mmm. I take full responsibility, I take some responsibility that our
marriage went the way it did. I'll take half of it, but I won't take any more
than that, because it takes two to get in this situation.
MB: But you do bear some of the responsibility?
HRH: Absolutely, we both made mistakes.
MB: Another book that was published recently concerned a Mr James Hewitt, in
which he claimed to have had a very close relationship with you, from about
1989 I think. What was the nature of your relationship?
HRH: He was a great friend of mine at a very difficult, yet another difficult
time, and he was always there to support me, and I was absolutely devastated
when this book appeared, because I trusted him, and because, again, I worried
about the reaction on my children. And, yes, there was factual evidence in the
book, but a lot of it was, comes from another world, didn't equate to what
happened.
MB: What do you mean?
HRH: Well, there was a lot of fantasy in that book, and it was very distressing
for me that a friend of mine, who I had trusted, made money out of me. I really
minded about that. And he'd rung me up 10 days before it arrived in the
bookshops to tell me that there was nothing to worry about, and I believed him,
stupidly. And then when it did arrive the first thing I did was rush down to
talk to my children. And William produced a box of chocolates and said, `Mummy,
I think you've been hurt. These are to make you smile again.' So......
MB: Did your relationship go beyond a close friendship?
HRH: Yes it did, yes.
MB: Were you unfaithful?
HRH: Yes, I adored him. Yes, I was in love with him. But I was very let down.
Caption: 1995 - The Princess of Wales now lives alone at Kensington Palace.
MB: How would you describe your life now? You do live very much on your own,
don't you?
HRH: Yes, I don't mind that actually. You know, people think that at the end of
the day a man is the only answer. Actually, a fulfilling job is better for me.
(laughter)
MB: What do you mean by that?
HRH: Well, I mean any gentleman that's been past my door, we've instantly been
put together in the media and all hell's broken loose, so that's been very
tough on the male friends I've had, and obviously from my point of view.
MB: Does that mean that you feel that for the rest of your life you'll have to
be on your own?
HRH: No, I'm not really on my own. I've got wonderful friends, I've got my
boys, I've got my work. It's just by living at Kensington Palace obviously it
is a little bit isolating, but, you know, maybe we all feel like that.
MB: How do you feel about the way the press behaves towards you now?
HRH: I still to this day find the interest daunting and phenomenal, because I
actually don't like being the centre of attention. When I have my public
duties, I understand that when I get out the car I'm being photographed, but
actually it's now when I go out of my door, my front door, I'm being
photographed. I never know where a lens is going to be. A normal day would be
followed by four cars; a normal day would come back to my car and find six
freelance photographers jumping around me. Some people would say, Well, if you
had a policeman it would make it easier. It doesn't at all.
They've decided that I'm still a product, after 15, 16 years, that sells well,
and they all shout at me, telling me that: `Oh, come on, Di, look up. If you
give us a picture I can get my children to a better school.' And, you know, you
can laugh it off. But you get that the whole time. It's quite difficult.
MB: Some people would say that in the early years of your marriage you were
partly responsible for encouraging the press interest - you danced with people
like Wayne Sleep, you seemed to enjoy it, you had a very good and warm
relationship. Do you feel any responsibility for the way the press have behaved
towards you?
HRH: I've never encouraged the media. There was a relationship which worked
before, but now I can't tolerate it because it's become abusive and it's
harassment. But I don't want to be seen to be indulging in self-pity. I'm not.I
understand they have a job to do. You could equate it to a soap opera really.
It goes on and on and on, and the story never changes. And each time one enjoys
oneself - albeit it's in a different situation - you have to pay for it,
because people criticise, which comes with the patch, as I said previously.But
I am a free spirit - unfortunately for some.
MB: But here at Kensington Palace, are you isolated?
HRH: Well I am by the nature of my situation, yes, but I don't feel sorry for
myself in any way.I've got my work that I choose to do, and I've got my boys,
and I've got lots of opportunities coming up in the next year - visits abroad:
I'm about to go to Argentina, which I'm very happy with, and hope very much to
continue the good relationship that's now been adopted between the two
countries. I hope I can be of help there.
MB: What role do you see for yourself in the future?
HRH: I'd like to be an ambassador for this country. I'd like to represent this
country abroad.As I have all this media interest, let's not just sit in this
country and be battered by it. Let's take them, these people, out to represent
this country and the good qualities of it abroad.When I go abroad we've got 60
to 90 photographers, just from this country, coming with me, so let's use it in
a productive way, to help this country.
MB: You say you feel that your future is as some form of ambassador. At whose
behest is that? On what grounds do you feel that you have the right to think of
yourself as an ambassador.
HRH: I've been in a privileged position for 15 years. I've got tremendous
knowledge about people and how to communicate. I've learned that, I've got it,
and I want to use it. And when I look at people in public life, I'm not a
political animal but I think the biggest disease this world suffers from in
this day and age is the disease of people feeling unloved, and I know that I
can give love for a minute, for half an hour, for a day, for a month, but I can
give - I'm very happy to do that and I want to do that.
MB: Do you think that the British people are happy with you in your role?
HRH: I think the British people need someone in public life to give affection,
to make them feel important, to support them, to give them light in their dark
tunnels. I see it as a possibly unique role, and yes, I've had difficulties, as
everybody has witnessed over the years, but let's now use the knowledge I've
gathered to help other people in distress.
MB: Do you think you can?
HRH: I know I can, I know I can, yes.
MB: Up until you came into this family, the monarchy seemed to enjoy an
unquestioned position at the heart of British life. Do you feel that you're at
all to blame for the fact that survival of the monarchy is now a question that
people are asking?
HRH: No, I don't feel blame. I mean, once or twice I've heard people say to me
that, you know, `Diana's out to destroy the monarchy', which has bewildered me,
because why would I want to destroy something that is my children's future.
will fight for my children on any level in order for them to be happy and have
peace of mind and carry out their duties.
But I think what concerns me most of all about how people discuss the monarchy
is they become indifferent, and I think that is a problem, and I think that
should be sorted out, yes.
MB: When you say indifferent, what do you mean?
HRH: They don't care. People don't care any more. They've been so force-fed
with marital problems, whatever, whatever, whatever, that they're fed up. I'm
fed up of reading about it. I'm in it, so God knows what people out there must
think.
MB: Do you think the monarchy needs to adapt and to change in order to survive?
HRH: I understand that change is frightening for people, especially if there's
nothing to go to. It's best to stay where you are. I understand that. But I do
think that there are a few things that could change, that would alleviate this
doubt, and sometimes complicated relationship between monarchy and public. I
think they could walk hand in hand, as opposed to be so distant.
MB: What are you doing to try and effect some kind of change?
HRH: Well, with William and Harry, for instance, I take them round homelessness
projects, I've taken William and Harry to people dying of Aids - albeit I told
them it was cancer - I've taken the children to all sorts of areas where I'm
not sure anyone of that age in this family has been before. And they have a
knowledge - they may never use it, but the seed is there, and I hope it will
grow because knowledge is power.
MB: What are you hoping that that experience for your children - what impact
that experience will have on your children?
HRH: I want them to have an understanding of people's emotions, people's
insecurities, people's distress, and people's hopes and dreams.
MB: What kind of monarchy do you anticipate?
HRH: I would like a monarchy that has more contact with its people - and I
don't mean by riding round bicycles and things like that, but just having a
more in-depth understanding. And I don't say that as a criticism to the present
monarchy: I just say that as what I see and hear and feel on a daily basis in
the role I have chosen for myself.
MB: There's a lot of discussion at the moment about how matters between
yourself and the Prince of Wales will be resolved. There's even the suggestion
of a divorce between you. What are your thoughts about that?
HRH: I don't want a divorce, but obviously we need clarity on a situation that
has been of enormous discussion over the last three years in particular. So all
I say to that is that I await my husband's decision of which way we are all
going to go.
MB: If he wished a divorce to go through, would you accept that?
HRH: I would obviously discuss it with him, but up to date neither of us has
discussed this subject, though the rest of the world seems to have.
MB: Would it be your wish to divorce?
HRH: No, it's not my wish.
MB: Why? Wouldn't that resolve matters?
HRH: Why would it resolve matters?
MB: It would provide the clarity that you talk about, it would resolve matters
as far as the public are concerned perhaps.
HRH: Yes, but what about the children? Our boys - that's what matters, isn't it?
MB: Do you think you will ever be Queen?
HRH: No, I don't, no.
MB: Why do you think that?
HRH: I'd like to be a queen of people's hearts, in people's hearts, but I don't
see myself being Queen of this country. I don't think many people will want me
to be Queen. Actually, when I say many people I mean the establishment that I
married into, because they have decided that I'm a non-starter.
MB: Why do you think they've decided that?
HRH: Because I do things differently, because I don't go by a rule book,
because I lead from the heart, not the head, and albeit that's got me into
trouble in my work, I understand that. But someone's got to go out there and
love people and show it.
MB: Do you think that because of the way you behave that's precluded you
effectively from becoming Queen?
HRH: Yes, well not precluded me. I wouldn't say that. I just don't think I have
as many supporters in that environment as I did.
MB: You mean within the royal household?
HRH: Uh,uh. They see me as a threat of some kind, and I'm here to do good: I'm
not a destructive person.
MB: Why do they see you as a threat?
HRH: I think every strong woman in history has had to walk down a similar path,
and I think it's the strength that causes the confusion and the fear.Why is she
strong? Where does she get it from? Where is she taking it? Where is she going
to use it? Why do the public still support her? When I say public, you go and
do an engagement and there's a great many people there.
MB: Do you think the Prince of Wales will ever be King?
HRH: I don't think any of us know the answer to that. And obviously it's a
question that's in everybody's head. But who knows, who knows what fate will
produce, who knows what circumstances will provoke?
MB: But you would know him better than most people. Do you think he would wish
to be King?
HRH: There was always conflict on that subject with him when we discussed it,
and I understood that conflict, because it's a very demanding role, being
Prince of Wales, but it's an equally more demanding role being King. And being
Prince of Wales produces more freedom now, and being King would be a little bit
more suffocating. And because I know the character I would think that the top
job, as I call it, would bring enormous limitations to him, and I don't know
whether he could adapt to that.
MB: Do you think it would make more sense in the light of the marital
difficulties that you and the Prince of Wales have had if the position of
monarch passed directly to your son Prince William?
HRH: Well, then you have to see that William's very young at the moment, so do
you want a burden like that to be put on his shoulders at such an age? So I
can't answer that question.
MB: Would it be your wish that when Prince William comes of age that he were to
succeed the Queen rather than the current Prince of Wales?
HRH: My wish is that my husband finds peace of mind, and from that follows
others things, yes.
MB: Why have you decided to give this interview now? Why have you decided to
speak at this time?
HRH: Because we will have been separated three years this December, and the
perception that has been given of me for the last three years has been very
confusing, turbulent, and in some areas I'm sure many, many people doubt me.And
I want to reassure all those people who have loved me and supported me
throughout the last 15 years that I'd never let them down. That is a priority
to me, along with my children.
MB: And so you feel that by speaking out in this way you'll be able to reassure
the people?
HRH: Uh,uh. The people that matter to me - the man on the street, yup, because
that's what matters more than anything else.
MB: Some people might think - some people might interpret this as you simply
taking the opportunity to get your own back on your husband.
HRH: I don't sit here with resentment: I sit here with sadness because a
marriage hasn't worked. I sit here with hope because there's a future ahead, a
future for my husband, a future for myself and a future for the monarchy.
MB: Your Royal Highness, thank you.
HRH: It made it very difficult, because for a situation where it was a couple
working in the same job - we got out the same car, we shook the same hand, my
husband did the speeches, I did the handshaking - so basically we were a
married couple doing the same job, which is very difficult for anyone, and more
so if you ve got all the attention on you.
We struggled a bit with it, it was very difficult; and then my husband decided
that we do separate engagements, which was a bit sad for me, because I quite
liked the company.
But, there again, I didn't have the choice.
MB: So it wasn't at your request that you did that on your own?
HRH: Not at all, no.
MB: The biography of the Prince of Wales written by Jonathan Dimbleby, which as
you know was published last year, suggested that you and your husband had very
different outlooks, very different interests. Would you agree with that?
HRH: No. I think we had a great deal of interest - we both liked people, both
liked country life, both loved children, work in the cancer field, work in
hospices.
But I was portrayed in the media at that time, if I remember rightly, as
someone, because I hadn't passed any O-levels and taken any A-levels, I was
stupid.
And I made the grave mistake once of saying to a child I was thick as a plank,
in order to ease the child's nervousness, which it did. But that headline went
all round the world, and I rather regret saying it.
MB: The Prince of Wales, in the biography, is described as a great thinker, a
man with a tremendous range of interests. What did he think of your interests?
HRH: Well, I don't think I was allowed to have any. I think that I've always
been the 18-year-old girl he got engaged to, so I don't think I've been given
any credit for growth. And, my goodness, I've had to grow.
MB: Explain what you mean when you say that.
HRH: Well, er . . .
MB: When you say, when you say you were never given any credit, what do you
mean?
HRH: Well anything good I ever did nobody ever said a thing, never said, `well
done', or `was it OK?' But if I tripped up, which invariably I did, because I
was new at the game, a ton of bricks came down on me.
MB: How did you cope with that?
HRH: Well obviously there were lots of tears, and one could dive into the
bulimia, into escape.
MB: Some people would find that difficult to believe, that you were left so
much to cope on your own, and that the description you give suggests that your
relationship with your husband was not very good even at that early stage.
HRH: Well, we had unique pressures put upon us, and we both tried our hardest
to cover them up, but obviously it wasn't to be.
MB: Around 1986, again according to the biography written by Jonathan Dimbleby
about your husband, he says that your husband renewed his relationship with Mrs
Camilla Parker Bowles. Were you aware of that?
HRH: Yes I was, but I wasn't in a position to do anything about it.
MB: What evidence did you have that their relationship was continuing even
though you were married?
HRH: Oh, a woman's instinct is a very good one.
MB: Is that all?
HRH: Well, I had, obviously I had knowledge of it.
MB: From staff?
HRH: Well, from people who minded and cared about our marriage, yes.
MB: What effect did that have on you?
HRH: Pretty devastating. Rampant bulimia, if you can have rampant bulimia, and
just a feeling of being no good at anything and being useless and hopeless and
failed in every direction.
MB: And with a husband who was having a relationship with somebody else?
HRH: With a husband who loved someone else, yes.
MB: You really thought that?
HRH: Uh,uh. I didn't think that, I knew it.
MB: How did you know it?
HRH: By the change of behavioural pattern in my husband; for all sorts of
reasons that a woman's instinct produces; you just know. It was already
difficult, but it became increasingly difficult.
MB: In the practical sense, how did it become difficult?
HRH: Well, people were - when I say people I mean friends, on my husband's side
- were indicating that I was again unstable, sick, and should be put in a home
of some sort in order to get better. I was almost an embarrassment.
MB: Do you think he really thought that?
HRH: Well, there's no better way to dismantle a personality than to isolate it.
MB: So you were isolated?
HRH: Uh,uh, very much so.
MB: Do you think Mrs Parker Bowles was a factor in the breakdown of your
marriage?
HRH: Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.
Caption: 1987 -In public the royal couple continued their duties. In private
they were already leading separate lives.
MB: You're effectively living separate lives, yet in public there's this
appearance of this happily married royal couple. How was this regarded by the
royal family?
HRH: I think everybody was very anxious because they could see there were
complications but didn't want to interfere, but were there, made it known that
they were there if required.
MB: Do you think it was accepted that one could live effectively two lives -
one in private and one in public?
HRH: No, because again the media was very interested about our set-up, inverted
commas; when we went abroad we had separate apartments, albeit we were on the
same floor, so of course that was leaked, and that caused complications. But
Charles and I had our duty to perform, and that was paramount.
MB: So in a sense you coped with this, these two lives, because of your duty?
HRH: Uh,uh. And we were a very good team in public; albeit what was going on in
private, we were a good team.
MB: Some people would find that difficult to reconcile.
HRH: Well, that's their problem. I know what it felt like.
MB: The Queen described 1992 as her `annus horribilis', and it was in that year
that Andrew Morton's book about you was published. Did you ever personally
assist him with the writing of his book?
HRH: A lot of people saw the distress that my life was in, and they felt it was
a supportive thing to help in the way that they did.
MB: Did you allow your friends, your close friends, to speak to Andrew Morton?
HRH: Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
MB: Why?
HRH: I was at the end of my tether. I was desperate. I think I was so fed up
with being seen as someone who was a basket-case, because I am a very strong
person and I know that causes complications in the system that I live in.
MB: How would a book change that?
HRH: I don't know. Maybe people have a better understanding, maybe there's a
lot of women out there who suffer on the same level but in a different
environment, who are unable to stand up for themselves because their
self-esteem is cut into two. I don't know.
MB: What effect do you think the book had on your husband and the royal family?
HRH: I think they were shocked and horrified and very disappointed.
MB: Can you understand why?
HRH: I think Mr Dimbleby's book was a shock to a lot of people and
disappointment as well.
MB: What effect did Andrew Morton's book have on your relationship with the
Prince of Wales?
HRH: Well, what had been hidden - or rather what we thought had been hidden
-then became out in the open and was spoken about on a daily basis, and the
pressure was for us to sort ourselves out in some way. Were we going to stay
together or were we going to separate? And the word separation and divorce kept
coming up in the media on a daily basis.
MB: What happened after the book was published?
HRH: Well, we struggled along. We did our engagements together. And in our
private life it was obviously turbulent.
MB: Did things come to a head?
HRH: Yes, slowly, yes. My husband and I, we discussed it very calmly. We could
see what the public were requiring. They wanted clarity of a situation that was
obviously becoming intolerable.
MB: So what happened?
HRH: So we got the lawyers together, we discussed separation - obviously there
were a lot of people to discuss it with: the Prime Minister, Her Majesty -and
then it moved itself, so to speak.
MB: By the December of that year, as you say, you'd agreed to a legal
separation. What were your feelings at the time?
HRH: Deep, deep, profound sadness. Because we had struggled to keep it going,
but obviously we'd both run out of steam. And in a way I suppose it could have
been a relief for us both that we'd finally made our minds up. But my husband
asked for the separation and I supported it.
MB: It was not your idea?
HRH: No. Not at all. I come from a divorced background, and I didn't want to go
into that one again.
MB: What happened next?
HRH: We, I asked my husband if we could put the announcement out before the
children came back from school for Christmas holidays because they were
protected in the school they were at. And he did that, and it came out on
December 9th. I was on an engagement up north. I heard it on the radio, and it
was just very, very sad. Really sad. The fairy tale had come to an end, and
most importantly our marriage had taken a turn, different turn.
MB: Did you tell your children that you were going to separate?
HRH: Yes. I went down a week beforehand, and explained to them what was
happening. And they took it as children do - lots of questions - and I hoped I
was able to reassure them. But, who knows?
MB: What effect do you think the announcement had on them?
HRH: I think the announcement had a huge effect on me and Charles, really, and
the children were very much out of it, in the sense that they were tucked away
at school.
MB: Once the separation had occurred, moving to 1993, what happened during that
period?
HRH: People's agendas changed overnight. I was now separated wife of the Prince
of Wales, I was a problem, I was a liability (seen as), and how are we going to
deal with her? This hasn't happened before.
MB: Who was asking those questions?
HRH: People around me, people in this environment, and......
MB: The royal household?
HRH: People in my environment, yes, yes.
MB: And they began to see you as a problem?
HRH: Yes, very much so, uh,uh.
MB: How did that show itself?
HRH: By visits abroad being blocked, by things that had come naturally my way
being stopped, letters going, that got lost, and various things.
MB: So despite the fact that your interest was always to continue with your
duties, you found that your duties were being held from you?
HRH: Yes. Everything changed after we separated, and life became very difficult
then for me.
MB: Who was behind that change?
HRH: Well, my husband's side were very busy stopping me.
Caption: 1992 - Details of an alleged telephone conversation between the Prince
of Wales and James Gilbey were published. He referred to her as Squidgy.
MB: What was your reaction when news broke of allegedly a telephone
conversation between you and Mr James Gilbey having been recorded?
HRH: I felt very protective about James because he'd been a very good friend to
me and was a very good friend to me, and I couldn't bear that his life was
going to be messed up because he had the connection with me. And that worried
me. I'm very protective about my friends.
MB: Did you have the alleged telephone conversation?
HRH: Yes we did, absolutely we did. Yup, we did.
MB: On that tape, Mr Gilbey expresses his affection for you. Was that
transcript accurate?
HRH: Yes. I mean he is a very affectionate person. But the implications of that
conversation were that we'd had an adulterous relationship, which was not true.
MB: Have you any idea how that conversation came to be published in the
national press?
HRH: No, but it was done to harm me in a serious manner, and that was the first
time I'd experienced what it was like to be outside the net, so to speak, and
not be in the family.
MB: What do you think the purpose was behind it?
HRH: It was to make the public change their attitude towards me. It was, you
know, if we are going to divorce, my husband would hold more cards than I would
- it was very much a poker game, chess game.
MB: There were also a series of telephone calls which allegedly were made by
you to a Mr Oliver Hoare. Did you make what were described as nuisance phone
calls?
HRH: I was reputed to have made 300 telephone calls in a very short space of
time which, bearing in mind my lifestyle at that time, made me a very busy
lady. No, I didn't, I didn't. But that again was a huge move to discredit me,
and very nearly did me in, the injustice of it, because I did my own homework
on that subject, and consequently found out that a young boy had done most of
them. But I read that I'd done them all. Mr Hoare told me that his lines were
being tapped by the local police station. He said, you know, don't ring. So I
didn't, but somebody clearly did.
MB: Had you made any of those calls at all?
HRH: I used to, yes, I had rung up, yes.
MB: Once, twice, three times?
HRH: I don't know. Over a period of six to nine months, a few times, but
certainly not in an obsessive manner, no.
MB: Do you really believe that a campaign was being waged against you?
HRH: Yes I did, absolutely, yeah.
MB: Why?
HRH: I was the separated wife of the Prince of Wales, I was a problem, full
stop. Never happened before, what do we do with her?
MB: Can't we pack her off to somewhere quietly rather than campaign against her?
HRH: She won't go quietly, that's the problem. I'll fight to the end, because I
believe that I have a role to fulfil, and I've got two children to bring up.
MB: By the end of 1993 you had suffered persistent difficulties with the press
- these phone conversations were made public - and you decided to withdraw from
public life. Why did you do that?
HRH: The pressure was intolerable then, and my job, my work was being affected.
I wanted to give 110% to my work, and I could only give 50. I was constantly
tired, exhausted, because the pressure was just, it was so cruel. So I thought
the only way to do it was to stand up and make a speech and extract myself
before I started disappointing and not carrying out my work. It was my decision
to make that speech because I owed it to the public to say that, you know,
`thank you. I'm disappearing for a bit, but I'll come back.'
MB: It wasn't very long before you did come back, of course.
HRH: Well, I don't know. I mean, I did a lot of work, well, underground,
without any media attention, so I never really stopped doing it. I just didn't
do every day out and about, I just couldn't do it. You know, the campaign at
that point was being successful, but it did surprise the people who were
causing the grief - it did surprise them when I took myself out of the game.
hey hadn't expected that. And I'm a great believer that you should always
confuse the enemy.
MB: Who was the enemy?
HRH: Well, the enemy was my husband's department, because I always got more
publicity, my work was more, was discussed much more than him. And, you know,
from that point of view I understand it. But I was doing good things, and I
wanted to good things. I was never going to hurt anyone, I was never going to
let anyone down.
MB: But you really believe that it was out of jealousy that they wanted to
undermine you?
HRH: I think it was out of fear, because here was a strong woman doing her bit,
and where was she getting her strength from to continue?
MB: What was your reaction to your husband's disclosure to Jonathan Dimbleby
that he had in fact committed adultery?
HRH: Well, I was totally unaware of the content of the book, and actually saw
it on the news that night that it had come out, and my first concern was to the
children, because they were able to understand what was coming out, and I
wanted to protect them. But I was pretty devastated myself. But then I admired
the honesty, because it takes a lot to do that.
MB: In what sense?
HRH: Well, to be honest about a relationship with someone else, in his position
- that's quite something.
MB: How did you handle this with the children?
HRH: I went to the school and put it to William, particularly, that if you find
someone you love in life you must hang on to it and look after it, and if you
were lucky enough to find someone who loved you then one must protect it.
William asked me what had been going on, and could I answer his questions,
which I did. He said, was that the reason why our marriage had broken up? And I
said, well, there were three of us in this marriage, and the pressure of the
media was another factor, so the two together were very difficult. But although
I still loved Papa I couldn't live under the same roof as him, and likewise
with him.
MB: What effect do you think it had on Prince William?
HRH: Well, he's a child that's a deep thinker, and we don't know for a few
years how it's gone in. But I put it in gently, without resentment or any anger.
MB: Looking back now, do you feel at all responsible for the difficulties in
your marriage?
HRH: Mmm. I take full responsibility, I take some responsibility that our
marriage went the way it did. I'll take half of it, but I won't take any more
than that, because it takes two to get in this situation.
MB: But you do bear some of the responsibility?
HRH: Absolutely, we both made mistakes.
MB: Another book that was published recently concerned a Mr James Hewitt, in
which he claimed to have had a very close relationship with you, from about
1989 I think. What was the nature of your relationship?
HRH: He was a great friend of mine at a very difficult, yet another difficult
time, and he was always there to support me, and I was absolutely devastated
when this book appeared, because I trusted him, and because, again, I worried
about the reaction on my children. And, yes, there was factual evidence in the
book, but a lot of it was, comes from another world, didn't equate to what
happened.
MB: What do you mean?
HRH: Well, there was a lot of fantasy in that book, and it was very distressing
for me that a friend of mine, who I had trusted, made money out of me. I really
minded about that. And he'd rung me up 10 days before it arrived in the
bookshops to tell me that there was nothing to worry about, and I believed him,
stupidly. And then when it did arrive the first thing I did was rush down to
talk to my children. And William produced a box of chocolates and said, `Mummy,
I think you've been hurt. These are to make you smile again.' So......
MB: Did your relationship go beyond a close friendship?
HRH: Yes it did, yes.
MB: Were you unfaithful?
HRH: Yes, I adored him. Yes, I was in love with him. But I was very let down.
Caption: 1995 - The Princess of Wales now lives alone at Kensington Palace.
MB: How would you describe your life now? You do live very much on your own,
don't you?
HRH: Yes, I don't mind that actually. You know, people think that at the end of
the day a man is the only answer. Actually, a fulfilling job is better for me.
(laughter)
MB: What do you mean by that?
HRH: Well, I mean any gentleman that's been past my door, we've instantly been
put together in the media and all hell's broken loose, so that's been very
tough on the male friends I've had, and obviously from my point of view.
MB: Does that mean that you feel that for the rest of your life you'll have to
be on your own?
HRH: No, I'm not really on my own. I've got wonderful friends, I've got my
boys, I've got my work. It's just by living at Kensington Palace obviously it
is a little bit isolating, but, you know, maybe we all feel like that.
MB: How do you feel about the way the press behaves towards you now?
HRH: I still to this day find the interest daunting and phenomenal, because I
actually don't like being the centre of attention. When I have my public
duties, I understand that when I get out the car I'm being photographed, but
actually it's now when I go out of my door, my front door, I'm being
photographed. I never know where a lens is going to be. A normal day would be
followed by four cars; a normal day would come back to my car and find six
freelance photographers jumping around me. Some people would say, Well, if you
had a policeman it would make it easier. It doesn't at all.
They've decided that I'm still a product, after 15, 16 years, that sells well,
and they all shout at me, telling me that: `Oh, come on, Di, look up. If you
give us a picture I can get my children to a better school.' And, you know, you
can laugh it off. But you get that the whole time. It's quite difficult.
MB: Some people would say that in the early years of your marriage you were
partly responsible for encouraging the press interest - you danced with people
like Wayne Sleep, you seemed to enjoy it, you had a very good and warm
relationship. Do you feel any responsibility for the way the press have behaved
towards you?
HRH: I've never encouraged the media. There was a relationship which worked
before, but now I can't tolerate it because it's become abusive and it's
harassment. But I don't want to be seen to be indulging in self-pity. I'm not.I
understand they have a job to do. You could equate it to a soap opera really.
It goes on and on and on, and the story never changes. And each time one enjoys
oneself - albeit it's in a different situation - you have to pay for it,
because people criticise, which comes with the patch, as I said previously.But
I am a free spirit - unfortunately for some.
MB: But here at Kensington Palace, are you isolated?
HRH: Well I am by the nature of my situation, yes, but I don't feel sorry for
myself in any way.I've got my work that I choose to do, and I've got my boys,
and I've got lots of opportunities coming up in the next year - visits abroad:
I'm about to go to Argentina, which I'm very happy with, and hope very much to
continue the good relationship that's now been adopted between the two
countries. I hope I can be of help there.
MB: What role do you see for yourself in the future?
HRH: I'd like to be an ambassador for this country. I'd like to represent this
country abroad.As I have all this media interest, let's not just sit in this
country and be battered by it. Let's take them, these people, out to represent
this country and the good qualities of it abroad.When I go abroad we've got 60
to 90 photographers, just from this country, coming with me, so let's use it in
a productive way, to help this country.
MB: You say you feel that your future is as some form of ambassador. At whose
behest is that? On what grounds do you feel that you have the right to think of
yourself as an ambassador.
HRH: I've been in a privileged position for 15 years. I've got tremendous
knowledge about people and how to communicate. I've learned that, I've got it,
and I want to use it. And when I look at people in public life, I'm not a
political animal but I think the biggest disease this world suffers from in
this day and age is the disease of people feeling unloved, and I know that I
can give love for a minute, for half an hour, for a day, for a month, but I can
give - I'm very happy to do that and I want to do that.
MB: Do you think that the British people are happy with you in your role?
HRH: I think the British people need someone in public life to give affection,
to make them feel important, to support them, to give them light in their dark
tunnels. I see it as a possibly unique role, and yes, I've had difficulties, as
everybody has witnessed over the years, but let's now use the knowledge I've
gathered to help other people in distress.
MB: Do you think you can?
HRH: I know I can, I know I can, yes.
MB: Up until you came into this family, the monarchy seemed to enjoy an
unquestioned position at the heart of British life. Do you feel that you're at
all to blame for the fact that survival of the monarchy is now a question that
people are asking?
HRH: No, I don't feel blame. I mean, once or twice I've heard people say to me
that, you know, `Diana's out to destroy the monarchy', which has bewildered me,
because why would I want to destroy something that is my children's future.
will fight for my children on any level in order for them to be happy and have
peace of mind and carry out their duties.
But I think what concerns me most of all about how people discuss the monarchy
is they become indifferent, and I think that is a problem, and I think that
should be sorted out, yes.
MB: When you say indifferent, what do you mean?
HRH: They don't care. People don't care any more. They've been so force-fed
with marital problems, whatever, whatever, whatever, that they're fed up. I'm
fed up of reading about it. I'm in it, so God knows what people out there must
think.
MB: Do you think the monarchy needs to adapt and to change in order to survive?
HRH: I understand that change is frightening for people, especially if there's
nothing to go to. It's best to stay where you are. I understand that. But I do
think that there are a few things that could change, that would alleviate this
doubt, and sometimes complicated relationship between monarchy and public. I
think they could walk hand in hand, as opposed to be so distant.
MB: What are you doing to try and effect some kind of change?
HRH: Well, with William and Harry, for instance, I take them round homelessness
projects, I've taken William and Harry to people dying of Aids - albeit I told
them it was cancer - I've taken the children to all sorts of areas where I'm
not sure anyone of that age in this family has been before. And they have a
knowledge - they may never use it, but the seed is there, and I hope it will
grow because knowledge is power.
MB: What are you hoping that that experience for your children - what impact
that experience will have on your children?
HRH: I want them to have an understanding of people's emotions, people's
insecurities, people's distress, and people's hopes and dreams.
MB: What kind of monarchy do you anticipate?
HRH: I would like a monarchy that has more contact with its people - and I
don't mean by riding round bicycles and things like that, but just having a
more in-depth understanding. And I don't say that as a criticism to the present
monarchy: I just say that as what I see and hear and feel on a daily basis in
the role I have chosen for myself.
MB: There's a lot of discussion at the moment about how matters between
yourself and the Prince of Wales will be resolved. There's even the suggestion
of a divorce between you. What are your thoughts about that?
HRH: I don't want a divorce, but obviously we need clarity on a situation that
has been of enormous discussion over the last three years in particular. So all
I say to that is that I await my husband's decision of which way we are all
going to go.
MB: If he wished a divorce to go through, would you accept that?
HRH: I would obviously discuss it with him, but up to date neither of us has
discussed this subject, though the rest of the world seems to have.
MB: Would it be your wish to divorce?
HRH: No, it's not my wish.
MB: Why? Wouldn't that resolve matters?
HRH: Why would it resolve matters?
MB: It would provide the clarity that you talk about, it would resolve matters
as far as the public are concerned perhaps.
HRH: Yes, but what about the children? Our boys - that's what matters, isn't it?
MB: Do you think you will ever be Queen?
HRH: No, I don't, no.
MB: Why do you think that?
HRH: I'd like to be a queen of people's hearts, in people's hearts, but I don't
see myself being Queen of this country. I don't think many people will want me
to be Queen. Actually, when I say many people I mean the establishment that I
married into, because they have decided that I'm a non-starter.
MB: Why do you think they've decided that?
HRH: Because I do things differently, because I don't go by a rule book,
because I lead from the heart, not the head, and albeit that's got me into
trouble in my work, I understand that. But someone's got to go out there and
love people and show it.
MB: Do you think that because of the way you behave that's precluded you
effectively from becoming Queen?
HRH: Yes, well not precluded me. I wouldn't say that. I just don't think I have
as many supporters in that environment as I did.
MB: You mean within the royal household?
HRH: Uh,uh. They see me as a threat of some kind, and I'm here to do good: I'm
not a destructive person.
MB: Why do they see you as a threat?
HRH: I think every strong woman in history has had to walk down a similar path,
and I think it's the strength that causes the confusion and the fear.Why is she
strong? Where does she get it from? Where is she taking it? Where is she going
to use it? Why do the public still support her? When I say public, you go and
do an engagement and there's a great many people there.
MB: Do you think the Prince of Wales will ever be King?
HRH: I don't think any of us know the answer to that. And obviously it's a
question that's in everybody's head. But who knows, who knows what fate will
produce, who knows what circumstances will provoke?
MB: But you would know him better than most people. Do you think he would wish
to be King?
HRH: There was always conflict on that subject with him when we discussed it,
and I understood that conflict, because it's a very demanding role, being
Prince of Wales, but it's an equally more demanding role being King. And being
Prince of Wales produces more freedom now, and being King would be a little bit
more suffocating. And because I know the character I would think that the top
job, as I call it, would bring enormous limitations to him, and I don't know
whether he could adapt to that.
MB: Do you think it would make more sense in the light of the marital
difficulties that you and the Prince of Wales have had if the position of
monarch passed directly to your son Prince William?
HRH: Well, then you have to see that William's very young at the moment, so do
you want a burden like that to be put on his shoulders at such an age? So I
can't answer that question.
MB: Would it be your wish that when Prince William comes of age that he were to
succeed the Queen rather than the current Prince of Wales?
HRH: My wish is that my husband finds peace of mind, and from that follows
others things, yes.
MB: Why have you decided to give this interview now? Why have you decided to
speak at this time?
HRH: Because we will have been separated three years this December, and the
perception that has been given of me for the last three years has been very
confusing, turbulent, and in some areas I'm sure many, many people doubt me.And
I want to reassure all those people who have loved me and supported me
throughout the last 15 years that I'd never let them down. That is a priority
to me, along with my children.
MB: And so you feel that by speaking out in this way you'll be able to reassure
the people?
HRH: Uh,uh. The people that matter to me - the man on the street, yup, because
that's what matters more than anything else.
MB: Some people might think - some people might interpret this as you simply
taking the opportunity to get your own back on your husband.
HRH: I don't sit here with resentment: I sit here with sadness because a
marriage hasn't worked. I sit here with hope because there's a future ahead, a
future for my husband, a future for myself and a future for the monarchy.
MB: Your Royal Highness, thank you.

THE new Digital personal computer assembly plant in Irvine, officially opened
by the Scottish Industry Minister George Kynoch yesterday, has already doubled
its workforce, months after operations started informally.
There are now 600 workers, operating three round-the-clock shifts, producing a
range of desktop computers, servers, and laptops, all produced on a
built-to-order basis.
John McClelland, Digital's vice-president of worldwide manufacturing and
logistics, would not be drawn on current volumes, saying only that they are in
the ``hundreds of thousands''. But, because it was entering the PC marketplace
from a small base, Digital can continue to claim to have one of the most rapid
sales growths of anyone in the industry.
Enrico Pesatori, vice-president and general manager of Digital's computer
systems division, called the Irvine opening ``another milestone in the dramatic
turnaround of Digital's business.''
He pointed out that the corporation, after years of heavy losses, had returned
four quarters of profits in a row and had seen its worldwide revenue from the
PC business grow by 32%.
The Irvine plant, which occupies 77,000 sq ft, ships to customers, mainly in
the commercial and business sectors, throughout Europe, the Middle East, and
Africa.

<HEADLINE>Flourishing EMAP considers further European expansion</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>

<TEXT>
FUELLED by the success of its French acquisitions, EMAP is considering whether
to move further into continental Europe. However, it will consolidate its
position first and launch more titles before expanding into other countries.
Chief executive Robin Miller said it was unlikely there would be an imminent
decision.
EMAP bought 38 French titles from Editions Mondiales last year and these
brought in an operating profit of #6.5m on turnover of #81.2m in the half year
to September.
The company, whose interests also include radio, is confident of a strong
second-half performance despite an expected further slowdown in the rate of
advertising growth.
It bought Metro Radio in September and now has 17.7% of all UK commercial radio
listening.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to September jumped 53% to #33.9m, and the
interim dividend has been raised 48% to 3.5p.
``Once again EMAP's profit growth has been achieved from the successful
integration of acquired businesses and a strong underlying performance,'' said
chairman Sir John Hoskyns.
The strength of its established businesses was demonstrated by a 24%
improvement in underlying profits.
Advertising revenues continued to grow, although the rate slowed from last year
and stronger yields, together with improved efficiencies in the use of paper,
more than matched the impact of rising paper costs. These increased 25% on
average but the actual expense to EMAP was only half that because it managed to
cut both wastage and volumes and to launch a number of new magazines, he said.
Sir John added that the group's newspapers would feel the full impact of the
paper price increases that had occurred during the first six months, although
it was expected future rises would be less than previously forecast.
Operating profits from the local newspaper division rose by 24% to #6.3m in the
half year, although like-for-like advertising growth slowed to 4%.
In July EMAP bought the Herald &amp; Post free newspaper chain in Luton and Hemel
Hempstead from Thomson Regional Newspapers for #7.5m, strengthening and
complementing its existing market.

Apollo stake
THE UK's largest theatre owner, Apollo Leisure, yesterday agreed to link up
with the world's biggest entertainment venue management company.
Ogden Entertainment Services from the US is making a strategic investment by
taking a 25% stake in Oxford-based Apollo.
The company operates 56 venues in Britain, including theatres like The Apollo
Victoria in London and the Liverpool Empire, the Bristol Hippodrome, and the
Edinburgh Playhouse.
Glaxo gets US nod
GLAXO Wellcome's US subsidiary has received early approval from the US Food and
Drug Administration to market the anti-HIV drug 3TCTM for the treatment of
patients with HIV infection. 3TCTM is to be used in conjunction with Retrovir,
more widely known as AZT.
Combination HIV therapy is seen as the way forward for treating HIV-infected
adults who have had no previous therapy.

FILOFAX has proved to be more than just a yuppie wonder. On-going product
development, coupled with a wider customer base both in the UK and overseas,
has enabled the group to prosper despite the difficult retail environment.
In the six months to end-September Filofax increased its profits by 37% to
#2.9m before tax. The company is happy with its margins at 15%, prefering to
grow the market.
Chairman Robin Field said the first half confirmed the board's confidence in
the future. This optimism was reflected in a generous 29% increase in the
interim dividend.
Sales from continuing operations rose by 32% to #18.2m with a useful two-month
contribution from the Topps Microfile acquisition. Its products, at the cheaper
end of the market, complement Filofax's premium range.
Following the acquisition, Filofax's market share in the UK has risen to around
75%. The UK market continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate than in the past.
However, efforts are being made to increase sales in France, Germany and the US.
Elsewhere in the group, the Henry Ling greetings card business recorded flat
sales. It suffered some loss of activity in the charity sector.
However, this business is steadily being recovered and, coupled with the
elimination of some loss-making lines of social stationery, Henry Ling should
perform better in the second half.
Filofax remains on the lookout out for further acquisitions in this sector,
although the organiser market continues to show the biggest growth potential.
Drakes Office Systems lost some own-label business to cheap competition but
margins were held. It is expected to do better in the second half helped by
improved manufacturing efficiency and growth in the patented sticky label
market.
While encouraged by the group's progress, finance director Christopher Brace
would only say the board was cautiously optimistic given the nervous state of
the domestic retail market.
Although Filofax has tried to reduce its dependence on second-half trading
with, for example, its back-to-school range, it still accounts for about 60% of
the group's business.
Despite the good re-sults and generous dividend Filofax shares lost 6p to 269p.
City analysts are forecasting full-year profits of #6.9m compared with #4.9m
previously.

<HEADLINE>Collymore tribunal casts shadow over Forest's big night</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>975274224</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
NOTTINGHAM Forest fear their UEFA Cup clash with French side Lyon at the City
Ground today will turn into a financial benefit night for their former striker
Stan Collymore.
Live television rights and gate receipts should add up to #575,000 - exactly
the amount Collymore will claim the club owes him at an independent transfer
tribunal in London on Thursday.
Collymore maintains he did not put in a transfer request when Forest sold him
to Liverpool for a record #8.5m. He claims the club wanted to sell him and that
he is entitled to 5% of the fee plus a #150,000 loyalty bonus.
Forest manager Frank Clark meanwhile must plot how to defeat Lyon, conquerors
of Lazio. Either he or assistant Alan Hill has watched the French team three
times - and playing three different systems.
Just days after Forest's demoralising 7-0 defeat at Blackburn which ended their
25-match unbeaten Premiership record, Clark has centre-backs Colin Cooper and
Steve Chettle both doubtful along with striker Jason Lee, while Dutchman Bryan
Roy needs a knee operation.
Cooper was detained in hospital overnight on Saturday after blacking out in the
first half at Blackburn. Clark said: ``It was not concussion, and we believe it
is some sort of virus.'' Chettle, sent off at Blackburn, has a back problem.
Striker Lee has a thigh injury and Clark rates him ``very doubtful''.
Norwegian Alf Inge Haaland and Italian target-man Andrea Silenzi, who has yet
to start a Premiership or UEFA Cup game for Forest since his #1.8m summer move
from Torino, are on stand-by as likely replacements.
The return of Lothar Matthaeus after almost one year out with injury has come
at just the right time for Bayern Munich, conquerors of Raith Rovers, as they
prepare to meet Benfica.
Bayern have been slipping in the German league and serious tensions have
emerged between new trainer Otto Rehhagel and the players. But Matthaeus
starred in the libero role in Saturday's 2-0 win over Werder Bremen. The
Germans should start as favourites, as Benfica are struggling in the league,
eight points adrift of leaders Porto.
Werder Bremen face an away leg in Eindhoven, where PSV will have every
confidence after scoring eight goals on aggregate against Leeds United in the
last round and after knocking in eight against De Graafschap in the Dutch
league at the weekend, Brazil's Ronaldo grabbing a hat trick.
Brondby, who beat Liverpool in the second round, will hope to upset Italy's
Roma, who lost 1-0 to modest Piacenza on Sunday.
Among the other matches, there is an all-Spanish clash between Seville and
Barcelona.

SCOTLAND's ``local heroes'' were officially recognised yesterday - the
entrepreneurial businessmen and women who are pioneering new developments in
industry and commerce.
They were invited to North Queensferry, Fife, and a reception at Deep Sea
World, which has become a major tourist attraction, at which Scottish Industry
Minister George Kynoch, and Scottish Enterprise chairman, Professor Donald
MacKay met guests.
The gathering saw 200 entrepreneurs coming together at the launch of a new
directory listing new-start companies which have produced a turnover of #600m,
and employing 9000 people.
Professor MacKay said it was significant that a third of new businesses in
Scotland were run by women, which he welcomed, and hoped the directory would
make a valuable contribution to building economic development.
``If you want to start up in business, here is your `Yellow Pages',''he said,
adding that Scotland had the ability to build a competetive base in a wide
range, forecasting that much of future wealth in Scotland would come from home
grown business.
He commented on the fact that those who became millionaires, either through the
pools or the National Lottery, were recognised - but those who made their
businesses through their own efforts were not.
That attitude, he said, was wrong, because entrepreneurs in Scotland deserved
to have their efforts recognised.
The Minister said the directory listed an impressive number of new and
successful companies in Scotland, started within the last decade.
``By doing so, the book will raise awareness of entrepreneurship, and will
reinforce the central message that the birth and subsequent growth of new
businesses are essential to the future health of Scotland's economy,'' he said.
He added that it was important to develop the economy in a balanced manner,
creating business diversity.
Scottish businessmen and women, he said, are paving the way forward to a new
generation of entrepreneurs.

IT is the way of things for the journalist to make the occasional sacrifice
above and beyond the call of duty. Thus it was that this reporter last night
set the video to record the first episode of the final Cracker (pray God that
it worked) and reluctantly tuned instead to BBC1 to watch that once great
flagship current affairs programme, Panorama.
It is also the way of things for this journalist to be surprised, perhaps even
stunned. What was expected was a vacuous, anodyne interview with an elegant,
well-spoken, woman who - and let's be honest here - is essentially of little
interest to me, my conscience, and my life. Granted, I am a Scot and, as such,
I may well be at a disadvantage.
I thought I simply could not care less about the Princess of Wales. In the
scheme of things her story, sad though it is, is ultimately tiresome;
irrelevent. In this, I would guess, I am at one with a fair number of my fellow
countrymen and women. BBC England has mistaken me for someone who gives a damn.
But, despite it all, Words With Wales was undoubtedly a television scoop. A
true exclusive. The BBC would have been mad to squander such an opportunity.
Looked at objectively, as a piece of journalism, it really was a quite
remarkable interview by any standard.
For starters there was the novelty value. We heard, probably for the first
time, this hitherto remote figure speak at length. We saw the hint of tears in
those beautiful doe-eyes, the nervous chewing of the lip.
But throughout there was always the suspicion that what we were watching was a
choreographed performance. The answers - dare I say it - seemed a mite too
practised; too quick off the tongue.
Ah, but then there were the revelations. Here, it seems, was a bird in a gilded
cage. A woman who would not go gently into the night. Instead, she would rage
against the dying of her marital light.
Diana didn't miss and hit the wall. The smell of burning martyr was heavy in
the air. She left us in no doubt that she was a woman scorned, not necessarily
and completely by her husband, but certainly by the royal household.
No names were mentioned but seldom has there been such a damning and public
indictment of the House of Windsor.
In the early days they were too swift to criticise, too slow to praise. Later,
when the separation occurred, there was a concerted and cynical attempt to
discredit her. A campaign waged against her. But she would not go quietly.
Which, presumably, was why this interview took place.
She knew, she admitted, about her husband's adulterous affair with Camilla.
But all of this, stunning though it was, paled into insignificance when
compared to her admission that she, too, had been unfaithful.
So what did we have in the end? A vindictive woman? Perhaps. But this was a
portrait of a desperately sad person who has had more than her share of despair.

McManus
falls to
teenager
Hunter
SCOTLAND'S Alan McManus yesterday became the second major casualty in the Royal
Liver Assurance UK Championship in Preston when he followed Steve Davis in
making a first-round exit. The world No.6 lost 9-4 to the game's youngest
professional, 17-year-old Paul Hunter from Yorkshire, who yesterday completed
the best win of his career.
The teenager reeled off an amazing seven frames in a row after the Scot had led
3-1 at Sunday's first-session interval.
McManus had begun the match well but suddenly lost his way. Hunter had finished
the first session with four frames in a row but, even at 5-3 up overnight he
could not have expected such an easy passage to the second round against the
normally gritty Scot, who stopped the rot only by taking the twelfth frame.
Mark Bennett reached the second round with a 9-7 win over Dave Harold, the
world No.13, who recovered from 5-0, 6-2, and 8-3 down to get back to 8-7
before the Welshman's run of 54 ended it. Results (England unless stated):
T Drago (Malta) beat T Jones 9-1; A Hicks beat G Greene 9-5; M Williams (Wales)
beat J Swail (N Ireland) 9-6; M Bennett (Wales) beat D Harold 9-7; M Stevens
(Wales) beat S James 9-4; N Bond beat S Gill 9-3; D Morgan (Wales) beat D
Finbow 9-3; D O'Kane (New Zealand) beat M Johnston-Allen 9-4; P Hunter beat A
McManus (Scotland) 9-4; T Knowles beat J Birch 9-7; P Ebdon beat B Pinches 9-7;
W Jones (Wales) beat D Reynolds 9-5.
q SCOTLAND'S world junior champion Alan Burnett moved into the last eight of
the Embassy IBSF World Amateur Championship at Q's Club in Bristol yesterday
with a 5-3 win over Australian John Younger.
The Ayrshire teenager led 3-1, but the Aussie to hit back with breaks of 100
and 63. However, Burnett regained the lead and clinched the match by doubling
the final black.
Malaysian Sam Chong beat Scot James Rushforth, the No.3 seed, with a new
championship record break, clinching his 5-3 win with a run of 143. Glasgow's
Gordon Bain went out 5-2 to European champion David Lilley, of Newcastle.

I'M the listening Secretary of State. Apparently some people claim I listen but
don't hear, but I can't say I've ever heard that.
Now, flushed with the unprecedented success of my inspired ``tartan tax''
soundbite, I have announced that I'm going to publish my Fat Cats Index,
showing how much each local authority is actually spending on administration
and jobs for the boys (I forgot to mention the girls, silly old me).
I must admit I'm pretty chuffed about this spiffing new wheeze of mine. I know
it must be spot-on because of the whingeing complaints it's brought out. Some
folk with subversive political views (ie, to the left of Sir Rhodes Boyson)
have taken to calling me an alley cat, which I assume to be a compliment.
Others have claimed there's not a lot of sense in pointing the finger at the
fat-cat authorities when I'm on the verge of skinning them through reform of
local government.
Still, there's a bit of fun to be had out of kicking a cat when it's down, eh?
This petulant squealing, hissing and arching of the back rather misses the
point, which I must say I feel I've made pretty eloquently. The geriatric fat
cats that I'm about to put down (humanely, of course) are bad enough for
feathering their own nests, but the new breed of prodigal pussies are
positively purring all the way to the piggy bank.
Forgive the rash of mixed metaphors - I didn't get where I am today by
forgetting how, while the opposition huffed and puffed, Harold Macmillan blew
it away with his wind of change.
If you hire ridiculously expensive chief officers, money that would otherwise
be there for extra home-helps, or repairs to the pavement, or important
innovations in the classroom (whatever I mean by that), or bath rails for the
elderly is simply washed down the feline plughole. You can't stop it, because
there's no bath rail to hang on to.
You see, I'm not only the listening but the caring Secretary of State. For one
thing, nobody can deny that I care deeply about education. I care about
overcrowding at Balfron High, which cynics will say is in my constituency, as I
believe it is. I care about Dornoch Academy. I care about that little Methodist
(or is it Episcopalian?) school in Dunblane. It's schools like these that
should become fat cats and will, if there's any spare Whiskas lying around in
St Andrew's House.
Thank heavens the bloated fat cats like that monstrosity Strathclyde (now where
have I heard that before?) will soon be getting their lethal injections. They
threw away mega-millions trying to help folk that can't be helped. They'll not
be mourned, which apparently is more than can be said for Cleveland County
Council.
Even George Robertson, gullible enough to swallow the Constitutional
Convention, would be severely taxed (oops, sorry, George) to credit this one.
Cleveland is getting the heave-ho and is offering its 20,000 employees - wait
for it! - bereavement counselling.
The end of Cleveland, it claims, could be like ``the death of a friend or a
loved one''. Workers could be ``traumatised'' and find themselves ``in
denial'', with a feeling of ``stunned disbelief''.
The stunned disbelief might be understandable if they were incurring the boot
but, oh no, that's not the way of local government. No jobs will be lost and
they'll be transferred to the new borough authorities, often closer to their
homes.
Still, poor darlings, they've been warned to expect symptoms like mood swings,
eating disorders, panic attacks and - the ultimate penalty - loss of libido.
When did you last hear of a local government officer raising a gallop anyway?
So there you have it, loyal Tory voter (oh dear, I used the singular). It's to
be anger, frustration, loss of appetite, and no nookie. Indeed, a common
symptom among these bewildered Cleveland bureaucrats will be ``a reluctance to
do anything''. In local government? Surely not?
To assist them through this distressing psychological upheaval - akin to
listening to a speech by Alex Salmond, perhaps? - Cleveland has 18 counsellors
on hand to help staff to ``tap into their inner strengths''. Out of it all, if
the bereavement counselling is sensitively handled, will come ``a new sense of
belonging''. Too true. The new councils - some of them not big enough to swing
a cat in (fat or otherwise) - will belong to these poor souls who have to be
compensated for the loss of their nearest and dearest.
My pal Michael Bates, MP for Langbaurgh, saw through it. ``The people who
really need counselling,'' he said, ``are the Cleveland ratepayers who have had
to fund years of loony-left policies.''
Quite so, Michael (what a lovely name that is, by the way). Enjoy your last
days in Parliament. Bereavement counselling? There could be nothing more
ridiculous - except, perhaps, Tony Blair claiming that Oratory is just the
sound of his own voice. What Cleveland needs is an imaginative and
comprehensive cremation policy.
Stress counselling for dead-duck authorities is an abuse of the public purse.
There is no justification for throwing good money (or, indeed, any kind of
money) after bad. We Tories have our priorities right. We close this failing
school in Hackney and release the teachers on to the open market, where they
will have freedom of choice of future employers.
And how do we deal with the pupils' stress and sense of bereavement? We don't
give them time to think about it. We shove them straight on to buses and cart
them off to a nearby school, hoping it won't turn out to be another failing
one. That's positive action for you.
Spare the Lochgelly and spoil the child, that's the message. Whether it's chief
officers, local government red tape merchants or kids without a school, let the
pampering cease forthwith. There should be no fat cats - except, maybe, Andrew
Lloyd Webber. If you're even half as smart as me, you might be able to work
that one out for yourself.

<TEXT>
NICHOLAS SOAMES, the Armed Forces Minister and a close friend of the Prince of
Wales, described the princess as showing ``the advanced stages of paranoia''
after her television interview.
Mr Soames said she had portrayed a woman who had experienced great sadness to
the point of ``mental illness'' and he claimed there was no truth in many of
her allegations about the royal family.
Mr Soames, who has remained loyal to the prince through the years of his
marriage break-up and has avoided making public comment, clearly felt that the
time had come to speak out on behalf of his old friend.
He dismissed as ``absolute nonsense'' the suggestion from the princess that
Prince Charles was uncertain about whether he was suited to the role of king.
The former equerry to the prince insisted he was not speaking on behalf of his
friend as he castigated the princess on BBC2's Newsnight programme.
``For my own part as an interested observer I found some of it to be
toe-curlingly dreadful, but some of it I found to be a portrayal of a
desperately unhappy and sad marriage,'' he said.
``What needs to happen now is for a line to be drawn under this and for more
people of goodwill and good sense to wish that both the prince and princess of
Wales will find happiness in their lives in whatever way they wish to pursue it.
But on the princess's claims to have had her mail redirected and phones tapped
- and on her description of friends of the prince as ``the enemy'', Mr Soames
said: ``I really do think some of this was trying to stretch people's
imagination.''
He added: ``All that comes through is this tremendous sadness, terrific
complications, great unhappiness and, I don't know what you call it, but a
period of unhappiness that led to instability and mental illness.
``I can't account for what the princess was talking about when she referred to
those matters, for example, like mail interception and telephones being tapped
and all that, it really is the advanced stages of paranoia.''
Asked whether he recognised the description of the Prince of Wales being
undecided as to whether he should be king, Mr Soames replied: ``Never. I think
what the princess said, with great respect to her position, is absolute
nonsense. I simply don't recognise it as being the case.''
Constitutional expert Lord St John of Fawsley called for a ``constructive and
recrimination free dialogue,'' to redefine the role of the Princess of Wales.
Lord St John said: ``She was dignified, restrained and in no way vindictive.''
He said the interview ``shows how wise they were who did not jump to premature
condemnatory conclusions''.
He praised the princess for being ``consistent and not scheming in saying that
she did not wish for a divorce, she never has''.
The Conservative peer and former Leader of the House of Commons questioned the
notion that divorce would be a final solution to the royal difficulties.
``Divorce is a palliative act, not a resolution. Whatever happens the Princess
of Wales will still be there,'' he added.
She was the mother to the heir to the throne.
``She will remain a prominent part of the royal scene - not Mount Everest, that
is the Queen's prerogative - but certainly Mont Blanc.''
Lord St John went on: ``The important thing now is for a constructive,
recrimination free dialogue between all the parties to redefine her royal,
national and constitutional role.
``As always magnanimity will be right and bring its own rewards. One is left
with a feeling of sadness that a couple of such outstanding and complementary
qualities could not make a go of it.
``The important thing now is to salvage in a civilised and decorous manner as
much as is possible from a tragic wreck.''
Harold Brooks Baker, editor of Burke's Peerage, said the interview showed the
princess to be unsuited to her present role and that of a future queen.
He said: ``I was tremendously surprised that she shows herself to be very
mentally disturbed and a very sad person who has been badly treated by the
world.
``There is no possibility that she is capable of the duties she took on when
she married Prince Charles.
``When she talked of her illnesses, in the way in which she discussed it, she
did not make it clear that she was talking about the past. It seemed as though
she was talking about the present.
``She is a wonderfully tragic person. I feel sorry for this woman but it does
not make sense to allow her to destroy the monarchy.''
The princess had sent a challenge to the royal establishment by questioning
whether her husband would ever be king, said Nigel Evans, editor of Majesty
magazine.
He said the princess had painted an ``extremely grim picture of life at Court''
by describing she felt the prince's supporters were conspiring to discredit her.
``I think the bit that will raise eyebrows was her comments about the monarchy,
how she thought it ought to change and how she thought she was the person to
change it.
``She cast doubts about Charles's future as king and she raised the possibility
that Charles may be unsure. That is an extremely controversial thing to do.''
Conservative MP Sir Teddy Taylor said the interview ``was one of the most
haunting and fascinating I have ever seen.
``She described in detail the agonies people have to suffer in the Royal Family
and she also spoke with total honesty about the tragic break-up of her marriage
and the problems she has faced.
``She didn't attempt to put blame on any other member of the Royal Family.
``The only harsh words were for the Prince of Wales's department who she
thought were rubbishing her.''
Sir Teddy said he thought in the long-term the interview would clear the air on
many issues on which the press has been speculating.
``More important it will have strengthened the royal family by giving people a
greater understanding of the problems and agonies which they face,'' he said.
Sir Teddy said the Princess had emerged as a very powerful person, who had been
through agonies in her childhood and her marriage, but somehow had managed to
keep her head above water. And he backed her appeal to be allowed to act as an
ambassador for Britain.
Sir Teddy said if anyone had any doubts about her ability to carry out this
role, they only had to look at her performance on a visit she made to Japan.
``She probably did more good for British-Japanese relations than all the
politicians put together,'' he said.
He went on: ``I think the one thing to come out of it was that while she has no
personal dislike for the royal family, she did have resentment for the
establishment who appear to be blocking her.''
Mr Harry Greenway, Tory MP for Ealing North, said there would continue to be
sympathy for the princess in the wake of this interview.
He said: ``It was a very sad interview and she is a sad figure.
``But I don't think it changes anything. Yes, I think there will be sympathy
for her, continuing sympathy, as there will be continuing sympathy for the
Prince of Wales and oceans of sympathy for the boys.
``But the Queen remains monarch and that, hopefully, will continue for a
considerable period of time. I would not expect the monarchy to be affected.''
A woman Labour MP said: ``I think a lot of women watching the programme will
respond to her sense of failure and uselessness and will feel she has been hard
done by.
``A lot of men will think she's batty because the male-female divide was right
there.''
Conservative back-bencher Emma Nicholson said: ``I am desperately sad they are
apart. But I am glad she does not want a divorce. It is the worst option when
children are involved.
``If the interview draws a veil on the past, it will be a constructive step,
but not if she uses it as a springboard for future breast beating.''
The public appeared to approve of the interview.
In a telephone poll conducted by Talk Radio UK immediately after Panorama, 75%
of callers said the princess had risen in their estimation after openly
discussing her marriage and her future.
The Other Woman   WHEN the Prince of Wales admitted in a television interview
he had committed adultery, Camilla Parker Bowles was widely assumed to be the
other woman.
His confession came an interview with Jonathan Dimbleby 18 months ago.
Mrs Parker Bowles is a life-long friend of the prince and is now widely thought
to be Prince Charles's mistress.
Last month, speculation of a more public and open relationship between the
couple increased when the prince appeared in public with Mrs Parker Bowles at a
society birthday party at the Ritz, London.
Prince Charles and Camilla first met at a Windsor polo match in 1970. They
shared love of numerous pursuits - polo, hunting, and painting.
However, their relationship cooled after he joined the Royal Navy in 1971.
Although the pair kept in touch for another two years, in 1973, the prince went
to sea on HMS Minerva and effectively sailed out of her life.
A month later, Camilla announced her engagement to Major Andrew Parker Bowles
and the couple were married in July of that year.
However, more than a decade later, it is alleged Charles and Camilla renewed
their strong friendship as the marriage between the prince and princess
deteriorated.
The depth of the alleged intimacy became clear in 1992 when the so-called
``Camillagate'' tape surfaced.
Allegedly a recording of a conversation between the two made in December 1989,
in it he says: ``I love you'' to Camilla and adds many other highly personal
endearments.
However, the Parker Bowles were divorced this year, allowing the possibility of
Camilla remarrying.
Mrs Parker Bowles, 48, now lives in an #850,000 mansion near Chippenham,
Wiltshire, only miles from the prince's Highgrove home.
The Other Man   THE Princess of Wales talked of her love for James Hewitt, the
handsome Life Guards officer labelled a cad after kissing and telling.
She said she felt betrayed when he helped write a book ``full of fantasy''
about their relationship.
At the time, she did nothing to confirm his claims that they had an affair. But
last night she confessed they were lovers. Asked if she had been unfaithful,
she replied: ``Yes, I adored him. I was in love with him.''
The book, written with Hewitt's co-operation by journalist Anna Pasternak,
proved his undoing. It outraged former colleagues in the Army and he was
labelled a cad by some members of the public.
Hostile reaction to Princess in Love forced Hewitt to flee to France with his
mother.
Hewitt, 37, rose to national prominence when he was discussed in the so-called
``Squidgygate'' tape, of a telephone conversation between the princess and her
friend James Gilbey.
Hewitt first met the princess while stationed at Combermere Barracks, near
Windsor, in 1988 when he gave her and her sons riding lessons.
He claimed he was forced out of the Army because of his affair and his
girlfriend ended their relationship after he confessed his feelings about Diana.
Since his book was published last year, he has opened a riding stables in Devon
and lives in a #225,000 mansion.

AS the Princess of Wales attended a celebrity gala charity dinner and fashion
show in the heart of London last night, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh
tried to put their troubles behind them by celebrating their 48th wedding
anniversary at the 67th Royal Variety Performance, with Sir Cliff Richard
topping the bill.
The royal couple arrived at London's Dominion Theatre in a limousine to loud
cheers from a crowd of people who had gathered outside but who had probably
also set their video-recorders.
Meanwhile, Princess Diana smiled as she arrived at her charity dinner at one
minute after eight, looking stunning in a full-length, black, sleeveless
evening dress and white pearl choker. If she had any anxiety or worry about her
controversial interview being screened by Panorama, there was no sign.
The event had been planned for months. Far from being as far away from the
Royal Family as she could, last night of all nights, the princess's decision to
go ahead with her appearance at the dinner placed her almost literally around
the corner from her estranged husband's residence.
The #1000-a-head dinner, organised to raise money for European cancer research,
was held at the eighteenth-century Bridgewater House, which backs on to St
James's Palace, home of Prince Charles.
Over at the Dominion, Royal Variety presenter Des O'Connor introduced the show
with a reference to the Queen Mother's recent hip operation.
He said: ``I am sure we would all like to begin by wishing a speedy recovery to
the nation's favourite grandmother, the Queen Mother. I was tempted to ask you
to shout hip hooray but I decided against it.''
That drew a smile from the royal box and a huge laugh from the audience of
nearly 2000 who had paid #75 a head to see the show, which will be screened on
the ITV network on Saturday night.
O'Connor said: ``Backstage I have not seen so many nervous performers since
Paula Yates said she was going to write her autobiography but I'm sure there is
one big question everyone wants to ask.
``But Bob Geldof could not make it because tonight is his bath night and you
wouldn't want him to put off something he's been planning for four years.''
The Queen and the Duke stepped into the royal box to a standing ovation and the
traditional national anthem, which seemed to be sung by the audience with more
than the usual warmth.
She was wearing a dark blue sequinned silk evening dress and the Duke was
elegant in a dinner jacket.
During the first half of the show, they heard chart-toppers Robson and Jerome
singing their No 1 hit, I Believe, the 1953 Frankie Laine tearjerker that is
their second consecutive No 1.
They are also No 1 in the album charts and No 1 in the video charts, making the
Soldier, Soldier stars two of the biggest names in pop music.
The Queen waved briefly to the audience and gave a half-smile before sitting
down as the curtain went up on the overture.
Scottish comedian Allan Stewart did a series of celebrity impressions,
including TV sit-com character Hyacinth Bucket from the series Keeping Up
Appearances, and told a joke about how she had been bought a chihuahua, saying:
``It's much more expensive than a corgi.''
There were scenes from top West End musicals, including Brian Conley in his
show Jolson, Elaine Paige as the demented woman who kills her lover in Sunset
Boulevard, and the cast of Mack and Mabel singing Tap Your Troubles Away.
As a finale, Sir Cliff Richard looked back at his almost 40-year career in pop
music in the year in which he received his knighthood for charity work.
Meanwhile, among those at the princess's charity dinner were Viscount and
Viscountess Linley and Hollywood actor Mickey Rourke.
The dinner was followed by a fashion show organised by Anouska Hempel.
The couturier said before going into the dinner: ``This has been arranged for a
long time and we didn't know about this interview this evening. I am delighted
the Princess of Wales agreed to be our guest of honour.''
q An aircraft carrying the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh was involved in a
``near miss'' incident with RAF plane, a Labour MP said yesterday.
Mr George Foulkes, chairman of the Commons All-Party Low Flying Group said the
royal party had been was involved in an incident on July 5 after their flight
left Prestwick airport for Glasgow airport.
``There was a close encounter with an RAF plane on an exercise, and it is under
investigation.
``If there is danger for the Queen's Flight how much more dangerous is it for
commercial aircraft?'' he said.
Mr Foulkes said he would demand Ministry of Defence action to deal with an
increase in complaints from the public about the problem of RAF low flying
aircraft and tactical training north of the Border when he meets Defence
Minister Earl Howe.
Figures showed an increase of 46% in complaints in Scotland on the same period
last year, said Mr Foulkes, who has tabled 38 Commons questions in a bid to
discover the reason behind the rise.

STEVE Robinson is unlikely to fight under the Frank Warren banner again after
having issued a writ seeking a further #500,000 against the promoter over his
purse for the recent defence of the WBO featherweight title against Naseem
Hamed.
Robinson's solicitor said: ``The Hamed fight was No.2 on a five-bout schedule
Steve signed with Warren, but the rate for his          second match was never
intended to cover a mandatory defence.''
The Cardiff fighter has secured the return of his WBO belt from Hamed, after
lending it to him when there was no other available to mark his achievement in
taking Robinson's title. But Robinson found it had been damaged.
Henry Wharton and Billy Schwer will have home advantage in their European title
fights in the new year. Mickey Duff, the manager-promoter of both fighters, has
won the purse bidding for Wharton's EBU super-middleweight title defence
against Frederic Seillier and Billy Schwer's challenge for Angel Mona's
lightweight crown. Wharton will fight in Halifax on January 13 but there is no
date yet for Schwer's fight, which must take place by February 10.
q.RESULTS of bouts at the St Andrew Sporting Club last night:
Flyweight - Keith Knox beat Louis Veitch, rsf 6th; super-featherweight - Garry
Burrell beat Glen Hopkin, pts; light-middleweight Brian Dunn beat Billy
Collins, pts, light-welter Dean Nicholas beat Sean Gledhill, rsf 4th.

Vienna, Monday - Saudi Arabia sees a freeze on the current Opec oil output
ceiling for at least the first half of 1996 as a way to boost sagging oil
prices, Gulf sources said.
They said the biggest exporter was also pressing for better quota discipline in
the Organ- isation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Opec ministers meet in
Vienna tomorrow.
Saudi views on setting the ceiling tend to prevail in Opec. Several others
among the 12 members have also favoured extending the current ceiling of 24.52
million barrels daily.
The sources said that if all members strictly adhered to quotas the price would
``rise sharply''.
``The market seems not bad at all - a rollover would definitely bring a higher
price,'' a Gulf source said. ``However we would see a much higher price if they
all controlled their over-production.''
The source said Saudi Arabia was concerned about excess production by some
members - namely Venezuela, Nigeria, and Qatar.
In London, world oil prices were sluggish as markets cooled off after a few
days of upward surges and before Opec begins talks.
January futures for North Sea Brent crude, the world's benchmark, traded down
nine cents to $16.84 per barrel.
Brokers said oil prices, which jumped towards the end of last week, simply
needed to take a rest.

Showering abuse on the amateur brollymen
RESPECTABILITY can be bought. It comes with a handle to it and need not cost a
lot. From #15 or so and up, extras accompany it. Along with being respectable,
the buyer gets to be seen as mature.
But not everything that goes with the purchase is of good report. For instance,
another way to look at the word mature is to see old. Crueller fates may befall.
Sometimes to the new possession attach accusations of being ungentlemanly and
even ungodly. Along with cheaply purchased respectability, owners have found
themselves described also as fops, fainthearts, and fancypants; sometimes all
three.
Such is the rich vocabulary of abuse that has for all time gone with walking
out with an umbrella.
Breaking the habits of a lifetime, I have joined the ranks of the brigade of
armed pedestrians as gamp carriers hostilely have been described. So far the
change of weather armour has worked not badly. As a rainstick it has been
fairly effective. For the time of year since it came into my hand the weather
has held quite fair. Thank me for keeping off the rain.
In an ideal world learner umbrella people would first be tested. They would
have to show all-weather competence. Unlike the drivers of white-hulled
speedboats or the two-wheeled flyers who ride their bikes on pavements, bearers
of brollies ought not to be allowed out unlicensed.
Especially stiff examinations should be set for those who put up in the street
gaudy parasols which advertise building societies or football teams, especially
building societies.
For its maiden passage my rainstick was taken on a trip to Paisley whose rain
has its own soft and dewy quality. Halfway over the first road crossing it blew
out. It felt embarrassing as having the trousers fall about the ankles.
There endeth the first lesson. Before going on to the public highway,
apprentice carriers ought to practise tacking to windward in their own back
gardens and in the privacy of a dark night.
Although one of those gadgety utensils that folds down to a soft truncheon, it
sprang back quickly enough to shape. One proceeded with all dignity. Viceregal
is how a first brolly promenade feels. It breeds the delusion that you have a
hired servant walking alongside to hold your canopy aloft. Presumably, that may
be a part of why umbrella people take up so much room on pavements. They expect
uncovered pedestrians to part from them. I noticed they did so with smiles.
Their beaming countenances were first taken as encouragement. They were
indicating how well the novice was performing. Good on you, young sir, was
their message. It took time to notice that their grins were mainly bemused.
Realisation dawned that no longer did it rain. So intense had been the
concentration to keep the thing out of other people's faces, it had escaped
attention that the sun was almost shining. Mine was the only brolly up in the
street and, maybe, the whole town.
Sheepishly, I fell to marvelling at what great eccentric courage it must have
taken to have been the first cussed individualist to go about the plainstones
as a unique figure under a rain tent. History has spotted this rugged pioneer
and even knows his name.
He was Jonas Hanway, otherwise a jovial and sociable cove, who carried a brolly
(an idea he had picked up in Persia) about London when nobody else did. He
suffered much good abuse. Frenchman! was cried after him, indicating that
street urchins found him effete and foreign.
Like him, other braveheart innovators were accused of being poor trash who
could not afford their own carriages. They were called mean for how they saved
on cab fares. They were even called ungodly. If human heads had been meant to
stay dry, rain would not be sent from heaven was the theological argument.
Demonstrably, therefore, umbrellas defied divine purpose.
Hanway persisted with his odd behaviour until it ceased to be odd at all.
Before he died, in l786, umbrellas had become an accepted piece of street
dress, although not by everybody.
Wellington thought it was out of order for his officers to wear petticoats on
their heads during battles. When the rain fell on Spain during his campaign
towards Waterloo he saw some of his chaps making asses of themselves by trying
to keep drops of water from falling on their heads.
Thunderously, he let it be known that he did not approve of the use of
umbrellas during the enemy's firing and would not allow gentlemen's sons to
make themselve ridiculous in the eyes of the enemy.
Ridiculous has been the least of it. Brolly users have been accused of being
hypochondriacs. They have been sneered at as cissies who took too tender care
of their outer garments. Worst of all was how Robert Louis Stevenson derided
them for how they sought to be respectable; no, that was the second hardest
blow of all.
Coming down most sorely on umbrellas was Christopher North, the philosopher and
gossip, who was born in Paisley where this sociological study began.
Into the mouth of an elderly party North put the dire words: ``Whenever the day
comes that I'm seen unfurling an umbrella, may that day be my last, for it'll
mean that the pith's a' oot o' me.''
Less and less does #15 seem cheap at the price just to keep dry.

MARTIN Currie has raised more than #21.6m for its new Japan Investment Trust,
which is aiming for capital growth of more than 15% next year.
After a long period of decline, the Japanese stock market is bouncing back in
response to a series of measures by Tokyo to cut interest rates, weaken the yen
and stimulate the domestic economy.
Martin Currie fund manager Michael Thomas said he expected the Nikkei Index to
rise from 18,300 at present to at least 21,000 by the end of 1996 and expressed
confidence that the new trust would beat this 15% growth rate.
``We think we can get a return of more than 15% over the next 12 months,'' he
said
Martin Currie began soundings to launch the new trust in August and tailored
specially so that it would appeal to small investors.
The minimum investment of #500 was only a quarter of the #2000 usually required
for subscribing a new trust.
There was a cash alternative for small investors who did not wish to receive
the warrants issued with new shares on a one-for-five basis.
More than 17% of all those investing the minimum sum of #500 took the cash
option, which gave them an effective 5% discount on the share price.
Had they accepted warrants instead, they would have gained virtually nothing by
selling them for about #30 on the secondary market since dealing costs would
have eaten up most of the proceeds.
The Japan Investment Trust will invest in a broad range of Japanese equities,
commercial bonds and warrants with the aim of achieving capital growth. It will
not be locked into any one sector of the stock market.
Subscriptions closed last Friday and dealing and shares and warrants in the new
trust will start trading on London Stock Exchange on Thursday.
Japan Investment Trust is the seventh investment trust to be launched by Martin
Currie, an Edinburgh-based fund management company which has #3800m of assets
under management.

<HEADLINE>JAPANESE BANKING Scandal-hit Daiwa will slash overseas assets by $26.7bn</HEADLINE>

Tokyo, Monday - Scandal-hit Daiwa Bank today said it would cut its
international assets by more than half, or $26.7bn, under a restructuring plan
ordered by Japanese authorities.
The plan commits Daiwa, Japan's tenth largest bank by asset size, to making
drastic reductions in its lending, securities holdings and financial trading
operations abroad over the next 11 months.
The Japanese Finance Ministry required Daiwa to submit the plan after US
authorities told the bank this month to shut its American operations by
February 2 for allegedly concealing $1100m in bond trading losses at its New
York branch.
A senior Finance Ministry official described the restructuring plan as
``drastic enough'', and said the Ministry was satisfied. Daiwa must complete
the plan by October 1996 and report its progress to the ministry every week.
Daiwa said assets related to its international operations, held at home and
abroad, would be reduced by 50.5%. The balance of loans would fall 30.1%, while
securities holdings would drop 50.2%.
The bank said it would also cut back market-related business, such as bond
dealing, at its offices abroad.
The total reduction in assets will be equivalent to 11.06% of Daiwa's total
assets of 18.30 trillion yen as of the end of last March, Daiwa said.
The bank did not say how or two whom the assets would be sold. Industry
analysts expect at least some of the assets to go to other Japanese banks such
as Sumitomo Bank, which has said it will assist Daiwa in withdrawing from the
United States.
The US and Japanese sanctions, imposed at a time of international concern over
the health of Japan's banking system and its opaque management practices, were
the most severe ever ordered against a major Japanese bank.
The US Government also announced a 24-count criminal indictment against Daiwa
that could lead to fines of more than $1000m.
The indictment is based on charges that Daiwa executives were told of the bond
trading losses in New York in late July but failed to report them to US
authorities until September. Daiwa has said it will fight the indictment.
The bank, which must also submit a management reform plan to the Finance
Ministry by January 15, has already said it will cut more than 2000 staff from
its domestic and overseas operations. - Reuter

VICTORIA FREEDMAN examines Scotland's unique marriage mediation service
Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the Lord Chancellor, has had rather a rough time
recently: first domestic violence and then divorce. Both issues were the
subject of reform which received some considerable condemnation from
family-minded and constituency-careful MPs. The Domestic Violence Bill,
although designed to protect the unmarried against domestic violence, was
denounced as undermining the status of marriage. Worse was the Divorce Bill
which was deemed to be socially dangerous by making divorce easier.
The Lord Chancellor may have felt that his intended legislation fell victim to
politics rather than reason, yet experience on this side of the Border does
expose a potential weakness in some of his proposals - particularly in the
English divorce law reform which would impose mediation rather than
confrontations between lawyers.
It is an excellent ideal, intended to reduce suffering and possibly the
financial cost of divorce. However, as many divorce lawyers and separated and
divorced couples know, mediation is not always an option. As one solicitor
says: ``I can think of a number of cases - I have at the moment - where there
is no way one of the parties is going to co-operate. They want their day in
court. And some people need to be told what to do, by the sheriff or judge. So
it's not a solution for all situations.''
Moreover, some believe the Lord Chancellor would do well to look at the
Scottish system of mediation. In England, solicitor mediators work with another
who is otherwise skilled, for instance in child-related issues. Here, for the
last two years, we have had CALM (Comprehensive Accredited Lawyer Mediators), a
group of specialised family lawyers who have been accredited by the Scottish
Law Society as family mediators to work on their own.
``It is unique,'' says CALM's press officer, Stephen Brand, ``in that the
normal Law Society of Scotland conflict of interest rules would dictate us not
being able to speak to two parties who are, in effect, in opposition at the
same time.''
Solicitor mediators may only work, of course, in a case where neither of the
couple is a client. They are impartial, acting not as lawyers to the two
individuals but as mediators with extensive legal expertise. Before undergoing
training - a five-day residential course which includes practical work such as
role-playing - solicitor mediators are required to have a minimum of five years
experience as family lawyers. Therefore they also have the skill and experience
of dealing with people in the midst of a stressful situation.
Their main task is to ensure that conflict is avoided, for this is not the
adversarial route of the solicitor-negotiated divorce.
Instead of dwelling on the unhappiness of the past, which brought the couple to
this stage, the mediator focuses on the future, encouraging the two parties to
work out a practical, non-divisive solution themselves.
That brings another benefit. As couples are not told what to do by the mediator
or what they must do by a judge, a decision that may increase hostility, they
are more likely to make the solution work.
The greatest advantage concerns children. ``Mediation certainly helps a couple
work towards a better co-operative relationship as separated parents,''
commments Clare Craig, a solicitor mediator working in Glasgow and Kilmarnock.
Another positive aspect of the system is speed. The process of law can take a
very long time. With mediation, a long, protracted course of negotiations
between solicitors should be avoided. When the couple are in agreement, their
decisions are simply finalised by their own solicitors in a binding contract.
Even if an agreement cannnot be reached, at least the mediator will have
minimised time and costs, for instance by preparing a summary of the couple's
finances which frequently takes much effort by the two individual solicitors
when using the conventional route to divorce.
``Even if mediation does not resolve practical problems, it can at least
improve channels of communication,'' observes Anne Dick, of the Glasgow firm of
family lawyers, Anne Hall, Dick and Co.
It is therefore impossible to measure the success of mediation or to assess how
many couples are using solicitor mediators; CALM is still in the process of
converting not only the public but also the legal profession itself.
But while convinced of its merits in certain situations, the members of CALM
stress that mediation should be used as an alternative to the court system, not
a substitute, as suggested by the Lord Chancellor, whose proposals carry a
punishment for couples who choose not to use mediation with the potential
withdrawal of legal aid. In Scotland, mediation remains an option which, if
chosen, may be funded by the Scottish Legal Aid Board.
At least the Lord Chancellor is aware of one sensible strand of the Scottish
divorce system. In England, couples may divorce, then sort out their finances
and childcare at a later date. In Scotland, these issues must be considered and
finalised before the divorce.
``I think it makes people think about the reality of what they're doing,'' says
Brand. ``In some cases it may mean they realise what is involved and come to
the conclusion that divorce is not such a good idea. It might save some
marriages.''

I DON'T think I would like to be Kenneth Clarke just at the moment. The normal
dilemmas faced by any Chancellor must look a bit starker than usual this time
round.
On the one hand, we're not that far away from an election, the opinion polls
don't look good, and the noise of backbenchers baying for relief is deafening.
To adapt Billy Connolly: ``Dae something, Big Yin. Wan o' thae miracles!'' The
temptation to produce any sort of market plausible sleight of hand to deliver
lower income taxes must be well-nigh overwhelming.
On the other hand, there is economic reality. We can start by recognising that
since about 1992 the economy has been performing remarkably well by both
international standards and by those of our own record these past two decades
or so. Growth rates for some years have been relatively good. Relative to other
OECD countries that is.
Inflation has been, to this observer, surprisingly modest. It is still not
nearly as good as that of most ``serious'' economies in Western Europe. Much
derided France and Belgium, for example, remain within spitting distance of
only 1% per annum, with every prospect of staying there. But it is better than
we have achieved on an international level for most of our post Second World
War history.
If you look at the inflation position, it begins to seem just possible that,
given reasonable restraint, crossing our fingers, and standing in the dusk with
the light behind us, we could be within reach of a lengthy period of
sustainable, if modest, real growth, coupled with a low inflation regime.
Getting to that stage, and more important, convincing the markets we'd got
there, would be a prize beyond compare.
The obvious reward would be low interest rates. These, in real terms, and
especially at the long end, are still historically very high, and a progressive
reduction would probably do more than anything else to sustain investment over
a long period, and so growth.
Unfortunately, the markets don't believe it yet. And if French experience is
any guide it will take a long time to persuade them. It is, after all, only
three years since the ERM debacle, and Britain's general post-war record on
inflation has not been distinguished.
If it is accepted that a low inflation/low interest regime is a desirable -
probably the most desirable - objective, then any Chancellor is constrained.
The Budget, of course, is an ``event'', but only in rare circumstances, and
then usually those of crisis, does any single Budget ever have a greatly
significant influence. In the current position, the Chancellor, if he wants his
reward in the history books, should probably confine any ``giveaways'' to
modestly up-rating income tax allowances.
Since he will be looking for a reward at the ballot box, too, some more
generous approach seems likely, perhaps involving the standard rate. This would
be a pity, and it is to be hoped there is still time, even now, to offer jam
tomorrow rather than today.
From the financial point of view, I would echo the plea made by David Smith of
Dunfermline Building Society for a progressive continuation of the moves (begun
long ago by Nigel Lawson) towards fiscal neutrality as between different types
of savings instruments. As to the debilitated state of the housing market, I
wonder whether lower interest rates, if achieved on the back of a more
conservative fiscal stance than the markets seem to be looking for, might not
be a better cure than tax changes, at least the obvious ones.
Also from the financial sector's point of view, some refinement of the rules
and procedures surrounding the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) would be
welcome. The PFI was itself a highly welcome innovation. It promises
long-running benefits to public finances, the infrastructure, and, by way of
new work, the financial industry. It is likely, in addition, to provide a solid
base of exportable expertise - practically every country in Western Europe is
going down the same road.
It has taken a long time to get off the ground, but there are now clear signs
that things are speeding up and improving just this past year. Technical
difficulties remain in some force though. Anything in the expenditure rules and
the practical arrangements (no tax cost here!) that could be achieved in the
Budget statement would get a warm reception. The knock-on effects in the
construction sector would also be desirable.
Overall, a boring and technical Budget would probably be best this time round,
for the economy at any rate. The risks of doing less look smaller than the
risks of doing more. Unless the estimable Mr Waldegrave has produced some quite
remarkable reductions in public expenditure, restraint on the Chancellor's part
looks appropriate.
Apart from anything else, much recent comment seems to have forgotten that the
Treasury is still borrowing at the rate of about #600m every week.
In the latest in our series of pre-budget articles by leading figures in
Scottish business and commerce, Grant Baird, executive director of Scottish
Financial Enterprise, examines the dilemmas
facing the Chancellor

MANY family doctors are slow to spot the symptoms of lymphatic cancer, it was
claimed today.
A quarter of lymphatic cancer patients taking part in a survey conducted for
the Hodgkin's Disease and Lymphoma Association believed there was a delay in
diagnosing their illness.
Of 1034 patients taking part, 242 said their GPs were slow to recognise their
condition and 65 reported a delay of more than one year, even though they
displayed classic symptoms.
There is now a higher annual incidence of lymphatic cancer than of all types of
leukaemia. There were 7793 registered cases in Scotland, England, and Wales in
1990.
Symptoms of lymphoma include lumps, tiredness, swellings, night sweats, and
weight loss.
Association director Celine Nicholls said: ``It is important to understand that
not all cases of lymphoma are easily identified and many GPs have done well in
recognising them at an early stage.
``However, this is clearly not always the case.''

n.DON'T even think of buying him that shirt for Christmas, because if you
thought it would get him out of that grubby T-shirt with the hole under the
left oxter, you were wrong. So runs the advice from John Morgan of men's
magazine GQ, writing in the winter magazine from House of Fraser. Gift buying
suddenly presents grounds for deep personal offence: ``Get them something
they'll actually wear rather than something that you want them to wear. Ties
are extremely personal and men like to choose their own - the best presents are
luxurious accessories like fine linen handkerchiefs.'' Not only must we have
the wisdom of Solomon, but the antennae of a TV detector van; poor men, unlike
women who ``are very good at dropping hints about what they want'' find
themselves unaccountably speechless as Christmas grinds closer; seems to me
they deserve those handkerchiefs after all.
n.ON the subject of the House of Fraser, a Christmas date for the man in your
life: a Men Only evening at the Glasgow store from 6.30pm on Tuesday, December
19 (suitably close to Christmas Day because ``men notoriously leave their
shopping until the last minute'') will give him advice and ideas on present
buying. And a date to cross out for all party-throwers hoping to meet caterer
and party designer Johnny Roxburgh at the Glasgow store this week; his
scheduled date was last Friday, when a good time was had by all.
n.SPARE a thought for the WRVS, finding private frozen food companies muscling
inon its traditional meals on wheels service and newsagent chains competing for
customers in hospital concourses. Competition can only be good for the
voluntary sector, however, concluded the Women's National Commission at a
recent seminar. As charities learn how to compete for lottery cash, take on
work previously done by the public sector, and when even the Salvation Army
finds itself signing contracts for work done for social services, members
agreed that groups are becoming more professional, better managed and more
accountable.
n.MORE than 70,000 children will be whisked off to hospital during Christmas,
when accidents in the home rise dramatically due to all the fun new things we
get in over the festive season, like faulty fairy lights, toys small enough to
swallow, candles and presents just waiting to be tripped over. Dettol's Know
Trouble wallchart gives a checklist of what to look out for, although alcohol
barely gets a mention; A is for Always have fun, S is for Santa (rather than
scotch or sherry), T is for Turkey rather than Tennents, and D, naturally, is

<TEXT>
FEARS were growing last night for the safety of a Scots climber, missing for
more than 24 hours in the snow-covered Cairngorms.
More than 20 members of the Cairngorm and the RAF Kinloss mountain rescue teams
were joined yesterday by five sniffer dogs with their handlers and a Sea King
helicopter from RAF Lossiemouth in their hunt for the man who should have come
down on Sunday evening.
Plumber William MacDonald, 44, of Falkirk, was reported missing by his wife
yesterday morning when he had not returned as planned from a climb in Glen
Einich, in the Western part of the mountain range.
Last night, as fading light forced the helicopter to return to base, the
rescuers on the ground searched on into the darkness.
Mr MacDonald, who has four year's climbing experience, was well equipped for a
day's climbing and was carrying food and a small tent.
Searchers found his car around noon, parked near a gliding airstrip in
Glenfeshie, six miles south-east of Kingussie.
Police believe Mr MacDonald intended to climb both 3338ft Mulloch Clach a
Bhlair and 3658ft Sgor Gaoith, which has 1500ft rocky crags towering above Glen
Einich.
Last night, as winds in driving rain gusted to gale force, a police spokesman
voiced his concerns for the missing man's safety.
Inspector Colin MacKintosh, who is co-ordinating the search from Aviemore
police station, said: ``The prospect of having someone out in this weather for
a second night is obviously a great source of worry.
``We never give up hope in cases like this. If he has dug in, then there is
still a chance that we could find him safe and well.''

ROSS, Cromarty, and Skye MP Charles Kennedy is to continue pressing Scottish
Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton for an independent inquiry into the
affairs of the financially troubled Highland Communities NHS Trust.
Mr Kennedy, who is awaiting a date to meet Lord James to discuss the trust,
also warned the Minister yesterday against endorsing any recovery plan for the
trust which involved the closure of a ward at Inverness's main geriatric
hospital.
In August, the trust discovered it faced a #1.8m deficit, #1m of which had been
due to a failure in budget negotiations with Highland Health Board.
In October, its then chief executive St John Hattersley unveiled a #1.3m
recovery plan including the shedding of 45 jobs. Consideration was also to be
given to the closure of one geriatric ward at Inverness's Royal Northern
Infirmary.
Mr Hattersley resigned earlier this month when medical staff passed a vote of
no confidence in him.
Mr Kennedy visited the RNI and met trust officials and board members yesterday.
He said afterwards he thought the trust management would now support his call
for a full inquiry.
Trust chairman Donald Mackay, however, claims otherwise. ``I am not backing a
call for an independent inquiry because the trust board has not yet debated the
matter. If it decides that an inquiry is the best way forward then obviously we
would co-operate in one.''

IRISH boxer Stephen McCoy, disabled in the Kegworth air disaster, was awarded
record damages of #1,425,000 in the High Court in London yesterday.
The 23-year-old former amateur middleweight boxer in Northern Ireland was 16
when the Boeing 737 London to Belfast shuttle crashed on the M1 motorway near
Kegworth, Leicestershire.
Mr McCoy was left brain damaged and partly paralysed by the crash in 1989 which
claimed 47 lives.
He is now confined to a wheelchair and communicates through a light writer
computer. He will never work again.
His mother Rose, his father Idris, and sister Yvonne, 26, who now look after
Stephen at their home in Toomebridge, County Antrim, were in court to hear the
settlement.
The court was told how Miss McCoy, a trained care assistant, gave up work to
care for her brother.
Mr John Melville-Williams, Mr McCoy's counsel, told the judge: ``Her devotion
and care shines out. She is a heroine.''
Mr Justice Gage said he had no hesitation in approving the ``fair and proper''
settlement. It is the largest payout to any victim of the Kegworth crash and
said to be a record award to a Northern Ireland person in a British court.
He paid tribute to Mr McCoy, who he said had ``faced terrible injuries with
courage and determination'' and commended the ``tremendous work'' of his family.
His sister is to get #15,000 and and his mother #20,000 of the award for their
past care for Mr McCoy.
Miss McCoy said later: ``I would rather have Stephen the way he was than any
amount of money. You cannot put a price on what he's lost.
``I have done nothing but care for him. It is Stephen who has suffered.''
The damages are to be paid by the airline British Midland and the engine
manufacturers and suppliers, who admitted liability.

aMR MONTGOMERY says he did not defend opencast mining (November 14) and adds
that his council had established a good working relationship with the opencast
coal industry.
I have no doubt that the industry would be only too anxious to agree.
Anyone travelling around Ayrshire, looking at the sites that have been
devastated, will know at once who benefits most from this working relationship.
His claim of 500 jobs created is not convincing at the cost of such
despoliation.
The Government, he says, has decided any future for coal lies in opencast. How
far down will it go? What is to happen to the resource below the level the
opencast operators want to go? Have the councils not a responsibility to point
out to the Government the huge loss of resources using the methods of opencast?
Proper protection of the environment was abandoned by the Government in favour
of the ``quick buck'' for the coal masters.
Having spent over 48 years in the mining industry, and as a member of the Clyde
and Avon Valleys Project, I am only too familiar with both sides of the
equation. I have always been an advocate of initiative, enterprise, and
development, but not at any price.
I am fully aware that counsel at public inquiries dismiss emotive objections as
irrelevant. For that reason my objection in our particular case is based on
facts.
If this development is allowed to go ahead one more part of our heritage will
disappear. Our concern is that we had hoped that paid officials and councillors
would bend every effort to help us.
As council tax payers we are entitled to expect our councils and officials will
at least put up a fight to protect our resources and the environment.

HUNDREDS of mourners gathered in heavy rain yesterday to see murder victim
David Ungi finally laid to rest, more than six months after he was killed in a
gangland-style ambush.
The 36-year-old father-of-three was cut down in a hail of automatic weapon fire
after being attacked as he drove his car through Toxteth in Liverpool on May 1.
His killers, believed to be hiding in Jamaica, are still being hunted by police.
A fleet of 31 black stretch-limousines drove to within 50 yards of the scene of
the murder which had provoked a summer of tension and sporadic gang violence in
inner Liverpool.
Up to 1000 people gathered outside Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in Toxteth
to see the cortege arrive from Mr Ungi's home in nearby Aigburth.
Two hearses laden with flowers and one carrying Mr Ungi's coffin led the long
procession. Behind the official cars was a flat-bed lorry carrying a mass of
floral tributes.
Mr Ungi's brothers Ronnie, Joey, Ian, and Tony, helped carry his carved
mahogany coffin into the church for the Requiem Mass.
Two of his brothers, Colin, 30, and Brian 25, remained in custody at Walton
Prison, where they are being held on attempted murder charges following a
shooting incident eight days after Mr Ungi's murder.
Another absentee was his uncle Brian Fitzgibbon, who was facing Liverpool City
magistrates yesterday after being arrested in a drugs swoop in the city on
Friday.
At the service, Father Tony O'Brien said the family's grief had been heightened
by the tragic way he had died and the long delay in holding the funeral.
``Our final hope is that those who committed this crime will be speedily
brought to justice through the proper channels to bring back a sense of
normality to your lives and to this local community,'' he said.
The funeral had been anxiously awaited by the local community amid fears that
it might be the catalyst for further trouble.
Police maintained a discreet presence during the funeral, one of the largest
seen in the city, and journalists were firmly advised that their presence was
not welcomed by the family.
All rest days were cancelled in Merseyside Police force as large numbers of
officers were held in reserve in case of problems and the force helicopter
monitored events from the air.
As the mourners headed for a wake at a Toxteth social club, with a reputed
#12,000 behind the bar, officers were maintaining their vigilance and hoping
that the night would pass as peacefully as the day.

YOUR editorial reinforces views which I have held for some time regarding the
development of golf in Scotland (November 17).
We have in Scotland several famous golf courses which have made us the mecca of
the golfing world and which have in the past been played and enjoyed by
thousands of Scottish golfers from all walks of life.
These courses are part of Scotland's heritage and despite ever increasing green
fees, which in some cases have risen to very high levels, thousands of Scottish
golfers have only been too pleased to meet the cost of playing the likes of
Turnberry, Gleneagles, and St Andrews as a special occasion in their golfing
year.
To these famous courses must now be added the new Loch Lomond club, a
beautifully spectacular course magnificently situated on the banks of the
famous loch.
There has arisen, however, a disturbing trend in the ownership and conditions
of play on these courses which will make them accessible to a very select few.
To play on Turnberry and Gleneagles one must not only be able to meet the
astronomical green fees charged but one also has to be a guest at the hotels
which own these courses.
As far as the Loch Lomond course is concerned, this is now owned by an American
group and the conditions of membership are such as to ensure that only the
exceedingly rich American and Japanese tourist and very few others will ever
enjoy this beautiful Scottish golf course.
It is a great pity that no attempt has been made to keep our Scottish golfing
heritage in Scottish hands, accessible to all and not just a select few.

TWO Scots Guards were convicted of murdering a Belfast teenager after a witness
lied, three Appeal Court judges were told yesterday.
The claim was made by a defence counsel on the opening day of an appeal by
James Fisher, 28, from Ayrshire, and Mark Wright, 22, from Arbroath. They were
convicted at Belfast Crown Court last February of murdering 18-year-old Mr
Peter McBride in September 1992, and sentenced to life imprisonment.
Mr McBride, an unmarried father-of-two, was shot in the back as he fled from a
four-man patrol in the republican New Lodge area of the city.
The soldiers admitted opening fire but denied murder.
They claimed they thought Mr McBride had a ``coffee jar'' bomb in a plastic bag
he was carrying.
But the trial judge, Lord Justice Basil Kelly, now retired, rejected their
claims. He said Fisher had deliberately lied and Wright's claim of self-defence
was ``even more frail''.
Mr Peter Smith QC, for Fisher, said the main issue was whether Mr McBride was
searched before he ``sped off like a greyhound''.
Mr Smith said prosecution witnesses had given evidence that Mr McBride was
thoroughly searched, but the evidence of one witness, John McMullan, could not
be relied upon.
He had made two statements to police saying he heard the soldiers shouting at
Mr McBride to halt.
He later changed his account to say he heard a soldier shout: ``Shoot the
bastard''.
Mr Smith said: ``The introduction of that prejudicial evidence shows that the
witness was prepared to tell a lie to make things worse for the soldiers.
``He was lying in a way that was intended to do damage to the soldiers and that
ought to have been recognised by the trial judge.''
Instead, he said, the judge had described the witness as ``unwavering and
impressive in his evidence''.
The Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, Sir Brian Hutton, is hearing the
appeal along with Lord Justice Carswell and Mr Justice McCollum.
The hearing is expected to last a week.

THE outrageous behaviour of the Nigerian military dictatorship in executing Ken
Saro-Wiwa and eight other defenders of the Ogoni people after a seriously
flawed trial is an unwelcome reminder of the fragile relationship between human
rights and political interests.
Flying in the face of international protests, the Nigerian regime ignored
appeals for clemency and chose instead to exercise the ultimate in political
control by carrying out a death sentence on public figures whose only crime was
the defence of a region and its people.
Amnesty International has repeatedly called for the release of Mr Saro-Wiwa,
believing him to be a prisoner of conscience, but these pleas have been ignored
by this intransigent regime.
This appalling act of violence is undoubtedly a setback for human rights
activists in this country and across the world, but it further underlines the
need to continue the fight to prevent such atrocities.
We may not have been able to make a difference in the case of the Nigerian
activists but there are still many individuals in prisons across the globe who
face similar, if less public, fates if we do not intercede on their behalf.

AS a lifelong trade unionist I must admit to a sense of disappointment in what
Jimmy Reid had to say. He lays into Tony Blair on a whole range of issues and
adds, for good measure, a recommendation that the trade unions should look for
new allies.
Jimmy Reid should take a look at what has happened to the Labour movement
during the past 12 months. It has been a revelation. Whatever view is taken
about the need for re-writing Clause Four, members of the Labour Party turned
out in larger numbers than ever before to discuss it, party membership has
increased substantially, the recent party conference generated greater interest
and enthusiasm than ever before, and there can be no doubt that the Tory
conference was haunted by . . . Tony Blair!
This sort of knowledge should surely have produced different thoughts in Jimmy
Reid's mind. For example, how do those of us who are socialists approach those
men and women who've joined the Labour Party, or feel more strongly supportive
of Labour, and have become so due to the efforts of Tony Blair and the other
leaders of the Labour Party?
It certainly wasn't the campaigning of the old left. They were conspicuous by
their absense. Jimmy Reid should think again.

LIBYAN explanations over their arms shipments and funding for the IRA have

However, the Foreign Office said it remained committed to the United Nations
sanctions on Libya because the regime had failed to comply with UN resolutions
following the Lockerbie bombing.
In particular, Libya had failed to hand over the men suspected of planting the
bomb on the PanAm flight which exploded over Lockerbie and led to 270 deaths in
December 1988.
The suspects are wanted for trial either in Scotland or the US.
Colonel Gaddafi's regime was a main source of weapons for the IRA, sending
Semtex explosives, rifles, pistols, ammunition, detonators, and timing devices.
Libya also sent millions of pounds to support the IRA.
Britain had sent Libya five sets of questions over its links with the IRA in a
bid to ensure that the connection was severed.
In a statement yesterday, the Foreign Office said there remained gaps in the
information over IRA links.
``But when the Libyan disclosures are considered in their entirety, we are
satisfied that they have largely met our expectations,'' a spokesman added.
``We acknowledge that the Libyan readiness to answer our questions is a
positive step towards its implementation of the relevant (UN) Security Council
resolutions, in particular towards its renunciation of terrorism, a path which
we hope it will continue to follow.''

<TEXT>
A BUSINESSMAN who spent #40,000 on a personalised licence plate was told
yesterday: ``You can't put it on your car.''
Mr Niall Walker, a father-of-two from East Kilbride, bought the plate N1 ALL
for his three-year-old metallic-black Calibra Turbo on Sunday.
Yesterday, however, Mr Walker was told by DVLA officials that it was against
the law to put a new registration plate on an older car.
Now Mr Walker, 38, will have to trade in his old model for a new #23,445
Calibra Turbo - which does not, like his present vehicle, have leather seats.
He also plans to buy his wife a new car, because her registration plate M1 OWN,
for which he paid #4500, cannot legally be used on her three-year-old Nissan
100NX sports car.
``I didn't realise when I bought the plates that we wouldn't be able to use
them on our current car,'' said Mr Walker, who owns Walker Engineering in
Motherwell.
``Now we can just about scrape the money together for two new cars.''
Nevertheless, the future may not be too bleak for Mr and Mrs Walker. The
Vauxhall car company is said to be thinking of offering him a special deal on a
new model.
Mr Walker said his wife Katrina had been considering a switch to a four-wheel
drive vehicle to allow her to transport their dog.
Asked what his staff and management team felt about his predicament, Mr Walker
said: ``Their comments go from being out of my skull to understanding the
investment potential.
``Clients have called and said that for a conservative chap like myself it was
a bit out of character.
``The best reaction I've had is from my mum. She called me at 8.30am to say
she'd seen the papers - I spent years hating my name because it was so
unusual.''
A DVLA spokesman said: ``The rule is you can't make your car look any newer
than it is, in other words you can't put a new plate on an old car.
``Mr Walker has 12 months to assign it to a vehicle. But if, after 11 months he
decides to wait longer, he can pay #25 for a certificate to retain the plate
for a further 12 months.''

YOUR critic was absolutely on the mark about Macbeth (November 14). It really
was fairly awful.
But what was even more awful was the programme. Only semi-literate, it was
chock-full of errors that only a simple, or untrained, mind could swallow. I
take but one example: ``The arrival of the Puritan King James in Elizabethan
England was obviously the inspiration for Shakespeare's only Scottish play.''
It was, but James was rather less puritan than Elizabeth (vide his relations
with the Scots Kirk, with the Pope, etc. His wife, Anne of Denmark, became a
Catholic in 1600, before he went south.
``To an author such as Shakespeare - with his cornucopia of gods, goddesses,
fairies, angels, and earth spirits - James's fear and persecution of the
supernatural must have been worrying.''
I can't find any gods and goddesses in the canon except a brief appearance of
Diana in Pericles, Jupiter in Cymbeline, and (perhaps) Iris in Tempest. Are
there any angels at all? The gods are all, significantly, in the late,
Jacobean, plays.
Far from Jamie the Saxt being afraid of the supernatural - and his experiences
with the nasty ladies of North Berwick did not endear witches to him - the
author of Demonologie showed a passionate, and largely objective, interest in
manifestations of the supernatural: a subject which Dover Wilson (in What
Happens in Hamlet) demonstrated to be the hot topic of dinner table
conversation in the period.
Indeed, Shakespeare was - far from bravely attacking his new monarch -
providing just the kind of thing that he, and the Jacobeans, relished. After
Shakespeare nearly all playwrights tried to keep up with the Inigo Joneses and
offer gods, goddesses, angels, and such like in masques and supernatural
transformation scenes.
To suggest that Hecate - universally accepted as a late emendation by Middleton
or A N Other - was even in the play which James would have seen about 1606, let
alone central to its praxis, is dim-witted, feminist, politically (briefly)
correct meandering of the most wearisome kind.
Wouldn't it be nice to see a Shakespeare play performed on a well-lit stage by
well-spoken actors (in whatever kind of dress: it doesn't matter) so that the
author can speak to us, as he has done for nearly 400 years, and let us make up
our own minds about what he has to say?

Women's wicked wit has inspired actress Fidelis Morgan in her latest project.
But then so has a personal loathing of most of humanity which, as she explains
to Julia Langdon, is utterly and completely normal
FIDELIS Morgan was born in a gipsy caravan in the same Wiltshire orchard as the
legendary Queen Guinevere was said to have died. She is an actress and a writer
and a painter. Her bedroom is black with a red ceiling with gold knobs on and
her living room is a cross between lime green and apple green and is said to
necessitate the wearing of sunglasses on the dullest day. As you approach the
front door of her terraced house you will find a painting of her face staring
out angrily from behind painted purple curtains on either side of the porch. It
is intended to remind door-to-door salesmen and evangelists that she is the
woman who always tells them to - well, go away. She claims to hate 97% of the
human race.
``I think,'' said Morgan, ``I'm utterly and completely normal.'' We have only
just met, but within minutes we are discussing the nature of normality.
Everyone thinks they are normal, don't they? says Morgan. Her parents lived in
this caravan with no running water or anything like that because they had
nowhere else to live. She acknowledges that she supposes her mother with those
long dark ringlets was a beatnik, and that they were both hippies before flower
children had been thought of and really are both quite eccentric - ``but they
thought they were awfully normal''.
And then she tells me about her bedroom and her house which has been described
as a cross between Psycho and Phantom of the Opera and I think: Is she trying
to create an effect because she fears being dull, or bored, or ``normal'',
whatever that is? She looks normal enough, dressed in her customary black and
white. She has a mass of curly black hair, bright eyes; she is alert, instantly
charming with her vibrant verbal imagery, but also unexpectedly challenging.
Almost every sentence she utters contains a suprise or a statement of the
outrageous and we keep nearly having arguments about enormously profound
subjects like the role of the Roman Catholic church in peasant societies, or
crime, or Jane Austen. It is refreshing rather in the fashion of a cold shower:
it makes a change and you know you will feel good afterwards but at the time
you wonder why you're doing it.
I had found her without difficulty in the enormous foyer of the Savoy Hotel
which was throbbing with excitable foreign businessmen. She was reading the
court report of the Rosemary West trial in a newspaper and people-watching at
the same time. She is fascinated by crime - ``I'm obsessed with it really. All
great drama and literature is about it: people behaving badly towards other
people'' - very observant about the world around her and professes terror of
boredom.
It is her horror in life. She would ``go nuts'' on holiday on a beach. Couldn't
she read a book? She hasn't been able to read a novel since she wrote one last
year. Although she sits erect, with the dignity of an actor, she still manages
instantly to convey the impression of someone who is always doing three things
at once; indeed she describes herself as a one-woman Blue Peter, and she is
obviously up to something all the time: the intellectual equivalent of doing
clever things with old yoghurt pots.
We are meeting because she has just edited an anthology of Wicked Women's Wit
and Humour. It is a brilliant selection, wonderfully funny, and we will get
round to that in a moment - but there are some other yoghurt pots and cardboard
loo rolls that I should mention.
She has just seen the paperback publication of her novel, My Dark Rosaleen,
about a little boy in the Spanish Armada who is coming to liberate England from
the horrible Protestants. It is a political history of Ireland, she says, very
much in favour of the Irish and not of the Brits. It made one well-known woman
broadcaster want to bomb London, she announces with some satisfaction.
Then she expresses regret that Philip II of Spain didn't better us in 1588 so
we could have been a Catholic country because Catholic countries are so much
more arty. This is entirely a cultural point; she is an atheist. ``If you go to
Italy or France or Ireland, it's thought macho for men to read poetry and sing.
Here it's only macho to go around murdering and having B.O.''
She has just made an episode of As Time Goes By, the Judi Dench series. She is
meant to be doing a radio recording of a short story, The Actress and The
Thief, but needs to get over a bit of bronchitis first; it's ``a little
criminal story'' that she wrote herself.
In partnership with another actor, Jill Benedict - ``that's Jill with a J,''
she says; she is quite endearingly bossy - she has produced an hour-long show
based on Wicked which they are performing around the country. Fidelis spent ten
years with Glasgow's Citizens' Theatre and they have just done the show in
Glasgow and Edinburgh.
But the pair of them are also collaborating on television and film scripts:
they have recently finished a modern-day thriller and a historical drama, also
based on crime, set at Versailles. They are preparing a radio series about a
gossip columnist set in 1700. Did I know that the first daily newspaper, the
Daily Courant, started in 1702 and was edited by a woman?
She has just been on some project at the Central School of Speech and Drama.
This arises from a discussion about her detestation of most of mankind. ``I
think everybody is awful. I hate everybody really. I'm a terrible
misanthrope.'' I murmur something about intolerance. ``I am intolerant!'' she
exclaims. As she said, she dislikes 97% of men and 97 per cent of women. She
has ``enough'' very good friends. She lived with a man once, years ago, but
never again. She can't imagine how, or why, anyone would do it. People say you
have to compromise. Why? She doesn't want to compromise.
She embarks upon a recitation of her dislike of people who claim to know
everything when they know nothing. There was a time when people would admit to
knowing nothing about nuclear physics - but now everyone knows everything. Yet
the country's education system is at an all-time low and at the Central School,
she found students who couldn't even pronounce words like ``compass'' and
``deluge'', let alone spell them.
She admits, a bit reluctantly, sheepish almost, that she probably enjoys choler
(and spells it for me, just in case). It does get her out of bed in the
morning. More specifically, she uses the Kilroy programme, which she
particularly despises because she feels the participants demonstrate their own
ignorance and a cult, or pack, mentality that she loathes. ``It makes me get
up. You can't just listen to it. You have to leap up and dive at the TV to turn
it off and I shout at them, at the voices of all these morons. It's like a
curry - when you've eaten a curry, you know about it.''
If she had nothing else to do once out of bed, she would probably build a new
conservatory, or something of that nature. She can never risk boredom. She
wanted to be a painter first and she should have stuck to that, really, she
says. ``You can't get up and say: `Today I'll play Hedda Gabbler.' But you can
get up and write.''
The anthology of women's wit was proposed to her by the publishers. She was
tentative about the idea initially. The one thing I loathe most in the world is
shelves marked `Humour'.'' She looked at them when she was doing her initial
research and confirmed her suspicion that they were mostly filled with nasty,
dull, offensive books.
She likes wit and cleverness and she has put together a book, based largely on
things to be found on her own shelves. There is much real humour and sheer
delight in it. There were one or two authors she was obliged to put in - she
won't say who - because they are fashionable, but otherwise it is a collection
which is funny and sharp and perceptive and tart. Just like Morgan, really. Or
to quote one of her own favourite wits, Mae West: ``She's the kind of girl who
climbed the ladder of success, wrong by wrong.''

J BOOCOCK's letter on Nigeria begs the question: what is the campaign (November
15)?
Having worked in Nigeria between 1993 and May this year, I long ago reached the
conclusion that the problems that face the country are the result of the people
and the government, and not oil majors, foreign governments, or any other
outside factor.
While all the aforementioned certainly influence a nation's situation, how is
it that Malaysia, Brunei, and Oman are not in the same state as Nigeria?
The main factors causing poor Nigeria's problems are corruption at every level,
tribal differences both locally and nationally, and a very strong north-south
divide.
Chief Abiole and the Ogoni tribe are from the south, where all the oil is and
where the people work hard to get it out of the ground.
The majority of federal government officials, be they dictators or not, come
from the north, and have sat back for years and let the profits from the south
roll their way.
So what is Mr Boocock's campaign? It smells a bit like trying to climb on board
the somewhat shaky Greenpeace wagon, but does it need any more passengers that
can provide only scanty overviews, at best, or misinformed opinion at worst?
If we are to boycott Shell or whoever for what is basically a tribal feud,
should we stop paying taxes or accepting pensions, family allowances, etc, from
the Government for the same reason?

THE 305 workers who were sacked last Friday by Lewis Offshore Ltd when they
implemented an overtime ban will decide this morning on whether or not to
return to work. This followed a three-hour meeting with the management last
night.
After the meeting, the workersmade no comment as they left.
However, Mr Peter Webster, the managing director, said he was optimistic but
declined to give any details of the discussions, except to say: ``I hope the
men will return to work.''
Mr Bruce Crabtree, the regional representative of the GMB, said: ``The workers'
committee felt that it would not be appropriate to make any statement until we
put matters before the mass meeting tomorrow morning.'
Earlier in the day, Mr Calum Macdonald, the MP for the Western Isles, met with
the committee and then with management. He said afterwards that Lewis Offshore
had ``agreed that their demands for no pay rise until April next year and the
new working agreements would be withdrawn, as well as the dismissal notices
issued last Friday.
The men implemented the overtime ban because they have been seeking
negotiations on higher wages.
Mr John Naan, spokesman for the workers, said they were already #1 per hour
below other fabrication yards in the country.
Management said the ban on overtime was illegal because no ballot had taken
place.
Mr Crabtree said after the mass meeting yesterday afternoon: ``We are now going
to meet the company and ask for a reinstatement for all the workforce on the
original terms and conditions. We have to get what is on offer in writing and
it will be put to the workforce tomorrow morning .''
He added: ``People are upset about what is happening. My aim is to ensure the
future of the yard at Arnish and negotiate a reasonable wage increase as soon
as possible.''

IT SEEMS downright ungrateful that the man who cleansed Poland of communist
domination should be defeated in a presidential election by an ex-communist
sports minister. As Poland digests the implications of the narrow victory of
Alexander Kwasniewski of the Left Democratic Alliance (SLD), it is certain that
President Lech Walesa will be unable to regard the result in anything other
than bitterly personal terms. Yet it is that inability to consider Poland and
all issues connected with her governance in any manner other than the intensely
personal which has constituted a wide and dangerous fault-line in that most
unusual of presidents. His past achievements are considerable and cannot be
forgotten. For an obscure electrician from Gdansk to stand up to Poland's
communist machine and to defeat it eventually, thereby guiding the country
towards democracy, was a remarkable feat of courage and persistence. There were
many figures around Lech Walesa at that time, most of whom can hardly bear to
speak to him now, but in the difficult years they constituted a brave band of
reformers with Walesa clearly established as leader. Yet it is evident in
retrospect that Lech Walesa, although tailormade for the struggle against
communist domination, was a man for whom struggle became a way of life. This
suited opposition but in government it became a source of irritation and
eventually of division and bitterness.
In that sad fact lies the seed of Walesa's electoral defeat. President Walesa
governed unwisely, fought with those who should have been his allies, and came
dangerously close to being regarded as a dictator-in-the-making. That sort of
charge hurt him but did not change his behaviour or his policies. Towards the
end of his term as President he became markedly erratic, flirting with the idea
of establishing his own political party along lines laid down in the mid
thirties by that notable extremist and Polish head of state Marshal Jozef
Pilsudski. His capacity for saying the wrong thing continued throughout the
latest election campaign; alarmingly last month, when, in reference to coming
industrial strikes, he spoke darkly of the need for strong measures to suppress
the strikes, saying that he would carry them out for the good of the nation.
Walesa's disputatious nature and the tendency of his former allies on the
centre-right to spend most of their time assaulting each other allowed the SLD
under Alexander Kwasniewski to present a balanced and statesmanlike image. The
former communists were helped by the fact that Poland's many young voters could
not remember the hard times under communism. The only hard times they could
recall were those under Walesa, whose insistence on tough free-market reforms
left many victims in its wake. The Polish economy has prospered despite the
arguments among the politicians, but as the second round of the presidential
vote took place it became evident that Kwasniewski and the SLD would present
little if any threat to the reforms, but displayed instead a calm and balanced
manner which was in stark contrast to the vicious bickering between Walesa and
the centre-right. Poland will not lose through this vote. There is every
likelihood that Kwasniewski will be a reasonable President and that he will not
allow any lingering vestiges of communist ideology to get in the way of
Poland's economic success. Whether Lech Walesa will learn any useful lessons
from his defeat is less likely. To be of continuing service to his country he
must realise that he is responsible for many of the divisions in Polish
society. His most useful act would be to try to find ways of healing those
rifts and of helping others to form a coherent, disciplined, and democratic
opposition.

<HEADLINE>Codes protect paedophiles as Asia's sex tourism establishes itself in Eastern Europe Internet is spreading child porn</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>1</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975274258</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
PAEDOPHILES exchanging information about child abuse on the Internet are using
complex codes to avoid detection.
A system called PGP, which stands for ``pretty good privacy'', allows them to
create coding systems which would take the best computers in America 10 years
to crack.
Detective Chief Inspector Barry Drew, head of the National Criminal
Intelligence Service paedophile intelligence section, said yesterday: ``Some
people are sending porn down the Internet together with the instructions as to
how to use encryption to safeguard yourself. You need to know the key to
unscramble it. It's being used more and more extensively for all sorts of
things.''
He said it was not difficult to find someone on the Internet willing to
demonstrate how to use the system to create your own code.
He was speaking at the start of an international conference in London bringing
together police officers from around the world to discuss ways of preventing
child sex abuse.
The conference will address the growing problem of paedophiles travelling
abroad to abuse young children sexually. It will hear reports from countries
which suffer most, such as Thailand, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines.
Mr Drew said there was evidence that countries in Eastern Europe and elsewhere
were becoming destinations for sex tourism as the countries with a more
established problem tightened up on abuse.
``Paedophiles are no respecters of geographic boundaries, often networking
across Europe and beyond to exchange information and experiences with
like-minded individuals,'' said Mr Drew.
``There is a need for co-operation on an international scale within the law
enforcement community and this will be a major theme of our conference.
``The NCIS paedophile intelligence section maintains a database of over 3000
names of people known to us for paedophile offences. We make that information
as widely available as possible both in this country and abroad to those in law
enforcement who can take action.''
Operation Starburst, the first large international operation against
paedophiles using the Internet, recently saw the arrest of 15 people in Britain
and a number of others in Hong Kong, Germany, South Africa, Singapore, Canada,
and America.
Mr Drew said they had started with 37 suspects but a German mentioned another
40 names worldwide.
It was quite possible that the trail might go right around the world and lead
to further arrests in Britain, he added.
Mr Drew said his officers had about 10 operations on the go at any time, many
of them working with one or more countries.
``We have operations at the moment targeting UK paedophiles travelling abroad,
importing child pornography in all its forms, and dealing with the transmission
and distribution of child pornography,'' he said.
He estimated that Western Europe accounted for about 10% of the men travelling
to Asia to have sex with children and said the number from Britain was not very
large.

A SUPPORT centre for carers was opened officially by the Princess Royal in
Dundee yesterday.
The centre will provide information and respite services to the city's 17,000
carers after a refurbishment.
The Princess Royal Trust for Carers is to manage the centre, which has been
funded by British Telecom, Tayside Regional Council, and Tayside Health Board.
The princess praised volunteers at the centre for their efforts to solve
problems faced by carers.
She said: ``Dundee has taken a lead in improving awareness of a group who need
other people to understand and support them.
``We owe a great debt of gratitude to those who support carers and make an
effort to solve their problems.''
Mr Bill Furness, BT's national manager for Scotland, said: ``The carers centre
will be invaluable to the one in seven people in the city who are carers.
``It will provide resources which would otherwise be beyond the reach of small
charity groups.''
More than 1500 carers are expected to call at the centre, where staff and
volunteers provide a sympathetic ear and practical help with laundry, shopping,
and transport.
The Princess Royal Trust for Carers has received #2m worth of national
sponsorship from BT's community affairs programe.
The princess ducked questions from reporters about the Princess of Wales's
appearance on Panorama.
She carried on walking to her Land Rover Discovery vehicle before she drove
away.
Farther north, Princess Margaret visited Fraserburgh to open Scotland's
National Lighthouse Museum.

ARTHUR Scargill has a point. We do need a Socialist Labour Party, otherwise
there will be no real alternative to the Tories - particularly since Tony Blair
has made it clear to the CBI and media barons like Rupert Murdoch that new
Labour is committed to their interests.
In doing so Blair may win office but he won't win power. After all, big
business will still be in charge, running the economy and dictating terms to
trade unionists and the unemployed, which we saw under Callaghan.
Scargill, of course, has been dismissed as a crank and extremist by Labour's
public school boys. Predictable stuff, that's for sure.
But over 100 years ago another miner argued the case for a Socialist Labour
Party. He also suffered abuse from the press and leading lights in the trade
unions.
His name? James Keir Hardie, who, by the way, advocated public ownership and
home rule for Scotland. No wonder Kinnock and Blair did not support my Commons
Early Day Motion recognising this fact when it was tabled in 1988.

RAYMOND ROBERTSON, the Scottish Office Minister responsible for education,
struck a conciliatory note yesterday when he warned against the use of public
examination results alone to draw conclusions about the performance of schools.
He echoed the health warning in this year's exams report that Standard Grade
and Higher data should be used to raise questions about schooling. Results did
not tell the full story. They were one pointer - albeit a very important one -
to what made a good school. The Minister's remarks were a far cry from those
made by Michael Forsyth after the first batch of exam results in 1992. The then
Education Minister sought to encourage the politics of envy when he highlighted
the poor results of one West of Scotland secondary whose per-pupil costs were
particularly high. If Mr Forsyth's hope was to encourage magnet secondaries
with good results but a significantly smaller spend on their pupils to opt out,
it turned out to be pious.
Three years on, opting out remains a side issue. Not so the publication of exam
results. Mr Robertson believes that the debate is no longer about how to stop
publication of results but about what to put in them, and how the findings
should be used. He has a point. Helen Liddell, who speaks for Labour on
Scottish education, confirmed her party's commitment to give parents as much
information as possible, but in a way which takes social and economic factors
into account. The Tories will not countenance this, but where the two parties
appear to share common ground is on the value-added issue. Our secondary
schools already receive tables from the Scottish Office which allows them to
measure the value they add to the educational experience of their pupils by
using their performance in Standard Grade to predict how they should do in
their Highers, and comparing that with how they actually do. Comparisons are
made by grouping pupils on the basis of their attainment at Standard Grade, so
like can be compared with like. Strathclyde region further refines value-added
by using clothing grant to group schools according to their catchments.
The Government is committed to finding a value-added measure which can go along
with exam results to give a fuller and fairer picture of how schools are doing.
Mr Robertson says he is prepared to bide his time until his officials and local
authority education officers get it right. That is welcome. But is it
essential? There is an argument that the annual exam results event is a
nine-day wonder which does not interest parents much and disappears after a
brief flurry of publicity. If results are to be nationally published, however,
the answer has to be yes. Scotland, it appears, is as far ahead as any country
in the world in measuring value-added on the basis of relative performance in
fourth and fifth years.
One of the challenges facing the Scottish Office and local authorities is to
find a way to measure the effectiveness of schools on pupils from the day they
walk through the gates aged five until they enter fourth year. Another
challenge is to look beyond attainment. Schools should be, and are, about much
more than exam results. A wide-ranging research project is under way to measure
ethos - the things which schools do to make pupils and teachers happy and
effective. But perhaps the biggest challenge is to put all this in a way which
is accessible to, and interests, parents. Meanwhile schools which struggle
against the odds attract bad publicity because of poor results. And as a result
their very ethos suffers.

WHEN a company is the subject of a takeover bid it is vitally important that
information about that company is reported accurately. Your reporter's story on
Jebsen's bid for Altnacraig Shipping was misleading and inaccurate.
Lack of knowledge of the shipping industry (not ``shipbuilding'' as your
heading had it) might excuse the writer's description of Altnacraig's ships as
``ageing''. None of our four ships is more than 19 years old. They are
extremely well maintained and have many good years of service ahead of them.
There are many ships well over 30 years old still in operation today.
The comment that Altnacraig has never paid a dividend is factual but apparently
your reporter was unaware that BES companies rarely, if ever, pay a dividend to
their shareholders during the five-year BES period (even the highly successful
Fergusons shipyard, which made a profit of #1.5m last year, paid no dividends
to its shareholders in the BES period).
However, the categoric statement that Altnacraig has made a loss ever since its
foundation is wrong. Altnacraig made satisfactory profits during its first two
years of operation - in fact over #1m. How else would we have been able to
raise over #2m in our last public BES issue in 1990? After that we were hit by
the recession in Western Europe, where we largely trade, and, like other
companies in the dry bulk carrier market, suffered from the fact that too many
ships were chasing too few cargoes.
With industrial activity beginning to pick up, Altnacraig is again trading
profitably and is not, as your reporter would have it, a ``financially troubled
company . . . with a question mark over how long it could continue to trade''.
Your reporter goes on to predict that Altnacraig shareholders ``will only
receive a fraction of their ill-starred investment''. What foresight enables
him to tell us at what value the Jebsen shares will trade when it is listed on
NASDAQ or other stock market? My wife and I, who are the second largest
Altnacraig investors next to Jebsen's interest, certainly hope and fully
anticipate that the Jebsen shares, which we have irrevocably undertaken to
accept (rather than cash), will trade at a level which will give us
considerably more than our initial investments.
Finally, I should add that, while it is true, as your reporter said, that
trading on NASDAQ in New York is expensive for small investors, he should know
that Jebsen has undertaken to ``make arrangements to facilitate in dealing in
parcels of shares on behalf of former shareholders so as to improve the
liquidity of the stock''.

THE Prime Minister and Irish Premier John Bruton could meet for a new bid to
break the peace process deadlock before the end of the week, it emerged last
night.
Senior Whitehall sources said the Government was pencilling in Friday as a
possible date for a summit - and laying down no conditions over a venue.
The surprise news came as London awaited a formal response from Dublin on a
series of proposals put forward by Mr Major over the weekend.
Mr Bruton, who is anxious to see early movement to all-party talks on Northern
Ireland, is thought likely to respond positively to the suggestion of an early
meeting.
It thought Mr Major and Mr Bruton may be in touch by phone today.
However, sources in Dublin were playing down expectations of a breakthrough in
the impasse which has dogged negotations for weeks.
A Government source in London said: ``We are ready to roll as soon as Mr Bruton
can respond positively to our proposals.
``The first real opportunity for the Prime Minister to be able to do this is
Friday. We are targeting the end of the week if at all possible and the Irish
know this.
``It is hard to read at the moment, but if we are getting any signals out of
Dublin, it is that that they too would like to do the same.''
The last summit, set for Chequers in early September, was postponed at the last
minute by Dublin after Sinn Fein raised objections to plans being drawn up by
the two governments.
Mr Bruton yesterday consulted senior Cabinet colleagues and officials about the
Downing Street suggestions.
Significantly, he also called in Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and SDLP leader
John Hume for private discussions. Neither was thought to have been told the
full details of Mr Major's blueprint.
However sources close to the Taoiseach warned that the Major proposals were
unlikely to prompt a peace process breakthrough - a signal that potentially
serious differences had still to be overcome between the two leaders.
The difficulties centre on continuing British insistence that the IRA must move
to decommission arms ahead of the entry of Sinn Fein into all-party talks.
Downing Street made it clear that London was seeking a courageous approach by
Mr Bruton towards advancing the peace process. Officials said ``the ball is now
in Dublin's court'' and looked forward to the early re-activation of the summit
timetable.

HAT pathetic creatures those Unionist politicians, Robertson, Carlaw, and
Maclennan, show themselves to be in their comments on documents they have never
seen - the Scottish National Party's budget for the first four years of
independence.
Scottish taxpayers have subsidised other parts of the UK for generations, ie,
taxation spent in Scotland has been far short of a fair share of what has been
raised in Scotland.
This has been shown to be the case time and again since the 1940s. When the
SNP's opponents have the courage and honesty to comment objectively on the
SNP's proposals in detail, they will earn far more respect than they are due
for the drivel you publish from them (November 14).

WHEN schoolboy Steven McGregor first came to the occupational therapy
department at Edinburgh's Royal Hospital for Sick Children he was labelled
``backward'', with no academic future.
Yesterday, however, the 13-year-old came to the rescue of the therapists when
he sat down at the department's computer, which was refusing to do its stuff
for staff, and solved the problem in minutes.
His success was no surprise to the therapy team, who had chosen him to front
their contribution to National Paediatric Occupational Therapy Day and now call
him their ``whiz kid''.
They have worked with him since he was seven when, after years of arguing with
doctors and teachers that he was anything but backward, Steven's mother, Mrs
Mary McGregor, eventually succeeded in having him referred to a specialist at
the Edinburgh hospital.
Her son was diagnosed as suffering from dyspraxia, a development co-ordination
disorder which affected his ability to perform basic tasks such as writing and
drawing, dressing himself, and using a knife and fork, and made him a target
for playground bullies in his early days at primary school.
Therapists quickly recognised that the boy had an aptitude for working on
computers, which they developed, helping him build up his self-confidence to
the stage where he has overcome his co-ordination problems and only visits the
department once a week - to help other youngsters.
Now in third year at high school, he still has problems with writing, but
produces his written work on a lap-top and has set himself the target of
studying computer programming or physics at university.
Mrs McGregor said: ``The change in him has been enormous. From being a quiet,
shy, and bullied introvert, he is now a happy, contented, and confident young
man.''
Mrs McGregor now plans to help therapists set up a support group for the
parents of other children with similar difficulties.
She said: ``I knew all along that Steven wasn't stupid. One of his problems was
that he couldn't get things down on paper and teachers and others automatically
assumed he was stupid.
``I tried for four years to get someone to recognise that he had a problem. One
doctor told me I was neurotic.''
Ms Catherine McDerment, head of the occupational therapy department at the Sick
Children's Hospital, said that dyspraxia was now becoming more widely
recognised and that the number of referrals to her department had grown
consistently over the past 10 years.
``I am sure that there are still many children who haven't been diagnosed,''
she said.

THERE can be no doubt that the collation and publication of examination
re-sults has been a vital tool in the drive to establish some sort of quality
control over secondary schools. The bald figures, however, are more useful to
those ``in the know'' than they are to the lay person.
They have been used quite properly by, for example, education directorates to
point up performance problems and put pressure on under-achieving pupils and
even - with more detailed internal statistics - departments. But they are open
to abuse by naive parents who might not understand the implications of such raw
statistics and can, therefore, easily end up misplacing their children.
Many parents still old enough to have been at school in the old senior
high/junior secondary days may suppose that a certain extra quality lingers on.
Sadly, this is all too often completely untrue.
Able pupils who are keen to succeed may well do so despite their adverse
corcumstances at school. This has bred a laziness among staff, finding
themselves in a no-lose situation - successful pupils proving how good the
school is, with the failures not being ``up to it''.
The presumptions linger on and old senior high schools are only now being
called to account as the league tables show performances well below their
upgraded neighbours - and no excuses!
Conversely, many upgraded junior secondary schools have succeeded in making
many a sow's ear at least pass for a silk purse. The tradition of staff having
to work hard to push their pupils through any exam has lingered on in the
``ethos'' (vogue word!) of the school.
Staff frustrated by working with the rebellious and disaffected are so
delighted by the odd good class that they work twice as hard with it and
significant numbers of pupils achieve more than they might reasonably have
expected if there had been just one more nameless person in the class at a
``better'' school.
It is hard to discover this from the tables as there is a huge variation
between schools which were upgraded. In some, the overwhelming majority of
pupils still have no interest in education, so the crude results may seem poor.
Here the crucial question is: ``Can you succeed if you want to?'' In others,
the school has changed out of all recognition and now competes on any basis -
including the raw figures.
Class is an all-too-relevant consideration in choice of school - however
regrettable that may be, especially in ideologues. In a poor area there is a
danger of those who would wish to work hard being bullied as ``sooks'' and
anyone unwilling to stand on a street corner all night being branded a ``snob''.
Here the crucial question is: ``Who controls the playground?'' In a large
school, even in an anti-educational catchment area, there may be enough willing
pupils for them to form a clique of their own and therefore to survive
relatively unscathed, while in a smaller school the pressure to conform with
gang-defined norms may well be insuperable.
Conversely, many an able pupil from a poor background feels very uncomfortable
if moved to other than the ``local'' school. How should an ambitious youngster
on an assisted place, for example, react when his friends are universally
dismissed by his classmates as ``Kevins'' and ``Sharons''?
Where should his loyalties lie? What is his social and home life going to be
like if by travelling across town he rarely sees his old friends, cannot afford
to travel to socialise with new school friends and would be embarrassed to ask
new friends home? The supposed ``hot-house'' atmosphere may well result in
wilting rather than flourishing.
Moves to establish ``added value'' tables may give a more fair idea of how well
a school is performing in terms of its overall ``efficiency'' - but, where
published holistically, they are likely to be of little greater value to the
outsider.
The raw figures as currently published appear to imply the assumption that
``intelligence'' - whatever that may be - is distributed evenly between all
schools. The concept of added value depends on the idea that tests of
intelligence (eg, Verbal Reasoning Quotent - VRQ) or Reading (typically the
Edinburgh Reading Test - ERT) are reliable indicators of likely degrees of
success at Standard and Higher Grade, etc.
Thus any pupil can have his/her actual scores compared with what might have
been expected from VRQ or ERT and the difference (good or bad!) is attributed
to the school. Of course there are actually many other factors, and so the
school may be irrelevant.
The problem (apart from the assumption of ``reliability'') is that variations
from this supposed norm may vary depending on intelligence. Thus a school might
get its poor pupils to over-achieve while more able pupils under-score - or
vice-versa. Depending on the proportions of these pupils, so the overall
``value added'' total will vary. Similarly, this arrangement will ``average''
scores across subjects, masking differences between strong and weak departments.
What should parents do? The supposed purpose of publishing these tables is to
allow parents to make an informed choice of school. Pupils, however, are highly
individual and one school will destroy one pupil but allow another to flourish,
while the next school might have the exactly inverse effect.
I would start by having my child's IQ assessed independently and by asking
him/her about all the qualities he/she wanted in a school. Armed with the exam
and truancy tables, I would then go and inspect the school I was considering,
seeking an explanation of the statistical variations between that and
neighbouring schools.
I would try to find a current or immediately past pupil of similar academic
standard and outlook as my child and ask him/her - confidentially - to dish the
dirt. Then, together, my child and I would make our decision.
What should parents NOT do?
l Don't worry about the decor - or whether or not there's a pool. Enthusiastic
staff will more than compensate for all that. But do check for enthusiasm - and
competence!).
l Don't pay too much attention to your contemporaries who remember the school
as it was a generation ago, except with specific regard to staff who may still
be there. Overall, it doesn't take long for big  differences to emerge.
l Don't pay much heed to these tables. Whatever the generalisation, it probably
won't apply to your child. You need the sort of information no tables like this
could ever deliver.
l Don't be scared to admit your mistake. If things aren't going right, the end
of second year is a good time to move - the end of first year even better.

The pair called separately at the pensioner's home in Oswald Road on Friday.
The woman - aged between 25 and 35 - offered to help the old lady in her home
but she was turned away. Minutes later, the boy, thought to be 10, called
asking for a bag to help him catch a missing cat. While the old lady was in her
kitchen, it is believed the boy stole the cash and jewellery.

Geraldine Abrahams records formal recognition for two customised management
training programmes
WHILE some types of training may be generic to most sectors of industry and
commerce, there are areas which need a particular focus, which demand
programmes designed specifically to meet individual needs.
In the past week, two customised management training programmes which were
carried out in two very different industry sectors - manufacturing and
education - have been formally recognised.
Though quite differently targeted and delivered, they embrace a shared belief
that professional and personal development are vital for effective management.
Last Thursday, Endeavour Scotland, the independent training organisation and
registered charity, together with Japanese printer manufacturer OKI (UK) Ltd of
Cumbernauld, celebrated the joint presentation of a Scottish Training Award for
their Leadership Development Programme at the Scottish Training Awards ceremony
in Glasgow.
In the eight years that OKI (UK) Ltd has been located at Cumbernauld, it has
built a strong workforce of 700 employees as well as a formidable reputation
for quality. A recognised Investor In People, OKI also won the 1994 Quality
Scotland for Business Excellence.
For a company like this, producing 400,000 printers a year, the well-being of
the workforce is paramount and the search for a quality environment is
continuous.
In 1993, OKI looked at its future expansion plans and realised there would be a
growing need for supervisory staff - team leaders - if the workforce was to
continue operating effectively. And, rather than bring in people from outside,
the company decided to ``grow' new leaders from within the existing workforce
through an extensive training programme.
It picked out the best of its senior operators, and put them through a one-day
introduction which included a process of self-evaluation based on Management
Charter Initiative personal competencies.
Once selected, the participants were involved in various on-and off-site
exercises designed to explore the key themes of leadership, team-working, and
the development of a learning culture.
They examined the theoretical aspects of leadership like motivation,
communication, assertiveness, dealing with conflict, and carrying out reviews.
There was also a self-managed, community-based project - something that OKI
considered to be a very important part of the whole programme, according to
personnel manager Martin McCrindle, who explained:
``The company generally has a policy of being a good corporate citizen and
likes to be involved in the local community; but the reason for building in a
community-based exercise to the programme was more to do with personal
development.
``The experience of getting involved with people who are more disadvantaged,
relatively speaking, brings out the kind of values we look for in our team
leaders.''
The Leadership Development Programme culminated in a group presentation to
senior management who have been delighted with the progress of those involved.
``We have a fantastic team of team-leaders emerging as a result of this
programme,'' said Martin McCrindle. ``We were trying to provide a model for
communication and leadership, and those on the programme are a fine example to
the other people within the company, especially those within their own areas of
work.
``They have come through this with a remarkable sense of trust, with high
integrity and motivation, and are equipped with a set of values that are
important to this company. Apart from the development of personal potential,
the Programme has generated a higher quality and increased output.
``We feel there is a place for skill-based management training but the personal
aspects of leading teams can be neglected - though these can be the critical
factors in motivating the team.
``This programme was a departure from skills and technique, looking instead at
individual values. Our challenge now is deliver this further throughout the
company.''

A SCOTS nannie caught up in a suspected assassination plot in Cambodia has been
freed from house arrest.
However the Foreign Office said last night that Ms Janet McDonnell, 35, from
Kilmarnock, was staying on to look after the three children in her care.
She has celebrated her freedom from house arrest by taking the family dog for a
walk, protected by a detective.
Ms McDonnell, an experienced nannie and former matron at Edinburgh Academy, was
trapped in a Phnom Penh villa on Friday.
Her employer, Prince Norodom Sirivudh, a former foreign minister and prominent
critic of the government, was placed under house arrest accused of attempting
to assassinate the country's co-premier, Huns Sen.
Caught up in the intrigue were household employees, the prince's three
children, and Ms McDonnell, who went to Cambodia a year ago to look after them.
The children's mother is out of the country.
Earlier there were fears that contact with Ms McDonnell had been lost after
lines to the house where she and her charges were staying appeared to be cut.
However a Foreign Office spokesman said that British Embassy officials had been
in contact with her, and with the Cambodian Government.
``Both have assured us she is well. She is not unduly alarmed by the situation,
and she has been allowed to leave if she wishes.
``But she is reluctant to leave the country because she is the nannie, and the
children's mother has not yet returned.''
Ms McDonnell's twin brother, Michael, who lives in Kilmarnock, said last night:
``This is very good news and a weight off our shoulders.
``I will be even happier when I speak to her direct, which I hope to do
tomorrow.''

Athens, Monday
GREEK Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou was in hospital with pneumonia tonight.
Papandreou, 76, was rushed to hospital today suffering from breathing problems.
He had open-heart surgery in London seven years ago and has since appeared
frail.
It was not known how long Papandreou would stay at the Onassis Heart Hospital,
where he was in intensive care.
A hospital spokesman said the infection in Papandreou's left lung was not
serious.
Papandreou, whose socialist party Pasok won elections in 1993, was not hooked
up to any special machines and his heart and kidneys were functioning normally.
Government officials said earlier that Papandreou was suffering from flu and
was being treated at home.
A team of seven lung and heart doctors, including his personal physician, held
emergency talks to decide on treatment.
His son, Education Minister George Papandreou, visited his bedside and told
reporters: ``His condition is under control. All is well.''
Before he went to hospital, Papandreou had been due to face a group of
dissident socialist MPs who were expected to call again for a full debate on
the increasingly powerful role of his wife, Dimitra Liani, 40, who is also his
chief of staff.
She controls all access to him, sets his daily agenda, and accompanies him on
every occasion. She was at his side when he was raced to hospital.-Reuter.

WHILE some types of training may be generic to most sectors of industry and
commerce, there are areas which need a particular focus, which demand
programmes designed specifically to meet individual needs.
In the past week, two customised management training programmes which were
carried out in two very different industry sectors - manufacturing and
education - have been formally recognised.
Though quite differently targeted and delivered, they embrace a shared belief
that professional and personal development are vital for effective management.
Last Thursday, Endeavour Scotland, the independent training organisation and
registered charity, together with Japanese printer manufacturer OKI (UK) Ltd of
Cumbernauld, celebrated the joint presentation of a Scottish Training Award for
their Leadership Development Programme at the Scottish Training Awards ceremony
in Glasgow.
In the eight years that OKI (UK) Ltd has been located at Cumbernauld, it has
built a strong workforce of 700 employees as well as a formidable reputation
for quality. A recognised Investor In People, OKI also won the 1994 Quality
Scotland for Business Excellence.
For a company like this, producing 400,000 printers a year, the well-being of
the workforce is paramount and the search for a quality environment is
continuous.
In 1993, OKI looked at its future expansion plans and realised there would be a
growing need for supervisory staff - team leaders - if the workforce was to
continue operating effectively. And, rather than bring in people from outside,
the company decided to ``grow' new leaders from within the existing workforce
through an extensive training programme.
It picked out the best of its senior operators, and put them through a one-day
introduction which included a process of self-evaluation based on Management
Charter Initiative personal competencies.
Once selected, the participants were involved in various on-and off-site
exercises designed to explore the key themes of leadership, team-working, and
the development of a learning culture.
They examined the theoretical aspects of leadership like motivation,
communication, assertiveness, dealing with conflict, and carrying out reviews.
There was also a self-managed, community-based project - something that OKI
considered to be a very important part of the whole programme, according to
personnel manager Martin McCrindle, who explained:
``The company generally has a policy of being a good corporate citizen and
likes to be involved in the local community; but the reason for building in a
community-based exercise to the programme was more to do with personal
development.
``The experience of getting involved with people who are more disadvantaged,
relatively speaking, brings out the kind of values we look for in our team
leaders.''
The Leadership Development Programme culminated in a group presentation to
senior management who have been delighted with the progress of those involved.
``We have a fantastic team of team-leaders emerging as a result of this
programme,'' said Martin McCrindle. ``We were trying to provide a model for
communication and leadership, and those on the programme are a fine example to
the other people within the company, especially those within their own areas of
work.
``They have come through this with a remarkable sense of trust, with high
integrity and motivation, and are equipped with a set of values that are
important to this company. Apart from the development of personal potential,
the Programme has generated a higher quality and increased output.
``We feel there is a place for skill-based management training but the personal
aspects of leading teams can be neglected - though these can be the critical
factors in motivating the team.
``This programme was a departure from skills and technique, looking instead at
individual values. Our challenge now is deliver this further throughout the
company.''
LILLIAN Cameron and Rob Wallen of Aberdeen College have been awarded STAMP
(Scottish Training and Accreditation for Management Programme) Certificates in
Management by Glasgow Caledonian University - the first of the 200 people from
various areas of further education who are working towards the award.
The STAMP programme was developed by SFEU (Scottish Further Education Unit) in
1992 in response to a growing need for educationalists in further education
colleges to be equipped with management skills needed when they became
free-standing bodies in 1993.
SFEU had been set up one year earlier to offer support and advice to further
education providers in Scotland. The unit looked at various existing management
initiatives, including the Management Charter Initiative, before deciding to go
down the route of CEMP, an educationally-based management initiative devised in
Cheshire, refining it for use in a Scottish educational environment.
STAMP involves the recognition and analysis of ``Abilities' in relation to the
management of learning provision and services, and it requires the development
of portfolio evidence, covering all the key areas of management, to
substantiate this.
Apart from the obvious attractions of a competence/work-based programme, it
also offers its participants accreditation through a higher institution.
Like the programme at OKI, there was a strong emphasis on personal as well as
professional development and, as such, the programme has a natural affinity
with Investors in People.
Rob Wallen, joint recipient with Lillian Cameron of the first STAMP
Certificates of Management last Wednesday, and head of Quality Assurance at
Aberdeen College, found that he could incorporate the training programme into
his everyday work.
``Within STAMP, I didn't collect special evidence to put away in a box. All my
work went into filing cabinets. Since the evidence was - and still is - part of
my everyday work, that is where it belongs,'' he said. ``Although I am aware of
the Abilities, I do not go out of my way to meet them - that just happens.
``Putting  my portfolio together meant looking at the Abilities criteria and
selecting appropriate evidence from my files.''
Before she took up her job as an SVQ development officer at Aberdeen College,
Lillian had already completed some management training and had been in a
management position, but she had never analysed her own management abilities in
detail.
``STAMP has provided me with a way of evidencing that I am doing my job
properly and increased my awareness and appreciation of the work of others,''
she said. ``It has helped me to work hard at developing an open and honest
approach.''
According to Colin Sinclair of SFEU, at this time of immense change for those
in further education, the demand for management skills is greater than ever. He
said that freeing colleges to run themselves had taken the sector into a much
more competitive environment. ``We see effective management becoming
increasingly important in the business world which education has now entered,''
he said.

<HEADLINE>Three former president's men quit in sign of Poland's political fall-out Walesa vows to fight on after defeat</HEADLINE>

FORMER shipyard rebel Lech Walesa suffered a bitter defeat in presidential
elections at the hands of ex-Communist Aleksander Kwasniewski but promptly
vowed today to rally a united opposition and recoup power.
``I still have a lot of energy . . . and the tango will start for real now,''
said Walesa, who as founder of the Solidarity trade union did more than any to
rid Poland of communist domination in the 1980s.
``There will be a single electoral platform, we will win everything back in
short time,'' said Walesa, setting his sights on parliamentary elections due by
1997.
He said that after a week's rest at his home in Gdansk he would gather
supporters and start travelling Poland.
``Let's not disperse, let's not abandon our hopes, let's not dissipate our
strength, Poland needs us,'' he said in a message to a staff crushed by his
defeat.
Kwasniewski, who campaigned on a Western-style social democratic platform,
appeared on television moments after official results were announced. He
pledged loyalty to market reforms and said Poles could rely on him to continue
the push for Nato and European Union membership.
``I want to assure everyone that Poland will not depart from the path of
reforms,'' he said, in remarks clearly calculated for foreign as well as
domestic consumption.
The head of the electoral commission announced in mid-evening that Kwasniewski
had won 51.7% of the vote, while Walesa received 48.3%.
The deeply fractured political centre and right descended from Solidarity
desperately needs some unity if it is to stand a chance in parliamentary
elections.
Walesa emerged from the presidential campaign as by far the strongest figure of
the centre-right camp, but there is scepticism about his political future.
Bronislaw Geremek, father figure of the Union for Freedom (UW) opposition
centre party, doubted whether Walesa was the man to bring the parties together.
``I don't know if it can unite, or unite around the loser in this campaign,''
Geremek said.
The constant conflict between Walesa and the SLD government, the vetoing of
Bills and delayed legislation, may have contributed to his defeat.
Kwasniewski, 41, has pledged reconciliation, saying all political camps should
participate in Poland's future.
However, in a first reverbation of Walesa's defeat, the three ministers of
defence, foreign affairs, and the interior, who owed their posts to him,
resolved to resign.
Walesa, with his trademark moustache and fiery oratory, became a symbol of
resistance to communist rule when he founded the Soviet Bloc's first free trade
union at a Gdansk shipyard in 1980. In 1981 he was jailed in a communist
crackdown.
Walesa based his presidential campaign on invoking the crimes and errors of the
communist past, but voting trends suggested many had put the battle with
communism behind them.-Reuter.
