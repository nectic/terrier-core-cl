Stephen McGinty explains how Edinburgh was put to the French test and
did tres bon.
OF THE French we were taught at school little now remains. Un petit
peu to be exact. The Auld Alliance between France and Scotland never
really ran to the exchange of languages. Like phone numbers they are
often easily forgotten. But what is remarkable is the distance that
memory cells will stretch to reach back and tug out a few vital words
lost among blackboard chalk and school ties.
August has arrived in a blaze of sunshine and this month sees
Edinburgh host five festivals -- count them: International Festival,
Fringe, Film, Television, and Book -- the tourist trail is a clutter of
European backpacks, deck shoes, and striped Benetton jumpers.
Every year Edinburgh attracts more than 2.2 million tourists, with
more than 55,000 arriving from France. But in the anniversary year of
the Auld Alliance, just how willing are we to help our foreign pals? The
French deliver a short-shift to those who arrive in their domain
unwilling to even attempt the briefest of conversations. Are we just as
guilty?
The difference, of course, being that the French in many cases can
understand but choose not to. But would we have the necessary building
blocks to help accommodate a needy tourist? To ask the question do the
Scots speak French may seem stupid -- they speak Scottish or English or
whatever -- but the answer is surprising.
It's un petit peu.
The Scottish office via the department of Trade and Industry has been
encouraging businesses to brush up on language skills. To discover if
they have been hitting the books hard, The Herald enlisted Isabelle
Vitale, 23, a psychology graduate from Universite Lyon II, currently
working in Edinburgh, to put them through their paces.
Posing as a French tourist, she first explained in English that she
did not have a good grasp of the English language, before proceeding to
ask assistance in French. In tribute to the Eurovision Song Contest each
hotel, restaurant or shop was awarded points out of cinque. The results
make surprisingly cheery reading:
HOTELS
The Balmoral, Princes Street.
NIL points. At perhaps Edinburgh's most exclusive hotel mademoiselle
was passed from pillar to post, from receptionist to the reservations
office with others in between. While Isabelle desired information on the
price of the room, Balmoral staff wanted to know when she wanted to
stay. ''August, September, or October?'' Despite a lengthy delay no-one
could be found to translate. They did, however, manage two French words,
a friendly farewell, ''au revoir!''
Caledonian, Princes Street
TROIS points. With sheer effort and persistence, Caledonian staff took
to chipping away at the language barrier. The first receptionist was
never rude, simply distracted, as she tried to track down someone with a
little French knowledge. Number two tripped over his tongue, but
third-time lucky Isabelle struck a girl who's school French coaxed her
slowly through room prices and availability.
Capital Moat House, Clermiston Road
QUARTRE points. Striking linguistic gold first time round, the
receptionist at the Capital Moat House, although no native, worked,
joked, laughed, and finally communicated her ideas. ''She was very
helpful, she tried very hard. You could tell it wasn't easy. But you
didn't feel like a fool.'' says Isabelle.
TOURISM INFORMATION
CINQUE sur cinque. ''Parlez vous Francais?'' Were the first words out
of the receptionist's mouth after Isabelle's false, stuttering
confession that she couldn't speak English. The girl was in fact French,
and so explained bus tours, timetables and prices to perfection.
RAIL
British Rail Information
TROIS points. A slow start quickly developed into an uphill battle as
the lady on the other end of the line struggled to remember the French
she had forgotten. A process of elimination narrowed down the train
times and finally Isabelle hung up with the required information.
BUS
Scottish CityLink Coaches
DEUX points. Razor-wit dropped Scottish CityLink's points total by one
when after Isabelle explained: ''I don't speak English'', the staff
member said: ''you just did''. Accurate, but unfair, it left her feeling
irritated and uncomfortable, but she was quickly rescued by his
colleague who had lived in Switzerland for a time, and was able to
answer any questions.
RESTAURANTS
Pierre Victoire, 10 Edinburgh Road.
CINQUE sur cinque. Surely those accents were too thick to be genuine!
Henderson's Salad Table, 94 Hanover Street.
DEUX points. A male/female double-act managed to book a table for
Isabelle but for what night, nobody knows. Such was the mental confusion
which was around Edinburgh's most famous vegetarian restaurant. ''Il
s'appelle, Je m'appelle, vous s'appelle,'' was the mantra chanted by our
man as he struggled to get a name for the booking. Nice try, though!
SHOPS
Boots, St James Centre
NIL points. Like an Israeli pop song, Boots just couldn't deliver. A
simple inquiry about insect spray descended into a rude farce. When
asked if there was anyone who could help, the saleswoman said: ''No,
nobody, thanks, 'bye.''
Jenners, Princes Street
DEUX points. At Edinburgh's oldest department store a lady laughed
down the phone when asked if she spoke French. ''No, I don't speak
French,'' she briskly replied: ''What do you want?'' After a minute she
understood the word ''kilt'', transferred Isabelle to the necessary
department when a young man played verbal table-tennis with his
colleagues to piece together the colour and price Isabelle wanted.
ARTS
Festival Office
QUARTRE points. The International Festival earned its name not only by
its variety of productions, but by the assistance guests are offered. In
perfect French Isabelle's native productions were described and the girl
spent time explaining the time, venue, and location, before graciously
accepting Isabelle's compliments.
Fringe Office:
TROIS points. An apology from the first person meant being passed to
the second who shouted round the office: ''Is there anybody who speaks
French here, What! No-one? You're kidding! No-one speaks French here?''
The noise must have woken up one girl who passed her higher French and
so saved the day.
THE VERDICT
AT the end of an afternoon's delightful deception Isabelle said:
''Since I have been in the country everybody has been so helpful, but
then, I have been speaking in English. I didn't expect everyone to be so
kind. I expected more scorn. More of: 'You don't speak English, we don't
speak French. 'Bye!' ''
In gratitude we decided to call the Scottish Office to praise
Edinburgh's helpful public. We were put on hold, while they fetched a
French speaker. We're still waiting.
Nil points!

Ros Davidson looks back at the remarkable musical journey of a man who
became an icon for several generations of fans.
JERRY Garcia, the free-spirited guitarist who led the Grateful Dead
for decades, died in his sleep near San Francisco on Wednesday after a
long struggle with heroin. A rock legend and icon of the 60s, he was
known for an all-American blend of bluegrass, folk, rhythm and blues,
and rock.
Grateful Dead attracted fans as diverse as Vice-President Al Gore, who
invited Garcia to the White House, and LSD guru Ken Kesey.
Garcia had turned 53 about a week before his death, of heart failure,
at a drug treatment centre in Forest Knolls in Marin County. Band
manager Dennis McNally said: ''He packed a lot of living into those 30
years with the band. His body just couldn't keep up.''
The portly, grizzled musician had entered the clinic two days earlier.
He had fought addiction for years.
His death is not only the end of an era, it is also rocking the
California rag-tag hippie band's vast web of businesses, which range
from some $50m in ticket sales yearly to a line of Jerry Garcia ties in
posh department stores.
''He really had no equal,'' lamented Bob Dylan.
As the news spread in San Francisco on Thursday, fans gathered in the
streets to console each other. Some Deadheads, as they are known, wore
trademark tie-dye clothing with black arm-bands. Others were in business
suits.
The Internet was so flooded with eulogies that warnings were issued
that part of it might crash.
At City Hall, Mayor Frank Jordan, wearing a Garcia tie, ordered flags
flown at half-mast.
By evening hundreds of fans gathered in Golden Gate Park. Dead songs
-- Uncle John's Band, Ripple and Touch of Grey -- were played as they
danced in circles around a shrine of candles and pictures of Garcia,
amid the scent of marijuana. At dusk, a fan named Rusty Jones led the
crowd in Amazing Grace on the bagpipes.
Garcia's bespectacled, bearded, benevolent face had long symbolised
the carefree flower power of Woodstock, both for ageing baby boomers and
young fans faced with a world of cynicism.
The Grateful Dead has been one of the most successful touring bands
ever in North America. In 1993, no other group topped its ticket sales.
Within the music business they exemplified integrity. Outside, they were
known for promoting communal bliss at concerts and keeping prices low.
Deadheads would follow Garcia and his troupe for thousands of miles in
colourful buses and vans, attending every stop on a tour.
Each performance differed, it is said, with free-form music that could
last for hours.
Garcia also worked independently, with Jefferson Airplane and Crosby,
Stills, Nash and Young.
His latest album was children's music, Not For the Kids Only, released
in 1993. He is survived by his third wife, Deborah Koons Garcia, and
four daughters, Heather, Annabelle, Teresa and Keelin.

WESTMINSTER Health Care has nursed its shares back to near full
recovery after last February's missing rights issue which sent the stock
tumbling 38p to 293p.
At the time of the interim figures, the market had expected a funding
call of about #45m. That arrived yesterday in a slightly smaller version
with the full-year figures which showed a pre-tax profits incrase of 23%
to #13.8m on turnover 38% greater at #69.5m. The dividend total has been
raised 20% to 5.4p with a 3.3p final.

<HEADLINE>Registrar will have to decipher signatures and count votes manually. ScottishPower blunder withproxy forms for Manweb bid</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISHPOWER, backed by leading City solicitor Freshfields and
merchant bank Baring Brothers, has made an astonishing blunder in the
issue of proxy forms to its 570,000 shareholders, who are being asked to
approve its #1000m bid for Manweb.
As proxy forms began to drop through letter-boxes, it was discovered
that they did not contain a pre-printed name and address for the
particular shareholder or any bar-coded information which would allow
ScottishPower's registrar, the Bank of Scotland, to trace them to a
shareholding on the register.
The only means of tracing them back, unless shareholders print their
names and addresses of their own volition, will be through
identification of the signatures on the forms.
However, in spite of the embarrassing blunder, it appears that
ScottishPower does not intend to re-print and re-mail the proxy forms.
An official for ScottishPower, which yesterday enjoyed a 10p leap in
its share price to 341p, said last night: ''There is no question of the
validity or legality of the proxy forms.''
ScottishPower, which is thought to have taken legal advice after the
blunder was discovered, guaranteed that all shareholders who returned
their forms with only a signature would be traced.
Proxy forms in respect of ordinary resolutions at an extraordinary
meeting, such as those relating to ScottishPower's Manweb bid, must be
issued either 14 or 21 days in advance, depending on the particular
business.
With the meeting in Glasgow scheduled for September 4, the
Glasgow-based utility would, at best, have had little more than one week
to re-print and re-issue the forms.
Given the amount of time which Freshfields and Baring Brothers will be
devoting to the Manweb bid, it seems astonishing that the omission was
not picked up. ScottishPower will be paying the bulk of the #32m of
expenses associated with the Manweb bid to City advisers.
Bank of Scotland is faced with the time-consuming task of deciphering
signatures in tallying up proxy votes. With bar-coded data having been
omitted, votes will have to be counted manually.
One shareholder said: ''If they can't organise an EGM, what makes them
think they can organise the affairs of Manweb Plc.''
He said that, in the past, ScottishPower proxy forms had always been
adequate, including bar-coded data or some way of tying a shareholding
to a particular form.
However, Baring Brothers director Dan Clague claimed the proxy form
for the forthcoming extraordinary meeting was ''absolutely fine''.
He added: ''It is a standard proxy form. If ScottishPower have a
different proxy form normally, that is something else.''
No-one at Freshfields was available for comment.
ScottishPower has increased its stake in Manweb from 12.5% to 14.4%
during the last two days, with industry sources suggesting this may
reflect the Glasgow company's increasing confidence that its bid will be
successful.
The utility, which mopped up the 12.5% within four days of the July 24
announcement of its hostile bid, had not bought any Manweb shares for
nearly two weeks.
However, on Wednesday, it went back into the market to purchase
another 1.49 million Manweb shares at 890p. It bought a further 570,000
yesterday, taking its total to 15.5 million.
If its bid was to fail, the Glasgow-based utility would be likely to
be left with a sizeable stake worth significantly less than its current
market value because Manweb's share price would be likely to plummet
from its current 894p.
ScottishPower's latest moves to increase its holding would appear to
reflect a growing confidence that its offer will not be brought down by
any regulatory or monopoly hurdles, and will be approved by Manweb
shareholders.
With ScottishPower shares having surged yesterday, the
shares-plus-cash element of its bid for the Chester-based company has
risen from 945p on July 24 to 982p. There is a cash alternative of 915p
per share.

Brussels, Thursday
NATO warplanes over Bosnia may now fire immediately at any
missile-connected radar system directed at them as soon as it is turned
on, alliance sources said today.
''If they start following an aircraft it is deemed a hostile act and
the pilots can respond immediately in self-defence,'' said one source
who asked not to be identified.
''The opponents have been told about it,'' he added.
The sources stressed that the conditions under which Nato warplanes
might open fire had not been altered, they had simply been
reinterpreted.
''The rules of engagement have not changed. What has changed is the
determination of what is hostile intent,'' one source said.
The change followed pressure from countries with aircraft patrolling
over Bosnia. Two Nato jets, a US F16C and a British Sea Harrier, have
been shot down by missiles over Bosnia in little over a year.

GERMAN chemical group Bayer announced yesterday that its first-half
net profit had surged 35.7% and it expected to top its own forecasts for
pre-tax profit in the full year.
Bayer said in its interim report that first-half group net profit
jumped to DM1340m from DM985m a year ago. In the second quarter alone,
pretax profit jumped 37.9% to DM1580m. Bayer, which along with other
chemical groups has benefited hugely from the ending of Germany's
recession, said it was confident for the full 1995 year despite the
setbacks due to the strong mark.

MR Joe Carlin, deputy editor of the Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser,
was protesting too much in his letter (August 1). It was odd that the
letter was not written by the newspaper's current editor; and any
account of the Advertiser's behaviour over the last three years could
only be complete if Mr Graham Isdale, the former editor of the
newspaper, were able to give his account. Where is he now?
Mr Isdale was the chief reporter who gave a television interview
during the Coatbridge and Airdrie by-election in 1982 in which he
promoted the issue of so called ''Catholic'' Coatbridge and
''Protestant'' Airdrie.
Fortunately Tom Clarke was so well-known and respected in both Airdrie
and Coatbridge that such blatant sectarianism did not emerge in that
election and Tom Clarke swept to victory.
Later, however, the Advertiser cannot claim that it was lily-white on
this issue. True, it was careful in its own articles -- even as it
repeated ad nauseam material that had been used before. The repeated
attacks by Ms Eileen MacAuley -- where is she now? -- on John Smith were
quite disgraceful.
Even if the Advertiser might be acquitted of going the full road in
terms of sectarianism in its editorial columns, week after week it
published the most provocative and outrageous letters from people who
were clearly blinkered in their fixed bigoted attitudes.
The deputy editor cannot deny that shorty after Tom Clarke became
Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland the paper published a
frighteningly biased letter which accused Mr Clarke (wrongly, as it
happened) of having a Scottish front-bench team which was entirely
Catholic. A great surprise to Mr Henry McLeish, Mr Gordon McMaster and
others, and plainly untrue!
The fact that the national press and media time after time insulted
the people of Airdrie and Coatbridge by continually referring to
''Protestant'' Airdrie and ''Catholic'' Coatbridge has never been
challenged by the Advertiser, and this was clearly implied by its own
coverage.
The truth is that the whole of this affair was initiated by the
Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser on the very week that John Smith
became Leader of the Labour Party, and the coverage which followed
appealed to some of the worst instincts of our local communities.
The Advertiser cannot now withdraw from its own responsibility towards
creating an appalling situation, reeking with intolerance, in Monklands
and elsewhere.
In the meantime the district council, having been criticised by not
one official body from the auditors to the Accounts Commission to the
police, has to endure yet another inquiry at a time when up and down
Britain outrageous acts are taking place even in councils like
Westminster!
Yet again Monklands has to put up with sheer humiliation when all our
efforts should be towards rebuilding and regenerating an area which has
been devastated by the present Tory Government. Unfounded allegations
are no substitute for fact even if they appear in the (unanswered) Black
Report.
Joe Carlin has been very much involved in one of the blackest episodes
that people have seen in the West of Scotland and if his letter
represents an apology then we are at least making progress.
However, the idea of Mr Carlin washing his hands in the manner of
Pontius Pilate is not at all convincing, unless of course like the
legend of history he is prepared to accept that he sanctioned the
crucifixion as well. The victim this time was Monklands District Council
and the people of Monklands who were ill-served by their local paper.

ANGLO/Dutch publishing group Reed Elsevier is naturally taking a
positive view about the proposed sale, or rather auction, announced last
month, of its book, consumer magazine, and newspaper publishing
businesses. It considers them low margin operations with exposure to
volatile consumer markets.
Reed is to concentrate on expanding its information publishing and
data business and the acquisition of US electronic publisher Lexis-Nexis
in December for #1100m in December was part of this process though it
also increased the company's substantial debt burden.
Reporting half-year profits up 18% to #370m before tax, a shade better
than top projections with Lexis-Nexis contributing a first time #40m,
Reed suggested that it expects to get between #700m and #1200m for its
divestments. Ian Irvine, chairman of the British half of the company,
indicated that the proposals had generated considerable interest.
However, given the wide range between the estimates of the amount that
will be raised, clearly there is still a good deal of hit or miss about
just what a particular business will actually fetch. Reed will be
looking for the highest bidder in all cases though there is an outside
chance that the Dutch newspaper division could be floated on the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange.
Sales prospectuses are expected to be out by the end of the month but
none of the divestments are thought likely to be completed before the
last quarter of 1995.
Each business to be sold has attracted a relatively long list of
interested parties but Reed says it is too early to enter serious
negotiations with any particular potential buyer.
The proposed disposals include Reed Regional Newspapers, the UK's
largest free newspaper publisher, Reed Consumer Books, US magazines, and
the Dutch newspaper group.
Shareholders are rewarded with an increase in the interim dividend.
Reed International, the UK half of the business, is raising the payout
by 12% to 7.5p on a 21% advance in earnings per share to 26.3p.

I AM not in a position to ''tell''
Mr Bashir Maan to do anything; he's here, and welcome to do what he
likes -- and does.
Nevertheless, no-one should be surprised if one of nature's oldest
laws continues to function, viz: ''for every action there is an equal
and opposite reaction'' -- which is why the reaction of Dr J Macgregor,
of Alloa, to my letter anent that of Mr Maan comes as no surprise to me
(August 9).
The words ''racist'' and ''racism'' did not exist prior to the end of
the Second World War according to my copy of the Concise Oxford
Dictionary, usually regarded as authoritative.
No, ''racist'' and ''racism'' were part and parcel of the hand baggage
(maybe intended as a kind of ''body armour''?) of the post-war immigrant
influx and that had been tacked on to our existing vocabulary as a more
evocative way of expressing preference and/or prejudice, good
old-fashioned words that don't however meet the requirements of
''newspeak''.
Dr Macgregor avers that I am ''overtly racist''. Well, in that we all
have our individual preferences and prejudices -- except those like Dr
Macgregor who presumably have none, neither likes nor dislikes -- I
suppose I am what he says I am because that is what he wishes me to be
-- in order to satisfy his own prejudices.
There's nothing like giving a dog a bad name in order to have it
destroyed -- is there?
All that Dr Macgregor knows of me, so far as I am aware, is what he's
gleaned from the odd letter of mine expressing a point of view that The
Herald has thought worth publishing.
I don't know whether the good doctor is MD or PhD but if MD I'd rather
not be one of his patients if he bases diagnosis and prescription on
hearsay rather than looksee!
Probably the happiest two months of my life were spend in midwinter
1940-41 at nearly 8000 feet holed up in a little fort in hostile
territory. The hostiles were only too ready to ''have a go''.
I, the lone European, was together with a bunch of Asiatics, eight
Muslims, and some 75 Hindus, not one of whom would not have given his
life to save mine, however worthless according to Dr Macgregor.
I tell you, sir, I felt a damned sight safer when I was then than I do
today anywhere within a 10-mile radius of Glasgow's Riverview Gardens --
or Alloa!
Notwithstanding the foregoing I have only the friendliest feelings for
Mr Maan and Dr Macgregor, victims of their own particular prejudices of
which I am seemingly and sadly one.

HARAYIR is worth opposing in today's Hungerford Stakes at Newbury.
The filly was a most impressive winner of the 1000 Guineas, bursting
clear at the distance to score readily by a length and a half.
But she was firmly put in her place by Ridgewood Pearl in the Irish
1000 Guineas and the Coronation Stakes, and she appeared below her best
when third of five to Caramba at Newmarket last time out.
Best bet to take advantage is Fraam, who can give Walter Swinburn a
belated thirty-fourth birthday present.
Fraam ran a blinder under 9st 10lb when bidding to repeat last year's
win in the Schweppes Golden Mile Handicap at Goodwood. After coming from
off the pace to lead briefly inside the final furlong, he finished a
close fourth behind Khayrapour to whom he was conceding nearly 2st.
Fraam has a much more straightforward task at the weights this time
and can take full advantage.
Regal Eagle can emulate Lammtarra by making a winning debut in the
Washington Singer Stakes.
Trainer Ian Balding is a good judge of his unraced two-year-olds and
he has landed good prizes first time out with Moccasin Run and Selkirk
in recent years.
The colt receives a 3lb newcomer's allowance, which should be more
than enough in what looks a substandard field.

ITALY have won their first Admiral's Cup after coming from behind to
beat favourites America.
The three-boat Italian team were left celebrating their first overall
victory in yachting's most prestigious offshore trophy after winning two
of the three classes in the gruelling 605-mile Fastnet Race.
The US team had taken a 25-point advantage into the final race of the
two-week regatta, but poor performances from two of their three boats in
the Fastnet contest allowed Italy to claim their first victory since the
Admiral's Cup began in 1957.
Dennis Conner's US America's Cup tactician, Paul Cayard, one of the
crew on Italian yacht Brava Q8, played a major role in achieving victory
as his countrymen struggled in painfully light winds off the south-west
coast of England. Standings:
Big Boat: 1, Group 4 Seahorse (GB); 2, Pinta (Germany); 3, Mean
Machine (Scandinavia).
ILC 40: 1, Brava Q8 (Italy); 2, Pigs in Space (US); 3 Anemos
(Germany).
Mumm 36: 1, Mumm A Mia (Italy); 2, Sansui Sprinter (S Africa); 3,
Corum (Hong Kong).
Final overall standings: 1, Italy 112.958 points; 2, USA 138.250; 3,
Germany 147; 4, Scandinavia 191; 5, South Africa 198.750; 6, Ireland
219.750; 7, Hong Kong 243.50; 8, Great Britain 247.125.

Sid, Serbia, Thursday
THOUSANDS of Serb refugees in old tractors and battered cars, their
windows smashed by stones, poured into Serbia today after running the
gauntlet of hostile Croats.
A trail of buses with broken windscreens and cars with bandaged
drivers crossed into Serbia at a tollbooth marking the border with
Croatia on the road known in the days of old Yugoslavia as ''The Highway
of Brotherhood and Unity''.
The damage and wounds testified to the ferocity of attacks by Croat
civilians on the Serbs as they left a last Serb-held pocket in the
northern Krajina under UN escort.
United Nations officials complained Croatian police did little to halt
the attacks.
The wounded were in the first wave of 5000 to 6000 Krajina Serb
refugees who left their homes yesterday and reached Serbia early this
morning.
Another 50,000 people have made the slow journey through Serb-held
northern Bosnia to Serbia after fleeing Croat forces, who overran rebel
Serb Krajina last weekend.
More than 100,000 were still behind them in Bosnia, caught up in
slow-moving traffic lurching toward the border. UN aid officials said
the tail-end of the flight from Croatia had reached western Bosnia and
they expected few new arrivals.
Thousands were still travelling down the Croatian highway today from
the Krajina under UN supervision. Many of the last to depart were on
tractors. Journalists said there appeared to be fewer attacks against
them.
A 60-year-old Serb academic whose head was swathed in bandages
described the assaults:
''It all started when a soldier punched out my side mirror and then
another smashed my windscreen. Croat civilians then seemed to take the
cue from the soldiers and the rocks started flying,'' he said.
''It was appalling. The Croatian police had the duty to protect these
people but they just looked on as mobs pulled them out of cars and beat
them up. It was quite widespread,'' said UN aid agency spokesman Kris
Janowski.
''I was certain I would never get out of there,'' Ljubica, 55, told
reporters at the Sid border crossing. ''It's good to be here. We can
breathe more easily now.''
As the ethnic hate of victors surfaced in Croatia it was matched in
Serbia and Bosnia by the behaviour of the defeated.
The Croatian Government office in Belgrade reported Krajina Serb
refugees driving Croats from their homes in villages north of the
Serbian capital, where the leading independent radio station broadcast
appeals for tolerance towards non-Serbs.
In the Serb-held town of Banja Luka in Bosnia, Croats and Muslims were
attacked and UN aid spokesman Mans Nyberg said there were reports of
people being physically thrown from their homes and badly beaten.
''Even the sick are being manhandled and put out on the street,'' said
Nyberg.
He said the flow of Croatian Serbs through western Bosnia and on to
Serbia had not yet eased and estimated it would take at least a week
before the roads were cleared of refugees.
''The travellers are very silent and resigned to their fate,'' said
Nyberg. ''They are very determined to go to Yugoslavia. I think it is
the only place they feel secure.''
But UN officials said there were persistent reports that men of
military age were being allowed into Serbia for only three days to
settle their families before being required to report for military duty
with the Bosnian Serb Army (BSA).
Diplomats said Serbia may use refugees to bolster the Serb population
in areas it felt were threatened, such as eastern Slavonia in Croatia,
still Serb-held, and Kosovo, a majority Albanian area in south Serbia
with ambitions to break away.--Reuter

ANDY Goram, the Rangers keeper, will report with the rest of the
Scotland international squad tomorrow as ready as anyone to face Greece
in the European Championship clash at Hampden next week, writes Ken
Gallacher.
Reports of a possible defection from the international set-up had,
clearly, been exaggerated. Yesterday, Scotland team-manager Craig Brown
spoke to Goram and his club manager Walter Smith, and the outcome of
these discussions had an angry Brown clearing the air.
''As far as I'm concerned there was never a suggestion that Andy Goram
no longer wanted to play for his country,'' said Brown. ''All he did do
was point out that the match next week falls between the two preliminary
round European Cup ties Rangers have had to play, and that he was
concerned about the possibility of injury.
''I can understand that. Anyhow, throughout the period Andy has been
out of the team, I have remained in touch with him, mainly through his
goalkeeping coach, Alan Hodgkinson.
''Alan also works with our goalkeepers and so he always knows what is
going on,
''The whole matter has been cleared up. Andy will be with us and he
will be rooming with Jim Leighton as usual.''
I understand that Goram has stressed to Brown his long-term commitment
to his country's cause.
His only concerns have been over the injuries he has suffered playing
for Scotland which have then kept him out of the Rangers side.
Says Brown: ''I can understand the worries Andy may have over the
possibility of injury. But he is not the kind of man who would let that
affect his game. I have made it very plain that I am delighted to have
two class keepers in the squad in Andy and Jim.
''That remains the case and on Tuesday I will have to tell one of them
that he is not playing against Greece. That will not be an easy decision
to make, believe me.''
Leighton has deputised for Goram in the last six Scotland games and
has conceded just a single goal -- a penalty against Ecuador during the
summer trip to Japan.
Next week's Hampden game is crucial to Scotland's hopes of qualifying
for the finals of the European Championships in England next summer. A
victory would place Brown and his players in a powerful position, with
only two home games remaining.

OLIVER McCall yesterday warned Frank Bruno and British boxing: ''Fine
me and I go home.''
The World Boxing Council heavyweight champion is due to appear before
the British Boxing Board of Control disciplinary committee on Monday for
his ''vengeance'' threat to Bruno, whom he fights on September 2 at
Wembley Stadium.
McCall had promised to inflict serious damage on Bruno to get even for
the severe injuries suffered by his close friend Gerald McClellan at the
hands of Nigel Benn.
The American later said there was no ill feeling between himself and
Bruno and yesterday insisted: ''If they fine me one pin, I'm on the
plane.''
Speaking from his training camp in Bedfordshire, McCall stressed: ''I
didn't have to come back to Britain. I beat Lennox Lewis and I'm giving
Bruno the opportunity. I'm giving your country the opportunity to have a
heavyweight champion again. Don't you understand that?
''They can't take my licence, and if I get fined I ain't gonna fight
no more over here, as much as I love it.''

GAVIN Hastings has declined to deny that he is involved with Kerry
Packer's ''rebel'' rugby circus.
There have been persistent rumours that the former Scottish captain
who retired after the World Cup as the most capped Scot of all time, may
have been fulfilling the same liaison role in Scotland as did Francois
Pienaar in South Africa.
The Springbok captain was alleged by World Rugby Corporation
solicitors to have agreed a fee of #187,000 for recruiting the Springbok
squad to a professional, 30-team tournament financed by Packer's media
empire. Pienaar has since denied this.
''I am making no comment,'' said Hastings yesterday. ''I don't want to
get drawn into this. It doesn't concern me, because I am retired from
international rugby. I have no comment to make whatsoever on the WRC.''
Hastings, a sports marketing executive in Edinburgh, would be an ideal
candidate for such a role in Scotland and, perhaps because of this,
those who cast him in the role of recruiting sergeant are adding two and
two and making five.
However, Hastings added: ''After years in the limelight I am trying to
settle down and I am not going to add fuel to the fire by making any
comment on what is going on and that's the end of the matter.''
Earlier this week the Irish squad issued a collective denial that they
had signed up with Packer.
It seems sure that Scottish players have been targeted, and The Herald
understands that this may have been a factor in the recent seismic
Murrayfield announcement that the SRU was keen to embrace a professional
game.
Meanwhile, yesterday's scheduled legal showdown in Cape Town between
WRC and the South African rugby authorities over the future of the World
champion Springbok squad has been postponed until today.
Australian players will soon decide whether their futures lie as
rebels or with the establishment. Around 50 of the country's players met
yesterday to discuss the matter. They will make a collective decision
after further talks.
And in Paris yesterday, French federation chairman Bernard Lapasset,
who will chair the IRFB professionalism meeting later this month,
declared: ''The players will be taken into account in the federation's
financial plans -- but they will certainly not get any money to play.''

DALE Reid took a leaf out of Sam Torrance's book in an effort to cure
her putting woes, but still shot a 76 yesterday in the opening round of
the Woodpecker Welsh Open at St Pierre.
Reid, winner of a Tour record 21 tournaments, has not won for four
years and resorted to using a broom-handled putter in her attempt to
overcome the yips.
However, the experiment failed to pay off for Reid, who was left
trailing nine strokes behind Helen Wadsworth and Wendy Doolan.
They lead by one stroke from four players on 68, including Laura
Davies and Trish Johnson. Julie Forbes was top Scot after a 70.
Wadsworth, out early in the morning, gathered six birdies and an eagle
in her 67. Doolan had been one over after four holes, but birdied five
of her next six before catching Wadsworth with birdies at the long
fourteenth and sixteenth holes. Leading scores:
67 -- H Wadsworth, W Doolan (Australia).
68 -- T Johnson, L Davies, A Arruti (Spain), C Dibnah (Australia).

Torrence crosses line and Ottey is golden girl.
DOUG GILLON In Gothenburg
THE second triple-jump record of the World Athletics Championships
fell last night, and Merlene Ottey became the oldest world champion when
she took the 200 metres -- despite crossing the line second.
It was Britain's world record-breaker, Jon Edwards, who inspired
Inessa Kravets to make the Ullevi stadium the home of the triple jump.
She reached 15.50m in a contest which produced three of the four best
jumps ever.
The Ukrainian produced a picture of Edwards -- given to her by the
British jumper -- and launched herself into the record books. ''That's
what inspired me,'' she said after having improved upon Anna Biryukova's
two-year- Bulgarian Iva Prandzheva reached 15.18m, and Russian Biryukova
was third with 15.08m.
Gwen Torrence crossed the line first in the 200m, with 21.77sec. But
on the curve she took four strides on the line, and was disqualified.
Ottey, timed at 22.12, the same as Irina Privalova, won after scrutiny
of the finish photo. Galina Malchugina was promoted to third.
Ottey, now 35, has won 12 world medals, three of them gold, in every
championships since they began in 1983.
.
''I don't care how -- mine is the gold,'' said the jubilant Ottey.
''That's more important than the car. Gwen is in fantastic shape. She
can break the world record any day.''
But comments from the principals later were less than friendly. ''I
don't believe anyone can really enjoy the medals knowing they were not
winning 'for real','' said Torrence.
Ottey, officially appointed to the post of Jamaica's roving ambassador
two years ago, said bluntly: ''She was cheating so she was disqualified.
''I don't know if she did it purposely. But I heard that she did the
same thing in the semi-finals. She cheated. She ran about two metres
shorter than anybody so she should go.''
The bitterness between Torrence and the Jamaicans is long-standing.
After Torrence won Monday's 100m final, Jamaican Juliet Cuthbert said
she thought the American was crazy.
Torrence retorted: ''A loser never likes a winner, Jamaican don't like
Americans. Period.''
Britain's Denise Lewis launched a controversial barb at Ghada Shouaa,
the Syrian heptathlon winner who amassed 6651pts for her country's first
ever gold.
''She is very interesting to look at,'' said Lewis, who was seventh
with 6299. ''She has an almost manly kind of physique,'' adding that she
also appeared to have hands the size of Bob Weir, Britain's 20st discus
thrower.

SCOTRAIL and Caledonian MacBrayne should smarten up their act at
Gourock railway station and ferry terminal.
While the country basks in a heatwave and tourists and trippers head
for the coast, Gourock station last week offered no toilets or
waiting-room, both facilities being locked, with no explanatory notice.
The station is undergoing renovation at present and the normal
waiting-room is closed for safety reasons but the alternative facilities
were not made available to the travelling public.
At the ferry terminal, things were scarcely better, with inadequate
toilet facilities and all four vending machines marked ''out of order''.
Not a cold drink or a biscuit to be had on a sweltering day. In the
opinion of a group of French tourists, ''Merde''.
Then, the ferry was late arriving from Dunoon ''because of the
increased volume of traffic'', which meant CalMac had been caught on the
hop and was not hosting a convention related to sheep and their human
friends.
On the subject of timetables, the beautiful island of Bute must lose
revenue because of the early departure of the ferry on weekdays -- 7pm
Monday to Thursday at 7.45pm on Friday. Maybe CalMac are promoting a
''keep Rothesay clean'' campaign by encouraging visitors to leave before
the ungodly hour of 10 o'clock when all hell might break loose over a
blackpudding supper.
True, motorists are not obliged to leave by the ferry; they can always
take a wee jaunt over the Rest-and-be-Thankful. It's just that a later
ferry would mean more people on Rothesay and more money being spent.
Makes sense?
Full-colour brochures of what's on in Scotland are all very well but
if tourist chiefs really want to promote the industry, they should
mingle with the travelling public and tackle problems at grassroots
level.
Operators who fail to reach an acceptable standard should be replaced
with those who view tourism as a serious business and not a pin-money
promotion.

A RESOLUTE innings by Mike Atherton, which brought him a century of
great distinction, the eighth in his 50 Tests, gave England the perfect
start in the fourth Test. But by close of play the West Indies hit back,
taking three wickets in a space of 32 runs to reduce England to 227 for
four.
England's opening pair, Atherton and Nick Knight, had provided the
basis of a daunting first-innings total for the first time in the series
after having elected to bat on an excellent wicket at Trent Bridge.
Atherton defied a back injury and declared himself fit to play, which
resulted in stand-by batsman David Byas being sent back to his county,
Yorkshire. England omitted Mark Ilott and Alan Wells from the original
13 in the squad.
On yet another sweltering day of this marvellous summer, England's
opening batsmen thwarted the new-ball attack, from which Curtly Ambrose
was absent with a back injury. The tourists brought in leg-spinner
Rajendra Dhanraj in his place. Their three other changes were Stuart
Williams and Shivnarine Chanderpaul for Carl Hooper and Jimmy Adams,
both injured, with wicketkeeper Junior Murray replaced by Courtney
Browne.
The cricket was sedate as England reached 67 without loss at lunch.
Knight, although slow, showed the concentration that is so vital a
quality in an opening batsman. In spite of being restricted from scoring
freely for long periods, he remained unflustered. His stroke-play
gradually became more fluent and he hit Benjamin stylishly on one knee
to the mid-wicket boundary and then repeated the shot off Dhanraj.
In Benjamin's last over before tea, Knight drove him powerfully
through cover for 4 to bring up his first Test half-century. It had been
a patient knock of nearly four hours and contained five boundaries.
West Indies, at last, got the breakthrough soon after tea, which was
taken on 142 without loss. After driving Dhanraj to the mid-off boundary
in the second over of the final session, Knight finally fell leg before
wicket to Benjamin.
Atherton, meanwhile, continued to play the tourists' attack with
increasing confidence. He forced a bowling change, with Dhanraj being
replaced by Walsh after the England captain had hit the leg-spinner
twice to the mid-wicket boundary in the same over, taking his score to
89.
His unblemished hundred in 280 minutes from 216 balls, and including
15 boundaries, followed two overs later as he turned Benjamin for a
single to the on-side.
Crawley edged fatally off Benjamin, and then Atherton's 336-minute
innings ended when he called for a single of Bishop, only to be beaten
by Dhanraj's direct hit. England still were in charge but Thorpe's
departure for 19 -- defeated by a ball angled across him -- put a
different complexion on the day's events. Scoreboard:

EDINBURGH failed to make the final of the NCA Counties championship
when they were comfortably defeated by Warwickshire at the Grange Club
yesterday.
Roddy Smith made runs at a suitable rate, his 51 out of an opening
stand of 65 requiring a mere 54 balls and included a 6 and eight 4s.
Thereafter the middle order subsided on an unhelpful wicket and their 50
overs yielded 166 for six.
That never looked to be enough and the visitors reached the target
with eight overs in hand as twin brothers Stuart and Gavin Shepherd
shared an unbroken stand of 84.
Edinburgh 166-6 (R Smith 51, A Davies 31no, B Lockie 30; A Bray 3-26);
Warwickshire 168-4 (S Shepherd 97no, G Shepherd 30no).
OTHER SCORES

ALTHOUGH two Americans, Mark O'Meara and Jim Gallagher, yesterday took
the initial honours with scores of 64, seven under par, in the first
round of the US PGA Championship at the Riviera Country Club, Sandy Lyle
and Colin Montgomerie with respective 67 and 68, carried the opening
challenge for a title elusive to Europeans.
Competing for the first time since his poor finish in the Open
Championship, Lyle looked comfortable in surroundings familiar from six
years ago, when he was overtaken in the Los Angeles Open by Mark
Calcavecchia.
Lyle, who is not in the first 25 in the European Ryder Cup team points
list, said he intends playing in the last two counting tournaments after
this one, in Czechoslovakia and Germany.
''I am trying to give Bernard (Gallacher, the captain) as big a
headache as possible,'' said Lyle. ''After this round he'll have his
hands on the aspirin bottle.''
Whether or not such brave talk can be taken seriously remains to be
seen. Montomgerie long since assured of his cup place, thought that he
and Lyle had made the best of their early starts.
Lyle reached the long first in 2 for a birdie and made another from
14ft at the fourth, ranked one of the hardest on the course at which to
defeat par. He saved par at the sixth by chipping close, but his
approach shots to eight and nine, to within nine feet and eight feet
respectively, went unrewarded.
However, after a drive to the brink of a bunker guarding the front of
the green at the tenth, at 315 yards a gem of a challenging two-shotter,
Lyle pitched to eight feet to become three under. He finished strongly,
holing from 12ft at the sixteenth and seventeenth. Scores:
64 -- M O'Meara, J Gallagher Jr.
66 -- G Morgan, C Beck, J Maggert, L Janzen, E Els (SA).
67 -- L Clements, S Lyle (GB), F Dobbs, M Brooks.
68 -- B Claar, J Furyk, B Mayfair, P Senior (Aus), B Crenshaw, N

Parnevik (Swe), D Frost (SA), W Defrancesco, S Brady, D Waldorf, B
Chamblee, N Faldo (GB), J Sluman.
70 -- W Austin, J Cook, M Calcavecchia, F Funk, L Nelson, H Sutton, P
Azinger, M Springer, C Rocca (Italy), B Faxon, T Kite, F Couples.
71 -- R McDougal, K Triplett, D Pooley, R Freeman, M Campbell (N
Zealand), C Pavin, G Waite (N Zealand), H Irwin, N Ozaki (Jap), P Walton
(Ire), P Oakley, I Woosnam (GB), B Kamm, B Andrade, S Simpson.

MIDDLESEX bowler Richard Johnson took two quick scalps yesterday to
boost the title hopefuls' bid for a fifth successive innings victory.
He dismissed former Middlesex man Mike Roseberry and John Morris in
his first four balls to leave Durham reeling at 17 for two after the
second-placed visitors had made 307, John Carr top-scoring with 89.
Leaders Northamptonshire made 321 before reducing Gloucestershire to
22 for three, Anil Kumble taking two wickets in successive balls to
raise his season's tally to 77.
Fourth-placed Lancashire's Pakistani left-arm paceman Wasim Akram took
six Leicestershire wickets for 72 -- his fifth five-wicket haul this
term.
Essex men Graham Gooch and Nasser Hussain each hit thirteen 4s in
their centuries. Gooch's 102 (two 6s) came off 170 balls while Hussain's
103 (one 6) was compiled off 216 deliveries. It was the 118th
first-class hundred of Gooch's career and his fifth of the summer.
Derbyshire captain Kim Barnett hit 14 boundaries in a 205-ball 169
against Worcestershire, Surrey's Nadeem Shahid made 139 (one 6 and
nineteen 4s) off 154 balls and Kent's Nigel Llong took 198 balls to make
his 100, which featured a 6 and fourteen 4s.

Belgrade, Thursday
KRAJINA Serb refugees, angry at their expulsion from Croatia, have
evicted some Croats from their homes in Serbia after beating and
harassing them, civil rights workers and opposition politicians said
today.
Serb refugees had driven 20 families from Sid, Ruma, and nearby
villages in the Vojvodina region in the past few days, an official with
the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina reported.
''These refugees from Krajina are trying to force the local population
of Croats to leave their homes,'' Emil Sejzulahi told Reuters by
telephone from Novi Sad.
The refugees, who were forced to flee their own homes after Croatian
troops seized the Krajina region last week, appeared to have obtained
the addresses of minorities living in the area north of Belgrade.
''It's interesting that refugees know very well what nationality lives
in what house,'' said Sejzulahi.
The League of Social Democrats issued a statement saying some of the
refugees storming houses were armed and called on the police to take
decisive action to prevent further violence.
''We appeal to attacked citizens to remain in their homes and not to
bow to pressures for eviction,'' the statement said.
Independent B-92 radio in Belgrade reported similar cases of
harassment and appealed to Serbs not to take revenge on Croats and other
non-Serbs.
Civil rights workers and UN officials said they were investigating the
reports but warned that such a mass influx of refugees was bound to
trigger vengeance.
The Helsinki Committee for human rights in Serbia also reported
Krajina refugees threatening minorities and breaking into their flats.
Tens of thousands of Serb civilians and soldiers from the Krajina
region have fled to Serbia over the past week. The soldiers are
embittered at their defeat by Croatian forces and Serbia's decision not
to intervene in the fighting.
Although Croats were the main victims, Sejzulahi said ethnic Germans
and Hungarians were also being targeted.
Thousands of Croats have been expelled or chosen to leave Serbia since
the war in former Yugoslavia erupted four years ago. Of the 100,000
Croats who lived in Serbia before the war 60,000 remain.
Large numbers of Serbs have been forced to flee Croatia as well, with
some evicted from their flats in police raids.--Reuter

HEARTS assistant manager Eamonn Bannon has become the latest casualty
at Tynecastle, and yet another compensation wrangle looms.
He was sacked within hours of new manager Jim Jefferies taking Billy
Brown with him from a similar post at Falkirk.
Bannon, who served Hearts twice as a player, arrived with Tommy McLean
last summer after Sandy Clark's sacking, but as soon as McLean was
removed as manager his days were numbered.
Hearts are already wrestling with debts in excess of #4m and are
facing financial claims from former chairman Wallace Mercer, McLean, and
Falkirk. Bannon, with two years of a lucrative contract still to run,
will be seeking compensation of around #100,000.
* CELTA and Sevilla yesterday lost their appeals against a Spanish
Football League (LFP) decision to relegate them from the first to the
third division for accounting errors.
Now the LFP must decide if next season's first division should be
expanded from 20 to 22 teams to allow the two sides to stay in the top
flight.

EAGLESCAIRNIE Farm, near Gifford in East Lothian, is the only Scottish
contender for the Booker Countryside Silver Lapwing Award, the UK's most
prestigious farm conservation award.
The judges toured Mike Williams's 400-acre holding yesterday and, if
there are points for idyllic weather conditions, he is home and dry.
They were particulalry interested in the standard of commercial
farming and forestry, the extent to which farm operations, including
pest and weed control, have been used to obtain maximum economic and
environmental benefit, the creation of new wildlife habitats within the
context of the farming system, and a willingness to seek advice and to
promote conservation.
Mr Williams took up farming nine years ago after an Army career. He
succeeded his father-in-law at Eaglescarnie, having first completed a
farm management course. He has one full-time tractorman and one
part-time gamekeeper/general worker. His wife and business partner,
Barbara, does B &amp; B in the farmhouse.
Winter wheat is the main enterprise, with peas grown as a break crop
and some spring barley. There is a flock of 160 half-bred ewes,
producing fat and store lambs.
The farm is used by the Farming and Advisory Welfare Group (FWAG) to
demonstrate how agriculture and conservation can work together. ''I take
a number of steps to conserve the wildlife, landscape, and historical
interest of the holding,'' said Mr Williams.
''I hope that other local landowners will become enthused and take on
board the practical conservation measures which are possible with
commercial farming.''
The farm now includes 30 acres of woodland which have been
re-structured by a combination of clear felling, partial felling, and
new planting. A hedgerow management scheme has been set up to improve
existing poor quality hedges. By careful cutting, coppicing and gap
filling, new wildlife habitats have been created.
Using set-aside land, Mr Williams has created a 3.5 hectare wildflower
meadow which includes ox-eye daisy, vetches, plantains, and napweed,
which is very attractive to butterflies. Awkward field corners have been
planted with shrubs and trees such ash, rowan, and oak. ''It makes the
farm easier to run and is good public relations,'' said Mr Williams.
Elsewhere, set-aside land has been used for game crops which provide
shelter, access, and food for wild pheasant and partridge. Shooting on
the farm is for family and friends only. Among the birds regularly seen
around Eaglescarnie are lapwing, curlews, oyster catchers, kingfishers,
woodcock, and heron.
The judges for this year's award are Bill Wilder, a Wiltshire dairy
farmer and former FWAG chairman, Robert Campbell, who farms in Cleveland
but also owns Burnhouse Mains at Fountainhall, Midlothian, and Bryn
Green, professor of countryside management at Wye College, Kent.

ALEXANDER Cejka shot an 11-under-par 61, the lowest score on the
European PGA Tour this year, to establish a commanding lead after the
first round of the Hohe Brucke Austrian Open in Litschau.
Play was held up for two hours until early morning mist cleared, but
24-year-old Cejka, who was out early, quickly made up for the lost time
with a round of 11 birdies and seven pars which required only 25 putts.
The Czech-born German's score, a course record for the Waldviertel
Golf Club, beat the existing 1995 Tour best of 62, set by South African
Wayne Westner at the Lexington tournament in February.
Cejka, who defected with his father from Czechoslovakia in 1980 when
he was only nine, already has one Tour victory under his belt, the
Andalucia Open in March.
He was only one stroke short of the all-time European Tour record of
60 shared by seven players, including Ian Woosnam and Darren Clarke, and
only one birdie short of the record 12, held jointly by Ernie Els and
Fred Couples, in European events.
''It was one of those rounds where the putter was very hot,'' said
Cejka later. ''It was easily my lowest ever round.'' Cejka began with
six birdies, parred both the seventh and eighth, and then birdied the
ninth for an outward 29 before notching up further birdies at the tenth,
eleventh, sixteenth, and eighteenth.
Irishman Brendan McGovern came in late with a 65 to share second place
with Steven Richardson, while Paul McGinley, who only entered the
tournament at the last minute, shot a 67.
Leading scores (British and Irish unless otherwise stated. * denotes
amateur):
61 -- A Cejka (Germany).
65 -- S Richardson, B McGovern.
66 -- C Ronald.
67 -- H Thul (Germany), C Davison, T Nielsen (Norway), D Carter, P

strokes clear of the field in the second round of the Seniors Open

WALTER Smith, the Rangers manager, was ready to admit to
disappointment yesterday over his team's narrow win in the European Cup
preliminary round -- but not despair.
Smith was taking a professional look at the situation which now
confronts the Scottish champions, divorcing himself from the emotions
which always surround such occasions and can occasionally cloud the
judgments made from the stands.
The Ibrox official knows how the supporters feel but he pointed out
that a bonus from the game was the fact that Rangers did not concede a
goal against the Cypriot champions.
''We have suffered in the past by losing goals at Ibrox,'' he
stressed. ''This time that has not happened and I believe that we have
the type of team who can go over there and score.
''That is definitely not beyond us. And if we score then they would
have to get three goals. I am not suggesting that I was completely happy
with the game the other night. I had hoped that we might have a more
comfortable cushion to take with us to Cyprus.
''But they defended well and we will have to do the same over there
when they cannot concentrate so much on defensive work but must come
out.
''It is then that we have to gain some advantage.''
Smith will, of course, have new signing Gordan Petric available for
the return and he will go back to the defensive formation he favours. It
was abandoned at half-time against Anorthosis when Gordon Durie appeared
and Brian Reid went off.
Yesterday, however, Smith insisted: ''We will go back to that system.
It was changed at half-time because I had decided to put on Gordon Durie
and ask him to do a specific job. He was not put on as just another
front man. He had a certain role to play and he did what we asked.
''But that doesn't change my thinking about the defensive system. We
will not be changing that.''
Nor will Smith allow any criticism of Paul Gascoigne to deflect his
own beliefs in the value of his biggest signing. Gascoigne, after all,
had not played a full 90 minutes of competitive football since April,
'94.
''You cannot expect to see Gascoigne play as he was when at his peak
with Spurs,'' said the manager. ''He has not had enough games to be at
that level yet. But he will get there and he is still the type of player
who is singled out by the opposition for special marking as he was the
other night,''
''There is no time limit as far as his return to his best form is
concerned. It will take a number of games, we know that and accept it.
''Obviously there was disappointment among the lads in the dressing
room because we did miss a few chances. But we have experienced players
and they recognise what they have to do in the second leg.
''It does not concern me and it won't concern them that the playing
conditions might be difficult. We have to get a goal over there and we
are confident that we can do that.''

Zagreb, Thursday
UN peacekeepers will start withdrawing shortly from former Serb-held
parts of Croatia reconquered by Government troops this week, UN special
envoy Yasushi Akashi said today.
Croatia's reconquest of the rebel Krajina enclave in a blitz over UN
ceasefire lines rendered 10,000 peacekeeping troops redundant and the
United Nations in New York said earlier this week the mission would be
sharply reduced.
''The decision to withdraw various battalions of the military forces
of UNCRO has been taken. It will begin in a matter of days,'' Akashi
told reporters after briefing a senior Croatian Government official on
the plan.
''All our experts are working on concrete plans of withdrawal.
Aeroplanes and ships have to be brought in here to collect equipment. We
will try to expedite this . . . as fast possible but it must be done in
an orderly . . . fashion.''
Akashi signed an agreement with the Croatian Government earlier this
week reducing the UN mission in the former rebel sector to human rights
observers and relief workers.--Reuter

GOVERNMENT plans to put new tenants on probation to curb anti-social
behaviour on housing schemes have been attacked as an erosion of
tenants' rights by the Chartered Institute of Housing in Scotland.
The Institute's Scottish director Alan Ferguson said extreme
anti-social conduct was confined to a small minority. It was
particularly unjust, therefore, that the policy being proposed would
erode the rights of all tenants.
Under the Government's proposals public sector landlords could opt to
put all new tenants on probation for a year.
While welcoming debate on managing estates and difficult tenants, the
Scottish director said the proposals would not give housing managers any
increased powers to deal with anti-social behaviour.

the single-tier authorities to have a parental representative on its
education committee. It is hardly surprising that the council is
exhibiting education innovation in the area of parental involvement. Its
chief executive, David Montgomery, is the former deputy director of
education in Strathclyde region; John Mulgrew, the director of
education, is a former Starthclyde deputy director; and Tom Farrell
remains chair of the authority's education committee, in addition to
chairing East Ayrshire's education committee. Strathclyde has been at
the forefront of developments to involve parents in education. It has
the only education officer whose remit is dealing with parents and
parent-related issues. Its work has recognised, and sought to develop,
the crucial role parents have in their children's education. Research
has confirmed that parents and the home are the ny influence. National
developments such as the programme for five to 14-year-olds also
recognise the importance of parental input. Here, again, Strathclyde has
done superb work with its prompt linking what goes on in the classroom
with the home. And the new 5-14 pupil reports which are being developed
are welcoming, encouraging, and positive.
What is downright negative, at the very least in relation to parental
issues, is the impending break-up of Strathclyde. The new councils will
struggle to carry on the authority's good work because they will have
neither the cash nor the strategic muscle to do so. This is why East
Ayrshire's initiative is so significant. It reflects the education
profession's realisation of the importance of parents. And it shows that
something can be done to build on existing good practice, to involve
parents more imaginatively in their children's schooling. Let us hear no
more of parent power. This and other initiatives which must be protected
are about partnerships between parents, schools, councils, and, yes, the
Scottish Office for the benefit for our children and young people.
Parent power is an arid concept. It is meaningless if you believe it
means opting out in Scotland (now nearly two self-governing schools!).
And Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth has learned about the extreme
problems the placing requests' legislation causes when you seek to match
parental expectation with reality.

Mark Fisher finds audiences will be treated to tantalising treats from
theatre's darker side during Glasgow's Citizens' Theatre autumn season.
JUST in case anyone got the idea that all life ends after the
Edinburgh Festival, Glasgow's Citizens' Theatre has revealed its autumn
programme exclusively to The Herald. As ever, it's an intriguing mix of
old rep favourites and tantalising gems from the darker corners of the
theatrical canon. And there are signs that the theatre's practice of
encouraging designers to try their hand at directing has almost become
official house policy.
Not only is designer Stewart Laing back in the director's chair after
his enthusiastically received production of Strindberg's The Father, but
also Kenny Miller, the theatre's head of design, is making his
directorial debut. Laing is producing The She Wolf by the little-known
turn-of-the century Italian naturalist playwright and novelist Giovanni
Verga in the Stalls Studio from October 4-28. Miller, meanwhile, is
working on a hot-house production of John Osborne's landmark Look Back
in Anger in the Circle Studio in November.
''We've had a really quite distinguished lot of
designers-turned-directors working for us,'' admits artistic director
Giles Havergal, stressing that he's never gone out of his way to
persuade designers to change profession. ''It just happens to be a line
that we feel drawn to because of Philip Prowse working for us as a
director-designer.''
Many of the successes in recent Citz seasons have taken place in one
of the two tiny studio theatres built to complement the mainstage
programme. Havergal relishes the chance they provide to present not only
the relatively obscure, like The She Wolf, but also the familiar. ''Look
Back in Anger follows in the line of The Birthday Party and A Taste of
Honey in that they are reappraisals of famous plays in the context of an
in-the-round studio theatre,'' he explains. ''I think Look Back in Anger
benefits enormously from being done not just as a play from 1956 but as
a play about something that is still relevant.''
Havergal himself is venturing into the Circle Studio for the first
time with a production of Noel Coward's last full-length play, A Song at
Twilight. Though neglected in recent years, it was a hit on both sides
of the Atlantic in 1966 when it starred Coward himself.
''It's an unusual one and a dark one,'' says Havergal. ''It is very
funny, but it's finally a very serious play. It is a serious comment on
the effect of concealment in your life, and how much, in Coward's own
plays and life, the frivolity and the charm were a surrogate for
frankness. This is a line that Philip Prowse has explored very
successfully -- the idea that Coward's plays are more serious than they
appear to be. That was what came out of the Vortex, Private Lives and
Semi-Monde. And this fits in because it's an overtly more serious
play.''
After the Citizens' own Edinburgh International Festival production of
Schiller's Don Carlos, which effectively straddles the summer and autumn
seasons, the mainstage programme features a new production of Sean
O'Casey's Shadow of a Gunman, directed by Citz regular Jon Pope (October
6-28) and, also back from the Edinburgh Festival, TAG Theatre Company's
version of Alasdair Gray's Lanark (November 1-18).
Squeeze in three performances as part of the gay and lesbian festival
Glasgay! at the start of November, and you have a typically diverse
line-up. ''If you put Don Carlos and Robert Louis Stevenson's Ebb Tide
at the start of the list, it doesn't look mainstream at all,'' says
Havergal. ''It looks much more like a Citz programme, which is a mixture
of O'Casey and Coward and stuff you've never heard of.''

THE cost to Castle Douglas-based Wallets Marts of fighting off a
hostile takeover bid from James Craig of Ayr was #108,000, shareholders
were told at the company's annual meeting.
The board will meet soon to draw up plans on how to discourage future
unwelcome bids and determine the future strategy for the company.
Three new directors, including manager Robin Anderson, have been
elected to the board, but former vice-chairman Frances Farries, of
Castlegower, Castle Douglas failed to win re-election. Tom Gillespie of
South Park, Borgue, remains as chairman.
At the annual meeting, seven names were put forward for four places on
the board. Tom Gillespie, the chairman, and Mrs Margaret Fergusson were
the only two directors not facing re-election, after two resignations
earlier this year.
Vice chairman Francis Farries, and John Dalrymple, Auchtralure,
Stranraer, stood for for re-election. They found five others opposing
them -- Robin Anderson, Mungo Bryson, the regional councillor from
Boreland Of Parton, James Johnstone, who runs an oil company, James
Dunlop, chairman of Tarff Valley, and Robert Graham of Irelandton,
Twynholm.
After an overnight count of the votes it was announced that Mr
Anderson, Mr Dalrymple, and Mr Graham had been elected.

MORE years ago than he would care to remember, Pat Nevin was allowed
to walk around Shawfield out of club uniform. He was an individual, a
precocious teenager, and Craig Brown, then Clyde's manager, made
allowances.
Clyde were denied the benefits of such rich, instinctive talent until
Charlie Nicholas strolled into Broadwood yesterday.
Released by Celtic, the 33-year-old had aroused the interest of clubs
in Portugal and Switzerland, but with the help of a Canadian company who
wish to remain anonymous, Clyde put together a financial package good
enough to land a player who, in his prime, was one of the most exciting
ever produced in this country.
Nicholas, who has signed a two-year deal with the second-division
club, arrived at Broadwood yesterday dressed as you would expect --
smart but casual.
Fortunately, the current manager, Alex Smith, is well accustomed to
Nicholas and his ways, the two having worked together successfully as
manager and player at Pittodrie, and he is hoping the former Scottish
internationalist will be able to inspire the youngsters he will find
around him in Clyde's team.
''This is a young side and they can only benefit from playing in the
same team as Charlie,'' Smith said.
Nicholas is looking forward to his new life in the lower leagues. ''I
had been playing mostly in the reserves for the last 18 months, and it
is difficult to remain motivated in front a handful of supporters. I
badly needed to move on in my career and it helped that I had worked
with Alex before.
''I just want to enjoy playing again, and I have the added incentive
of trying to get Clyde into the first division and perhaps even further
than that.
''This club have put themselves on the line to get me here and I am
prepared to do everything I can to make sure it works out for them and
myself.''
* HAMILTON last night signed former Rangers central defender Craig
Paterson, who was given a free transfer by Kilmarnock. Paterson has
played a number of games during the pre-season and will add strength to
their defence.
Former Hamilton midfielder David Nicholls, who has been playing in
Ireland, has signed for Clydebank.
Hamilton and neighbours Airdrie are involved in the top tie of the
first round of the Challenge Cup, formerly known as the B&amp;Q Cup. Draw:
First round -- Stirling Albion v Queen's Park, Albion Rovers v Ross
County, Dumbarton v Brechin, Clydebank v Arbroath, Queen of the South v
Forfar, Caledonian Thistle v Alloa, East Fife v Dundee, Stranraer v
Dundee United, Hamilton v Airdrie, Clyde v St Johnstone, East
Stirlingshire v St Mirren, Ayr v Dunfermline, Livingston v Morton,
Montrose v Berwick.
Ties to be played on August 22 or 23.
* DUNFERMLINE have hit a snag in their efforts to bring former
Yugoslav international striker Dino Valentic over from France.
Manager Bert Paton said: ''He has problems getting a visa, because his
French club, Trasilik, require him to sign before releasing him for a
week's trial with us. He wants to come here as a free agent.''
* RICHARD Moeller Nielsen, who guided Denmark to their first major
title at the 1992 European Championships, yesterday announced he would
be quitting when his contract runs out next summer.
* EMILIO Butragueno has signed a two-year contract with Mexico's
Atletico Celaya. The 32-year-old striker, five times a title winner in
12 seasons with Real Madrid, scored 26 goals in 69 appearances for
Spain.
* DUNDEE United striker Scott Crabbe has picked up a hamstring injury
and will miss tomorrow's first-division opener against Morton at
Tannadice.

Hibernian 0, Middlesbrough 0
BOTH clubs eased their way towards the new season with a dull,
uninspiring friendly which threatened few goals and gave more hints to
the future in England than north of the Border.
Alex Miller fielded a Hibs side that was missing Michael O'Neill,
Keith Wright, and Mickey Weir, so much of the promise that can be
anticipated was removed.
The spotlight was focused therefore on Middlesbrough's #5.25m signing
from Tottenham, Nick Barmby, who was impressive without threatening to
end his side's brief trip north with a victory.
Having recorded that, the England player spotted Jim Leighton off his
line after 31 minutes, and his chip seemed to have the accuracy and pace
to be a winner, until Stephen Tweed ran back to clear.
Eleven minutes earlier Barmby's vision had released Craig Hignett into
a threatening position, but Leighton this time anticipated the danger
and raced from his line to block the shot.
Hignett scored twice against St Johnstone on Monday, and his pace gave
Hibs trouble in 50 minutes when he met a pass from Barmby, but again
Leighton's reflexes kept Hibs level.
Jan-Age Fjortoft struck the top of the bar as Middlesbrough forced the
pace toward the end and then there was concern for them when Barmby
limped off with nine minutes remaining, but his removal owed more to
caution than serious injury.
HIBERNIAN -- Leighton, W Miller, Donald, McGinlay, Tweed, Hunter,
McAllister, Millen, Harper, D Jackson, C Jackson. Substitutes -- Evans,
Dods, G Miller.
MIDDLESBROUGH -- Roberts, Cox, O'Hare, Vickers, Pearson, Whyte,
Mustoe, Pollock, Fjortoft, Barmby, Hignett. Substitutes -- Moreno,
Miller, Blackmore, Kavanagh.
Referee -- A Huett (Edinburgh).

<HEADLINE>Sony up 91% due to currency gain</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>976945191</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
GROUP profit at Sony soared 91% in the first quarter but the rise was
largely due to a gain from currency transactions and its core business
continued to struggle.
Group net profit jumped to 747m yen in the April-June quarter from
Y3910m in the same period a year earlier, the electronics and
entertainment giant said yesterday.
But Sony said this was mainly due to a foreign exchange gain of
Y29.95bn in the quarter, much larger than a similar gain of Y7500m in
the year-earlier period.
Group operating profit, based on Sony's core business operations, fell
steeply because of stiff competition in audio-visual equipment markets
and the sharp appreciation of the yen, which hurt export earnings, the
company said.
''The appreciation of the yen damaged profits severely,'' Sony
managing director Sumio Sano said.
Operating profit plunged to Y15.70bn from Y31.80bn. For the full
business year to next March 31, Sony predicted it would return to the
black with a group net profit of Y41bn, compared to a loss of Y293.36bn
last year.
Sony suffered a big group loss in the 1994/95 business year because of
troubles at its US movie-making operation, which caused it to make a
write-off of goodwill, the value of the operation based on expectations
of future income.
The company said sales in its electronics business rose 4.7% to
Y724.41bn in the first quarter of this year, while sales in its
entertainment business dropped 2.4% to Y168.27bn.
Within the entertainment business, Sony's Pictures Group suffered a
10.1% fall in sales to Y57.79bn because of the rise of the yen.
Mr Sano said the Pictures Group ''returned to profitability during the
last quarter of 1994/95, and profits have steadily increased into the
first quarter''.
Sony's Music Group posted 2.2% sales growth to Y110.48bn, helped by
sales of more than six million copies of Michael Jackson's album HIStory
during the quarter.
Mr Sano said steady sales of Sony's Playstation game player would help
profits in the second half of this business year. One million
Playstations had been sold by May after the product was launched last
December. -- Reuter

Celtic 0, Liverpool 0
APART from the odd burst of serious intent, especially in the second
half, Celtic's last warm-up exercise went along in predictable enough
fashion in front of the 29,554 in attendance at Parkhead.
Liverpool demonstrated some neat, thoughtful play and might have
scored a couple of times. Much the same could have been said of Celtic,
but not until they raised the pace and demanded their share of the ball
after the interval.
German striker Andreas Thom again looked a player with much to offer
once he settles to the British style, while John Collins made
considerable impact when he was on the ball.
Thom was able to get more involved when Celtic changed the pattern in
the second half by bringing on Simon Donnelly for Rudi Vata. New boy
John Hughes, despite having his name taken, made a sound and confident
debut in the defence.
Liverpool coach Roy Evans said later: ''I think that Rangers may get
some competition in Scotland this time. I thought that this was an
improvement in some of the Scottish football, apart from Rangers, I have
seen in recent times.''
Celtic manager Tommy Burns's response, naturally, was guarded.
''Certainly we have got to take up the mantle to challenge Rangers and
that's what we will be judged on. But we still have a bit to go to get
the right blend and there are one or two areas where we could be
improved.''
Collins and McKinlay were effective down the left for a while, but
Liverpool gradually got their own smooth, rhythmic style going.
There was plenty of threat when a Barnes pass put Fowler through.
Celtic claimed offside, with every justification it seemed, but the
linesman was not in agreement and Fowler squandered a great chance by
shooting past the far post.
Neil Ruddock was warned after a harsh tackle on Thom, and a couple of
minutes later shown the yellow card for dissent after Boyd had brought
down Fowler. Hughes got a bit too excited and managed to get his name
taken for a foul on McManaman.
It was Celtic who showed more urgency in the second half. Thom seemed
to be nudged off the ball inside the area, but referee Les Mottram saw
nothing wrong, and then there was a mighty scramble when shots by Thom
and then Collins were blocked.
CELTIC -- Marshall, Boyd, McKinlay, McNally, Hughes, Grant, Vata,
O'Donnell, van Hooydonk, Thom, Collins. Substitutes -- Walker, Bonner,
Falconer, Mowbray, Donnelly.
LIVERPOOL -- James, Jones, Harkness, Scales, Babb, Ruddock, McManaman,
Thomas, Rush, Barnes, Fowler. Substitutes -- Wright, Warner, Bjornbye,
Walters, Matteo, Clough.
Referee -- L W Mottram (Forth).

<HEADLINE>Russia urges peace summit for leaders. Yeltsin unveils five-point plan after meeting Milosevic.</HEADLINE>

Moscow, Thursday
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin today called for the leaders of Bosnia,
Croatia, and Serbia to hold a summit under Russian auspices to pave the
way for an international conference on former Yugoslavia.
He unveiled a five-point peace plan after talks with Serbian president
Slobodan Milosevic and signalled his frustration with international
peace efforts by saying Russia might consider breaking global sanctions
against Belgrade.
''I renew my offer to hold a summit of leading states with the
participation of the warring sides, leaders of the Union Republic of
Yugoslavia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' Yeltsin told reporters in
the Kremlin.
''Russia is ready to organise direct dialogue between the leaders of
the three states, Milosevic, Tudjman, and Izetbegovic, which would be an
important stage in preparing such a meeting.''
Yeltsin launched his initiative on Monday, inviting Milosevic and
Croatian president Franjo Tudjman to Moscow.
However, Tudjman's office said such a meeting should not be held
without Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic.
Tudjman's refusal to come to Moscow limited Yeltsin's hopes of a
diplomatic breakthrough and prompted another Russian condemnation of
Croatia's weekend blitz in Krajina.
''The Croatian Army's military actions in the Serb-populated regions
have pushed the situation in former Yugoslavia to the verge of a big war
in the Balkans,'' Yeltsin said, urging ''fast and firm steps'' to halt
the bloodshed.
He praised the restraint of Serbia, a traditional Russian ally. He
said Belgrade had done enough for sanctions -- imposed over its role in
the fighting -- to be lifted.
''It is time to relieve Yugoslavia of the burden of sanctions,'' he
said. ''Further delays in solving this issue could trigger unilateral
action (by Russia) to leave the sanctions regime.''
Yeltsin said he would raise the sanctions issue with the Contact Group
on former Yugoslavia which comprises Russia, Britain, the United States,
France, and Germany.
The move was partly a gesture to communists and nationalists in the
State Dume lower house of parliament.
It was not immediately clear if Yeltsin was ready to mediate or just
organise the summit and where it should take place.
Milosevic, emerging from two hours of talks, did not say if he
supported the call for a summit, but said he was glad Yeltsin and Russia
understood the Yugoslav crisis.
''There should be a political, not a military solution. There simply
cannot be a military solution,'' Milosevic said.
Itar-Tass news agency said in a report from Zagreb that Croatia was
waiting to receive details of the Moscow initiative through diplomatic
channels before responding.
Yeltsin's plan called for:
* The Contact Group to force Croatia to respect human rights and stop
fighting spreading to Eastern Slavonia or Bosnia;
* Urgent measures to ensure all refugees can return home safely under
the eyes of international observers;
* The security of UN peacekeepers to be guaranteed;
* All hostilities in former Yugoslavia to stop;
* No delay in carrying out a peace deal on Bosnia offered by the
international community.
In London today, British and US officials agreed to press for a new
diplomatic drive.
After four hours of talks with a top-level US delegation, British
officials said they were extremely positive about Washington's efforts
to revive the peace process.
Details of the ideas presented by the team, led by President Bill
Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, were not disclosed.
However, diplomats said Washington appeared to be ready to agree to
easing international sanctions against Serbia in return for its
recognition of Bosnia.
Bill Clinton told reporters at the White House today that recent
developments in the Balkan conflict had created ''a moment of real
promise'' for renewed peace efforts, adding: ''This is an important
moment in Bosnia and it could be a moment of real promise.''
One point in the US plan appears to be a review of a June 1994 plan
drawn up by the Contact Group.
The 1994 plan suggested giving 49% of the country to the Serbs and 51%
to the Muslim-Croat federation. Diplomats said the Muslim-Croat
federation would still be offered more than 50%.
However, Washington appears to believe that the Bosnian Muslims,
bowing to military realities, might be pressured to accept far less land
than in the 1994 plan.
Clinton told reporters: ''We don't have a set map. We don't have a set
position. We have some ideas that the new events may make possible, and
we're discussing it with our allies.'' -- Reuters.

The award of the contract accompanied results for the nine months to

the corresponding period last year, the figures were affected by heavy

<TEXT>
ALEX Ferguson and the Old Trafford faithful were once again united
yesterday following the announcement that Eric Cantona is staying at
Manchester United.
After the loss of Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Andrei Kanchelskis,
United manager Ferguson's stock with the supporters looked set to reach
rock-bottom when the idolised but volatile Frenchman slapped in a
transfer request and left for Paris.
Cantona, banned from football worldwide until October 1 after his
kung-fu attack on a spectator in January, was upset by a Football
Association inquiry into his appearance in a behind-closed-doors
training match against Rochdale.
United's most prized possession signed a three-year contract in March,
but, worn down by his continued brushes with English football's
governing body, he told the club on Monday that he wanted to leave.
That alerted Inter Milan, who bought Ince earlier this summer and have
long admired Cantona.
But Ferguson flew back to Manchester from France yesterday to
announce: ''Eric is staying. I have had a long talk with the boy and he
will be back training with us on Monday.''
The news was welcomed by the Manchester United Independent Supporters'
Association. ''We are delighted he is going to stay,'' said secretary
Andy Walsh. ''We hope now that the FA will stop their petty meddling in
this matter and stop their persecution of Eric Cantona and Manchester
United.''
Ferguson insisted that the player's chagrin had been caused by the FA,
who were unhappy about Cantona's photographed appearance in a casual
practice match -- there were no match officials -- against Rochdale at
United's Cliff training headquarters. The FA have since said they will
be taking no action over the practice match.

HIGH Street annual sales volumes picked up in July and were broadly in
line with retailers expectations for the first time since April after
June's sluggish growth.
But the CBI, in its latest Distributive Trades Survey, says that,
while retailers expect to see some growth in sales during August, this
should be seen in context as business for the time of year seems likely
to be below average. However, on a yearly basis, the underlying retail
sales growth remains upward.
Certainly, there is nothing in the survey to suggest any sharp rise in
consumer spending though the fact that there was an upturn in sales
volumes last month, albeit modest, provides some encouragement.
The highest volume increases in July were reported by footwear,
leather, and clothing retailers. The sharpest falls, compared with one
year ago, were reported by furniture and carpet, and specialist food
retailers.
Off-licences experienced their first rise in sales since January.
Overall, orders placed with suppliers fell very slightly and retailers'
stock levels were more than adequate to meet expected demand.
Wholesalers experienced a pronounced increase in sales volumes during
the month but still slightly less than had been expected. Business was,
though, above average for the time of year and this is expected to be
the case in August. Stock levels were high enought to meet demand and
expected to be even higher this month.
The CBI also reports that motor traders' sales fell in July, although
by less than in the previous two months and by less than had been
expected.
Trade was, therefore, below average for the time of year though not to
the same extent experienced in the previous four months. Orders placed
with suppliers fell as stock levels were higher than needed to meet
expected demand and this trend is expected to have continued into
August.

* WHOLESALE prices in the United States held steady in July, the
Labour Department said yesterday, offering more proof that inflationary
pressures have subsided.
The Producer Price Index was unchanged last month after dipping in
June for the first time in eight months. July energy prices posted their
biggest drop since December 1993, while gasoline recorded its sharpest
decline in four-and-a-half years.
The so-called core rate, which excludes often-volatile food and energy
prices, rose 0.2%.
Wall Street economists said the report would likely cause the Federal
Reserve to hold interest rates steady.
''This is good news plain and simple,'' said Ward McCarthy, managing
director at Stone and McCarthy Research Associates. ''We had a
deceleration in the overall number and the core as well. Especially for
this phase of the business cycle, this is remarkably good news on
inflation.''
More inflation data will become available on Friday when the
department releases a report on July consumer prices.

NEAR euphoria greeted the GKN half-time results as the engineering
group was the latest to to demonstrate the strength of the UK export
economy with pre-tax profits soaring 67% to #163m.
Sentiment was further helped by chairman Sir David Lees who expressed
confidence not only for the remainder of the year but, more crucially,
for the reduced dependence on the cyclical automotive business in the
years ahead. The shares responded by surging 51p to 783p.
The past year or so has been dominated by success.
The most high-profile activities have been those surrounding Westland,
the helicopter builder. It paid #438m for the outstanding 73% minority
after a pretty tough battle but was soon able to pocket #165m of cash
relating to a long-running Westland claim against a Middle East
customer.
That was soon followed by Westland winning a #1200m order for 22 EH101
helicopters for the RAF and another order for 16 is likely for the
Italian navy in the next few months. Both batches of aircraft are being
built as a joint venture with Agusta of Italy so each party will be
taking in about #1000m of work on the original equipment before allowing
for the supply of spares over 30 years, which is more rewarding.
The recent winning of the Apache ''mean machine'' attack helicopter
brings in perhaps #500m of turnover -- relatively impressive numbers
overall but more importantlythat they will provide rising profitability
for the group from 1996 when US car demand may be weakening.
The dominance of the automotive business at present is underlined by
its contribution of an extra 49% at #106m or 68% of pre-interest
profits. European car production rose 9.5% in the half year with exports
and import substitution providing valuable volume.
GKN has been able to increase market share through the success of its
Driveline and constant velocity joint schedules, helped by the rising
proportion of Fiat business it undertakes, which is currently 100%.
The US is seeing some easing in overall car demand but GKN is heavily
exposed to the four-wheel drive and light truck sectors which have grown
faster while it has gained new contracts from Nissan and Ford for people
carriers which carry twice as many joints.
Further ahead, the Italian and German car markets have still to
recover after nearly three years of decline.
Apart from Westland, the defence side is seeing the build-up of
deliveries of Warrior fighting vehicles to Kuwait and Pirhanas to Oman.
Together they are worth more than #600m over four years or so until end
1997. However, the interim overall defence contribution was just 15%
higher although Westland alone, according to one estimate, could be
bringing in perhaps #90m in the 1998 financial year.
That makes the original net consideration of #273m seem a bargain
basement price.
The least glamorous activity is undoubtedly the Chep pallet business
which is half-owned with Brambles of Australia. The business ranges from
of grocery containers to the more sophisticated folding plastic holders
being acquired by Ford to replace costly cardboard packaging which is
used only once.
Chep is surging ahead with its contribution of #10m greater at #17m
and pointing to really significant profits down the line as the German
business develops momentum.
With net cash of #126m or #406m including customer advance payments,
the inevitable question now is where GKN goes next, particularly with
its shares highly rated, selling at 15 times likely earnings. That is on
the basis of full-year profits rising from #200m to about #310m.
Giving money back to shareholders through a hefty dividend increase or
even a share buyback would surely be a cop-out by such good management.
The interim dividend has been raised 9% to 8.75p with a 25p total in
view for a 4% yield.
However, a greater exposure to defence by building up Westland
capacity or in ground support would seem one sure area for progress. In
any event, the stock is more firmly based than at any time in City
memory.

THE defection of Saddam Hussein's Industry Minister together with
other members of Saddam's family is a clear sign of disintegration at
the head of the Iraqi regime. Rivalry among the thugs and opportunists
who surround Saddam is not a new thing. Nor is the sudden demotion or
disappearance of close subordinates. Saddam's strategy to prevent a
rival taking his job has always been to maintain a permanent air of
instability, with any minister who shows signs of ambition being quickly
removed or killed. The technique is crude and by no means original but
in a society distinguished by factions and tribal and religious
sectarian rivalry it has always worked. Matters are a good deal less
certain now.
Saddam's trying summer began with the most dangerous revolt yet
reported, which involved an attempted coup by members of the previously
loyal Dulaymi tribe. The revolt was over by the middle of June, but it
was serious and even then was seen potentially as the first sign of the
collapse of the regime. The defection of Hussein Kamel Hassan, who was
not just Industry Minister and the man who built up the Iraqi military
machine but, more crucially, the minister directly in control of
negotiations with UN envoy Rolf Ekeus, is far more serious. Saddam
believed he was within striking distance of persuading the UN that he
had complied with the requirements necessary to allow the lifting of the
ban on Iraqi oil sales. Hussein Kamel controlled the negotiations which
will now be seriously disrupted.
In fact there was little chance of the UN lifting the embargo, partly
because it has been effective in putting pressure on the regime and
partly because Rolf Ekeus is unhappy with some aspects of the Iraqi
evidence. True, there has been evidence of suffering caused to Iraqi
civilians, but the blame for this must be laid against Saddam. The
evidence of the defections suggests that Saddam is in serious trouble
and this impression is heightened by King Hussein's boldness in giving
asylum to the defectors. Only a fool makes predictions in the Middle
East, but the sanctions must continue while this latest affair runs its
course.

<HEADLINE>Mexico and Barings hit Small Companies Trust</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>976945200</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
EVENTS as diverse as Mexico's financial crisis and the collapse of
Barings Bank are being blamed by Edinburgh Fund Managers for the
relatively poor performance of small companies on stock markets.
Edinburgh Small Companies Trust, an #85m investment trust managed by
EFM, has reported a decline of 2.6% in its net asset value to 100.19p a
share in its year to June 30.
In the early months of this year, investor confidence was tested by
the Mexican and Barings crises.
''While neither has a direct impact on the UK equity market, they did
serve to remind investors of the higher risk and reward associated with
certain investments, and, for a short period of time, inevitably
focussed greater attention on the safer havens of blue chips and
gilts,'' said Donald MacDonald, the trust's chairman.
Political uncertainty in the UK reinforced this view and while the
equity market moved higher it was centred mostly on the larger
companies. Smaller companies in fact underperformed their larger
counterparts in most world markets, including the UK.
As a result the Extended Hoare Smaller Companies Index rose just 0.9%
in the 12 months to June 30, while the more broadly based All-Share
Index gained 10.9%, reflecting the stronger performance of larger
companies.
Edinburgh Smaller Companies itself underperformed the benchmark
smaller companies index. All of this occurred in the first half and was
blamed on high gearing and on two disappointing new issues. In the
second half gearing and stock selection had a positive impact but not
enough to recoup the first-half underperformance.
For most of the year gearing averaged 14%. But the maximum potential
gearing was raised to 20% through a Debenture issue. At the year end
gearing stood at 19.5%.
The final dividend has been increased from 0.21p to 0.25p from
earnings per share of 0.54p (0.72p).
Mr MacDonald said: ''Providing earnings continue to grow at a faster
pace, we believe the smaller companies sector will re-establish its
historic relationship with blue chips and provide superior share price
performance during this stage of the economic cycle.''

ON the back of a strong rise in revenue, Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment
Trust has raised its interim dividend by 5% to 0.63p.
The group, which is the largest investment trust, now capitalised at
more than #1500m, yesterday said revenue increased 14% in the first half
of the year as a result of strong dividend growth in the UK, higher
fixed interest income, and a change in the timing of some income.
Earnings per share were up 36%.
In the six months, Foreign &amp; Colonial shares rose 2.2%, trailing the
4.5% rise in net assets to 140.8p. The shares currently stand at 143p, a
discount of 1.8%.
The asset performance suggests the trust underperformed its markets as
in the same period the UK market was up 6.7% and there were currency
adjusted gains of 16.6% and 8.1% in the US and Germany respectively. But
there was a 10.7% fall in Japan.
The trust's manager, Michael Hart, said the performance was adversely
affected by having 12% of the portfolio in Japan and their caution over
the strength of the yen. Latin America was also disappointing. He
considers the UK and Continental European markets offer better value
than the US.
He is encouraged by Japan's recent rally and the positive action taken
by the Japanese Government to alleviate the economic malaise.
Foreign &amp; Colonial has got to grips with its expenses which were
rising too fast as a result of the cost of running its private investor
plan. This has been checked by moving to a nominee system.
Chairman John Sclater acknowledged that administrative difficulties
have arisen and said the group was working to resolve them.

* Willis Corroon yesterday reported a 23% jump in half-year profits
despite tough trading conditions in the insurance market.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to the end of June grew to #66.3m
from #54.1m in the corresponding period last year.
Chairman Roger Elliott said: ''Conditions in most insurance markets
are tough for insurance brokers at the moment.
''However, we have seen conditions like this before, which help us to
obtain better terms for our clients' insurance and reinsurance
programme.''
He emphasised the cost-cutting programme begun at the end of last year
was still going on and was steadily bringing about savings.
By the end of June, the savings amounted to #11.8m with staff numbers
cut by 855 since September last year.
''We remain on the course we have set ourselves,'' said Mr Elliott.
Turnover from international operations grew by 21% with particularly
strong growth coming from aerospace, non-marine broking services, and
North American reinsurance business.
Shareholders are to be paid an unchanged interim dividend of 3.3p on
earnings per share up from 7.8p to 9.7p.

A CONFIDENT Royal Insurance has increased its interim dividend by a
quarter to 5p as a further step towards rebuilding the payout to
shareholders.
Profits reached a record #241m in the first half of the year, up 26%,
but dividends still have a long way to go up catch up with the 26p paid
in 1990 before the insurers fell on hard times. Everything is looking
brighter, with no sign of a sharp fall in premium rates and the US
operations recovering.
However, the UK is less buoyant than it was, with underwriting surplus
falling from #78m to #40m as a result of softer rates and competition.
Personal lines premiums fell 5%, with new business hard to attract at
the rates Royal was prepared to offer.
Commercial rates were more stable except for the motor sector, where
Royal lost market share in fleet business because rates were inadequate.
''The overall drift in rates is downwards,'' said chief executive
Richard Gamble, ''but it's certainly not in free-fall.''
Offsetting lower premiums was a drop in claims frequency. Overall car
numbers covered by Royal remained unchanged at about a million. Its
direct insurance operations, Royal Direct and The Insurance Service,
accounted for 45% of the business but insurance brokers are fighting
back against the direct writers and clawing back some market share.
UK Life profits were up a bit at #28m despite sharply lower single
premiums, though new annual premiums were only 6% down. The long-running
losses in the estate agency continued, with a #9m deficit, but Royal
thinks it is still worthwhile because of the life business it brings in.
The US operation is recovering well under its chief executive Bob
Mendelsohn, with the underwriting loss more than halved to #56m. Mr
Mendelsohn said there was an underlying improvement as corrective
actions took hold, in addition to lower weather and catastrophe losses,
such as the Los Angeles earthquake.
A reorganisation has brought underwriters closer to customers which is
reducing claims costs. They are currently ahead of the industry average.
Mr Mandelsohn's ambition is to make Royal US the most profitable insurer
in its niche area of small and medium sized firms.
Activities in Canada and other overseas areas increased their
contribution.
Royal shares gained 9p to 349p, with the results ahead of expectations
and with analysts particularly impressed by the 23% increase in asset
value to 354p per share on the back of firmer markets.

Frankfurt, Thursday -- The Bundesbank said its policy-making council
left Germany's key discount and Lombard interest rates unchanged after
its regular meeting, the first after a four-week summer break.
The German discount rate remains at 4% and the Lombard emergency
financing rate at 6%.
The central bank's main money market rate, the repo, fell five basis
points to 4.45% yesterday, the first major downward move since March.
German financial markets responded calmly to news of the unchanged
rates. The September future on German Government bonds, or bunds, inched
higher to 95.14.
On the stock market, the 30-share DAX index was barely changed on the
news. It stood 5.25 points down at 2216.52.
Early this week, markets were awash with speculation the Bundesbank
would cut interest rates today. Players said low inflation, sluggish
money supply growth, and a perceived slowdown in the economy all pointed
to a fresh easing.
But this view changed after the Bundesbank allowed its key money
market rate, the repo, to fall by five basis points, the first
significant cut since March.
Analysts and market players said this signalled the Bundesbank was
likely to wait for some weeks, until the repo has come down further,
before contemplating a new move.
The Bundesbank did not make any comment on its next securities
repurchase agreement operations in its announcement following today's
council meeting.
There had been some market speculation that the central bank would set
a fixed rate securities repurchase tender for next week, although most
traders in the German money market believed this was highly unlikely.
News that Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer would not attend today's
meeting also prompted some to speculate that the central bank would not
make a major policy decision in his absence. -- Reuter

A #23.5M takeover of office equipment servicing and distribution group
Copymore looks almost certain following an agreed offer by an American
company, announced yesterday.
Alco Standard Corporation is a paper distributor in North America, as
well as having the largest independent copier dealer network there and
in Britain. It is offering Copymore shareholders 214p per share.
''The acquisition of Copymore is the next step in our strategy of
building a significant market presence in the UK and Copymore will
contribute significantly to our existing UK operations,'' said Ian
Crabb, chief executive of Alco Office Products (UK).
Copymore chairman David Pope, who is advising shareholders to accept
the deal, said the group's future could be best secured by becoming part
of a larger organisation with access to bigger resources.
''There is a great commercial logic to our business becoming part of
the Alco dealer network,'' he added. ''We believe that the offer is fair
and reasonable for our shareholders and will be beneficial for our
staff, customers, and suppliers.''
In the year to the end of December, Copymore made a pre-tax profit of
#1.7m on turnover of #39.8m.

EDINBURGH Oil &amp; Gas was helped to record pre-tax profits at the
halfway stage by Glasgow-based electricity giant ScottishPower.
Alliances between the exploration and production company and
ScottishPower in North and South Yorkshire helped Edinburgh turn a
#60,000 loss for the first half of last year into a #378,000 profit in
the six months to end-June.
Managing director Alf Bissett believes Edinburgh, which started out as
an oil investment company, will pay its maiden dividend as an explorer
and producer this year, assuming it has a profitable second half.
In North Yorkshire, gas from Edinburgh's Kirby, Misperton, and Malton
fields is being used by ScottishPower to generate electricity at
Knapton.
The company has also linked up with ScottishPower's CaledonianGas
subsidiary, which buys gas from Edinburgh's Hatfield Moors field in
South Yorkshire and transports it through the British Gas network to its
own customers.
These new projects, which came on stream at the turn of the year,
boosted average daily production to 700 barrels of oil equivalent per
day, from an average of 391 boepd for the whole of last year. Turnover
leapt 74% to #1.54m.
Gas accounted for 52% of total production, compared with only 16% last
year.
As a result of the seasonal nature of gas demand, sales from Hatfield
Moors are likely to be lower in the second half.
Last month, Edinburgh announced the buy-out of Kelt's 37% interest in
the South Yorkshire field for more than #500,000, and now owns 100%.
A #3.88m share placing and open offer, in March last year, provided
funds for Edinburgh's 63% share of Hatfield Moors' #2m-plus development
cost and its acquisition of Kelt's stake.
The new funds will also be used in the autumn to drill development
wells at Crosby Warren, near Scunthorpe, and West Firsby, near Lincoln.
Edinburgh has a 100% interest in the Crosby Warren oil field and a 47%
stake in West Firsby.
Mr Bissett said yesterday the results of these projects would have a
big impact, not only on the second half, but on Edinburgh's future
performance. He added: ''These are the most important wells we have been
involved in to date. We are looking for success in these wells to
continue the growth.''
Edinburgh appears on track for annual pre-tax profits of about
#520,000, nearly three times the previous year's level of #185,000.
Interim profits included #97,000 of gains from Edinburgh's sale of
investments in other exploration and production companies.
Edinburgh's shares, which moved from the Unlisted Securities Market to
the official list on May 4, were yesterday unchanged at 19p.

The Felicia has taken Skoda out of the bargain basement, Ross Finlay
reports
SOME years ago, the rear-engined Skoda Estelle had the unusual feature
of a side-hinged front bonnet, so that shopping and so on could be
loaded into it while the user stood on the pavement. It was a pretty
good safety idea, negated in UK-market cars by the fact that the bonnet
still had hinges on the original side. To load the boot of a right-hand
drive example you had to stand out in the middle of the road. However,
this was not a matter of the Czech designers being a bunch of
dumb-bells. The plain fact was that, in those days as a nationalised
company, Skoda was starved of investment even for such obvious
modifications.
Really, Skoda did remarkably well under the dead hand of communist
government planning and financial control. Its designers and engineers
never had the budget to produce anything very special, but they always
kept their under-funded development department going, and they made a
place for the company in motorsport circles by managing to run a
successful competition department which scored -- and still does score
-- many class wins in international rallies.
Things have changed, of course, not just because of the
democratisation of the Czech Republic, but also thanks to the finance
and management expertise from which Skoda now benefits as part of the
Volkswagen group. It is a sign of the times that the new Felicia model
is taking Skoda out of the bargain basement. One Scottish dealer
delivered 30 N-registered Felicias on the first of this month, and only
half of them were the base-model LX.
While that car is fitted with a 54bhp engine, the more expensive
models like the GLXi I have been driving use Skoda's familiar 1289cc
engine in tuned-up 68bhp form. That allows for a test-track maximum just
three miles per hour up on the LX's 90mph, and trims a fair amount off
the 0-60mph sprint, which the GLXi manages in about 14 seconds, lively
enough for what is a very spacious car by the standards of the 1300
class.
Not being under such pressure on the usual steady-speed fuel
consumption checks, the GLXi is more economical. It will return
something like 51mpg at 56mph and 37 at 75, as well as 38mpg around
town.
Like the Favorit, from which it developed, the Felicia is a genuinely
roomy car for its overall size. Skoda provides comfortable seating space
for four tall adults within quite a compact bodyshell, and there is no
compromise needed for six-foot passengers sitting in the rear, although
some will not like the seat-back angle. The boot capacity in this
five-door hatchback is enhanced by the unusual depth.
With a far more stylish and better fitted-out cabin than any Skoda has
had before, as well as much better upholstery and trim, the GLXi costs
#7249 in the showroom, while the same mechanical specification is
available in the LXi at #5949 and the LXi Plus at #400 more. The GLXi
comes as standard with a tilting glass sunroof, which unfortunately does
not have any kind of pull-across sunblind, a curious omission since that
almost essential feature used to be available on the Favorit.
The 68bhp engine is willing enough, but a little throaty as you might
expect from an older design. There is a pleasant driving position, good
glass area, sensible stowage areas inside, a slightly floppy gear change
and some neat touches like the angling of the outside dials on the
instrument panel towards the driver, although it is a bit silly that the
driver's knees tend to reflect on the panel. The top-ranked Felicia may
have one or two little quirks of its own. But the days when the Skoda
was a quirky car all round are long gone.

James McKillop reports that while the jury in the Maxwell trial takes
a holiday after 49 hard days at the office the costs of the case
continue to spiral.
MORE than most, the seven women and five men who make up the jury on
the Maxwell brothers' trial thoroughly deserve their summer holiday.
Yesterday was Day 49 of an inquisition that began back in May. It was
also the day the jury were told that they need not report back until
August 29. After their summer break they can expect more of the same.
While the prosecution believe they are whizzing through the evidence
faster than they thought possible, it will still be a long time before
the defence have their say. The jury will be lucky if they are invited
to retire to consider verdicts by November.
The trial got under way at the tail end of May in a blaze of
publicity. The world's press gathered outside and inside Chichester
Rents, an office block in London's Chancery Lane.
However, the second floor of the building has been taken over by the
Central Criminal Court.
To all intents it looks exactly what it is, an open-plan office.
People sit behind computer screens at desks. Occasionally someone plays
with a laptop computer. They work under fluorescent lighting.
Nevertheless, it is a court of law -- indeed it is officially Court 22
of the Old Bailey.
While in other courts not far away in the Strand QCs and judges have
been given the dispensation not to wear wigs, here they observe all the
formalities, no matter the heat outside. In this hi-tech courtroom they
have the benefit of air conditioning.
Yesterday was a particularly busy day as far as the press was
concerned. About 10 of us turned up, presumably because the court was
about to go into recess for the summer holiday. It could not have been
because we were anticipating riveting evidence and sensational
headlines.
Ian Huntington, a KPMG accountant who had been seconded to the Serious
Fraud Office as an assistant director, was in the witness box.
That gives a false impression. He was not actually in a witness box.
He sat behind a desk with a red folder in front of him with two
microphones, a water jug, and tumbler to his side.
The jury is so far away at the other end of the room they would have
been unable to see him but for a television camera and the screens on
their desks in what is more a work station than a jury box.
Goodness knows what they are making of it all. Sensible rules bar
journalists from inquiring. However, John Steele, the man from the
Telegraph, who has heard as much as they have, says: ''I find it quite
engrossing.'' We begin to worry about John.
Certainly there were some interesting moments yesterday, especially
when Alun Jones, QC, for Kevin Maxwell -- the principal defendant in
this conspiracy trial alleging fraud on a massive scale on the Mirror
Group and other Maxwell company pension funds -- asked about the arrest
of his client.
Kevin Maxwell's solicitor had written to the Serious Fraud Office
saying that his client was perfectly happy to report at a police station
to answer any questions that might be put to him.
Instead, he was arrested early in the morning with the world's press
encamped outside his front door.
Mr Jones requested that the Sun's coverage of the event be displayed
on the court's television screens.
''GOTCHA'' was the main headline.
Underneath there was a quote from Mr Maxwell's wife: ''P*** off or
I'll call the police.'' Alongside was the response from those knocking
on the door: ''We are the police, Mrs Maxwell.''
The witness was pressed on whether a decision had been taken to make
the arrest in the full glare of publicity to humiliate the Maxwell
brothers. ''Hadn't the decision been taken that it was time these young
lads had their comeuppance and there was going to be a public nicking?''
''Certainly not,'' the witness replied. Mr Huntington was the 29th
prosecution witness.
The trial judge, Sir Nicholas Phillips, is very strict and would be
extremely unhappy if The Herald indicated at this stage how many more
Crown witnesses were likely to be called. Certainly there are more than
a few and the prosecution expect to be calling witnesses well into
October.
The judge has reduced the task of the jury. One of the original four
defendants, Robert Bunn, suffered a heart-attack last month and is too
ill to continue to defend himself. As a consequence, the jury will be
asked to deliver verdicts against only three defendants: Kevin and Ian
Maxwell, and former Maxwell director Larry Trachtenberg.
Of course, all of this is costing the country a packet. At this stage
they are not even attempting to work out the sums. They are just signing
cheques.
By accident I met one of those civil servants who was rubber-stamping
the claims. To say the least, he was bemused over the amounts involved.
Because of the Official Secrets Act he could not say much.
Nevertheless, I can reveal that even at this stage with the Legal Aid
bills for QCs and their teams still pouring in, there can be no doubt
that when the jury finally return verdicts, the Maxwell investigation
and trial will have cost the nation well over #30m.

THE dollar had a good day on the foreign exchanges after the
Bundesbank's largely expected decision to leave two key interest rates
unchanged.
In the Far East, the US unit recovered further to Y92.83 compared with
less than Y80 last week. More support was later added when US economic
data reassured the market which was able to seize upon technical factors
and chart points to encourage buying. Unusually, the Swiss franc took a
drubbing against the dollar partly because it is a narrower traded
currency than the German mark.
The pound was hit by the dollar and dropped from $1.6010 to $1.5890
while gaining around a pfennig against the mark to close at DM2.2602.
The trade weighted index was unchanged at 84.5.

TO COMPLY with a Brussels directive, from October 1 it will become a
criminal offence to display imperial measurements instead of metric.
Imperial weights may be shown but the metric measure must be dominant.
Shopping will become complicated. Customers face hours with a
calculator. Shops that fail to comply with the ruling face a #5000 fine.
It is expected that by the year 2000 Britain will be fully metricated.
Many, however, are still unaware of the approach of ''M-Day''. There has
been little publicity, the sparseness of which has been attributed to
the fact that this latest surrender to Brussels could be a major
embarrassment to the Government. Mass publicity could reawaken the Euro
rebels.
Journalist Christopher Booker, Sunday Telegraph columnist, veteran
campaigner against red tape, and conspiracy theorist, says that
metrication is not just a practical conversion but a spiritual one. He
calls the transaction between Britain and Brussels ''symbolic''. (M-Day
was initially sheduled for January this year.) He infers insidious
deceit. The Government have yet to release an explanatory leaflet
preparing the public for what is about to happen. But what metrication
advertises is what people know already, that Britain will be bound
closer to Europe, and it will be at some cost to tradition.
Decimal Day itself took place on February 15, 1971, when Britain
replaced pounds, shillings and pence with decimal currency. All did not
go well. Furious housewives, for example, formed WASP, the Women's
Association for Stabilising Prices, after shopkeepers raised prices in
the name of ''rounding up''. What all consumers today, including the
elderly, must understand is that the price which confronts them on any
shelf on any product from October will be metric, and it will appear
that inflation has ballooned. Cheese or cold meat which was advertised
at #1.72 per pound, will suddenly be tagged as #3.79 per kilogramme.
Products already sold in kilos include cooking oil, coffee, cereals
and ice-cream. Only prices for meat, poultry, fish, cheese and bacon
will change. There are exceptions to the rule, including the retention
of pints for milk and beer and miles for road signs. Loose fruit and
vegetables can be sold in pounds until the year 2000.
The metric system was first adopted in France following the revolution
in 1799. It is allegedly the ultimate in rational measuring methods, the
pinnacle of the new age of enlightenment. But the metric system is an
old system. It evolved from a mixture of Roman measures and units. It
was designed to unify a scrum of vastly different local units. But
arguments by scholars rage as to which system is the most accurate.
Some say the romanticism of the imperial system is far more logical.
Arthur Whillock founded the Dozenal Society in 1944 to protect
traditional measuring systems. It's tough deciding whether such a man
has a point or just doesn't get out enough. He has been quoted as
saying: ''The imperial system is scientifically more precise because
there are more common fractions in it. Metric is based on units of ten
-- which is divisible only by two and five. Imperial is based on
twelves, which can be divided by two, three and four.''
The generation gap, however, means that most people have a
schizophrenic grasp of the metric and imperial system anyway. Each
individual has either a full or scant knowledge of weights and
measurements. As a colleague volunteered: ''I know that a metre is
longer than a yard. My wife thinks in yards when she buys material and
they convert it for her in the shop.'' It is clear there is a culture of
incomprehension which will pervade all malls, markets and centres long
after M-Day.
Stores are not intimidated by the challenge. Marks and Spencer are
making full use of the next few years to change clothes sizes to metric.
''Our food has been metric for several years now so it is not causing us
any problems.''
Safeway are implementing measures, so to speak, to combat
misunderstanding. ''We are going to be displaying products in imperial
and metric. We recognise that it will be difficult for customers to
adjust and are distributing material to help people cope with the
changes.''
However, it was Napoleon, no less, who argued in 1823, that ''Nothing
is more contrary to the organisation of the mind, of the memory and of
the imagination (than) the new system of weights and measures . . . It's
just tormenting the people with trivia!'' Citizens today may, or may
not, disagree.

THE latest chapter in the Balkan tragedy, the exodus of 200,000 Serbs
from Krajina, has prompted letters from Neil Craig and Alan Clayton
(August 9) which -- from what can be seen as opposite viewpoints --
contain considerable elements of special pleading.
To take Mr Craig's letter first. It is simply not credible for him to
claim that the Bosnian Serb army have used only infantry mortars in this
conflict: they have made extensive use of heavy artillery, fired on to
civilian populations, as I can testify from personal experience.
Indeed, on May 25 this year a single BSA artillery round fired on
Tuzla killed 72 young people gathered in the streets to celebrate the
old Yugoslav Youth Day -- Tito's birthday.
It is simply not credible to claim that these heirs to the Chetniks
''don't seek one foot of land primarily inhabited by any other group''
-- and in any case, looking at land and people in this way is
reminiscent of the ''Group Areas Act'' of apartheid South Africa.
On the other hand, it is disingenuous of Alan Clayton to assert that
what is going on in Krajina is not ''ethnic cleansing'' and that the
population of Krajina ''were to be encouraged to view themselves as
orthodox Croatians, with a positive and constructive role to play in the
new state''. Would that it were so.
The reality is that the Serbs of Krajina, through massive artillery
bombardments, indiscriminate beatings, and the burning of their
villages, have been forcibly reminded of the massacres of hundreds of
thousands of Serbs by Croatian fascists during the Second World War.
The exodus of Serbs from Krajina perfectly suits the purposes of the
present hard-line nationalist government in Zagreb, and I would be
intrigued to know that government's response to Mr Clayton's suggestion
that the Serbs be brought back through ''mass repatriation under
international supervision''.
Meanwhile, those in Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, and -- especially --
Bosnia Herzegovina who are continuing the struggle against
ethnic/religious separatism and xenophobia are under greater pressure
than ever.
Perhaps it is time to redouble our efforts not just to provide
humanitarian aid, but also to support those throughout former Yugoslavia
who are prepared to stand against racism and xenophobia.
I know that such people exist in the trade-union movements of former
Yugoslavia, and in other sections of civil society.
It is their side that we should be taking, not that of any of the
criminal incompetents in government offices (not just in the Balkans)
who are responsible for the bloodbath since 1991.

YOUR editorial rightly demands that the Scottish Office provide
accurate and timely economic statistics for Scotland (August 10). The
current indicators, however inaccurate, still do not delve deep enough.
To allow comparison with our competitors we need clear figures for
Scottish GDP, GDP per capita, import/export (including a breakdown by
country), defence expenditure, and taxes collected in Scotland (this
should include tax from resident Scots working for companies registered
in England).
On the latter point, I work in Scotland yet my employer (a ''British''
company) is registered in London. Consequently, all my income tax is
regarded as coming from an English-registered company. My contribution
to the Scots economy is therefore disregarded, and indeed used falsely
to inflate English revenue statistics.
How many thousands of other Scots are in this position? How many
millions of pounds of their revenue is secretly spirited away?
If the Government and the Scottish Office continue to peddle the
''subsidy junkie'' myth, they could at least ensure that their figures
are meaningful and fair.

YOUR editorial on the provision of economic data by the Scottish
Office complains about the speed with which data are produced and the
revisions to previous statistics (August 10). Perhaps I might be
permitted to set the record straight and correct your factual errors.
First, you state that the Index of Production and Construction is six
months out of date. You might usefully check your calendar. The data for
the first quarter of 1995 were published on August 9 -- ie, just over
four months after the end of the relevant quarter.
Second, you imply that the 1993 GDP figures for Scotland have yet to
cross the Secretary of State's desk. You do not seem to have your finger
on the economic pulse. These data were published, with a press release,
on July 19 and comprise a valuable index of disaggregated output, which
has no counterpart in the English regions.
Your comments are less than gracious, when set against the volume of
high quality statistical data which form the raw material for so much of
The Herald's copy.
Your economics editor has consistently drawn at length on material
published by the Scottish Office, not only the Index of Production and
Construction and GDP statistics, but also data and analysis published in
the Scottish Economic Bulletin, various statistical bulletins and the
input-output tables.
Quite right too. It is our job to provide data for public discussion
as well as for ministerial briefing.
Of course, there is a continual need to improve the quality of
coverage of Scottish economic data in order to enhance public debate and
Government decision-making. However, a certain amount of realism is
required.
There are inevitable limitations imposed, not only by resource
constraints, but also by the legitimate requirement to avoid burdening
businesses and other organisations with excessive form-filling.
The quality of Scottish economic data will be improved through the
careful analysis of its existing limitations and the investigation of
new or alternative sources of information. The Scottish Office is
currently examining these issues in detail.
Misleading and ill-informed whingeing is not sufficient.

Senior Economic Adviser,

I WAS interested in Lillian McKenzie's letter referring to the Glasgow
Smiles Better stickers in Moscow recently (August 8).
Such stickers go back further than this summer in the old USSR,
however. In Western European eyes, Bukhara, Uzbekistan, Central Asia,
can fairly be regarded as the back of beyond. In 1984, seated in a bus
in the middle of that city, much of which consists of mud and straw
houses, my wife and I were really only mildly suprised to see a sticker
on the driver's window proclaiming that ''Glasgow's Miles Better''.
Although a Paisley man, I had to agree, especially if the statement
had referred solely to a comparison between the public-toilet standards
in the two cities, those in Bukhara giving the most hardened travellers
severe attacks of the shudders.

Tony Blair has taken the 'New' Labour Party to within sight of victory
at the next General Election -- but at what cost? In the wake of Richard
Burden's attack on the style of leadership, Julia Langdon warns there
are many others who silently share his views.
IT WAS late in the evening just before the House of Commons rose for
the summer recess. MPs were waiting for one last vote before they could
go home. It was hot and everyone was tired. The distinguished former
minister had been nursing the same glass of beer for some time as he
ruminated about life and times at Westminster and what he had to say was
as bitter as the ale he was drinking.
He was troubled and his concern was all about the way in which Tony
Blair was running the Labour Party. Oh, of course, he had supported the
man on Clause 4: it was the right thing to do, although he personally
thought it was the wrong time to do it.
And he was delighted, too, that Blair's approach had so forcibly
established a lead in the opinion polls for ''New'' Labour and, yes,
that it really did look as if the chance of a Labour Government was
within grasp. But at what cost? That was what worried him.
He was profoundly uneasy. He didn't like the dictatorial nature of
Blairism. It looked to him like arrogance. It didn't chime with his kind
of politics, his Labour Party, his background. He didn't like some of
the people who were popping up. Who were they? Where had they come from?
Were they even members of the party? The word in the Shadow Cabinet
researchers' corridor was that any number of people had been recruited
who hadn't the first idea about how the Labour Party functioned -- and
that they didn't care, because nobody thought it mattered anyway.
''Ah well,'' he said miserably, as the division bells rang at last and
he drained his beer and went off to do his democratic duty, ''I suppose
I'm just an old has-been. What do I matter any more?''
As it happens, he is not an old man. He is in his early 50s and has a
lifetime of loyalty to successive Labour leaderships behind him. And he
does matter. He matters because he is not alone in this anxiety. There
are many like him who share his views and his reservations and who may
be prepared to express them privately but who would resign rather than
reveal them to the readers of the New Statesman. In his sort of Labour
Party, MPs do not speak or write openly about what is in their mind if
it is to the detriment of the party in general.
So while Richard Burden, the Labour MP for Birmingham Northfield, has
articulated a point of view which he is not alone in holding when he
criticises Tony Blair's allegedly Stalinist disapproval of dissent, he
will not win many Brownie points among his colleagues for the manner in
which he did so.
Some Labour MPs, members of what should be termed the Predictable Left
Group, were quick to join in the scrap. Max Madden spoke of the
criticism of Tony Blair's style having reached ''crisis levels'' within
the parliamentary party, while Jeremy Corbyn claimed that there were
about 100 MPs who shared Burden's view. Others, more sanguine, were
sceptical about Burden's message and, more importantly, his motives.
''He is not the first obscure Labour back-bencher to work out you can
become famous for attacking your own party,'' one of his MP colleagues
commented sardonically, having drawn attention to the fact that Burden
was virtually unknown even to his colleagues.
Others referred to the fact that he was a former officer in the
white-collar union Nalgo (an acronym that used to be said to stand for
Not A Lot Going On) and had been what another Labour MP called
''something of an open-toed firebrand'' in his youth. Someone suggested
that Burden did not really exist but had actually been invented by Dr
Brian Mawhinney to further his on-going onslaught on New Labour.
Labour's deputy leader, John Prescott, did not take much trouble to
disguise his disdain for Burden and the manner in which he had disrupted
the peaceful progress of normal political life in August, not least by
absenting himself from the scene by the time the troublesome article hit
the news stands. But both Prescott and his colleague Robin Cook were
noticeably careful in their responses to display a degree of sensitivity
to the issues raised. The party deputy leader emphasised in particular
that there was nothing inconsistent between having an effective
electoral machine and a party with a radical ideology.
For they are both acutely aware that whatever the motivation and the
manner in which it was conveyed, Burden's message is a real one and one
that will be heard by others who share his views. It would be a mistake
for that to be disregarded.
In the offending article, Burden had referred to the fact that the
Labour Party had become the ''most professional Opposition party in
history''. But most long-term members of the Labour Party who have
watched with increasing gloom as its leaders have mounted a highly
unprofessional Opposition -- and, indeed, for much of the 16 years that
the party has sat on the Speaker's left-hand in the House of Commons has
virtually mounted no Opposition at all, being far too busy with internal
self-analysis -- could not be other than delighted at the impact Tony
Blair has made. It is this weariness with Opposition which has provided
Blair with a largely acquiescent party, ready to try anything, prepared
to accept even the revisionist policies that have been proposed, in the
interests of securing office.
That is why little has been heard to challenge the undoubtedly
autocratic approach that Blair has adopted.
Even so, acute political operators like Messrs Prescott and Cook are
well aware of the nature of the Labour Party, the rumblings that have
continued just below the surface as the opinion polls consistently lift
the party leader ever closer to real power. If and when that time comes
there will be some difficulties for the next Labour Government. It will
not have an easy time with what remains of its own left -- as has
already been revealed as a result of Dr Mawhinney's successful
propaganda exercise in the West Midlands this week. It would be as well
for the leadership to pay attention now to the genuine views sincerely
held by many, even if they are mostly, at present, locked away as the
secrets of ''Old'' Labour hearts.
The next Labour Government will also have some scores to settle and I
may have some news here for Burden. He can give up now any hope he might
have secretly nourished about the early chances of an office, a
ministerial box, and a car to drive it around. He has just cashed that
in for his own five minutes of fame.

ON my usual stroll through Strathclyde Park this morning (August 7) I
was struck by the ''T in the Park'' (T for trash?).
In a spirit of inquiry into the drinking habits of those who attended
this ''happening'', I perused the million cans and bottles littering the
scene of the previous night's fun: Budweiser, Buckfast, Pilsner, and
others too numerous to mention but slowly it dawned that not a can or
bottle of the sponsors' heady brew could be seen.
I admit that the spirit of inquiry did not extend to poking among the
many bodies still in restful slumber, or the broken bottles. Still,
those chaps charged with the task of gathering in the rubbish can prove
me wrong but there was little evidence of T in the park in the sense of
the amber nectar.

I DROPPED in yesterday for a chat with a constituent in his place of
work. This was no hardship since, as well as living in Skelmorlie,
Dugald Cameron is Principal of Glasgow School of Art. We took tea in his
office on an original Rennie Mackintosh table from a pot designed and
made in the school.
A guided tour was in full swing as yet another group of visitors to
the city paid homage to one of its great treasures. They were surrounded
by a stunning exhibition of works from some of its most eminent products
-- David Donaldson, Mary Armour, Joan Eardley, Ken Currie, Alison Watt
et al.
Seventy-five years of painting and 150 years of excellence in design
are being celebrated. The place was full of life as only a working
environment can be. It has 1400 students, honing their skills in every
branch of art, architecture and design -- vital components of a
civilised society.
The taxpayer gets all of this for #7.2m per year, the cost of
one-and-a-half Gazzas. That strikes me as a remarkable bargain on any
sane scale of values. Few would recognise the internationally respected
Glasgow School of Art as a prime target for public expenditure cuts.
But in the midst of that vibrant environment which he has inhabited
for 40 years, Dugald was not an entirely happy man. The Art School is
facing its worst financial crisis in modern times. Probably for the
first time in its history it has had to enforce compulsory redundancies.
Staring balefully at him from the Rennie Mackintosh table was a
newly-arrived assessment of the school's fine art department. It
concludes that the department is no more than ''satisfactory'', which is
like telling Ken Currie that he's not a bad painter.
The report is based on 11 criteria. On four, the school was found to
be excellent; four highly satisfactory; two satisfactory; and one -- the
condition of the buildings -- ''unsatisfactory''. Therefore the overall
rating can be no more than ''satisfactory'', which annoys Dugald Cameron
greatly.
For the report carries the imprimatur of the Scottish Higher Education
Funding Council and criticises the school for ''overcrowding''. It does
not seem to have occurred to the authors that (a) SHEFCO, as it is
grittily known, is responsible for funding building work or (b) that
apart from sacking more staff, the only obvious way out of the school's
financial difficulties is to overcrowd it with even more students!
SHEFCO, however, has a clear financial vision for Glasgow School of
Art. This year its funding is being cut by 3%; next year by 2.5%; the
year after by 3.75%. All very precise.
Over the past five years, the sum available for teaching each student
has already dropped by 25%. These are the figures which have created the
crisis and will inevitably lead to more cuts in tuition, given that
three-quarters of the school's costs go on staff.
Yet the sums involved are derisory. The current grief is being caused
by a deficit of under #200,000. But that is a big part of #7.2m. Perhaps
because the figures are so modest, it is easier to understand just how
mindless it is to inflict this kind of damage on our centres of
educational excellence.
As Dugald Cameron said in his recent graduation address: ''Great
damage is being done for small financial savings -- a lack of about #250
per student per year.''
What is this SHEFCO anyway? It is, of course, another quango
interposed between cuts in funding and political accountability. It is
there to implement the imperatives of a right-wing government but to
shield the architects of that philosophy from responsibility.
According to Dugald Cameron, there is a long history of good
relationships between the Scottish Office and Scotland's art colleges.
But it is a direct relationship which has now been usurped by a quango.
It's interesting to note some of the insidious ways in which
privatisation has wormed into every corner of public service. Government
used to carry its own insurance but for the past five years they Art
School has had to shell out #100,000 to insure most of its own
buildings.
They have just bought property previously occupied by Greater Glasgow
Health Board. It is no longer possible to transfer a building from one
public use to another without going through a bank. While such
arrangements take substantial chunks out of diminishing levels of
funding, who benefits from them other than banks and insurance
companies?
It is the relentless accountancy mentality which most depresses Dugald
Cameron. The architects of percentage cuts need neither know nor care
how they'll be met. It is all just an arms-length management exercise.
Dugald says: ''We feel that we are in a punishment regime, always
having to justify ourselves. Somehow we have to recapture the idea of
education being a public enterprise without which the country goes
nowhere.''
In the past there was, and in the future there surely will be, a will
to help even when money was short; to find ways round problems, to stave
off the foolish consequences of cuts that are costly to society in any
terms other than the crudest.
When I got home from the School of Art, I learned that a single
director of an electricity company had yesterday cashed in almost
#900,000 worth of share options -- more than quadruple the cut which
Glasgow School of Art is obliged to make this year. That is the kind of
comparison and perspective which must be laid repeatedly at Tory doors.
Perhaps, though, Dugald Cameron should just invite Michael Forsyth, in
his new role as Scotland's protector against the Tories, through for a
cup of tea and a listening session. That might solve the problem. On the
other hand, Forsyth might advise him to sell the table.

FROM the point of view of the Labour leadership the remnants of
old-guard socialism must be irritating in the extreme. The row over the
manner in which Mr Blair appears to be leading his party to victory at
the next General Election is one of these desperately intractable ones
in which Labour specialises. It is all about soul. The soul, to be
specific, of the Labour Party. The soul of the Labour Party is a
hard-boiled article which has been kicked around for so many decades
that it has taken on the semblance of a battered Holy Grail: that is,
nobody can find it but everyone believes that it is within their grasp.
If the Labour Party really wants to win the next election it would be
better to stop searching for this mythical object and concentrate on the
preparation of policies and, most importantly, the task of relaying them
to the electorate. This will be seen as unfair by the old-guard because
they believe that without its soul the Labour Party cannot and should
not win the election.
On the other hand Mr Blair and his modernisers are far too dismissive
of some of the traditional aspects of socialism which are dear to the
hearts of the old guard. Mr Blair has obviously arrived at the notion
that his party is so inherently prone to factionalism that only the
strongest of hands can lead it. This has led him to rap their knuckles
too hard and too frequently. It is true that the temptation to assault
Mr Richard Burden MP with a solid object must be overwhelming. Anyone
who compares the actions of his own party to those of the former
communist regimes in Europe has no business in politics because he
clearly has no understanding of the subject. Nevertheless, it would be
helpful if Mr Blair could expand a little on his remarks about society
and caring. It is true that New Labour's best chance of winning the next
election lies in adopting the colours of European social democracy but
that alone is not sufficient. It is possible to be economically prudent
and socially radical and if there is one message coming from the
electorate it is the confirmation of the attractiveness of this
combination. It will not be easy to achieve, but if Mr Blair is to
succeed he must draw the electorate towards it, together with the
members of his own party.

AS the long, hot summer turns into a paradise for parasites, parents
will need to be extra vigilant for head lice with a reduced role for the
school ''nit nurse''. Each single louse can produce 10 new nits a day
and the symptom of 1930s poverty appears to be making a comeback.
The Health Education Board for Scotland has produced a leaflet
advising parents how to combat the tiny bloodsuckers who thrive in the
warmth and spread rapidly. Thoroughgoing weekly checks of children's
hair are recommended, with a fine-tooth comb inspection after washing.
''Detector'' combs can be bought at chemists, along with special
lotions, if lice are found. Head Lice -- Getting Rid of a Nuisance is
produced by the Health Education Board at Woodburn House, Canaan Lane,
Edinburgh EH10 4SG.
* FIRST came the Three Kings bearing gifts, then the Three Stooges --
now the Three Cones are achieving celebrity status.
Overseas visitors alighting at Haymarket Station for the Festival may
wonder if the trio -- strategically located in front of the exit -- have
some mystical significance, a Gaelic greeting perhaps? Or a David Mach?
But thousands of daily commuters who've jostled to avoid the cones for
the past six months have no such illusions: they're as much a menace as
the uneven forecourt paving they've been guarding most of the year.
ScotRail say their staff have been abused by indignant passengers, but
claim it's up to Railtrack to repair the paving and remove the
obstructions. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents frets
that one dark night yobs could kidnap the cones and someone will take a
nasty spill: in that event the injured party seems well placed to press
a claim for compensation.
Meantime, to the horror of regulars, the cones appear to be cloning --
two smaller ones have now taken up station nearby. Draconian measures
are clearly called for, preferably before the Three Kings return . . .
* MOBILE phone companies were accused of exploiting women's fears to
sell them portables; but Glasgow's violent weekend certainly brought
home the value of a mobile in an emergency. Unfortunately, fears about
runaway charges -- reinforced by a critical Which? report -- are almost
as daunting.
Check-Out asked Cellnet if a 999-only phone, with reduced monthly
subscriptions, isn't long overdue. It seems some manufacturers are
sympathetic to the idea.
Meantime, anyone who feels unable to resist the temptation to make
expensive calls and simply wants to guarantee themselves, a child or
elderly relative, instant access to the emergency services, is
recommended to consider a ''peace of mind'' PIN phone.
Only 999 calls (free) operate without keying in the PIN -- forget to
memorise it or hand it over, and for around #3 a week the phone will
reach police, fire and ambulance wherever the user happens to be.
Remember, though, the Which? warning to study contracts carefully before
signing up.
AN International Festival hotline is taking orders for ''distinctive''
gifts for those unable to get to gift shops at 21 Market Street and the
Highland Tollbooth, Castle Hill, Edinburgh. T-shirts, Spirit of the
Festival 12-year-old malt, silk ties, jewellery, scarves, and a festival
bear are among items that can be ordered on 0131-467 8727. Post/packing
is #1.50 per item.
ScotRail has gone into partnership with arts entrepreneur Richard
Demarco in an ambitious plan to take the Festival Fringe to Dundee by
train.
In an exclusive ticketing arrangement Fringe audiences will be able to
travel to the City of Discovery between August 10 and 26 and gain entry
to one of the most exciting Fringe performances.
The Demarco European Art Foundation has brought together a thrilling
programme from Lithuania, Hungary, Latvia and Scotland and the
all-inclusive ticket includes entry to a day of art and theatre at the
world-famous Dundee Repertory Theatre.
All-inclusive tickets, costing #22, from the Fringe Box Office, The
Demarco Gallery, and Dundee Rep.
Three's a crowd: the Haymarket Station cones stand guard.

CLARE HENRY finds the director of Glasgow Print Studio unfazed after
organising a Festival exhibition in one week.
MOHAMMED and the Mountain? Glasgow Print Studio at the Edinburgh
Festival? John Mackechnie, director, takes a pragmatic view. ''It's well
worth while -- even at very short notice. This will be our third year.
Our location in George Street, by Charlotte Square, is perfect. It gives
us the opportunity to meet a whole different range of people: local
Edinburgh collectors as well as visitors and tourists. With the book
fair on nearby this summer we expect to be extra busy.''
Mackechnie was his customary cool, calm, laid-back self -- no sign of
panic, although he had exactly seven days warning in which to move to
Edinburgh and produce a four-week show. But then he's used to mounting
Scottish exhibitions in Los Angeles, Berlin, and Moscow, so takes
Edinburgh in his stride.
''There was a question mark over the space. We had it confirmed at the
weekend.''
Ewan Mundy and his brother Graeme are joining the print studio, as
they did last year, which splits the #1000 a week rent three ways. With
telephone and insurance and everything else, it will cost #6000, or
#2000 each.
''It pays off. We get great feedback over the following 12 months. At
Mayfest we sold two Neil Macpherson oils to someone we met last
Festival. That's the bonus!''
Ewan Mundy agrees. ''We're really pleased to be going to the Festival.
We're taking a range of pictures from a major 1890s George Henry Glasgow
Boys picture to Gary Anderson's new 1995 piece to flag up his November
show. There's also work by William Crosbie who is 80 in September. It's
just 60 years since he left Glasgow Art School. And we're taking
Cadell's stylish New Town interiors back to the New Town!''
The Edinburgh venue, 137 George Street, used to be the Fine Art
Society's gallery so is very smart both inside and out, the dark forest
green ideal for pictures. ''It's been shut since last August so our
names are still on the window!'' laughs Mackechnie.
As though seven days is not brief enough, Ewan Mundy has a major
openingin Glasgow today: 40 top-class Peploe and Fergusson Colourist
pictures, so although Edinburgh's doors open at 10am on Monday, the
party is slightly delayed to let the workers get their breath.
Back in Glasgow the print studio also has two brand-new shows:
internationalist Christopher Le Brun and, in the Original Print Shop, a
lively show of very buyable work from #25 up, of prints On A Glasgow
Theme, both till September 2.
I first met the painter Le Brun in 1981 in London and in 1983
facilitated his first sortie into printmaking. As a judge for the 1983
Gulbenkian Foundation Print Commission Award, along with Robert Hopper,
now director of the Henry Moore Institute, I voted for Le Brun. We had
to select someone who had never made prints but whom we reckoned should.
Inspired by the music, poetry, and painting of the 1880s, especially
by Redon, Puvis de Chavannes, and Gustave Moreau, Le Brun became a
leading figure in 1980s painting. Now 45, a trustee of the Tate Gallery,
and with a string of major international exhibitions to his name, this
is his overdue Glasgow debut.
Le Brun is a Romantic painter in the true sense of the word: his
theatrical, symbolist bent epitomised by white, winged horses, full
moons, gloomy cypress trees, dense forests, plus hero and heroine.
Cliched? Perhaps, but glorious too, and technically superb, with full
painterly panache.
However, these motifs also provide a starting point for abstraction.
In new huge coloured 8ft monoprints made specially for the Glasgow show,
he pushes the image into a ghostly concoction of cross-laced webs and
shadowy shapes where a tree becomes a lance, a horse transforms into a
monster.
The interplay between his painting and prints is especially evident in
these big new monotypes which include an impressive 7ft Brunnhilde
created at the Tullis Workshop in the US. Le Brun uses oil paints on
wood and heavy, really thick handmade paper which is then put through a
hydraulic press to get rich, saturated hues.
Prints done specially for the Glasgow Theme show are among the best,
vide Ian McNicholl, Gerry Giblin, and Alan Beveridge, all new to me.
McNicholl's detailed, etched Hatrack Building (a snip at #90) is a
tour de force. I'm also impressed by his Bay Windows, where he's used
woodcut to make a strong black and white design which also works as a
familiar image. Giblin favours 1930s art deco, with a stylish Beresford
Hotel and Taite's Tower, while Beveridge (from Edinburgh no less) gives
us a fine Finneston Quay and Glasgow Green Fountain.
George Todd tackles the architectually complex St Vincent Street
Church. Harry McGee is a dab hand at a romantic misty Clyde with its
cranes and towers. Both Sue Mackechnie and Jonathan Robertson use colour
to advantage and I'm glad to see my favourite John Mackechnie Kibble
Palace colour etchings once more. They stand the test of time.

Susan Raven describes how actress Lisa Daniely dramatically relives
the rags to riches to tragedy story of a heroine of the French
Revolution
THE French Revolution threw up a prodigious array of women heroines --
rabble-rousers, feminists, thinkers, politicians, fighters: some famous
like Charlotte Corday and Manon Roland, others less so but who still
played a significant part in that extraordinary time.
One of the most dazzling of these shooting stars was a young peasant
woman from the countryside near Liege in Belgium, who became known as
Theroigne de Mericourt. It is round her life that the actress Lisa
Daniely has written a one-woman show called Snakes About Her Cradle
(Pleasance, August 9-September 2).
Daniely -- a cult figure among movie buffs for films like Lilli
Marlene and Hindle Wakes, and her early TV appearances -- had already
had some experience writing storylines and scripts for television. ''If
you have imaginative juices whirring around inside you, they rot if you
don't use them. I was drawn to the French Revolution as a subject for a
one-woman show, partly because of the bi-centenary, but mostly because I
spent 10 years of my childhood in Paris.'' Her father was legal adviser
to the British Embassy.
''Somebody put me on to Theroigne, and I went to the British Museum in
pursuit. There were several nineteenth-century books on her -- but most
important, I discovered the evidence of the doctor who treated her in
the asylum where she lived for the last years of her life. I use his
words as the epilogue -- it's the only part of the play not spoken or
sung by me.
''Theroigne was from a poor Belgian peasant family, but her mother
died when she was five and between an aunt, a convent, her stepmother,
and her grandparents she had a truly wretched childhood.
''But she had the luck when she was 16 to become a servant to a rich
woman, Madame Colbert, who took a shine to her, and taught her to read
and write, to play music and sing.'' Taking Theroigne with them, the
Colbert family went to London on a visit, during which they met the
Prince of Wales and Theroigne acquired her first admirers.
One of those admirers left her a lot of money, which enabled her, in
her twenties, to establish herself as a courtesan in pre-Revolutionary
Paris: ''not a prostitute'', says Daniely.
1789 was a truly thrilling experience for her. She was one of the
generation of whom Wordsworth wrote, ''Bliss was it in that dawn to be
alive, and to be young was very heaven.'' She was an extremely pretty
woman, and bold and stylish -- she soon adopted a red riding habit as
her usual costume, and was recognised wherever she went.
She was not present at the Fall of the Bastille, and was not among the
army of women who forced the King and Queen to leave Versailles and
return to Paris; but she was from the beginning a passionate follower of
the debates in the National Assembly -- and even joined in from the
public gallery. On August 26 she was present at the reading of the
Declaration of Human Rights, and she created a kind of salon in her
hotel, where the leading politicians could meet after debates.
''She was obviously enormously captivating and a very eloquent public
speaker,'' says Daniely. By November 1789 she was the object of the
first of many scurrilous attacks in the royalist press, and by the
following August there was a warrant out for her arrest.
So she retired to her native Belgium -- where her fame had preceded
her. She found herself arrested as a possible danger to the imperial
forces, which were gathering outside France in support of Louis XVI. She
was eventually released for lack of evidence; but it was during her time
in prison in Austria and Germany that she wrote the ''confessions'' on
which Daniely has based part of her play.
There are plenty of other sources, of course, including two of
Theroigne's own speeches: for, once back in Paris in January 1792, she
took a conspicuous part in the unfolding drama of the Revolution. In
February she addressed the Jacobin club on her experiences in prison.
In March she gave a speech urging the need for armies of ''Amazons''
(she was among those who wanted women to be given arms to fight the
enemies of France). In April she persuaded the painter David to put on a
Festival of Liberty.
In June, she helped organise the insurrection which would finally
bring down the monarchy; and in August she took part in the capture of
the Tuileries (the Royal Palace), inciting the mob to kill those who
stood in their way.
But her days of fame and glory were soon over. ''She was an
increasingly isolated figure,'' says Daniely. ''She claimed to be a
heroine of the Revolution -- and she was; she claimed to be an
inspiration to the people -- and she was; but she was already being
derided as an irrelevance by her political allies.''
She appeared a charismatic figure in her riding clothes and with
feathers in her hat, and seemed to acquire importance by the insults and
caricatures of the royalist press. But it was an illusion.
She was lonely, getting very short of money, and probably beginning to
go mad. Worse was to follow. In 1793 she was publicly humiliated by the
Jacobin women whom she must once have looked upon as sisters: outside
the Convention they lifted her skirts and whipped her backside.
Within a year she was acknowledged to be mentally ill, and between
1797 and her death in 1817 she was locked in asylums. Some of Daniely's
most moving passages are from the reports on her when she was in the
notorious Salpetriere.
''But I don't want anyone to think this is a gloomy play,'' says the
author. ''A lot of it is light-hearted and funny, even farcical, and
there is plenty of music and a couple of songs. Also, it's quite
exciting. Theroigne was all right until events pushed her too far. She
receded into madness as an escape.''
Daniely has received #1000 from Waterstone's -- she ran the poetry
department in one of their London bookshops for four years -- and the
other #3000 she has raised herself.
''I'll scrape by. My director David McGillivray, the designer Allison
Bock, and the composer Conrad Nelson are all friends and have worked for
free. The music has been pre-recorded but I've taken a flat in Edinburgh
and David and Allison are coming to stay.''
Daniely is not the first stage actress to relish the role of
Theroigne: she inspired many romances and plays in late
nineteenth-century France, and the celebrated Sarah Bernhardt
commissioned a play in six acts from an academician. She appeared with a
huge number of extras. ''My play is not like that,'' says Daniely. ''For
one thing, it only lasts an hour.''

Allan Laing finds the prospect of a long weekend of extra-terrestrial
television just out of this world.
AS anyone who has stood in the taxi rank at Central Station around
midnight on a Fair Friday will confirm, Glasgow is no stranger to
science fiction. There you will see the weirdest of creations -- funny
little men with green faces, ladies of indeterminate shape in peculiar
outfits which are not of this planet, and -- most curious of all -- a
strange language which must sound like fluent Zogg to the stone-cold
sober. It is life, Jimmy, but not as we know it. At least, not without
10 pints of lager down our throats.
This is perhaps why it was a Glasgow-based production company, more
familiar with the making of current affairs programmes, which came up
with the idea for an entire bank holiday weekend of extra-terrestrial
television on Channel Four. Kirsty Wark and Alan Clements (for it was
they) must have stood in that aforementioned taxi queue and discovered a
brave new world.
C4, of course, are the masters of the universe when it comes to
seasons and weekends of themed programmes. Recently they went all
glitter-and-Gary as they celebrated the Glam Rock of the Seventies. And
how could we, not to mention the Viewers and Listeners Association,
forget their provocative forey into the Red Light Zone with a selection
of risque delights designed to get the old nostrils flaring?
This time round the zone is a tad more twilight than crimson with C4
boldly going where no station has gone before to celebrate the warped
factor. Three Earth days of flying saucers, scary monsters, and all
manner of interplanetary hokum. From Doctor Who and the Daleks to
Babylon Five; from Biker Mice From Mars to Mork and Mindy; from I
Married A Monster From Outer Space to Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters.
It's television, Jim, but not necessarily as we want it.
And yet, by all accounts, science fiction is enjoying something of a
boom in popularity these days. The anorak is in the process of being
unzipped. Suddenly SF is becoming respectable. It is no longer the
exclusive province of the very sad and the very lonely (who, in the
privacy of their own starships, dress up as Captain Kirk and Lt Uhuru).
Now it's chic to dig Outer Space.
A recent survey by New York's SF TV channel suggested that 12 million
viewers turned on to SF every week while a further three million rented
SF videos. SF books topped two million in UK sales last year, making it
the second most popular literary genre (romantic fiction comes out on
top).
Hollywood, whose job it is to tap in to popular culture and do it to
death, has decided that SF is this year's model, with movies like Judge
Dredd, Batman Forever, Waterworld, and Keanu Reeves's forthcoming
cyber-punk epic Johnny Mnemonic.
For C4's weekend, Glasgow has been chosen as Satellite City. Spookily,
the TV event coincides with Intersection, apparently the world's biggest
annual gathering of sci-fi buffs. As many as 5000 weird and wonderful
enthusiasts are expected to park their space craft outside the Scottish
Exhibition and Conference Centre for the duration.
It was the prospect of this convention which persuaded Wark-Clements
to make the somewhat unconventional proposal for, not only a programme
from them about Intersection, but also an entire weekend of SF for C4.
Fortunately, the station's Commissioning Editor, Stuart Cosgrove, is a
St Johnstone fan and therefore no stranger to out-of-this-world
experiences. He liked the idea.
The Wark-Clement programme, Beam Me Up, Scotty (apparently a reference
to some obscure SF television series of the sixties) will report from
the Glasgow conference with Red Dwarf star Craig Charles seeking to
discover, not only the secrets of the universe, but also the far more
challenging question of why grown men and women like to dress up as
Klingons and parade about in public. The answer may well come from
Roseanna Cunningham, recently-elected Nationalist MP and self-confessed
Trekkie.
Programme producer Clair Birnie explained: ''I think it was Alan
(Clements) who came up with the idea. He knew the conference was taking
place and decided to pitch it to C4. We're delighted that the weekend is
going ahead and that we are part of it. It's good for Wark Clements to
be doing something which is not current affairs.''
The SF weekend, in addition to movies and serials, will also feature
several documentaries including an Equinox Special, The Real X-Files,
which investigates the apparent use of psychic powers by the CIA as a
weapon in the cold war; and a Secret History Special, The Roswell
Incident, which examines the story of a mysterious space craft which
crashed in the New Mexican desert in 1947.
* Channel Four's Sci-Fi Weekend runs from August 26 to 28.

* THE curtain goes up this weekend on the greatest arts show on earth
-- thousands of performers, from world superstars to student hopefuls,
have been converging on the capital for the Edinburgh International
Festival, its associated Fringe, film, books and jazz jamborees.
They are all looking for personal satisfaction and audience
appreciation -- and most are looking for critical acclaim. And this
year, for the first time, that acclaim can take distinctive shape, in
the shape of Herald awards that will be among the most coveted on the
circuit.
The Herald Angel -- which has received the blessing of Prince Edward
-- is an imposing statuette, a gilded bewinged figure on a polished elm
plinth, an eloquent witness to the soaring performance of its recipient.
In contrast, the Little Devil is less a fallen angel than a fallen-over
angel -- a figure of mischief rather than malice. Coal black and dumpy,
he will be granted to those on whom fortune has snarled, in recognition
of their fortitude.
At the end of each week of this year's Festival, The Herald will
present two of these covetable figurines to examples of Edinburgh
excellence over the previous seven days. Next Saturday, internationally
renowned actress Janet Suzman will present the first four awards -- two
Angels and two Devils -- at a glittering ceremony at the Festival
Theatre.
There are no rules about who may embrace an angel -- the only
qualification is that their work has impressed The Herald's team of
writers and reviewers, whether in the ''official'' Festival or the
Fringe; in an art exhibition; in film and book festivals. They may go to
an individual, a group, an organisation, a venue. For Edinburgh's newest
and most comprehensive award, anything is possible.
Yet for every glittering success story, the world's biggest arts
festival always has a parallel tale of woe. Two Little Devils will be
awarded as a consolation prize to those for whom the fates have not been
so kind. The Little Devil is an acknowledgment of a terrible reality; if
things can go wrong, they will.
Examples? The opera which failed to start because a principal singer
had fallen asleep in his hotel room. The naked landlord who refused to
leave the living-room he'd leased to a Glasgow theatre company as a
dormitory for their actresses -- a Little Devil recognises the problems
and the sacrifices.
Both the Herald Angels and the Little Devils have been designed and
made in Granton by sculptor Allan Ross.

Ken Gallacher writes that if Rangers fails to secure victory in Cyprus
and join Europe's elite rich clubs it will hurt more than the Ibrox
side's pride.
AS RANGERS contemplate their visit to the dust-bowl pitch at Larnaca
which will decide their European Cup fate for another year, the club's
accountants must have been poring over the projected accounts for the
season ahead.
Ibrox supremo David Murray remains insistent that when he sets out the
budget for the club each year he does so assuming they will play only
one round in Europe -- all that is guaranteed when the draws are made
for the various UEFA tournaments.
But there is no doubt that this time round, after two seasons in the
wilderness, Murray and everyone else at Ibrox hope to be sitting at the
big table with the major players when the Champions' League is completed
in two weeks' time.
The money on offer to any club is staggering, but for Rangers, who
seem able to sell out Ibrox even when a game is live on television, the
stakes are even higher.
Rangers' season-ticket holders were allowed into the opening European
game for nothing, but others had to pay more than #20 for a seat in the
main stand or in the Upper Deck.
A repeat of that -- given the revenue generated by the Ibrox boxes and
the fast food outlets -- when everyone has to buy a ticket for three
home games would bring Rangers in about #3m.
On top of that, UEFA will give a hand-out of just over #lm to each
team taking part in the Champions' League format.
In addition, the teams will share in a television jackpot of a further
#10m and if Rangers are involved their portion of that could be about
#750,000.
Then there is the payment-for-points arrangement which may be slightly
amended this season because three points will be awarded for each win.
However, that could still mean #500,000 for every win in the group
games.
Then, if the Scottish champions were to reach the quarter finals --
and the one time they appeared in the Champions' League they were second
in their section -- a further #1.5m is immediately payable from UEFA,
plus another #1m home gate and further television cash.
In essence, a result in Cyprus, would hand Rangers a minimum of #5m,
even if they didn't collect a single point from their group matches.
If they went further, then the cash available would exceed even David
Murray's wildest dreams.
A spokesman for UEFA pointed out last night: ''A team which goes all
the way to the final would stand to make close to #10m from the various
monies we would pay out. That would not include any gate money at all.
''This is the kind of money which is now at stake for the clubs who
are successful in Europe. The Champions' League has been a huge
money-spinner and has drawn massive television audiences throughout
Europe.
''We are happy with the present format although we realise that some
of the ambitious clubs can always find themselves sitting on the
sidelines when the glamorous games are taking place.''
Rangers, for the past two years, have been among the envious
onlookers. Now they travel to Cyprus with just a single goal to show for
their efforts at Ibrox.
However, there is little doubt that the players will recognise the
enormous problems that defeat would bring.
If the top club in Scotland -- a club with ambitions which lie well
beyond our own Premier League -- fail to join Europe's elite yet again
then an Ibrox rethink could be necessary.
Certainly Murray could not continue to countenance millions of pounds
being spent each summer without the pay-off that Europe and Europe alone
can bring.
This time it seemed that the #9m which was splashed out in the close
season would give Rangers the on-field clout to carry them to European
glory as well as what seems to be inevitable success at home.
With or without the money, Rangers want desperately to be recognised
as one of Europe's leading clubs. Prestige as well as finance is
involved in this epic search for a place in the Champions' League.
Other clubs face similar problems. Belgian champions Anderlecht lost
at home to Ferencvaros of Hungary the other night, Dynamo Kiev could
only win 1-0 against Aalborg of Denmark, and other results certainly
suggest that the riches on offer have spurred the minnows to greater
efforts,
Meanwhile, of course, the privileged clubs, those from the countries
with the biggest TV audiences, are spared the agonies of the preliminary
round games. Blackburn Rovers have no European pedigree at all, unless
you count their disastrous defeat by a team of Swedish part-timers last
season as something to be proud of.
Yet UEFA decreed before the European Cup Final in Vienna that the
English champions would play in the Champions' League. If Ajax had lost
in that final then they would be scrambling around just as Rangers and
the others are doing to qualify for the big time.
Rangers, or any other team who wins the championship here, will face
the chilling prospect of qualification every season. Money talks, and
there is not enough in Scotland to give the powerful men of UEFA the
guarantees they need.
If Rangers fail this time then their long-term strategies will be
affected. While the majority of their support will remain content with
the 10-in-a-row title target insiders will realise that they are moving
further and further away from the power base in Europe that has to be
their major aim.

Preaching family values has exposed Newt Gingrich to allegations
which, only embarrassing now, could prove more costly if he decides to
run for President, reports Patrick Brogan.
THE latest sex scandal in Washington, involving 20-year-old
allegations against Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House of
Representatives, first surfaced early this week. It has had a brisk
two-day run in the tabloids, and has now reached the stage where it
needs new material. Without some new element to feed on, it would
normally sink beneath the waves.
So far, the story has been firmly ignored by the respectable press.
The New York Times, the Washington Post, and others like them, have made
no reference to the story at all. It is too sleazy, beneath their
dignity.
The tabloids and radio shows are far less restrained. As soon as the
story broke, in the pages of the fashion-cum-literary magazine Vanity
Fair, it was splashed all over the New York Post, the New York Daily
News, and their ilk. Sex, as ever, sells -- even when the story casts a
stain on the papers' hero.
After the excesses of reporting similar allegations against Bill
Clinton during the 1992 election, and again last year, this is about par
for the course. It is really nobody's business except the people
involved if Gingrich had an affair with someone in 1974, or 1977 -- any
more than it should concern anyone else that Bill Clinton may have had a
liaison with Jennifer Flowers or Paula Jones.
So the posh papers and the network TV news ignore the story, while the
tabs plunge in. Thus the Sun in London will publish any scandal about a
member of the Government, even though the report damages the Government
the Sun has constantly supported and helps the Labour Party it has
equally constantly opposed. Sex, and sales, are more important than
political principle.
The only justification for publishing such stuff is that
politician-adulterers ought not to trumpet family values while betraying
them in their private lives. That is the line taken sanctimoniously by a
number of publications, but it is not at all clear that the American
public agrees.
Ronald Reagan was insistently and flagrantly hypocritical about sexual
morality and family values. He was the first President to be divorced,
and he spent most of his career in Hollywood, the least ''family''
oriented place on earth. What is more, he and his wife Nancy treated his
children by his first wife with a calculated coldness and indifference
that hardly bears looking at.
Nobody minded. Americans apparently can forgive hypocrisy in their
leaders. Reagan was even allowed to proclaim his devotion to the
right-to-life movement, even though he had signed the most liberal
abortion law in the country, while governor of California.
The three front-runners among the candidates for the Republican
presidential nomination next year, all fervent supporters of ''family
values'', are all divorced: Senators Bob Dole and Phil Gramm, and the
governor of California, Pete Wilson. Back in 1963, Nelson Rockefeller
lost all his chances for the Republican nomination by getting a divorce
and remarrying. Perhaps times have changed. Perhaps he would have done
better if he had done what Reagan, Gingrich, and all the others have
done ever since, insistently proclaimed their devotion to family values
without embarrassment.
At any event, those right-wing Christians who took great, lip-smacking
pleasure in denouncing Bill Clinton for his alleged indiscretions are
now faced with very similar allegations against the Speaker. Vanity Fair
describes a number of incidents, including one that is very like the
Paula Jones affair, complete with a lady who has suddenly concluded that
the Congressman doesn't deserve his high position.
For the moment, this won't hurt Gingrich. He is not running for
President -- yet. His power base is the House of Representatives, and
no-one there is going to challenge his morality.
Things would be different if he decided to throw his hat into the ring
and run for President. He has not ruled it out, and has promised that he
will make a final decision by December 15. That is very late in the game
for ordinary politicians, but Gingrich assumes that he is different,
that he could raise the necessary money in a hurry -- and he would only
try if it were fairly clear that Dole, Gramm, and all the others were
not likely to beat Bill Clinton in 1996.
If he does run, he will have to answer all the excruciatingly
embarrassing questions that faced Bill Clinton. At the moment, there is
just one lady who has made allegations against him, of events that she
says happened in the 1970s. Some people who worked in his various
congressional election campaigns in those years have made less specific
allegations, meaning they have not named the ladies.
No doubt, if Gingrich runs for President, those other names will
surface, and there may be yet more, more recent. Perhaps he could cut a
deal with the President, that such matters are nothing whatever to do
with who should be elected President, and drop the subject -- but it
might be more difficult to persuade tabloid reporters to turn their
attention to serious matters.
There has been a steady deterioration of political debate in the
United States in the past 20 years, and it is not all the fault of the
press or even television. Politicians and campaign consultants have
found that negative advertising works. That is, they win elections by
accusing their opponents of every imaginable crime.
In 1988, George Bush broadcast television commercials alleging that
Michael Dukakis let black rapists out of jail so that they could rape
again. He won. Conservative candidates constantly accuse their opponents
of being soft on criminals, wanting to raise taxes, and to corrupt youth
with pornography and rap music.
Clinton was under sustained attack for his alleged sexual misdeeds.
Now it will be Gingrich's turn. It's not easy to feel sorry for him --
but politics would be a more respectable trade if such matters were kept
out of the public view.

<HEADLINE>BR to see confidential school records. Fall boy sues for #150,000</HEADLINE>

A TEENAGER who suffered extensive burns at the age of 12 when he fell
on to overhead electric cables on a railway line is suing British Rail
for #150,000.
Martin McLeod, now 16, claims that after the accident he suffered a
personality change which caused serious disruption to his schooling.
British Rail, which denies responsibility, alleges that Martin had
shown behaviour and truancy problems at Wellington School, Greenock,
before his accident.
A Court of Session judge has now allowed BR access to Martin's school
records, despite opposition from Strathclyde Regional Council, the
education authority.
Martin slipped from a pipe spanning a railway embankment near his home
at Woodstock Road, Greenock, in June 1991. He was halfway across the
pipe when he lost his footing and fell on to live cables. He blames
British Rail for his injuries, alleging that a section of the rail
embankment near his home was not fenced properly.
He spent about nine months in hospital because of his injuries.
Martin claims that after the accident he changed from being a happy
and communicative child to a withdrawn personality, with few friends.
In his damages action, he alleges that his accident seriously
disrupted his education and that he was reported to the Children's Panel
for truancy.
BR asked Lord Gill for an order allowing access to excerpts from
Martin's school record, showing the type and extent of any behavioural
problems from August 1990, before his accident.
Strathclyde Region argued that the school records were confidential,
and in terms of court rules placed the disputed documents in a sealed
envelope.
The region claimed that, for it to function effectively as an
education authority, it was essential for school records to be protected
by confidentiality.
BR asked the judge for permission for the envelope to be opened up, on
the basis that it must have access to the contents to respond to the
claims that Martin's education had been seriously disrupted because of
the accident.
Lord Gill said that it was obvious that records of this kind might be
confidential, but in this case they were directly relevant to the issue
raised. In these circumstances, it was up to Strathclyde to show a
convincing reason for the evidence contained in the records to be
excluded.
In a previous case it had been decided that the public interest in
seeing that justice was done far outweighed the public interest in
confidentiality.
In this case it was agreed that questions over the cause and effect of
Martin's behavioural problems had a significant bearing on damages.
''If it is the case that such problems predated the accident, justice
requires that British Rail should be given a proper opportunity to prove
the point. They cannot hope to do so effectively unless they have access
to the documents.
''In my view such access must also be regarded as necessary for the
proper determination of the case. For these reasons I consider that
British Rail's need for access to these documents outweighs the claim
for confidentiality.''
Lord Gill ruled that the confidential records should be opened up, and
appointed an advocate to view their contents and make excerpts from
documents relevant to the case.

THE man dubbed the father of the ''family from hell'' is to stand
trial for allegedly refusing to give a breath test.
Mr Gordon Graham, 40, of North Street, Rosehearty, denies failing to
provide the test when stopped by police last month in the Aberdeenshire
fishing village.
Trial was set at Peterhead Sheriff Court yesterday for September 14.
Earlier this year, the Graham family were evicted from a council house
in Glenrothes after locals became fed up with their anti-social
behaviour.
In April, Mr Graham, his wife, Anne, three of their teenage daughters,
and one grandchild moved in a caravan to Aberdeen.
They stayed for a short time with relatives in the city before renting
a cottage in the village on the Moray coast.

<HEADLINE>Learning the facts of life in school does not lead youngsters to become promiscuous. Survey 'clears' sex education</HEADLINE>

A MAJOR survey is claimed to refute accusations that sex education in
schools encourages early sexual experience by teenagers.
It shows that the average young person in the UK is likely to have had
their first sexual encounter by the age of 17 -- four years earlier than
their grandparents' generation 40 years before.
However, young people who said they had learned the facts of life in
the classroom rather than from friends were less likely to have had sex
before 16, the age of consent. They were also more likely to have used
contraception when they did have intercourse for the first time.
The findings, published today in the British Medical Journal, emerge
from a national survey of the sexual habits and lifestyles of nearly
19,000 people aged from 16 to 59.
The survey was carried out by Social and Community Planning Research
for a consortium of medical and academic organisations. One of the
consortium's concerns when it embarked on the survey was to get a
clearer picture of the potential spread of HIV.
However, when it began to organise the survey six years ago the then
Prime Minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, vetoed Health Department funding
for it and the group had to make up the gap elsewhere.
Mrs Thatcher was said at the time to have regarded the survey as
offensive and an intrusion into privacy.
The results help to make sense of the poet Philip Larkin's observation
that ''sexual intercourse began in 1963''. Teenage sex for men was
starting to dawn in 1955, when the average age at first encounter was
18, and for women in 1970, when the average age was 19.
For the oldest generation who took part, aged 55-59, the average age
for first sex was 20 for men and 21 for women.
The increase in the numbers admitting to have had sex before the age
16 is also striking. For women that rose from 0.8% among 55-59 year-olds
to 18.7% among today's 16-19 year-olds. For men the proportion rose from
5.8% to 27.6%.
The report says that school-based sex education lessons are not the
main source of information for most people -- the majority still gained
their sexual knowledge from friends, although this pattern was becoming
less strong among younger people.
The number citing parents as the source increased among the young, but
the overall proportion remained low, with fathers even less likely to be
cited than mothers.
No other source of information, including the print and broadcasting
media, was cited as the main source by more than 5% of respondents.
Despite the assumed sexual sophistication of the young, two-thirds of
all those interviewed considered themselves ill-informed about sexual
matters at the time of first intercourse, and a third of the women and
half the men would have liked more information from school.
One of the researchers involved in the study, Dr Kaye Wellings, a
senior lecturer in the department of public health at the London School
of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said yesterday: ''Opponents of sex
education in schools often hold such lessons responsible for early
sexual activity.
''This study shows that those for whom school is the main source of
information about sexual matters are no more likely to have had
intercourse before the age of 16 than those citing other main sources.''

<HEADLINE>Fish stocks replenished by successful curb on catches</HEADLINE>

A CAMPAIGN led by the Prince of Wales to let salmon catches off the
hook has reversed the decline of stocks on his favourite Highland river.
The success of the campaign means more time is being sought for
anglers on the River Dee.
The Prince will be given a first-hand account of the success of the
scheme when he joins the Queen at Balmoral later this month.
Strict conservation measures were introduced on the River Dee after a
dramatic fall in the number of fish over four years. But stocks have
recovered sufficiently to allow the fishing season to be extended.
The Dee District Salmon Fishery Board has applied to Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth for a two-week extension on beats below
Banchory.
''The scientists have told us that there will be enough fish in the
late runs that are surplus to spawning requirements,'' board chairman
Colonel Robert Campbell said.
''Therefore exploitation of these stocks will be perfectly legitimate.
But it does depend on the Secretary of State's approval.''
The fishing season will still be two weeks shorter than usual, as
normally it would go on until the end of October.
Although no catches will be permitted in February next year, Colonel
Campbell is pleased with the progress so far.
''There is absolutely no doubt that our conservation scheme has been a
tremendous success,'' he said.
The Prince attended a meeting of the board last year to lend support
to the measures.
One of its prime moves was to urge anglers to keep only one fish and
to return other catches to the river.
Colonel Campbell said: ''Catch returns show that of the 1978 fish
caught 1186 were put back.''

WHAT is a victim? I used to think I knew. I used to think the meaning
of the word had both passive and active components: you could be a
victim of someone else's actions, and you could be a victim of your own.
The English language has dedicated a series of aphorisms to the idea
that personal carelessness or self-inflicted misfortune are commonplace
tripwires on life's rocky road. ''There's many a slip 'twixt cup and
lip,'' we are warned at the maternal knee. Or more severely: ''Pride
cometh before a fall.''
These days, however, if the cup slips on its route to the lip or you
overestimate your own abilities and come a cropper, you need a lawyer.
In America, a woman orders a cup of coffee at a McDonald's drive-in and
drops it in her lap. She drops it, McDonald's picks up the bill:
$600,000 personal injury compensation for burns received. In England, a
shopper over-reaches herself in a supermarket and dislodges a tin. It
falls on her head, doing small, temporary damage, and the supermarket
coughs up #900. Her lawyer claims the tins have been ''badly stacked''.
A man disabled when larking about on a bouncy castle sues the
manufacturers for not warning him that their product is unsuitable for
adults and is awarded #1m . . . two women receive ''psychological
scars'' and #3000 from Thomson Holidays after being pestered by waiters
in a Tunisian hotel . . . a failed vasectomy brings a couple and their
doctors to court for the bewildering reason that although they
''wouldn't be without'' their new child ''it shouldn't have happened''.
Britain is afflicted with a plague of personal-injury litigation which
returns us to infancy. For the toddler there is no such thing as bad
luck, no such thing as misadventure and, of course, no such thing as
personal responsibility. When infants hurt themselves they scream, blame
the world, and demand comfort.
We spell things out for three-year-olds; we exhaust ourselves with the
essential repetition of our cautions. In America, whence much of the
compensation culture comes, they spell things out for adults. The brain
hurts with the android voices of the Magic Kingdom's Disney rides:
''Take care when alighting and hold young children tightly by the
hand.'' Even the Wild West has been tamed by the fear of litigation;
wannabe cowboys at dude ranches are not permitted to do anything as
reckless as trotting their horses.
Every trade has its cowboys, including medicine, and it goes without
saying that negligent workmanship should carry penalties. But at the
dafter end of the spectrum of claims for damages (footballers suing
their clubs for giving them arthritic knees, heavy drinkers suing
alcohol producers for causing liver disease) is a climate of complaint
which is exacerbating the increasingly fractious relationship between
doctors and their patients.
This week Health Minister Stephen Dorrell made threatening noises at
incompetent doctors, but said nothing at all about incompetent patients:
patients who don't listen properly, who wilfully ignore their doctor's
advice, who think they know better than the instructions on the label of
a bottle of pills, who waste incalculable amounts of health service time
by using their GP's surgery as a social club.
Every trade has its cowboys, including law, and the growth industry in
compensation claims has been partly driven by a breed of specialist
solicitors whose contribution to our bleatin'-greetin' culture makes the
reputation of lawyers ever more louche. Twenty such firms who (as their
euphemism goes) ''pro-actively'' seek clients with suits to press have
just registered with an enterprising marketing company with names to
sell.
''Ambulance chasing'' is the media name for this new trade. A story in
yesterday's Daily Telegraph tells how a Tyneside firm called Legal
Marketing Direct has randomly trawled the public for details of
accidents which may be actionable and come up with 40,000 names and
addresses. At #1 a shot it will sell them to solicitors, who may please
their clients with their efforts on behalf of those who trip over
pavements or slip on pigeon droppings, but who dismay the rest of us.
We are the fall guys who haven't fallen. Directly or indirectly,
through personal premiums, local and national taxes or higher prices,
the great grown-up British public is required to make up the shortfall
in profit of those who insure the purveyors of hot coffee, stackers of
supermarket tins, manufacturers of bouncy castles, contractors of
Tunisian waiters, advisers of medical probabilities and custodians of
uneven pavements. We will see hell freeze before the insurance companies
lose out.
But the opportunism of ambulance chasers and the avarice of lawyers
would wither and die on ground which hadn't been fertilised with the
idea that everything and everybody owes us one; that someone must be
found and held responsible for every sling and arrow that fortune,
outrageous or otherwise, tosses our way.
The rot set in when the Americans included ''the pursuit of
happiness'' in their Bill of Rights and continued with the United
Nations Declaration of Human Rights, which has convinced every woman in
the advanced world that she has ''the right to bear children'' by
whatever expensive and bizarre treatment medical science can devise.
The use of the word ''rights'' has been abused even more than the use
of the word ''victim''. It's one of the oddities of Britain today that a
Government which preaches a doctrine of personal responsibility also
woos the electorate with its largely inoperable citizens' charters,
reinforcing the notion that out there, by God, is a conspiracy of forces
denying us our rights.
Real rights are denied in the Balkans and other painful places of the
world. Phoney rights are denied when trains don't run on time or
hospital consultants get behind schedule. Efficiency is uncomfortably
commanded by moral language.
When the war heroine Odette Churchill died a few months ago I was
struck by an obituary which said that on the rare occasions she talked
about her imprisonment and torture by the Gestapo she ''minimised'' the
after-effects. Today, of course, she would be offered crisis counselling
and a package of compensation. Stoicism, I thought; that's what we're
losing. The gene of stoicism will soon disappear from the DNA of the
privileged nations.

IT'S time for culture vultures to meet the mouse. If you want to stay
ahead of the pack, or the flock, or whatever the heck the collective
noun for vultures is, then you'd better start clicking; the Internet has
arrived on the Fringe, bringing a new-found sense of sophistication and
organisation to the alternative Festival's anarchy. Now, via access to
the World Wide Web at http://www.presence.cp.uk/fringe the Fringe
programme, an essentially problematic guide which becomes out-of-date as
soon as it is printed, can be updated daily, with the public, at least
the technology-using public, informed of changes and cancellations as
they happen, well in advance of festivities commencing.
''Essentially the fringe on the Web is the only comprehensive source
of information,'' says the Fringe's marketing manager, Stuart Buchanan,
the man behind the innovation. ''We're really pleased with the programme
which is incredibly user-friendly.'' He speaketh the truth; even a
techno-moron like myself was able to ''surf'' through reams of
information on times of shows and company details.
While the programme was created by the Fringe, devised by whizz kid
Evan Welsh, the information is sorted by Web 13, an Edinburgh Internet
Cafe who are committed to putting Scottish culture on to the Web.
Fringe-goers without the technology at home or in the office can surf
the programme at Web 13 at Bread Street, who are ''optimistically
prepared'' for the expected onslaught of visitors.
Another strand of the innovation is a review board, enabling
enthusiastic audiences to post their own crits of shows. ''At first we
thought it could cause problems but then we decided to make it an
unofficial site, free from any censorship or artistic control which is
essentially what the Fringe is about,'' said Buchanan.
It certainly looks set to be the most popular element of the Fringe on
the Web. Three weeks before the Fringe even began it was already filling
up with advance crits of shows caught in London, America, and even Iran.
Devious fringe performers have already been posting their own crits,
although blatant self-promotion is somewhat hindered by the fact that
correspondents are identified by their computer location. None the less,
one Fred Schlomka from the States has posted no less than nine gushing
reviews about the jazz group Urda, failing to reveal the fact that he is
the group's saxophonist. Comic Ian Cognito opts for the ironic approach
''Why can't I review myself? Trouble is I think I am shit.''
So, now you have the technology; when the Festival begins, don't just
sit there moaning about how the critics have got it wrong. Zoom down to
Web 13 and get your own point across.

A FAMILY outing turned to tragedy as three children watched in horror
while their mother drowned after saving her young son.
Mrs Andrea South, 36, was with her children on an afternoon picnic on
the banks of the River Marden at Calne, Wiltshire, on Wednesday when her
youngest son, Jake, fell into turbulent water below a weir.
Mrs South, of Honey Garston, Calne, jumped in to save the
four-year-old. She handed him to passers-by on the bank, but was dragged
away by undercurrents.
Her body was recovered a short time later and an off-duty nurse tried
to revive her on the riverbank. She was later aided by police and
ambulance men but their efforts failed.
As her husband, Dennis, and children were being comforted by
relatives, police officers were still trying to piece together details
of the incident near Curzon Park in the market town.
They warned families with youngsters to take care near the river
where, even at low water levels, there is a whirlpool effect near the
weir.
Inspector Charles Carter, stationed at Chippenham, said Mrs South was
on an outing with her sister-in-law, Jake, his nine-year-old brother,
and six-year-old sister.
He said: ''Somehow the boy got into the water and she went in to
rescue him. She brought the boy out of the water to hold him at arms
length while other people grabbed him, but she disappeared.''
He said: ''Our inquiries are still continuing. We will be interviewing
the nurse and others to try and establish precisely what happened. A
report is being prepared for the Wiltshire coroner, Mr David Martin.''
He added that the river was about 20ft wide at the weir where
differing water levels meant there were strong undercurrents in the
deeper water at its base.
''We are warning that such water is a danger at all times. Even at low
river levels there are still strong currents and the river must be
treated with care,'' he said.

AS THE summer heatwave simmers on and on, a surprising number of
people have casually confided: ''If this goes on, the business to get
into must be domestic air conditioning.''
In Tokyo's Akihabara district -- that garish neon-lit cluster of
Aladdin's caves where all the latest electronic devices from Sony, NEC,
Toshiba and the like are test-marketed before being rolled out to the
wider consuming world -- stores selling domestic air-conditioning units
sit, cheek by jowl, with purveyors of the latest audio-visual goodies.
If Japan's summer heat and humidity were to begin to be matched here
on a regular basis, ScottishPower, Comet, Currys, and our other
retailers of white goods would soon be in on the act. Indeed, one
Japanese inward investor is already manufacturing air-conditioning units
here in Scotland for the European market-place.
But before every perspiring and order-starved double-glazing salesman
and loft insulator in the land rushes off to sign up exclusive franchise
and distribution deals for installing such kit, or opts for a simpler
niche, like supplying the paper face masks which many Japanese wear in
town to ward off the attendant pollution, let's pause, for a moment, to
consider that dangerous little word if.
We do not yet know, with any degree of certainty, whether the world in
general -- and these islands in particular -- will get progressively
warmer in the decades ahead. Popular suspicion that they will is rising
with the mercury. But the scientific evidence, despite a new warning in
this week's edition of Nature from the Hadley Centre for Climate
Prediction, is still hotly disputed.
Getting climatologists and meteorologists to agree on the empirical
evidence for global warming, let alone its consequences, is typically
just as fruitless an exercise as trying to get a clutch of City types to
predict accurately the levels the main Stock Exchange indices will reach
this time next year.
I no more expect the grey cells behind the Michael Fishes and Suzanne
Charltons of this world to sing out in unison and get their weather
predictions consistently right, than I expect the touchline gurus to
know which teams will emerge victorious after every 90 minutes of
frantic football.
The climatic changes we think we detect are, in any case, more complex
than the simple conviction that average daily temperatures are on the up
and up. In balmy, sun-drenched August it is easy to forget just how wet
it was last winter, a memory lapse reinforced by all these pictures of
parched and depleted reservoirs banishing the flood images of six months
before.
But if a noticeably warmer world is the future we all face -- and the
sight of a utility like Yorkshire Water trading in drought orders rather
than H20 tends, in the absence of that expert consensus, to reinforce
our mounting fears -- then demand for better ways of controlling the
ambient temperature and humidity of our homes will be only one of a long
list of consequences which will challenge us, personally and
commercially, in the years ahead.
Think of the potential consequences for farming, forestry, and
tourism, let alone the more personal impact on the way we dress and
organise our daily lives, as the economic ripples from progressive
climate change spread.
Farmers are already anticipating poorer yields this harvest because of
the worst drought conditions since 1976. They expect to more than offset
that by higher prices triggered by the shortages. But if we get a few
successive hot summers they will have to begin to rethink the types of
crops they grow.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that overseas tourism to Scotland this
summer is buoyant. Some in the trade have been telling me that visitors
from England are also well up on recent years. These visitors are going
to go home with truly exceptional memories of the weather. Those they
encourage to return next summer may endure a more normal -- don't forget
your coat! -- kind of experience.
But what if persistent climate change is here and the sun shines
through next summer too? And the one after that? A few years of
sun-drenched Highland and island holidays and the number of tourists
coming to Scotland might begin, by their growing numbers, to alter the
very experience they have come to capture. How would our tourist
industry address that challenge?
All these challenges and decisions hinge on that little word if. The
uncertainties are similar to those which attend any industry whose focus
is the future. A new book by an American astronomer published this week
attacks the Internet, the information superhighway, accusing it of
working against literacy and creativity and providing office workers
with a great means of wasting time, cruising mindlessly at their
employers' expense.
The launch of Silicon Snake Oil by Clifford Stoll coincides with the
launch on the Nasdaq exchange in New York of shares in Netscape
Communications, a group providing software for Internet users. Netscape
is 16 months old. In the latest quarter it lost $1,600,000. Shares were
offered at $28 apiece. By the end of the first day's trading the shares
stood at $75, valuing the company at 44 times book value.
Only 5,000,000 shares were offered. Initial demand was 20 times that.
Trading in what one broker described as ''as hot a deal as I've seen'',
totalled 9,000,000 on the day, implying that some shares changed hands
more than once in the session.
No-one knows where the shares of Netscape will end up. In the
stratosphere? Or on the floor? Who knows what the Internet -- what Stoll
accuses of already becoming an impersonal New York City of the mind --
will have evolved into in 10 or 20 years' time?
It's the not knowing that makes the business of picking potential
winners exciting. Maybe we should all be boning up on how to install
air-conditioning units. There again, maybe the real winners are opening
factories to make oilskins.

SCOTLAND'S most senior army officer was a happy man yesterday. He
formally opened the refurbished Redford Infantry Barracks in Edinburgh
and celebrated his birthday.
Appropriately, Major General Jonathan Hall, OBE, General Officer
Commanding the Army in Scotland, was presented with a ''Happy Birthday''
balloon before a tour of the barracks began.
Refurbishment has cost #23m and taken two years to complete. The first
regiment to move in will be the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.
For now the barracks are hosting soldiers taking part in the Edinburgh
Military Tattoo.
Twelve soldiers from the regular army in Scotland will end a marathon
fund-raising bid tonight when they march on to the floodlit esplanade
during the celebrations.
The death of a colleague's wife earlier this year impelled the men to
march a 212-mile coast-to-coast route to raise donations for cancer
research.
Staff Sergeant McKellar, of Dundee, who lost his young wife to brain
cancer at Easter, has been heartened by the efforts of his fellow
soldiers.

THERE are no top hats. No white ties, no tails. And definitely no
shiny, patent shoes. But there is some of the zingiest, most inventive
tap dancing you are ever likely to see. And it's not from America, that
home of famous hoofers. Tap Dogs wings it fresh on to the Edinburgh
Fringe from Australia.
On a set that resembles a construction site -- planks, girders,
ladders and ropes -- six blokes in workclothes and Blundstone boots
stamp their own character on established steps while kicking in a few
cracking moves of their own.
The result is hot, sweaty, seriously sexy dance that would have had
Ginger Rogers shedding more than just feathers from her frock.
In a way, what Dein Perry -- the driving force behind the dance -- has
done is take tap back to its roots on the streets while booting it into
the 90s. Together with designer/director Nigel Triffit, Perry has
devised a show that celebrates the sheer muscle and the raw energy of
tap.
Perry's earlier award-winning show, Hot Shoe Shuffle, brilliantly
evoked the heyday of tap as we know it from all those reruns of
Hollywood musicals. With Tap Dogs, he has stripped away the conventions
and freed up the technique so that modern audiences can recognise it for
what it is: state-of-the-art primal stomp.
That said, Dein Perry's own career would translate nicely into a 40s
biopic complete with dance sequences. His first shuffle-hops were taken
at the age of four, under the demanding eye of the late Les Griffiths.
But hey! What kind of prospects were there for a tap-dancing teenager in
his home town of Newcastle, New South Wales?
Plenty, if you did what Perry did -- train instead as a fitter and
turner. But the urge to tap didn't go away. Somehow he had to make it
happen. So he applied to the Australian Council for a creative
development grant. ''They gave me $23,000, my first -- and my last --
grant,'' says Perry. ''After that things just moved on really fast.''
Quite! Hot Shoe Shuffle proved a wow in Britain as well as Australia.
Tap Dogs looks set to do the same, maybe even better. And all in four
short years.
Put like that it sounds easy. But it wasn't all a walkover. Perry and
his mates were out to do the kind of things that Hollywood used sleight
of camera to achieve. ''Fred Astaire could go up around the walls with
photo tricks,'' laughs Perry. ''He could dub all those moves on
afterwards, use jingle taps to get in the little half-beats. We didn't
know any of this. When we went to make a video, we put the taps down
first then matched the moves to the sound tape.''
Little wonder then, that Perry and crew can hack it at speed on
everything from sloping scaffolding to narrow beams, and even the
ceiling!
* Tap Dogs are at the Palladium, Broughton Place, from tomorrow until
September 2.

A LIFER jailed for murder during the Glasgow ice cream war 11 years
ago, was yesterday convicted of scalding a prison officer with boiling
water and sentenced to three months' to run concurrently.
Joseph Steele, 34, who maintains he was wrongly convicted of murder
and has publicised that during three escapes, was handcuffed and guarded
by four prison officers during his trial at Perth Sheriff Court.
Yesterday, he denied he assaulted and injured Mr Henry Ashton, 39, in
Perth Prison by throwing a cup of boiling water over his neck and back.
Sheriff J G Nolan found him guilty and sentenced him to three months'
imprisonment to run concurrently with his life sentence.
He said he accepted Crown evidence the assault took place after the
victim reproached Steele for talking to another prisoner.

AS EVER, the ''less is more'' philosphy was completely overlooked by
the organisers of the Edinburgh Jazz Festival's ''gala concert'', as at
least four completely different ensembles took the stage in the first
hour on Wednesday night. Had it not been for the promise of a reunion of
five of the original members of seventies supergroup Soprano Summit,
there may well have been a great deal more one-way traffic going out of
the splendid, jazz-friendly Festival Theatre at the interval.
Summit Reunion's all-too-short set (only three numbers featured the
whole group) was utterly exquisite, and rapturously received -- a real

EXCLUSIVE
A GAME merchant with an annual turnover of almost #2m may stop dealing
in salmon partly because the local market has been swamped with poached
fish.
Ardgay Game Ltd, of Bonar Bridge, Sutherland, is widely regarded as
the sole supplier of wild salmon legally caught in the area.
However, it is now questioning why so many hotels and other outlets
can have freezers ''full of fish'' when no business is done with the
firm, which employs 29 people.
Managing director Leslie Waugh said that even with wild salmon selling
for as low as #1.65 a pound after handling and processing, the
#1-a-pound offer by poachers remained attractive to ''an astonishing
number'' of unscrupulous buyers of illegally-taken fish -- including
hotels.
The local fishery board is so concerned with the problem of poached
sales that it regularly distributes leaflets to hoteliers and others,
pointing out that possession of illegally-taken salmon can lead to fines
of #2000 and imprisonment for three months.
Mr Waugh also spoke of a venison price war, which he alleged would
only encourage more poachers to go out and shoot deer because tax-free
returns were so high.
His comments coincided with yesterday's Herald report that another
mass poisoning of salmon in the Bonar Bridge area cannot be ruled out
because of a bitter, escalating battle between poachers, gamekeepers and
landowners.
More than 1000 fish were killed recently in the River Carron when
Cymag was released into Glencarvie Falls pool as a warning to lairds to
allow local poachers to go about their business.
Mr Waugh, who condemned the slaying as an immature and disgusting act,
added that changes in netting practices at Bonar Bridge had also led him
to ''thinking of giving up dealing with wild salmon''.
Netting is now down to about four weeks in the year, with only grilse
rather than larger salmon allowed to be taken in the estuary leading to
four superb angling rivers.
Ardgay Game, meanwhile, has invested thousands of pounds in a
production line to supply EU-approved venison packs to retailers -- and
wants to double staff to meet demand for the product.
However, Mr Waugh said it could not do so because supplies of venison
had shrunk as carcasses instead went to dealers prepared to pay what
Ardgay Game regarded as over-inflated prices.
The firm, which has already lost a major contract in Belgium because
of a shortage of supplies, suspects that some game merchants are trying
to corner the market in venison by increasing prices for carcasses.
Mr Waugh added: ''We have the sales, the skills, the workforce -- and
the investment is there. But we have not got the confidence that
supplies will be there for us.''
He warned that high carcass prices, up about #30 on the norm, may in
the long term damage sporting estates.
He argued that more poachers would take to the hills because stags
were now worth #200 on the black market. Too many kills would lead to a
shortage of deer for hunting and ''a slump in asset values of estates''.
The Scottish Campaign for Public Angling, which asserts the ''historic
and traditional right'' of all Scots to fish the nation's rivers, said
yesterday it could not condone the Carron poisoning.
Scapa secretary Mr Derek Keith suggested Sutherlanders should instead
organise mass fish-ins of local rivers where lairds were charging more
than #1000 a week to fish for salmon.
* A campaign led by the Prince of Wales to let salmon catches off the
hook has reversed the decline of stocks on his favourite Highland river,
the Dee.
The success of the campaign means more time is being sought for
anglers on the river.
Strict conservation measures were introduced on the Dee after a
dramatic fall in the number of fish over four years. Now stocks have
recovered sufficiently to allow the fishing season to be extended.
The Dee District Salmon Fishery Board has applied to Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth for a two-week extension on beats below
Banchory.

DAVE O'Higgins has appeared in Scotland many times in other people's
groups, but it's those gigs where he holds sway over a local rhythm
section that, arguably, shed most light on his development as a
saxophonist. And it was as a saxophonist in an all-purpose sense,
playing not just tenor but alto and soprano too, that he confirmed his
maturing into a player of great character and resourcefulness.
His headlong tenor flights have always been exciting, but his speed of
thought as early as the opening Days of Wine and Roses promised that,
the sauna conditions notwithstanding, this was going to be one steamin'
night. Joe Henderson's bossa-flavoured Recordame elicited a mellower,
though no less inventive side, O'Higgins's soprano bobbing as he soloed
conversationally.

A BIZARRE but bewitching fusion of heightened theatricality with
laid-back anecdotal rambling, Aboriginal performer Ningali Josi
Lawford's one-woman show is an absorbing autobiographical account.
Addressing the audience directly she plunges us into the cultural
diversity of her life, swiftly sketching out a family tree, bewitching
in its complexity.
She rattles off whimsical stories, replete with barbed asides, picking
through her rich history with the same nimble grace she displays dancing
around the stage, etched with her ancestors' Dreamings.
Most humourous are her mini dramatisations from her childhood self, to
the yakking American schoolgirls she encountered as a student in Alaska,
to a hilarious image of her as a checkout girl, a fruit net headpiece to
discourage flies.

MY father, a McLean of Duart and horribly convinced that he was one of
the Lost Tribe of Israel, and worse -- he was sure we were of the
princely tribes of the Scotti -- was wont to pass his hand across a
glass of the amber when with his friends. The gesture meant: ''To the
King across the Water''. All the Heilan' folk knew what the movement
meant. It meant something very old and very historic and very romantic.
It meant shortbread tins and Bonnie Prince Charlie, who landed on
Eriskay on a lovely beach on that little island on the July 23 in 1745
and the island then had more than 600 people living on it.
Today Eriskay is just as lovely but it is lucky to have 150 living on
the island at all. Probably lucky at that to have the Bonnie Prince
elsewhere. Imagine what it would have been like if he'd stayed. We'd
have had all those shortbread tins with this wrinkly old bastard who
spoke Italian in the first place.
But Eriskay is where Bonnie Prince Charlie did land, right on the
beach where lies the new Eriskay golf course which was cut from the land
by Willie Rusk and Paddy Forbes and with the spiritual guidance of
Father Callum MacLennan, and which I wrote about on Monday.
Ach I am not sure of the spiritual guidance here at all. Father Callum
is a lovely chap who thinks if he takes off his collar, by removing the
wee spot of celluloid from the neckline he can have a wee drink himself,
and he did at the dance on Eriskay on Saturday night and I should know
because I was there myself.
Let me tell you a little about Eriskay. And maybe a touch of Father
Callum. When I covered the very first Eriskay Open Golf tourney I did so
with a certain irony. I wasn't exactly taking the piss but I surely
hardly considered it as a very serious venture. Neither did any of the
golfers. None of the islanders considered it thus. Father Callum didn't
either.
What everybody thought of the golf was what I thought of it: a good
weekend and a wee bit daft. What everybody on the island knew, though,
was what I found out. It is the most touching island in the whole of the
British Isles. There are undeniably more beautiful islands, with trees
and rolling dales, and mansions which would make your heart melt. But
Eriskay makes your eyes water and your heart turn over.
If Bonnie Prince Charlie started his tragedy here, he could not have
looked for a better place. It was bleak and it was exotic at the same
time. There were thistles and orchids, a metaphor for a Scotland I like
to imagine. It was barren and fructuous. The men were small and dark and
hardy and the girls were tall and well-boned with complexions like
glass. The inhabitants were demure and sedate and lively and vivacious
at night at the dancing. Eriskay is that curious dichotomy you can find
in the Outer Hebrides: an island race with large horizons.
The large horizons stem from a talented people, for Western Isles folk
are largely intelligent and bright: it is the new white settlers who are
thick. Well you'd have to be if you thought retiring to this climate
would make you happy. The bright children go off to the colleges and
universities and they never come back: the thick weans stay.
In Eriskay it is so hard a life. Perhaps their Catholicism -- they are
Gaelic-speaking Catholics after all -- has allowed a remarkable stoicism
which the pretentious Presbyterians of Harris and Lewis find a
difficulty in acknowledging. Certainly the Eriskay people have no sense
of the dark guilt, the blackness of the Hebrew, which characterises the
north of South Uist, the oddly mediterranean ambience of Eriskay.
The strange, innocent hospitality of southern peoples, too -- Morag
Campbell baked myself and our photographer, Jeff Mitchell, scones on
Saturday night: her husband Ronnie, just back from the fishing, gave me
a dram. The wee lad Jo-Jo walked us down the road. All the other
children have degrees at smart universities. Morag came originally from
Dennistoun. I spent a night talking to young and old people who spent
years in Glasgow, for Scotland is a village and Glasgow's a street.
But later, after the dance, a lot later, I sat out with the sun going
down, a rose leaf descending across the rust-coloured beaches, the
silver of the cusp of the moon as the young dawn arose. The rim of the
young moon cleft the pale waste of skyline, the rim of a silver hoop
embedded in the sand, and the tide was flowing in fast to the land with
a low whisper of her waves, islanding a few last figures in distant
pools. I said that slowly to the soft and gentle ears of the girl I met
in Eriskay last weekend. She thinks I wrote it. An Eriskay Love Lilt.

AS the hot weather continued to drain reservoirs, Central Region
yesterday took out a #24m ''insurance policy'' against water
purification problems caused by summer conditions.
Construction work commenced on a treatment centre at Carron Valley
near Denny, the largest and most expensive single purification plant in
Scotland.
The #24m facility, which will process 28 million gallons every day, is
expected to be completed in spring 1998. It will draw from five local
reservoirs and serve Falkirk and Grangemouth, one of Scotland's heaviest
demand areas because of its concentration of petro-chemical industries.
The plant will use a system of dissolved air flotation to treat the
water. Air forces impurities to rise to the surface to be removed.
The technique will particularly facilitate removal of seasonal algae,
which increases in hot, dry conditions, and allow an extra eight million
gallons of water from Carron Valley to be supplied daily.
Director of water services, Mr Jim Brown, said: ''The plant offers an
insurance policy at a time of year when demand and algae problems are
highest.''
He said that the increased supply from Carron Valley would reduce the
volume of high cost water pumped from Loch Lomond in times of additional
demand.
He confirmed the cost of the plant would be borne by ''a small
increase'' in the price of the region's water, currently the lowest in
the UK.
Up to #4m of the cost of the construction will be met by the council
this year, and the rest by the East of Scotland Water authority which
will assume control of the region's water supplies next April.
It is one of three new quangoes which will take over the supply of
water in Scotland from April 1996.
Meanwhile, SNP environment spokesperson Roseanna Cunningham warned
that water services in Scotland will suffer once divorced from local
authority control.
She said: ''Regional councils have an excellent record in terms of
efficiency and price. This year they are managing near-drought
conditions much better than the English privatised companies.
''All this will be endangered once the quangoes take over.
Unaccountable quangoes asserting the profit motive will be far less able
or willing to deal with the problem in the public interest.''
* Traffic disruption in Glasgow's city centre continued last night
after a burst water main forced the closure of Nelson Mandela Place.
Police closed the busy approach route to George Square after the leak
was discovered by shopkeepers early yesterday.
Traffic was diverted along West Nile Street and police officers and
traffic wardens were put on points duty at several key junctions.
A spokesman for Strathclyde region's water services department said
the leak in the 14-inch main had been repaired by the afternoon.
However, the mains system would have to be checked and the road
surface restored before the street could be re-opened.
It was hoped that the road would be open again in time for this
morning's rush hour.

THE raw energy which pulsates through this Grassmarket Project
production, continually finding an outlet in aggressive outbursts, is
clearly emanating from the central character, Stephanie Lightfoot
Bennett. Emoting her real life experience of campaigning for justice
since her twin Leon's unexplained death in police custody, her
performance is rough hewn but striking.
Her icy description of identifying Leon's battered body cannot be
ignored; hers is not the voice of the inured campaigner but one still
redolent with anger.
In depicting Leon's death as one which has a brutalising legacy on
Bennett's life, director Jeremy Weller's greatest achievement is in
insinuating that while she can explain, we can never truly understand
her loss. Her pain is her private prison; we've simply glimpsed through
the bars.

HERE is a medium open to all artists, with an infinite range of
possibilities. The quality of draftmanship is outstanding, even from
artists not normally associated with this form. Katherine Cameron, a
Glasgow girl and the sister of D Y Cameron, brings her gentle softness
to The Kingdom of Fife, but it has all the clean architectural lines of
William Wilson's Dunfermline whose buildings crescendo up to the
Cathedral.
There are other artists represented who, like Wilson, are renowned for
their etchings -- William Strang and Muirhead Bone -- but it is the
lesser known which really impress -- George Soper's Log Train, an epic
tale of wild west proportions, and Constance Mary Pott's The Strand
which shows even individual advertising slots on house sides.

IN the 1960s, this was the play the English censor was still calling
one of the most shocking ever written. Thirty years on it is
unquestionably less shocking and the spotlight has shifted.
Wedekind's representations of young teenagers engaging in rape,
masturbation, and homosexuality no longer have the force to shock they
once did. Nor does Tim Supple's RSC production with its teenage cast
really stoke up the emotional fires sufficient to make their agonised
verbal outpourings credible.
Wedekind is, however, still genuinely shocking in his demonstration of
the depths of teenage despair and nihilism, and most of all the debate
between sex information and ignorance.
Overall, one is left with an overwhelming sense of sorrow at the
needless destruction of young souls on the altar of ''propriety''.

ALLAN Stewart, the Tory MP for Eastwood, is not out of the woods yet.
We are not referring to his forthcoming trial to do with events which
may or may not have taken place one Sunday in February amid the trees at
the M77 protest in Pollok.
No, it is an altogether happier arboreal experience for Mr Stewart. He
is to perform the opening ceremony next month of the East Renfrewshire
Community Woodland. The woodland is part of the Elderslie and Houston
Estates who appear to have got the cash from somewhere to open an area
of leafy countryside where Joe and Senga Public can enjoy the footpaths,
picnic areas, and the odd scenic view.
The invitation to the opening, by the way, features the logo of the
Elderslie and Houston Estates. It is a mailed fist clutching a spear. No
pick-axes, though.

Macaulay asks the contestants about their hopes and aspirations.
One young fellow informed Uncle Fred his ambition was to be breast-fed

AMBITION is no bad thing. And if a certain BBC Scotland executive has
a five-year plan which, he hopes, will culminate in his achieving the
post of director-general, who are we to comment? Well we thought we
would since many of his colleagues are already doing so.
Sparra spotting
SOME more detail on Duncan Macrae and the Wee Cock Sparra song. The
new biography of the great man by Priscilla Barlow, Wise Enough to Play
the Fool (John Donald, #14.95), tells us much about the inherent
conflict between Macrae the serious actor and Macrae the vaudevillian.
Paradigmatic of this conflict was that Macrae was one of the founders
of the Citizens' Theatre in Glasgow with such battle honours as the
original revival of Ane Satire of the Thrie Estaitis, highlight of a
post-war revival in Scottish theatre, should be best remembered by many
as the man who sang about a wee boy who killed an innocent sparra with
his bow and an arra.
Ms Barlow in her book says that there are various versions of how
Duncan Macrae came about the words of the sparra tune. The Diary
wondered what was the true genesis of this piece of folk history.
John McKenna of the West End of Glasgow called to tell us that Duncan
Macrae learned the song from Farquhar Roberts, for a long time provost
of Millport, where the actor had a holiday home. Mr Roberts had, in
turn, learnt the lyrics from his father. This seems entirely plausible
since the Wee Cock Sparra is the kind of number you would expect to hear
sung in Millport.
James Halliday offers a very early sighting of Duncan Macrae's Wee
Cock Sparra. Mr Halliday was a student activist at Glasgow University in
1950, campaigning to get SNP candidate John McCormick elected as rector.
The rectorial campaigns were heavy duty in those days, almost akin to
a by-election in Glasgow. To boost McCormick's campaign, Macrae, a
fellow traveller of the Home Rule movement, was brought in to address a
student meeting.
Being an unruly bunch, and conscious of the reputation which Macrae
had newly earned as a star of pantomime in the Glasgow theatres, the
students set up a chant of ''Give Us a Song.'' Macrae replied that he
knew a song that had been written by an inmate in a mental asylum and
proceeded to sing The Wee Cock Sparra.
The Diary has only a vague memory of hearing the great man's rendition
of this song. The words were very interesting but can't help but agree
with the comments on his report card when he was a trainee teacher at
Jordanhill College in 1925. He was adjudged to be excellent in most
subjects but his singing was rated ''fair''.
Ooh, aah, Canova
A MUST for any visitor to Edinburgh during the Festival is to see the
Three Graces, the marble stookie at the National Gallery. For a start it
is free, if you don't include the #7.6m us citizens spent to buy it and
the ongoing white wine and poached salmon scenario for galleries
director Timothy Clifford and chums.
The statue by Antonio Canova is in a class of its own. The Diary was
more than impressed by the smooth marble buttocks of the three Graces
who are not in fact called Grace but Euphrosyne, Aglaia, and Thalia and
are the daughters, as we are sure you already knew, that Euronome had by
Zeus.
They are certainly more effective and better to look at than any
combination of three Rangers players who also cost #7.6m. The three
Graces are good at the back.
We are talking shapely here. But don't just take our word for it. One
of the gentlemen in blazers who mind the front door at the National
Gallery, asked his opinion of the Three Graces, said: ''They're the best
three arses I've seen in here all week.''
Word of the Day
ANORTHOSIS: From the Greek anor, meaning again, and thosis, a
traumatic and embarrassing experience, often in a sporting context.
Anorthosis has taken on various subsidiary meanings including the
realisation that it is not always possible to buy success or the
development of an irrational fear of history repeating itself.

A CHILDREN'S Traffic Club, with free membership for the whole of
Scotland, is to be set up by the Scottish Office as part of its campaign
to increase road safety.
It will be aimed at reducing accidents among children, especially
those aged from three to five, and will be launched in the autumn by
Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Scottish Office Roads Minister.
It is one of a number of measures outlined in the Scottish Office Road
Safety Plan published today.
The plan says a Children's Traffic Club in Scotland could help to
educate not just children, but also parents.
Children are particularly vulnerable, with child pedestrians
accounting for 35.5% of the 1448 fatal or serious injury pedestrian
casualties on Scotland's roads in 1993.
Casualty peaks in this group occur at the ages of seven and 12, the
latter coinciding with starting secondary schools.
While most child pedestrian casualties occur after school, at
weekends, and during holidays, there is, nevertheless, a higher
proportion of child pedestrian casualties, aged five to 15, going to and
from school (29% and 20% respectively), compared with all child
casualties of the same age.
Of older child pedestrian casualties aged 12 to 15, 41% occur during
journeys to and from school.
On drivers, the plan states that the young and new drivers are
particularly at risk. In Scotland in 1993, the accident involvement rate
of 17 to 22-year-old drivers was nearly twice that of 30 to
59-year-olds.

A EUROPEAN business information centre in Glasgow yesterday reported a
record number of inquiries from companies and organisations.
The EuroInfoCentre, opened in 1987 and set up as an independent
limited company in 1991, is jointly funded by Scottish Enterprise and
the European Commission.
Part of a network of more than 220 such centres across Europe, the
range of information it provides includes vital details of #500bn worth
of European contracts.
Publishing its annual report yesterday, EIC managing director Mr Ian
Traill said it had handled nearly 22,000 inquiries last year, more than
1100 up on the previous year.
He added: ''The future of the EIC is looking very positive, with
customer satisfaction levels high. In fact, a mid-year survey of regular
clients showed that 20% had received information leading directly to
export sales and 37% had received information leading to business
co-operation with European partners.
The largest part of the centre's work is the daily on-line searches of
European public procurement lists on behalf of its client companies. The
Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) service handled almost 18,000 searches
last year, an average of 73 per day. The centre's TED client list is the
largest anywhere in the network.
Mr Traill yesterday announced the appointment of two new directors for
EIC Ltd: Mr Bill Brown, a partner with law firm Maclay Murray and Spens,
a specialist in EU and competition law, based in their Brussels office;
and Mr Russell Simpson, head of European development at the Glasgow
Development Agency.

I DON'T know what Martin Taylor's version of Robert Palmer's Johnny
and Mary on the Nicole/Papa commercials has done to car sales, but it
certainly hasn't harmed his concert attendances.
The near-capacity audience loved what they heard. Too true. This was a
model lesson in paying homage to historical music without the outcome
reeking of mothballs. Taylor and his four colleagues displayed the
immediacy of a backroom jam but with the virtuosity that demands a
concert platform.
His guitar-saxophone exchanges with Dave O'Higgins merged telepathy
with impudence and accordionist Jack Emblow, there for much more than
adding a French cafe atmosphere, pulled out some extraordinary touches
in a concert full of the spirit not just of Django but of adventure, fun
and bonhomie, too.

A GIRL aged 17 months was killed when the lid of her toy box fell on
top of her.
Police believe Imogen Smart reached in to pull out some toys from the
large wicker chest as she played in a basement room with her older
sister and another girl.
When the heavy lid crashed down on the back of her neck she was unable
to free herself.
Her sister Madeleine, three, ran upstairs to her mother Deborah Smart
and told her: ''Mummy, Imogen's head is caught and she's gone to
sleep.''
The mother immediately called an ambulance to the family home in
Stockbridge, Hampshire. But paramedics fought in vain to revive the
toddler as she was rushed to hospital.
Mrs Smart and her husband Jerry, a geologist, are said to be
distraught about the incident, which happened on August 3 at their
#250,000 detached Victorian home.
Detective Inspector Graham Haycock, of Andover police, said: ''It's
one of those dreadful tragedies which could happen to anyone who has
children.
''Who would have thought a children's toy basket was dangerous? It was
quite a large box with a very heavy wicker lid which came down on the
back of her neck.
''It trapped her, together with a dress that was quite tight on the
neck. If you are wearing something with a tight collar and lift your
neck and struggle you actually put more pressure on your windpipe.''
An inquest into the death was opened and adjourned at Winchester
yesterday.

VIRGINIA Wade accepted a #5000 cheque yesterday from a Scottish law
firm, after a match with its senior partner.
The cash will go to the West of Scotland Lawn Tennis Association
Trust, to encourage and develop young Scottish tennis talent.
MacRoberts Solicitors, which has its headquarters in Glasgow, will
give #15,000 over the next three years to the trust.
The 1977 Wimbledon ladies' champion accepted the first #5000 donation
after a match with Mr Jim Arnott, senior partner at the firm, at
Gleneagles Hotel, where she is hosting a tennis school.
Mr Arnott said: ''We are delighted to confirm our three-year
sponsorship of lawn tennis in the west of Scotland.''
Ms Wade said: ''Children have such a ball on the tennis court. Now
there are so many good facilities in Scotland to back this up with.''

THIS is rapturous theatre, as blood-stirring as the soil-stirring on
stage. Sue Glover's finely-casted script lyrically evokes the histories
of six women who toiled the land in eighteenth-century Borders. Grounded
in authentic detail it still has expansive scope with poignant political
references.
Stewart Laing's design is heartbreakingly bleak -- a vast, scoured
space dotted with farming tools, the coffin-like trunks the women drag
to the hirings are constantly moved around, shifting the staging as the
seasons change.
Circumscribed by poverty they face harshness with defiant song and
ribald humour, lives lilting to nature's call.
Bonded to the land and bonding with each other throughout each hiring,
they are ultimately self-efficient; their essential loneliness
emphasised by a final stark image by director Ian Brown.

A DENTIST accused of drugging and groping women patients yesterday
told a disciplinary hearing he was having sexual problems with his wife.
Mr Michael Evans, 28, is accused of drugging and indecently assaulting
a pregnant woman just a month after his own wife gave birth.
Admitting his wife was reluctant to have sex after having a baby last
July, he said: ''We had been having problems after the birth. It wasn't
immediately after, because we were pleased about the baby. My wife
didn't like physical contact later that year.''
Mr Evans of Broad Street, Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, denies
indecently assaulting four women, including a pregnant 18-year-old in
the dentist's chair.
One alleged assault, on a married 29-year-old woman, is said to have
taken place two days before Mr Evans's wife had her baby.
A month after Mrs Evans gave birth, an 18-year-old claimed Mr Evans
drugged and assaulted her while she was six months pregnant.
Mr Evans said: ''I was surprised at the similarity of what the woman
said. I was aware that drugs could have an amnesiac affect, and certain
drugs give dreams and fantasies, but I couldn't believe that sort of
thing happened.''
Mr Evans denies serious professional misconduct. He denies four
charges of indecent behaviour, but admits five charges of over-sedating
patients.
The hearing continues.

STAFF at the troubled East Park Home and School for infirm children in
Glasgow claimed yesterday that a promised pay rise would leave them #210
a month worse off.
Industrialist Sir Matthew Goodwin, a senior member of the East Park
board, told The Herald a fortnight ago that all staff were to get a
rise, but angry workers said yesterday the abolition of their special
duty rate would turn it into a loss.
The workers also alleged that after posters and petitions were
circulated by concerned supporters of the home, some board members
visited shops and demanded the petitions be returned.
The staff, who have written anonymously to The Herald, said they had
been gagged by management ''on threat of their jobs''.
Controversy has surrounded the home, which cares for 45 profoundly
handicapped children, since the dismissal of the matron, Mrs Eleanor
McCreadie, following an independent review carried out at the request of
the directors.
Staff fear that proposals drawn up by the Social Work Department will
lead to a reduction in the number of children being cared for, with
others being discharged for care in the community.
At least 50 proposed redundancies would lead to an enormous loss of
experience and would not coincide with a reduction in the number of
children, staff warned.
Consequently, staff would be forced to work full time for less pay and
with more responsibility to cover the redundancies.
Sir Matthew said last night: ''The calculations we have been shown
indicate that everyone will get a rise, a not insubstantial one. Some
will lose out if they have prolonged absences.
''Some people distributed a poster around the shops, appealing for the
home not to be closed, and I have no doubt that board members or
management who have gone into these shops will have advised the
shopkeepers to withdraw them because they were being misled. The home is
not going to close.
''We care for 45 children and intend to do so for years to come. We
wouldn't be employing more than 200 people and embarking on a major
modernisation if it was going to be cut down to a handful of children.''
Sir Matthew said he was not aware of any gagging of staff. The board's
plans were being discussed with their unions.

AN MP has demanded a Government inquiry into a claim that the Child
Support Agency sent a letter to a father of two asking for information
about his dead wife and children.
Last night the Labour MP for Cunninghame North, Mr Brian Wilson, said
he was appalled at a letter sent to Mr Alex Nimmo requesting
authorisation to recover maintenance on his behalf. Mr Nimmo's wife
Juanita and five of the couple's seven young children died in a fire at
their home in Kilbirnie, Ayrshire, four years ago.
Mr Wilson said the CSA had made an inhuman mistake. ''It is an
unforgivable situation. The point I would make is that there must be
ministerial responsibility for the failing of the agency. I'm not
interested in explanations about computer errors or officials making
mistakes. This is by far the worst mistake I've heard of.''

BEFORE the start of this show by the young London company Thirteen
Treasures, I thought it was going to be this year's Killer Joe. Low
life. The disenfranchised. Brutal violence.
The prologue, a Berkoff-inspired poetic barrage, was promising too.
But the body of the play itself is disappointingly flat. It is less
the fault of playwright Paul McNeilly, who shows much promise in flashes
of vibrant language and some curiously original thinking, than the
lacklustre direction (Paul Ryan), which allows all the energy of the
actors to be sucked up by the furniture.
And if you want to know about domestic violence, Brookside has done it
better.

A HIGHLAND teacher, accused by his daughter of sexually abusing her as
a young girl, will remain on ''special leave'' when the school term
begins next week.
The man has not worked in his secondary school post for at least a
year but has been receiving full pay while education chiefs at Highland
Regional Council continue to try to resolve the situation.
It was confirmed yesterday that the General Teaching Council for
Scotland has considered the case but has decided to take no action.
The daughter, now aged 23, has accused her father of sexually abusing
her when she was as young as three or four.
She reported her claims to police three years ago and an investigation
was conducted, but there was insufficient evidence for the case to be
brought to court. However, she was awarded #20,000 early last year by
the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board.
This meant the board accepted that a crime had been committed and that
the girl had suffered as a result. It did not mean the father was
guilty.
The allegations were first made public by the girl and her mother in
August last year in The Herald and in a Scottish Television documentary.
Later, the Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, said there was no
prospect of criminal proceedings being taken against the father unless
further evidence emerged.
The case has also been looked at by the General Teaching Council for
Scotland. Its registrar, Mr Ivor Sutherland, yesterday confirmed that
its investigating committee had recently considered the case. ''The
outcome of the discussion was that no further action be taken,'' he
said.
''The council is bound by the same rules on evidence as the courts,
and there was no robust evidence on which to take matters further
forward.''
Neither the girl nor her mother could be contacted for comment
yesterday.

CONCERN over possible abuse of the right-to-buy scheme was expressed
at a meeting of East Lothian District Council's housing committee at
Haddington yesterday.
The committee took no action on two applications to buy council
houses, which were stated to be perfectly legitimate as the law stood.
Councillors were anxious that the entry of third parties into the
transactions could infringe the spirit of the rules of the scheme.
Members said that young people who wanted to set up homes locally were
being driven away from villages because they could not get council
houses.
The committee was told that one application involved a #26,000 house
in a rural village, where a third of the purchase price was being put up
by the tenant and the remainder arranged through another party in the
name of the tenant.
The other application, also in a rural village, was from an elderly
tenant who lived on benefit. The money was being put up by a relative
who lived in another part of the country and wanted, eventually, to
retire to the East Lothian house.
A Scottish Office spokesman said it took the view that tenants who
wish to buy should be free to arrange funding from whatever source is
appropriate.
Any tenant who felt they had been refused the right to buy could
appeal to the Lands Tribunal, the spokesman said.

AN industrial tribunal heard yesterday that Glasgow Caledonian
University does not employ a single man in its city campus library
support staff.
And it was told that only two out of 36 support staff in the
university's three library locations are men.
Part-time librarian Mr James Digney, of Nithsdale Road, Strathbungo,
Glasgow, claims he was sexually discriminated against by the university
after applying unsuccessfully for nine vacancies, which were all filled
by women.
The tribunal heard yesterday that only 17% of males, as opposed to 34%
of females, who applied for the vacancies were short-listed.
Out of the 52 males and 67 females who applied for the posts, there
were nine females appointed and no males.
Ms Janette Lysaght, head of personnel at the university, told the
tribunal that at the moment the university was ''far more conscious'' of
the gender distribution on the disability and ethnic side than on sexual
discrimination.
She explained the numbers of successful women for library posts by
saying: ''Female candidates were the best candidates on the day.''
Questioned about university paperwork which claimed that no men had
applied for one library vacancy, filled by a woman, for which Mr Digney
completed an application form, received and date-stamped by the
university, she replied: ''I really don't have any answer to it.''
The tribunal was adjourned to a date to be fixed.

THE biggest trade union backer of the Scottish Labour Party yesterday
put its weight behind a Scottish Parliament of 145 members -- large
enough to have a better level of proportional representation and gender
equality.
The backing from the Transport and General Workers Union runs against
the suggestions that Labour might be moving towards a membership of 112
for the Edinburgh Parliament, which has been criticised by Labour women
as not affording proper scope for gender equality, and by Liberal
Democrats, who want to maximise the effect of proportional
representation.
Support for what is in effect the Liberal Democrat position in
negotiations was welcomed from that quarter, but the TGWU's women's
officer, Ms Yvonne Strachan, stressed that the union's consultation
document was based on firm principles.
Senior union official Mr Jimmy Elsby, the Scottish secretary
designate, said the union was committed to ''a truly democratic and
representative parliament'', adding that the Labour Party's suggestion
of 112 members ''will not deliver accountability, proportionality nor
effective representation''.
The Scottish Labour Party stresses that its consultation period on the
subject is still continuing and no decision has yet been reached.

SCOTTISH Hydro-Electric could employ 56 clerical trainees at #5165 or
11 engineers on #26,839 for the #288,047 annual earnings of chief
executive Roger Young, according to a Labour Party report castigating
the chasm between directors' and employees' wages in the privatised
utilities.
Launching the report yesterday in a bid to ensure that ''executive
greed'' remained firmly in the headlines, Shadow Employment spokesman
Ian McCartney said it was time to ''put a stop to the scandal of boom in
the boardroom and bust for the workforce''.
Mr McCartney said it was ''outrageous'' that one director of a
privatised company -- former Tory Trade Secretary Lord Young (whose
salary, as chairman of Cable and Wireless, amounted to #948,000) --
could earn more in a month than 1.3 million people earning less than
#2.50 an hour could expect to be paid in a decade.
Other targets included British Gas, which Labour maintains could
employ 50 extra service fitters (earning #10,180), or 42 service
engineers earning #12,180 for the #511,602 a year it pays its chief
executive, Mr Cedric Brown.
British Telecom could employ 84 operators (#9005), or 100 cleaners
(#7914), with the cash paid in salary, plus pension, of #757,000 that
goes to chairman Sir Iain Vallance, Labour said.
Meanwhile Yorkshire Water could employ eight maintenance managers
(earning #23,319) for the #189,000 it paid in salary and pension to its
highest paid director.
The company, with pre-tax profits last year of #144m, sparked fury
yesterday by applying for a Government drought order amid claims that
its own leaky system spills 100 million gallons of treated water down
the drain every day.
Labour pointed out that British Gas had axed 26,000 jobs since
privatisation and planned to cut a further 20,000. Some 90,000 jobs had
been lost at BT since privatisation and an additional 60,000 job losses
were planned.
Mr McCartney said: ''In the regional water and electricity companies,
the pay of top directors could pay for literally hundreds of extra
frontline staff to serve the public.
''Yet some of the biggest job cuts are taking place in companies
paying the highest salaries. In some cases, utility bosses are earning
more in one week than many of their employees earn in a year.''
Labour would introduce proper accountability to curb boardroom
excesses, he said, and introduce a minimum wage to alleviate poverty
among low-paid workers.
The party's report also said:
* It would take a full-time earner on #2.50 an hour just over five
years to match former Tory Trade Secretary Lord Tebbit's British Telecom
salary of #26,000 per year.
* The highest paid director of East Midlands Electricity earns a
salary plus pension of #250,084 -- the equivalent of 34 trainees (#7256)
or eight senior engineers (#32,907).
* The highest paid director of London Electricity earns a salary and
pension of #273,782 -- the equivalent of 16 metering engineers
(#17,128).
* The highest paid director of South Wales Electricity earns a salary
plus pension of #252,300. For the same money the company could employ 18
foremen (#14,157).

DISABLED workers, their employers, and the taxpayer will lose out if
the Government goes ahead with rumoured plans to scrap a scheme
encouraging companies to give jobs to the disabled, the TUC warned
yesterday.
The scheme, Access to Work, saves the taxpayer more than #8m by
keeping about 9000 people a year off incapacity benefit, said the TUC
report.
It believes the Government is considering ending its 100% funding of
the scheme and shifting half of the cost on to employers, as part of the
review of the first year of its operation.
Disability research officer, Mr Richard Exell, said this could deter
some employers from taking on disabled workers, and financially
discriminate against better employers.
''It would also hand a competitive advantage to bad employers, and
would send out entirely the wrong message to business. It would also be
bad for the taxpayer,'' he said.
The report, which said the scheme cost #15m, estimated it would cost
#23.5m in benefits to support the same number of people currently on the
scheme.
The TUC is surprised the Access to Work scheme is being reviewed at
the same time as the Government is trying to introduce
anti-discrimination leglisation -- the Disability Discrimination Bill --
through Parliament.
TUC general secretary John Monks said disabled people already had
difficulty finding and keeping jobs.
Commenting on the report, Labour disability spokesman Tom Clarke,
said: ''Thousands of disabled people have benefited from the Access to
Work programme.
''It is a very practical and cost-effective way of ensuring that
disabled people can play a full part in the life of the community.''
The TUC's view accorded with that of the Confederation of British
Industry and the Employers' Forum on Disability, and the Government must
pay attention, he added.
''Ministers say they intend to improve the rights of disabled people.
Let them prove their good intentions by strengthening, rather than
weakening, the Access to Work Scheme.''
Mr Clarke said he had drawn the TUC report to the attention of
Education and Employment Secretary Gillian Shephard, and called on her
to reject proposals for an employer's contribution immediately.
Ms Liz Lynne, Liberal Democrat spokesperson on Social Security and
Disability, said: ''This is another blow for disabled people.
''Yet again the Government is being short sighted in its mad dash to
save money.
''Cutting the amount it gives to employers to take on a disabled
person will inevitably lead to more disabled people claiming benefit,
with an added cost to the taxpayer.
''I urge the Government to think again and rule out any further
attacks on disabled people's access to employment.''

A FORMER Scots Guard who was responsible for the silver at Windsor
Castle drowned during a swimming race with a fellow royal worker across
the River Thames, an inquest was told yesterday.
Mr Willie Banks, from Fife, sank without trace in just five feet of
water after a summer barbecue with friends.
The inquest in Windsor, Berkshire, was told that Mr Banks, 49, was
almost three times over the drink drive limit when he drowned.
Witnesses said that he called ''help, help, help'' as he disappeared
beneath the water just 15ft from the bank.
Mr Stuart Baxter, a friend, explained that Mr Banks and other workers
at the castle had joined him at his summer home in The Avenue,
Wraysbury, near Windsor.
He told the inquest that Mr Banks and Mr John Preston decided to have
a swimming race across the river.
He said: ''We cooked a barbecue and we all had something to eat and
drink. We sat around, had a drink, did some fishing, and had a ride in
the rowing boat.
''Willie and John Preston went for a swim across the river. I said we
should go and keep an eye on them.
''They swam 200ft to the other bank. They were coming back when Willie
was about 12 to 14ft from the bank he cried ''help, help, help''.
''I thought he was playing about. I told him to stand up because I
thought he would be able to in the position. Then he disappeared under
the water.
''Mark Lockwood jumped in but could not find him through the murkiness
of the water. I called in the emergency services.''
Mr Preston, a colleague at the castle, said: ''When I turned around in
the water I saw Willie swimming back. Others were shouting he had
cheated becuase he did not touch the other bank.
''I heard Willie shout help at least three times. I said, 'come on
Willie stop mucking about.'
''He started to sink under the water about 15ft from the bank. I was
about 20ft away. I dived under the water but I could not see anything.''
A post mortem examination revealed that Mr Banks, who lived in a
basement flat at the castle's Winchester Tower, had died from drowning.
His body was discovered by police the following day, 200ft downstream.
An analysis of his blood showed that he was nearly three times over
the legal drink drive limit.
East Berkshire coroner, Mr Robert Wilson, recording a verdict of
misadventure, said: ''I've been a coroner for a long time. Every year I
have at least one person who dies in circumstances like this.
''The River Thames is a lovely river but a dangerous enemy. It's like
ink out there, you cannot see a thing. Nine times out of 10 I hear
someone say the person was swimming across and then went down for no
apparent reason.''

Judge agrees that arrestment of assets by suspended solicitor is
'oppressive'
A JUDGE yesterday unfroze #1.5m of Law Society cash which had been
arrested by a suspended solicitor.
Lord Coulsfield was told that the freezing of the cash was causing
significant problems for the society and that the real motive was to
cause it embarrassment.
Mr Prem Shishodia is suing the Law Society of Scotland, the
solicitors' governing body, for #1.5m after it withdrew his practising
certificate last April. He alleges that the society has ruined his life
and career.
The withdrawal of his practising certificate followed the imposition
of a #4000 fine on Mr Shishodia by the Scottish Solicitors' Discipline
Tribunal for breaches of accounts rules.
When someone raises a legal action by way of a summons he can freeze
the other side's assets as security for damages and expenses. Mr
Shishodia used that procedure on Wednesday to arrest #1.5m held by the
Law Society's bankers, the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Yesterday the society asked Lord Coulsfield at the Court of Session to
lift the arrestment.
Mr Stephen Woolman, counsel for the Law Society, said the arrestment
was the first notice the society had received about Mr Shishodia's #1.5m
action as his summons had never been served.
He told Lord Coulsfield: ''The arrestment is causing material
difficulties to the operation of the Law Society. They are concerned
their bankers will not be able to meet various cheque obligations which
the society have.
''It may be necessary for the society to obtain a bond by way of
security, which they are informed will cost approximately #15,000 and
will be irrecoverable.''
He explained to the court that Mr Shishodia had petitioned the Court
of Session to challenge his suspension by the Law Society and appeared
to be blaming the society for the fact that there had not yet been a
court hearing.
Mr Woolman pointed out, however, that Mr Shishodia had signficantly
amended his petition at one stage, which had led to a delay. He had also
changed his solicitors.
His new solicitors had sought the advice of senior counsel before
going ahead with the case, and had been advised within the last two
weeks not to proceed with the petition.
Mr Woolman also argued that, since it was four months since Mr
Shishodia had raised a separate action for #1.5m damages, it was now
inappropriate for him to serve an arrestment.
He described the damages claim as ''extravagant'' and expressed
serious doubts about whether it would ever be allowed to proceed to a
hearing.
Mr Woolman said there was no suggestion that the Law Society would be
unable to meet any award against it and submitted that arresting #1.5m
of its assets amounted to oppression.
''In my submission the only reasonable inference is that the real
reason on the part of Mr Shishodia in lodging this arrestment is to
embarrass the Law Society and to pressurise them in respect of the
failing, as he sees it, of the petition process, and not in any sense to
obtain security for any sum sought by him.''
Lord Coulsfield said Mr Woolman had said enough to justify the
conclusion that the arrestment for #1.5m was oppressive, and he recalled
it.
Mr Shishodia was not in court, but the judge said he was satisfied
that the Law Society had taken all reasonable steps to notify him of the
hearing.
Mr Woolman read the contents of a story in yesterday's Herald in which
Mr Shishodia was quoted as saying he expected the Law Society to return
to court within a day or two to try to have the arrestment recalled.

A MAN was being questioned yesterday about the murder of schoolboy
Darren Fawns.
As hundreds of mourners attended Darren's funeral in Antrim, the RUC
confirmed an arrest. A spokesman said: ''A man is assisting with
inquiries.''
Darren, 13, was found beaten to death in bushes at Massereene Golf
Course, close to the shores of Belfast Lough, and about a mile from his
home.
He had been missing for three days before his partly clothed body was
discovered a week ago by two Belgian tourists staying at a nearby camp
and caravan park.
Schoolfriends were among the hundreds of mourners at his funeral
yesterday, who heard the killing described as every parent's nightmare
by local Presbyterian minister Jim Sleith.

A MAN who took part in a vicious street attack offered #2000
compensation for his victim yesterday.
However, Sheriff Andrew Murphy ordered William Paterson to pay #4000
and sentenced him to 240 hours community service.
Falkirk Sheriff Court had heard the attack by Paterson, 25, of Haugh
Street, Bainsford, Falkirk, had ''horrendous consequences'' for his
victim.
Procurator fiscal, Mr George Scott, said the accused was one of three
men who kicked and punched 40-year-old James Adam.
He said Mr Adam fell and hit his head on the pavement, but his
attackers continued to kick him as he lay on the ground.
Mr Adam, of Lomond Drive, Langlees, Falkirk, had been walking home
from a nightclub when the attack happened.
He was rushed to hospital, but it was five weeks before he was able to
understand what people were saying to him.
Mr Scott said: ''He then displayed violent tendencies, which is not
his nature at all. He is now being treated for psychological and
behavioural problems at Bellsdyke Hospital.''
He added: ''The severity of this kicking and punching damaged the
electrical activity of his brain. Mr Adam cannot remember anything of
that night at all.''
The fiscal said that two other men were in the process of being
prosecuted in connection with the incident.
Defence lawyer, Mr Paddy Imray, said Paterson had drunk between 15 and
20 pints of lager on the night of the attack in November last year.
He said name-calling by two groups of men led to Mr Adam throwing a
punch at Paterson, who admitted kicking and punching Mr Adam three or
four times.
Mr Imray stressed that it was an unpremeditated assault by Paterson,
who is a first offender.
He added that Paterson, married with a four-year-old daughter, had
saved the #2000 to help compensate his victim.
Sheriff Murphy told Paterson: ''This is a tragic incident. If you had
had any kind of previous record, I would have had no hesitation in
passing a sentence of 18 months or possibly more.''

<HEADLINE>Bottomley hails digital TV revolution</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>976945291</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TWENTY or more new channels will spring up in the digital TV
revolution which Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley hailed yesterday
as being as ''significant as the move from black and white to colour''.
The BBC and ITV have been guaranteed their places on the digital
airwaves which may transmit their first programmes as early as 1997.
Digital technology provides a method of squeezing more information on
to UHF wavebands, and offers the potential of more channels as well as
high definition, wide screen or even in-car television with CD-quality
sound.
Unlike satellite or cable, it will be received by the same aerial as
normal broadcasts, but viewers will need a new set costing up to #500 or
a ''black box'' decoder to turn the digital signal into pictures and
sounds.
Some new channels are likely to be ''pay-as-you-watch'' and digital
holds the prospect of around-the-clock sport, news or films on
terrestrial stations.
Mrs Bottomley said: ''We stand on the verge of a revolution.
''Digital broadcasting could transform the viewing and listening
habits of the nation, as well as providing thousands of new jobs.''
A Government White Paper disclosed yesterday that six ''multiplex''
frequencies, each capable of taking three or even many more channels,
will be put up for operators' bids.
Each multiplex operator may deal with more than one broadcaster, in
consortia or other arrangement, and both will need to be licensed by the
Independent Television Commission.
Terrestrial channels BBC1, BBC2, ITV and Channel 4 with S4C, as well
as the yet-to-be-established Channel 5, will be reserved enough space to
broadcast their programming simultaneously in analogue and digital, and
they will be obliged to simulcast at least 80% of the time.
The terrestrial channels can also join the race for more airwave space
on the same commercial terms as other companies.
To guard against monopoly control, ownership of licences to broadcast
will be limited to 25% of the available capacity and 15% of the total
audience.
However, multiplex operators, who might be expected to make the
biggest investment in the new technology, will be able to bid for up to
two out of six frequencies, and Mrs Bottomley said she would even
consider a limit of three, or half of all capacity.
''These proposals are designed to create a sensible regulatory regime
which will protect the consumer and provide competition while
encouraging new investment in new digital technology,'' she said.
Broadcast companies broadly welcomed the White Paper, but hinted there
was a long and heated debate ahead.
BBC deputy general Bob Phillis said: ''We are pleased that our public
service channels in radio and television will have a guaranteed place in
the digital future.''
The BBC will launch its digital radio service next month, he said.
Channel 4's director of programmes, John Willis, said the station was
particularly pleased digital frequency allocation meant Welsh viewers
would eventually be able to see the full Channel 4 range of programmes
as well as S4C.
Shadow Heritage Spokesman Mark Fisher welcomed the Government's
statement, but said he had reservations about the reliance on the market
to drive the transition to digital, and the absence of any commitment to
ensuring a universal service.
''Digital technology will play a crucial role in shaping the
information and entertainment in the new millenium, but market forces
alone will not secure a digital revolution,'' Mr Fisher said.

<TEXT>
DETECTIVES are trying to piece together the events which led to a
tragic incident in which a 10-year-old boy shot and killed his
eight-year-old cousin.
Schoolgirl Margaret McEwan had visited the home of her cousin James,
and his parents Jimmy and Louise McEwan, with her parents.
But as the four adults chatted in the front room of the house on Blair
Drive, Bedworth, Warwickshire, on Tuesday, the boy fired an air rifle
and Margaret was hit.
Police called to the scene of what was being described as ''a tragic
accident'' by the girl's parents, found the child with a single pellet
wound in the chest.
The gun, which belongs to a member of the family, was a widely
available BSA Sportsman .22 air rifle which fires lead pellets at speeds
of up to 620ft a second, and is usually used for target practice by gun
club members.
Detective Inspector Graham Moreton, leading the investigation into the
shooting, said that despite the incident appearing to be nothing more
than a family tragedy, he was still keeping an open mind and was waiting
to interview James, who was described as ''suffering from trauma''.
Mr Moreton said that although the rifle had not been held against
Margaret's chest, it had been fired at ''very close range'', and a
post-mortem examination revealed that the pellet, described as looking
like a miniature shuttlecock, had pierced Margaret's flesh and lodged
itself in her heart.
Despite being rushed to the nearby George Elliot hospital in Nuneaton,
Margaret died soon after the shooting.
Questions have been raised over how the loaded 8lb rifle came to be in
the hands of the youngster, who is below the legal age of 17 to use such
a weapon without proper supervision.
Mr Conrad Cross, of the national Gun Trade Association, said: ''This
is almost a freak accident. Air rifles of this sort are not normally
capable of killing someone, and the last recorded incident was 10 or 12
years ago, and involved a baby who was shot in a cot.''
Mr Cross added that he did not believe a 10-year-old boy would have
been capable of loading the heavy and complex rifle himself, and warned
other parents keeping firearms at home to make sure they were
immobilised or stored safely.
Parents Elaine and Thomas McEwan, a retired miner who suffers from a
serious heart condition and has suffered three heart attacks in recent
years, have lived nearby in Ashington Road with Margaret, her sister
Emma, aged five, and brother Thomas, 10, for three years.
It was believed the two families moved to the area with two other
brothers and Margaret's grandmother Mary, who is in her 70s, from
Glasgow.
Police said the parents were receiving medical treatment after
witnessing their daughter's death, and said the family had been ''hit
hard'' by the tragedy.
It was not confirmed if any other children had been present at the
time of the shooting.
Detectives were speaking to all of the adult witnesses to the shooting
before speaking to James.
Mr Moreton said: ''I understand the rifle was usually used for target
practice and was generally stored very responsibly. The implication of
it being an accident is that no one knew it was loaded.
''Obviously air guns are dangerous. People are getting hurt all the
time by these weapons.''

Bangkok, Thursday
THE trial of two Britons charged with trying to smuggle heroin out of
Thailand was adjourned today to allow the lawyer of one of the
defendants more time to call a witness.
A lawyer representing Robert Lock, 30, from Cambridge, told the
Bangkok criminal court he needed more time to subpoena a Bangkok-based
airline official to testify at the trial.
Puttri Kuvanonda told reporters that if the airline official continued
to ignore the subpoena, the court would issue a warrant for his arrest.
The trial of Lock and Sandra Gregory, 29, from Halifax, will resume on
September 18.
The pair were arrested on heroin trafficking charges at Bangkok
airport in February 1993 after they were searched as they were about to
board a flight to Japan and Gregory was found with 102 grams of heroin
in her possession. Gregory has pled guilty while Lock pleaded innocent.
Heroin trafficking carries the death penalty in Thailand though the
sentence is invariably commuted to a lengthy prison term.--Reuter

A DIRECTOR of a Highland health trust was last night sacked over
allegations of harassment involving two members of staff. Meanwhile,
investigations are still under way into a #1.8m cash shortfall.
Mr Alastair Christie was dismissed from his job as finance director of
the Highland Communities NHS Trust after being suspended on full pay for
two-and-a-half months.
A member of staff has been disciplined over the budget shortfall --
which will lead to job cuts -- though chief executive Mr John Hattersley
has refused to say if Mr Christie had been held to blame.
In a brief statement, trust board secretary Mr Chris Meecham said:
''The trust has considered the allegations of harassment, made by two
members of staff, against the trust's finance director Alistair
Christie.
''These allegations have been upheld by the board, and the board has
decided to terminate Mr Christie's contract of employment.''
The trust also stressed that the allegations made against Mr Christie
were not of a sexual nature. Mr Christie was not available for comment
last night.
Ms Eileen Dinning, women's officer of the public service union Unison,
welcomed the sacking. She confirmed that the harassment incidents were
not linked to the financial scandal.
She said: ''I am very glad the trust has taken this complaint of
harassment seriously and taken appropriate action. This has been a
traumatic case to deal with and both of our members have suffered
extreme stress because of the length of time taken to resolve the
matter. They do, however, feel vindicated by the decision.
''Employers need to understand that allowing harassment and bullying
to go unchecked will lead to higher levels of stress, rapid turnover of
staff and demoralisation of the workforce.
''This will lead to lower productivity and, in many cases, damage the
profitability of the organisation.
''If they have harassment policies then they will have to practise
what they preach. That means undertaking comprehensive training
programmes for all staff, particularly managers and supervisors. It is a
short term investment for a long-term gain.''
A #1m financial error was made during the trust's negotiations with
Highland Health Board. Auditors, who investigated after the shortfall
first came to light, then discovered an additional #800,000 deficit.
Managers and union representatives are due to meet today to discuss
the financial crisis.

'Dramatic blow' to Saddam Hussein as sons-in-law defect as Clinton
pledges support
From JACK REDDEN Amman, Thursday
JORDAN said today it had given refuge to two top-level defectors from
Iraq and their wives, both daughters of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein,
after their flight in a convoy of Mercedes across the desert.
President Bill Clinton told King Hussein of Jordan he could count on
US military support if Iraq moved against him in retaliation, he told a
news conference in Washington.
Jordan said two sons-in-law of Saddam, including the mastermind of
Iraq's secret military programmes, had defected. Diplomats called it a
dramatic blow to the Iraqi president.
The two men were named as Lieutenant-General Hussein Kamel Hassan, who
led military industrialisation and the industry and minerals ministry,
and his brother -- Lieutenant-Colonel Saddam Kamel Hassan, who was in
charge of Saddam's guards.
Clinton offered the assurances in a telephone conversation with the
King on Tuesday night as a row loomed between the two formerly close
Arab neighbours.
President Clinton said the defection of a number of high Iraqi
officials and Saddam's daughters and sons-in-law shows how difficult
things are in Iraq, and supports the firm position the United States has
taken against any lifting of sanctions on Iraq until it has complied
fully with the terms of the cease-fire agreement.
''We will stand behind Jordan,'' he said. ''We owe it to the people
who are our partners in seeking peace in the Middle East to stand behind
them.''
He noted that the US has reacted rapidly and effectively earlier this
year when there was an apparent Iraqi threat of a new invasion of
Kuwait, and said that the Pentagon was ready to act equally effectively
if Jordan were threatened.
Both of the defectors are married to daughters of the Iraqi President
and their request to King Hussein for asylum was immediately granted.
Saddam Hussein's son, Uday, left Amman after meeting King Hussein
today hours the announcement of the granting of asylum.
Uday was believed to be trying to persuade the defectors to return to
Iraq or at least limit the damage. ''If true, it's a sign of real
panic,'' said a diplomat.
Hussein Kamel was the man who built Saddam's war machine that invaded
Kuwait five years ago that was defeated in the Gulf War.
''It's an extraordinary, dramatic development,'' another diplomat
said. ''On the level of military industrialisation it will be a major
blow. He had been directing it since 1987, in charge of all procurement,
everything, right up to the last moment.''
The defections raised the prospect of a campaign against the Iraqi
leader. A senior Jordanian said yesterday Hussein Kamel had already been
in contact with Iraqis at home and abroad about creating ''radical
changes'' in his country.
The Islamic Dawa Party in London said it would establish contact with
the defectors but another group, the Free Iraqi Council, dismissed them
as being tainted with blood.
A Jordanian statement said: ''Lieutenant-General Hussein Kamel Hassan,
who had the honour of meeting with his majesty King Hussein after his
arrival, appealed to his majesty to allow him and his companions to stay
in Jordan, appealing to his majesty's care for them.''
King Hussein welcomed them and ordered the authorities to arrange
their safe stay in Jordan, the statement said.
Jordan had a special relationship with Iraq after showing sympathy for
Baghdad during the 1990-91 Gulf crisis. However ties worsened after
Jordan signed a peace deal with Israel last year.
The Iraqi government's only comment was a brief statement on the
official Iraqi News Agency saying the Industry Minister had been
relieved of his duties.
The defections caught Amman's large community of diplomatic ''Iraq
watchers'' off guard, igniting a scramble for information and
speculation about the implications of the split in the secretive ruling
circle.
The location of the defectors was not disclosed but Iraqi government
Mercedes were parked at a Jordanian government guest palace in central
Amman. A Jordanian armoured car stood opposite the entrance to the
well-guarded compound and police prevented any cars stopping.
Diplomats have long maintained that any serious threat to Saddam would
have to come from those near him because intense security and a record
of ruthlessly suppressing unrest make a popular revolt unlikely.
The Iraqi president has been in office since 1979 and effectively ran
the country for years before that from the number two position.
Diplomats said there had been signs of unease in the ruling circle but
they had not expected the defection of the man who had built Iraq's
military machine.
''So many Ministers owe their positions to Hussein Kamel,'' said one
diplomat, predicting ''interesting eruptions'' inside the Iraqi
administration.
''It is a huge empire built up around him. Presumably that will all be
dismantled and taken by those around Uday, who are a far lower
calibre.''
It also raised questions about Iraq's dealings with the United
Nations, which has been dismantling military programmes built by Hussein
Kamel -- a precondition to lifting the crippling ban on oil exports. The
Minister has been widely seen as more co-operative than figures like
Uday.

NEW wounds opened as offers closed at noon yesterday for spectacular
Beaufort Castle and the estate lands of the late war hero Lord Lovat.
His 82-year-old widow was said to be abandoning Balbair House, the
home she shared with him for almost 20 years, on the 19,500-acre estate
near Beauly, Inverness-shire.
When the sale was first announced in June, it was reported Lady Lovat
would spend her final days at Balbair.
However, it is understood she will now move to Groam Property Cottage,
overlooking the castle.
Lady Lovat was said to be seeking alternative accommodation because
her husband had left Balbair to their son Hugh and family in his will,
which has still to be published.
A Lovat Estates spokeswoman confirmed she was looking around for a
cottage, but added: ''It is a private matter.''
0 The three-bedroomed Groam is currently occupied by a tenant, Mr John
Szarkiewicz, 42, an employee of Lovat Fisheries, sold several years ago
to English-based Golden Sea Produce.
Mr Szarkiewicz said: ''I have been asked to move house and been told
Lady Lovat wants to move in. It is a matter between Lovat Fisheries and
Lovat Estates and it is up to them to rehouse me. I have been offered
alternative accommodation, but I don't know what I will do.''
Groam is one of few properties not being sold to pay off massive
debts, including an estimated liability of #990,000 to Lloyd's of
London.
Numerous offers have been received for 23-roomed Beaufort Castle,
valued at #1.3m, and the estate, valued overall at #6m and offered in 39
lots.
The fact that one of the oldest family estates in the Highlands can be
broken up into parcels and sold to the highest bidders has led to calls
for land ownership issues in Scotland to be given a high profile.
Selling agents Knight, Frank and Rutley yesterday confirmed that a
''lot of interest'' has come in from abroad, but declined to elaborate.
A spokesman added that a ''tremendous number'' of offers have been
received, mainly from the home market.
It is understood some offers are for the entire estate, but with
numerous conditions attached.
Decisions are unlikely until next week, pending discussions with the
Lovat family's estate advisers and full scrutiny of offers.

<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT spending watchdogs today attacked massive cost increases
and programme delays in the four-nation #40bn Eurofighter project.
The total cost to the British taxpayer has soared by #2200m to a huge
#14.9bn.
Development costs alone have risen 23% -- #662m -- to #3920m -- and
the project is running more than three years late.
The delays will force the RAF to pay out a further #104m just to keep
ageing Jaguar and Tornado F3 fighters in service until the Eurofighter
is ready from 2002.
The National Audit Office warned that, despite moves by industry and
the four partner nations -- Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain -- to
rectify problems, ''significant'' technical risks remained.
Labour immediately condemned the Ministry of Defence's management of
the project.
''This report is a damning indictment of the lack of adequate
management control within the MoD,'' said Shadow Defence Secretary David
Clark.
''It seems incapable of handling Britain's most important defence
orders. This report reveals a catalogue of MoD incompetence.''
The report blamed the project's rigid workshare arrangements for the
majority of the cost hikes and delays.
Contracts have been placed more to meet the desire to divide up work
in such a way that technology is spread between the four partners rather
than to achieve best value for money.
Consequently, work has been awarded to specially formed multinational
consortia with complex managerial and working structures and differing
levels of expertise.
''This has been a key factor behind the cost increases on the
programme and has also impacted on timescales and value for money
overall,'' the report said.
GEC-Marconi Avionics estimated, for example, that it could have made a
solo bid to develop the jet's computerised flight control system which
would have been a third lower than that of the Anglo-German consortium
awarded the contract.
However, more than #150m of the cost increases to the British taxpayer
is due to UK industry's success in winning more contracts than
originally expected.
Britain still plans to buy 250 Eurofighters, primarily for air-to-air
combat but also with ground-attack and reconnaissance roles.
Investigations by the MoD chief scientist indicated the aircraft would
be the most advanced in the world apart from the American F-22, which
will be much more expensive.
But the report warns: ''Risks do remain, principally to the
achievement of programme timescales, with a number of major hurdles to
be overcome.''
The Ministry of Defence stressed that defence ministers from the four
partner nations had recently signed an agreement that clears the way for
negotiating revised fixed-price main development contracts with
industry.
''This will put the project on a much tauter footing,'' explained a
spokesman. ''The Government remains committed to Eurofighter's
development as the cornerstone of the RAF's future capability.''

Washington, Thursday
US officials ruled today that the nicotine present in tobacco is after
all a drug and President Clinton gave the go-ahead for it to face strict
government controls.
However with the leading American cigarette firms annoucing they are
to sue, the US Food and Drug Administration said it would concentrate on
discouraging new smokers rather than trying to ban tobacco.
Even before Clinton formally announced his decision to let the FDA
control tobacco, the agency made clear it was seeking a softly-softly
approach.
In a statement about its plans it said: ''Rather than banning tobacco
products for the millions of Americans who are currently addicted to
them, this regulation focuses on preventing future generations from
developing an addiction to nicotine-containing tobacco products.''
However that did not satisfy tobacco giant R J Reynolds and the other
four major American cigarette manufacturers, who at once went to court
to try to block FDA plans to curb cigarette sales to people under 18,
including a ban on cigarette vending machines and limits on the exposure
of children to tobacco advertising.
Reynolds' senior vice president Charles Blixt said: ''The FDA's
attempt to exert jurisdiction over cigarettes is an unprecedented and
unlawful effort to extend its regulatory reach far beyond its statutory
mandate and to usurp the legislative authority of Congress.
''Clearly the FDA's intent to regulate cigarettes indicates their true
goal is controlling adult choices and adult behaviours, not youth access
to cigarettes.''
An FDA report insisted nicotine addiction begins in adolescence or
earlier and ''thus is a pediatric disease.'' The goal would be to
prevent people from starting to smoke.
Clinton said yesterday the government can no longer ignore the dangers
cigarette smoking poses to young people.
The move has been bitterly opposed by tobacco-growing states as well
as the cigarette firms.
Tobacco production is an important element of the economies of several
southern and neighbouring states, including North Carolina, Virginia,
Kentucky and Maryland, and would indirectly touch other states like
South Carolina, which produce tobacco-related products.--Reuter

THE row over where the headquarters of the new City of Glasgow Council
should be located appears to have been resolved.
Labour leaders on the executive of the new authority have finally
settled on the City Chambers in George Square, ending speculation that
the seat of power might be located in the current regional council
headquarters at India Street.
However, the decision has still to be ratified by the full Labour
group.
The idea of the City Chambers becoming some sort of museum appears to
have been discarded, although Labour leader Robert Gould is determined
the Italian Renaissance-style building should be more accessible to the
public.
He disclosed that there is to be significant renovation works to
create an information centre for the public and also space where people
could browse through archival material.
Members of the new authority's executive have also agreed the chief
executive's department and the finance department should be located at
the City Chambers.
This means the collector's office for council tax will remain at the
City Chambers where it is currently operated by Strathclyde Region.
Instead of being a council headquarters, Strathclyde House seems
destined to be the headquarters of the new education department, with
the current education offices at Bath Street and Dalian House being
vacated.
Proceeds from any property disposal will be shared on a proportional
basis among the 12 unitary authorities who will succeed Strathclyde
Region and the existing 19 district councils. Glasgow expects to get 27%
of the proceeds.
Mr Gould said he would be looking for a significant decentralisation
of services and a wider utilisation of housing offices.
''They won't just be used for housing purposes. I want them to be
centres for local information, local inquiries, repairs, welfare rights,
and social work inquiries,'' he said.
''They won't be able to operate social work practices, but they will
be able to direct people.''
Councillor Gordon Macdiarmid, depute Labour leader and a strong
opponent of any move away from the City Chambers, said last night: ''I'm
delighted to hear of the commitment to the City Chambers.''

AN American-born financial adviser disclosed yesterday that he was the
''mystery man'' in the life of Agriculture Minister's wife Catherine
Baldry.
The Baldrys, who have two children Edward, 12, and Honor, 10,
announced earlier this week that they were separating after 16 years of
marriage.
Mr Leighton King, who has been helping Mrs Baldry run an interior
design business in her husband's Banbury constituency, said yesterday:
''I have known Tony and Catherine for over eight years. I very much
regret the break-up of their marriage.
''Catherine and I are business partners. As friends it is quite
natural that we have been supportive of each other over the past few
difficult months.
''We have become close and now wish to develop this into a long-term,
loving relationship. We are grateful to all those who have given their
understanding and support and to those who have respected our right to
privacy.''

SIX English tourists were injured, two of them seriously, in a gas
explosion which ripped through their holiday villa in the Algarve in
southern Portugal in the early hours of yesterday morning.
The explosion happened after gas leaked from a stove, filling the
rented villa near the town of Lagos. It ignited when members of the
Sherington and Wilks families returned to the villa and switched on a
poorly wired electric light switch, police said.
Last night the Foreign Office said four of the victims including Paul
Sherington, 15, his parents Roy and Linda Sherington and Lorraine Wilks,
38, had been flown to a hospital in Lisbon after suffering serious
burns. Paul Sherington, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, and Lorraine
Wilks were said to be in a critical condition.

Washington, Thursday
TIMOTHY McVeigh and Terry Nichols were formally indicted today for
making and setting the bomb that destroyed the federal building in
Oklahoma City on April 19, killing 168 people.
A third man, Michael Fortier, was indicted for knowing about the
planned attack without informing the police. He has agreed to plead
guilty.
Fortier, who has been the centre of intense police concern for three
months, was arrested today. The prosecutors said that he had pleaded
guilty to every charge that they could prove.
Mr Fortier faces 23 years in jail for his crimes. There have been
reports that he will serve at least 15 years. In exchange for this
lesser penalty, he will testify against the other two. His wife, Lori,
and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer, have also testified to the grand jury
for the prosecution.
The indictment alleges that McVeigh and Nichols robbed an Arkansas gun
dealer and used the proceeds to pay for the bombing.
They are also alleged to have robbed a quarry to obtain explosives.
The indictment says that McVeigh rented a truck, using a false name.
Nichols bought the nitrogen fertiliser used for the bomb, and stored it
in various places, using false names.
The indictment states that McVeigh and Nichols mixed the deadly
concoction in a state park in Kansas. It alleges that McVeigh drove the
truck filled with explosives to Oklahoma City, and lit the fuse. They
both face the death penalty. The trial will begin in about six months.
The two men face three charges of conspiring to use a weapon of mass
destruction to kill people, and for malicious destruction of federal
property. They also face eight charges of murdering federal officials
who were killed in the blast.

THE threat of further rail strikes was lifted last night, but only
after BR improved its offer to drivers by bringing forward to next year
a proposed two-hour reduction in the working week.
Earlier, Aslef declared that BR's previous ''final'' offer of 3% and a
possible cut from 39 to 37 hours by May 1997, had been rejected by 5101
votes to 4370. Hurried talks between Aslef leaders and BR personnel
director Paul Watkinson came up with the revised offer, which was
subsequently acceped by the Aslef executive.
Aslef general secretary Lew Adams said that BR had moved
''significantly'' towards the union's position and the dispute was now
ended.
Meanwhile, Railtrack said last night it was preparing a statement in
reply to the criticism by Mr Henry McLeish, the Shadow Transport
Minister, who claimed Railtrack was using its position in the proposed
privatised rail system to levy excessive charges on other parts of the
former British Rail.
A spokesman for Railtrack said last night that Mr McLeish had quoted
old estimated costs.

HOPES of a settlement of the Scottish Opera dispute were raised last
night when the chorus agreed to consider a new offer.
It came after two days of talks involving Scottish Opera general
manager Richard Jarman, officials of performers' union Equity, and the
intervention of the conciliation service Acas.
The 34-strong chorus is theatening to strike at tomorrow's dress
rehearsal in Edinburgh. This would put at risk the opening performance
of Dvorak's The Jacobin at the Edinburgh Festival on Monday.
An Equity spokesman declined to give details of the new offer, but
said it would be put to the chorus at a meeting at lunch time. Scottish
Opera declined to comment.

El Salvador, Thursday
ALL 65 people aboard a Guatemalan jet were killed when it crashed into
a volcano during a violent storm in central El Salvador, airline
officials said today.
The Aviateca Flight 901 enroute from Miami, Florida, to San Jose,
Costa Rica, burst into flames late on Wednesday on impact with
Chichontepec volcano, about 38 miles east of San Salvador, witnesses
said.
''There were corpses wherever you looked, and body parts everywhere .
. . on the rocks and in the trees. The plane was totally destroyed,''
said police officer Jose Maria Gamez.
Aviateca said 58 passengers and seven crew were killed in the crash,
the worst air disaster in Salvadorean history.
Five Americans, 16 Mexicans, 11 Guatemalans, and six Norwegians were
among the passengers, and the Boeing 737 crew were all Guatemalans.
''It was flying so low we thought it was something else. It made
contact with the volcano and the flames went 150 yards into the air,''
said witness Roberto Irahueta, a local farmer.
Aviateca president Frederick Melville said inspectors are to search
for the black flight box to learn the exact cause of the crash,
attributed to bad weather.
Melville said the plane was preparing to land for a scheduled stopover
in San Salvador international airport when it was hit by a sudden
rainstorm.--Reuter

A HILLWALKER yesterday joked about his brush with death and the
''miracle'' of his seven-day survival on a Scottish mountain.
But 55-year-old Robert Sparkes from Buchlyvie, near Stirling, was not
giving much away about the secrets of his survival ordeal because his
wife, Margaret, was taking bids to sell his story exclusively to a
newspaper.
The cash will go to the rescue services who saved his life. Mrs
Sparkes said: ''We cannot pay high enough tribute to all the rescue
services to whom he owes his life, and to all the prayer support we had
from across the country.''
Mr Sparkes suffered spinal injuries and arm and leg fractures, after
he fell on Friday 80ft into a steep gully on Stob Dubh, in Glen Etive,
near Ben Nevis.
He landed on a narrow ledge and was fortunate to have been shaded from
the searing heat by the lush undergrowth and jutting rock. Five feet
either way, and he would have plunged another 80ft down a waterfall to
his death.
Ironically, doctors think the spray from the waterfall may have kept
him alive. They also believe the fact he was drifting in and out of
consciousness helped conserve his energy and survive his injuries
despite his lack of sufficient food and water.
His wife Margaret revealed: ''He stayed clear of infection because
flies laid eggs in his cuts and the maggots kept the wounds clean.''
She added: ''A doctor who treated Bob in Belford Hospital said they
were the cleanest cuts he had ever seen.''
As she gave her husband a cuddle as he lay on his hospital bed, unable
to move, the Munro-bagger stole a kiss and told his wife: ''I have
waited almost a week for that.''
The couple happily posed for photographers, and Mr Sparkes quipped:
''Anything to keep the politicians off the front pages for a couple of
days.''
Mr Sparkes, who was plucked off the ledge by a helicopter crew,
revealed he was getting a bit impatient waiting to be rescued.
He said: ''I think I fell on the Friday, and by the Tuesday I said I
wished the rescuers would get a move on. Now I can't think of anything
that would be enough to give the mountain rescue team -- they are my
best friends.''
He added: ''The guy who found me, gave me new life. When he appeared
on the ledge he just came up to me and said 'hello'.''
Mr Sparkes is a devout Christian and he often prayed as the days
passed.
More than 50 rescuers began searching the glen on Monday morning after
his wife had raised the alarm when Mr Sparkes, of Culbowie Crescent,
Buchlyvie, failed to return the previous night.
A rescue helicopter from HMS Gannet was doing a final sweep of the
area on Wednesday afternoon when the crew spotted Mr Sparkes and he was
lifted to safety.
Yesterday he was transferred by air ambulance from Fort William to the
Southern General Hospital in Glasgow for specialist treatment to his
spinal injuries.

SITTING around watching television can make you fat -- even as part of
a calorie-controlled diet.
Scientists have uncovered a paradox that obesity levels in the UK are
rising even though fat consumption is decreasing.
They have concluded in today's British Medical Journal that sloth
plays as great a part as gluttony in seriously thickening the nation's
waistlines.
Dr Andrew Prentice and colleagues at the Medical Research Council's
Nutrition Centre in Cambridge used national survey statistics to
investigate the possible causes.
Doctors know that a high-fat diet increases obesity. A Government
report last month showed that one in six women and one in eight men can
be classified as medically obese, while a third of women and 43% of men
are overweight.
But although Britons get about 40% of their calories from fat -- well
above the recommended figure of 25% -- they are actually eating less fat
than in the past.
It boils down to the fact that Britons do not burn off calories with
vigorous exercise. Only 20% of men and 10% of women have active rather
than sedentary jobs.
More than a third of adults exercise for less than 20 minutes a week
-- considered the absolute minimum necessary for good health -- and they
would rather drive than walk.
''The steep increase in TV viewing, averaging 26 hours a week compared
with 13 hours in the 1960s, is a particular cause for concern,'' the BMJ
said in a statement. ''It encourages both gluttony and sloth -- the
'couch potato' effect.''

COUNCIL officials made a bloomer when they sent workmen armed with
shovels and a bulldozer to landscape a traffic roundabout in
Renfrewshire.
For just four weeks earlier, wildlife conservationists had discovered
a scattering of common spotted orchids which, despite their name, are
decidedly uncommon, growing in the middle of the Linclive roundabout, in
the shadow of the Johnstone by-pass at Linwood.
Mr David Mellor, keeper of natural history at Paisley Museum, revealed
he was astounded to find the orchids so well established at such an
unlikely spot -- the centre of one of Renfrewshire's busiest road
junctions.
He intended to ask the roads department to stop grass cutting at the
site to enable the plants -- discovered during a local Orchid Watch
campaign to locate plants growing in the wild -- to thrive.
But before he could lodge his request, Strathclyde Regional Council
roads officials, unaware of the implications, ordered the site to be
cleared.
Last night, a leading orchid conservation officer based at Kew
Gardens, in London, described the incident as unfortunate, but not a
disaster.
* The Renfrewshire Orchid Watch campaign made one other exciting find,
a Coalroot Orchid, which is only known to have survived at one other UK
location.

Taba, Friday
ISRAEL and the PLO said today they had reached a partial agreement on
the expansion of Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and it had been
initialled by Israeli and PLO officials.
''We can say we have now an agreement but we still have some points
left to sub-committees to continue,'' PLO leader Yasser Arafat said at a
joint news conference with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.
Peres said: ''The document has been initialled by (Israeli Foreign
Ministry Director General) Uri Savir and (PLO chief negotiator) Abu Alaa
in the name of the Palestinian Authority and the Government of Israel.''
The announcement came just before 3am.
Peres and Arafat had been holding marathon talks at the Egyptian Red
Sea resort of Taba since Monday.
Officials said Hebron, the only town with Jewish settlers living in
it, was one of the issues that would have to be fully worked out by
sub-committees.
Yesterday, officials said that once an outline accord was reached it
would take several weeks to draft a full deal.
The general West Bank agreement calls for an Israeli pullout from Arab
population centres before Palestinian elections and further redeployment
from other areas after the poll.--Reuter

riverbed in a Perthshire private estate.
The accident happened about 7.30pm in the grounds around Dallick House

Emergency crews took three hours to free the couple as the helicopter

One of the two died and the other, believed to be seriously injured,

HEATHER Davies, fighting for her life in hospital after the Wrexham
fire, is already the focus of a local appeal.
For two months, townspeople have been raising money to send her to
Russia for a sight-saving operation.
British doctors said they could not perform the delicate task of
removing a cataract behind her left eye which has left her partially
blind.
Mrs Sandra Nicholson and Mrs Gwladys O'Conner started a campaign to
raise #10,000 needed to send Heather and her mother, Mandy, to Russia.
Fund-raising events were held with the help of public houses and
collection boxes placed in shops. The organisers wrote to the Duchess of
York and received a promise of support.
Mrs Nicholson, of Millbank Road, Rhyl, said: ''Words just cannot
explain what we feel at this moment.'' She and Mrs O'Conner were praying
''that all the work for little Heather over the past two months will not
have been in vain''.

FIVE children died and two more were critical in hospital last night
with serious burns after fire swept through a terraced council house.
Neighbours were beaten back by heat and flames and could only listen
to the pathetic cries of the children caught upstairs by the
breakfast-time blaze in Wrexham, North Wales.
Two adults and two children were rescued but four boys and a girl died
at the scene despite frantic efforts by emergency services to revive
them. The oldest victim was 12, the youngest were three-year-old twin
brothers.
Mr Jason Gavin, 24, saw two of the girls at an upstairs window of the
house in Nelson Street, High Town. ''They were terrified and screaming
'It's hot, it's hot!' '' he said.
''I threw two rocks at the window but they were too scared to jump. We
wanted to go into the house but it was like an inferno. The heat was so
intense.
''Then a billow of smoke came out through the window and everything
went quiet. We never saw the girls again and just heard a few muffled
screams.
''I'm totally devastated and will never, ever forget what happened,''
added Mr Gavin.
Miss Mandy Davies, 32, and her partner Mr Dennis Deverey, in his
sixties, had escaped from the house before firemen arrived and were last
night recovering at Wrexham Maelor Hospital where their condition was
said to be ''comfortable''.
Two teams of firefighters in breathing apparatus forced their way into
the house and carried five children from two smoke-filled bedrooms
upstairs. Another crew went in when it emerged that two more children
were still trapped.
Firefighters, police, and ambulance teams worked desperately in a vain
attempt to resuscitate the lifeless bodies of Miss Davies's children
Matthew Foulkes, eight, and Phillip Foulkes, seven, the couple's twin
sons Stephen and Robert Davies, three, and 12-year-old Louise Jones, a
friend who was visiting.
Miss Davies's daughter Sarah Foulkes, 12, and the couple's
18-month-old daughter Heather Davies were the two who were saved. They
were transferred to Liverpool's Alder Hey Children's Hospital with
severe burns. Their condition was said last night to be ''critical''.
Baby Heather had been suffering from a cataract and had been the
subject of a charity appeal to go to Russia for specialist eye
treatment.
Miss Davies's oldest son, Wayne Foulkes, 14, was away from home at the
time but police last night confirmed that he had been traced and told of
the tragedy.
It is understood that Miss Davies and Mr Deverey, who are both amateur
singers, had lived in the street for only a few months and were planning
to marry soon.
Mr Phil Bullock, 65, a friend of both former Royal Welch Fusilier
bandsman Mr Deverey and Miss Davies, said they were to marry in a couple
of weeks and had already bought the rings.
''They were also about to take the children to Butlin's for a
holiday,'' he said.
Clwyd Fire Service officers said it was not clear if the family were
asleep when the fire broke out just before 9am but said all had been in
their nightclothes.
Wrexham police commander, Superintendent Brian Evans, paid tribute to
the rescue attempts last night.
''I would like to compliment the fire service, my officers, and
neighbours who tried so valiantly to save life this morning. That they
did not was sad, but they certainly tried extremely hard.''
Fire investigators and forensics experts were last night investigating
the cause of the blaze.
Preliminary findings are not expected until today, but firemen believe
that a suite in the lounge stuffed with old-type foam may have
contributed to the rapid spread of the flames.
Clwyd Fire Service senior divisional officer Mr Peter Coles, said the
blaze was described by some of his men as ''among the worst they had
been involved with''.

AN electricity boss who is switching jobs next month will leave with
shares worth more than #890,000 after a day's dealing on the Stock
Exchange.
Had London Electricity's chief executive Dr Roger Urwin waited until
he took up his new job to exercise his LE share options, the board of
his old firm would have had to approve the deal.
It was announced on Tuesday that he will leave London Electricity on
September 29 to join the National Grid Company as managing director,
transmission.
In 1994-95, according to London Electricity's annual report, he got a
basic salary of #184,000, plus bonuses of #31,000.
Yesterday he exercised his option to buy 155,000 London Electricity
shares at preferential rates.
To pay for the purchase, he then sold some, and left himself with
110,156 shares worth #890,060.48 at market price. He retains options
over a further 29,350 shares which he cannot exercise until July next
year.
Two of Dr Urwin's fellow London Electricity directors, Mr Ian Beament
and Mr Alan Towers, also exercised share options yesterday.
Mr Towers made a pre-tax profit of more than #600,000, and Mr Beament
netted almost #40,000.
The disclosure fuels the row over perks in the privatised utilities.
MP Alan Milburn (Darlington), chairman of Labour's back-bench Treasury
committee, said: ''There will be a great deal of public anger at this
latest instance of boardroom excess in the privatised utilities.''
Only yesterday morning, Labour published a document highlighting what
the party says are massive inequalities between the remuneration of
directors and their employees in the privatised utilities.
Executive share options have been a key target for Labour's campaign
on pay in the privatised utilities.
Last month, a Government-appointed committee on executive pay headed
by Marks and Spencer boss Sir Richard Greenbury recommended that share
option profits be taxed as income, not as capital gains.
Taxing as capital gains means the first #6000 is tax-free. The rest is
taxed at 40%.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke immediately announced such options would be
taxed as income. But after an outcry from ordinary workers with options,
he relented and ruled that only options awarded after July this year
would be taxed as income.
Mr Milburn said: ''Mr Clarke's failure to take decisive action on
executive share options has let these fat cats off the hook.
''They have been able to cash in on their monopoly position while
ordinary consumers are paying through the nose for higher electricity
bills.
''Electricity privatisation has been a rip-off for consumers but a
bonanza for the industry's bosses.''
Dr Urwin's total package last year, including salary, bonus, pension
and other benefits, is estimated to have been worth some #304,000.
He has been with London Electricity, whose chairman is former British
Rail boss Sir Bob Reid, for six years.
Labour trade spokesman Brian Wilson said trading in share options in
the privatised utilities was ''the biggest and most profitable racket in
Britain today''.
''It is clear that Greenbury is being treated as a joke because the
Government has failed to legislate against naked greed,'' Mr Wilson
said.
A London Electricity spokesman said the share options exercised
yesterday were granted in 1991 and 1992 as a result of deals established
at privatisation.
He said the three men had now cleared all the options they were
entitled to exercise to date. Some could have been exercised up to 18
months ago. The deadline is 10 years from the day they were granted.

<HEADLINE>Local pay bargaining in NHS abandoned, say health unions</HEADLINE>

LOCAL pay bargaining in the NHS dispute has been effectively abandoned
in Scotland, health unions claimed yesterday.
This is a view believed to be shared by many senior hospital chiefs,
who are keen for the dispute to end.
The Royal College of Nursing and public sector union Unison both
reported the vast majority of Scotland's 47 health care trusts had now
tabled offers which matched health workers' demands for a 3% pay rise,
with no conditions.
Unison Scotland senior officer Jim Devine claimed the offers amounted
to the Government ''recognising that 47 years of national pay bargaining
cannot be dismantled in a year''.
He reported his union had received four no-strings offers of 3% ''over
the past few days'' from West Glasgow Hospitals, Yorkhill and the
Southern General in Glasgow, and Dundee Teaching Hospital.
He said: ''We believe that this is a movement on a national basis,
arising directly from pressure from Government departments to force a
co-ordinated national offer.''
Mr Devine claimed the strategy was the result of a meeting between
trust directors and management executives last month.
He said, however, the new offers must still be accepted at local level
and claimed they were designed to ''undermine'' his union's insistence
that national pay bargaining was retained.
The RCN said more than three quarters of the 47 health care trusts had
made unconditional offers of 2.5-3%, including Grampian, North Ayrshire,
Borders and Dumfries, and Galloway Community.
Scottish Secretary June Andrews said she anticipated the movement
would lead to a national 3%, no-strings settlement in the very near
future.
She added: ''When local bargaining began in April there were some wild
offers going around but, as each week and each month goes by, they are
all getting closer to 3%.''
However, Glasgow's Victoria Infirmary yesterday confirmed it had no
plans to revise its 1% offer to nurses.
Personnel director Raymond Cowan said: ''The offer was made on the
grounds of what we could afford. I do not think we will be alone in
Scotland on the issue of affordability.''

A GROUND-BREAKING step in promoting parental involvement in schooling
has been taken by one of Scotland's new unitary authorities.
East Ayrshire Council, based in Kilmarnock, has become the first
single-tier authority in Scotland to decide to give parents not only a
voice but also a vote on its education committee.
The council, which will be responsible for 10 secondary and more than
50 primary schools, has stolen a march on all but one of the existing
regional and island councils, as well as on all the unitary authorities
which will replace them in April.
Although the unitary councils will be keen to increase parental
involvement in the education of their children, none has gone as far as
East Ayrshire proposes.
Few councils have even had an education committee meeting.
Councillor Tom Farrell, chair of education in East Ayrshire, called on
councillors attending the first meeting of the committee yesterday to
endorse the initiative.
''This has not happened elsewhere and if we want to show our full
commitment to working with parents we should go forward on this line,''
he said.
Councillor Dave Sneller, leader of East Ayrshire council's ruling
Labour group, said he hoped education committees throughout Scotland
would take a similar step.
She said: ''The more information you can give parents, the better
informed they will be and the better their understanding will be of the
issues affecting their children's education.''
The council's director of education, Mr John Mulgrew, will write to
East Ayrshire school boards to invite them to submit nominations for the
position to the authority, which will then organise a ballot of parent
school board members.
The convener of the Scottish Parent Teacher Council, Mrs Judith
Gillespie, said: ''I would like to see this initiative expanded. This
shows an underlying attitude, that parents have an important role and
should be listened to. That is the most important thing.''
Councillors also agreed yesterday to the appointment of three church
representatives and one from the teaching profession to the committee.
Labour's policy is to establishing education committees and directors
of education, although Government changes mean that the statutory
requirement on single-tier councils to have both is being removed.
But if a council chooses to have an education committee it must
appoint a Church of Scotland and a Roman Catholic representative, and
one from another faith.

<HEADLINE>Fight for 'soul' of the party. Blair faces challenge from Scots left wing</HEADLINE>

THE New Labour leadership of Mr Tony Blair faces its biggest challenge
north of the Border, where traditionalists gathering tomorrow have made
clear their intention to continue their fight for the soul of the party.
Two left-wing Scots MPs last night added their voice to claims that
New Labour had become autocratic and unprincipled, and confirmed they
would address this weekend's conference to talk about their fears.
The row over the autocratic style of New Labour and the abandonment of
cherished principles will be aired at a meeting of the Campaign for
Socialism.
The alliance, formed to fight the abolition of the common ownership
Clause 4 of the Labour Party constitution, is making clear that it is
continuing the fight for the party's ideological soul.
Last night both MPs -- Falkirk West's Dennis Canavan and Glasgow
Hillhead's George Galloway -- made clear that they shared the concerns
of their Birmingham colleague Richard Burden, who had been savaged by
the party leadership for voicing similar concerns.
Indeed, Mr Canavan repeated Mr Burden's suggestion that the level of
central control exerted by the Labour leader was comparable to former
regimes in Eastern Europe.
Criticising policy changes such as the severing of links between
Labour and trade unions, scrapping positive discrimination to put women
in Parliament, and switching tack on education policy, Mr Canavan said:
''It is very undemocratic to announce changes from on high and expect
the rank and file simply to fall in line.
''That's the kind of decision that the Communist Party used to call
democratic centralism. I wouldn't go so far as to say that Tony Blair is
a communist but I would say that there are centralising tendencies that
I find worrying.''
Mr Galloway added his voice to the fears about the current Labour
leadership. Of the event at Strathclyde House in Glasgow, he said:
''This conference is an indication that socialists have not folded their
tents and left the battlefield after their defeat in the Clause 4
debate. The Campaign for Socialism continues because there is a need to
campaign on these issues.
''We lost the Clause 4 battle but we are very far from losing the war
against the idea there is no other way to run our society than the
rotten and corrupt way of capitalism. There are a number of us still
holding that banner aloft.''
Conference organiser Bill Butler added: ''Tony Blair has to understand
that policy is made by Labour Party conference, not by the issuing of
press releases.''
Mr Galloway said the issues that would lead New Labour into conflict
with the views of the Campaign for Socialism included:
* The setting of a level for the minimum wage at 50% of the adult male
median wage, currently making it #4.15 an hour.
* A commitment to full employment, even at the cost of some modest
increase in inflation as a price worth paying to bring two million
people off the dole.
* Comprehensive education to be defended as an ideal against private
and selective education.
* The reversal of NHS changes and the sweeping away of the internal
market in health care and its associated army of bureaucrats.
''By fighting for these Labour can win back some of the ideological
ground which has been evacuated by us. The road to disaster is paved
with the good intention of not rocking the boat.''
Mr Canavan criticised the tendency for policy to be made up ''on the
hoof'' and backed by what he called a ''small coterie'' of supporters
around the current party leadership.
Tory Party chairman Dr Brian Mawhinney was quick to exploit the Burden
view. He said: ''Thanks to his honesty we have now learned that 'new'
Labour is being run by a kitchen Cabinet, Kremlin style. That sounds
like real Labour down through the ages. No wonder Labour MPs are
beginning to rebel.''
Mr Prescott found himself sidetracked into dealing with the row at a
Labour press conference called to attack the disparity between the pay
of directors of privatised utilities and their employees.
He responded heatedly, accusing Mr Burden of diverting attention away
from Labour's summer offensive against the Tories.
Mr Prescott accused Mr Burden of ''scuttling off'' on holiday -- he
has gone to Wales -- instead of facing the furore caused by his article
in New Statesman and Society.
The suggestion that Labour was being run on east European lines was
''stupid'' -- ''it didn't work for them , why should we follow them?''
Mr Burden, a former Nalgo official, who was elected in 1992, did not
attack Mr Blair directly but focused on an ''inner sanctum of advisers
working closely with the party leader''.
He claimed Labour was drifting towards being a US-style party ''a
ruthlessly effective electoral machine'' and a vehicle for those who
wanted to go into politics rather than a radical party with strongly
defined policies.
Some other left wing MPs supported Mr Burden. Mr Max Madden (Bradford
West) said policy was often formulated without real consultation. ''What
is worrying most Labour MPs is who exactly is advising the leadership
and Tony Blair in particular.''
Mr Jeremy Corbyn (Islington North) said that ''a lot'' of Labour MPs
-- closer to 100 than 50 he added when pressed -- were unhappy at the
ditching of Clause 4 and at the way the leader's office seemed to
control policy.

A SCOTTISH hospital last night admitted that it had reached crisis
point after a 57-year-old woman due for major cancer surgery was sent
home because of a lack of intensive care beds.
A spokesman for Dundee Teaching Hospitals Trust said: ''The number of
emergency patients recently admitted to the intensive care unit at
Ninewells Hospital reached a level where the unit could no longer accept
elective admissions and regrettably this patient's operation could not
take place as planned.''
Elective admissions are where people are given appointments for
operations. The woman, who is believed to have been waiting six weeks
for surgery, was sent home on Monday and told to telephone in a few days
to check if any beds had become available.
She is reported as saying she was ''devastated'' by the cancellation.
Labour health spokesman and Dundee East MP John McAllion immediately
demanded more Government cash for the National Health Service and warned
that the problem could end in tragedy.
''There is a shortage of intensive care beds nationally, not just in
Tayside. The Government must take action before lives are lost,'' said
Mr McAllion.
The trust admitted that the seven-bed intensive care unit had become
''insufficient'' to meet the peaks of emergency clinical need. A
spokesman said delays could harm patients who were turned away because
beds were not available.
He added: ''However, a reasonable balance has always to be struck
between resourcing adequate bed provision and staffing in order to cope
with peak demands, yet avoiding over-provision at time of low demand.''
The trust admits that additional intensice care beds would ease the
burden and claims a ''modest'' expansion is needed at the seven-bed
Ninewells unit to cope with demand. The spokesman said a bid had been
made for additional funds to Tayside Health Board for extra beds.
He added: ''The postponement of this patient's operation until later
this week is regretted, but the operation could not, given the present
arrangements, have safely proceeded without guaranteed provision of
intensive care support.''
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said: ''The Scottish Office is
providing health boards and trusts with record sums as part of a #4100m
budget in the current year. Boards are being asked to take local
decisions to meet local needs and this must include the provision of
resources over the years as a whole, not just where there may be small
seasonal variations.''
* In March, Sheriff John McGowan called for an immediate investigation
into intensive care units at Scottish hospitals, after a fatal accident
inquiry into the death of a 67-year-old Glasgow man, retired miner James
McGowan.
During the inquiry Glasgow Sheriff Court heard how because of staff
shortages there was no intensive care unit bed available at Glasgow
Royal Infirmary and doctors delayed his operation.

<HEADLINE>2700 Bosnians in mass graves, says US</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>1</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976945319</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN American envoy to the United Nations told the Security Council
yesterday there was compelling evidence that between 2000 and 2700
people were executed and buried in mass graves soon after the Bosnian
Serb forces captured the ''safe area'' of Srebrenica last month.
A US official said the evidence presented by Madeleine Albright during
closed-door consultations consisted of an eyewitness account by a
63-year-old Bosnian, a photograph of about 600 people being held in a
soccer field, and pictures of one of the alleged burial sites taken both
before the killings and after the earth had been disturbed by the
apparent digging of a mass grave.
The prisoners were reported to have been held in a football field
about a half a mile from this particular mass grave, which was about 100
yards square.
Refugees being held prisoner at the time were quoted as saying the
Bosnian Serb military commander, General Ratko Mladic, addressed them
every day.
He first promised them safety and then ''a bloody feast'', the US
official said.
Mladic was also alleged to have said on one occasion that 1000 of the
refugees would be killed for every Serb killed in his own home town.
However, it was not known if Mladic was present when prisoners were
reported to have been taken out in batches of 20 to 25 and
machine-gunned, the official said.
The 63-year-old Bosnian man, who was not identified, was said to have
survived by falling as the shooting started and being hidden under
corpses before eventually escaping.
The official said the ''whole package led ambassador Albright to
conclude to the council that this is compelling evidence that the
Bosnian Serb military systematically executed Bosnian civilians''.

A SCOTTISH-owned racehorse that recently landed a 20-1 win at Thirsk
is under investigation by the Jockey Club following allegations that it
won ''flapping'' races at unlicensed tracks in the Borders earlier this
summer under another name, it was revealed yesterday.
Pretty Average, a five-year-old bay mare, won a ladies' race at Thirsk
on Saturday, July 29. It opened in the betting at 33-1, went out to 50-1
and came in to 20-1 before the start suggesting there was money for it.
The Tote paid 89-1.
Shortly afterwards The Jockey Club, the ruling body of racing,
received a claim that the same horse had run and won previously under
the name of Short and Sweet at ''flapping'' tracks in the Borders.
It is a serious offence under Jockey Club regulations to run a horse
at both licensed and unlicensed tracks. Any owner found guilty of such
an offence would be dealt with by the Disciplinary Committee and would
be in danger of being ''warned off''.
The security department of The Jockey Club is ''looking into the
allegations'', it was confirmed yesterday by Mr David Pipe, director of
public affairs. Inquiries are being carried out in Scotland.
Pretty Average, owned by Miss Patricia Hamilton, of Ashgill, Larkhall,
ran three times this season for Lincolnshire trainer Basil Richmond. The
owner took her away last week, telling Mr Richmond she had ''received an
offer I can't refuse''.
In 1992 as a two-year-old Pretty Average was owned by Mr James
McDonald of Larkhall and trained at Dunbar by Tommy Craig, who has since
relinquished his licence. After three races without success she was
taken away by Mr McDonald and did not take part in racing until
reappearing at Mr Richmond's stables at Wellingore this summer.
She stayed for about five weeks, running at Southwell on the fibresand
track, at Thirsk and at Ripon, where she finished third.
Mr Richmond said: ''The suggestion that the mare had been flapping
came as a shock. I believe there is no foundation in the allegations. I
certainly hope so.
''I was delighted to have the horse and delighted it won. I had a #2
win and #3 place bet on the Tote, my normal bet.
''Everything about the horse was in order and it was even examined by
a Jockey Club inspector prior to winning at Thirsk.''
Pretty Average left his yard last Sunday to be sold.
Short and Sweet is highly regarded in flapping circles in the South of
Scotland. She has won four times this year including twice at Selkirk,
and also at Hawick and Langholm. She was listed as being owned by a Mr J
McDonald.
Tommy Craig said: ''Mr McDonald brought her to me to be trained. She
didn't win but she looked as if she could. I've heard nothing of her for
three years.''
Mr McDonald, an enginner with a Larkhall firm, is said to be on
holiday. Miss Hamilton has denied the allegations and claimed to have no
knowledge of Short and Sweet. She was unable to be contacted yesterday.

THE Law Society of Scotland has given its blessing to a scheme that
allows a marketing firm to sell solicitors' lists of accident victims
who may qualify for personal injury claims.
Despite suggestions from some quarters that the move might be a
prelude to the so-called ''ambulance-chasing'' practices made notorious
by some American lawyers, the Law Society yesterday defended the venture
on the grounds that it would ''give the public a point of access to
proper qualified legal advice'' and would therefore be a ''public
benefit''.
The venture is being organised by a marketing company, Legal Marketing
Direct, based in Sunderland, which will sell lists of names and
addresses in batches of 500 at #1 per victim.
Mr Chris Griffiths, 31, who runs LMD, said he would be circulating
details of the scheme across Scotland early next week.
''I would not expect the response to be any different for Scotland
than for England and Wales,'' he said.
He had already received 400 inquiries from English solicitors and
taken #5000 in deposits from 20 firms seeking LMD's services, he said.
Mr Griffiths, who admitted that his own motivation was purely
commercial, said: ''Relative to other sources of work, this is a very
cheap way to generate work from the solicitor's point of view.''
Mr Bruce Ritchie, deputy secretary of the Law Society of Scotland,
said: ''There is nothing wrong in principle with a solicitor paying for
a list of names and addresses to whom he then writes. Nowadays we are
all accustomed to getting unsolicited mail from banks, building
societies, and so on offering different services.''
He said that comparisons with this venture and the worst excesses of
the American legal system were ''over the top''.
However, Mrs Harriet Warden, Director of the Diploma in Legal Practice
at Glasgow University, said she would regard the scheme as ''totally
undesirable'' if it were taken up in Scotland.
''Our existing rules on touting have been relaxed, but it is still
unprofessional conduct to target people specifically,'' she said.
''To my way of thinking this is going a whole lot further than
anywhere we have gone before.''
She suggested that solicitors participating in such a scheme might
come close to breaking solicitors' ethical rules which prevent them from
approaching anyone they know, or ought reasonably to know, who already
has a solicitor.
''Generally speaking, anyone in an owner-occupied house has a
solicitor,'' said Mrs Warden.
''The best firms of solicitors will not have anything to do with this,
so by definition people who responded to this sort of approach would not
be getting a good service necessarily,'' she said.
Professor Alan Paterson, Professor of Law at Strathclyde University,
also said that the Law Society and the Discipline Tribunal would have to
clarify whether existing guidance permitted solicitors to approach
clients in this way.
Mr Robert Brown, a partner in the Glasgow law firm of Ross Harper and
Murphy, said that only one in four or five people with potential
personal injury claims did anything about them.
''A lot of people are not getting compensation which they might be
entitled to . . . but there are definite limits laid down about the way
people can be approached and I would want to know a whole series of
things before I would want to be involved in it,'' he said.
