CLARKSTON want to change their name to Glasgow South. Club officials
and players believe that they now need a broader banner than the one
they have been playing under for 58 years.
Stuart Wallace, the Clarkston president, has suggested in a newsletter
to members that the club and ambitions have outgrown the name.
''Although our roots lie in Overlee and the expanded suburb of
Clarkston, we severed that connection in reality some 25 years ago,'' he
continued. Clarkston moved into their current home at Braidholm,
Giffnock, in January, 1971.

VIRTUAL reality, a concept well-known to sci-fi movie buffs, or even
your average video-games aficionado, is reaching the stage where, in the
not-too-distant future, it will become as familiar to us as PCs and VCRs
are today.
Big business, the military, and scientists from all branches of
research have already recognised the enormous benefits to be gained from
the being able to ''see'' something in ''reality'' without it actually
existing in real life, to be able to decouple ourselves from potential
dangerous situations, and to be able to carry out complex
design-and-build tasks without the consequences of trial and resultant
error.
America's military research institutions have been searching for new
missions for virtual reality since the Soviet threat disappeared and
they are the driving force behind bringing VR out of the war room and
into the private sector via the factory, the production line, and, most
importantly, on to a designer's computerised drawing board at the
conceptual stage of prototype development.
In the States, virtual-reality scenarios are being used to build
submarines, design battle tanks, create virtual factories of the future,
conduct theoretical trials in space and all of this is done without the
designers ever having to leave their design studio which, in this case,
can be a complete room where floor, walls, and ceiling exist in the
mind's eye as a total simulation of the actual environment. In the
automotive sector, whole production lines can be up and running from
concept to completion in a matter of months, where traditional methods
could take anything up to two years.
And here in Scotland, Scottish Nuclear estimates that it will save
more than #4m thanks to a #100,000 investment in a VR simulation package
for its fuel-handling operations at Torness.
Eric Tottman-Trayner, a fuel route design engineer at Scottish
Nuclear, said: ''Virtual reality saves times and money. Without it, the
work would have to be done in the real world or in a mock-up, both of
which are more expensive than rehearsing an operation through VR. By
using VR you have total flexibility in terms of viewing plant and
equipment -- which on occasion would not be physically possible in real
life -- and you have the ability to practise and rehearse maintenance
and repair work in a realistic simulation.''
Simulation by replication, as VR is sometimes known, is a technology
that has come of age and is looking for a new home. As time goes on,
costs will come down and capabilities will go up exponentially. In time,
we will have the technology at home and be able to, for example, take
driving lessons via VR simulation, visit a potential holiday resort to
''see'' just how far the hotel is from the beach and, eventually, estate
agents might become an extinct breed as we ''visit'' our new home from
the comfort of our armchair.

THE build-up is over. Now it's up to the Scottish Claymores to win
over the fans they will lure to Murrayfield for Scotland's first
professional grid-iron contest -- and that means for the players under
new head coach Jim Criner, victory tomorrow over Dusseldorf's Rhein Fire
is imperative.
Despite going undefeated in five pre-season matches, the first of
which was a 13-0 win over Rhein Fire, Criner and his Claymores know the
regular season is a whole new ball game.
He knows too that the Claymores, despite the sacking at the start of
this week of former head coach Lary Kuharich, have been installed as
pre-season favourites.
The squad is talented, led by two young quarterbacks, Matt Blundin and
Lee Williamson, who both have experience, albeit in back-up roles,
playing in the NFL -- Blundin as an understudy to the great Joe Montana
at Kansas City, and Williamson behind another great, Warren Moon, at the
Houston Oilers. Williamson will lead the team out tomorrow.
The key to a successful start for the Claymores may well lie in the
performance of the team's defensive secondary. This group has formed the
most cohesive unit on the squad. They are directed by Detroit Lion
cornerback Jocelyn Borgella, with Ervin Corris, Chauncy Hogan, George
Coghill -- who scored against the London Monarchs in the warm-up matches
-- Corey Dowden and James Williams all capable of coming up with the big
play.
On the day, Rhein will be no pushovers. They are coached by Galen
Hall, who directed the Orlando Thunder to within a touchdown of winning
the World Bowl the last time it was played two years ago.
Claymores coach Jim Criner is under no illusions. ''Make no mistake,
Rhein Fire are a good football team. From the beginning of the training
camp to the end they were the most improved.''

BONN: A technical report into last year's Estonia ferry disaster said
foul weather and design features were factors in the sinking but it did
not accuse builders, designers or crew of any negligence or wrong-doing.
''The commission has found that a number of design features and
conditions contributed to the accident,'' the report said, recommending
safety upgrades for existing ferries and design improvements in future
vessels.

RATHER than world heavyweight champions, the winners of the two crowns
up for grabs in Las Vegas in the early hours of tomorrow morning could
just as well be dubbed title babysitters.
That is because many observers believe the fighters who end up with
the World Boxing Association and World Boxing Council belts will be just
looking after them before they are claimed by the true champion.
That man, of course, is Mike Tyson, fresh from three years in prison
and flush from signing a six-fight, multi-million-dollar deal planned to
again put him top of the heavweight pile.
In the first of the clashes, Tony Tucker will fight Bruce Seldon for
the WBA crown. Then former champion Larry Holmes, 45, will try to take
away Oliver McCall's WBC title.
Holmes first won the heavyweight title from Ken Norton in 1978 and was
champion for seven years. There are few boxers craftier than Holmes, who
appears to have trained hard for the shorter, stockier McCall, 29 -- but
crafty cannot be exchanged for years.
If Holmes, an 8-5 underdog, wins, he will not stay around long after
he sees Tyson coming to get the title, but will probably try to use his
victory to get a fight with George Foreman.
McCall, a former sparring partner of Tyson, won the title by stopping
Lennox Lewis in the second round in September. He has a solid chin and
will try to get inside Holmes' jab and look to end the fight early.
Tucker was the man turned down as an opponent by Foreman, who was
stripped of the WBA title as a result.
The 35-year-old has been through the heavyweight wars, even beating
James 'Buster' Douglas to win a version of the title -- only to lose it
62 days later to Tyson, making Tucker's reign the shortest in
heavyweight history.
The big question is whether Tucker, who has been fighting as a
professional for 15 years and had 206 amateur bouts, has lost his legs
and reflexes. Seldon, 28, is well built, as he is quick to point out,
can change leads quickly, and has good power in both hands. But his
stamina and chin are questionable.
Three other championship are on the card at Caesars Palace. WBC
super-lightweight champion Julio Cesar Chavez will defend against
Giovanni Parisi, International Boxing Federation welterweight title
holder Felix Trinidad will take on Roger Turner (29-2), and WBC
super-welterweight champion Luis Santana will fight Terry Norris in a
rematch of their controversial first fight.

SCOTLAND'S teams take to the ice today in Brandon, Manitoba, at the
start of their campaigns in this year's World championships and, as if
the quest for world medals did not carry enough pressure on its own,
performances also will be taken into account in qualification for the
next Winter Olympics.
Scotland's women's team of skip Kirsti Hay, Katie Loudon, Joanna Pegg,
Edith Louden, and fifth player Claire Milne go in against France today
and later in the week face formidable opposition including four skips
who have won this title six times among them.
The Scottish men's team of skip Gordon Muirhead, Russell Keiller, Bob
Kelly, Peter Loudon, and fifth player Graeme Connell, face former
European champion Andy Kapp of Germany this evening. Perhaps their
biggest obstacle is three-times world champion Eigel Ramsjfell of
Norway.
The Scots will also face teams representing both England and Wales --
the first time that three home countries have been included in the World
finals line-up.

DON'T ask me how I know, but I do, that there will be at least one
rugby league scout taking a close look at the Scottish Claymores at
Murrayfield on Sunday and, frankly, it's no wonder.
I will be there, too, and I have no qualms about going either. It will
be a good day.
It was a joy to watch these blokes train on Wednesday, and to say that
they are different from rugby players is the understatement of the
century. They are a very likeable bunch.
I have the players' list in front of me, and the only one over 6ft 4in
is the quarterback, Matt Blundin, but as for physical development, they
are, as they might say themselves, sure overdeveloped. They keep their
muscle bulk by using some of the weight training equipment that was
shipped in by the NFL in a 40ft container and now occupies a Portakabin
at the team's hotel in Leith.
We must acknowledge that these players are top class pro footballers.
These are no fools in our country.
But looking at them work out it's plain to see that few American
footballers have any stamina. It is explosion, followed by discussion,
followed by planning. A session doesn't flow, and perhaps there is no
need.
Rugby, they say, is a contact sport, American football a collision
sport. You mention to them that they lack stamina. ''Ah,'' says wide
receiver Allen DeGraffenreid, ''that's rugby, this is football.''
He says it as if to suggest that one game is played by girls, the
other is men fighting for survival over two yards. Who the hell needs
stamina? They are, too, and this is a point that rugby players who are
desperate to go professional might want to think about, the last
examples of slave labour in the world -- like many full-time sportsmen
on the brink of success and not earning millions.
Ten weeks they will spend in Edinburgh trying to promote the game in
this country through the World League. Nine thousand pounds they will be
paid. Like all lonely sportsmen there have been fights, they've been
night clubbing, and they had been up Edinburgh Castle four times already
by Wednesday.
As Graeme Gordon, a Scot and the financial man at the Claymores
himself says, they are here on a mission. ''Europe is a growing market,
and we want to expose the sport,'' he says. ''It isn't a question of the
crowd helping us to break even in year one, this season is costing
millions of dollars. I know my budget and we are talking several
million.''
For American football to succeed in this, or any other European
country, then it will have to make inroads into the indigenous sports.
They cannot bluster about it being another game people can play at
another time of the year. We play few enough sports in this little
country of ours, anyway.
The game must attract rugby players away from rugby, and soccer
players away from their game. As DeGraffenreid also said: ''We see
soccer has come into the States in a big way, now it's our turn to try
to get the kids over here interested.''
But could native Scots take to, and play, this strange game? The
attraction -- really big money -- could be there if success was ever
achieved.
''Take one NFL player, Scott Mitchell for example,'' says Graeme
Gordon. ''He played in the world league a few years back. Then he was an
understudy to Dan Marino and Marino's back-up man at Miami when both of
them were injured, and he got $1m to do that. This year, he has been
offered $11m to play for Detroit.''
But, and I got the same answer from all of the players on this one,
the average playing career in the NFL for a top player is 2.5 years.
They all know the score.
As Ricky Andrews, who has been an NFL linebacker, says: ''Thirty
teams, and 40 guys per team, that makes 1200 in total. Six linebackers
per team, so if you ain't in the top 180 linebackers in the US, then you
ain't working.''
Hearing all of the statistics, I do wonder if the World League is
actually a way of keeping some of the guys who have been there, or are
about to be there, busy when otherwise they might give up through lack
of willingness to wait.
I actually believe that with the expansion of both rugby union and
rugby league -- union is the world's fastest growing sport and the World
Cup this year will change things forever -- American football is putting
itself at severe risk by laying some of its best players under the noses
of the SRU, every rugby player in Scotland, and league scouts.
I don't think that we will ever be heavy enough as a nation to play
American football. Most British players are a joke.
But, I think we could nick a few of these guys into rugby. Backs and
back-row forwards the lot of them. We can never learn or afford their
game. They can learn ours. After all, a rugby career lasts a lot more
than 2.5 years.
Still, I'll enjoy Sunday. As, no doubt, will the rugby league talent
scouts.

FORGET the National Lottery, today's Grand National at Aintree is
expected to become the biggest betting day in history with around #160m
at stake.
Topping punters' shortlist will be Master Oats, last year's winner
Miinnehoma, and the housewives' choice Young Hustler, all vying for
favouritism.
Richard Dunwoody, who rides Miinnehoma, proved his fitness with a
welcome win on Banjo yesterday. Pain-killing injections and ice have
eased the discomfort he was feeling from his left knee and he is now
looking forward to the big race.
''It's stood up well,'' he said. ''The problem is the soft tissue
beneath the kneecap which has been badly bruised. I was worried on
Thursday. It was frustrating because I was fine walking but in the
riding position it was giving me a lot of stick.
''Miinnehoma is in great form and looking well. But with fast ground
he will encounter is different to last year and I won't really know how
he will handle it until halfway through the race.''

The Herald gardeners answer your questions
Question: Why is everything I have in the greenhouse afflicted with
grey mould? I remove all rotting leaves and try to maintain strict
hygiene. Grey mould always comes in. What annoys me is that our local
nursery never seems to be as troubled as I am.
Answer: You have probably created trouble for yourself by double
lining your greenhouse. At the same time you have probably been
reluctant to open the vents and let out heat.
Commercial growers have much larger, and more airy, houses than the
amateur. Most commercial men do ventilate on a more regular basis. They
know the perils of a humid atmosphere.
Try more ventilation. Consider removing the bubble polythene. The
worst of winter -- hopefully -- is past.
Q: I can get fairly large quantities of soft wood sawdust. Can I use
it in the garden for mulching or digging into heavy soil? Alternatively,
can I consider composting it?
A: Fresh sawdust may be fine for long-term shrubs and trees. For
shorter-term crops it results in a temporary shortage of nitrogen. It is
better to compost the sawdust, over time, to break it down into a
peat-like material.
This can mean using compost-makers and mixing it with other fresh
garden refuse. That has nitrogen and helps to set off decomposition.

THE pressure is largely on the home sides today as the fringe
promotion teams attempt to reel in the front runners in the second
division.
There will be support elsewhere for Clyde, who face leaders Dumbarton.
Berwick will be more disappointed than Stenhousemuir if their clash in
the Borders ends up all square, but Terry Christie's visitors will not
be playing for a draw.
East Fife's chances of going up are slim after their home defeat last
week, but Steve Archibald will have his players believing all is not yet
lost if they can string together a run of victories, beginning at
Greenock. Allan McGraw will be hoping Morton take more of their scoring
chances during the run-in.
Stirling Albion have to win home games if they are to gain promotion,
but they will find Meadowbank desperate for points as Jim Leishman's
side continue the fight to avoid relegation. The team they hope to
catch, Queen of the South, are away to Brechin, who won at Dumfries in
their last clash.
Third division leaders Forfar lost their unbeaten home record to
Montrose in midweek but will still be a severe test to second placed
East Stirlingshire, who themselves suffered a surprise defeat at
Coatbridge. But the other challengers also have difficult tasks. Ross
County visit Arbroath while Alloa, needing a run of victories, are away
to Caley Thistle. Albion Rovers go to Fife hoping to be the instruments
of Cowdenbeath's tenth successive defeat.

''I RAN as a gorilla last time, this year I am running as a rabbit.
What's the world record for an animal?''
A serious enquiry prior to last weekend's London Marathon. ''I don't
know, sir. We've had a couple of cheetahs, but they were both spotted.''
The Mickey Mice, bedraggled Big Bens, and dehydrated dinosaurs,
commendable fans all, have finally finished. This weekend the classic
endurance event returns to its geographic and spiritual roots in Athens
with the World Marathon Cup -- a race only for fanatics.
Britain has men's and women's teams of five, the latter including two
Scots, Trudi Thomson, of Pitreavie, and Alison Rose, of Edinburgh
Woollen Mill. This international team race, over the original course,
and carrying $400,000 prize money, revives the myth, magic and mystery
of the marathon.
It is 99 years since the event was originally conceived by Baron de
Coubertin and his cronies as they wooed the Greeks to their Olympic
ideal by pandering to the hosts' sense of history. Now the International
Amateur Athletic Federation has given this event to the city,
consolation for failure to host the centenary Olympiad.
Despite the fact that Pheidippides never ran from Marathon to Athens,
nor collapsed and died on arrival, de Coubertin managed to sell his
idea, and so the Olympics were born, with the marathon as the showpiece
event, over a 25-mile course from the battlefield at Marathon to Athens.
The truth is stranger than de Coubertin's fiction. Pheidippides did
exist, according to Herodotus, the only remotely contemporary historian.
But writing some 50 years after the 490BC battle, having conversed with
veterans of the conflict, he documented how Pheidippides ran far further
than the 25 miles from Marathon to Athens.
Instead, he ran from Athens to Sparta -- before the battle -- to
summon reinforcements. That distance is some 136 miles, and was covered
by Pheidippides, a member of the hemerodromoi, a trained group of
message-runners, in less than 48 hours. Herodotus makes no mention of a
return trip to Athens.
Plutarch, writing more than 500 years later, describes a soldier
bringing news of the Marathon victory to Athens with the traditional
words: ''Rejoice, we conquer,'' before dying, probably of wounds.
Significantly, none of the ancient Greek Games had any endurance
event. More intriguingly, historian David Terry has uncovered a similar,
much earlier, incident, dating back to 1080BC in the Holy Land. A member
of the tribe of Benjamin ran from Even-Heazer to Shiloh, roughly 22
miles, following a battle between the Israelites and Philistines.
Tomorrow, with an appropriate detour round the tomb of the Athenian
soldiers, the original 1896 route is extended to the now-accepted
distance of 26 miles 385 yards. The extra was first added at the 1908
London Olympics in order that the race could finish in front of the
royal box.
The record for the Athens course, despite the 1982 European
championships having been staged on it, has stood to Britain's Bill
Adcocks since 1969. His performance was exceptional, 2hr 11min 04sec, at
a time when the world best, by Derek Clayton, was 2-09-36. In those days
there were no big-money races, and Athens was a premier event, with the
leading five runners from the previous Olympic Games invited.
Adcocks, who lost a memorable battle to Scotland's Jim Alder for the
1966 Commonwealth marathon gold, and in Athens for the celebrations this
weekend, recalled: ''Weather conditions were not too bad -- temperature
in the mid sixties with a following wind. The humidity was nothing like
as bad as Kingston, when I raced Alder.''
There, Alder, though leading on reaching the stadium, was mis-directed
and found Adcocks ahead of him on the track, yet summoned up the
strength to sprint past. The old guard, such as plumber Adcocks and
Alder, who would do 10 hours bricklaying, then a 20-mile training run,
reckon today's marathon men are too mollycoddled.
''If they have to run over two matchsticks, today's competitors think
the course is too hilly,'' says Adcocks. ''Well, they're in for a shock
in Greece. The course is flat initially, but then climbs 600 feet from
10 to 20 miles. Then it drops 400 feet in the final six.''

<TEXT>
FORMER European Cup winners Marseille were yesterday put into
receivership by a local court. It was ruled that the club were no longer
able to pay their debts.
''The situation of Olympique Marseille, who have imminent difficulties
such as paying the salaries of their employees, made it necessary to
make a rapid decision at the request of club officials themselves,''
said court president Fernand Arnaud.
Marseille have debts estimated at $56m. The 1993 European champions
were relegated to the second division at the end of last season because
of their financial problems and a match-rigging scandal.
Former president Bernard Tapie faces a sentence of up to six months in
prison in the rigging case.
The court, who named an administrator, was to announce its decision
next week, but Marseille's directors requested it to be brought forward
in order to clarify the situation. According to French law, applicants
wishing to take over the club have six months to declare an interest.
* JOHAN Cruyff, the Dutch coach of Spanish champions Barcelona, said
yesterday he is to stay with the club until June, 1997.
After a lengthy meeting with chairman Josep Lluis Nunez on Thursday
night, the temperamental Cruyff dispelled fears that he might quit at
the end of this season because of the team's relatively poor campaign
and differences within the squad.
''There are no problems. I am going to continue. We are in agreement
and I am going to sign my contract,'' he said.
Barcelona have been knocked out of the European Cup and the Spanish
Cup and lie six points behind arch-rivals and leaders Real Madrid in the
championship. Their hopes of a fifth successive title are all but over.

THE GHK flanker, Fergus Wallace, has been named as the captain of the
Scotland touring party to Zimbabwe this summer and will be joined by
club colleague Alan Watt.
Wallace, who toured with Scotland to Argentina last summer, has
captained both his club and district and has been a key member of the
Scotland A side this season, his try at the Greenyards helping the A
team to their win over the Springboks last November.
At Murrayfield yesterday, manager Arthur Hastie conceded that the
selection was influenced by the need to have a number of World Cup squad
reserve players on standby. Hastie refused to specify how many of the
party were in that category, but clearly the likes of Derek Stark, who
toured Zimbabwe with Scotland in 1988, Rowen Shepherd, Martin Scott, and
Jim Hay will be front-line reservists.
The other aspect of the tour party is the development of younger
players and in this context the selectors have taken along Heriot's
flanker Graham Dall and his under-21 colleague, Paul Jennings, the
Boroughmuir lock. Also getting a chance to gain promotion is Gareth
Flockhart, the Stirling County flanker.
Among the backs there is recognition for Murray Craig, the former
Haddington player who is now based at Waterloo, and continued interest
in Ron Eriksson, Stuart Laing, and John Kerr.
The one position unfilled is the second scrum half berth. If Andy
Nicol is named in the World Cup squad then Derrick Patterson will be the
A N Other, but should Nicol not prove his match fitness then the slot
will be filled by such worthy candidates as Kevin Reid of Hawick, Cammy
Little of GHK, or Jamie Weston of Watsonians. Squad:
Backs -- R Shepherd (Edinburgh Academicals), M Dods (Gala), H Gilmour
(Heriot's FP), J Kerr (Watsonians), D Stark (Boroughmuir), M Craig
(Waterloo), R Eriksson (London Scottish), S Nichol (Selkirk), D Hodge
(Watsonians), S Laing (Instonians), A N Other, G Burns (Stewart's
Melville FP).
Forwards -- M Browne (Melrose), A Kittle (Stewart's Melville FP), M
Scott (Orrell), J Hay (Hawick), A Watt (GHK), S Paul (Heriot's FP), P
Jennings (Boroughmuir), A Macdonald (Heriot's FP), R Scott (London
Scottish), G Dall (Heriot's FP), G Flockhart (Stirling County), S Reid
(Boroughmuir), B Renwick (Hawick), F Wallace (GHK), captain.
Itinerary -- May 31 v Country Districts, at Banket; June 3 v Zimbabwe,
at Bulawayo; June 7 v Zimbabwe A, at Mutare; June 10 v Zimbabwe, at
Harare.

IT was celebration time in Cumbernauld yesterday when Tweedbank's
Joyce Lindores kept the Churchill Insurance Women's World Indoor Singles
Championship in Scotland for the fourth successive year after a
hard-fought five-set final win over Ireland's Margaret Johnston.
Lindores added her name to Scotland's roll of honour after wins in
recent years by Sarah Gourlay, Kate Adams, and Jan Woodley but the
Borders player was pushed all the way by twice former winner.
Lindores got the perfect start when she picked up three shots on the
opening end and added four singles for a 7-0 first-set win but then the
pendulum swung in Johnston's favour. The Ballymoney player, the reigning
world and Commonwealth outdoor champion, recovered from 3-1 down in the
second set with a run of one, one, three, and one giving her a 7-3 win
and successive threes on the third and fourth ends gave her the next set
7-2.
''I knew then I had a battle on my hands but I wasn't too worried -- I
was reasonably happy with the way I was playing and knew if I maintained
my form I still had a good chance,'' said Lindores.
Her confidence was justified when she counted on five of the six ends
played in the fourth set, winning it 7-3, and she then made a great
start in the decider with two singles and a three pushing her 5-0 ahead.
''Things got a bit nervy with Margaret scoring on three of the next
four ends but, fortunately, she was counting only singles and that kept
my cushion intact,'' said Lindores.
She wrapped up the title when a single on the eighth end gave her the
set by 7-3 and completed a 7-0, 3-7, 2-7, 7-3, 7-3 win.
Lindores victory gives her a passport into next February's World
Indoor Championship in Preston.
''I'm not thinking that far ahead but I'm sure I'll enjoy it when it
comes round,'' added the new champion.
In the morning semi-finals, Lindores hit back after a potentially
disastrous start to beat Welsh internationalist Julie Davies in four
sets winning 0-7, 7-6, 7-1, l7-5.
Johnston, the winner of the title in 1988 and, again, the following
year, won through to her fourth final with a 7-6, 6-7, 7-1, 7-1 win over
Guernsey's Anne Simon.

ALTHOUGH Colin Montgomerie broke 70 for the first time in 12 attempts
in the second round of the Masters tournament at the Augusta National
Club yesterday, he was ''disappointed and frustrated'' not to be five or
six strokes over than the total of 140, four under par, he will take
into the weekend's final two rounds.
Ahead of this climax, a one-stroke lead lay in the improbable hands of
a journeyman American professional -- Jay Haas, who had birdies at the
last four holes, an uncharitable act because they give him not only a 64
but a total of 135, nine under par, which helped establish the
qualifying mark at 145, equalling the event's lowest cut.
Sandy Lyle and Miguel Angel Jimenez missed joining the 47 survivors by
a stroke, Ernie Els, the US Open champion, by two, and Nick Price, the
Open and US PGA champion, by four. The seven other European
professionals survived but the international amateur contingent of five,
including the British champion, Lee James, was reduced to one, almost
without saying the American champion, Tiger Woods, after another 72.
''That 69 was the very worst I could have scored,'' Montgomerie said
angrily, perspiration running from him after more than four hours in the
broiling and brilliant sunshine which early in the morning had burned
away the fog that caused the beginning of play to be postponed by 45
minutes.
''My game is very solid from tee to green and it's just a matter of
finishing it off,'' he declared. ''But I've let up to six strokes slip,
including those bogeys at the last two holes on Thursday and at the last
again today.''
Haas was home in 31, five under, as was Scott Hoch, beaten in a
play-off by Nick Faldo six years ago, who holed a pitch for an eagle 3
at the thirteenth and a score of 67 to share second place with John
Huston, another from the game's rank and file.
Ben Crenshaw, the 1984 winner, had a 67 to share fourth place on 137
with two of the overnight leaders, David Frost, the only non-American in
the first 10, and the left-hander, Phil Mickelson. The partnership of
the holder, Jose-Maria Olazabal, and Jack Nicklaus, did nothing for them
as they took eight and 11 strokes more respectively than in their first
rounds of 66 and 67.
Those on 138 included Lee Janzen, the former US Open champion and
recently winner of the Players' Championship; Corey Pavin, rated as one
of the strongest American challengers in advance of the tournament; and
Davis Love, who has certainly made the most so far of his success in
gaining the last possible place in the tournament by having won at New
Orleans.
But European ambitions did not have to be abandoned and, in spite of
his personal dissatisfactions, Montgomerie finds himself in
distinguished company only five strokes behind -- with former winners in
Faldo, Bernhard Langer, and the American, Fred Couples.
The peg upon which Severiano Ballesteros hangs his green jacket proved
less shakily connected than that of Lyle, another former winner. Despite
have a double bogey 7 at the thirteenth, Ballesteros was round in 68 for
a total of 143, one under and secure. But Lyle's bogey at the
seventeenth proved to be terminally damaging and his 71 just one stroke
too many. Qualifiers (American unless stated * denotes amateur):

Hibernian 0, Celtic 0
CELTIC had to suffer the agony of another penalty miss at Ibrox last
night -- ironically at the same goal where Paul McStay cost them the
Coca-Cola Cup final against Raith Rovers earlier this season.
This time the man who missed was Andy Walker -- but Hibs still
protested afterwards with the support of television evidence that the
kick should never have been awarded.
Alex Miller, the Easter Road manager, insisted: ''My players were
adamant that the tackle was outside the penalty box and I'm told that
television has already shown this.''
Miller was right. Television did show that the tackle by Pat McGinlay
on Paul McStay after 73 minutes was outside the 18-yard line. But
referee John Rowbotham decided otherwise, pointed to the spot, and by
doing so set up Walker as the latest Celtic fall guy.
Afterwards, Celtic manager Tommy Burns said: ''There were two of our
players fighting to take the kick -- and that's not a bad thing. We
leave it to the players in form to decide who takes penalties. Walker
wanted to take it, and while John Collins also was ready, it would have
taken a blow torch to take the ball from Andy.
''What happened after that, well, you have to live with that.''
What happened was that Jim Leighton, that in-form veteran, saved the
kick, and Celtic and Hibs return to Ibrox on Tuesday in yet another bid
to find out who will be in the final of the Scottish Cup at the end of
May.
Celtic should be there, not by virtue of a soft penalty, but because
they were the team who demonstrated most that they wanted to be there.
They dictated most of the play. They made the better chances. But,
somehow, there was a vital killer element missing.
And, before the end, their fans who had supported them so well,
recognised that. They began to lose patience and Celtic began to grow
more nervous.
Hibs, of course, had arrived without any great responsibility. Their
fans were outnumbered, and they had been underdogs with the bookies.
When the game began the bookies looked to be, as always, good judges.
Even though manager Burns had thrown yet another change into the
midfield, with Rudi Vata appearing instead of Phil O'Donnell, there were
signs that Celtic were ready to win the game at the first attempt.
After only three minutes Collins had a shot pushed away by Leighton.
And, while there were always sporadic threats from Hibs, the main
pressure came from Celtic.
There were moments of bad temper in the first half, when Darren
Jackson was booked for a foul on Peter Grant, and then Pierre Van
Hooydonk saw the yellow card for a wild challenge on Andy Millen.
Gradually, Hibs began to make moves forward. Keith Wright knocked a
ball down to Pat McGinlay who sent an angled shot wide in 24 minutes,
and then nine minutes after that, Kevin Harper broke clear and sent a
shot which landed on the roof of the net.
Mainly though, as Hibs manager Miller admitted, it was Celtic who did
most of the attacking. ''We did not do enough from midfield to front,''
he said. ''It was our back four who kept us in the game.''
And they did it on several occasions. Always Tweed and Millen seemed
able to combine to clear the thrusts from Celtic.
Hibs relied on counter-attacks. In the second half there was a shot
from Jackson which went wide, and, later another from McGinlay which
whipped by Bonner's post.
However, these openings were always out-numbered by the ones created
by Celtic. There was a header from O'Neil cleared for a corner, a shot
from Collins which was pushed wide by Leighton, and a try from Falconer
which was cleared off the line by Millen.
None of them, however, were enough to ease the pressure which still
hangs over Celtic. They were not helped when Van Hooydonk had to be
substituted three minutes before half-time. He has been a potent threat.
Now because of the hamstring injury he was replaced by Willie Falconer
and could miss the Tuesday replay.
On the other hand Hibs are likely to have skipper Gordon Hunter
available.
Alex Miller, so obviously disappointed by his team's performance,
suggested other changes could be made. ''Micky Weir and Kevin McAllister
could be ready,'' he said. ''They can play in the reserves tomorrow and
then be here on Tuesday. We need something to change things in the area
from midfield to front.''
All Celtic need is a change of luck, or in their confidence, before
they can become the winners Burns wants them to be.
CELTIC -- Bonner, Boyd, McKinlay, Vata, O'Neil, Grant, McLaughlin,
McStay, Van Hooydonk, Walker, Collins. Substitutes -- Falconer,
O'Donnell, Marshall.
HIBERNIAN -- Leighton, Miller, Mitchell, McGinlay, Tweed, Millen,
Harper, Farrell, Wright, Jackson, O'Neill. Substitutes -- Tortolano,
McGraw, Reid.
Referee -- J Rowbotham (Kirkcaldy).
* CELTIC are 6-4 favourites to win the cup following last night's
match at Ibrox. Hibs are on 11-4, Hearts 7-5, with Airdirie the 10-1
outsiders.

SCOTLAND'S David Coulthard grabbed provisional pole position for
tomorrow's Argentine Grand Prix after a dramatic rain-hit day of
practice and qualifying yesterday.
Coulthard, in a Williams, finished half-a-second quicker than his
nearest rival, Frenchman Jean Alesi in a Ferrari, after the leading
drivers diced for grid positions in the final minutes of a session
almost doubled in length because of spins and crashes.
The one hour session actually lasted for slightly more than one hour
and 50 minutes.
German Heinz-Harald Frentzen, in a Sauber, finished third fastest
ahead of Briton Damon Hill in the second Williams.
The flooded Autodromo Oscar Galvez was so treacherous that the
qualifying session was red-flagged to a halt three times following
accidents, but, remarkably, no-one was seriously injured.
Heavy rain, accompanied by thunderstorms and lightning, had turned the
circuit into a quagmire throughout the previous 24 hours and made
several drivers question whether tomorrow's 72-lap race can go ahead in
such conditions.
Coulthard said: ''It's great to have the provisional pole and I am
pleased, but it does not really count for much in the conditions. It
will only really count if I have got pole position on Saturday.''
Earlier in the day, after the two rain-hit practice sessions, the Scot
had warned that because of the heavy rain the circuit was too dangerous
to use for the race.
''I have to say that if the weather conditions stay the same as they
are, this track is unraceable,'' said Coulthard. ''It is frightening to
drive behind other cars and you cannot see anything.'' Practice times:
1, David Coulthard (Britain) Williams 1min 54.670sec (average speed
133.708kph); 2, Jean Alesi (France) Ferrari, 1-55.213; 3, Heinz-Harald
Frentzen (Germany) Sauber, 1-55.583; 4, Damon Hill (Britain) Williams,

FORMER Dundee manager Simon Stainrod has been a thorn in the flesh of
the Dens Park side this season. As Dundee aim for promotion, their claim
for a place next season in the premier division would have been enhanced
but for their unfortunate meetings this season with Stainrod and Ayr
United.
In the three games so far Ayr have won twice and drawn once, but
surely Dundee's chances of laying this particular bogy have been
enhanced this afternoon.
A pensive Stainrod yesterday totted up his injury list and came to a
total of 15. He said: ''If this was caused by strains and sprains I
would be looking closely at our training methods, but that is not the
case for they are all serious injuries.''
Included in that list along with Stainrod himself are Frank Rolling,
Sammy McGivern, Greg Hood, and Vinnie Moore who could all have been
expected to have influential roles today.
Dundee have Kevin Bain, Dusan Vrto, and Jim Hamilton all doubtful, but
manager Jim Duffy was impressing on his players that they must win
against Ayr, the only side this season not to have been beaten by them.
This afternoon revolves around contests between top and bottom clubs.
Raith Rovers, joint top with Dundee, face St Mirren who are trying to
keep ahead of both Ayr and Stranraer in the relegation area.
While Raith manager Jimmy Nicholl has been worried recently about the
performances of his side he readily admits that results are most
important and their midweek win has increased confidence.
But they will find that St Mirren, who are without the suspended
Martin Baker and Jamie Fullarton, are not lacking in that department.
Manager Jimmy Bone observed: ''After a season when luck seems to have
deserted us, we have found that we are getting the breaks necessary to
get points.''
Dunfermline will be without influential defender Neale Cooper for the
rest of the season due to knee ligament damage. In addition, Hamish
French and Tommy Harrison are missing while Dutchman Ivo Den Biemen is
doubtful due to an ankle injury for the visit to Stranraer.
Hamilton will be without Martin McIntosh as they meet St Johnstone,
who have defensive problems with Paul Cherry, Kevin McGowne and Jim Weir
out. Gary McGinnes returns.

WORLD champion Stephen Hendry suffered a shock defeat in the Castella
Classic British Open at Plymouth last night.
The Scot was thrashed 5-1 by Liverpool's John Parrott in the
quarter-finals of the #325,000 event.
Hendry now faces a week of intensive practice before he begins the
defence of his Embassy world crown against Leicester's Stefan Mazrocis
in the opening match at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre next Friday.
Steve Davis' dream of winning the title evaporated when the six-times
world champion lost 5-2 to Scottish teenager John Higgins.
Davis, British Open champion in 1986 and 1993, was always behind
against the Wishaw player, who has already won two ranking tournaments
this season.
Higgins now meets Parrott in the last four.
Earlier in the day, holder Ronnie O'Sullivan and Thailand's world No.3
James Wattana won their quarter-finals and meet in today's first
semi-final in a repeat of last year's British Open final, which
O'Sullivan won 9-4. Quarter-final results:
J Parrott (England) beat S Hendry (Scotland) 5-1; R O'Sullivan
(England) beat D Harold (England) 5-4; J Wattana (Thailand) beat M Price
(England) 5-1; J Higgins (Scotland) beat S Davis (England) 5-2.

HUNTLY'S feverish pursuit of honours means the club is likely to wrap
up its second one within a week this afternoon.
The highlands' dominant side will secure their second consecutive
league title with four games remaining if they secure the expected
victory over Wick Academy.
Last weekend the Strathbogie outfit lifted the Jarlaw Aberdeenshire
Cup, but no silverware will be on show today as the championship trophy
will not be presented until the final day of Huntly's season.
That will ensure the club's fans -- who must be in danger of suffering
celebration fatigue -- should have the opportunity to enjoy themselves
to the full today and then again on April 29.

THE Grand National is Britain's longest race, over the biggest fences,
with the largest number of runners. It also makes more punters take a
tumble than any other.
The safest starting point for those looking for the best horse is last
month's Cheltenham Gold Cup.
Four of the first five home that day meet again in the National, for
which they head the betting market. The absentee is Merry Gale, who
finished fourth at the Festival and franked the form by a convincing win
here on Thursday in the Martell Cup.
Master Oats would be the first horse in 60 years to complete the Gold
Cup-National double, and the 30 fences in the way could be what stops
him repeating Golden Miller's triumph.
Last year the National produced the first fall of his career, and in
the Gold Cup, he put in three jumping errors, any of which would have
brought him down here.
Miinnehoma offers a better bet of completing a double by landing his
second Aintree win. Most of his victories have been over galloping
tracks, like Aintree, and he has proved his ability to tackle the
fences.
Martin Pipe has given him an identical preparation to last year for
his big target, and he finished further up the field in this year's Gold
Cup.
Those who are looking for each-way value could find it in Topsham Bay,
who is a firm-ground specialist and comes to hand in the spring.
Danoli heads a strong Irish challenge for the Martell Aintree Hurdle,
a race he won easily last year. The extra half mile clearly suited him
that day and he looks set to use his superior stamina to reverse
Champion Hurdle form with Large Action, who was beaten when trying this
trip a year ago.
Front-running Mysilv, fifth in the champion, would appreciate the
better ground but may use up too much energy before the finish. By
contrast, Dorans Pride will certainly last the distance, but may not
have the pace to go with Danoli.
The Martell Aintree Chase can go to Uncle Ernie, always at his best in
the spring. He put in a great run to be fourth in the Champion Chase and
that form was franked when the first two, Viking Flagship and Deep
Sensation, were first and second in yesterday's big race here.
Uncle Ernie also was a winner here last year and could make today
remembered by a hat trick of repeat victories.
Batabanoo was a fine third to Large Action at Kelso in February and
should be too good for his rivals in the Cordon Bleu Hurdle.

THE Grand National may be the main attraction this afternoon but
punters looking for some ammunition for the big one should not look past
the fast ground specialist Egypt Mill Prince, who has everything in his
favour in the two-mile Martell Aintree Chase.
The nine-year-old is one of the quickest jumpers in training and will
take plenty of pegging back off his low weight.
Trainer Peter Easterby can collect the Cordon Bleu Handicap Hurdle
with Cumbrian Challenge. He has had the six-year-old primed for big-race
success for some time, only for soft ground to rule him out of the
Imperial Cup at Sandown and Cheltenham's County Hurdle.
The recent change in the weather has come just in time for Cumbrian
Challenge who will be seen to good effect in what is sure to be a
strongly-run race.
But what of the big one, the National?
Master Oats really looks a cracking bet to make history in the race.
The nine-year-old has outstanding claims yet the bookmakers have been
lengthening his odds all week. Spurious interpretations of history and
the weather have been the prime reasons for Master Oats's drift in the
betting.
The fact that no Gold Cup winner since Golden Miller in '34 has gone
on to triumph at Aintree is often used to illustrate the toughness of
his task. But only 10 have attempted the feat, most at the end of an
arduous season -- Master Oats has had a light campaign which was
originally geared to this race rather than the Gold Cup.
And few had demonstrated such superiority over their rivals at
Cheltenham as Master Oats who cruised to a 15-length triumph over
Dubacilla last month, with no other rival within 30 lengths and no
obvious excuses for his opponents.

THEY will not be doing any laps of honour at Ibrox this afternoon,
whatever happens in their premier division meeting with Aberdeen.
Rangers made it clear yesterday that their aim is to win their next two
games before they can consider celebrating their seventh successive
championship. If all goes to plan, next Sunday's confrontation with Hibs
at Ibrox could be the day the champions get the opportunity to have an
after-match party.
In the meantime, manager Walter Smith has to decide if today is the
moment to bring back his star striker, Mark Hateley, who has been out of
action since he played against Aberdeen on February 12. Hateley has been
recovering from a groin injury but, although he is fully fit again,
Smith has to make the awkward judgment about whether he is quite ready
for a game that will be as competitive as any between the sides over the
years.
The difference this time is that, instead of being a top-of-the-table
meeting, this match is one of desperate survival proportions for the
northern team. However, Smith did not want that aspect to have any
bearing on his thoughts because there is a championship to be won. His
decision on Hateley will be influenced by the fitness of Gordon Durie,
who is rated doubtful after suffering a hamstring injury last week.
If he is not fit, the temptation to use Hateley would be considerable.
''It is another Saturday team decision, as it has been all season,''
said the manager. ''As far as Hateley is concerned, we would not want to
take any chances with him but in the situation we are in he could be an
option.''
Better news is that Basile Boli and John Brown are fit to play. Trevor
Steven also has a chance. ''We didn't play well at Tannadice last week
but we did defend well,'' said Smith, who will give keeper Billy Thomson
his first game as a Rangers player at Ibrox, after he did well at
Tannadice.
It is three-and-a-half years since Aberdeen beat Rangers in Glasgow,
but defender John Inglis insists that can be changed this time. ''I feel
we are turning the corner and am very confident about the five games
which follow the one at Ibrox,'' he said. ''If we ever want to beat
Rangers at Ibrox now is the time. This would be a major boost in our
battle to beat the relegation.''
Caretaker manager Roy Aitken hopes that a flu outbreak will not have
any further effects on the side after full back Colin Woodthorpe had to
be sent home yesterday.
Partick Thistle, the team who have sent shivers down a host of others
as they continue to cling on to their survival raft, will be formidable
and enthusiastic opponents for Motherwell at Fir Park after their win
over Hearts in midweek. Manager John Lambie is likely to leave the team
as it was then.
Dundee United, who will be very much interested in that result, as
well as the one at Ibrox, have problems for their own crucial visit to
Brockville. They will be without injured striker Craig Brewster and
suspended midfielder David Hannah.
Motherwell, incidentally, are looking for bumper crowds for their
games against Thistle and Aberdeen, and they will let schoolchildren
into Fir Park free today for the clash against Partick.
Commercial manager John Swinburne explained: ''This is part of a
scheme to promote football in Lanarkshire among youngsters.''
On Tuesday week, Motherwell will open their new stand when
bottom-of-the-table Aberdeen are at Fir Park.

ONLY 90 minutes and Airdrie stand between Hearts and a financial
jackpot which could have an immense influence on the future of the club,
on and off the park. If the Tynecastle team beat their first division
opponents in the Tennents Scottish Cup semi-final at Hampden today, the
club is in line to pick up a cash reward close to #500,000.
With the second phase of their stadium refurbishment to be tackled,
not to mention the declaration by manager Tommy McLean that he needs
real money to improve the team, the importance of that kind of bonus can
hardly be over-emphasised.
It is made up of money from the tournament sponsors, television and
gate receipts and a special bonus arranged two years ago when two of the
club sponsors agreed a cup deal which would guarantee Hearts an extra
#150,000 if they reached the final. Brewers Strongbow, the main club
sponsors, promised #100,000, and sportswear firm Asics, who have
supplied the cup kit, #50,000 if the team made it to the final.
When the pooled gates for the semi-finals are distributed, it will
probably be worth #100,000 to each club, while the finalists can both
anticipate a cheque of around #250,000. The total could provide chairman
Chris Robinson with a major lift as he tackles the club's financial
problems.
The chances of him sporting a grin as broad as the Tynecastle dug-out
when the show at Hampden is over could depend on whether Hearts match
what will certainly be an Airdrie side prepared to run until they drop,
get up and start again. It looks almost certain, too, that Hearts will
have to tackle the job without their first choice keeper, Craig Nelson,
in which case 39-year-old Henry Smith will be called into the spotlight
only a few days after his blunder allowed Partick Thistle to climb back
into the league game with them at Firhill.
Smith, the first player signed under former chairman Wallace Mercer,
has been at Tynecastle for 14 years, has been challenged and overtaken
as the top side goalie many times during that period, but has always
fought back to regain his position. The error against Thistle might have
undermined the confidence of a less experienced or pragmatic man but
Smith is unlikely to let it worry him.
Manager Tommy McLean has no doubts about the difficulty of the job his
team face but, equally, believes that Hearts have a fine chance to reach
the big finale next month. He and his opposite number, Alex MacDonald,
were great pals in their Ibrox days and are still friendly but there
will be no exchanges of merry banter in the dug-outs.
There is too much at stake, and concentration on the job will be
essential, considering the rewards if they succeed. Airdrie, beaten by
Raith Rovers in the semi-final of the Coca-Cola Cup, would love to
emulate the Fife team's success in that tournament and make it a
remarkable season when two first division teams lifted the main cups.
They have a long way to go yet, but the spirit in the camp is as
buoyant as ever. Striker Steve Cooper describes it rather differently.
''They are the daftest bunch I have ever known,'' he said. ''I get
plenty of stick for being English, but I can hold my own.''
Striker Cooper, who scored in that Coca-Cola semi-final, admitted that
he didn't really appreciate the magnitude of the Scottish Cup until the
hype began after Airdrie reached the last four, but now he knows what
winning would mean to his career. The man was completely surprised when
his club, York City, asked him if he would like to join Airdrie last
October but is glad they did.
He and his mates will be well prepared for a tie to which manager
MacDonald has been patently looking forward with confidence, because his
players will have the benefit of a big crowd and atmosphere that has
been lacking from their games this season. The same club and same
manager knocked out Hearts at the same stage in the same tournament
three years ago. It is not beyond them to do it again.

I MUST have nabbed just about the last ticket available for the London
Symphony Orchestra's Mahler Festival concert at the Barbican, where the
LSO with its principal conductor Michael Tilson Thomas was playing
Mahler's massive Ninth Symphony.
Okay, so Tilson Thomas is a bit of a cool cookie, all brisk and
brusque efficiency, not really giving the symphony the chance to spread
its enormous limbs. But the LSO was in awesome form: electrifyingly
virtuosic playing in every department, astonishing discipline and a
balance of sound within every section that showed in a million details
and suggested a quality that could have come straight out of the
recording studio. And, despite Tilson Thomas's businesslike approach,
not at all soulless.
And another thing. Mahler's Ninth, of heavenly length, often sits on
its own in a concert. Those who are always complaining about lack of
value for money in orchestral programmes might like to note that the
symphony was just the second half in a full programme that also
contained the UK premiere of Takemitsu's Ceremonial, a ravishing,
ritualistic piece that featured the Sho -- Japanese reed pipes -- and an
exquisite rainbow of orchestral sound, rising from the stage and
spraying down from woodwind groups high in the Barbican balconies. The
sound, somewhere between Ravel and Messiaen, was utterly gorgeous.
(Check out this piece, Royal SNO.)
But not only that. There was also Dame Moura Lympany, 79 and still
going -- well, not strong, but effortlessly musical -- in Weber's
Konzertstuck. See value for money?
Less value was the opening concert of a UK tour by the Rotterdam
Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall. Under conductor Claus
Peter Flor, their first half was a sleepy, lacklustre affair with
Beethoven's Leonore no 2 Overture (which lasted 15 minutes and went on
all night) and a characterless performance of Mozart's K488 A major
Piano Concerto with Andreas Haefliger.
Then, in the second half, the band kicked ass with a stunning
performance of Shostakovich's Tenth Symphony that displayed real
control, a quality sound (grainy, not polished) and some lacerating,
incisive attack. Gripping stuff, played with ferocious commitment. They
have a new principal conductor about to take up post -- the Kirov's
superb Valery Gergiev. When he gets his hands on them I would suggest
watching out for this lot. They're not world class, but there's a real
potential there.

BATTLE hardened Viking Flagship upstaged an old foe and a young
upstart yesterday in one of the most exciting races ever seen at
Aintree.
Viking Flagship's never-say-die spirit, coupled with the determination
of jockey Adrian Maguire, saw him emerge triumphant from Deep Sensation
and Martha's Son in a breathtaking conclusion to the #60,000-added Mumm
Melling Chase.
Approaching the final fence, Martha's Son, the 11-10 favourite, and
Deep Sensation were locked together, with Viking Flagship about half a
length behind.
Deep Sensation forced his way to the front after jumping the last but
Viking Flagship responded positively to Maguire's urgings to pip Deep
Sensation by a short-head with Martha's Son one length back.
Trainer David Nicholson admitted: ''That is simply the best ride a
jockey could have given a horse.''
Maguire said: ''If I ever came back in another life I'd like to come
back as Viking Flagship -- he's a champion.
''He kept sticking his neck out for me on the run-in and I thought I'd
won by a head but when I saw the freeze frame I wasn't so sure.''
Richard Dunwoody banished his injury blues as Banjo romped home in the
Mumm Mildmay Novices' Chase.
The champion jockey shrugged off the pain from his troublesome left
knee to steer Martin Pipe's gelding to a 14-length defeat of Kadi.

SCOTLAND'S lightweight sculling champion, Peter Haining, starts his
1995 season today by defending the Scullers' Head of the River Race
title over the four-and-a-quarter miles of the Thames between Mortlake
and Putney, the University Boat Race course in reverse.
Last year, Haining became the first sculler to beat 17 minutes for
this event, not a bad time when compared with the 18 minutes-plus posted
on the same waters last week by Cambridge's winning eight.
For this season Haining has followed the same pattern that has brought
him success in the past. He has only recently returned from an intensive
training camp in Hong Kong, and will attempt to retain the Wingfield
Sculls, another long-distance race on the Thames, before going on to the
European circuit as preparation for the World championships in Finland
in August.
Guy Pooley, of Leander, who will start second, is Haining's main rival
this weekend, while Stirling's Kevin Plank, winner in Glasgow last
weekend, is the next Scottish sculler, starting at thirty-eighth.

IT is that time again, time to pull down the goggles, take a deep
breath, and get set for the greatest horse show on earth. Nothing
devised in sport since Lottery won the first Grand National in 1839 has
been able to match the spectacle, the drama, the thrills, or even the
controversy that this marathon test of chaser and jockey has engendered,
nor is it likely.
From captain Becher's scurry into a brook to avoid flying hooves,
through the great Foinavon farce of the sixties, up to the nineties'
race-that-never-was, the National has never failed to startle.
For the past few weeks it had seemed that we had a marvellous chance
of being treated to a historic, 1995 version as Master Oats, the new
superstar of the chasing world, prepared to try to add the National to
the blue riband of the business, the Cheltenham Gold Cup, in the same
season.
Not before or since 1934 has this extraordinary feat been achieved,
when one of racing's legendary horses, Golden Miller, did what had
seemed close to impossible, considering the little time available
between the races to allow a horse to recover.
Many have tried since that day, but none has succeeded. The Miller
himself attempted it twice more but failed, while Prince Regent (1946)
and Garrison Savanah (1991) made valiant efforts, as did The Fellow last
year and Cool Ground the previous season.
If Master Oats achieves the feat he will go down in the record books
as one of the all-time greats.
Until the last few days that looked a likely scenario. The horse has
beenraced only four times this season, has improved with every run, is
clearly the best chaser in the field, and on any other course would have
no difficulty at all in conceding weight to the rest of the 34
contenders.
The snag is that all the wonderful exploits of trainer Kim Bailey's
champion have been on soft to heavy ground. He is not about to get those
conditions at Aintree, where the weather has been dry and the course
getting faster and firmer by the day.
Bailey has remained undeterred, insisting that the horse will take his
chance as long as the going is not jarring, describes Master Oats in
better form than before his impressive Cheltenham victory, and believes
all that is needed now is luck.
The fact that Young Hustler, a fast-ground horse who could only have
seen the back of Master Oats by telescope when he finished fifth in the
Gold Cup, has been all the betting rage this week indicates that
confidence from outwith the Bailey stable is on the wane.
If the National is often accused of being a day out for plodders, that
cannot be valid this year as the first three home the Gold Cup three
weeks ago again take their chance.
If there were no complicating factors, like the 30 toughest fences in
the world, this long-distance handicap chase, which is basically all it
is, the race would be straightforward for this trio, Master Oats,
Dubacilla, and Miinnehoma. The latter pair are also better on soft
goound.
It was that way when Miinnehoma won the race last year but, even if
the conditions are different and he carries 10lb more, look out for him
running another big race.
When you move away from the candidates at the top of the handicap,
there are a host of optimists, many of whose horses would be hard pushed
to catch Master Oats if he was pulling a bus, but that will not prevent
owners, trainers, and jockeys going for the greater glory that has been
the lot of the aforesaid Foinavon (1967), and three others, Tipperary
Tim (1928), Gregalach (1929), and Caughoo (1947), all 100-1 shots.
On rational form, horses like Lusty Light, who will like the ground,
is a fine jumper, and might stay the trip, Crystal Spirit, another who
will be happy with the going, Country Member, who has been well backed,
and Party Politics, the winner two years ago, ought to have chances.
The bravest man in the race could be 28-year-old West Cork man Sean
O'Donovan, who rides the Irish-trained, Nuaffe, yet he has genuine
prospects of winning, if the horse stays on his feet.
This 10-year-old is one of the few in with a serious chance on the
handicap, but he has a terrifying habit of treating fences with some
disdain, a trait upon which Old Mother Aintree does not look kindly.
Sometimes the degree of difficulty of the Liverpool fences forces such
horses to behave with respect, and if that does happen, Sean could have
one exciting day.
So will the rest of us, at the course or watching on the box,
wondering whether our contribution to the #84m betting gambled on the
event will be lost yet again. May your own choice do you proud but, more
important, may all the gallant horses and their equally gallant jocks
come back safely.

ALAN Hill conquered the National fences on Sheer Jest yesterday for
the second time in eight years to take the Fox Hunters' Chase.
The 6ft 4in. amateur, successful in 1987 on Border Burg, clung to the
inside rail throughout. ''I didn't set out to go around the inside,'' he
said, ''but Sheer Jest was travelling well enough going to Becher's, so
I decided to stay there.''
''I had a perfect ride around apart from a horse going across me at
the start, and it is really lovely ground out there -- ideal conditions
for the big race.''
Mary Reveley's consistent Morgan's Harbour landed the Sefton Novices'
Hurdle with a fine late burst under Scots rider Peter Niven, getting up
in the last stride to pip Jack Button, who had appeared to have the
prize sewn up with 200 yards to travel.
Squire Silk produced a smooth display in the Oddbins Hurdle to score
by one and three quarter lengths from Taroudant, stopping the Reveley
team from landing a quick-fire double.

<HEADLINE>Scottish Consumer Council urges reform. Scots pay twice for CAP</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>28</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978993286</RECORDNO>

SOCIAL, environmental and rural objectives should be considered
alongside agricultural issues within the Common Agricultural Policy, the
Scottish Consumer Council has told the House of Commons Scottish Affairs
Committee.
In its contribution to the committee's consideration of the future for
Scottish agriculture the council calls for continued reform of the CAP
which it sees as ''a major issue of consumer concern''.
Scottish consumers, like all their European counterparts, have the
privilege of paying for the CAP twice -- once through their taxes and
again in terms of higher prices, said the council in its written
submission.
''Scottish consumers have a strong interest in the reform of the
CAP,'' said council chairman Mrs Deidre Hutton. ''Scotland has a higher
proportion of the population living on low incomess than the rest of the
UK and the CAP -- which acts as a food tax -- hits low-income consumers
the hardest since they spend a higher proportion of their income on
food.''
One effect of the CAP was to promote some of the less healthy food
products she said, citing the provision of subsidised butter to schools
as one example. The mechanisms relating to fruit and vegetables kept
prices artificially high and did little to encourage their consumption,
particularly by people on low incomes who were restricted in their
choices.
The council's submission claims that the MacSharry reforms to the CAP
did not go far enough. ''The reductions in the farm support prices are
inadequate,'' said the council. ''Over-production in European
agriculture is still occurring, demonstrating that prices are still too
high. This continuing over-production leads to a perceived need for
quotas and set-aside arrangements to reduce output.''
However, the council argues that set-aside is not working and may, in
fact, have a damaging effect on the environment. Reports, it said,
indicate that some set-aside land is not put to environmentally-friendly
use; the least productive land is set-aside and production on the
remaining land may intensify.
''The Scottish Consumer Council considers that direct aid to farmers
and others in the rural economy should be channelled through the
Structural Fund and not through the indiscriminate mechanisms of the CAP
under the MacSharry reforms,'' said the submission.
''Public funding of agriculture in the form of direct payments to
farmers to achieve certain environmental objectives would be more
acceptable to consumers than the current form of support.'' It sets out
several prerequisites for protecting the rural environment:
* All new agricultural policies should be subject to environmental
impact assessments.
* Consistency between agricultural, environmental and rural objectives
should be accepted as essential.
* Environmental goals should not be an add-on to agricultural policies
which are aimed at maintaining farm incomes or reducing farm output.
* Legislation should be introduced to penalise agricultural practices
which damage the environment.

REGULATORY rigmarole reared its muddled head again recently,
highlighting the thorny question of who should pay up when things go
wrong.
At the heart of the latest round of arguments are home income plans
which allow older people to unlock the wealth tied up in the value of
their homes. These plans underline the problems that can occur when a
financial product does not fit neatly in any category.
Home income plans appear to solve many problems for older house
owners, but because they involve both a loan and an investment they are
difficult to categorise for the purposes of financial regulation.
Last week there were harsh words between members of an all-party
Treasury select committee investigating the effectiveness of investor
protection and representatives of a building society involved in
providing the finance for a type of home income plan which has now been
outlawed.
Brian Sedgemore, a Labour MP on the committee, is reported to have
branded the West Bromwich Albion building society's behaviour in the
fiasco ''odious and disgraceful''. The society, in turn, has issued a
writ against Fimbra, the old regulator of financial advisers, for libel.
This particular argument is over who should pay for a home income scheme
which went disastrously wrong.
Traditional home income plans raise money against the value of a home
and invest the money safely to provide an income. If both the interest
on the loan and the income are fixed there should be no problem. But in
the late eighties some elderly people became involved in schemes where
neither side of the equation was safe.
Using their homes as security, they raised money in the form of a
mortgage. The money was put into investment bonds, linked to the
stockmarket, and interest on the loans was rolled up rather than having
to be repaid each month. When interest rates rocketed and investment
returns plunged, thousands of home owners were left with no means of
repaying the interest debt they had built up without losing their homes
in the process.
The Investors' Compensation Scheme has paid out #27m to the victims,
but it says that the building societies who provided the loans for these
plans should contribute to the compensation too.
The arguments centre on just how involved the societies were in
promoting this type of plan, which was outlawed by the regulatory
authorities in 1990. The societies say they were just providing the
finance -- mortgages are not covered by the Financial Services Act. But
regulators say societies were actively promoting these schemes to
borrowers and should share some of the blame.
While the row rages on, there are still likely to be thousands of
older householders who could benefit from a safe home income plan. They
may be struggling to get by on small pensions and limited savings while
living in a home that is all paid for and now worth many thousands of
pounds. Indeed, the value of privately owned homes that are free of
mortgage has been estimated at more than #300bn -- so the cash that
could potentially be released by these plans is enormous.
Traditional schemes allow home owners to raise a loan based on the
value of their property and then use the money to buy an annuity. This
annuity provides a stream of income for the rest of the person's life,
and it not only covers the interest payments on the loan but provides
extra spending money as well.
Variations on the theme allow home owners to raise an initial cash
lump sum in return for a lower regular income. There are also
''reversion'' schemes. Here, instead of using the money raised to buy an
annuity, you sell all or part of your home to a company and continue to
live in it as a tenant rather than an owner. You remain responsible for
repairs and maintenance and have to pay a small rent. Your home
effectively becomes part of a property fund and the income you receive
depends on the value of it and the other homes within that fund. This
can go down as well as up.
The big drawback of both types of scheme is that only single people
over 65 or married couples where both are over 70 stand to raise a
realistic income, because what you receive depends on your life
expectancy. To be blunt, the sooner you are likely to shuffle off this
mortal coil the higher the income you will receive, because the company
involved knows it won't have to keep on paying for very long.
A challenge for the future will be to devise schemes that can benefit
more people, particularly those forced into early retirement through
redundancy or ill health and those who have only a reduced State pension
to look foward to.

<HEADLINE>Scottish potato industry facing uncertain future</HEADLINE>

THE Scottish potato industry, which has declined over the years, faces
an uncertain future. That was the conclusion after meetings this week in
which Potato Marketing Board chairman John Heading addressed Scottish
growers
The background was the Government's decision that the PMB should be
phased out at the end of the 1996 marketing year which effectively means
early summer 1997.
Farmers were clearly apprehensive as to their future but John Heading
gave a polished performance in his address. He said: ''We have to make
up our minds what our vision of the future will be and where we intend
to go. The British potato industry has enjoyed a good year in 1994-95
with high prices and we are ready to attack new markets.''
The basis of Mr Heading's proposals are that the PMB should be
replaced by a new organisation which will be called the Great Britain
Potato Organisation. The funding of this will come from both growers and
the trade.
The intention is to raise levies from growers to accommodate a budget
of around #6m which will be less than half of the #13m bill when the PMB
was operating with a full intervention buying programme. That could mean
growers paying not more than #35 per hectare (the 1995 levy is #45). The
trade would be expected to contribute about 20p per tonne handled.
On the important matter of the possible introduction of a European
potato regime, Mr Heading said: ''It is very necessary to campaign for
fair conditions to prevent state aid distorting trading conditions. It
is vital that our arrangements are compatible with the EU. We cannot
countenance giving up quota to find our competitors getting ad hoc
support.''
He doubted that there was any chance of the UK Government allowing
potato quotas to continue following the end of the long-established
marketing scheme. The subsequent question-and-answer session showed that
Scottish growers are clearly far from happy at the prospects of a new
arrangement which looks set to leave them remote from the market.
Bob Mitchell, who farms just outside Perth, raised the question of the
willingness of some European states to stand by the rules. Mr Heading,
in response, admitted that this would be a big problem, pointing to the
fact that some Italian potato processors had been in receipt of
subsidies from their government recently of as much as #40 per tonne.

<HEADLINE>Why it pays to be clear about PEPs</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>KEN CLAY</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>24</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978993289</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
IF events were entirely predictable it would seem reasonable to expect
that before very long a war of words would break out between the
managers of the new bond PEPs and those running the existing high yield
variety.
We are unlikely, however, to see this for the simple reason that most
management groups which will be offering the bond PEPs also have high
yield versions in their stable. Any knocking is most likely to be
directed at investments in building societies.
Although the latter will generally be favoured by investors who shy
away from anything with the slightest sniff of risk, managers of the new
and old PEPs will be pointing out that they should give better returns
than the societies. They will probably be right, but investors should be
clear in their own minds what they are aiming for and what they are
likely to be getting.
There will be an important difference between the bond and the high
yield share-based PEPs. Those based on bonds are likely to offer higher
immediate rates of return and, because they will be based on
fixed-interest securities, if interest rates fall their returns will not
suffer, which is not the case with variable rate deposits with building
societies or banks.
The high yield PEPs do, however, have a strong long-term appeal. In
both cases you have to be a bit wary if exceptionally high yields are on
offer because these usually go hand-in-hand with higher risks. But the
existing high yield PEPs based on investments in shares, or mainly in
shares with the yields spiced up a bit with bonds, do seem to offer
better long-term prospects for growth of capital.
Unfortunately, picking a high yielding share which is likely to
continue paying its dividends and hopefully show some growth as well is
not a simple matter. A high yield is often a warning that the dividend
may be cut or that a firm's prospects are not too bright.
Michael Ashbridge of Flemings Investment Management, who specialises
in this type of investment, comments that while investors want a high
dividend they also want to see some growth of capital. So when he looks
at a company whose shares stand on a high yield one question he asks is:
''Is it paying out in dividends money which really should be invested in
the business?'' A high dividend yield alone is not enough to tempt him.
He needs to see some prospect of a turning point for change.
In reviewing the market he puts together an ''income universe''
listing all stocks standing on a yield at or above the market average.
He then looks at income sectors. The banks, for instance, may account
for 8.9% of the market as a whole but 13% of the income stocks. ''This
brings to our attention all the high yields,'' he says. ''We then go
through them to look at the value there.''
He recalls that a while ago the food retailers looked interesting.
They had high yields because the market was worrying about the prospect
of cut-price competition from discounters. He felt, however, that even
if margins were reduced the companies would still have good cash flow to
pay their dividends. A turning point came when Tesco said it would not
be building as many new stores as had been expected, a signal its
emphasis on expansion had changed.
Currently, he likes pharmaceuticals, where Glaxo's acquisition of
Wellcome should mean a lower cost base and ''cash will come back to the
investor''.
Mr Ashbridge admits investors have to work quite hard to press home
the point that cash should come back to them. This is a trend in the US
which he would like to see more of here. He worries the ''natural urge''
of directors of companies which are piling up cash is to ''go out and
buy something'' rather than return the money to investors.
One signal which makes him look a bit harder at a company is when it
changes its name, particularly if the new one indicates a departure from
traditional business areas.
He now plans to watch the banks, because he says: ''They are piling up
cash which is well ahead of what they need. The question is will they
return it?''
In the past couple of years investment decisions were based on trying
to identify good value in companies. ''This worked well as we came out
of recession. Lots were undervalued.'' But the high yield investor's
search for value has continued to work, he adds.
Running a high yield fund imposes its own disciplines. If a share
price recovers to the point where it is priced to give a below average
yield and is attracting the attention of growth funds the high yield
investor sells.
Chris Burvill at Guinness Flight, who picks shares for the Temple Bar
Investment Trust, has a similar philosophy. ''If you buy a company for a
high yield something has to change if it is to be a success. The high
yield is there because the market does not see it as having growth
prospects. Knowing the companies and recognising those which are
under-valued allows a fund manager to pick stocks which offer high
yields at low risks.''
He cites the example of Blue Circle, which could have been bought on a
10% yield but is now priced on a 5% yield basis. ''When the market
realises a share is under-valued and starts buying, the price moves up.
Income fund managers then aim to sell having had the best of both worlds
-- a high yield and capital growth.''
He counsels against being too much influenced by the warning implied
by a high yield and emphasises the need for the ''value'' approach. He
admits things can go wrong, but at the moment he likes the look of the
insurance sector where investors may be worrying overly about
competition.

CITIBANK has launched a new banking service which will offer interest
of up to 6.5% gross on current accounts. This rate is only available on
balances exceeding #50,000. The next tier down, from #10,000, pays 5.5%,
and from #2000 4.5%. Below #2000 it is 0.5%.
Account holders must have income of #30,000 and over or make an
initial deposit of #10,000. There are no bank charges so long as the
average balance across the current and any savings accounts is #2000 or
more. A free overdraft facility of up to #500 is available, with larger
amounts if required. Citibank says accounts can be accessed by visiting
a branch or at any time by telephone or card through a cash dispenser.
The card also acts as a cheque guarantee and a debit card. In
addition, customers will receive a Visa gold card which incorporates a
colour photograph of the holder. For the telephone service calls are
free and the customer has the choice of either an automated voice
response or speaking to a member of Citibank staff.

TODAY is amateur day at the bookmakers. The Grand National, a British
institution which regularly throws up a fairytale result, brings out
millions of once-a-year punters, and they will wager as much as #85m on
the world's greatest betting race.
The growling regular punters sneer at the blue rinse women from the
suburbs who shuffle self-consciously into the betting shop with a string
of selections nearly as long as their grocery list.
They concentrate intently on their betting slips, and stand patiently
in a queue as the hordes barge past to bet on the more mundane tests of
stamina and strength.
The choices of the one-off punters rarely have anything to do with
form, the going, or even the horse's ability to jump.
More often it will be a horse with a particular personal association.
They may simply plump for the favourite, usually a bad choice as fewer
than 10 have won this century. As a last resort, the selection will be
made with the aid of a sharp pin.
As a child my family, like so many others, had an annual investment at
Aintree. We chose our hopefuls for all kinds of bizarre reasons.
One year my mother noticed a horse in the field which was named after
a mountain in her native Sutherland. She could not be persuaded that at
such long odds it would still be running the following year. My father
was dispatched to place a #1 bet for each of us on his way to a meeting.
We settled down to follow our horses' fortunes. We watched a pile-up
at the twenty-third fence in horror and then shouted on my mother's
''no-hoper'' as it avoided the others to slog its way home a 100-1
winner in the 1967 National.
She crowed about Foinavon's success and we waited for my father to
return with her windfall. Like so many good-luck stories there was a
hard luck conclusion.
He returned unaware of the result, only to confess, sheepishly, that
he had decided to put her wager on the favourite. Such is the stuff of
family legends.
Today's field has a number of runners that might have associations for
an assortment of celebrities.
Beleaguered Barings trader Nick Leeson might opt for Into the Red;
Jumbeau appears heaven sent for Baywatch's Pamela Anderson; and It's A
Snip might have been named for the unfortunate, John Wayne Bobbit.
There are a clutch of runners with royal connotations.
For William is bound to appeal to the feuding Wales's, Royal Athlete
is designed for the Duchess of York, because of her ability as a skier,
of course, and Superior Finish might attract her, too.
Politicians, too, have a few apposite runners. Do Be Brief could teach
Neil Kinnock a thing or two, and there are a string of possible backers
for Master Oats, but David Mellor remains the favourite.
In the original line-up, I had hoped to place a modest investment on
Scribbler but it's no longer running. Instead I'll have to go for
Dubacilla. After all, this competitor is a tough old mare and surprise,
surprise she might even win.

AGRICULTURAL contractors have condemned new regulations expected to be
introduced by the European Commission as a ''snooper's charter'' which
will force them to disclose details of seed which has been ''saved'' on
farm for future sowing.
The practice is widespread on all combinable crops, including wheat,
barley oats and rape. Suitable potatoes are also often held back as
seed.
Professional plant breeders, however, see farm-saved seed as a threat
to their future income and claim that investment in research and
development of new varieties is hampered if their royalty income is
depleted by farmers saving seed from harvested crops.
They are seeking an arrangement where users of farm-saved seed would
still have to pay a royalty -- although at a lower level than if they
had bought in new seed.
The National Association of Agricultural Contractors, which is
awaiting the outcome of meetings in Brussels next week, claim that the
curbs being considered would allow breeders to snoop on farmers' and
contractors' business records so that licence holders could pocket
royalties on farm-saved seed.
They fear that there would be an obligation to provide seed breeders
with information on species and varieties of seed used, going back as
far as three years. Farmers would be asked to disclose details of
contractors who had processed their farm-saved seed and contractors
would be called on to hand over a list of farmers for whom they had
provided a service.
''The draft regulations are monstrous,'' said Tim Rogers of the
contractors' association. ''The contractors fear is that the royalty
regulations will become so burdensome that many farmers will simply opt
out of using farm-saved seed altogether.
''Mobile seed-cleaning contractors will go out of business and farmers
will be denied the opportunity of using a highly-competent and
professional service,'' said Mr Rogers.

DOES Tony Meehan really believe that every PR consultant who is
neither a Public Relations Consultants Association member nor a member
of the Institute of Public Relations is a rogue? (Soapbox, March 30).
His inference throughout is that if you do not belong to one of these
organisations (and 43,000 do not), then you are not equipped to offer a
professional PR consultancy service.
This occasional criticism of non-PRCA registered firms and those who
do not subscribe to the IPR by the representatives of those that do is
becoming increasingly tedious. Is this an attempt by them to clean up
the industry, to raise quality standards, and to recruit new members, or
is it a cry of not fair that those who do not belong can win clients and
be successful? I suspect it is the latter.
It certainly doesn't persuade me to join either body. Until recently,
all you needed to join the IPR was a few years' experience, proposer(s),
and a bank account. Only in the last two years has this organisation
incorporated an assessment of a candidate's capability and understanding
of the industry.
Do those shifting entry criteria really build credibility for the
organisation?
As for the SPRCA, how is it attempting to encourage non-members to
join? Do non-members receive information encouraging them to sign up?
Will every professional, decent PR firm (no matter its size, turnover,
or length of time in business) or single practitioner fulfil the entry
criteria for this organisation?
The SPRCA is less quango than cabal. It suits its members to be a
clique, a self-appointed elite. It allows them to profess that they are
the best, and all else are not fit to practise.
We, like many other non-registered firms, respect and retain all
client information of a confidential nature. That is a moral and
professional issue.
I am fully supportive of any campaign for high professional standards
in PR and delivering a quality service -- as are many other
practitioners who do not belong. At the end of the day, however, the
service you provide and your ability to provide it is judged by the
clients, whether or not you have letters after your name or a badge on
your letterhead.

The debate on sleeper services to the West Highlands does not pick up
on a facility lost through the elimination of seats on many of the
services. That was a sensible start-of-day arrival at the end of your
journey and a good late departure for the return.
With improved performance of new lightweight trains and centralised
radio signalling over great distances the ability to run services which
leave Edinburgh, Glasgow, Oban or Mallaig and reach the destination
before 10.00 (ideally 09.00) means a start as late as 06.00 can be
achieved in many instances.
Lack of this facility leads many to drive or go by bus, or in the case
of Inverness try for the hit-or-miss connection via Aberdeen (the old
overnight direct service having been dropped some years ago).
Even services south from Glasgow dry up by 18.30, and the overnight
services no longer officially call at Carlisle and other useful points.
For example, the call at Crewe gave excellent connections for Derby and
the East Midlands, as well as Manchester and North Wales, without the
longer drag of a journey into London usually at a peak time.
I'm grudgingly catching the overnight bus to Birmingham because of
this and have frequently had similar treks through the lack of rail
services.
Could this extended normal day with additional services, connecting
with those from the South, be a feature of the new timetable if we are
denied the more civilised through sleeper service?

THE collapse of the Tories in Scotland rivalled that of the Barings
bank, it was claimed yesterday by the Scottish Liberal Democrats.
They said that the Government had run out of steam, run out of ideas
and now had to be run out of office nationally as well as locally.
''It can start with the Perth and Kinross by-election,'' SLD leader Mr
Jim Wallace said, maintaining he would be spending a happier Easter than
the Prime Minister, who now had four weeks to think about the elections
south of the Border.
Mr Wallace had in front of him on his desk at Edinburgh party
headquarters a message of congratulations from party leader Paddy
Ashdown, who said the SLD in very tough conditions had formed a strong
platform for the May elections.
He said that the results were a powerful tribute to the growing
professionalism and campaigning skills of the party in Scotland, which
was celebrating breaking the ''hundred barrier'' -- more than 120 SLD
councillors were elected.
Mr Wallace said there was now much to play for in the forthcoming
by-election, claiming that with the Conservatives ''out of it'' the
tactical voting argument would disappear. His party would be ''in
contention and challenging.''
He said the SLD now was the largest party grouping in Aberdeenshire
and the Borders and the biggest opposition group on Fife, East
Dunbartonshire, Inverclyde and Aberdeen councils.
''We made more net gains last night than the SNP, increasing our
number of councillors by 25%. Pushing the Tories into fourth place
underlines the extent of our achievement. We have left them in our wake.
In fact it is a wake for them.
''The Scottish Conservatives have experienced a collapse to rival that
of Barings bank. They claim to have fought the elections on local issues
and have been humiliated. We now relish a battle with them on national
issues.''
Mr Wallace said Labour rightly could savour the victory, but the SLD
would be monitoring its performance in the new authorities to see if it
lived up to its claims of a being a '''born-again'' party.
''In particular, we will be judging them on whether they are prepared
to constitute Cosla (the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities) on
the basis of the parties' strengths across Scotland.''
He said it had been a very satisfactory night. ''We have more than hit
our targets and established solid bridgeheads for further advance. I see
no cause for disappointment''.
Mr Wallace said in the last local government reorganisation in the
mid-70s, the party had 17 councillors voted in. This time, they had
achieved that in one council.
''We never made any claims about winning outright control of any
council,'' said Mr Wallace who highlighted the party's winning of
Edinburgh's Cramond ward from the Tories.
''When I heard about Cramond, I thought is there any hope left for the
Conservatives in Scotland?''

THE Scottish local elections began with three days of live BBC
coverage of the Scottish Labour Party conference in Inverness. This was
accompanied by profiles of the interviews with Tony Blair. The
conference was used to launch the Labour campaign and to directly
influence the result.
No Conservative, let alone any other Opposition politician, was
invited to comment or put an alternative view. Since then Mr Blair has
been further reported, while visiting Scotland, again without
alternative political balance.
It goes without saying then that during the course of this local
election the Labour Party has extended and disproportionate media
coverage and it is a dangerous nonsense to suggest that an interview
with the Prime Minister on Panorama, just because it is in the final and
not the first week of the campaign, is in isolation proof of a lack of
balance in political programming.
Talk of a great principle being at stake is a lurid exaggeration.
Certainly had it been the Government seeking to ban the broadcast of any
Opposition party the reaction would have been hysterical and entirely
different.
But such is the nature of Scottish politics that whatever the merits
of the issue the media establishment in Scotland cannot stop to examine
the evidence before supporting any anti-Conservative alliance.
I find it hard to believe that the Scottish media would support or
tolerate any initiative by a Conservative Government to ban an interview
with an Opposition leader.
As a result of this farce News at Ten was unable to broadcast any part
of the interview with the Prime Minister but we were treated instead to
extended comment from Gordon Brown and Paddy Ashdown criticising what
the Prime Minister had said.
No Conservative spokesman was heard redressing this. Meanwhile Alex
Salmond was interviewed in depth on Radio 4's Today programme but not
Ian Lang or George Robertson. Should this, too, have been banned by
Scotland?
Conservative Party spokesmen are well-known for their complaints about
perceptions of BBC balance. These complaints, however, are made to the
BBC and not the courts. This hasty and ill-conceived court action is a
dangerous matter for democracy and the shadow it casts is long.
An attempt has been made successfully to prevent the Scottish people
hearing the Prime Minister participating in an interview which they can
read, in full, in any newspaper unhindered.
The judgment is in my view a wrong one. No editor of a national
newspaper would tolerate a restriction on editorial freedom or allow
integrity to be questioned in this way. Likewise editorial decisions
must remain with the BBC.
To allow the courts of the land to become the arbiters of political
impartiality will serve not the interests of democracy but the pockets
of the legal profession.

AS a former lecturer for Glasgow University Extra-Mural Department, I
would like to endorse Ruth Wishart's comments on the proposal to make
most of these classes ''credit-bearing''.
As far as I was concerned the success of the classes was directly
related to the fact that no assessment was involved. For example, I was
able to give 20 two-hour illustrated lectures on Beethoven, and the same
for Bach, Mozart, and Schubert over an area stretching from
Kirkcudbright to West Kilbride.
Apart from the fact that there would not be many people readily
available to assess such intensively focused courses, what would such
assessment have achieved? Frantic note-taking by students when they
should have been listening, that's what.
A humiliating of those whose writing skills were lousy but whose ears
and hearts were as bright and intelligent as those for whom assessment
would have held no terrors, that's what.
And a wasting of time for many of the class who were long past the age
of assessment, who had jumped through more hoops than their potential
examiners and whose certificates of this and that had been long buried
under the knowledge that comes only of experience.
Worse still, many potential members of those classes would simply
never have enrolled had they thought they were to be assessed, no matter
how gently, and we would have all been the poorer for their absence.
I have to say too that the pleasure would have gone out of it for me
as a lecturer had there been targets to meet, ''standards'' to be
reached by individual students.
I learnt a vast amount myself because of the freedom these lecturing
opportunities gave me, to study where my own interests were
unequivocally engaged, and to have the privilege of teaching classes
which gave me back so much without inhibition.

THE shortest-lived councillor in the new single-tier councils called
yesterday on the election authorities to explain how he had been
returned with a 254 majority, only to be told 40 minutes later that he
had in fact lost by 165 votes.
Mr James McKay, 51, had been contesting Caol, ward 68 in Highland, for
Labour on Thursday night in a straight fight with Independent candidate
Mrs Olwyn Macdonald. With the votes counted, he was asked to go up to
the platform by the returning officer just before 10pm.
Mr McKay, who had been a district councillor for 21 years and a
regional councillor for four, said: ''The returning officer told me I
had won with 682 votes against Mrs Macdonald's 428. This gave me a
majority of 254. People came up to congratulate me and my wife went off
to telephone people.
''Then 20 minutes later, I was told that 39 votes had gone astray. I
wasn't bothered because 39 votes weren't going to make a difference to
my majority.''
However, 20 minutes later the returning officer did a complete
about-turn and announced to a stunned Mr McKay and his supporters that
he had in fact lost the ward.
Mr McKay said: ''He said Mrs Macdonald had polled 657 votes, I had 492
and that Mrs Macdonald was therefore duly elected. How you can go from a
254 majority to losing by 165 escapes me.
''I was promised an investigation but have asked the Labour Party to
look into the matter itself because I have heard nothing.''
Mr McKay said he had been told by Keir Hardie House in Glasgow that it
believed that once a declaration had been made only a court order could
overturn it. ''They are checking it. They have never heard of this
before,'' he said.
''The whole thing was a shambles. I have never seen anything like
this. I was the shortest-lived councillor in the new authorities -- all
of 40 minutes. I haven't slept all night.''
Last night Mr Keith Nichols, Highland region election officer, said an
inquiry was under way. ''I have to interview people and it would not be
proper to make a comment until I get at the truth.''

ISN'T it interesting how business relentlessly goes in cycles? I mean,
the expand, have problems, retreat and restructure, then expand again
type of cycle. And isn't it interesting how simple human motivation
plays such a dominant role in perpetrating these cycles?
I was thinking about this the other day when contemplating the sad end
to Sir Ronnie Miller's brave adventures with Dawson International.
Miller took over 14 years ago from the entrepreneur who built up
Dawson, Sir Alan Smith. He climbed the conventional route from
accountant to finance director, to chief executive, before finally being
entrusted with the top job as chairman and chief exec.
Dawson promptly broke out into a major expansion which at first went
well. After seven years and as many acquisitions the group had more than
half of its business on the other side of the Atlantic. Pre-tax profits
reached a peak of #47m in 1988.
While not an egotistical man, he responded to the attention he
received as a result and, largely unnoticed at the time, began to create
a hugely complex corporate bureaucracy at Dawson's HQ which made the
group sluggish and unresponsive to market forces and other pressures.
Come the fierce US recession of 1990/1991 and it was caught
flat-footed. Despite Miller's increasingly desperate attempts to escape
from the web he had created, it lost a cool #100m in North America.
Shareholder confidence plummeted and, as they say, the rest is history.
As I read the story of Miller's demise, I was reminded of another sad
tale in corporate Scotland, the rapid rise and faster fall of Andros
Stakis, whose buccaneering expansion in the late eighties came within an
ace of destroying his father's creation. With hindsight it was clear
that his overriding motivation, once given the reins of power, was to
prove himself to his father as a strong manager and a clever
businessman.
That is a scenario that we have witnessed before, in the notable form
of Sir Hugh Fraser and his increasingly desperate struggles to prove
himself every bit as much a businessman as his formidable father.
While not driven by anything like the same degree of motivation --
emotions run particularly high in family-owned companies -- it is
tempting to conclude that Sir Ronnie Miller also needed to prove himself
once free of the constraining influence of Sir Alan Smith. Hence his
ambitious US expansion.
Is there, I wonder, a lesson here for the people who have built our
few large successful Scottish companies and who are still in the saddle?
Could it be that their trickiest decision of all comes not in the
vulnerable early days of the venture, when one big mistake means
annihilation, but at the end when there is most at stake? That decision
being, of course, how, when and to whom to hand over their baby.
The inevitable consequence of a change at the top when the founder
retires or succumbs to old age is often a decline in the business's
fortunes and occasionally an outright disaster.
I am not saying that every business built up by a strong individual
will immediately nose dive once someone else takes it over. Some go on
to even greater heights with fresh ideas and energy from a new team. But
any change over brings huge risk.
Look at the contrasting approach to this issue being taken by two of
our most successful entrepreneurs. At the age of 68, Lord MacFarlane is
still firmly in the saddle at his group, albeit as chairman, while his
successor as MD Bill Mackie runs the business on a day-to-day basis. The
former is still in the office at 6am, works ridiculous hours and insists
on leading the deals. As a result he has turned into a virtual art form
the knack of presenting relentlessly rising profits come wind or rain,
come recession or boom.
How that man will be replaced eventually as the leader in his company
and what will happen to its fortunes as a result, I do not know. All I
do know is that it will not be the same.
Although several years younger, Sir Matthew Goodwin, chairman of that
other superbly run Glasgow company Hewden-Stuart, last week announced
his imminent retiral. His successor, Sandy Findlay, another cautious
Scots CA, has been groomed for more than a decade to take over and
continue the same conservative, staunchly independent policies laid down
by Sir Matt. It seems as if he has indeed found a mirror image of
himself.
Perhaps Sir Alan Smith's greatest mistake at Dawson was not to do the
same.

IN Scotland's Homes featuring Arden House, Loch Lomondside, I think
you have mistaken either the date it was built -- which you state as
1868 -- or the architect concerned (March 29).
Sir John James Burnet (1857 to 1938) could not have designed Arden
House in 1868, being then a boy of 11. I suggest that the design date
may possibly have been 1888; or alternatively that his father, John
Burnet (1814 to 1901), who was also an architect, may perhaps have been
involved as the designer.
If indeed it was designed for ''a Lord Provost of Glasgow'' it would
have been more interesting and useful for his name to be given.

MONDAY night's Newsnight (BBC2) was an odd affair, encouraging and
dispiriting in equal measure. It amply demonstrated both what is wrong
with the BBC and all that is very right, but left you thinking hard
about the future of independent public service broadcasting. The jury --
no joke intended -- is still out.
Jeremy Paxman, who these days seems to be daring his employers to try
to shut him up, approached the Panorama row with barely concealed
enthusiasm. As one of the broadcasters fingered by his own
director-general for asking too many hard questions too often, he seemed
intent on delivering an Interviewers' Masterclass. This, or so he seemed
to suggest, is how it's done.
Given that Paxman is one of the BBC's brighter stars, his performance
did the corporation no harm at all; given that Tony Hall, managing
director, news and current affairs, was one of the bones the inquisitor
had between his teeth, Auntie could not help but appear somewhat
pitiful. Personified by Hall, the Beeb looked shifty, implausible, and
ill at ease with itself.
The politicians took their medicine first, however, the Opposition
speakers being pressed, hard but fairly, on the issue of political
censorship through the courts. None seemed much discomfited, and even
Peter Lilley appeared relaxed while affecting outrage. The blond one
actually managed a little joke: the row, he said, ''just goes to show
the Labour Party is very worried about the Prime Minister's appeal''.
Hall was a different kettle of fishy arguments. Variously phrased,
Paxman pressed his boss no fewer than five times to say who -- Downing
Street or Panorama -- chose the transmission date for the Major
interview and failed to secure an answer. The interviewer did his job,
and did it well, yet he more than anyone else on television is perceived
as the sort of journalist of whom John Birt does not approve. What might
that tell us, here in Scotland, of the BBC's ability to ensure that
''nation shall speak unto nation''?
Deadline (C4, Monday) was -- how shall we put this? -- rather
different in style. This bug-on-the-wall look at life within Yorkshire
TV's Calendar news programme did nothing to mock those involved, but
allowed them (and they seemed to need no urging) to do the job
themselves.
After a 16-year-old boy is convicted of murder at Sheffield Crown
Court his family, unsurprisingly, turn nasty with the hacks. A
well-aimed kick almost catches a cameraman in the groin. Back in the
editing suite, this upsetting scene elicits a bit of humour, some
cliches about people in distress, and the excuse to rerun the sequence
over and over again.
At a JobCentre in Pontefract, meanwhile, Michael Portillo is giving
his blessing, without any obvious hint of satire, to something called a
''Jobathon''. The Quiff has his say while a passionate woman heckler who
has been denouncing the whole affair as a fraud goes unheard. ''Piece of
cake,'' says the Calendar reporter afterwards, allowing you to realise
that the minister's handlers were probably saying much the same thing.
For light relief this week there was black comedy, and the welcome
return of George Cole to the screen. Perhaps ITV expected something
light, frothy, and Arfur Daley-like from Bob Larbey's My Good Friend.
Instead, with canned laughter mercifully absent, Cole and Richard
Pearson played a couple of Sunshine Boys for whom the skies have
darkened.
It was superficially gentle, very persuasive, and funny while
eschewing obvious gags. Cole's dour former postman, insisting in the
face of all evidence that he was always jolly at work, is oppressed by
an obsessively house-proud daughter and a dim son-in-law who love him
dearly, sort of, but just wish he would stay in his room, not least when
visitors are expected.
Here the children were becoming their parents, but the parent was
refusing to be turned into a child. Cole's daughter was prodding him
towards a ''wonderful club'' for older people. What do they do, he
wanted to know, that's so wonderful? ''Compare varicose veins, swap
false teeth? They probably exchange the telephone numbers of cheap heart
surgeons.''
Already the characters of Cole and Pearson seem perfectly matched.
The latter says mournfully that he has been told to leave a school.
That's not unreasonable, Cole points out, at your age. But the old man
had merely been entranced by a playground rippling with ''the sheer joy
of being young''. Yes, says Cole, ''depressing, isn't it?''
My Good Friend deserves all the encouragement it can get, if only
because its production shows a rare willingness on the part of ITV to
attempt a sit-com that isn't dumb, obvious, and loud. This is
underplayed all the way. Thus, when the two old men meet for the first
time: ''Have a brandy?'' 'It's a bit early, isn't it?'' ''You might be
dead this afternoon.''
Jean Renoir has been dead for 16 years, as anyone who has been near a
picture house and seen what has passed for cinema in his absence will
know. The man of whom Darryl Zanuck, saying more than he knew, once
remarked, ''Renoir has a lot of talent, but he's not one of us'', earned
his own Omnibus biography (BBC1, Tuesday) and delighted, effortlessly,
with the words and pictures from beyond the grave.
In the first of two parts, the old man recalled his childhood:
''Montmartre in those days was the garden of Eden.'' He talked of his
father, the painter Auguste, whose colours grew brighter as his eyes
dimmed. We saw the patriarch luminous in grainy black-and-white film, as
though through a grimy window on a sunny day, struggling to the last to
paint with hands shaped like talons by arthritis.
Omnibus produced an orthodox, simple piece that somehow managed to be
infused with idea of art rather than its practice. It is a platitude to
say the subject was allowed to talk for himself. If you have the words
of Jean Renoir, maker of two, if not three, of the greatest films on the
planet, what would you dare to add? In a better-than-average week the
BBC also found time for La Grande Illusion. Somehow that alone put
Panorama firmly in its place.

Word of her skills got out into the community. Neighbours started
beating a path to her door
Alison Keith began by offering sewing classes to neighbours in her
Ayrshire village. But as Alex Stephen discovered, news of her abilities
soon spread and she now exports her handicrafts to London and New York
IF you want to know how to build a thriving business on a lack of
skills, word of mouth advertising and selling on a personal
recommendation alone, then Alison Keith is the person to ask. The lack
of skills is, needless to say, not hers. The need for the Alison Keith
Craft School, which she runs in her modernised 1764 farm house, Laigh
Auchengree in Glengarnock, Ayrshire, lies in a hiccup which occurred
between 1939 and 1945 in the process of passing craft skills from
generation to generation.
She was one of a minority of children who were taught these skills at
a point during the war when mothers had other things on their minds, and
the many who worked had little enough time to spend with their
offspring.
From the age of three, Glasgow-born Keith was initiated by her
grandmother (who, she maintains, was a typically talented Scots woman of
her generation) into the skills of embroidery, crochet, knitting,
sewing, dressmaking, ribbon weaving, stencilling for home decoration,
and the making of quilted cushions, etuis (sewing kits), jam, chutney,
pickles, and the blackcurrant and ginger wines which were produced for
consumption at New Year.
When she and her husband moved to Glengarnock about six years ago,
word of her skills got out into the community. Neighbours started
beating a path to her door, seeking information about how to do this or
make that. At the same time she was expressing regret to her friends
that many parents were not in a position to pass traditional skills on
to their children. She was challenged to teach a craft class to fill the
gap.
Keith had for some time been thinking of starting a small business and
it occurred to her that a class might form the basis of a viable
concern. She sought the help of the Garnock Valley Development
Executive, who launched her on their New Business Incentive Scheme, and
the Alison Keith Craft School was born.
The rural grapevine carried the message and she was so inundated with
enquiries and requests for information that it became obvious she would
have to hold several open days in her home. These acquainted interested
neighbours with the types of craft that could be offered and the
techniques which would be employed.
Fortunately, Keith's hope that interest in craft skills would be
sustained has been justified and the classes have developed into a
series. She tries to be as flexible as she can with arrangements -- some
last for a single day and others for a couple of hours per week spread
over five weeks.
Flexibility is encouraged within classes too. If a student attending,
say, a quilting group spots the stencilling materials and fancies trying
them Keith will accommodate the new interest. The classes have a maximum
of 10 students and are invariably over-subscribed.
They are by all accounts happy affairs full of laughter and gossip,
the students enjoying them so much that they often run beyond the time
allocation.
There has been an important carry over for one student of quilting who
is now considering starting her own business in this craft -- an
enterprise which Keith welcomes.
She cannot praise too highly the Development Executive's help which
is, as she says, at the end of a telephone line. The professional advice
she received and, of course, the #40 per week she was paid were
essential in getting her embryo business off the ground.
Although it was not her original intention, almost immediately on
starting her business she extended her activities to craft
manufacturing. Concentrating principally on quilts, quilted cushions and
etuis, she has been pleasantly surprised by how popular they have
become.
She has been able to sell all she makes by personal recommendation and
approaches. As a result etuis have been sent to London, Ireland and
recently to Fifth Avenue, New York, and cot quilts have gone to Holland
and ''all over the place''.
When John Logan of the Garnock Valley Development Executive phoned her
with an invitation to share the Ayrshire Enterprise stand at the recent
Made in Scotland craft trade fair at the SECC in Glasgow, her reaction
was: ''Don't be silly. What foreign buyer would want to buy the things I
make?''
It is a response which might be expected from a woman who is adamant
that when she buys, for example, a holiday souvenir it should be made in
the country she is visiting. But not everyone shares her point of view,
and crafts, she has discovered, can be readily sold across national
boundaries.
Each of the 10 Ayrshire craft workers who shared the stand gained from
the exposure, and she was pleased with the enthusiastic response of
foreign buyers to her own wares in her first shop window.
Already the benefits are appearing. She has been invited to place her
crafts in shops situated from Inverness to the Borders, and arrangements
have been made for them to appear in two catalogues, one, the Clan
Catalogue produced by Perfectly Scottish for the American market, and
the other a Gaelic language publication put together by the Fionan
project. She has also been invited to give a demonstration of quilting
at the Heritage Centre in Tarbert, Argyll.
She expects the demand for her work generated by the craft fair to
continue over the next six months to a year. The interest already
apparent has made her think of taking on a local person to help. A
prospect which pleases her enormously, for she feels strongly that if
you live in a community you should contribute to it, and this would be a
positive contribution to hers.

THE HERALD asks me for a profile of the Scottish Tories, and to
explain how they came to where they are today. Therefore the profile
begins with a prelude.
It is set in Green's Playhouse (for the St Andrew's Hall is too small)
in the 1950s. The aged Churchill has rumbled through denunciations of
socialism at home and turned eagerly to the world scene. When the
applause subsides he responds with his party piece, a neglected verse
from Rule Britannia. The odd word may be wrong; but every pause and
cadence is etched in my memory:
The nations not so blest as thee
Must in their turn to tyrants fall;
But thou shalt flourish, brave and free,
The dread, and envy, of them all.
This is the party of imperial inheritance, still calling itself
Unionist. It is also the coalition against socialism, and many of those
who cheer Churchill have, like him, once called themselves Liberals.
At the election afterwards the Titan has reluctantly retired and Eden
is flitting through Downing Street. In Scotland the Tories have 50.1% of
the vote and 36 seats out of 71. Even in Glasgow there are seven Tory
MPs.
Four years later most of Britain agreed it had never had it so good,
but the West of Scotland dissented as the shipyards began to feel the
chill east wind. The Conservative decline which began in Scotland has
occasionally been checked, but never decisively reversed. The diminished
hard core of paid-up members has grown used to thinking ''Things can't
get worse'' and then discovered that they have.
Since I began with that glimpse of one great personality, I pick
others to illustrate stages of decline. Politics is not mainly about
personal heroics or postures, but analysis of individual contributions
reveals trends and turning-points. Consider then the Scottish Tory
fortunes in relation to four men (though one Iron Lady will be
mentioned): Harold Macmillan, Edward Heath, Iain Macleod, and Jo
Grimond.
Grimond, the obvious odd man out, has always been under-rated because
he never held office or even the balance of power. But he saved the
Liberal Party when it might have been squeezed out, perhaps ought to
have faded away. In Scotland he reversed the process in which
Conservatism broadened its base by absorbing the remnants of Liberalism.
Despite his apparent failure, he called one Conservative bluff. He
revived the Liberal Party just sufficiently to show that division of the
anti-socialist vote did not (at least after 1955) inevitably mean a
Labour Government. The revival was also sufficient to reveal a truth
especially awkward for Scottish Tories: that some of the most profoundly
conservative attitudes, areas, and influences in the country remain
detached from political Conservatism, and even hostile to it.
Some (as a delightful recent little book by Ben Coutts has shown) find
a happy home in the Liberal Party. Others lurk behind the semi-socialist
facade of the modern SNP or co-exist in the Labour Party, more evident
at grass-roots than conferences.
Grimond never broke through but achieved important, limited
objectives. Harold Macmillan, the Arran crofter's grandson, for a time
seemed master of all he surveyed but left little behind. Far from being
''unflappable'', he was a trimmer and twitcher, with some generous
emotions (especially linked to memories of war and Depression) and
others which distorted his judgment, as when he rushed the party into
miscasting Sir Alec Douglas-Home as its leader.
Alec Douglas-Home, embodiment of everything best in traditional
Toryism, was roughly handled for admitting his limitations about
economics. Macmillan admitted few limitations and tried to apply in the
1960s what he had vainly advocated in the utterly different situation of
the 1930s.
The main result was a degree of Government intervention in the economy
which created false hopes in Scotland, most obviously at Linwood and
Bathgate. A secondary but important consequence was to discourage new
Tory thinking or bold action in areas where official and ''expert''
consensus opinions, even under Conservative rule, tended to express
socialist opinions about council-housing, comprehensive education, and
accepting the trade unions as estates of the realm.
In Scotland, Tory social and economic policies in the pre-Thatcher era
did little to create a social climate in which political Conservatism
could thrive. The wealth and welfare of the nation were seen as
depending on the State, not on a necessary dominance of the private
sector.
The mood which emerged helps explain not only difficulties of Scottish
Conservatism but the palpable reluctance with which large sections of
the Scottish Labour movement now accept Mr Blair's hormone injections.
Edward Heath, so much less spectacular or flamboyant in presence than
Macmillan, was his natural heir, even though the brief Douglas-Home
interlude came between them. Heath had the supreme political misfortune
not to be allowed time to recover from his mistakes: among them the
Macmillan-style twitching and trimming over shipbuilding. But the
mistake that mattered most in Scotland and still restricts the freedom
of action of Scottish Conservatism was the mixture of haste and
hesitation with which he reacted to new and vitally important factors in
Scottish politics: the questions about Scottish identity and the bold,
brash answer offered by the SNP. It was Mr Heath, even more than the
lady who displaced him, who ensured that Scottish Tories are today boxed
into a difficult situation over devolution.
They are -- and must be -- a Unionist party. Everything Conservatism
believes about political evolution, guarding inheritance or building on
tradition, and the threat to society from the politics of rancour,
obliges it to resist the break-up of the United Kingdom. The social
composition and economic involvement of the people making up the party,
supporters as well as leaders, also ensures it reflects the proper
concern of vast numbers of Scots for whom the United Kingdom is the
natural expression of social and family ties, as well as economic
interests.
The difficulty, ever since Heath rushed into the devolutionary
''Declaration of Perth'' in 1968 and then retreated, is that there has
been neither inclination nor opportunity to develop the idea that a
limited form of legislative, as well as administrative devolution, with
no threat of increased taxes or Government economic intervention, could
help sustain the Union and improve its government. Instead, the
devolution on offer, in Blair's form as well as Callaghan's obsolete
model, is a halfway house to nationalism, and a house built on sand.
The Declaration of Perth was not a turning point, though originally
and prematurely meant to provide one. The turning point came when Mr
Heath later seemed to exclude the possibility which he himself opened
up: that Conservatives would decide constitutional reform was too
important and dangerous to be left to anyone else. The result is that we
are now threatened with it, in a perilous form, as soon as anyone else
-- alone or in Lib-Lab pact -- has a majority.
But I have kept to the end the saddest and most influential Tory
turning-point: the death of Iain Macleod in 1970. That warm and eloquent
expatriate Gael was also the lost leader, the influence that might have
been. His early death is also the key to understanding the Thatcher
phenomenon, and all it involved, in styles of leadership and government.
These grated on Scottish feelings and made it increasingly difficult for
the Conservative Party to sustain a revival in Scotland, despite
occasional scores against the run of play and skilful handling of the
Scottish Office.
The Tories turned to Margaret Thatcher because Macleod was dead and
Keith Joseph had blown his chances by exchanging economics for eugenics.
With a lady ''not for turning'', there was no turning back. The party
was guided by Margaret Thatcher's rhetoric, driven by great powers of
will and mind, and not by the other ''conviction politician'' Iain
Macleod, who had those same powers, added to an even sharper mind, a
greater readiness to listen, and a more evident sensitivity. Had Macleod
lived he would have been Prime Minister, and would have pursued most of
the policies now styled ''Thatcherite'', but in a different mood.
But Margaret Thatcher's achievement, as well as her abrasive style,
created Tory problems more acute in Scotland than elsewhere. She won
three elections and left John Major a party strong and coherent enough
to win a fourth. Even the natural party of government never expected to
be in power so long. The inevitable result is that Conservatism in
Scotland -- a minority both in parliamentary and popular support -- is
also the natural target of all those who find themselves ''agin the
Government'', often for reasons much more practical or self-interested
than ideological. For example, I constantly see, even in the best
regulated newspapers, headings which succinctly and quite misleadingly
ascribe to ''the Tories'' government decisions of an administrative
rather than party-political character.
But these conditions are the price of office. Those who wish to extend
their term have to live with them and fight their way past them, rather
than waste time in lamentations. The same is true of what appears to
Conservatives as an overwhelming bias against them in the Scottish
media, even when taken to extraordinary lengths in the Daily Record, and
carrying as much conviction as a remaindered biography of Robert
Maxwell.
Some forms of fashionable Tory-bashing are probably
counter-productive. For example, Gordon Brown, who came out of such a
kindly manse, has programmed himself always to contrast ''ordinary
people'' with the Tories as ''the privileged few''. But in any political
party of substance, and especially a Conservative one, the ordinary
people will always outnumber both the high-flyers and the zealots. What
matters is that the minority who take out formal membership provide a
vital link between the national or local politicians and the habitual or
potential supporters.
In these terms, grass-roots Scottish Conservatism is neither as
significant as it was a generation ago nor as debilitated as it
sometimes seems. I offer two contrasting assessments of its condition.
The truth is not so much somewhere between them as in both of them.
Here is a party whose base has narrowed. In 40 years it has declined
from being the party of most of the Scottish middle-class and
substantial segments of the working-classes, to being the natural home
and last resort of the fairly prosperous or ultra-cautious. It has lost
most of its support in areas which still think ''working-class'' a
meaningful term. This is sometimes attributed to a decline of sectarian
feelings, though their importance in national party politics was always
exaggerated. I think it much more the result of changing social
patterns, with a vastly expanding but ill-defined middle class and
blighted areas with little of the pride in community and individuality
which political Conservatism needs.
But here also is a party forcing opponents to change their tune.
Labour has to appeal to the house-owners it penalised, to watch its own
councillors buy their council houses, to abandon nationalisation, even
tacitly to accept the privatisation of the Thatcher years. And if I
understand Gordon Brown's message to ''ordinary people'', it is that
taxes are too high and Labour, presumably, will drastically cut them.
Scots Conservatives may not have set the pace in forcing these welcome
changes in political assumptions, but they bore the heat and burden of
many a bitter day while change became possible. They were also the party
in Scotland which more clearly and consistently saw the way through, and
past, the Cold War.
Indeed, in all respects but one, the Tories can claim to be the party
in Scotland most in tune with trends of the times throughout the world.
The imperfections and incentives of capitalism are more acceptable than
illusions of socialism. Free markets need governments with a sense of
social responsibility and sustainable welfare provision; but individual
freedom is unattained without recognition of private property.
The trend which Scots Tories must defy is strident reassertion of old
nationalisms in a new age. The collapse of totalitarianism and
liberation of nations forcibly suppressed should not be followed by the
disruption of old-established and tolerably harmonious political and
economic communities. Scottish symptoms of the nationalist fever are, by
international standards, comparatively mild, but we still need to gang
warily.
Tories got out of the way of calling themselves Unionist. But if
''Unionist'', like the original labels of Tory and Whig, is to be hurled
as a term of abuse, we should accept it proudly. Whatever the
limitations on our political flexibility, whatever our other
difficulties, there are worse fates than to fight as the Union party.

RUGBY commentators Ian Robertson and Bill McLaren were on parade in
Glasgow yesterday entertaining the guests at a sporting lunch in the
city's Hospitality Inn.
Perhaps, coming the day after the local government elections, it was
not surprising that there was just a touch of political humour in the
air, although it has to be said most of the jokes were at the expense of
the English.
However, when Robertson of the BBC asked the audience of several
hundred business people if there were any Tories present only one hand
went up . . . that of Gavin Laird, general secretary of the Amalgamated
Engineering and Electrical Union, who was sitting at the top table.
He had a smile on his face as he raised his hand, though, and everyone
knew he was only joking.
Willie Munro, chief executive of the Scottish Building Society, who
had a number of guests at the lunch, also claimed that his secretary was
only joking when she described him in rugby parlance as right wing
(very) in the invitations.
Ready to ring
the changes?
A WEEK to go and its phoneday, or for the almost one in four companies
who have not yet carried out the necessary alterations to their systems,
it could turn out to be no phone day.
From April 16 -- next Sunday -- all area codes except for five English
cities will begin with 01, and if your equipment has not been modified
you could find yourself unable to make calls.
If you are one of the minority who have not yet acted and want more
information you can call BT's free phoneday helpline on 0800 010101.
Brokers prepare
to take stock
HERE'S an opportunity for members of Scotland's stockbroking
fraternity to show how clever they are. They can enter the Investor
Challenge '95 sponsored by the London International Futures and
Financial Options Exchange.
Competitors are asked to invest a notional #100,000 in shares, gilts
and options for a 10-week period commencing on April 24. The competition
is open to individuals, but stockbroking firms can enter a team if they
want.
Just imagine, if you win you can tell all your clients how clever you
are and how much money you could have made them if you had been
investing their cash. However, I suppose there is a snag, one of your
customers might also enter . . . and beat you.
Anyone willing to put their reputation on the line can call LIFFE's
help desk on 0171 628 8282. There is an entry fee of #40 and a prize of
#5000 for the winner.
Strathkelvin
offers grants
STRATHKELVIN Enterprise Trust chief executive Andrew Thomson believes
that the business community should stand tall, and to make his point he
launched the trust's new marketing campaign, entitled Setting the Wheels
in Motion, with the help of an eight-foot cardboard cut out of a
businessman on a trike.
Thomson is concerned that, despite the trust's success in providing 95
new business last year with grant-aided assistance, many existing firms
have the misconception that the Enterprise Trust only exists to help new
businesses.
He told Business Diary: ''We are here for all businesses new and old.
Therefore, with a radical and rather creative advertising campaign, we
hope that we will get the correct message across.''
Firms in the Kirkintilloch area such as McGavigans and Harper Collins
came to the campaign launch along with MP Sam Galbraith.
In recent months the trust has spent a great deal of time and energy
assisting small firms in the area who were badly affected by the
flooding.
Tartan is right
royal success
BROTHERS Graham and Lindsay Crawford believe their Balmoral tartan
range is going places now that it is decorating a palace -- not Balmoral
but Kensington.
The royal order arrived for the Glasgow furnishing and fabric supplier
following a phone call from Buckingham Palace.
The firm sent a pattern book, which includes the eight most popular
tartans, and the royal household chose the MacNaughton fabric to recover
some furniture in Kensington Palace.
The brothers are certainly not slow off the mark. A senior member of
staff at the Marine Highland Hotel at Troon, where their Balmoral range
is being used to redecorate the bedrooms, mentioned that Sean Connery
had commented favourably on the designs. Quick as a flash the pair sent
off a pattern book to the star's agent in Bel Air, Los Angeles.
Graham Crawford told Business Diary: ''Our fabrics are made of cotton
and will react better to a hot climate than the wool which is commonly
used.''
Halifax adopts
gold standard
THE merger between the Halifax and Leeds Permanent building societies
is on course, and most people accept the reality is that, as the merged
body will be known as the Halifax, what is happening is more like a
takeover than a merger.
However, the giant Halifax is obviously willing to learn a thing or
two from its smaller partner, as following the merger it is going to
rename its investment accounts giving them the gold tag which is the
style of the Leeds gold accounts.
But a Halifax spokesman assured us that it will only be a name change
-- investors should not expect anything xtra in their accounts.
The name change will be from August 1 if the merger is given the
go-ahead.
Fancy taking a
trip to China?
LORD Weir is to lead a Scottish trade mission to China from September
3 to 8. It will visit Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, and is likely to
be accompanied by a senior Government minister.
The mission is being organised by the China-Britain Trade Group, Giles
Blackburn in the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce is helping with the
arrangements, and Scottish Financial Enterprise is hoping that some of
its members will join in.
Sainsbury's
lunch date
NEXT month's meeting of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce in the Central
Hotel should attract a fair turnout as David Sainsbury, chairman and
chief executive of the Sainsbury supermarket group, has agreed to travel
north to address members.
Following his talk there will be a buffet lunch. If you are interested
in going along you should contact the marketing department at the
chamber.
According to Sainsbury head office, its chief executive has no other
appointments in Glasgow that day, but if I was the manager of the stores
in Darnley or East Kilbride, I would be circling May 22 and making sure
I didn't take that day off just in case.
Dining club
provides dough
I DON'T want those people who know me to laugh, but this week I was
invited to join the Discerning Dining Club at Glasgow College of Food
Technology on Tuesday, April 25.
I turned down the invitation not merely because the menu was not to my
taste -- it offered roasted loin of wild boar garnished with crispy sage
noodles and calvados jus stuffed tomatoes -- but also because I will be
out of the country at this time.
However, I was intrigued to discover what the Discerning Dining Club
was all about and enquired of Jennifer Bryson what was behind the idea.
She informed me that the College of Food Technology, like most of our
other further education establishments, had to look for ways to raise
extra cash, or in this case perhaps it should be dough.
One result is the club, with between 30 and 40 guests paying
#30-a-head to dine in the college's own restaurant. Not only do diners
get to enjoy a delightful meal, but one of the college's chefs explains
how he cooks the various courses and the ingredients he uses.

LEADING Scottish academic Professor Joseph Lamb is to criticise
British Gas over the company's controversial handling of executive pay
at the company's forthcoming annual meeting.
Professor Lamb, who is Professor Emeritus of Physiology at St Andrews
University, has put down a special resolution critical of the company
which will be voted on by shareholders at the meeting on May 31.
''The company has been seen to have disadvantaged its consumers,
workers and private shareholders by its failure to communicate
effectively with them separately and as a whole,'' Professor Lamb
declares in a statement supporting his resolution.
This calls on the British Gas board to form an advisory group to
interview the chief executive and chairman three times a year and
prepare a report for discussion at the annual meeting.
British Gas chairman Richard Giordano admits in his annual statement,
published yesterday, that the group could have handled the question of
directors' pay better. He is still likely to face critical questioning
from disaffected shareholders at the annual meeting.
The group has attracted fierce criticism for the big salary increase
and lucrative share options of its chief executive, Cedric Brown, and
for the way the information was released.
''The manner in which these changes were disclosed created confusion,
since the disclosures were not accompanied by a full and adequate
explanation. For this we can only blame ourselves,'' proclaims Mr
Giordano in his report
Professor Lamb considers his proposed advisory group should consist of
four private shareholders and two members each from the Gas Consumers'
Council and recognised trade unions. He points out that recent changes
in the restructuring of British Gas have led to a considerable amount of
adverse publicity.
British Gas has now gone out its way to give a full disclosure of
executive pay and share options in the hope this will deflect criticism.
The annual report contains five pages of small print explaining the
policy.
''The best remedy for some of these issues is more disclosure and this
report I would think has more disclosure in it than any other report
published this year,'' Mr Giordano said on BBC radio.
The small print reveals that Mr Brown could be entitled to payouts
topping #1m. His basic pay was raised by 75% to #475,000 last November,
at a time when salary cuts were being imposed on certain staff and plans
were being laid to axe a third of the workforce. His share options are
currently showing a paper gain of #300,000 and he could receive a
further #594,000 under a long-term incentive scheme.
The salary jump provoked a public outcry and Mr Brown was called twice
to appear before the Employment Select Committee to explain his
remuneration.
The report also discloses that finance director Roy Gardner received a
''golden hello'' of #100,000 when he joined the group from GEC last year
and will receive a further #100,000 this month. Mr Giordano -- for a
time in a previous job Britain's highest-paid director -- received
#450,000 plus other benefits of #21,818. He is expected to devote 75% of
his time to the company.  A second dissident shareholder has put forward
a resolution critical of the company for the annual meeting to consider.
Pensions and Investment Research Consultants (PIRC) calls for British
Gas to achieve best practice on executive pay. PIRC represents
institutional shareholders having about 3% of the group.
''They (the directors) have undermined morale in the workforce, upset
their customers and the public and have given themselves pay rises not
justified by performance,'' declared Anne Simpson, managing director of
PIRC.
The body points out that although British Gas cites international oil
companies for comparative purposes when deciding executive pay it
derives only a small part of its turnover from overseas. It also says it
would be expensive for institutions if all companies sought to raise
salaries to the median level, as British Gas has done.

YOU soon know who your friends are when you give them a call to get
you out of jail. The Imperial Cancer Research Fund was lucky because it
obviously choose a popular bunch to imprison in its recent Jail 'n' Bail
fundraising event.
The charity arrested 13 business executives from their offices and
took them to the Golden Lion Hotel in Stirling, where they were
incarcerated for two hours during which time they were given mobile
phones and told to get bail pledges from friends and colleagues to
secure their release.
Elaine McCleary, the fund's Scottish appeals manager, was hoping to
raise #6000, but in fact the ''prisoners'' got #8339.51 between them.
Top of the popularity stakes was John Cook of Patons &amp; Baldwin who made
#1357 bail money, followed by Robert Graham of Grahams Dairies whose
benefactors chipped in #1354.40.
A colleague of John Cook, a production shift manager, told Business
Diary: ''We were going to double it if they kept him.''

You're most likely to smell of whatever turns you on, as Anvar Khan
discovers at a new exhibition with extra sensory perception
AT THE Hunterian Museum in Glasgow University, two members of The
Aroma Foundation, Karen Storch, an aromatherapist, and George Dodd, a
leader in smell research, are chairing a lecture-cum-debate on the
importance of scent. They kick off by issuing strips of paper whose tips
have been saturated with a particular smell. Members of the audience
have to guess what it is.
Answers vary. The general consensus is that it's a male aftershave.
George and Karen stress that smell is based on association, and
different individuals will smell different things. ''It smells like baby
lotion,'' confirms a 17-year-old girl.
George and Karen nod sagely to each other, and proclaim the girl's
comment ''very interesting''. At the end of the experiment we're told
that the aftershave or baby lotion is the first scent human beings ever
smell, that of their mother, while they are in the womb.
Heavenly Scent is a perfume exhibition presently pervading the
chambers of the Royal College of Art in London. It aims to expose the
peccadillos of people who collect perfume bottles; the craftsmanship of
creating scent; the manufacturing process (citrus extraction, steam
distillation) and perfume's place in global culture. The exhibition
comes to the Hunterian Museum on May 13.
But to decipher the powers of scent and smell is to inhabit the darker
realms. George Dodd looks like a university lecturer, baggy of cord
trouser, crumpled of jumper, bearded and generally concerned. But he is
a subversive.
''Sex is the product of smell and touch,'' he theorises. ''We all live
in a Christian, if not post-Christian society. And traditionally
sexuality is a great sin.''
In the seventeenth century, the practice of herbalism, or the science
of using scent to combat epidemics, was enough evidence in itself to
support the idea that a British woman was in collusion with the devil,
and frequently resulted in her cremation as a witch. Nowadays, the art
of aromatherapy is common. Women are no longer in fear of their lives if
they want to practise alternative healing.
Whenever a civilisation wants to rediscover its roots, its base note,
it refers to the more savage elements. The study of Eastern or African
cultures results in a catalogue of therapies based on the trial and
error of previous, investigative generations. Communication between
races has opened sleeping libraries of information.
Dodd tells us of his journey to visit the Dogon people. There are a
quarter of a million of them. They used to live further north in Nigeria
until, in the sixteenth century, they were persecuted by Muslims. They
currently live in villages on a cliff face in Mali, below the Sahara.
The cliff is 100 feet high and 100 miles long. George tells me that the
Dogons bury their ancestors in caves above their roofs. You can see the
bones sticking out.
They are a happy people, he says. Each village has a man's house,
where the men congregate to do nothing. The women transport the precious
commodity of water on their heads, like ants. The Dogons also grow
onions on a colossal scale, which George can't understand, because it is
the vegetable which demands the most water to grow.
The problem is that the Dogons are surrounded by exotic, spicy plants
and flowers which give off colourful, sweet scent, and they do not make
any use of them, either as a perfume or medicine. George doesn't know
what their seeming ignorance of smell proves. Does it mean that man
learned to smell and exploit scent? That it was never innate? And what
do we do? he torments; do we leave them there? This is the white man's
burden. Do you educate a savage people, who have their own culture, and
ask them to take on another?
George, thankfully, has aromatherapy to aid restful sleep. The Dogons
represent the whole battle. To exploit them would be to exploit the very
human roots he respects. That is, the wisdom of instinctive, not
educated man.
George Dodd knows a great deal about smell. Everybody smells, he says
-- literally. Racial body odour has no deodorant. The Japanese
collectively smell of fish and the British of butter. Yes, it is
disgusting but true. Each nation has a particular scent and it is
determined by the mainstay of their diet. If you don't like the smell of
something you don't eat it.
Indeed, the biggest problem distributors of the world's surplus foods
encounter when donating stuffs to the Third World, is the complete
suspicion of the natives, whose olfactory warning bells sound when asked
to eat foreign, alien substances which bear no relation to their own
diet.
Smell is a great ally as well as a deterrent. But it has its
casualties. George says that the human sense of smell deteriorates with
age, and that pensioners often complain that food tastes bland. He
insists that food for older people should be reformulated as it is for
babies.
But it is in medicine, too, that smell can be used positively. Four
million people in Britain, mostly middle-aged women, are hooked on
sleeping tablets. Traditional medicine has always decreed that large
doses of drugs be used to hit one small chemical centre of the brain.
The amount is governed by the voyage the drug has to make round the
body, courtesy of the bloodstream, before it hits the target area.
But there are more than 1,000 receptors in the brain soaking up smell.
It is a direct route to the chemical centre of the brain. Smelling drugs
would also avoid side-effects. It is a serious suggestion. In Oxford,
hospitals no longer prescribe tranquillisers for patients suffering from
insomnia but burn lavender in the wards instead.
* World Smell Day will take place on June 16. The Aroma Foundation can
be contacted on Tel/Fax: 01445 731596.

THE dollar plunged to fresh lows overnight in Tokyo and fell below 84
yen for the first time in history. The dollar has lost 3.5% of its value
against the Japanese currency this week and 17% so far this year.
It is also chronically weak against the German mark and the hard
Continental currencies.
On the face of it there is no end in sight to the dollar's decline
against these currencies, though at some stage the yen and the mark will
overshoot and the dollar will bounceback, temporarily, from what seem
absurdly low levels.
Earlier this week NatWest Markets' economics team in Washington put a
different perspective on the crisis. ''There is an old saying that if
you owe your banker $1000 you will not be able to sleep at night, but if
you owe him a million, then it is the banker who will lose sleep,''
quipped US economist Doug Lee.
''Something similar is happening in the foreign exchange markets. The
Federal Reserve is resting easy as the dollar falls, but the German and
Japanese central banks have been forced into action.''
To keep their economies on the recovery track the Germans and Japanese
have been forced to reduce interest rates. Last week the Bundesbank cut
its key discount rate by half-a-point and in Japan short-term money
market rates have fallen sharply from very low levels.
So far the Bank of Japan has resisted calls for it to cut its official
discount rate by up to 0.75%, but it may be close to conceding the
point.
Exporters in the hard currency countries are squealing at the damage
being done to their businesses. The situation is similar to the one in
the UK in the early eighties when sterling's status as a petro-currency
crippled manufacturing industry.
Germany has stepped up pressure on the US authorities to do something
about the basic problem, widely perceived to be America's excessive
budget deficit.
German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt spelt it out bluntly. ''Our
interest rates are not the problem. In Germany we have an appropriate
level of interest rates. The problem is the Americans and their budget
policy. The US must give signals for a convincing policy of stability
and a reduction in state debt. Then the dollar will pick up again.''
Bundebank vice-president Johann Wilhelm Gaddum was more diplomatic,
but the message was the same. ''The loss in the value of the dollar and
the weakness of several European currencies are linked to the fact that
markets are losing confidence in the ability of those with political
responsibility to solve their budget problems.
''The reasons for this weakness can -- if I disregard certain
speculative exaggerations -- only be removed by the affected
countries.''
The French Economy Minister, Edmond Alphandery, was on a different
track. He called on France's G-7 partners, who meet in Washington later
this month, to examine ways of stabilising exchange rates along the
lines of the Louvre and Plaza accords a decade ago.
His plea is unlikely to find much support among the other G-7 nations,
but even if it did the central banks of the world's leading economic
powers no longer have the muscle to control the direction of foreign
exchange markets. Recent interventions have done nothing to halt the
dollar's decline.
There is little doubt that the twin US deficits are the root cause of
the dollar's persistent weakness. The budget deficit is too high and
personal savings too low. As a result the US is dependent on foreign
inflows to finance its budget deficit.
The current account deficit is nearly 2% of gross domestic product and
foreign debts exceed $500bn. If real interest rates do not rise then the
dollar must fall to make US assets look cheap to foreigners.
The situation is complicated by the fact that the dollar is overvalued
against its North American Free Trade Area partners, Mexico and Canada.
Following the devaluation of the peso American exports to Mexico are
plunging. The US trade deficit with Mexico is heading for $15bn to $20bn
annually with little chance that the exports will be sent elsewhere.
Hence the Federal Reserve's policy of benign neglect with regard to
the dollar. City economists at James Capel fear the dollar could be in
terminal decline and are forecasting falls to 70 yen and DM1.20
(currently around DM1.38) over the next five years.
There is little comfort in this for the UK. Sterling is caught in the
middle of the crossfire between the dollar and the hard currencies. In
trade-weighted terms its international value is gradually retreating.
The Government's political failings are not helping.
Yesterday it dropped from 84.5 to 84.3 in the face of the
Conservatives' worst-ever showing in the Scottish local elections.
Financial markets had largely discounted the debacle, but there are
fears of further falls next month after the local elections in England
and Wales.

* I have 2850 convertible cumulative Preference shares in Rank
Organisation. I have been told I have the right to convert these into
fully paid Ordinary shares. Similar conversion rights will arrive in
each of the years 1996 to 2003. Should I convert or wait? Rank seems to
be doing fairly well at the moment.
* The conversion terms are #13.30 nominal of Ordinary shares for every
#100 nominal of stock. That means 53.2 Ordinary shares for every 500
convertible Preference. So on conversion you would have 303 Ordinary
shares currently worth #1210.
Your convertible Preference shares have a value of #3847 so it clearly
will not be worth converting for a long time yet, if ever. High yielding
convertible stocks perform more like fixed-interest stocks for much of
their lives, and the main influence on them is the trend in interest
rates.
Only as the final conversion date approaches may the performance of
the Ordinary shares have a bearing, depending on the conversion terms.
Otherwise Rank has the option of redeeming the stock at any time from
May 2003 until July 2007 when it must be redeemed.
The Preference shares should clearly be considered as an income
holding. If you are more interested in capital gain you should sell them
and buy the Ordinary. You are correct in thinking Rank has sound
prospects given the likely increasing consumer spending on leisure in
the years ahead.
* I have acquired two shareholdings by way of an unexpected legacy and
both give rise to queries. My 2960 Hanson shares will, I believe,
eventually entitle me to 296 shares in the newly hived-off US Industries
without any outlay on my part. Are the dividends from this new holding
likely to be balanced by a corresponding fall in Hanson dividends?
The 3773 BTR shares are accompanied by 410 warrants with dates in 1995
and 1996, 1997 and 1998. The paperwork does not make it clear what these
warrants entitle me to nor what, if anything, I have to do at the
relevant dates.
* Hanson has pledged to maintain its cash dividend and continue its
progressive payout policy after the demerger.
Each warrant entitles you to subscribe for a BTR share at the exercise
price during a 30-day period following the annual meeting, which is
normally held towards the end of May. For the 1995, 1996 and 1997
warrants the exercise price is 258p and for the 1998 it is 405p. So the
first exercise period will be this June.
The warrants are all quoted on the stock market and offer a highly
geared way into BTR shares. For example, the 1995 and 1996 warrants are
priced at about 78p. If you add this to the exercise price you get 336p,
which is in line with the BTR Ordinary share price of around 334p. If
the latter goes up 10p or 3%, the warrants will also go up 10p or nearly
13%. This gearing is fine when the share price is rising, but of course
it works the other way when it is falling.
Given dealing costs and your small holding, it is not worth selling
the warrants in the market. You should just hold on to them, not
forgetting, however, either to exercise or sell them before the expiry
date, as after this they are worthless.

FEW OF us have the luxury of building up our own art collection, but
we all take for granted a few household essentials -- tableware,
furniture, clocks -- and if they are beautiful, so much the better. This
is what an exhibition, Essentials: Made to be Used, at the Roger
Bilcliffe gallery, Glasgow, is all about.
It offers a rare opportunity to view some of the best contemporary
metalwork, tableware, furniture and ceramics by leading designers. A
pure silver fruitbowl, brass letter-openers in cunning holders, a forged
steel dinner gong and even a titanium saccharine dispenser are among
these intriguing, often innovative pieces. This is art made to be
enjoyed, as artist Lynn Park, who also organised the exhibition, pointed
out.
Certainly Lynn Park's own curiously animated salt and pepper shakers
would act as an icebreaker at dinner parties. Drinking red wine would
become even more of a pleasure when sipping from Wally Gilbert's
organically patterned goblets, and who could resist Denise Clarke's
silver perfume bottles with their glittering rock crystal stoppers?
Every design is coherent in its purpose. Jose Arriaga's furniture,
with its clever blend of Basque craftsmanship with modern steel and
glass, or John Macguire's glossy ceramics may be works of art, but they
are primarily functional.
Perhaps, to contradict Oscar Wilde, all art is not quite useless.
* Essentials: Made to be Used will run until April 26 at Roger
Billcliffe fine art, 134 Blythswood Street, Glasgow G2 4EL, tel: 041-332
4027.

THE United Kingdom Shareholders' Association -- the independent body
which aims to give private investors a voice in the country's boardrooms
-- is launching a Scottish campaign today.
Nigel Dewar Gibb, who set up House of Fraser's employee profit-sharing
share scheme in 1979 and still administers it from Glasgow within the
Fayeds' Harrods Holdings, is leading the membership recruitment drive
north of the Border.
A few hours before the Grand National is run at Aintree, members
attending the inaugural meeting of the association's Scottish branch, in
Perth, will be emphasising their view of shares as ownership contracts
rather than betting slips.
Established three years ago and claiming to be the first financially
independent organisation speaking for private shareholders, the UK
Shareholders' Association now has more than 300 members.
However, an ambitious Mr Dewar Gibb believes that, out of about eight
million private shareholders in the UK, the association should be able
to drum up a membership of a few thousand.
Pointing out that about a dozen of the major pension funds could
virtually sell off all of Britain's industry on a whim, Mr Dewar Gibb is
in no doubt about the need for private investors to find strength in
unity.
Touching on the thorny issue of boardroom pay at British Gas, Mr Dewar
Gibb said: ''When questions of corporate governance have come up in the
House of Commons, the Government response, albeit slightly U-turned now,
has always been that this is a matter for the shareholders.
''If you are a shareholder what are you going to do -- travel down to
London to stand up at the British Gas meeting on your hind legs and say:
'You are getting paid too much'?''
There is little doubting that Mr Dewar Gibb knows the needs of private
shareholders, having in 1979 allocated shares to more than 20,000 House
of Fraser employees, many of whom had never previously had any interest
in the stock market.
The association has already attracted the attention of some big names,
including Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the committee of the same name
which was charged with examining corporate governance.
Geoff Lindey, chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds'
investment committee, joined Sir Adrian at a conference staged by the
association in York in October.
Today's meeting in Perth's City Mills Hotel will be attended by UK
Shareholders' Association chairman Donald Butcher.
Professor Joseph Lamb, chairman of the Save British Science
Association, will address the meeting. He is currently in the spotlight
as leader of a British Gas private shareholders' group campaigning for
restraint in boardroom pay.

* I hold 1223 T&amp;N Plc and 2141 HKSB Holdings Ordinary shares. In
respect of each holding I opted for an enhanced dividend, and as a
result I received 66 and 72 new shares respectively.
I have been unable to trace the market value of these shares at
November 4 and June 9, 1994, and am unable to determine the figures of
tax and net dividend which I require to have for my income tax return.
Could you please advise me how the figures should be calculated for
income tax purposes?
* The dates you have mentioned are the first days of dealing in the
new shares, and the net dividends are calculated by multiplying the
value of the shares on these dates by the number of shares that you
received.
In the case of T&amp;N the value on November 4, 1994, was 217p and the
number of shares received was 66. Therefore, the net is #143.22. The tax
credit is calculated by dividing this amount by 80 and multiplying by 20
(to give 25%, the basic rate of tax) which results in a final figure of
#35.80.
The value of the HKSB shares at June 9, 1994, was 731.5p. By using the
same method of calculation, the net dividend is #526.68 and the tax
credit #131.67.
Some other points to note are that these dividends are entered on a
separate section in your income tax return; the net dividends are also
the costs for capital gains purposes of the new shares, and the tax
credits are not repayable in any circumstances. The first day dealing
values are available from your stockbroker.
* I have a fixed-interest joint account with a building society
involving my wife and myself. My wife has died and I contacted the
society to ask the position regarding return of the investment which is
fixed until the end of June 1996.
The brochure states that in the event of death the investment is
returnable without any kind of penalty. The society replied that the
request for return must be irrevocable and the return without penalty
was at the discretion of the investment manager who could impose a
penalty dependent on the individual case, even if the investment was
then transferred to another internal account.
It would not state what the penalty was likely to be. I would
appreciate your opinion on this matter.
* It is understandable that the decision is irrevocable. But if the
brochure said there was no penalty for return of funds on death, then
the society can hardly decide to change the rules now.
You should reply sending a photocopy of the appropriate page of the
brochure, pointing out the relevant passage, and demand that your money
is returned to you immediately and without penalty.
* My mother, aged 72, has her savings in two deposit accounts at the
Royal Bank. As a non-taxpayer she completed the appropriate forms some
years ago to allow interest to be paid to her gross. After my father's
death she added my name as a signatory to the account as she wanted to
ensure that sufficient funds would be available if anything was to
happen to her.
I explained to her that this might result in the interest being paid
less tax, but she was not bothered about this. I notified the bank that
I was a taxpayer and gave them the details asked for, and they said that
they would deal with it.
I would be grateful if you would advise me of the actual tax position,
as I have not seen any adjustments in my notice of coding.
* It may be that when your mother added your name she converted the
bank accounts into joint accounts. If so, you are each entitled to half
of the interest.
It is possible for the bank to allocate the interest in equal shares
and to continue to pay the amount due to your mother without deduction
of tax. The amount due to you will have basic rate tax deducted and no
adjustment to your coding will be required unless, of course, you are
liable to pay tax at the higher rate.
You may want to check with the bank whether the ownership of the funds
remains in your mother's name, and if although you have rights as a
signatory this is for administration purposes only. If so, she is
entitled to the total interest.
The bank should be able to clarify precisely the position on legal
ownership of the accounts, which will in turn determine the tax
situation.

GLASGOW-based Gas Measurement Instruments has been bought from an
undisclosed vendor by its existing management which has been backed by
3i and the Clydesdale Bank.
The company designs and manufactures electronic gas detection
equipment with both portable and fixed systems.
Managing director Derek Manson, who led the management buy-out team,
said that it is intended that exports should rise from 40% of turnover,
currently about #6m, to 60% in four years.
The company employs 90 people of whom 70 are in Renfrew and the rest
throughout the UK.
There have been approaches from various quoted companies to acquire
the business but it was decided to go down the MBO route.
The total financing package, including working capital, is thought to
be in excess of #5m with the asset base being about #3.5m.

LLOYD'S of London is proposing an auction scheme for members to buy
and sell participations in underwriting syndicates.
At present a member can resign from a syndicate and his participation
is passed on to another member. For the better-performing syndicates
there is often a waiting list to gain participation in it or personal
contacts secure entry.
The new system will enable members to realise value for their
participations and make entry into particular syndicates more open.
Lloyd's has issued a consultative document calling for reponses by the
end of the month. It is hoped to have the system in auction in July and
August in respect of the underwriting year 1996.
The participation rights to be auctioned will refer to future results
of the syndicate not any past liabilities the member may have.
The auction system will reduce the concern raised by some Lloyd's
observers that managing agents will tend to favour corporate members
when allocating existing capacity released by resignations.
Nicholas Adams, a director of Christie Brockbank Shipton, a Lloyd's
Members' Agency, commented: ''This development is extremely exciting and
can only be good for names (members). The acid test will come when we
see what people are prepared to pay to get on to which syndicates.''

WHAT price Scotland's churches? I am prompted to ask this question in
the week that Canterbury Cathedral has announced it is joining the
number of historic English places of worship which now charge visitors a
substantial fee for entering their hallowed walls.
Begun by Ely Cathedral, the practice arose out of financial
desperation being faced by the C of E and the fact that while many of
great religious buildings of Britain are owned by the state while being
operated by the church, there are some which face huge costs beyond
their means. The issues are neatly caught by the Joanna Trollope serial,
The Choir, which is approaching its climax on television.
However, the main reason for asking what price we put on Scotland's
churches is the publication this week of a new booklet to promote them
-- and they are all free! Based on the Scotland's Gardens Scheme (which
lists a network of public and private gardens which may be visited),
Scotland's Churches Scheme lists 128 churches of interest which are
open, either all year round or at stated times, for visitors.
Launched in 1994, only now is it able to list its network. Its
director is the vivacious Christine Milligan who acquired an attraction
for church-crawling when she was a linchpin in St Mary's, Haddington,
which regularly won awards for its visitor-friendly ways.
The scheme has a panel of trustees which include the Episcopalian
Primus, Richard Holloway, and an advisory council which includes the
Very Rev Professor James Whyte whose succinct summary of Scottish church
history in the booklet accompanying the scheme is as neat and balanced
about our controversial church history as it may be possible to get.
But to a modern secular public it is largely a secret history. For
them what lies behind the closed doors of the church they walk past
every day, is esoteric and occult. And the closed doors (save for Sunday
services) are themselves a scandalous symbol. They give, in PR terms,
the image of a shut-out.
A quick perusal of the 128 churches in the booklet reveals a wide
spectrum. From St Athernase Kirk in Leuchars, a Norman church from the
twelfth century, through the Covenanter Memorial Kirk at Drumclog, to
the first church extension between the wars (High Cartyne) and the Coia
RC church built in 1940 in Rutherglen (St Columbkille's). There are
country kirks and city kirks, with symbols indicating whether there are
disabled access, toilets on the premises, and refreshments available.
What does come as a surprise are the omissions. The welcoming St
Mungo's Cathedral in Glasgow is there, but not St Giles' in Edinburgh or
Paisley Abbey. Does one detect a sniff of snot? Among the other
omissions are some extremely attractive kirks with a very positive
attitude to visitors, for example Biggar.
Perhaps many smaller churches do not yet know about the scheme. Some
will feel that their UP temple is hardly the stuff of which pilgrimage
is made, and fail to register from humility (albeit this is a quality
which is not usually in abundance among officebearers of former UP
churches).
Others might be put off by the effort necessary to staff and support
the commitment to open the church on certain days. What if no-one turns
up? The answer is to make the scones so irresistible that even if they
don't come for the preaching they will come for the purvey.
What is also not realised is the superb opportunity for education and
outreach which open-door churches provide. Having taken parties of
primary-school and nursery-school children round Kinning Park within the
past year, I realise that some of them are in a church for the first
time, while others show interest in having the purpose of various items
of church furniture explained to them.
Even if the building itself is not stunning, a modest exhibition could
be mounted of artefacts such as ladles for collecting the offering (a
facet of my former Kirk in Abernyte). Or a carpenter could mock up a
''cutty stool'' to illustrate the system of church courts which dealt
with moral offences. Extracts from the kirk-session minutes from these
disciplinarian days could be displayed.
The St Mungo Museum in Glasgow has been criticised for its failure to
highlight the Scots church heritage of the past 400 years. Here then is
the opportunity -- if you're not invited to join them, then beat them at
their own game by turning churches into places which attract visitors.
It is a sad reflection on Scotland that with our religious heritage we
can only muster 128 entries in such a catalogue. I look forward to the
success of the scheme and hope it will not be long before the entries
increase tenfold.
There is no use telling others to do it without pitching in oneself
and that means registering my own kirk (even if I have to bake the
scones myself for the coffee lounge). It is not as if the #30
registration fee to be included in the booklet is exorbitant. Scotland's
Churches Scheme even promises to send, after registration, a free bundle
of booklets which can be sold in the church to recoup the cost.
The address to write to is: Scotland's Churches Scheme, Main Street,
Gifford, East Lothian EH41 4QH.

OIS International Inspection, which provides testing and inspection
services to the oil industry, is pinning its hopes on a new management
team after a collapse in profits last year.
As a result of a downturn in demand, sales dropped 18% to #38.4m,
while profits tumbled from #2.2m to just #144,000. Administrative and
financial functions are now located in the Aberdeen and Stockton
premises.
Nick Browne, formerly with Balfour Beatty and Costain, has been
installed as chief executive, a new finance director has been appointed
and management reorganised. The group said its decision to pay even a
nominal final dividend of 0.1p reflects its confidence in the changes
introduced to restore profitability.
The new management team is pursuing a cost-cutting programme and is
aiming to strengthen the engineering and technical services resources
and secure further onshore and offshore inspection management contracts
in the UK and overseas.
OIS shares slipped 3p to 21p, where the group is capitalised at just
#6m.

<TEXT>
BELFAST'S biggest industrial employer, the Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard,
saw pre-tax losses treble to #16.9m in 1994.
The figure comprised a loss on operations of #7.2m and an increase in
the provision for estimated future losses on contracts of #10.8m.
An exceptional credit of #1.1m prevented the final loss being even
worse. The yard said the figures were a ''most unsatisfactory result''.
The largest single contributory factor was provision for the loss
expected to arise on a tanker order with a scheduled delivery date of
August 1996.
The shipyard said the contract for the vessel was accepted to provide
continuity of work. Its value reflected the weakness of prevailing
market conditions and prices.

Rewards for enduring the loneliness of the long-distance writer are
coming thick and fast for Colin MacDonald, but it was not always like
that, reports George Hume
AS Colin MacDonald settled into the best seat in Edinburgh's Royal
Lyceum Theatre this week to enjoy the first night of The Gowk Storm --
billed as a story of passion and innocence lost -- he thought of a
filing-cabinet drawer at home stuffed to the brim with rejection slips.
He watched his work unfold on stage -- not a new experience for the
writer from Dornoch but the first time that anything he has written has
been staged in the legitimate theatre.
He has almost certainly entertained you already . . . a Dr Finlay's
Casebook on television, a heroic slice of Sharpe's Honour which cost
#1.75m to put on your small screen, a virtual library of other
television and radio plays.
Two television drama series are currently being whacked out and the
writing goes on -- all on a keyboard in a suburban room in Edinburgh:
children Calum, nine, and Iain, six, are excluded. No radio, no phone.
Successful output demands the loneliness of the long-distance writer . .
. only dreams of schemes to keep cats from the diners on the garden
bird-table are allowed to interrupt the muse.
As writers go, MacDonald would have to be reckoned in the marathon
mould when tenacity and determination for ultimate success are measured.
Through lean years and a snowstorm of rejection slips, every time the
mail arrived he battled on, learning the hard way that: ''When a thing
doesn't work, going at it doesn't make it any better -- it just makes it
a bigger mistake.''
He recalls a novel -- a first love never seen in print.
''I was working with the BBC when I started the book -- going home
every day for three years to write another few hundred words. It
collected 17 rejection slips and the bottom drawer of my filing cabinet
is stuffed with many more gathered over a 10-year period.
''A television play -- back it came. A radio play -- back it came. A
novel -- likewise. Failures maybe, or masterpieces ahead of their time.
But they are not discarded. I save my failures on the basis that, some
day . . . ''
Today, those tough lessons of youthful enthusiasm support a tower of
success.
MacDonald is a hot property in the world of tele-film scripts and
admits that success brings its own disciplines: ''There are times when
it is seven days a week. A lot of pressure -- what Raymond Carver called
The Paddle Steamer Days. There is a very good living to be had as a
regular writer on a high-figure soap but I would not do that by choice
-- I do not want to inhabit someone else's characters.
''But doing what I am doing means I have to think about writing to
deadline, writing for money.''
Businesslike approach notwithstanding, Colin MacDonald can still
scarcely believe that he can make a good living from activities close to
his heart from boyhood -- one of them writing.
He said: ''At school I was always getting the belt because I was a
daydreamer . . . quite interesting to think that daydreaming is now what
I do for a living.''
That school was Dornoch Primary where, in Primary 4, a teacher, Miss
Grant, fired his enthusiasm for the written word, especially those words
he had written himself.
''One day Miss Grant read Horatius by Macaulay,'' he said. ''I thought
it was fantastic. I could imagine it -- weapons glinting in the sun. I
was there. That afternoon could have gone on for years.
''Then she asked us all to write an essay on what she had read. When
they were handed back, with marks, I didn't get mine and she said:
'There is one essay here . . .'
''And I thought: 'This is it -- the belt.'
''But no. On the basis that nothing is perfect -- obviously a
Calvinist -- she gave my essay nine-and-a-half marks out of 10 and read
it to the class. I was transported -- my words being read to others.''
Wick High School saw the back of him at the age of 17 and the Mearns
Leader got a new cub reporter.
During his year there, MacDonald had the task of delivering some of
the papers on publication night, each Thursday collecting 3500 copies
from the print works at Montrose and touring in an old Bedford van
through St Cyrus, Inverbervie, Kinneff, and Johnstown -- a duty that
brought the pleasure of pointing out his own reports to the newsagents
to whom he delivered: a teenage continuation of nine-and-a-half out of
10 at Dornoch Primary.
On to the Press and Journal, four years in Peterhead and Aberdeen --
still with the urge to make his mark as a writer -- and so to the BBC
and a start on the novel that never made it.
The light on the road to full-time writing came late one afternoon in
BBC Radio Scotland's Edinburgh newsroom.
MacDonald has clear recall: ''It was a moment of awareness. It was
just before 5pm and there was a panic. I said to myself: 'I'm 29 and I
have always wanted to be a writer'.''
At which point, mind made up and wife Viviene happy to support the
family by teaching, he waved farewell to Aunty, got an Enterprise
Allowance of #40 a week for a year, and set to with his typewriter, baby
Calum in attendance.
Radio scripts ran out at one page per minute on air. Reams of paper
were consumed.
The breakthrough came when a play was sold to Stewart Conn, then
senior producer of radio drama at BBC Scotland.
The author says: ''Stewart Conn's acceptance came at a time when
fortunes were low.''
Shortly afterwards, three television plays were bought by the BBC,
other avenues opened, and business began to boom.
Today, the work pattern is three hours in the morning and two in the
afternoon -- a period open to arcane pleasure such as when writing
Sharpe's Honour for Central Films. The fancy took hold to write a scene
calling for a thousand French soldiers to come over a hill. MacDonald
remains delighted with the realisation of a boyhood dream.
''I just wrote in the thousand French soldiers and they had to provide
them. The film was shot in Crimea and cost #1.75m to make. Write it in
-- see it happen.''
What MacDonald wants to tackle now is a long-running series -- a task
that would still give him time to pick up sons Calum and Iain from
school in the afternoons and keep the neighbours guessing.
The thought amuses him. ''My neighbours, I am sure, think I am idle.
They see me about the house during the day, picking the boys up from
school, and say: 'This man is doing nothing'.''
Relaxation comes in the form of books, playing five-a-side football,
swimming and going to the pictures.
Inevitably there is another side to success . . .
''There are dark days when it is not working. But I persevere -- I
have to. There are times when I wish I had a real job. Lack of contact
with people requires a strong character. But no regrets. It has been
such a great adventure.''
* The Gowk Storm is at the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh until
April 22.

BY the time you're reading this, most of the dust will be settling
after the skirmishes of local government elections. For some reason, the
English will still be expressing surprise that the Tories are minor
players in Scottish politics, while faceless men from all sides will be
more than happy with the way things went, thank you very much, but if I
were the Labour Party I'd be desperately worried, blah, blah. Perhaps
its just my area, but it's been the quietest campaign that I can
remember. Only two leaflets have come through the door, and not one
canvasser has been on my doorstep.
This disdain for my vote may be a sign that the major parties have
finally cottoned on to the fact that the general public couldn't care
less about local politics. Admittedly, this year is a bit unusual, and
none of us appreciates the Government's cynical gerrymandering. The
Tories, however, can rest assured that we would like it even less if we
knew what it was. In the main, as long as the buses still run and the
schools stay open, then whether our local councillor is an ambitious
businessman or a bored housewife isn't worth getting excited about.
The soap opera effect ensures that we're quite taken with the General
Election. That's real power. At least General Election winners get to
make important decisions, not just agonise over whether the new twin
town should be Drabville in France or Dismalschtag in East Germany.
The quality of twin tiwns really gives the game away. You never see
anywhere rejoicing that they've twinned with Paris or Rome. No, ''twin
town'' is modern-day code for ''town equally devoid of character, so
desolate in fact that it makes this dump look like Miami Beach''.
Twinning is a council's way of telling you to look on the bright side.
The turnout at local elections proves that people view them as
small-league politics, as a psephological Vauxhall Conference Beazer
Homes effort. Many people feel that the local candidates are just a
bunch of losers who haven't got what it takes for the cut and thrust of
the big boys' game down at Westminster.
Look through the campaign leaflets (you'll find them in the bin, just
beside your polling card), and be amazed at the lack of talent on show.
Looking at the list of candidates in my constituency, I have to assume
that the teaching unions have, in local party politics, found an
alternative to ME for bored teachers. Don't get the two mixed up. One
involves long spells of enforced inactivity at taxpayers' expense, while
the other requires a doctor's line. The place of women in politics has
been enhanced by the enforced adoption of women-only shortlists for
Labour candidacy. While this may transform the Westminster pot pourri
sales figures, most will agree that the Labour Party, instead of
excluding men, should be excluding talentless no-hopers -- but maybe
that's too radical!
My grandfather was a councillor, and in his quieter moments he
reckoned that the way council business was conducted proved that it was
mostly a matter of the half-arsed trying halfheartedly to get things
half right. Given that most of our representatives are so inept, the
extent of their influence is quite remarkable. Within two minutes of
their election, they have the capacity to assume control of where, what,
and when we can drink.
They can close down shops, ban films, and grill our most senior police
officers. Maybe instead of allowing psychopaths to stand, we should
immediately ban. We should instead institute a system similar to jury
duty, where people would be drafted in for periods of up to five years,
avoidable only on production of a doctor's note. I realise that juries
can make stupid decisions, but they wouldn't build motorways we don't
need, and non-politicians wouldn't have the brass neck to go on foreign
jaunts to Florida while maintaining that it's to research the recent
developments in swimming pool design.
I accept that there are a great number of people around this country
who run for office, people with experience and expertise that makes them
ideal candidates to serve their community. I know that, but why is it
the others who get elected? The cliche that a donkey under a Labour
banner would win by a landslide in most parts of Scotland has only
become a cliche because it's basically true.
The only good thing to be said for the intrusion of party politics
into the local government arena is that you can decide who to vote for
without actually reading any of the guff that usually comes through the
door. Voters should be grateful, as the campaign leaflet is one of the
last bastions of meaningless, tedious, monologues (this is another one).
Why do candidates always have to put in pictures of them posing with
their spouses and children? If having a family was an electoral asset
then slogans would be interesting, like ''Vote for MacDonald: he's done
it at least twice!'' Having said that, posing with the family can work
if the kids are older than 12: any picture of a candidate with teenagers
will get the sympathy vote every time.
I know that it's the cynical nineties, and I realise that we're all
getting a bit sick of party politicking, but it still doesn't justify
standing for election as an independent candidate. Your family and
friends will vote for you. That woman that you speak to in the newsagent
will, if you're lucky, vote for you. If you're standing to make a local
statement, then that's acceptable but it doesn't mean that anyone who
doesn't know you will vote for you. Joe Public has an innate sympathy
for the equation ''Independent Candidate equals Nutter''. Except, of
course, if Joe Public is a teuchter.
There are two reasons why teuchters vote for independent candidates:
1. He's probably related to him, and 2. They're also the kind of people
who believe that God cares whether the Stornoway chip shop opens on a
Sunday.
The furore over the Major interview on Panorama has puzzled me. Not
since El Dorado has so much cash been spent in an attempt to bore the
entire nation. The SNP must have been pretty aggrieved at all the fuss:
I can't think of a better vote winner for them than having the Prime
Minister on telly on Monday.
Does anyone believe that an appearance by John Major will make anyone
vote for the Tories? I could have understood the fuss if they had
interviewed a Conservative that Scots people respected, like . . . er,
can I come back to you on this one?

A REAL BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra special on Thursday night. An
extravaganza, and a riot of sound and colour. The last of the SSO's
Cutting Edge series of concerts (and what looked like one of the best
attendances) was also something of a phenomenon.
A survey of South American music with lively conductor Odaline de la
Martinez, comprised five works: one UK premiere, one world premiere, and
three unknown pieces. See imaginative planning? But not only that, the
orchestra required was so large that the City Hall had to be transformed
for the occasion.
Downstairs seating was cleared, the band brought off the stage and on
to the ground floor, while the audience surrounded them upstairs and on
the stage. And the wall of sound that rose up from the floor was
immense.
The quality of the music itself was varied. There was a tendency among
some of the composers to go at it a bit too long, and lose the thread.
Such was the case with Amadeo Holden's Overture on Popular Cuban Themes
and Chavez's Sinfonia India. Old Villa-Lobos's Bachianas Brasilieras No
2 showed them all a trick or three in structure and control of colour.
The sensation was young Gabriela Ortiz's Concierto Candela, which
received a dazzling performance from percussionist Heather Corbett: a
tour de force of composition and a spectacular display of rhythmic
virtuosity from the SSO's principal percussionist.
The world premiere of Musica Ciudadana, by Silvina Milstein, a more
abstract affair, contained some atmospheric Ivesian moments. But its
claim of a ''strong sense of tonal direction'' and its basis in a
''simple song'' were completely elusive.

THE pound largely shrugged off the devastation of the Tory
representation in Scotland as the overall result came as no great
surprise.
However, the currency remains generally weak because of the continuing
political uncertainties.
By the close the trade-weighted index had fallen 0.2, down a full
point on the week which will focus Bank of England Governor Eddie
George's attention ever more on the risk of higher import costs sucking
in inflation which would need to be countered by an increase in interest
rates.
The dollar was again in trouble for part of the day, hitting an
all-time low against the yen at Y83.65 in the Far East.
However, there was a lower-than-expected rise in US employment of
203,000. That meant that an increase in US interest rates was now
slightly less likely and so support for the longer-term security of the
currency was missing.
Analysts are now suggesting that the Fed will do nothing until May 23
at the earliest when the next FOMC policy meeting is being held.
There is some concern that there could be large sell-offs of dollars
by some Far East central banks as a result of its continuing weakness.

STREET fans have been aghast to learn that the gimlet-eyed houri of
the Rovers Return wants to quit. Cultural commentators may search for
significance in the decision by Bet Gilroy (nee Lynch) to hang up her
cleavage scaffolding following an imbroglio with executives of
Coronation Street. They might even detect a touch of post-modern irony
in the frankly impertinent offer by impressionist and chanteuse, Faith
Brown, to climb into her leopardskin pants when they are barely cooled.
The rest of us think she's an impudent floosy and an imposter. In as
much as it is possible to be a national icon and all-round family
entertainer by flashing your bristols, Bet did her best.
It was Nabokov who described the novel as a magic democracy in which
each character, however minor, is given his or her moment in the
authorial sun. The writers and producers of soap operas long ago rumbled
this notion and took it for their own.
Aside from the really big soap stars -- Hilda Ogden, Dirty Den, J R,
Charleen -- we have seen the flourishing of lesser but no less
influential characters such as Chalky, Noleen (in the much under-rated
Flamingo Road), Jack Duckworth and, one of my personal favourites,
Sharon from EastEnders who has offered proof of the theory first
suggested by Lucy in Dallas that ectomorphs can have fun and that you
don't need a hard neck, or even a neck, to be brassy.
It's an enduring human wish to give some sort of moral meaning to
everything, a truism which the producers of soaps understand very well.
Thus they offer sharp human perspective on issues that are often debated
as if they are simply ethical gymnastics. Take murder for instance.
Channel 4's Brookside had life breathed into it, somewhat ironically
it must be admitted, by stashing a dead cast member under a patio and
devoting two years to seeing whether or not it would play havoc with the
crazy paving.
I almost succumbed to a Sky subscription recently (I said almost) when
it showed a series called Models Inc, starring Dallas' voluptuan Linda
Gray, or Sue Ellen as was. In the grip of powerful emotion her features
would shake like a frantic polecat on heat. But such was her striking
power as a role model for soap stars to come, she made Bet seem sadly
like someone in elastic stockings and fluffy mules, provocatively
uncrossing her varicosed legs in the snug.
Sue Ellen's finest moment was when she ran away with Dusty, a bluff
man whose emotion had been suppressed into a persistent cough and a
tendency to spit on the sidewalk while simultaneously walking with the
wide-legged gait of someone who had had a wee accident.
The Oz influence on the soap opera boom clearly broke historical
precedent. The genre had always been regarded as escapist. The success
of Crossroads, for example, was generally attributed to the
urban-dweller's secret dream of rural retreat in a motel with shaking
walls. Dallas and Dynasty were watched because they permitted us
vicarious immersion in 10-gallon glamour.
The popularity of Neighbours and Home and Away wrecked this thesis.
Although it later featured death, divorce, and a suicide rate to rival
any US dramas, it first emerged as an unusually low-incident soap. A
cliffhanger was when Helen's hairdryer fused. Helen, the series
matriarch, the Electra of the Melbourne suburbs, was given the
philosophical lines, such as ''things are getting pretty bad in Ramsey
Street'' after a particularly long bout of event dementia involving
three deaths, a broken heel, and a dead dingo in the garage. But
production values remained thrillingly minimal. Newly paraplegic
accident victims' limbs twitched in hospital beds.
Still, despite the intrusion of transcontinental intruders, the Street
retains its place in the cultural pantheon as the seminal soap. How then
to bring a fitting close to a character of such national cultural
signifance as Bet? Perhaps a gang of Yardies could burst into The Rovers
wielding Uzies (how far is Weatherfield from Moss side?) but it wouldn't
look right somehow -- as if Hyacinth Bucket suddenly succumbed to Aids
or Victor Meldrew was discovered trading in child pornography.
There has to be something like a major romantic disappointment, which
soaps do so well. Something similar to when Emily Bishop's marriage was
called off, in one of those scenes constructed almost entirely from
close ups -- a soap shorthand for would you look at this acting.
She could always run away with Percy Sugden and do us all a great
favour.

IS NOTHING sacred? Well, nothing's new. With Pongo, Perdita and 99
puppies at present back in cinemas plans are going ahead to remake
Disney's 1961 classic 101 Dalmatians. There's a biography due any moment
from Valerie Grove on the intriguing life of the late Dodie Smith who
penned the tale of Cruella De Vil's lust for a not very politically
correct fur coat.
Disney want to turn the animated adventure into a live-action film.
But who will play the fiendish Cruella? Disney producers have been
talking to Joan Collins for the role of the evil dognapper. A
cigarette-holder and retrieval of the Dynasty shoulder-pads and she's
all set.
Tommy Lee Jones has a work phobia. He's everywhere. The Oscar winner
for The Fugitive was splendid in Blue Sky with Jessica Lange, plays
villain ''Two-face'' in the soon-to-be-seen Batman Forever, was baseball
legend Ty Cobb in Cobb and is at present being seen in America in Good
Old Boys. Next he's working for Steven Spielberg in Men in Black based
on a new adventure comic strip just arrived in US newspapers. Spielberg,
who grew up on comic books, believes the strip will be a winner and he's
been more right than wrong.
She wins Oscars and also big deals -- Jodie Foster wearing her
director / producer hat has signed a distribution deal with Paramount
Pictures for her Home for the Holidays. In the comedy, that other Oscar
winner (The Piano) Holly Hunter is reunited with her relatives and
friends who include Anne Bancroft, Robert Downey Jr, Dylan McDermott,
Steve Guttenberg, and Geraldine Chaplin for the US Thanksgiving weekend.
Other news on Geraldine Chaplin: she is leading the Chaplin family
fight against the publication of Hidden Star: Oona O'Neill Chaplin,
which has been written by the little clown's daughter-in-law Patrice
Chaplin. She says her former husband Michael has given his approval. The
rest of the family are dismayed at the portrait of Chaplin's fourth wife
which claims she was a sex-mad alcoholic.
Director Robert Altman, M*A*S*H, Nashville, The Player and the present
Pret-A-Porter, is changing tack. His latest will be Kansas City, a
Prohibition gangster-era movie. One of the leads is expected to be Harry
Belafonte. Altman is also talking to Kim Basinger and Jennifer Jason
Leigh.
Anthony Hopkins looks set to play Nixon for director Oliver Stone.
He's denied a report that he has a new theory for his film based on the
life of Richard Nixon. One early script purportedly had Nixon putting a
hit squad on Fidel Castro but the lads missed the Cuban and took out JFK
instead.
We've seen Coppola's Dracula and Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein and
now we have Howard's The Bride of Frankenstein to look forward to. The
casting? Scoop du jour: statuesque Geena Davis will do the shrieking
first managed by Elsa Lanchester in the original movie exactly 60 years
ago.
Davis's Thelma and Louise director Ridley Scott is to make White
Squall, about the 1961 ordeal of a sea captain and a group of teenage
boys whose ship sinks in a fierce Caribbean storm. With Jeff Bridges as
the main star it is at present filming near Malta.

IN THE late 1980s, there was considerable talk in Scotland of a
''Doomsday Scenario,'' where a Conservative majority in Westminster
might be achieved at the expense of no Scottish Conservative MPs.
Thursday's results in the elections to the new unitary authorities
delivered that scenario, at least in local government terms. In terms of
national share of the vote, the Tories have slumped to 11.3%, a result
which is even more severe than the regional council election total in
1994 of 13.7%.
Scottish Conservative Party leaders always have believed that their
vote would recover, as their modest increase in the 1992 General
Election suggested. However, it now seems clear that Scottish
Conservative Party fortunes have dipped so low, that they may not simply
be looking over the edge of the electoral abyss; they may have fallen
over it.
Given that the new unitary authorities will not be re-elected until
1999, Conservative influence has been reduced to a bare minimum, even in
some authorities where at least a share in power might have been
expected.
As a result, Conservative councillors have no opportunity to shape the
future direction and operation of the new councils. In addition, it
destroys the Conservatives' ability to claim success in local government
as a means to convincing electors in subsequent elections.
In local political terms, the next five years will be spent largely in
the wilderness, but what of the Conservatives ability to recover in
Scotland as a whole? There are a number of worrying signs.
First, the Conservatives are now consistently doing as badly as their
opinion poll ratings suggest. Their 11% share on Thursday matched
exactly the rating produced by the last System 3 poll in The Herald.
Sir Michael Hirst has frequently insisted that opinion polls in
Scotland give a false impression of his party's support. That argument
is now looking very weak indeed. The implication here is that the
bottomline Tory support has in real terms fallen below the 15-20% mark
which many had suggested would mark the end of Scottish Tory decline.
Secondly, the morale of party workers has hit the rocks. Many loyal
campaigners are now increasingly disillusioned by their efforts to win
back support, even in traditional heartlands such as Perth and Kinross,
and Eastwood.
The number of active members is dangerously low and their average age
of party members is over 60 years old. This can only cause problems in
the future, and is more likely to cause a downward spiral in Tory
campaigning activity over the next few years.
Any Conservative recovery in the future would have to be of remarkable
proportions if it is to be meaningful. Any modest recovery might give
heart but would not win influence.
There is now a danger for the whole of Scotland in that the Tories'
abject failure at the ballot box makes the parliamentary ''Doomsday
Scenario' closer to reality than it has ever been before. If that proves
to be the outcome of the next General Election, then it may well be not
the SNP or Labour to blame for the break-up of Britain, but the Tories
themselves.

Abortion issues still cause unease to many British people, not least
those unable to fit themselves into either polarised position forced by
this debate.
Sarah Nelson considers the arguments
THE spate of killings -- by American ''pro-life'' extremists -- of
abortion clinic staff has been making international headlines. And the
Pope's Encyclical of last week once again demonstrated his rigid
inflexibility on the issue of abortion, and drew predictable protest and
disagreement from liberal Catholics.
Thus the issue has been forced back into British consciousness; though
it has never -- even at the time of David Steel's original Abortion Bill
-- excited the fierce passions, nor seized the political centre stage,
that it has in countries like Ireland or the US. That in itself reflects
our widespread absence of powerful religious conviction allied to, or an
implicit part of, a broader political movement.
Yet abortion issues still cause unease to many British people, not
least those unable to fit themselves into either polarised position
forced by this debate.
The tempting way out has been an unhappy silence, for fear of
misunderstanding, recrimination, or accusations of disloyalty. That
course has been taken by more progressive Catholics, among others, and
by some feminists. But this has diminished the quality of debate and the
imaginative confrontation of hard ethical questions.
For many other non-discomfited and secular Britons, the issue is
frankly rather a yawn. Yet there are many striking things about the
whole debate.
First, like numerous other controversies among adults about children,
it is in fact remarkably little about the rights and wellbeing of
children. It is, crucially and internationally, about adults -- about
the status of, and attitudes to, women.
Secondly it is a debate where, unusually, logical holes can be picked
in most arguments used by both sides. That's a feature of controversies
which are really about something else, and perhaps it's time to
acknowledge that.
Thirdly, it is a debate that continually obscures or draws energy from
international confrontation of underlying, urgent, disturbing questions.
Why are countless female children aborted each week in India in the
first place? Why are many thousands of women, violently impregnated in
war, raped in the first place? Why are people in developing countries
often reluctant to use contraception, and would actually listening to
them help make campaigns more realistic and effective?
Fourthly, the debate has demanded morally absolute positions -- where
qualification is derided as feeble ''moral relativity'', or criticised
as lack of commitment to the women's cause. On the contrary, abortion
may precisely be an issue where translating principle and humanity into
policy demands accepting, and responding to, a complex range of
different situations.
Finally (a major question) why have abortion debates in several
countries (even, sometimes, our own) had such a pungent unsavoury aura
of ferocious nastiness, obsession, and extremism? This has produced, in
Ireland and the US, extraordinary personal vilification, intimidation,
and physical assault from sections of the ''pro-life'' lobby, ranging
from spitting in the street right through to murder. Let's return to
that conundrum . . .
As we said, a major feature of the abortion debate is that many
arguments on both sides fail to survive logical scrutiny. Consider first
the ''woman's right to choose''. Clearly, a developing foetus is
something more than simply a part of a woman's ''own body'', in the way
her arms or legs are. Again, sustainable or viable life is not a fixed
but a constantly changing concept, dependent on advances in medical
science.
To justify abortion by saying many foetuses will self-abort anyway is
a weak argument. There is no way of knowing if the particular one to be
terminated would have self-aborted or not. Usually indeed there is
nothing to suggest this.
There are special problems about calls for abortion on demand. For,
logically, this justifies terminations simply on grounds of sex, either
from personal taste or, more often, through the lower value put on
females -- a prejudice feminists strongly oppose and seek to change.
Feminists have been pushed into minimising the emotional effects of
abortion on women, which in some are very slight and in others lifelong
and traumatic. They are also squeezed into a corner by ultrasound and
other technological advances, which have visibly demonstrated the life,
recognisable humanity, and development of a foetus, even in the early
months. Because admitting this seems to play into the hands of religious
opponents, they can only describe such images as ''emotive'' or
''misleading'', instead of acknowledging reality and shifting the debate
on to when it may be justifiable to terminate life.
Liberal, secular views in general frequently duck all kinds of awkward
ethical issue, as disabled people know. Underlying many reasonable,
civilised views that handicapped foetuses ought to be terminated for
their own good are more primeval fears and distastes, especially about
mental disability, from the ''monster-in-the-attic'' legacy.
To turn to the ''pro-life'' lobby: it is difficult to prove that any
of us has automatic rights to life, or to anything -- such questions
still tangle and divide moral and political philosophers. Again,
logically ''pro-lifers'' should maintain the ultimate argument that even
a threat to the mother's life does not justify abortion. Yet this
position also reveals the obvious truth, that rights can be in serious
conflict and judgments must be made between them.
It is illogical to oppose contraception as well as abortion, when
countless thousands of abortions in, for instance, Eastern Europe (even
in Catholic Poland) have resulted directly from abysmal contraception
facilities.
There are major criticisms about hypocrisy and inconsistency. Many
''pro-lifers'' on the political Right hold very different views on the
right to life of criminals, dispossessed rioters, or even housebreakers,
and are extremely hawkish on war and peace. None of us is politically
consistent, but those who make ''the sanctity of life'' the central
plank of their crusade surely have a duty to work out more personal
consistency than that. It is also inconsistent to be so concerned about
children's lives before they are born and not to be equally concerned
about why in some countries and some situations, half or more of these
infants will die by the age of one.
In the Irish Republic -- and accepting the sincere, non-strident
anti-abortion views of thousands of Christians -- many ''pro-lifers''
are the same sort of people who have sustained a culture which drives
women to seek abortions, through shame, stigma, and the callous
treatment of unmarried mothers by families and institutions.
The pro-life lobby has minimised the emotional effects on women of
alternatives to abortion like adoption, which can be traumatic and
lifelong. In proclaiming the rights of handicapped foetuses, it has also
ignored the importance of social, institutional, or financial supports
for children and families, if the stress on both over decades is not to
become intolerable.
Finally, but very important, the issue of personal responsibility for
decisions is sidestepped. Surely, consent must be an integral part of
the sexual act which leads to conception, before a woman has any duty of
responsibility for bearing and raising a child. The stark reality for
millions of women worldwide is not this precious act of mutual love the
''pro-lifers'' proclaim sex to be about, but rape within or outside
marriage, incestuous abuse, or mass violation in war.
The current position of thousands of pregnant women raped in Rwanda or
the former Yugoslavia shows the absurdity of a simplistic approach, the
complexity of contributions to the rape, and the complexity of
consequences for the women.
The rapes themselves sprang from a mix of calculated humiliation and
denigration of women; the knowledge that the women's menfolk would then
reject them, through their own sexist, possessive assumptions; and a
deliberate, gleeful destruction of ethnic purity in the vanquished. For
the women, on top of the horror of multiple rapes and unsought
pregnancy, comes the prospect of a child who may look like the murderer
of their family, who will forever remind them of the days of their
shocking degradation, and who is likely to be despised and rejected.
It becomes hard to imagine how anyone could argue against making
abortion easily available in such circumstances. It is disturbing, too,
for all women that the widespread attitudes to their sex which such
multi-purpose sexual violence reveals has gained such a low priority in
international attention.
At the end of the day, this is why feminists internationally strongly
support liberal abortion laws, whatever their personal unease about
abortion. Because in countless situations and without their consent,
women are left ''holding the baby'' through imbalance of power,
treatment, and knowledge, whether it is extreme acts in war or mundane
inequalities, like the ''seduction'' over centuries of servant girls by
wealthy and powerful men. Until these injustices are genuinely tackled
by societies, access to abortion will remain a vital last-ditch right
for women, which reasserts some measure of control over their lives,
fertility, and self-respect.
The harder question, though, is whether the particular arguments used
in the debate have actually moved it on constructively, or have led into
various blind alleys. It may be time to ''cut the crap'' on both sides
and for everyone to acknowledge openly that the debate is about the
power and position of women, in society and within their own families.
This explanation of the real issue, the rights or the control of
women, makes sense of the peculiar virulence of ''pro-life'' extremists,
most of whom are conspicuously male. Southern Irish pro-choice
campaigners have had sentiments like, ''You should be f----d on your
hands and knees like dogs''. . . and worse. Abortion is also about sex
and dangerously so, and this injection of prurient interest and
projection, often by highly repressed individuals (some of whom are
celibate male clerics), seems to produce a unique, obsessive
unpleasantness.
This is the only explanation I have been able to reach after years of
puzzled thought. If correct, it suggests that more than anything else
these extremists need to stop and take a long, hard search of
themselves.
More optimistically, is there not a middle ground which many of us
with differing views and emotions on abortion can develop
constructively? Can we not agree that abortion is undesirable, has
emotional costs, and that the need for it should be minimised as far as
possible.
That it is about taking life, that sometimes this may be necessary or
justified, and that debates on this should be moved into the mainstream
of debate on similar difficult issues -- euthanasia, lifetaking in war,
criminal justice, strategies on terrorism, and many other situations.
That relatively -- but not absolutely -- liberal abortion law needs to
exist internationally, in order to protect women, in societies which
will remain profoundly unequal for the foreseeable future.
Such principles would focus more attention on the need to tackle the
unequal power of women in families and societies -- including the sexist
assumptions made about male and female sexuality. It would move the
debate forward on how to promote contraception campaigns internationally
which were effective, shaped through democratic participation by
ordinary people.
It would encourage hard thought about what social attitudes and
external supports parents need, before they can have a genuine choice
about whether to bring handicapped children into the world. And it would
shift ownership of the debate from the extremes, reducing in some
countries intimidation and the power of political blackmail. Alas, we in
Britain have little influence over American ferocities: but we may have
much to learn from sane Irish voices closer to home, and support to
offer them also.

HOW difficult it is to contemplate the Tories this morning. There is
no desire to prod their raw wounds, for they will bleed for long yet.
Their future is one of pernicious political anaemia, incapable of
improvement by any known transfusion. They are pallid shades in this
land and four weeks hence they will, in all probability, take on the
same hue in England and Wales. And yet, despite the very best
intentions; despite the desire not to be patronising or cruel; despite a
proper need to hold balance and fairness with sensible caution, there
was, yesterday, yet another cause to be irritated at these unfortunates.
Specifically, to be annoyed at the Prime Minister and his excuses.
As many commentators have noted, this is a peculiar man. The deeper he
sinks into the mire, the more he grins. The more his colleagues recoil
from him like the horrified characters of a Bateman cartoon, the more he
buries himself in stubbornness. His main explanation yesterday for the
disaster which has overtaken his Scottish colleagues was (and we must
suppose that he means this) the effect of Tory divisions. Here we find
him taking the Scottish Tory disaster and using it as a stick to beat
his party opponents. How misguided can a man be? The vast majority of
that large proportion of the Scottish electorate which voted for any
party other than his, do not give tuppence for Tory divisions. Very
probably they approve of them. They provide solace for opponents and
malicious amusement for those the Tories have hurt. Divisions? Cleave
them deeper, but by no means think that the general electorate cares.
Then we have those other Tories who shake their heads sadly and say
that all would be well if only the message could be put across with
greater effect. Once more we are with Major in the strangest sort of
political wonderland. What message is it that we have missed? The simple
truth is that the Tories are electorally lost because the public
understands their policies only too well.
Does Mr Major really believe that there are any Scots who have
misinterpreted his insulting and dismissive views on devolution for
Scotland? Are there sentient Scots unaware of Government policies
towards the National Health Service, the privatisation of railways, or
the twisting of labour rights which have led to such miserable job
insecurity? For the sake of sanity it is necessary to adapt a Democratic
slogan from the last presidential election in the United States. For the
Tories this morning it should read, ''It's the policies, stupid''.
And so, we look this morning at a Scottish political map which is
largely devoid of Tory presence or influence. This is not necessarily a
good thing for several reasons. The cause of political plurality in any
decent democracy is one that must be cherished. It cannot prosper in a
land which is so dominated by one political party, whether you subscribe
to its policies or not. We will come back to Scottish Labour and its
remarkable political dominance at another point, but wall-to-wall Labour
is not an unalloyed gift to the Scottish nation.
In this context it is remarkable that the Tories have not grasped the
nettle of proportional representation, at least at local level. We have
grave doubts about PR, though we are willing to acknowledge that it
comes in different varieties, some of which can represent the wishes of
an electorate while maintaining efficient administration. For the Tories
it could have represented salvation, but it is too late for that now.
Similarly, we hesitate to mention constitutional questions, yet the new
unitary authorities will face a peculiar situation when they take power
in a year, and it is one which does not reflect well on the governance
of Scotland. The Scottish Office and Mr Ian Lang will have considerable
powers to intervene in local government, yet what political legitimacy
can they claim to represent at the local level? This dissonance must be
addressed, and it is by no means certain that it can wait until the next
General Election.
The achievement of Scottish Labour is remarkable. It seems clear that
the votes which it gathered in bucketfuls represent, in a substantial
sense, the turning of the middle and professional classes of Scotland to
Labour and away from the Tories. There has always been, it is true, a
radical middle class in Scotland, but the vote in the local elections
represents with some clarity a positive vote for Labour rather than a
negative protest vote against the Tories. That said, Scottish Labour
should recall the Roman military victors who were accompanied on their
victory parades by a man whose duty it was to whisper the reminder in
their ear that, after all, they were still only mortal. Scottish Labour
must avoid triumphalism. Enjoy the success, by all means, but do not
give in to the arrogance of power; recall always that great success
implies great responsibilities, and resolve to deal with opponents
fairly.
Labour will not like that moralising tone, but that doesn't matter; we
are happy to be regarded as the ear-whisperers at the victory parade.
Nor will the Scottish National Party enjoy the self-evident comment that
it has not done as well as it had hoped. It had significant successes,
it is true. Many seats have been taken across the country and the Perth
and Kinross parliamentary seat looks likely to crown its achievements.
But it has not managed to penetrate the central belt of the country
where most of the population lives. Jim Sillars may be a loose, and now
departed, cannon, but he was talking simple commonsense when he said
years ago that success in the central belt was absolutely essential to
the SNP if it wished to grow and prosper. Nevertheless, the SNP will be
happy with its position as the second party and can rightly regard it as
a platform on which to build. The Scottish Liberal Democrats, as the
third party, have cause to be cautiously happy. They targeted their
efforts instead of scattering them, and they have found some deserved
and fertile ground.
But, again, like a tongue to an aching tooth, we are drawn back to the
Tories. A judgment has been delivered on them on grounds of national
policy and there was nothing that local policy could do to prevent it.
It is difficult to envisage what they can do in the next two years, and
even more worrying to contemplate the effect this might have on the
nation. They, more than anyone, must consider their position; but they
must do so honestly, plainly, and without the garnish of excuse.

TO those of us who vote Conservative in Scotland it seems ironic that
one of the protagonists (indeed the one who filed the complaint) in the
Panorama dispute is none other than a former BBC Scotland controller,
Pat Chalmers, now a professed Liberal Democrat.
That he was so largely involved in the matter is, in my opinion, very
serious as here is a man who has had great responsibility for moulding
public opinion in the past while with BBC Scotland, and here he is now
continuing to do so from an overtly political standpoint.
Incidentally, I thought his name and role in the affair would be
newsworthy but not a mention in BBC Radio news bulletin at 8am today --
another example of ''balanced'' reporting.
John Major is not after all, just the Leader of the Conservative
Party: he is the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and as such is
entitled to be heard and seen by all citizens at any time and not just
when Mr Chalmers and others feel it is right for him to do so.
I would give this same respect to a Prime Minister of any other
political persuasion, I hasten to add, because I believe in the people's
ability to make their own decisions on important matters.

THE results in the key battleground authorities proved to be a
remarkable success for Labour and a disaster for the Tories. For the SNP
and Liberal Democrats, there were mixed emotions.
Away from the glare of media coverage, many of the new authorities
produced results which were against the odds and which hold out new
messages about the political complexion of Scotland. Based on
comparisons with both the 1992 district elections and the 1994 regional
elections, our analyses can point to particular successes and failures
that may not have hit the headlines.
Overall, Labour has scored a spectacular triumph in capturing outright
control 20 of the 29 new councils. But what of its fortunes more
locally?
Our comparisons indicate that Labour has done worse than expected in
only two authorities, Highland, and Dumbarton and Clydebank -- but even
here by only perhaps one to two seats.
In some areas not known for the return of Labour councillors, Shadow
Scottish Secretary, George Robertson can be more than happy.
For example, in Dumfries and Galloway, Labour has ended up with 21
councillors where its expectations would have been around half that
number. This is an advance to a clear first place at least in terms of
the political parties in Dumfries and Galloway, where before there was a
near equal split between them and the other three main parties.
More rural success for Labour came in East Lothian, and in Moray, and
also Perthshire and Kinross, Labour gained more seats than expected.
This shows that Labour is not simply capable of success only in the
Central Belt.
The SNP has consolidated its position in rural Scotland and, in
particular, in its North-east strongholds. Yet, apart from Dumfries and
Galloway, the party has not made inroads in recent years in other rural
areas.
The results may have been a disappointment in the Central Belt for the
SNP, but in a lot of rural Scotland the picture is rosier.
In Highland, while not nearly touching power, the fielding of a large
number of candidates has produced a larger complement than our
comparison would have expected.
This pattern is repeated in a rural area where the Nationalists have
always done badly, the Borders. Here they gained twice as many
councilors as might have been expected.
However, the SNP lost ground in the Central Belt, which will be a
worry to leader Alex Salmond as he increasingly pushes his party towards
challenging Labour in ideological terms. West Lothian was of course
lost, but in Falkirk, the scale of the loss was even worse, and in
Edinburgh, the SNP now has no presence at all.
In recent years, the Liberal Democrats have used a targeting strategy
to increase their representation in the face of a weak overall share of
the vote. Thursday produced dividends for them. In 10 councils, their
representation was higher than might have been expected, in only five
was it lower.
Jim Wallace's party easily broke their 100 seats target overall and
made encouraging gains in East Dunbartonshire and Fife.
The Liberal Democrats' strategy is limiting. It means that the UK
criticism that they are a regional party looks increasingly applicable
to Scotland as well.
For the Tories there is almost no good news. In our comparisons on how
many seats they would be expected to take, we found that in 28 of the 29
councils they did worse than expected. Only in Highland, where it was
expected that they would have one seat, did they actually achieve that.
However, in some areas the local conditions have led to Tory
representation not being reduced out of sight; for example, in Aberdeen
and in Edinburgh. That can only be cold comfort.

TOLD by an Idiot is the new name for the John Wright Company, the
outfit that generated a buzz on the Edinburgh Fringe two years ago with
On the Verge of Exploding. The biographies of company members read like
a check-list of contemporary British physical theatre: Theatre de
Complicite, David Glass Ensemble, Trestle . . . and in case you're in
any doubt, there's an advert for The Right Size on the back of the
programme.
So no surprises when I'm So Big takes us into that curious
middle-European world of oddball, slightly remedial characters, with
stilted language, funny accents, and bodies that ripple with neurotic
mannerisms.
Partly inspired by Emir Kusterika's film Time of the Gypsies -- in
that it is about modern-day gipsies scraping a living in an unforgiving
industrialised landscape -- this devised piece tells a simple story of
two brothers who kidnap a prostitute in the hope that she can bring them
money, only for one of them to fall in love with her and the other to
rape her.
That's as complex as the narrative gets, the real focus and enjoyment
of the production is in the way it is told; the body language, the
visual invention, the wit, and the athleticism. And the three actors,
Javier Marzan, Hayley Carmichael, and Paul Hunter give rigorous,
concentrated, meticulously timed performances as they dart about Laura
Jacobs' real caravan set.
Audiences have a hunger for this kind of work and the show was
enthusiastically received last night. But much as the company's
inventiveness and physical skill is admirable, I do find that in the
absence of some greater textual substance, so much self-conscious
quirkiness eventually wears me out.

<HEADLINE>How they would fare in a General Election</HEADLINE>

WHILE we may be two full years from a General Election, Thursday's
council elections, combined with the other all-Scotland elections in
1994 for regional councils and European Parliament seats do offer an
indication of what might happen if the Prime Minister were to call a
snap poll.
What is the likely political make-up of the next Scottish contingent
of MPs?
If we base projections on the existing constituency boundaries and use
the proportions of the vote from Thursdays' results -- excluding the
Independents who feature in local elections but not in General Elections
-- we would see the Conservatives reduced to just one seat, the SNP
gaining three seats to double their representation, the Liberal
Democrats with 10, and Labour taking six seats from the Tories to finish
with 55.
However, the boundaries of a number of parliamentary constituencies
are being redrawn in the run-up to the next General Election, and
although the changes do not alter the overall picture, they are likely,
perhaps in Gordon, to favour the Tories who, given a projection based on
the new boundaries, may pick up two or three seats.
Even given this most optimistic analysis, the Tories are very close to
parliamentary doomsday in Scotland. They could see no better than this
projection even if they improved their vote share from Thursday by 50%.
If the Tories somehow managed to double their vote share between now and
the General Election, the best they could hope for is seven seats.
For the other parties, in parliamentary terms, the results could read
more or less business as usual. The SNP would fail to reach the 30-35%
level required to begin to take seats from Labour and would only
modestly pick up the three Conservative constituencies they challenge in
second place.
In one of these, Perth and Kinross, the forthcoming by-election now
seems an almost certain SNP success.
The Liberal Democrats are still managing to target their support
sufficiently to hold on to their existing parliamentary seats.
Labour would pick up Conservative marginals with ease, given
Thursday's results and may, if next month's local elections in England
and Wales follow a similar pattern as in Scotland for the Conservatives,
be facing the prospect of contributing more than 50 Scottish MPs to a
new Labour Government.

IN a sense, the BBC's Radio 5 Live -- which celebrated its first
anniversary last week -- and the new independent network, Talk Radio UK,
are radio stations with an alarming amount in common.
Both are attempting to create a popular all-speech network with
UK-wide appeal. Both depend heavily on low-cost phone-in formats to fill
their long hours on air. Both depend, too, on ''personality'' presenters
to give their programmes coherence and individuality: on TRUK it's Anna
Raeburn and Caesar the Geezer, on 5 Live Eddie Mair and Sybil Ruscoe,
but the emphasis on presenter ''names'' is the same.
Both also suffer from the same worrying symptom of
resource-starvation, mainly a tendency to field phone-in discussions
with a couple of ''experts'' in the studio, but with no perceptible
back-up in terms of independent information and research; so that the
presenters plunge into subjects like capital punishment or Britain's
relationship with Europe without being able to challenge the callers-in
-- or the experts -- even when the views they express sound like pure,
unsupported prejudice regurgitated fresh from that morning's tabloids.
Radio 5 Live's Diana Madill, for instance, conducted a whole hour's
debate on the death penalty on Wednesday morning without apparently
having access to any information on whether the threat of execution
actually acts as a deterrent or not; and there seems to me something
fundamentally irresponsible about broadcasting on such an emotive
subject without at least providing a few factual reference-points, in
the manner of Radio 4's Call Nick Ross.
But that, broadly speaking, is where the similarity between the two
networks end; for what's surprising -- given the comparability of their
remits, and of the bloke-ish up-market tabloid audience they hope to
attract -- is just how different they are beginning to sound.
TRUK is like a cheeky London talk-station Brit-large, raunchy,
energetic, spontaneous, loud-mouthed, cheerfully ignorant, but pretty
confident in its attitude and tone; it has a quality of easy-going
chumminess with its audience, and of instant response to their
preoccupations that 5 Live cannot begin to emulate.
After midnight on Tuesday, for instance, when 5 Live was plodding
dutifully through some pre-arranged discussion, TRUK's Caesar the Geezer
-- accompanied by veteran disc jockey Dave Cash -- was happily giving
over his programme to a spontaneous two-hour love-in on the subject of
Kenny Everett, who had died earlier that day, his life and broadcasting
times.
''Geezers'' -- as Caesar calls all his listeners -- rang in with
memories, tributes, strange little tapes of Everett in his pirate Radio
London days; old showbiz types rang to reminisce and, of course, to
remind us of their existence; the whole event was as tacky as hell, but
absolutely real and immediate.
Radio 5 Live, on the other hand, is a publicly accountable BBC network
that makes obvious attempts to reflect Britain's regional diversity
(most of its presenters, for instance, have non-London accents and
backgrounds), to make space for small ''built'' programmes and items
(like Euan McIlwraith's Scottish wildlife slot on Wednesday mornings),
to cover neglected news areas like finance and European politics, and to
do justice to its massive responsibilities as the home of BBC radio's
UK-wide sports coverage.
The result is a network that sounds more reliable, kinder, gentler,
and more informative than TRUK; but also far more out of touch, too
virtuous to have its finger truly on the pulse of the naughty, neolithic
tabloid Britain of the 1990s. TRUK doesn't express my culture, in other
words, but it does reflect a culture, a kind of post-modern Essex-man
sensibility -- or lack of it -- whose ugly vitality I can feel every
time I tune in.
Radio 5 Live, by contrast is trying to create a network that will
bridge the gap between that popular culture, and all the other popular
and unpopular cultures of these divided islands. And despite its
respectable first-year listening figures -- mainly sustained by the
indispensable excellence of BBC sports coverage, not to mention David
Mellor's cult post-match football discussion show, 606 -- it seems to me
that the task is proving almost impossible.

YOUR columnist Brian Muck should stop calling Tony Blair Townee Blur.
It is silly, as his fellow travellers Jeremy Haunless, Michael Portaloo,
John Gumboil, and Lord Nebbit would agree.
Brian continues today to equate that pulled Panorama programme with
the right of the douce burghers of Edinburgh to see dirty pictures. Has
he flipped his lid?
He should stick to rugby reporting which he does rather well,
otherwise I shall have to change to a local London cheapo.

SEAN Bean's Sharpe could cut himself and there would always be a
lovely lady to bandage the wound. Someone like deadshot Oirish Ellie,
the commanding officer's niece. She travels to distant Spain in search
of her ''Dada'', and shoots a man in a pitched battle.
Sharpe finds her as a sobbing mass of black hair in need of a tunic to
snuffle into and a few words of soldierly sense.
''Ellie, you proved yourself.''
''No, that's when a women has a child. When she makes a new life . .
.''
''Yes I know . . .''
''But when she takes a life it's wrong! Do you see it's wrong?''
Sharpe sees that it's wrong, but it's a wrong he can right as he
decides to give her a child. Y'know, undress the balance. Sobs turn to
sighs, sighs turn to heaves, corsets crumple, buttons pop, and a fortune
in Napoleonic kit comes off.
Hot lust while the body is not even cold. Few men can arouse such
desire in a woman faster than Sean Bean, the thinking woman's bit of
rough. Not the old lad, or new lad, or post-new-man, but the new
post-man, delivering on all fronts.
Those who've received his deliveries on screen include Joely
Richardson (Lady Chatterley), Theresa Russell (A Woman's Guide To
Adultery), Joanne Whalley-Kilmer (Scarlett), Melanie Griffith (Stormy
Monday). While other Sharpeners include Liz Hurley, Assumpta Serna, and
Louise Germaine.
On Wednesday, Sean Bean returns to the role of Major Sharpe in
Sharpe's Gold, the first in a new series of the acclaimed adaptations of
Bernard Cornwell's novels set during the Napoleonic Wars. The string of
two-hour films has found a loyal and enthusiastic audience attracted by
strong scripts and the bloodshed of battle.
The first one twins Sharpe with the first of three doe-eyed women,
Jayne Ashbourne as Ellie who is seeking her father among the mountainous
territory of a band of Spanish bandits obsessed with sacrifices and
hidden Aztec gold. Dust, lust, and action mingle on the plains as two
hours merrily fly by.
The Boy's Own adventure style of Sharpe, with its male domination, is
beautifully expressed in a throwaway line by Ellie's mother. After
talking to Commander Wellington she says: ''You'll be wanting to get on
with your war so just shove us in a tent or something.''
Then there are the costumes. But before Robin Fraser Paye, the costume
designer, runs down the aisle at the next Bafta Craft Awards to thank
his mum, it's the cast that gives them body. In Sharpe, the girls are
squeezed into early Wonderbras and Sean Bean's buns are kneaded in his
tight britches.
Mind you, he's not shy about unwrapping himself for the cameras and
earning the reputation as the male Greta Scacchi in the process. He's
been quoted as saying: ''I'd rather be an employed sex symbol than an
out-of-work actor.'' And women would agree.
They say it's all about his manner and sense of himself -- ''Oh and
his body and face''. I don't know, chisled jaw, sunken eyes and craggy
nose. Sounds more like rock slide than rock-star looks to me. But Sean
doesn't seem to care. ''I don't mind posing for those kind of pictures
because if you're playing a certain role, that's probably what people
want to see.
''I've had pictures of me in my underpants plastered all over the
papers, but I don't send them in myself and say: 'please print these'.
''If a women is naked then I think the bloke should be too, but only
if it's called for. I haven't got much time for actresses like Sharon
Stone who complain about being exploited on screen. I've done it myself
and I don't feel exploited, it's just my job.''
There are certain parallels between the actor and his current
character. Sharpe was born in a brothel and brought up in the streets.
His meteoric rise to Major was done his way.
Sean Bean was born in Sheffield -- which may or may not have a brothel
-- worked as a welder, porter, and gardener, took drama lessons and
didn't care. With his flies undone, he flashed on stage and got the
giggles during one performance of Deathwatch. He did it his way, and
unluvvie-like, he relaxes with the wife, kids, beer, and football.
In the heat of Napoleonic battle, all Sharpe had to worry about was
the French and certain death. Sean Bean is having to sell his house to
escape marauding hordes. Tabloids recently reported his Muswell Hill
house was up for sale because of too much attention from female fans.
His wife, actress Melanie Hill, who played Aveline in Bread, and their
daughters, two-year-old Molly and six-year-old Lorna, are where Bean's
attention remains firmly fixed. Anyway, he's out of the way of unwanted
attention, filming Goldeneyes, James Bond's welcome-back.
As 006, the rogue agent, Bean seems perfectly cast. Despite all the
nice-guy charm of Sharpe, Bean looks like the bad guy. There was talk of
him replacing Timothy Dalton as Bond but the producers obviously decided
they didn't want Q beaten up, the Aston Martin mashed, and the Bond
babes filing sexual harassment suits.
Bean has a villain's mug, as he demonstrated as the IRA man up against
Harrison Ford in Patriot Games, his last big budget action movie (he
also returned to the squire look in Black Beauty). Perhaps the key
ingredient to his sexual chemistry is his ability to look bad, but worth
the prison sentence.
He would also be a riot with his fellow inmates. It's not just women
who find the whiff of cordite attractive. The success of Sean Bean's
Sharpe is his conviction as a leader of hard men. Tough but fair is
often a euphemism for being as big a swine as you can get away with. But
Bean bends the meaning to never asking your men to do what you would not
do yourself. Sharpe leads from the front, even if at times he tells
little white lies.
In Sharpe's Gold, he tries to pull the comfort blanket over his head
and hide his true self as he warns Ellie and her mum: ''There is danger
you can face up to and danger of another kind. I have smelled it once or
twice. It's rank and wretched and not of this world.'' But the blanket
doesn't cover his eyes which continue to sparkle with menace.
Quite right too! Danger and menace is what we want, and exactly what
the series, Sharpe's Gold, Sharpe's Battle and Sharpe's Sword, seems set
to deliver. The second film, Sharpe's Battle is testament in print to
Bean's bounce. The author Bernard Cromwell was so impressed with our
Sean that he wrote a new book with him in mind. ''I suppose you could
say it's the biggest compliment you could ask for coming from the man
who created Richard Sharpe,'' said Bean.
Still he's a hard man to forget, all that mood, skill, and downright
sex appeal. Ellie responds to her mother's inquiries over their clinch,
saying: ''Oh, Ma, I just needed him then.''
''More than your mother?''
''Yes!''
And what woman would argue?

I WAS surprised to find Brian Meek objecting to the Court of Session
ban on Panorama. Is this not the same Brian Meek who with others sought
interdict at the same court in February 1982 to prevent Lothian Regional
Council publishing an information paper called the Lothian Clarion
shortly before local elections on the ground (inter alia) that it sought
to promote the majority party and disparage the petitioner's party, the
Tory Party? (Meek v Lothian Regional Council. 1983 Scots Law Times,
494.)
Is Mr Meek suggesting that the Prime Minister would not be promoting
Tory policy and disparaging other parties in the interview?
In the Lothian case, Lord Ross granted the interdict, pointing out
that the information in the publication would be just as useful to the
public after the elections when publication would be permitted.
I would suggest the content of Mr Major's interview will be just as
useless to the public after our elections as it would have been before
them.
Our courts have acted sensibly and consistently and for Mr Meek of all
people to suggest otherwise is a display of the most blatant double
standard. But, as I have noted, that of course it is what is expected of
Conservative politicians today.

CENSORSHIP is not the most convincing form of argument. Gagging your
opponent gives the impression that you are afraid to let the public hear
and judge for themselves.
And look what happens when the courts are used to decide what can be
heard or seen: adverts by a trade union against the Government are
permitted because ''they form a generalised attack during elections in
which national political parties are involved''.
But the same judge bans Panorama from showing in Scotland an interview
with the Prime Minister which would also be a generalised political
statement, modified by the fact that it was an interview, not a party
political broadcast, and the interviewer might be trusted to provide
some kind of ''balance''.
Like the trade-union adverts, it could not be seen as part of an
attempt to get a particular candidate elected in Scottish local
elections, so why the inconsistent treatment of the two cases?
There are double standards here. Perhaps The Herald will be less
complacent when the courts begin to decide what newspapers may and may
not print.

SO the interview given by the Prime Minister of Great Britain was
successfully blacked out. It is so typical of the small narrow minds of
the people who aspire today to rule Scotland. These pygmies have created

GOD forgive me, for the first time ever I find myself agreeing with
Brian Meek. He is 100% right when he says the John Major interview on
Panorama should have gone ahead.
Have the opposition parties got no sense? Do they not realise that the
PM is the biggest numpty in politics, a total waste of space, and the
main reason why the Conservatives are going down the sink?
An exposure of some 40 minutes' duration, three days before the
Scottish local elections, would have just about wiped out the last few
Tory votes, started the total collapse nationwide, and heralded the
beginning of a return to compassion and decency.

NO ERRORS, no policy changes, no resignations. That was the view from
the top of the Tory Party in Scotland yesterday as it pondered
humiliation in the local election polls.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang said as much: presentation, development
and communication were the problem, rather than the policies themselves,
he argued, with Euro-rebels at Westminster to blame for causing the
atmosphere of party disunity which had brought the debacle. It was a
line firmly but implausibly held. Mr Lang had to say it, but the context
said otherwise.
''Mouth music'' is a phrase used by journalists when they cover events
where the obvious is trumpeted unconvincingly. Yesterday involved mouth
music through gritted teeth.
The Scottish Secretary, his party chairman Sir Michael Hirst, and the
president of the party's grassroots wing, Mr David McLetchie, all went
through the motions, but the media unfaithful were not convinced.
Their news conference at the George Hotel in Edinburgh was
spectacularly doom-laden. Rarely does a table of three manage to give
out a collective impression of whipped dogs but that was the mood
yesterday. One small exchange broke the gloom.
The correspondent of the Dundee Courier pointed Sir Michael to
comments he made last year to the effect that local government election
results had been ''a poke in the eye for Conservatives.'' On that score,
how would he rate Thursday's results? ''I am not prepared to be more
anatomically specific,'' replied Sir Michael, amid laughter which raised
the gloom only briefly.
The party chairman may have felt the electorate had kicked him
somewhere painful, but Mr Lang was insisting that the Scottish Tory
machine wasn't broken, and so shouldn't be fixed. ''We don't change
policies we believe in,'' he insisted.
However, in a subsequent interview with The Herald Mr Lang made clear
that he feared for the worst unless the Conservative Party south of the
Border buried its differences over Europe. Continued disunity could make
it very dificult for the party to carry on in office, he conceded.
''It's not all down to unity,'' he said, ''but any party that has
disunity can expect to have difficulty getting its policies across. I
have never believed that one should immediately change plans because of
a specific electoral situation.
''Policies are founded in our party's philosophy, in what we believe
in. To change policies is to abandon our principles.''
It was difficult to see how eccentric southern Europhobes in the Tory
Party, up to and including former Glasgow MP turned Southend exile Teddy
Taylor, mattered much on the Scottish doorsteps.
Government policies such as privatisation, including railways and
water, and demands for a Scottish Parliament seemed to be more important
issues.
However, Mr Lang made clear that his strong stance against policy
change applied also to the party's high-profile decision to resist
constitutional change. He denied that gambling on a strong defence of
the Union was a bet which had backfired. ''The Union is fundamental to
our being,'' he said.
''We are the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party. Believing as we
do that devolution is a short step to separation which would be
devastating for Scotland's prospects, it's a black-and-white issue.
''We will get our act together ahead of the next General Election,
certainly sooner than later, I hope. The Labour Party is as deeply
divided on Labour as we are, but we are in government and the focus is
on us. But unless we can get ourselves united we face the prospect of
defeat.''
Mr Lang drew parallels with his political rivals.''Look at the Labour
Party in the 1980s. They were riven by dissension, Healey versus Benn
and so on. The party very nearly took a turn down the left road that
would have meant oblivion. It only takes a relatively small number of
people.''
He added of his own party rebels: ''They must recognise the potential
damage that disunity can cause.''
Mr Lang spoke briefly to Mr Major early yesterday morning. Details of
their discussion on the party's debacle, which left it in control of not
a single one of the 29 new single-tier authorities in Scotland, were not
disclosed. Blaming Euro-rebels seemed to be the agreed line. Policy may
have to be addressed.

Fabric-covered walls are a thing of the past -- and of the future, an
enterprising interior designer tells KENNEDY WILSON. And she's got the
right stuff . . .
IN medieval times castle walls were hung with rich tapestries which
gave the impression of wealth and opulence and also hid the cold, uneven
stone walls behind.
The Victorians also loved to decorate their homes with rich brocades,
tassels and swags. Using fabrics remains an ideal way to feather your
nest. Great interior design effects can be achieved with material --
effects you could never get with humble wallpaper and paint alone.
Patterned or plain drapes, wall hangings or mixed-and-matched scatter
cushions can add something special to any room. Some people dream of
going the whole hog with a tented bedroom ceiling.
One of the most popular home-decorating books of the last couple of
years has been Melanie Paine's Fabric Magic (to be reprinted this year).
Tricia Guild has made a name for herself out of designer soft
furnishings. But the trouble with fabric is that good-quality damask,
silk and even linen and cotton can be expensive, especially when you
want to create a loose-draped effect. Help is at hand.
Joanna Macrae set up her interior design firm, Northwood Designs, 14
years ago, in Dunfermline. She moved that business to Trinity Gask in
Perthshire 11 years ago, and at the end of last year opened a subsidiary
there -- called Out-Lines -- which sells, among other decorative
inspirations, bolts of discontinued designer furnishing fabrics.
At present she has more than 200 rolls in stock -- a total of about
11,000 metres of fabric, she points out -- and her range is always
changing.
And with prices coming down to about one-third of what such material
would cost in the big-name shops for which they were originally
destined, bargains are very much to the fore.
While many reputable department stores buy in sub-standard stock for
their sales, the bargains offered by Out-Lines are fabrics not normally
available to Scots unless they make the pilgrimage to the annual one-day
events held by manufacturers in London.
Out-Lines also sells linings and inter-linings, cushion covers and
remnants in various sizes. There's also an array of fringes and rope.
There is also a range of discontinued wallpaper at very attractive
prices.
''The lines we sell are discontinued ranges of fabrics which are
phased out when the companies launch their new furnishing products,''
says Joanna Macrae. ''People are using more fabrics and are more aware
of using fabrics. Fabric on the walls is also coming in.''
Putting fabric on the walls is not difficult. ''You sew the fabric
together as though you were going to make a curtain, put a padding on
the wall and some timber strips just below the cornice and just above
the skirting then staple the fabric and cover the staples with braid,''
she explains.
''This is very much done in Europe. In France they have put fabric on
the walls for hundreds of years. It creates a wonderfully luxurious,
softer look. And if you have hard floors, which a lot of French houses
do, it deadens the sound. It also covers a multitude of sins if you have
uneven walls.''

Perthshire (tel: 0764 683733). Open: Mon-Fri 9.30am-5pm, Sat 9am-1pm.

THERE is plenty of scope for doing gardening on the cheap. Make up
your own seed and potting compost from sifted soil. Save unused seeds
from one year to the next.
Press the old lawn mower into service for another season. Work with
rusty tools, and adopt countless other ways of saving money.
You still have to ask yourself, is it worth it? Particularly the extra
hassle from tools such as inefficient lawn mowers.
I came to the conclusion the other day, when sharing a watering
between two greenhouses, that I needed another can. Off I went and spent
a few pounds. Now I'm a lot happier with an efficient can adjacent to
the plants that will soon need lots of watering.
Then there is the question of old seeds. Quite a lot will survive,
stored under suitable conditions. As for old fertilisers, which go soggy
and damp in typical domestic conditions, you can't put them through a
sprinkler effectively anyway.
You may adopt the philosophy that you don't need to feed plants,
including lawns. Surely this is false economy. A lawn may be green and
sparkling in spring. It will get pretty woebegone by the end of the
season if you haven't fed it properly meantime.
The same goes for crops like tomatoes if you scrimp on the growing
system. Why skip on growing bags that cost 99p and take three plants? It
won't bust the bank.
Against all this there is still a lot to be said for looking for
bargains. Prices vary. Competition has never been keener on items such
as compost. Don't wait too long, though. If you do you may not get the
right results.

Herald columnists look at the implications and message for Mr Major's
battered party
Michael Fry rakes over the Tory ashes and finds there is sackcloth to
be worn for errors of the past but, if lessons are learned, a spark of
hope for the future
PRESTWICK sums it all up. No town in Scotland has had more loving
Conservative care lavished on it. It was the apple of the eye of
successive Secretaries of State: Lord Rosebery, who got it designated as
the site of an international airport; George Younger, so fond of the
place that he took his noble title from it; Ian Lang, who pays it the
supreme compliment of having his hair cut there.
So Prestwick and what was thought to be its prime economic asset, the
airport, were coddled, cosseted, carried through good times and bad.
Even the advent of a Government committed to the free market made no
immediate difference.
It mattered not a bit that nobody wanted to use the airport, or that,
privileged in its futility, it was holding all Scotland back, from
taking part in the dramatic expansion of international air traffic.
For 10 whole years the Tories ruminated whether to let Scots fly the
Atlantic from Abbotsinch rather than Prestwick -- scarely the reckless
assault on vested interests to which conventional wisdom ascribes the
ruling party's decline. All this the Conservatives did for the sake of
Prestwick. On Thursday, however, Prestwick elected three Labour
councillors.
As, amid the ruins, Tories try to make out what went wrong, it is
natural to reach for the glibbest answer. The answer runs like this,
that any assault on vested interests was a fatal error from the start.
Presumably then, Prestwick, for which we can also read Ravenscraig or
Bathgate or Linwood, should have been kept going. At any rate, as a
general principle only paternal Conservatism could have survived in
Scotland.
The flaw in this argument is that it commits Tories to somebody else's
political programme. For the time being Labour has Scotland completely
wrapped up, through its network of patronage and subsidy at the local
level, and through having been able for 16 years to promise things at
the national level which it did not need to deliver.
In these terms there is no price that Labour would not pay to hold on
to 40 or 50 Scottish parliamentary seats. Neither Conservatives, nor any
other party, can therefore compete with Labour in offering hand-outs. To
offer what Labour offers, only to offer less of it, is hopeless.
It may not seem very helpful advice in such circumstances to say that
the agenda of Scottish politics must be changed. A change in the agenda
will take a long time and require unpopular things to be said, with no
surety of a rapid electoral pay-off. But since nothing else has brought
an electoral pay-off, there can be no harm in starting to think how it
might be done.
The fatal errors of Tory policy since 1979 seem to me to lie in areas
other than those identified by the conventional wisdom. One is that the
administration at St Andrew's House has never rid us of the idea that
Scotland is best served by central bureaucracy.
There has been privatisation, and the sale of council houses, so some
progress towards a property-owning democracy. But overall the State has
scarcely rolled back, and its relationship to civil society is
unchanged; Scots' basic mode of dealing with the Government is to ask it
for money. When the Secretary of State, not to speak of the Prime
Minister, counter the demand for a Scottish Parliament by stressing that
it will reduce our subsidies, they reinforce the mentality which has
brought about their debacle.
What they should do instead, and what they have never done, is try to
induce in Scots a sense of responsibility, a wish to take
responsibility, personal and national. Perhaps there is in the southern
abuse of whingeing Jocks a dim awareness that this ought to be done, but
expressions of it have been counter-productive, to say the least.
There is a different tack. Scotland is one of the more flourishing
parts of the United Kingdom, is in Europe dead on the average for most
things, and is about the 20th richest country in the world. Why should
anybody give us money? It is for Scots to stand on their own feet, to
choose what they want to do and find the resources for it. If subsidies
are to come into the picture, we should be handing them out to the many
people poorer than ourselves.
This line of argument drives me towards the national question, and I
will not shirk it. To me as a Tory, patriotism is one of the most basic
and admirable emotions, and among the few to offer any sure footing in a
modern world constantly dissolving social and economic ties. While in
any other country a Conservative Party in trouble can play a patriotic
card, in Scotland that has become impossible.
But it counts as an intriguing complexity of Scottish life that
patriotism is not nationalism: at least the 74% to have just declined to
vote for the SNP do not think so. Here is ground on which one day
Scottish Conservatism is going to have to reconstruct itself.
While in the light of experience it would be foolish to assume a
smooth transition to Home Rule, the Tories are scarcely any longer in
the position to resist it by themselves, as they did in 1992. They
should be working out how it can be fitted into a new agenda. That means
a Scottish Parliament which stands on its own feet, raises all its own
taxes and makes a just contribution to those wider communities, British
and European, to which Scotland will still belong.

Brian Meek has some advice for the Prime Minister on the
inevitabilities of Scottish politics and the need to recognise them
before it is time to return to the hustings
Dear John,
I am one of the band of 82, the Tories who were elected, the poor
bloody infantry, the cannon fodder for the charge of the light blue
brigade, the last of the few. Our numbers might have been considerably
reduced were it not for local factors.
If I had a pound for everyone who told me they were voting for us
locally, but never again nationally, I would have a big stake for the
National. When we were out canvassing on Tuesday night a man rushed off
to get his camera: ''I just want to have a picture of a Tory councillor
so I can tell the children what they looked like.'' He was not joking.
To say the Government is unpopular is like observing that there is
corruption in Italian public life. The Scots are not all that enamoured
by Townee Blur, they don't give a fig for Mr Paddy and they are starting
to dislike Smart Alex quite seriously -- but they have nothing but pity
for the Conservatives.
A man said to me at the Bonaly Primary School, Thorburn Road: ''I have
just voted for you and I am still wondering why. My mortgage has just
gone up today, my son cannot get a job and, at 54, they are looking to
push me out of my own company for being too old.
''Tell me I am not crazy to support your party.''
Another strain of thought emerged. The Scots hate being patronised.
The Chancellor was up here just a few days ago; it was obvious he had
done not a scrap of homework, he was totally unaware of any local
issues, he told us, in shades of another of his ilk, that we were
''silly billies'' to even think of having our own Parliament.
There is a perfectly good case against devolution, an unanswerable one
to be made against the proposals of the Labour Party, but you and your
Ministers are not making it. To describe 75% of the population, the
people who support a Parliament, as having ''a juvenile idea'' is akin
to writing your own suicide note.
I tell you again that a Scottish Parliament is inevitable, that the
Tories can make a big impact in such a body and that our party will have
to come to terms with that. You can go on ignoring that fact, but you do
so at great risk to the Union. Listen not to the sycophants, read the
election results.
You might be amused to learn, none-the-less that two voters in
Colinton spoiled their papers. They wrote ''Conservative and Unionist --
not Brian Meek'', and I am rather proud of that.
In my view, and that is what I am expected to give, the people of
Scotland rather like you as a man. If they had to choose which party
leader to have dinner with, or lend them a quid, you might well come top
of the poll. But they think you are a bit soft.
Leaders are expected to lead, to inspire, to fire.
When Townee sacked two front-benchers the other day for going off
somewhere without permission, the vast majority of Scots thoroughly
approved. We are used to six of the belt, Pat Lally, David Murray,
Fergus McCann, the culture of the top man calling all the shots.
We do not understand why you tolerate ''the bastards'' in the Cabinet,
the incompetents and the plainly disloyal. We just do not believe John
Selwyn Gummer or Michael Howard. Jeremy Hanley is the kind of English
comic who died at the Glasgow Empire, Jonathan Aitken would not get a
seat on the Rangers' board no matter how many millions he put up.
Can the political situation be turned around in time for the General
Election, will we feel good again, can you, like Desperate Dan, make one
bound and be free? Frankly, I have my doubts.
The Scottish and British public are a fairly forgiving lot, they carry
few grudges and they have genuine sympathy for the underdog. They will,
forever, salute your bravery in tackling the Ulster situation.
What they will not tolerate, however, is sleaze -- the MPs who asked
questions for money should be thrown out of the party -- nor parties who
fight among themselves, who hate each other more than the opposition.
And that very accurately describes the Conservative Party of today.
I am not advocating, John, a new leader -- there is no-one who can
better unite the party. But I am telling you we have a very short time
to convince the electorate that we are fit to be trusted with the reins
of government again.
How would I start? I would inform the whipless wonders, the cretinous
crew of English nationalists, that they have one week to rejoin the
party on your terms or face de-selection immediately. And I would make
Michael Heseltine the party chairman, whether he liked it or not.
I am off now to talk to a Tory group who are going to spend the next
four years in opposition. Unless you want to join us, I suggest you
might like to get the act together.
Yours in the Edinburgh Underground,
Brian.

Herald reporting team: GRAEME SMITH, DAVID ROSS, ROB ROBERTSON and
DAVID STEELE
AS LABOUR euphoria swept across South Ayrshire, and the Tories retired
to lick their wounds, the message was clear that local voters are fed up
with Conservative rule. Labour now holds 21 of the 25 seats and the
Tories four.
For nearly two years Kyle and Carrick, one of the standard-bearers for
Scottish Conservatives in local government, has been rocked by
controversy and the Labour opposition has missed no opportunity to
remind the voters of it.
The district has been regarded by many as a testbed for often
unpopular policies, chiefly in the field of compulsory competitive
tendering, and there has been an often uneasy alliance between the
council and the private sector.
What was seen by many observers as the final nail in the Conservative
coffin was the loss of three leading councillors from Tory ranks over
the tendering process on cleansing and what they saw as the secretive
methods of Provost Gibson MacDonald and his administration.
The pecking order of the new council's Labour administration is still
to be worked out, but as the celebrations continued yesterday the Kyle
and Carrick Labour leader Ian Welsh felt ready to make certain pledges
on behalf of his colleagues.
''Now we can prepare for the future and I can assure everyone who gave
us their support that this will be a compassionate and caring council
which listens to the wishes and aspirations of the community,'' he said.
Ayr Tory MP Phil Gallie warned that the people of South Ayrshire had
condemned themselves to years of higher local taxation and diminishing
services. ''I am deeply disappointed, as are those in my party who have
worked so hard, and I fear for the future of my constituents under a
Labour council.''
STIRLING: Labour drew a winning hand this time round in the council
the Tories had hoped to hold as their flagship. Labour councillors will
outnumber the Conservatives by nearly two to one after capturing 13 of
the 22 seats to the Tories' seven.
This will be the first time in three elections that power will not be
decided on a cut of a pack of cards -- used when the parties are level.
It was also a night for the SNP, as they seized the adjoining
Queensland north and south wards -- traditional Tory heartlands in rural
Perthshire, stretching from Crianlarich in the west, south-eastwards as
far as Doune.
The victories for Mr Ken Campbell and Mr Ian Lambie gave the
Nationalists their first seats in the former Stirling District Council
area since 1977.
HIGHLANDS: the independent tradition of local government will be
passed down to the new 72-member Highland Council when it comes to power
in a year's time.
It will be made up of 49 Independent councillors, nine SNP, seven
Labour, six Liberal Democrat, and one Conservative who will shadow the
existing councils for a year and then take overall responsibility next
spring.
The most prominent among the Independents on Highland region survived
to carry that tradition into the new council. Region convener Duncan
McPherson appeared to be the most vulnerable having won his Black Isle
East seat by just 94 votes at the regional elections in May. His Liberal
Democrat opponent, Mrs Islay MacLeod, was back this week but Mr
McPherson had waged a more aggressive campaign and this time secured a
healthy majority of 391.
The Provost of Inverness, Mr William Fraser, who had campaigned
against the creation of a single Highland council, was defeated by
another Independent, his fellow Inverness district councillor, Mrs
Margaret MacLennan.
In party political terms the SNP was pleased to end up the largest
party grouping with 25% of its candidates winning through, although
yesterday the party was admitting disappointment that only one of the 18
who stood in and around Inverness had made it.
DUMFRIES and GALLOWAY: Labour was jubilant with its performance with
21 winning candidates from 31 fielded. The state of the parties is:
Independents 27; Labour 21; Lib Dems 10, SNP 9, Conservatives 2; and
Others 1.
Labour spokesman Mr Finlay MacRea, who was returned unopposed in
Craigs ward in Dumfries, said: ''We are absolutely delighted. There are
a lot of new faces among the elected councillors as well as some
experienced members. The Tories and SNP have virtually disappeared.''
Labour councillor Tom McAughtrie, who is on the regional council and
won Ryedale ward in Dumfries predicted that the Tories' chosen candidate
to fight the seat in succession to Sir Hector Monro would be defeated.
WEST LOTHIAN: a leading SNP councillor last night admitted to a
tactical blunder over the fight for control of this key central Scotland
council.
Both Labour and the SNP had poured resources into the area which was
seen as one of the most open council battles anywhere in Scotland.
But West Lothian District Council's SNP convener Mr James McGinley
said tactical blunders had been made over selection of candidates.
Councillor McGinley, who won his St Ninian's seat, said he had
expected his party to win at least 14 seats and gain power. Instead it
won only 11 with Labour gaining control with 15 seats. One Conservative
councillor was voted in.
BORDERS: Independents will dominate the administration holding 29 of
the 58 seats, almost double the 15 Liberal Democrats who will lose
power-sharing in the coalition that has been operating on the existing
regional council.
There are likely to be recriminations among Liberal Democrats about
the number of party members and supporters who stood as Independents.
Among the successful Independents was the election agent of Liberal
Democrat MP Sir David Steel, Mr Riddle Dumble of Galashiels.l
The Tories now have only three seats despite fielding 27 candidates.
They saw a particularly disastrous nosedive in Berwickshire, where they
are the controlling group on the present district council, failing to
win a single seat.
ABERDEEN is tipped to have a Lady Provost -- Councillor Margaret
Farquhar who stands to receive recognition for a quarter of a century of
dedication to the city's Northfield area.
The 65-year-old Labour policy convener on Aberdeen district had
planned to retire but was persuaded to continue in politics to fight the
Granitehill ward where her personal vote was required to beat off a
strong attack by the SNP's Maureen Watt.
As Labour swept to power in the city with 30 of the 50 seats she took
the ward with a majority of 205 and said that if asked to be provost,
she would accept.

A YOUNG mother and first-time Scottish National Party candidate was
sitting at home yesterday nursing the most prized unionist scalp of all
from the elections.
Mrs Kathryn Higgins, 27, dispossesed the Earl of Stair's family of a
council seat in Galloway for the first time in more than 40 years, but
the landmark reaches beyond twentieth-century political history.
In unseating Davina, Countess of Stair -- cousin to the Queen and the
wife of John Dalrymple the 13th Earl of Stair who stood as an
Independent -- Mrs Higgins scored a historic victory against a family
viewed with hatred by many nationalists for the past 300 years.
James Dalrymple of Wigtownshire was one of Scotland's leading
seventeenth-century jurists, a commissioner for the administration of
justice under Oliver Cromwell and a strong supporter of the 1688
Revolution rewarded for his loyalty to the English crown in 1690 by
being created the 1st Viscount of Stair.
His son, the 1st Earl of Stair, was Lord Advocate at the time of the
Massacre of Glencoe for which he was held largely responsible, and a
strong supporter of the Treaty and Act of Union in 1706-7.
The Stair family have remained loyal to the Union since that time and
immersed in local politics through Wigtownshire County Council and
recently Wigtown District Council.
Mrs Higgins, a business honours graduate and legal trainee, followed
in her father, Mr Robert Higgins's footsteps -- he is the SNP councillor
for the neighbouring Ryan ward -- by standing as a candidate on
Thursday.
With a 54% turnout, she turned her own family dynasty to advantage and
is now an SNP councillor on the new Dumfries and Galloway Council at the
expense of the unionist aristocrat.
''When I heard she (Lady Stair) was standing, I decided the area
should be offered an alternative sort of candidate,'' Mrs Higgins said.
''Davina Stair was very gracious after the result was declared, but on
the doorstep it was local and social issues that beat her.
''Half of the ward electors are council tenants, and there were
immense concerns over care in the community, education and nursery
provision. These are issues which people needed a strong and concerned
Scottish voice.
''I suppose my victory is quite politically and historically
significant,'' she added, ''but I owe a lot of my success to the strong
SNP support my father built up in part of my ward.''
Last night the SNP's chief executive, Mr Mike Russell, congratulated
Mrs Higgins on her ''historic achievement'', adding: ''We are now
beginning to right some of the wrongs of Scottish history.''
Next Wednesday, Mrs Higgins will join a cross-party seminar when the
SNP's nine councillors will decide whether to support Labour (21
councillors) or the Independents (28 councillors) to form a ruling
coalition on the new 70-seat council.
''Either way I'll probably end up sitting next to my dad,'' added the
surprise victor.

Ian Walls sifts through the catalogues and decides how he'll fill his
borders this year
AFTER much deliberation on what to go for in the colour department
this year, I've decided to put my efforts into a mixture of half hardy
and hardy annuals.
This is as opposed to the cottage-type approach with permanent
plantings of shrubs and room in between for annuals.
Looking through the catalogues, and remembering the superb results
last year, I decided I couldn't go past the annuals.
Annuals are easy to choose, in their gaily coloured packets. Pictures
are remarkably representative of what you actually get -- if all goes
well.
Whatever you do, plan annual borders with care. For half hardies, I
have stuck with alyssum, lobelia, geranium, impatiens (busy Lizzie),
begonia, French marigold, nemesia, and dahlias.
My seeds are sown, but there is time for you to catch up.
Alternatively, you can buy in young plants and save all the hassle. You
may even decide to give half hardy annuals a miss and just buy them in
as plants ready for setting out in May.
It is worth noting that some plants treated as half hardy annuals --
including impatiens, begonia, and geraniums -- are in fact half hardy
perennials.
Once you have them established you can keep them from year to year, if
you faithfully lift them indoors before they are cut down by frost.
As for hardy annuals, which I intend to sow direct from mid-April
onwards, I have been faithfully through Suttons catalogue and picked out
a range of small, medium, and tall plants.
This includes some everlastings such as catananche, helichrysum,
statice, and xeranthemum. Growing these keeps my wife happy. You can
take colour into the winter with them.
It is really exciting looking through all the hardy annuals you can
grow, so easily, from direct seeding.
There is one proviso. Should the weather in April prevent sowing out,
you may have to resort to sowing in pots or trays in a cold greenhouse.
Then plant out in May.
You may also need to water beds to hasten germination if dry sunny
weather sets in. If so, do it with a quality sprinkler that gives small
droplets. Otherwise you can do more harm than good.
The late John Warwick used to say, when I was a student at
Auchincruive, the best thing was to stamp on the bed with big feet and
rake it down so that the ground is very firm and holds moisture.
He liked sowing in shallow drills rather than simply broadcasting. I
must admit I prefer the latter way, particularly if I take the time to
riddle fine soil over the seed and firm it down with the back of a
spade.
Whatever you are doing, remember the labels. Nothing is worse than not
being able to tell what the plants are.
MILLIONS of seeds of all types are being sown right now. Only a few
may ever produce edible or ornamental plants. There are many reasons.
One is that small seeds, for flowers such as lobelia and alyssum, can
create a gross surplus. The same applies to outdoor vegetables, with
drastic thinning out needed.
Two, a lot of seed does not germinate or dies off prematurely. Reasons
include unsuitable compost and poor weather. Cold, wet, and dry
conditions all have a part to play.
The main cause of premature death is invariably intermittent dryness,
yet the reverse can also be true.
Young seedlings can be attacked by fungal diseases to cause damping
off. This can be partly prevented with Cheshunt compound, but nothing
can compensate for irregular growing conditions.
Item three is simply bad seed. It is a rarity nowadays but it can
happen. If companies feel germination may be impaired, they often put in
extra seed in a packet, with an explanatory note.
All seeds have a lifespan. A lot depends on how seed is stored after
harvesting. Many gardeners save seed, which is fine if it is stored in
airtight tins in reasonably cool conditions.
Producing vegetables indoors -- for planting out -- can be relatively
simple. This applies to the cabbage family, onions, leeks, lettuce, and
quite a few more.
If you have trouble with peas and beans you can always sow in peat
pots in a cool greenhouse and bring them on for planting out later.

THE SCALE of Labour's stunning victory in Glasgow surprised even its
own supporters.
Even the most optimistic were expecting to win about 70 of the 83
seats on the new City of Glasgow Council. It will be a shadow authority
till April next year when it will assume full powers.
In the event, Labour took 77 seats, which, despite the euphoria
pervading the City Chambers yesterday, may not be as beneficial as it
sounds, given the fierce factional rivalry that has riven the current
district council Labour group.
The much-bloodied Conservatives still will be the official opposition,
although they have been reduced from four to three. The group comprises
long-standing members Councillor William Aitken and Bailie John Young,
who retained their Kelvindale and Cathcart seats by the skins of their
teeth.
They are joined by a former regional councillor, Mrs Catherine Lyon,
who had a sound victory over Labour, Liberal Democrats and the SNP at
Maxwell Park.
Scottish Militant Labour was confident of replacing the Conservatives
as the official opposition. Instead it took a drubbing, losing three of
its four current members of the district council -- James McVicar at
Baillieston, Charles Stevenson at Queenslie, and Nicky Bennet at
Levernholm. Sole survivor was the leader, Tommy Sheridan. He won well at
Pollok.
At the count in Glasgow's SECC, Councillor Sheridan had to endure
ironic chanting of ''There's only one Tommy Sheridan,'' from
unsympathetic Labour supporters keen to emphasise his solitary position
on the new council.
Other Militant candidates had mixed fortunes, but the performance was
surprisingly poor in the greater Easterhouse area where some candidates
polled very low votes.
The much-vaunted SNP threat failed to materialise and its
representation was cut from two seats to one.
However, the majority of the SNP's Kenny Gibson at Mosspark, 2123, was
the highest in the city.
The Scottish Liberal Democrats took only one seat. Nevertheless, the
winning candidate, the erudite Dr Christopher Mason, could well dominate
council debates as he currently does at Strathclyde Regional Council.
Beneath the euphoria evinced by Labour members at the City Chambers
was intense speculation as to who will win the struggle for power in the
new authority.
Supporters of Labour leader, Councillor Patrick Lally, and those of
his great rival, former leader, Councillor Jean McFadden, have both been
in contact prior to the election, with regional council Labour leader,
Councillor Robert Gould.
He brings 17 of his regional colleagues to the new council and is keen
to be leader of the new authority's Labour administration, with
Councillor Lally equally keen to be Lord Provost.
However, it could be that Councillor Gould and Councillor McFadden
will face a third contender for the leadership, Bailie Gordon
MacDiarmid, the current deputy leader of the district council Labour
group.
One informed source said: ''Now that the election is over, the real
fight can begin.''

George Hume reports how a Highland incomer has decided to challenge
the political incorrectness of the term 'white settler'
AN INCOMER who moved to the Highlands for the fishing has done the
modern equivalent of seizing a claymore out of the thatch after being
outraged by the label ''white settler''. Retired businessman Bruce
Henderson has reported the alleged insult to the Commission for Racial
Equality.
The label he complains about appeared in the annual report of a
charity which has the Duke of Edinburgh as its patron. Mr Henderson, a
Dundonian who moved to Glenurquhart six years ago, has also called on
the charity, The Highland Fund -- based in Glasgow -- to pulp the annual
report and order a re-print without the ''white settler'' description.
Mr Henderson said yesterday: ''I think the phrase 'white settler' is
racist. If the author of the article had written in the Birmingham Post
of 'black settlers' or in the Leicester Gazette -- or whatever they call
it -- that there were 'brown settlers', I think he would have been
pushed a bit by someone. But here it seems to be accepted.''
The Highland Fund, which operates on a part-time basis and helps to
arrange low-interest loans for people in the Highlands, is largely
unmoved by Mr Henderson's resort to the Commission for Racial Equality,
and does not intend to order a re-print of the report.
The commission, likewise, did not go into overdrive when it received
Mr Henderson's complaint. A spokesman said: ''The term 'white settler'
might be offensive, but we are not an arbiter of what is acceptable
language unless it is specifically related to a case of
discrimination.''
Highland Fund chairman Calum Bannerman says Mr Henderson's is the only
complaint received about the ''white settler'' remark. The Highland
Fund, he said, had no intention of being racist, and he apologised to
anyone who might have been offended.
The author of the article, Dr Ewen Cameron, a lecturer in Scottish
history at Edinburgh University, was yesterday absent from his word
processor and could not be contacted. His article examines the effect
incomers have on housing, holiday homes, Highland values and culture. A
paragraph states that although ''white settlers'' attract hostility in
the Highlands, feeling against them has not reached the proportions it
has in Wales, where holiday homes owned by outsiders have been torched.
Mr Henderson, 66, says: ''The use of the term 'white settler' is
absolutely disgraceful. The fund's annual report should be re-printed
minus the phrase. The alternative, 'people who move into the area',
should be used instead.
''I have been coming here for years, the last two weeks each June, for
the fishing. Then, six years ago, I saw a sign 'plot for sale'. I had
already had a good day's fishing and that made it a perfect day. I
bought the plot and we had a house built on it so that I can fish. I am
very happy here. There is not a great deal to do in the winter, so I
write letters to politicians.
''In this PC age I thought the term 'white' was all wrong, but it
would be incorrect to say I am upset. I have not been upset since
1954.'' Mr Henderson would not reveal what had caused him to be upset 41
years ago when he was aged 25.
At the headquarters of Highlands and Islands Enterprise -- which takes
an advert in The Highland Fund annual report -- the press officer,
Jonathon Poore, an incomer, was nonplussed by Mr Henderson's fury.
''We take no view at all on white settlers. Two words neither
categorise The Highland Fund's annual report as racist nor impugn anyone
who comes to live in the Highlands. The term is rather misleading, but
there is no strong feeling.''
The Duke of Edinburgh, patron of The Highland Fund since 1963, like Mr
Henderson, enjoys fishing and does so at his family's holiday home at
Balmoral, which he visits annually from his wife's properties in London,
Windsor and Norfolk.
Penny Russell-Smith, the Duke's press secretary at Buckingham Palace,
yesterday pondered Prince Philip's position vis-a-vis the Commission for
Racial Equality in the light of Mr Henderson's complaint. She said:
''The Duke of Edinburgh has not seen this report -- indeed, he appears
not to have received any annual reports from The Highland Fund since
1990 -- and in the light of that we would not like to issue a
statement.''
* FISH-NOTE: Mr Henderson's best Highland catch to date -- an eight
pound trout from Loch Ness.

Today's afficionados of the
countryside can thank caring
citizens of the last century
for their freedom to roam,
as Peter Evans discovers
USE of Scotland's countryside for recreation is growing fast, with
walkers, climbers, mountain bikers, and others all seeking peace, quiet,
and excitement in the great outdoors. Many believe they have a right to
be there, but in the case of most of the country's wide-open spaces, it
is only a moral right, with no basis in law.
The exception is Scotland's network of rights of way, which do have a
legal status. Credit for establishing it must go to a body which this
year celebrates 150 years of working to maintain access to this giant
leisure resource -- the Scottish Rights of Way Society. The society has
its roots in Edinburgh, where a civic reception, hosted by the district
council, was held on Tuesday at the City Chambers to launch the
anniversary.
In 1845, many Edinburgh citizens were concerned about the loss of
public access to some popular walking places near the city, such as
Corstorphine Hill and Roslin Glen. A public meeting was called by Lord
Provost Adam Black, and it was agreed to form an association to protect
''public rights of roadway'' in and around the capital.
Despite several changes of name, the society's aims and objectives
have remained unaltered down the years. It lays claim to being the
oldest body of its kind in Britain dedicated to promoting walking in the
countryside.
After taking up the cudgels on behalf of the good people of Edinburgh,
the newly formed body began to spread its wings. In 1847 it became
involved in probably its most legendary case, featuring Edinburgh
University botany professor John Balfour -- the designer of the city's
botanic gardens.
In the middle of the nineteenth century, the rise of wealthy
landowners and their great sporting estates was in full swing, and some
set out to deny access to traditional drovers' routes through the glens.
Balfour was in the habit of taking his students on field excursions to
all parts of Scotland, and on an outing in August, 1847, with seven
students, he was confronted by the Duke of Athole (now Atholl) and his
gillies.
A heated argument broke out, in which the duke tried to force Balfour
and the students to return to Braemar by the way they had come. However,
the party escaped over a wall and fled from the scene, the duke's
gillies in hot pursuit.
A long lawsuit followed, with the rights of way society -- then still
called an association -- winning a marked victory. A legal precedent was
set, establishing the public's right to raise an action over the status
of a right of way.
HOWEVER, it was far from plain sailing in those early decades, and in
1883 costs of #650 in another protracted legal wrangle, this time over
access to Glen Doll estate, almost bankrupted the society. It was some
consolation that the landowner, one Duncan Macpherson, who had bought
the estate after making his fortune in Australia and tried to make it an
exclusive preserve for stalking, had to pay expenses of around #5000 --
an extremely large sum in those days.
For a long time afterwards, landowners were reluctant to contest
public rights of passage along ancient routes through the hills and
glens. The costs of the Glen Doll case led directly to the society's
sponsorship of a Right of Way Bill in Parliament. It resulted, through
the Local Government (Scotland) Act of 1894, in local authorities being
made responsible for rights of way and keeping them free from
obstruction -- a burden the authorities still bear.
Although co-operation between the society and local authorities has
not always been close, liaison has improved in recent years, with good
results. In 1993, for example, the present Duke of Atholl denied the
right of way status of the seventeenth-century Minigaig Pass, running
through wild country north from Blair Atholl to Kingussie.
Perth and Kinross District Council and the society gathered
considerable evidence to substantiate public use of the route -- one of
the factors necessary to confirm a right of way. The Minigaig was
subsequently so declared.
But from the first rights of way battles, especially the Glen Doll
case, which brought the society to its financial knees, it has been
acknowledged that the legal settlement of disputes is complex, costly,
and time-consuming. Consequently, many cases that might otherwise have
been contested have gone by default with rights of way lost.
As early as 1894, the society's board called for a simpler and cheaper
process for settling disputes -- a call reiterated in a paper produced
by the society in 1990, claiming the present law is unclear and archaic.
James Bryce, one of three MPs on the 1894 board, went further than
campaigning just for rights of way as a means of access to the
countryside. Bryce wanted general freedom of access to the mountains,
and a century later this ''freedom to roam'' principle, as it has become
known, is still a focus of contention.
The Scottish Rights of Way Society is not without its critics on this
front. Foremost among them is writer and broadcaster Rennie McOwan, a
former society director, who argues vehemently that rights of way are
''corridors'' that give landowners the excuse to restrict walkers to
them. McOwan has declared the society to be an anachronism in most
modern circumstances, preferring to espouse the freedom-to-roam
principle, provided that freedom is exercised responsibly.
''My inheritance is not confined to a handful of legal routes,'' he
says. ''If every path in Scotland which looked like having a right of
way status was given that status tomorrow, it would only be a fraction
of the access needed.''
OTHERS of less extreme opinion do not see rights of way and freedom to
roam as mutually exclusive. In the society's own view, the total answer
to the problem of providing public access to the countryside has three
components:
* A network of low-level footpaths across agricultural land and near
urban settlements for people to enjoy short walks.
* A rights of way network providing a legal right to walk more widely
in the countryside, across hills and mountains.
* A presumed (but not necessarily legalised) freedom to roam over open
moorland, hills, and mountains, provided it is exercised with due regard
to those who live and work in these areas.
The society says: ''It is our view that rights of way in Scotland are
a very important part of the social heritage which has been passed to us
from those who, centuries ago, lived and worked in the countryside.
Without rights of way, and the successful contesting of cases such as
Glen Tilt and Glen Doll, it is quite likely that landowners 100 years
ago would have been able to prevent access to Scotland's glens and
mountains.
''As it is, the rights of way that were defended in the last century
have been the keys that have unlocked, and kept unlocked, the
countryside for the public.''
Even the fiercest critics would have to agree that the society has
played a vital role in the history of recreational access in Scotland:
but no-one with an interest is in any doubt that the debate will
continue.

THERE'S a new ride-on mower from the US, just launched on the UK
market.
It's from the Toro people, comes with a 15.5hp motor, and claims to
reduce mowing time by up to 38%. There is a dual-action pedal for the
heavy-duty hydrostatic engine. And that makes it a hands-on operation.
Recycler technology cuts and recuts grass into small slivers. These
are then injected back into the soil. That should act as a natural
fertiliser at no extra cost. The 15-44HXL is all yours for a modest
#2499. There's an even bigger one too, at a mere #3399.
Meanwhile a new hover mower from Qualcast will suit younger first-time
buyers. The Contura breaks new ground in its sector with a 12in metal
plate, ideal for smaller lawns or uneven banks.
Atco has a new 19in petrol rotary mower called Viscount, and a new
hedge cutter with a 17-19in blade.

A COMMITTEE of 38 local Labour Party activists will meet in Edinburgh
tomorrow to decide who should hold the top jobs in the new single-tier
city council.
Labour won an overall majority of 10 seats on the 58-seat council. The
contest for power is very much a region versus district affair.
The Temporary Local Government Committee formed specially to deal with
matters arising from the reorganisation will recommend who should chair
the new shadow authority and who should lead the Labour administration.
Both Lothian Region's Labour leader Keith Geddes and Edinburgh
District Council's leader Lesley Hinds would like the job.
Lothian Region convener Eric Milligan is being tipped for the post of
chairman. He would then expect and hope to be confirmed as Lord Provost
in a year's time.
The city party activists' recommendations will be considered by a
meeting of the new Labour group on Tuesday and on past precedent will
probably be accepted.
They will have to strike an electoral balancing act between being seen
to favour the present district group or the regional one. Otherwise a
harmonious merger of the two groups will be seriously jeopardised.
Along with Councillor Geddes and Councillor Hinds, the present
regional education chairwoman Elizabeth Maginnis has been mentioned as a
possible contender for the leadership of the new council.
The party activists will also have to recommend a new group secretary
as the man who would probably have held that vital post, regional
councillor Paul Nolan, lost in Duddingston to Tory district councillor
Ian Berry.
The new council is set to hold its first meeting next Thursday in the
City Chambers when it will elect its chairman and probably a policy and
resources committee. One of its first priorities in the next few weeks
will be to select a chief executive.
The Opposition Tories on the new council, who hold 14 seats, yesterday
unanimously elected the present leader of the district council group,
Daphne Sleigh, as their new leader. District Councillor Brian Meek will
be group chairman.
Councillor Donald Gorrie is expected to lead the group of 10 Liberal
Democrats but that decision will not be taken until next week.
Meanwhile, the Scottish Office has announced the allocation between
the 29 new councils of the #36m grant made to cover their costs during
this shadow year.
These include paying councillors' allowances, staff recruitment and
the salaries of management teams. The largest council, Glasgow, is to
get #2.9m, and Edinburgh almost #2.2m. The smallest, Clackmannan, gets
#703,000.

Ian Walls keeps you busy in the garden . . . and the toolshed
ONE of the most fiddly jobs in the garden is pricking off young
seedlings, hopefully sown in greenhouse or on the window sill over the
past few weeks.
Professional growers have machines to do the job mechanically. Alas,
gardeners are still left with the pernickety task of separating out the
seedlings and putting them individually -- or in small groups in the
case of lobelia -- into trays. In some instances it may be into
individual pots.
You can get small dibbers, or use a pen. Even your fingers. The
important thing is to handle seedlings with great care. They are easily
damaged.
They must not be pulled rudely out of the seed compost. Otherwise, you
tear off the vital root. You end up with a seedling that has only a
50-50 chance of survival.
You have to space them out sufficiently, so that they can grow on
without congestion well into May. That is when you plant them outdoors.
Not a lot of heat is needed once pricking out is done. Commercial
growers keep very cool conditions. The thing is to avoid frost damage
overnight. Try a thermostatically-controlled unit.
Aim for around 42[DEG]-43[DEG]F to keep frost at bay. If you grow
seedlings on too briskly they will end up floppy and soft. That just
about rules out window-sill gardening. The home is generally far too
warm. Out of doors, the main priority is forking over land between
shrubs or roses, or preparing for bedding out. Digging is more
applicable in the latter case, going down to a good depth.
Incorporate any supplies you may have of well-rotted compost or
farmyard manure.
I was at allotments in Greenock the other day and noticed that many
people stick with FYM. It looked to be pretty mature stuff.
It can be a fallacy to use fresh manure. It is sure to contain lots of
seeds. I once brought in some very noxious weeds using improperly
matured material.
Another job that requires attention is trimming hedges, catching them
before they get into full stride. I must remember to try Cutlass, as a
hedge setter, to see if this reduces vigour. A word of warning: use
material strictly as recommended.
Finally, get into the toolshed. Tidy up in preparation for the season
rather than fall over things later. It's one of those jobs that the less
you think about it the better you can get on with it.

THE Prime Minister was facing ''a triple whammy,'' SNP leader Alex
Salmond forecast yesterday.
Conservative candidates had been thumped in the Scottish local
elections and looked certain to be hammered in the English local polls
next month. After that, the party faced disaster in the Perth and
Kinross parliamentary by-election.
This succession of political defeats would keep Mr Major in ''a
permanent state of political crisis,'' Mr Salmond said. If Tory Central
Office was trying to get rid of him, it could not have gone about it in
a better way.
He said that the scale of the SNP's success in taking control of the
new Perth and Kinross Council -- the present district is run by the
Tories -- had exceeded expectations
''On these results, there is no doubt that we are set for victory in
the by-election whenever the Tories have the courage to face the
electorate.''
In the new 32-seat council, the SNP has an outright majority with 18
seats There are only two Tory members.
The SNP leader also claimed that the local polls had produced the
best-ever election result for the party. It had even exceeded the record
set in 1977 of 170 seats.
Instead of outright control of only one district council in Angus, the
party now ran three of the new authorities -- Angus, Moray and Perth and
Kinross, he said.
In total, it had won 27% of the vote and had emerged as the second
largest party in Scottish local government. Mr Salmond said that
Scottish politics now was a two-horse race between the SNP and Labour.
Asked if the SNP was disappointed not to have made a breakthrough by
winning any council in the Central Belt from Labour, Mr Salmond insisted
that no party won control by suddenly coming from nowhere but had to
build up support gradually.
Pressed on why the SNP had failed to secure any seats in the new
Edinburgh City council and had only one member on the new Glasgow
authority, he said the Liberal Democrats would claim such a situation
meant they were victims of the electoral system.
In fact, the SNP had won as many votes as the Liberal Democrats in
Edinburgh, yet it had finished with no seats and the Liberal Democrats
with 10.
Claiming other successes, SNP chief executive Mike Russell said the
party had beaten two Tories in Stirling to win its first seats there for
20 years. It had beaten Labour in Linlithgow and Dumbarton and was
running neck and neck with Labour in areas like Livingston and
Kilmarknock and Loudoun.
Gains were made from Labour in Midlothian, East Ayrshire and Renfrew.
In the Highlands, the SNP had broken through to become the largest
political party in the Independent-run council.

JOHN Major's drubbing in the local elections in Scotland may be
nothing compared to what he is facing in England and Wales on May 4. The
message from Scotland has always been clear -- the Conservatives are
deeply unpopular and Scots will vote for almost anyone else.
In England and Wales, the situation has been rather more blurred --
partly because of the threat from the Liberal Democrats and partly
because the Tories always have had such strengh in the south of the
country.
All of this may be about to change, but it may not mean that the
Tories will lose the next General Election. The betting at the moment is
that while the Government is deeply unpolular, it may just do enough
between now and the summer of 1997 to save itself.
This, admittedly, is a curious perspective, but it has the virtue of
previously having been proved right.
The Tories, particulary under Margaret Thatcher, have a history of
disastrous local election and by-election results and then coming back
to do well when it really matters.
Mr Major has made a virtue out of necessity in trying to defend his
corner on local government policies, pointing out how well Conservative
councils -- Wandsworth and Westminster are the key examples -- run the
show, but it is impossible in this situation to separate the local from
the national.
The key to what is about to happen in England and Wales is that the
electorate is fed up with the Tory Government and, regardless of the
record of the Conservatives at local level, they will be dumped.
It is a national referendum on a deeply unpopular Governent and it
simply will build on the results in Scotland in telling us a bit more
about the public mood.
What, however, will be very interesting will be how well the Liberal
Democrats perform in comparison with the Labour Party.
A very good performance by the Liberal Democrats may, ironically, be
good news for the Tories, because it will demonstrate that the voters
are merely registering a protest and may well drift back into the Tory
fold when we really get down to the wire of a General Election.
However, a strong performance by Labour will be extremely worrying for
the Tories because it will indicate that the mood of the electorate is
that they should go and go now, and that Mr Blair is the coming man.
Up for grabs are a total of 10,595 seats, including the shadow
elections for unitary authorities in Wales, one third of the seats in
the English metropolitan districts, and some bits and pieces in the
shires.
However, the Tories have little left to lose except their credibility.
They have majority control in Trafford in Greater Manchester, have a
deal with the Liberal Democrats in Walsall and are the largest party in
Solihull, which gives them effective control, but only on an ad hoc
basis.
The Tories still are suffering from the dreadful fall-out from the
poll tax. The council tax is marginally more popular but they will never
be forgiven for the mess the poll tax produced, and it is perhaps
forgotten that all of us still are paying for its bureaucratic
nightmare.
Try as they might to concentrate the minds of the electorate south of
the Border on local issues, the verdict will be delivered on national
matters. On either count, the Tories are currently in deep trouble, but
nonetheless they will be worth watching when the big show comes to town
in two years' time.

WHAT do Zeus, Noah, Para Handy, and the Clyde River Purification Board
have in common? All are connected with the story of the kingfisher. In
Scotland, this incredible bird has begun to make a comeback on the White
Cart and the Kelvin, and you can look for it with confidence at Cora
Linn by New Lanark for the first time since Robert Owen's day.
This is thanks to the cleaning-up of the Clyde Valley waters. Fifty or
so pairs of kingfishers now breed along the streams of the central
Lowlands. You will see them streaking past or perched above still water.
After a shallow dive they club minnows and sticklebacks on a branch and
swallow them headfirst, only turning them round to present to their
mates -- as we do with knives. Inevitably, no bird suffers so much from
prolonged frost.
Kingfishers are so bright, so small, so quick, that you can't believe
you've seen one. Andrew Marvell caught the way their image lingers after
them:
''The viscous air, whereso'e'r she fly,
Follows and sucks her azure dye;
The jellying stream compacts below.
If it might fix her shadow so . . .
And men the silent scene assist,
Charmed with the sapphire winged mist.''
The charms and myths they trail all speak of colour. Noah released a
kingfisher from the ark to search for land. It flew so high that it took
the blue from the sky and the sun burned its breast red. For this it was
made to perch on the roof of the ark and fish for itself. The classical
legend ends with lovers turned into kingfishers who nest in seven calm
days at the winter solstice -- the Halcyon days.
Kingfishers' bodies could ward off Zeus's lightning, and their plumage
continued to change colour after their death. What was this blink of
immortality called? You've guessed it: the Vital Spark.

Kirsty Scott reports on the aftermath at Eastwood, where Tory hopes
for a council stronghold went badly wrong
ANNE saw it coming, even if Maude didn't. Emerging from the polling
station at Eastwood recreation centre on Thursday, the two friends
couldn't agree on the likely outcome of the election.
''In this district, the Conservatives will get in without too much
trouble,'' said Maude, 77.''No, no, no, no,'' said Anne, 75, wagging her
finger forcefully. ''Not necessarily.''
Of all the new councils, East Renfrewshire allegedly had been cut for
the perfect Tory fit, but Anne was right and the party couldn't quite
squeeze itself into it when it came to the crunch.
It may yet win control of the administration but faces days, if not
weeks of waiting or nerve-wracking negotiation.
The final tally was nine seats to the Conservatives, eight to Labour,
one to Independent Ian Pearce and two to the Scottish Liberal Democrats.
The wooing has already begun in earnest, and Mr Pearce, who describes
himself as a decidedly unpolitical animal, admits to being overwhelmed
and distinctly uncomfortable about his new position. ''I'm not sure yet
whether I will align or not,'' he said yesterday.
Labour is said to be going for the backing of the two Scottish Liberal
Democrat candidates, but it is understood that one Labour councillor has
already tried to call Mr Pearce.
The Labour leader of Renfrew District Council, Mr Owen Taylor, who is
one of the Labour eight on the new authority, said the new team would be
sitting down to talk about its position over the next few days.
''I'm elated. We were supposed to have a safe Tory council in East
Renfrewshire and the public has seen through this. Their plans have
turned to dust in their hands,'' he said.
There were no councillors in the offices of the Tory-run Eastwood
District Council yesterday. Among the leaflets stacked neatly at
reception were bundles of Scottish Office fliers outlining the details
of the local government reorganisation.
Speaking later, Eastwood's Tory group leader, Mr Gordon MacDonald,
said the new Conservative councillors for East Renfrewshire would be
meeting ''very shortly'' to discuss the way forward, but would not
comment further.
According to the political pundits, it was never supposed to happen
like this. Analysts predicted that those who sketched out the boundary
lines for the new authorities had drawn a safe Tory community in East
Renfrewshire.
It includes the Conservative heartland of Eastwood with five
appliqued-on seats from Barrhead, Neilston and Uplawmoor -- like a staid
Tory matron with somewhat inappropriate accessories.
While other authority boundaries enjoyed a brief definition at most in
the Government blueprint, East Renfrewshire required 49 lines to
describe the parameters of the new administration. It was nicknamed
''Stewarty'' after Conservative MP Allan Stewart, hovering, as it does,
around his Eastwood constituency.
In sum, it is largely sensibly-shod suburbia in its purest form;
owner-occupied, spattered with small stores selling Italian light
fixtures not lightbulbs, Perrier, not Irn-Bru. The kind of place where
estate agents will only do a double-take if the sale price is under six
figures.
Down in the staunchly Labour main street of Barrhead, delighted
residents, who had fought against being grafted on to the neighbouring
community, said they were confident Labour would now win control.
''I did think the Tories might have clinched it, but I was hoping they
wouldn't'' said Mrs Jean Kelly, braving the wind that ripped down the
centre of the main thoroughfare. ''To be honest, I felt as if we had
been sold down the river before the election. I'm pleased, I think most
people here are.''
''Barrhead's Labour, always has been, always should be, probably
always will be,'' said one man, jogging briskly past.
On election day itself, the electorate was not quite so confident. At
the Carlibar Primary School polling station on Thursday, Frank and
Margaret Small emerged grim-faced after casting their votes for the
Labour candidiate.
''I hope it's Labour tomorrow but they've put us in with the Tories
and you just can't tell,'' said Frank. ''Barrhead is Labour, always has
been, nothing but Labour. The mood here is very very angry.''
Margaret was more succint. ''They've put us right in the grubber,''
she said.
Meanwhile, standing disconsolately outside the baker's shop in the
town's main street yesterday, Robert and Winifred Hopkirk said they had
hoped to waken to the news that East Renfrewshire would be under
Conservative control. They felt now that Labour had as good as clinched
it.
''I say it's a good thing for the Tories to lose,'' said Winifred,
''because people will now see what it's like under a Labour council, see
how their council tax goes up.''
Up and over the hill, past the reservoirs and the patio homes with
conservatories of botanical garden proportions, the residents of Newton
Mearns were not as supportive.
''I think it was inevitable for the Conservatives, you know,'' said
one formidable lady in powder blue as she swept into the Avenue shopping
centre on the arm of a friend. ''I'm a lifelong Conservative and I did
vote for them, but I think Scotland has really had a bit of a raw
deal.''
Even on polling day, some of the Tory faithful were not very sanguine
about the party's chance of outright control. Several supporters
admitted to going through the motions at the polls, expecting a Tory
defeat.
It's as well they didn't tell James Shaw, who won the Giffnock South
seat for the Conservatives on the new council. Mr Shaw was in chipper
mood at an Eastwood polling booth on Thursday, encouraging the steady
straggle of voters and sharing a flask of coffee with his Liberal
Democrat rival.
''All those allegations of gerrymandering have been nonsense,'' he
said. ''If we wanted to fit up the area all we had to do is make
Eastwood District Council a single-tier authority. It doesn't stand up.
Why would we include areas that are opposed to us like Barrhead?''
Others may now be asking the same question.
Maude and Anne, meanwhile, didn't think anyone, no matter what their
party persuasion, should have got too excited about the new council
layout.
''I'm not terribly interested in politics at all,'' said Anne. ''I
don't think I'd be too concerned. We'll just have to put up with whoever
it is.''
'I think you might be right,'' said Maude.

WHAT to do about the fish pond? Break the ice; feed the fish; start
all over again? Those in the know suggest a few steps in bringing things
back to life after a dormant winter, writes IAN WALLS.
If there is a pond filter, clean it and restart it, before fish are to
be fed on a regular basis. Then check out the water quality and nitrite
levels.
From this month temperatures should -- that's the operational word,
should -- rise to allow daily feeding on a good quality diet. How much?
As much as they take in one or two minutes.
Wakening from semi-hibernation, fish will tend to be weak and possibly
susceptible to infestation by parasites. Something the same problem as
having seedlings in a pot.
Watch out for signs of fungi or a grey, slimy coating on their skin.
Specialist outlets can recommend suitable remedies.
There is likely to be a natural increase in algae in a pond -- it
reacts more quickly than plants to increasing water temperature and
nutrient content. Algae treatment helps, and plants will also begin to
grow and the pond will clear.
Herons? A right pest at times. One answer is a net suspended six to
12in above the pond surface.
Keep it fairly taut or the birds may try to land on the net and spear
their lunch that way.

Identical rooms need not look alike, as Sue Tranter discovers when she
visits the sitting rooms of two generations
AT first there is nothing to tell them apart. Newly-built flats offer
standard fittings and rooms that are pretty much the same, give or take
an inch or two.
But what happens when the builders move out and the new proud owners
move in? As the furnishings arrive do the rooms start to take on an
individuality and a character of their own or are they destined to
remain forever cloned?
Looking at two identical flats in Glasgow it's clear that the look and
atmosphere of new homes starts to shape up with the arrival of the
furniture van.
Even though they were built to the same grand plan, the homes of
Suzanne Ritchie and her downstairs neighbours, Jimmy and Margaret Neal,
are completely different. On the second and third floor of a
three-storey block in Pollokshields, the flats were completed five years
ago. The sitting rooms in both are still covered in the original shades
of paint.
While the Neals' home has been furnished on more traditional lines,
Suzanne's has a much more contemporary feel.
It was the seclusion and look of the development that first attracted
the Neals, who were ready to move from their local house into something
on one level that would be easier to run. Having made the choice
Margaret set about deciding on furniture.
''Much of our larger pieces wouldn't fit in,'' she explains. ''But I
was delighted to find that my Minty sofa could be re-upholstered and
actually made shorter by taking out the centre panel. We bought new
curtains in pink to match the colours in the suite fabric.'' They also
bought a corner display cupboard in a classical shape and a more modern
dining suite and cabinet in teak for the other part of the room.
Suzanne Ritchie's sitting room has a large and comfortable sofa in a
practical dark grey material. The toning striped cushions, which are
repeated in the two wicker armchairs, are in a grey and white stripe by
Amanda Rosa Designs.
Suzanne already had the sofa but the rest of the furniture was bought
for the room. The cane chairs came from In House, as did the large glass
coffee table in the centre of the room. The large white side lamps were
from Habitat.
In one corner is an enormous and thriving plant in a terracotta pot
which has now reached the ceiling, while next to it stands a white table
that doubles as a desk, also from In House in Glasgow. When it isn't
being used it folds neatly back and becomes a simple but attractive
display surface.
''I wanted a look that would be practical and unfussy,'' says Suzanne.
''With a new business to run I just don't have time for lots of dusting
or looking after ornaments.''
Suzanne has just opened her own catering business and delicatessen in
nearby Nithsdale Road, so while her flat has to be relaxing to come into
after a busy day it must also be easy to care for.
Jimmy and Margaret Neal, however, feel that their room is equally
practical, giving them space for a dining table as well as the comfort
of a more traditional living area.

THINK of an Orkney chair and you probably visualise a high-backed
shape with a wooden or woven straw seat and a woven back, perhaps with a
hood, writes Mary Bennie. Similarly, the Shetland chair has a high back
and a hood but is made of solid wood.
But according to Ian Tait at the Shetland Museum, there has never been
uniformity about these chairs which were first made by crofters with
whatever materials were to hand. ''They were strong and functional. They
weren't made by professional cabinet-makers, so each had its own shape
and style. Some had higher backs than others, some had drawers beneath
the seat for storage.''
Examples of some of these early chairs can be seen in the Shetland
Museum in Lerwick, the earliest dating from the early 1800s.
Today two craftsmen, one in Orkney and one in Shetland, are using
their skills to make Orkney and Shetland chairs, which will appeal to
those who like simple, hand-crafted, traditional furniture.
Features that Orkney and Shetland chairs have in common are the
overall shape: both have high-backed versions with a hood, intended to
keep out the draughts.
Robert Towers is the only professional full-time Orkney chairmaker,
and he has been making them for 18 years. He produces two different
designs, each in four different versions, in his Kirkwall workshop and
finds a market for them all over the word.
''The earliest Orkney chairs were nothing more than a low, round stool
covered with straw,'' says Robert Towers. ''These developed into a low
chair by the addition of a straw back about two feet high and later a
hood was added. The seat was still round and the straw covering went
down to the floor.
''The first chair with a wooden seat was made in the late 18th
century. It was square and the base did not have a straw covering. The
solid wooden seat was replaced with a cord-type seat early this century,
giving the first version of the style known today as the Orkney chair.''
Robert Towers is very particular about the features that make a true
Orkney chair. ''The hoods must be a continuation of the back and the
edge of the hood should be very firm,'' he says. ''The seat should not
be narrower at the back than at the front.''
Robert Towers's Orkney chairs are available in pine or walnut, with a
straw back and optional hood and drawer. Prices start at around #670 for
a pine chair without a hood. He also makes a child's size chair in
walnut, at about the same price.
In Shetland, Kenneth Williamson is starting to make the Shetland chair
on a commercial basis. A plumbing contractor to trade, he also makes
furniture, including dressers. Shetland Islands Council asked him to
make a chair for the Shetland exhibit at the 1988 Glasgow Garden
Festival. He did some research at the Shetland Museum and that started
him off.
Kenneth Williamson uses Scandinavian pine for his chairs, which come
with optional drawer and either a low back or a high back, the latter
with a hood.
''I've been toying with the idea of making these chairs on a
commercial basis for a while and I've decided the time is right. I
believe there is a lot of interest in them outside Shetland, and I'm
hoping to tap into the Shetland associations in various countries.''
These two present-day makers are reviving an old tradition using their
furniture-making skills to produce hand-crafted items that will become
the heirlooms of the future.

THEY come soft and spongy; stylish but shaky; deep and delightful;
hard and hurtful; or, ideally, good-looking and body-hugging. But
however they come, they are, without question, the most used pieces of
furniture in the home, and as such demand attention more than most
items, writes Wendy Jack.
It's easy to fall for (or off) a handsome trend-setter. But looking
good isn't the end of the story. Comfort is equally crucial when you're
choosing a chair. And here, Dawn Reid of Reid Furniture offers some
useful suggestions to the would-be buyer . . .
* Bounce lightly on the seat to ensure the suspension is satisfactory.
* Lean into the back cushion to make sure you can't feel the springs
or framework.
* Check the front crossrail doesn't cut into the back of your knees.
* The frame shouldn't be easily felt through the arm padding.
Now. If you're sitting comfortably, cast an eye over three very
different chairs . . .
SOFT OPTION: Dawn Reid is showing the Heritage armchair in Kreta
Stripe Jade and Kreta Jade plain fabrics. It costs #527. It's also
available as part of a suite, comprising three-seater settee and two
chairs -- the price of which is #1999.
BIG MACK: Bruce Hamilton served his time as a chairmaker with the old
established (and sadly now defunct) James Robertson &amp; Sons of Johnstone.
He gets regular orders for his Charles Rennie Mackintosh reproductions,
exemplified here by his handsome Mackintosh hall chair in American oak,
for Hill House, Helensburgh. It is made to order, like all his
furniture, and costs #465. Bruce can be contacted on 0505-322550.

A POSTER which appeared all over Paris last week shows a caricature of
a Frenchman, wearing a beret but curiously with the face of Che Guevara,
carrying a baguette and accompanied by a scruffy dog, with the slogan
''A guide to collaboration''.
Given that the one certainty at the election, barring a miracle in
favour of the Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin, is a conservative
president for the next seven years, the scurrilous and anarchist weekly
magazine Charlie-Hebdo, author of the poster, has produced a special
supplement which advises its readers, with the aid of outrageous
cartoons and wickedly provocative prose, how best to collaborate with
the right-wing enemy in years to come.
With the level of debate in the election campaign flagging, and
pollsters examining the ever-narrowing lead separating Jacques Chirac
from his rival Edouard Balladur, like so many anxious junior doctors
scrutinising a temperature chart, a touch of humour is more than ever
welcome.
Charlie-Hebdo resurfaced two years ago after having become the most
famous victim of post-war censorship in France. In 1969, the magazine
was banned for a front cover devoted to the death of General De Gaulle
which occurred around the time a fire in a French discotheque had killed
dozens of teenagers. ''Tragic dance at Colombey-les-deux-Eglises: one
dead'' read the first page, which was irreverently edged in black.
About the same time, both Chirac and Balladur were getting their first
important political jobs as advisers to President Georges Pompidou,
whose regime would support no attitude to the general other than the one
of moist-eyed reverence. About 25 years on, both men claim to embody
Gaullist traditions. And once one of them gets into power, people like
the crew at Charlie-Hebdo could be in for a jolt.
During the 14 years Francois Mitterrand was president, the government
influenced the press through persuasion, but papers enjoyed an
unprecedented degree of freedom from government interference and
censorship.
Those most attached to freedom of the press are seriously worried by
recent signs of what could be to come. Last week, the country's leading
and best informed satirical paper, Le Canard Enchaine, was ruled guilty
of the unusual charge of ''handling stolen documents'' and the French
Senate put forward plans for legislation which would restrict the
freedom of the press to report and indeed reveal criminal cases.
The misdeed of Le Canard Enchaine had been to publish the tax returns
-- confidential administrative documents -- of Peugeot boss Jacques
Calvet. The forms proved that Calvet, while turning down union demands
for meagre pay rises, had hiked up his own salary by 45%.
The court ruled that the paper should have published the information
without handling or publishing the tax documents. But in that case,
Calvet could have sued it for libel and won, as Le Canard Enchaine would
not have been able to produce proof of its allegations.
Also last week, a commission composed of right-wing members of
France's Upper House, the Senate, which spent six months studying the
ways in which criminal cases are covered in the press, published
proposals for new legislation.
Ostensibly, the Senate committee is anxious to reinforce the right of
people awaiting trial to be presumed innocent, and prevent the leaking
of information which is sub-judice or confidential -- like Calvet's tax
returns.
It proposes punishing offences with fines of up to #25,000, admittedly
not much by the standards of the recent British libel cases, and
obliging newspapers to stress that anyone awaiting trial is technically
innocent.
The time during which a paper can be sued following publication would
increase from three months to three years. Senators also want to ban
editorial comment at the end of ''rights of reply'' which the law
already obliges them to print, and ban photographs showing accused
people wearing handcuffs.
Socialist and communist opposition in the Senate has expressed its
hostility to the committee's findings, which were the object of much
angry and worried comment in yesterday's issue of the left-wing and
aptly named daily paper Liberation.

Vienna, Friday
THE head of the Roman Catholic Church in Austria, Cardinal Hermann
Groer, denied today that he sexually abused a male pupil 20 years ago.
Groer, 75, resigned yesterday as head of Austria's Bishops'
Conference, nearly two weeks after the man made the allegations.
''The massive and increasing attacks against me have shaken and
disturbed many well-meaning and faithful people, causing unrest and
doubt even in the Church,'' Groer said in a signed statement published
in the daily Neue Kronen Zeitung.
''So I see that I am obliged to reject the content and form of these
defamatory and destructive criticisms,'' he said.
''In this denial, I also include all these sweeping suspicions of
priests and others teaching religion as well as the well-attended
schools of the Roman Catholic Church.''
The bishop of Graz-Seckau, Johann Weber, who took over from Groer as
chairman of the national Bishops' Conference, said earlier that the
cardinal wanted to remain silent over the sexual allegations made
against him.
''In intense talks (at the bishops' conference), the cardinal made
clear why he wants to remain silent regarding the allegations that have
been raised,'' Weber, reading a statement, told a news conference.
''The damage to his reputation is irreparable. It is extremely
unjust.''
Weber said Groer, Archbishop of Vienna, had first accepted re-election
as chairman of the conference, which ended yesterday. He reconsidered
and gave up the post.
''We understand his position. It is surely his right to remain
silent,'' said Weber.
Austria's largest Roman Catholic lay group, Catholic Action, and
leading theologians had urged Groer to break his silence and make a
statement on the allegations.
Josef Hartmann, a former pupil at a Roman Catholic school for boys,
said in an interview with the news magazine Profil last week that Groer
sexually abused him 20 years ago. Groer was then a teacher at the school
at Hollabrun, near Vienna.
Hartmann told Profil he had spoken out now because Groer issued a
document in February saying those who had sex outside marriage or abused
young boys would never enter God's kingdom.

ANKARA: A band of Kurdish rebels battling Turkey's 19-day-old drive
into northern Iraq say they will not lay down their arms until freedom
is won. Defying Turkish warnings to ''surrender or die,'' the rebels
from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) insist they know the mountainous
battleground and the ways of guerrilla warfare better than their foes.
Launched on March 20, the cross-border drive by 35,000 Turkish troops
targeted an estimated 2500 Kurdish separatist rebels who use Iraq as a
springboard to stage attacks on southeast Turkey. Ankara says the
military has killed more than 300 rebels, destroyed vast numbers of
camps and seized weapons.

IPIL: A band of Muslim rebels managed to evade pursuing Philippine
troops yesterday after savage, close-range fighting that left at least
12 guerrillas and five of their hostages dead, the military said. Three
local militiamen were also killed in the four-hour running battle fought
over the hills and forests of Mindanao island between about 100 rebels
who used hostages as ''human shields'' and hundreds of troops backed by
helicopters.

BRUSSELS: Belgium's parliament voted overwhelmingly yesterday in
favour of allowing the country's highest court to question Nato
secretary general Willy Claes over a murky defence contract scandal.
Lower house chairman Charles-Ferdinand Nothomb announced 187 deputies
had voted in favour, 16 against and one vote was spoiled. The vote took
place after a special parliamentary commission recommended that Claes
and two other former Belgian ministers be questioned in connection with
the so-called Agusta affair.

SUVA: Fiji has been gripped by ''mushroom mania'' with hundreds of
people claiming miracle cures for ailments such as asthma, baldness,
diabetes and high blood pressure after drinking tea made from a kind of
fungus. The brew, also known as kombucha, is gaining popularity in the
US and some Asian countries, according to Professor Bill Aalbersberg,
reader in chemistry at the University of the South Pacific in Suva.

WERE you aware that our beloved but now sadly assailed Loch Lomond,
lying darkly beneath the bulk of the mountain of the same name, was
known to our ancestors as Loch Leven? Fifty miles away in Fife another
Lochleven is overlooked by the Lomond Hills and both have their River
Levens. Curious, eh? This scrap of linguistic coincidence has some
significance as Scotland prepares for yet another round of local
government reorganisation.
On the north bank of the Clyde, one of the first tasks of councillors
elected this week to the shadow authority that will oversee amalgamation
of Dumbarton and Clydebank District Councils will be to confirm a
suitable name for the new single-tier council. The question of
precedence, I understand, has already been the source of debate as it
has been with Scottish local authorities since the Renaissance at least.
In 1568, for instance, the old rivals Dundee and Perth were at each
other's throats over which town should get priority behind Edinburgh in
the annual Riding of the Three Estates.
On Clydeside, Dumbarton will argue antiquity and centrality, Clydebank
will plead vitality -- and a better football team. Compromise is
necessary, and thankfully Dumclyde or Bartonbank council has been
speedily dismissed. However, it will surprise no-one who has had
anything to do with the workings of local government that clever money
is firmly on retention of the ''holding'' title for the council, the
rather yawn-provoking Dumbarton &amp; Clydebank Council, or possibly
vice-versa.
But in what was the old Dunbartonshire (or Dumbartonshire if you want
to start a rammy down that way), there is a ready-made solution if only
councillors would screw up their courage, cast mediocrity to the wind,
and show a bit of spunk.
In the reshuffle of local authorities this new council is losing its
western sector (the affluent areas north from Cardross round to
Rosneath) to Argyll and Bute. What remains stretches from the south end
of Loch Lomond, through the Vale of Leven, and along the Clyde as far as
the Glasgow boundary at Yoker. All of these locations were contained in
the huge Earldom of Lennox, which also reached as far as the northern
tip of Loch Lomond and across into the heart of what was once
Stirlingshire.
Levenachs, from the Gaelic leamhanach (a site crowded with elm trees),
was the ancient name given to the earldom. This, in turn, was easily
Latinised to Levenax, Lennax, and eventually Lennox, and some scholars
offer the same Gaelic derivation for Lomond, hence all this doubling up.
The earldom itself was granted by Malcolm Canmore (1031-1093) to Arkil,
Thane of Lennox; his son or grandson, Alwyn, is the first Earl of Lennox
of whom we have any account.
NOW, in the modern era, the name Lennox has been adopted as a title
for a wheen of worthy local institutions from the much loved local
newspaper in Dumbarton, the Lennox Herald (where I served my
apprenticeship), to an equally famous driving school. Why then should
the north bank authority not take a wee step back to move audaciously
forward into the twenty-first century?
And while we're about it, couldn't the convener adopt the title of
Thane of Lennox? That's some handle, and it would assuredly command a
respectful hearing at future Cosla meetings.

Aarrr, Jim lad, did you know that much of our conception of pirates
owes a great deal to Scotland? And, shiver me timbers, that fans young
and old can find a buried treasure trove of information in North
Queensferry? Stephen McGinty climbs up to the crow's-nest to keep a
lookout for sightings of adventurers from fact and fiction
''These men were of that old breed of rovers whose port lay always a
little further on.'' -- John Masefield.
The cost of an arm
and a leg was
1200 pieces of
eight, and one
finger was 100
THE skull and crossbones were never tinged with tartan, and a thistle
would make a poor instrument of torture, but nevertheless, it was the
Scots who invented the pirate. Though not as recognisable as television,
as much used as the telephone nor as trodden as Tarmacadam, the legend
of piracy has been salted and preserved between the pages of Robert
Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, J M Barrie's Peter Pan, and The
Pirate by Sir Walter Scott. The world's perception of pirates is now
seen through the eyeglass of our authors, but the Scottish contribution
extended past fiction and into fact.
Captain Kidd was born in Greenock in 1645. A clergyman's son, he was
granted a privateer's licence to attack the French, and a hidden agenda
to plunder other pirate ships to swell the coffers of the senior
politicians, including the Lord Chancellor, who had bought his boat. But
disaster befell the luckless pirate as first scurvy, then mutiny, robbed
him of his men. After being marooned he struggled back to Britain and
into a political storm. Betrayed and denounced as an ''obnoxious
pirate'' he was tried and hanged, his corpse tarred and displayed at
Tilbury.
Andrew Barton took to the seas in 1426, clutching a privateer
commission from the Scots King, James III, to take vengeance against
Portuguese ships for the plunder of his father's vessel. But when he
turned his attentions to English merchants trading with the Portuguese,
Henry VIII sent ships to destroy him. They discovered his ship, the
Lion, in the English Channel and battle broke out. Andrew Barton was
finally felled by an arrow through the heart. When James III complained,
Henry answered: ''The fate of pirates was never an object of dispute
among princes.''
John Paul Jones, a gardener's son from Lord Selkirk's estate on the
Solway Firth, joined an American privateer navy in 1775 and rose to the
rank of hero, the father of the US Navy, and later a rear-admiral with
the Russian navy. He began during the War of Independence attacking
British shipping off the English coast. In 1778, aided by three French
ships, he threatened Edinburgh by sailing up the Firth of Forth and
defeating HMS Serapis. His career was much longer than the pirate's
average of two years.
''If our number is small, yet out hearts are great. And the fewer
persons we are the stronger our bond and the greater shares we shall
have in the spoil.'' -- Sir Henry Morgan.
IT IS hard indeed to rehabilitate the inhuman, as many pirates were.
John Gow of Orkney abducted women whom his crew abused so badly one
died. In Spain, Roc Brauliano used to nail a prisoner's intestines to a
post and, by poking a burning log to his backside, force him to dance to
his death. Blackbeard just got drunk and shot people. But what little we
know about pirates is clearly illuminated in a slick new exhibition at
Deep Sea World in North Queensferry.
And for every confirmation of the dark hue of their hearts come
incidents of egalitarianism, democracy, and even a certain chivalry.
Hundreds of years before any Act of Parliament, they used a
one-man-one-vote system in electing the captain. Compensation was
carefully constructed. The cost of an arm and a leg was 1200 pieces of
eight, one finger was 100. And families left fatherless were looked
after.
''There was a backlash against them because they were ruthless and it
was how they lived their lives,'' said Alex Kilgour, promotions manager
at Deep Sea World and the exhibition's organiser along with manager
Charles Bickett. ''But in their own way they were very honourable. They
had crews of mixed colours -- this was unheard of at the time. The Welsh
pirate Bartholomew Roberts used to drink only tea and he insisted his
crew sang daily hymns.''
Pirates: The Unknown Story displays the facts behind the popular
fantasy and reveals Scotland's role in both. A mixture of visual
re-creations and text digs up the past and lays it for out for a closer
inspection. For example, a pirate was a sea robber. A privateer was a
licensed pirate, carrying a commission or a ''Letter of Marque'', while
a buccaneer is a term used for the Caribbean pirates and privateers.
Wandering round the exhibiton is to play pick 'n' mix with pirate
treasure -- treasures like the original manuscript of Barrie's Peter Pan
and the costumes from the first stage production. Later this month the
original colour prints, drawn by Francis Bedford to illustrate the book,
will be displayed for the first time. ''We've managed to secure them
from a private collector,'' said a justifiably proud Kilgour.
As pirates can hold a child's interest as long as dinosaurs, the
exhibition has been designed with the interest of tiny terrors in mind.
Roger Law, creator of Spitting Image, and a piramaniac, has designed a
latex scene from Treasure Island and there is a romper room called
Never-Never Land. The exhibition is evolving. It is planned to have
Peter Pan rides across the water outside the complex. ''We're working
closely with the Kirby Ballet, who handle flying acts for the theatre,''
said manager Charles Bickett. Later this month the exhibition will
expand to include the text from the Royal Maritime Museum's exhibition.
''Pirates are found who will spend two or three thousand pieces of
eight in a night, not leaving themselves a good shirt to wear in the
morning.'' -- Alexander Esqumeling.
IT'S NOT known if pirates always spoke in the present tense, but
walking the plank can certainly be discarded from their popular
mythology. Pirates weren't know for their patience and it was easier to
just heave the sorry sailor over the side. Marooning was another popular
method of discipline. Though treasure maps are part of pirates'
historical inheritance few, except Captain Kidd, who buried his on
Manhattan Island, ever raised a shovel. Treasures were instead buried in
wine and women.
Alexander Esqumeling, who sailed with buccaneers, was also quoted as
saying: ''I saw one of them give unto a common strumpet 500 pieces of
eight, only that he might see her naked.'' This may be the perfect
picture of pirates at play, but historians have also discovered
different accounts of the Pirate Articles of Agreement, all similar and
including such liberal lines as: ''If at any time you meet with a
prudent woman, that man that offers to meddle with her without her
consent shall suffer present death.''
Despite the popularity of the subject few experts exist. ''The
National Maritime Museum wanted to prepare a pirate exhibition and
looked for a curator, but could find no-one. So David Gordingly of the
museum spent six months researching the subject. Now he's one of the
world's few experts. He's acted as adviser on a number of movies,
including Ted Turner's new six-hour documentary series coming next
year,'' said Kilgour.
Alex Kilgour's passion for pirates was ignited by Barry Clifford, the
American adventurer who raised #400 million of treasure from The Whydah,
a pirate ship which sank off the coast of Cape Cod. Clifford's latest
project, in partnership with Kilgour, is to locate the treasure of King
Charles I, lost off Burntisland. Last summer the project discounted a
number of surface targets and Clifford's crew will return shortly to
continue the search.
''Through Barry I've met nearly all of the major names in pirate
research and I got to thinking that no-one has celebrated the Scottish
connection. The fact that we, through the works of Stevenson, Barrie,
and Scott, have given the world the popular image of pirates. I tried to
get Disney to lend us the video of Peter Pan for Never-Never Land; we
didn't get it but they wouldn't believe that Walt Disney never wrote it,
a Scotsman did!''
''Had you but fought like men you would not be dying like dogs.'' --
Mary Read and Anne Bonny.
THE dirty-mac notion of female pirates in thigh-length boots to shiver
your timbers may still be reflected in saucy seaside post cards, but the
fantasy was far removed from the formidable reality. In 1717 Mary Read
and Anne Bonny both sailed the high seas. During her time in disquise
Mary Read, in order to defend her secret lover, fought a duel with a
dangerous swordsman. As he lay dying from her sword wounds, she flashed
her chest, revealing her true identity and adding cruel insult to fatal
injury.
Read was born in Plymouth in 1690 and raised as a boy in order to
claim an inheritance. She went to sea as a man and her ship was attacked
by pirates; as the only ''Englishman'' on board she was asked to join
them. Anne Bonny was the woman of ''Calico Jack'' Rackman, nicknamed for
his fetish for lacy underwear, and when his ship attacked Read's vessel,
she joined them. Both women were captured and spared the rope through
being pregnant. However, they were so disgusted by their shipmates that
they screamed the abuse that is printed above.
There is a mannequin of Mary Read stabbing the man who would have
harmed her lover, but her top is laced up. Alex explains that ''we've
got to tone it down for the kiddies''. Despite the male dress, the notes
reveal that their crewmates later accepted them as women, allowing a
more liberal dress sense on board while both women retained their manly
tunics for battle. Next year Geena Davis runs up the rigging and plays
Anne Bonny in a new movie, Cut-throat Island.
Perhaps the most startling part of the pirate exhibition is the little
bit of the present which tugs you back from the past. Present-day piracy
exists and is under-reported, lost among the waves of distant coastal
waters. To raise the profile, the London-based International Maritime
Bureau, which collates all world-wide information and sends warnings to
shipping, has become involved. Eric Ellen, the director of the IMB,
said: ''Piracy is violent crime at sea.''
Today pirates have replaced cutlasses with Armalite rifles and
cannonballs with rocket-powered grenades. Coastal waters around
Malaysia, China, and the Philippines have become a barrel shoot for
cut-throat gangs who attack merchant vessels, capture the crew, and
either transfer the cargo or pull into a port and ransom the crew.
A short documentary details the current problems and a map pinpoints
the location of the most recent attacks.
There is little pirate activity in the Firth of Forth, but just off
the motorway entrance to North Queensferry, three flags bearing the
skull and crossbones flutter in the breeze. The spirits of Blackbeard,
Captain Morgan, and William Kidd have unlatched Davy Jones's locker and
returned. So pay your pieces-of-eight entrance fee, it's a pirate town
now.
* Entrance to Deep Sea World costs #4.60 for adults; children and
concessions #3.35. The exhibition, for which there is no further charge,
is open 9.30 am-6pm.

When Scots plan a
short break, they
focus their gaze
north -- but there
is a lot to be
found just south
of the Border.
Doreen-Taylor
Wilkie reports
IT'S A curious thing about most Scots but, if they go away for the day
or for a weekend, more tend to go north rather than south, so people
from the Central Belt head up for the Highlands, whereas Borderers or
Gallovidians may get no further than Glasgow or Edinburgh.
Just for a change, this week I have decided to reverse the process and
have a look at what is going on on the other side of the Border, in
Northumbria, Cumbria, and the rest.
Northumbria has almost as many castles and fortified towers as the
Borders, which is no surprise. In centuries past both sides used them,
often against one another, as the cattle-reiving and bloody battles
continued apace.
Even the family names are often the same on both sides of the Border,
and Bamburgh Castle, high on the coast south of Berwick, is the home of
Lady Armstrong. Its site was a royal centre as long ago as AD 547, and
it is still a home. A tour includes rooms such as the Grand King's Hall
and the special Armstrong Museum. The museum's latest expansion is an
aircraft-industry section which tells of the Armstrong family's
connections with aviation, from its first pioneering venture as
Armstrong Whitworth in 1910 to its merger with the Gloster Aircraft
Company in the 1960s.
Alnwick Castle is a true Border fortress and parts go back to the
eleventh century. The Norman family of Percys took over in 1309, and,
compared with the rugged outside, the interior is rich comfort, with
some superb Titians, Van Dycks, and Canalettos. Nearby Preston Tower is
an authentic peel tower which would have been as grimly at home on the
other side of the Border.
Further south, in Bishop Auckland, Auckland Castle was the Bishop's
Palace, and has a beautiful seventeenth-century chapel and an earlier
hall, and Raby Castle has a marvellous Great Kitchen, little changed
over 600 years, though the copper utensils are Victorian. One of the
best is Chillingham Castle, inland from Bamburgh, with a jousting
course, chilly dungeons, and even a torture chamber. But the name
Chillingham gets its greatest fame from the unique Chillingham wild
white cattle which graze the parkland further south. Once they inhabited
the primeval forests of Britain. Because they were enclosed as long as
700 years ago, the breed remains pure, uncrossed with any other strain
of cattle, and many find a strange excitement in this perfect, unbroken
link to the past.

Warden (for cattle): 01668 215250.
* CUMBRIA to the west may not have quite so many castles but it does
have Wordsworth, and the three establishments connected with the poet
are now more closely connected through an arrangement for a joint
ticket.
The poet was born at Wordsworth House in Cockermouth. This fine
Georgian town house is in the care of the National Trust. Dove Cottage
at Grasmere was Wordsworth's home from 1799 to 1808, his most creative
period. Here he married Sarah Hutchinson. Today, the cottage is in
beautiful condition, looked after by the Wordsworth Trust. Rydal Mount
at Rydal was where he spent the longest part of his life, from 1813
until his death in 1850, and where the gardens were landscaped by the
poet himself. The house is still owned by the family and holds many of
the poet's personal possessions, as well as a collection of family
portraits.
From this month to October, Dove Cottage and Wordsworth Museum will
also celebrate the John Keats Bicentenary with a special exhibition of
poems, manuscripts, and other treasurers of this Romantic poet.
(Information: Sylvia Wordsworth: 01539-43554.)
Continuing the poetic theme, the Summer Academy, which arranges
holiday study, will later in the year hold a course on Lakeland Poets --
Old and New at the University of Lancaster's Lake District Campus at
Ambleside. This links the work of Coleridge and Worsworth with modern
Lakeland poets: Norman Nicholson, William Scammell, David Scott, and
David Wright. (Information: Summer Academy 01227 470402.)
For more general Cumbrian and Lake District touring, Mountain Goat is
a company which specialises in off-the-beaten-track holidays and
excursions, using a robust minicoach for short breaks, week-long tours,
or a combination of touring and walking. Based at Windermere, the
company is coming up for its Silver Jubilee next year, and now tours in
eight areas of Britain. Mountain Goat also has a programme of daily
tours for locals and visitors, and a Mountain Goat Holiday Club for
regular supporters. (Information: 01539 445164.)
From April 22 until May 8, the biggest event in this part of Northern
England is the North Pennines Festival, a first event which aims to look
right across the arts, and to show the unspoilt countryside almost as an
art form in itself. Music ranges from baroque to traditional and brass
band; many art studios all over the area will be open, and there will
also be special exhibitions of pottery, box-making, tapestries, and
more, with artist-led walks to bring in the countryside. Practical
outdoor events include dry-stone walling (drystane diking), steam
trains, wildlife photography, a beer and wine festival, more than 70
events in all. The formal opening takes place on April 24 at the Market
Cross at Alston, with a specially commissioned fanfare for brass quintet
by North Pennines jazz composer Keith Morris, attracted by the challenge
of the instruments. ''We want to let people know not just how beautiful
this part of the country is,'' said festival co-ordinator Harriet Sykes,
''but also to let them find the quality and diversity of the artists,
craftspeople and performers who live and work here.'' (Information:
01697 73435.)
* EDINBURGH is gearing up for what will be Scotland's biggest event of
1995 -- the Cutty Sark Tall Ships race in July, which will spend four
days in the Port of Leith before it sets sail to race to Bremerhaven in
Germany. Already the police are predicting that more than a million
people will come down to the docks to see the great fleet during its
four-day stay, and the QE2 is turning up to wave them off. They will be
greeted by street and marching bands, a quayside stage with many
performers, children's entertainment in the Marks &amp; Spencer Family
Gardens, and an outdoor circus. The night before the tall ships sail out
will end in a huge fireworks display. Then on July 18, Princess Anne
will fire the gun to start the first leg of the race.

A new clutch of guide
books reawakens in
Lorn Macintyre a
yearning for sights
and sounds that will
forever be precious
MY WIFE and I have had many transcendental moments in our travels in
the Hebrides over the years. Sitting on the top deck of the ferry from
Colonsay in the flat calm midnight, we glimpse a porpoise rolling
westward as darkness withdraws islands one by one. At the stone oval of
Pobull Fhinn (Finn's People), on North Uist, we sense that we are not
alone in the early evening, though the only other visible presence is an
otter eating supper in the shallows. In the church on Eriskay, built
with the bounty from the sea, a clicking sound against the pew behind
us, the oldest man on the island kneels with his rosary.
Shuffling through a parcel of new guide books recently, I found one on
Mull with a panoramic picture of Tobermory on the front cover; I was
back at the window of that turreted house on the seafront, listening to
Bobby MacLeod fingering out Muile Nam Fuar-bheann Mrr (Mull of the Cold
High Hills) on an accordion at a ceilidh in the Aros Hall compered by my
father, while a newly arrived yacht spilled its anchor into the bay.
The new Pevensey Island Guides, from David &amp; Charles, the publishing
house that has made an important contribution to Scottish history
through its series of books on Scottish islands, are the best guide
books I have ever seen and make me yearn for summer again, for a boat
with a gangway, binoculars, and a place to lay my head.
Guide books have been essential items in the luggage of travellers for
centuries. When the steamboats began taking tourists to the islands in
the 1800s there were guides (called companions) to slip out of the
pocket to identify gentlemen's seats such as Bullough's extravaganza on
Rhum.
The Pevensey Island Guides are in a format pleasant to handle, with
superb colour photography and an informative text intelligently divided.
The pledge on each cover is that this is ''the essential guide for the
discerning tourist and island devotee: everything the visitor needs to
know about the islands' heritage, landscape, climate, flora, and
fauna.'' The paperback costs #7.99, hardback #10.99.
Norman Newton, the Reference Librarian at Inverness Public Library,
has used his extensive knowledge of islands, Highland history, and
archaeology to write three of the new guides, on Skye, Islay, and
Shetland. The guide to Orkney is by Patrick Bailey, a Cambridge
geographer with a life-long interest in the geography, history, and
archaeology of the lands of the Norse settlement around the North
Atlantic margins, and who has been a regular visitor to Orkney. He took
most of the superb photographs in his guide.
The guide to Arran is a revision by Norman Newton of the excellent
book on that island written by the late Robert McLellan for the David &amp;
Charles Island series. It was first published in 1970, and updated by
the author in 1976 and 1985.
The Mull &amp; Iona guide is by P A MacNab, a friend of my late father.
The son and grandson of Mull men, he is the foremost living authority on
that island, having moved there with his family in 1906.
More and more people are going to our islands as the crowded summer
ferries leaving from Oban, other west coast ports, and Aberdeen show.
With warnings about skin cancer, the temperate climates of the western
and northern islands may become more attractive than the heat of Spain.
People don't go to the islands only for relaxation; some are renewing
ancestral links that city life has loosened, others want to learn about
history that schools have failed to teach them.
Much of the geological and cultural history of Scotland is preserved
in its islands, in bare windswept places where the developer's
mechanical shovel cannot reach. Iona is dear to me, as it is to so many
people worldwide, but I don't find the beginning in the restored granite
of the medieval Abbey and the sign-boarded remains of the Nunnery. As
Hugh MacDiarmid pointed out in a poem: ''There are plenty of ruined
buildings in the world, but no ruined stones.''
To discover the true beginning of the significance of Iona you have to
turn in the opposite direction from the tourists coming off the constant
ferry from Mull. A climb will take you to the horseshoe-shaped bay,
piled high with the pebbles of countless tides, where the disgraced
Columba, who had caused many deaths in a battle, arrived from Ireland on
Pentecost Sunday in 563 AD to redeem himself through the conversion of
souls. Because he was of the blood royal of Ireland he would have had
with him a professional crew on the oars, the hide hull of the coracle
polished with butter for speed, the gospels in waterproof bags.
You can read subsequent chapters in the layered history of Scotland in
the preserved ruins of Jarlshof in Shetland. The remains were revealed
by a storm in 1905, with later excavations showing Neolithic occupation;
successive Bronze Age levels with intact houses; an Iron Age broch,
followed by a later wheelhouse; Pictish houses and a medieval Norse
village.
These helmeted men who came from the icy north in their lethal ships
butchered the monks at prayer before torching the wood and wattle
monastery on Iona, but though the exquisite Book of Kells had to be
taken to Ireland for safety, and the Iona site abandoned, Christianity
had by then reached the Scottish mainland and far beyond.
The new guides also cover wildlife. I have spent blissful days on the
deck of Richard Fairbairns's Sea Life Surveys boat, watching minke
whales breaching off Ardnamurchan. In a heatwave on the island of Ulva
off Mull, my wife and I were treated to the breath-stopping vision of a
sea eagle out of Rhum floating over a cliff.
The advantage of going to the islands featured in these guides is that
they also give you access to smaller islands, such as Raasay off Skye,
the Treshnish Islands off Mull, and the islands of the Orkney and
Shetland archipelagos.
One summer my wife and I went out with Ian Morrison, who runs Turus
Mara cruises to Lunga in the Treshnish Isles off Mull. The boat
departed, leaving us alone with the puffins on the slope. The reason for
staying on Lunga was to write about Sir Frank Fraser Darling, who had
gone there to study the Atlantic grey seal half a century earlier.
We pitched our tent where we had camped, by the ruined houses, and
once the surrounding islands had faded after sunset we settled to sleep.
We were awakened by a ''kitty-cooroo'' cry. It wasn't a ghost returning
to the scattered stones around our tent, but Manx shearwaters coming
ashore under cover of darkness to settle in their burrows around us.
There are those who complain that glossy guide books are contributing
to the ruination of the precarious ecosystem and cultures of the Western
Isles and the Northern Islands by encouraging more and more people to go
to these places. But if people do not go to the village of Portnahaven
at the southern end of the Rinns peninsula on Islay and hear Gaelic
spoken on the street, and if they do not go to Orkney and see the
congregation of birds on the stacs, they will not understand what needs
to be conserved in these vital islands.
Meantime, I peruse the new guide books and plan the summer. God
willing, my mother will still be at the window of her house in
Tobermory, watching for us coming from the ferry, and Richard Fairbairns
will call to tell us to get down to Quinish early because the minke
whales are off Ardnamurchan.

Unfeeling and immobile, a glitzy monument to tack is
an even bigger disaster than when the Mob ruled.
Andrew Meehan reflects on a one-time gambler's
paradise that is now home to the homeless, drop-outs,
and Vietnam vets, all existing in a never-never land
DISNEYFICATION. n (1995); the act or instance of assuming, through the
process of assimilation, the traits and characteristics more commonly
associated with a theme park (ie Disney World) than with real life. To
understand fully Disneyfication, it's important to know what it's not.
For example, New York's World Financial Centre is too authentic, too
tastefully understated, to qualify as having been Disneyfied. And
besides, it is actually used for something. Genuine Disneyfication must
be tawdry, contrived, useless, and dripping with class panic.
In the States, you can see it in shopping malls, those insulated
mini-kingdoms that are spawning their own fairground attractions. It's
even in their national defence programme, where Star Wars stands out as
the Pentagon's great hope of Disneyfying outer space. And it's in Las
Vegas -- a gambling theme park that somehow seems less real than Toon
Town.
Approaching Vegas at night is like flying into the biggest birthday
cake in the world. Come sunset, after showtime, Las Vegas stages its own
version of the passegiata, when thousands converge on the Strip, moving
in broken strides, emptying into casinos, continuing the fight against
sleep. They like to walk because it makes them feel virtuous.
Over at Bally's, Engelbert is getting a little older, teeth shorter,
pancake and eyeliner thicker. These days, people don't go to Vegas for
Debbie Reynolds's Gloria Swanson impersonation, but for the chance to
espy Rupaul at the Clinique counter in Nieman Marcus.
For most people, Las Vegas and a seven-foot transvestite Rupaul
wouldn't seem to go together. With his massive, busty figure, cascading
blonde wig, and perpetual ingratiating smile, Rupaul might seem more
suited to a convict's masturbatory fantasy. But all the old values have
been reassigned. Even gender.
Irritants, anarchists, drop-outs, disoriented Vietnam Vets, all come
to Vegas looking for that place in the sun. Washed up on the shore of
prosperity, they find themselves stuck in a sinister kind of never-never
land. The clothes don't match the cars, which don't match the futuristic
vista of the Strip.
Fancy this; a friend of mine is checking into the big, black,
Egyptian-themed triangle called the Luxor, and the desk clerk tells him
it's been ''1500 in, 1500 out''. Like those are significant numbers in a
hotel built to house 2500.
The Luxor, owned by Circus Circus and, until recently, headed by
William Bennett, is just one of the many disasters that have sprung out
of the desert in recent years. Opened as a public relations nightmare 18
months -- with faulty plumbing, inoperable lifts, and non-existent room
service -- it is an architecturally insignificant waste. Its sole saving
grace, say some, is a virtual-reality games room. Yowza.
As one Spy magazine wag put it: ''The conflict of Vegas is, you take
your kids there, and they're greeted by Johnny Casino wearing a Mickey
Mouse cap, smiling and waving. Five years down the line, you're gonna
find that Johnny was a paedophile, and you let him take care of your
kids.''
The old Moe Greens were cats who protected the interests of mob
investments. They caught cheats, collected debts, and provided other
strong-arm enforcement. Today's Moe Greens are on boards of directors,
state regulatory committees, strangling Vegas with consortiums and
privileges. The corporations make big people money, but the dealers, the
taxi drivers, don't get a cut anymore. There are no social services
capable of dealing with the homeless who arrive looking for free food
and a fun book, and the corporations are taking no responsibility. The
Mafia would take a hundred thou, and give 50 back to the city. The
corporations take the hundred and keep every penny.
In truth, the only way to restore the true Vegas image sullied by the
likes of Steve Wynn is the upcoming Scorsese feature Casino, starring
Joe Pesci and Robert de Niro (who else?).
And Vegas is pricing itself out of its own market. The more money they
throw at Las Vegas, the more unfeeling, immobile, and static it becomes.
Hometown resorts are springing up around the country, and like an
over-hyped Hollywood blockbuster, the new Vegas will probably go bust
quicker than EuroDisney.
A little Vegas lore: the Harlem and Chicago mobs initially controlled
Las Vegas under the masterminds of Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel. Benny
Binion started building casinos, as did a sax player, Paul Louden (now
chairman of Sahara Resorts). No legitimate company in the world would
invest in a town considered to be immoral, illegal, and fattening. Jimmy
Hoffa saw a big profit in Vegas, however, and after years of badgering
his Teamster pension fund administrators, finally got them to invest 10%
of their portfolio.
In 1966, Howard Hughes legitimised Vegas as a place in which to
invest. Valley Bank (now Bank of America) bought in, and the Mormons
gave their blessing to gambling, as long as they were tithed heavily
from the revenue pool.
Along with Jackie Gaughan and Sam Boyd, the late Benny Binion was
instrumental in founding Vegas. Binion would hack off a dishonest
dealer's fingers on a chopping block, and allegedly shot and killed a
guy outside his casino for breaking a glass. But the professional
gambler, too, is a dying breed. The card counters are banned from every
casino unwilling to gamble on their action. The only woman ever to rank
in the world series of poker, Susie Isaacs, still plays at Binion's
Horseshoe, but even there she has to contend with busloads of tourists
clutching 99-cent breakfast coupons.
Vegas's reputation for tack was transformed in 1972 with the
publication of Learning from Las Vegas. In this seminal text, Robert
Venturi, Denise Scott Brown, and Steven Izenour tried to show that the
commercial strip was more than the urban blight critics dismissed it as,
but a new architecture -- even an anti-architecture -- that followed its
own rules.
For example, in the Vegas of the 70s, the authors stressed the
importance of outsize road signs. Unlike the ancient bazaars of Morocco,
where few signs were needed because all the sights and smells were in
such close proximity, large signs were needed to capture the attention
of the motorist cruising down the strip. Twenty years later, the sign
has become the building, whether it's the Luxor or the Excalibur, the
reproduction of the castle built by King Ludwig of Bavaria.
Like something out of The Sorcerer's Apprentice, these signs have also
sprung to life and become a theatre, from the volcano outside Steve
Wynn's ''Mirage'', with its 40ft flame and 400m BTUs of natural gas
(scented with pina colada to hide the big fart smell), to the two
galleons surrounding Steve Wynn's Treasure Island doing battle almost
hourly. Everyone is part of this spectacle, turning themselves into
living, breathing signage; from the workers who wear elaborate theme
costumes to the visitors who buy some 10,000 T-shirts a month at the
Luxor.
But while a little post-modern irony could inspire a little harmless
learning from the Vegas of the 50s and 60s (candy-coated, even with the
nostalgia we feel for the period), no-one today is defending the
monstrous tack of the New Vegas. Quite the reverse. The casinos, with
their lack of light and love of lucre, are seen as unnatural places.
Details like the rising and setting sun on the hour every hour in the
revamped Forum of Caesar's Palace, or the incredible profusion of skulls
at Treasure Island, are recounted to conjure up a hell on earth.
Others point to the fact that this place is an oasis -- a mirage, a
monstrous devourer of water in the middle of the desert -- to suggest
that it is against nature. Others feel the way in which people are
manipulated, from the luxurious patterned carpets that provide eye-candy
for the people feeding the insatiable slots, to names like Luxor,
Emerald City, and even Treasure Island, which conjure up mouth-watering
delusions of wealth.
All this hostility is encapsulated by denouncing the city as an
architectural fraud. Which is quite true. It's a glorious con. These
modern cathedrals have no respect for rules of taste and invert
virtually all of the dearly held architectural rules about integration,
permanence, structure, aesthetics, authentics. In fact, the genius of
Vegas is its delight in trouncing them all at once.
Vegas is not architecture for architects, but architecture by set
designers lured from Hollywood; downtown in Glitter Gulch, a massive
canopy of lights is being planned to wrap the old part of the Strip,
which has been eclipsed by the massive developments at the new end.
Instead of the big black hole in the sky, this artificial firmament will
create a brighter, better starry night around the clock.
Each Labour Day, on the first weekend in September, Vegas rolls out
the barrel. In the country that has always been quick to turn its back
on its own, Jerry Lewis and his showbiz buddies gather at the Sahara
Hotel to sing ''You'll Never Walk Alone'' out of tune as part of
America's largest telethon. The spectacle of Lewis, sweating and
weeping, begging for the folks out there to fork out enough bucks to
save ''my kids'', is as distasteful and demeaning as anything in this
town.
It has always seemed ironic that Lewis, who has spent virtually his
entire professional career working to help people with neuromuscular
diseases, built that very career through a stage persona that was so
spastic as to seem disabled, so dopey as to seem retarded. While Lewis's
career was at its height, he surely didn't imagine that the time would
come when generations of younger people who never knew him as the
world's most famous comedian would recognise him primarily as the guy
who sings ''You'll Never Walk Alone'' off-key every Labour Day.
In the golden age of Las Vegas, in the 50s and 60s, crooners could
turn Paul Anka pop songs into national anthems and now, years later,
they still face the final curtain, although the end, paradoxically,
doesn't seem to have drawn much nearer.
For 40 years, Tony Bennett has been on the world's stage, giving it
some grief, taking his bows. And the legendary torch singer with the
wiry hair is in the midst of a smouldering comeback. But an evening at
the Desert Inn with Tony Bennett is more than a sentimental journey --
it's a trip to the moon and beyond, a kind of out-of-body experience for
the singer and the audience. Oh, his voice is deeper, but it has never
been stronger, and no-one can carry a tune with more dignity, or work
their way into the core of the lyric.
And if Vegas is our contemporary Casablanca, the Desert Inn is
something like Rick's Place -- sooner or later everyone shows up there.
Scarface wannabees, slimy fixers, scandal-scarred union representatives,
all make their way to this vast, murky, human swamp of con-artistry and
criminality.
So why celebrate this aberration, this planning executive's
drug-crazed fantasy? Tony Bennett's six-night run is why . . . For the
moment, though, the Desert Inn's only theme would seem to be one of
elegant dilapidation. This could lead you to imagine that it suffers
from some kind of affliction such as poverty or lack of foresight on
behalf of its owners. Nothing of the sort. This hotel has the
best-appointed showroom in Las Vegas and is probably the only one yet to
succumb to the techniques of titillation. But for how long? The huge
hotel conglomerate ITT Sheraton has just made its first foray into Las
Vegas and plans to spend $1 billion building a 5000-room mega resort
next door to the hotel.
Patient and sympathetic, Tony Bennett is an unstoppable
conversationalist, taking in everything from haiku poetry to a lunch
appointment with Pete Sampras. And on stage when he talks, the showroom
crowd lean into his next word, as it would surely become a precious
memory.
As the Ralph Sharon Trio stroke their instruments in a gentle vamp,
Tony steps back up to the microphone, and begins to give thanks. This
isn't the usual sugary homily that blights so many Vegas shows, but a
quiet dignified word of mutual appreciation. Earlier that afternoon, he
had spoken with paternal amusement of the resurgence of his career,
where he has become used to the wild applause of audiences who wouldn't
know the difference between what their ears told them and what the New
York Times told them. His appreciation of the old-school high-life
audience is obvious, and tonight he promises to return, which even at 68
does not seem a vain promise. There is a very wise line in the film
Prizzi's Honour: ''The calendar takes care of everything, Charlie.''
Let's hope it takes care of Tony.
So, there you have it. Las Vegas's visual portfolio seems too richly
stocked, its lifestyles too contingent, for it to be possible to come
away with a definitive memory. A final selection of images seems
arbitrary and elusive. A word of advice. Go there with a full set of
illusions or none at all. Switching back and forth will leave you
stranded.
On the last night of my trip to Vegas, walking back through the lobby
of the Desert Inn, in past the security guards with absurd gun-belts
hung on their paunches, past the waitresses filling up jugs of
buttermilk, I had a thought.
Should we really stop this insanity? It's all too easy to toll the
bells of the Apocalypse, harder to make sense of it all. In times past,
we could discern value by what had endured, and what to build in the
future was dictated by what was built in the past. But not any more.
History has been tossed aside, creating a chaotic architecture without
architects. But chaos only prescribes things where we can't see a
pattern. In the chance collage of Vegas lies a new order that we are
only beginning to discern.
Vegas is a phoenix rising out of the ashes of authenticity -- which
may sound radical, but is really nothing new: Moscow's Red Square, seen
as the apotheosis of Russian architecture, was, in fact, created by
Italian set designers.

HAVING spent two years marshalling baying herds of semi-sober oiks in
provincial British nightclubs for Channel 4's The Word, Katie Puckrik is
agreed that she has done wacky for a living as much as doing wacky for a
living should ever be done.
''Wacky,'' Katie says, prettily wrinkling her scarlet lips into a moue
of distaste prior to our partaking of afternoon tea in a swank London
nosheteria opposite the BBC's HQ.
''Wacky is one of those words that you tight-assed Brits are always
using with mindless abandon about us delightfully-unbuttoned American
types. And whenever I hear 'wacky', it always makes me think of a dumb
old dog with its head sticking out of a car window and its tongue
lolling down.
''Of all the descriptions I've had, wacky is the worst . . . worse
than kooky . . . at least kooky denotes eccentricity and individuality.
But all these words are part of a horrible, sloppy form of journo
shorthand, the urge to pigeon-hole -- part of a process which dismisses
women in the media more easily and readily than men.
''But yes, I have to admit that The Word drew on certain of my wackier
tendencies, and it proved I could handle rowdy outside broadcasts in the
middle of nowhere. But I'd like to think I have much more to offer.''
While this last line might make Katie Puckrik sound like a Baywatch
bimbo contemplating the heavyweight neo-Shakespearean dramatic
legitimacy conferred by a role in Falcon Crest, she ain't no dummy.
Indeed, since she left The Word's brainless confines, Katie has revealed
herself as an intelligent and punchy voice on radio as well as a
thoughtfully-perky commentator on the pages of Elle, Tatler, and the
Guardian.
''I'd always written my own links and scripts on The Word, and after I
left the show, magazines approached me with the idea, I guess, that if I
could write as strangely as I spoke, then I might be capable of some
interesting opinion pieces.
''TV is the most wonderful ego-boosting experience imaginable, and The
Word was a remarkable opportunity that plopped out of nowhere. But after
the first year, when I'd proved I wasn't thrown by live TV, I began to
become frustrated. I was always doing the OBs when I wanted to do the
interviews, and it was evident that I wasn't going to be hosting the
show.
''It did funny things to my head. I found myself thinking: 'Should I
listen to what the producers are telling me I can and can't do? Should I
limit myself?' It was very scarey to give up The Word, the money, the
trimmings and trappings. But it was the best move I ever made.
''I worked on Mark Radcliffe's Radio 1 show, which focused on my
words, not my appearance. I've done a short run alongside Donna McPhail
on The Sunday Show on BBC2, a presenter-led programme. I spent six
months with MTV in the States, returning to Britain last autumn. And now
there's The Entertainment Superhighway, which we see as a fresh way of
working on radio because it's dry and witty, and not only does it draw
listeners in, it sends reporters out, too.''
And what is The Entertainment Superhighway? Independently fashioned
for the BBC's emergent one-year-old Radio 5 Live by Planet 24, the
production company who were Katie's old mentors at The Word, The
Entertainment Superhighway is ''a glorified what's on and what's been
on, with funny interactive moments''.
Chief among the funny interactive moments should be the Turbo Critic
slot, in which a roving reporter with a mobile phone will be dispatched
venue-wards in order to secure, for example, a playful mid-gig, on-stage
interview with Phil Collins. Similarly, fearless investigators with
cellphones will be attempting weekly to report live from disparate
cultural battlegrounds. The front-row mosh-pit of a Metallica metalfest,
say, or the cloistered calm of the stalls at an opening night at
Sadler's Wells.
''We have this image of a whispering voice: 'Here we are at the opera,
and there's blood and guts exploding out of Genoese corsets all over the
place -- meanwhile, up on the stage, there's quite a lot of drama, too.'
Not because we're making fun of opera, but because we want to bring it
alive. So many forms of art are closed off and made intimidating.
''Plus there's the Second Coming, which will look at celebrity
comebacks, and Stars On The Box, which is a stars' guide to their
favourite TV shows. We've got video reviews from a video-shop owner in
Bradford; Planet Of The Stars, featuring the superstars we've never
heard of in Britain, such as mega-successful Costa Rican soap actresses
who earn more than the country's national debt.''
Moreover, the whole shebang will be based in a separate British city
week by week, deploying its mix of live music; live guests; book reviews
performed in the style of local radio ads; showbiz gossip.
Kinda tabloidy, huh? But only according to Katie's own more positive
definition of tabloid. Under her terms, The Entertainment Superhighway
is meant to be viewed as healthily irreverent; rude; salacious;
shocking; cynical; surprising, and the antithesis of pompous.
All these qualities were possibly in short supply during Katie's
childhood. Her father was a USAF colonel who globetrotted from US
embassy to US embassy on the diplomatic circuit during the era of
cold-war skulduggery. Moscow, Berlin, London. ''It looked like my dad's
job was giving cocktail parties and exchanging meaningful glances with
the agents of foreign powers over dry Martinis.
''As a kid living in an embassy, I led a rich fantasy life,
disseminating false information via the bugs that were planted in every
room. 'This is the latest record by the Rolling Stones,' I'd pointedly
be saying, 'the latest record that we have in the West . . . and that
you don't have here.'
''I'd have to say that my writing has been highly influenced by what I
read back then -- which was Mad magazine. I had a subscription as an
eight-year-old, when I was far too young to understand everything that
Mad was spoofing. I just enjoyed all these words that began with sch-
that Mad's team of Jewish writers used: schmuck, schmo, schlemiel,
schlep.
''And I read a lot of tawdry True Confessions magazines when I was 12,
and they would excite me in ways I didn't understand, and I would be
walking around calling people no-goodniks who were gonna take a one-way
ticket to Palookaville.''
Meanwhile, Katie had enlisted as a top-class professional dancer,
pushing back the frontiers of contemporary terpsichorean endeavour with
DV8, Michael Clark, and Jacob Marley. ''With Michael, I was in I Am
Kurious Oranj, with the Fall. I did a season in Glasgow in 1990 with
Jacob in The Second Sitting. Glasgow is a real city, an entity . . . the
people, the buildings, the over-sized windows for all that strange,
cold, clear light. And Marks and Spencer in Glasgow sells snowballs,
your wonderful Scottish Willie Wonka-type desserts that are too ethnic
for the rest of the country.''
Katie still participates in regular body-conditioning and ballet
classes -- ''I try to do them five days a week'' -- and would welcome a
return to the stage, although it would have to be in something of
artistic worth (''I wouldn't want to be on stage for the sake of it'').
Would she welcome a return to America?
''I don't think so, despite being seen as exotic and very
English-sounding over there. When I did MTV auditions, they said: 'You
tested really well, we were surprised . . . women on TV come over as
types, either bitchy or stuck-up or sexy, but you came over with the
buddy quality that men have.
''And I'm saying: 'Hey, but wasn't I a little bit sexy?' But really
the buddy quality is the one to aim for. The aim of being on TV is to
communicate, not to put up barriers.''
Have you a message for your devotees north of the Border?
''Keep your snowballs on display . . . I'll be back!''
Phoo-er, young missy-buddy. A proud and obliging Schcotland will keep
its schnowballs mightily pumped up and for your eyes only.
* The Entertainment Superhighway begins on Radio 5 Live on Friday,
April 21, at 10.05pm.

BRITISH computer geeks, superhighway trekkies, and infobahn groupies
have much to celebrate this month with the news that Wired, the
cult-status American computer monthly magazine, is launching in the UK.
The magazine calls itself the ''mouthpiece of the digital generation''
and its in-your-face approach to technology is mega-popular with
supercool types from Toledo to Tokyo, and now Tighnabruaich, too, who
can zap into the printed version for a hefty #3.50 per issue or catch
the online version on the world-wide web via HotWired
(http://www.hotwired.com/).
Leave it on your coffee table and you'll never again have to put up
with the boring neighbours who want to borrow your Cosmo! If, like me,
you're a fan of the more sedate and highly civilised science magazine,
Omni, you may have wondered at its non-appearance on the news-stands
this month. Alas, it too has forsaken paper and gone for the on-line
electronic alternative. Trouble is, you can't take your screen to the
smallest room in the house for a good long read. Scratch that, the
Japanese are working on it!

* DOCTORS will soon be able to diagnose many types of cancer quickly
and accurately using a special ''torch'' being developed in the US. The
new technique, which was unveiled at the Institute of Physics Annual
Congress in Telford last week, is known as optical biopsy and it has
been undergoing clinical tests in a number of US medical centres.
Around 70% of cancers show up near the surface of an organ such as the
bladder, colon, or stomach and with the new hand-held device doctors
will be able to shine light on to areas where cancer is suspected. Light
is sent to a possible cancer site using an optical fibre, either via an
endoscope or catheter and the way that light is reflected can determine
whether the tissue is cancerous.
''Light enters the tissue and is scattered back out, in just the same
way as you see when you hold your finger over a small torch,'' said Dr
Irving Bigio of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.
''Malignant tissue very clearly affects the colour of the light and a
doctor can get an instant reading about the area he or she is touching
with the fibreoptic probe.''
Researchers are now working on a more invasive version for detecting
cancer in areas such as the breast and pancreas where the optical fibre
could be inserted using a needle.
* THE OFFICE of Science and Technology has launched a competition to
find the best primary and secondary science schools in the UK. ''Despite
our heritage, science is undervalued,'' said David Hunt, Cabinet
Minister for Science. ''There is a gulf between what our top scientists
are achieving and society's general lack of awareness of how important
science is to all our lives. Children have a natural curiosity -- they
are by nature investigative scientists and I hope that many of the
excellent schools in Scotland will take part in this national
competition.''
Kathleen Hamill, the head teacher at Ladeside Primary School in
Larbert, is confident that Scottish schools will give a good account of
themselves. ''Given Scotland's history of producing world-class
inventors, I have no doubt that there is a budding Logie Baird or James
Watt sitting in one of our classrooms today,'' she said.
Classes will be invited to submit video films or photo-essays showing
why they think theirs is the best science school in the UK. Winners will
receive #1000 for equipment for their school plus a trip to any hands-on
science centre of their choice. Closing date for entries is July 31.
Details and rules are available from: Science School of the Year Awards,
Office of Science and Technology, Room 3/9, Albany House, 84-86 Petty
France, London SWIH 9ST.
* BAYSDAYS are a fairly new concept in Scotland. Basically, they are
''away days'' for young people (and their parents) to learn more about
science and technology via hands-on experience and demonstrations and
they are run by the Youth Section of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science -- hence the rather peculiar name.
For the first time, BAYS has got together with the Scottish branch of
the Association for Science Education and it is holding its first
workshop -- aimed at 8-13 year olds -- from 10am to 4pm next Thursday at
Bannockburn High School in Stirling.
The subject for the day is ''Making things work'' and activities
include designing, building, and testing bridges; experimenting with
cogs and wheels and investigating pulley power.
Further details are available from organiser Liz Robertson on 0224

SCIENTISTS throughout the world have spent years searching for a cure
for the common cold, but the advent of supercomputers may help
researchers fathom the mysteries of the many viruses that cause a
full-blown dose of the sniffles.
Pharmaceutical scientists have discovered the atomic structure of an
enzyme that plays a vital role in the life cycle of a rhinovirus and
this should make it possible to design a drug, atom by atom, that will
lock into the enzyme and inhibit or stop rhinovirus replication.
However, each rhinovirus and cold virus is minutely different, meaning
that each would require its own vaccine, but by using powerful computing
tools the chances of hitting the right combination are greater because
large numbers of calculations can be tried out simultaneously and
speedily.
Professor Eddy Liew, Professor of Immunology at the University of
Glasgow, said: ''Although it will be some years before such a drug might
be on the market, computers will be of great help in the continuing
search for a cure.'' Meantime, as the world sneezes on, waiting for the
technology-driven version of the mustard bath, sufferers spend a fortune
on over-the-counter ''remedies'', in a global market worth about #3.5bn
a year.

Yvonne Wightman begins this week's column on technology and new
developments with a look at the Edinburgh science festival
THERE is still time to catch some of the terrific science events at
the Seventh Edinburgh International Science Festival, which is the
biggest event of its kind and which runs until April 17.
Today, for example, you can learn about Chinese science, or plants
that provide clues to new medicines. On Sunday there is the structure of
the universe and telescopes of the future. Throughout the rest of the
week you can choose from dinosaurs, a cybercafe, the Ulysses spacecraft,
space junk, the networked home, physics, vitamins, plus a range of
mind-boggling exhibits and demonstrations.
Many of the events are free, some have a small entry charge; science
for ''grown-ups'' is well covered with many internationally-renowned
speakers offering free lectures and demos, and children's events include
a Starlab and space show and fully supervised scientific workshops.
What about some DIY science kits available via mail order? Since its
launch last year, the Festival's Blueprint range of science kits has
chalked up more than 6000 orders from all over the UK and Europe. Little
horrors will kill for the scabs, wounds, imitation blood, and alien skin
from a Movie Make-Up pack; make your own crystals from salt and sugar.
You can also make your own optical illusions, or try a MADLAB beginner
or advanced kit.
Details of the kits, which range in price from just under #3 to #8,
are available from the Science Shop, 1 Broughton Market, Edinburgh EH3
6NU (tel 0131 556 6446).
The full  programme of events can be accessed on the Internet via the
world-wide web on: http//www.ed.ac.uk/edinfo/maincity.htmL.  Or use
email on esfatfestival.ed.ac.uk.  Those of us who still live in the
steam-driven age can use the telephone to dial up the box-office general
inquiries line on 0131 557 4296.
Through the Outreach Programme, supported by the Scottish Office, the
Science Festival can provide help and advice for anyone thinking of
running their own science jamboree.  Complete events and travelling
exhibitions are available.  Ring 0131 556 6446 for details.

We heard songs from
the great tunesmiths,
but not always the
well-known or
the expected songs
A cabaret singer of the highest quality goes
back to his roots, and Ken Gallacher
feels privileged to have been in the audience
WHEN Bobby Short was growing up, when, indeed, he was something of a
child prodigy, he hung out with members of the Ellington band. He met
Fats Waller and a little later played opposite Nat King Cole and his
idol, Art Tatum. He even shared a dressing room at New York's Blue Angel
with Mildred Baillie.
And yet, for all his immersion in jazz, Short's career took a
different turn. He became New York's cabaret singer par excellence. And
for more than quarter of a century he has performed at the Carlyle, an
elegant East side hotel on Madison Avenue.
There are occasions, however, that the jazzer in him breaks through.
The songs he sings, for instance, are often those favoured by jazz
musicians, the pick of the Great American Songbook.
Then, too, Short has made occasional records away from his usual trio
setting. One, back in the fifties, featured such
jazzmen-turned-studio-stalwarts as trumpeter Yank Lawson and trombonist
Louis McGarity .
Then, two years ago, Short issued a CD with the Howard Alden, Dan
Barrett group. That must have given him a special pleasure with a group
reminding him of the music he grew up with, playing clever, tight
arrangements that brought back memories of the John Kirby sextet .
The album must have given Short a real taste, again, for the music of
his youth, because the other month he cut a follow-up CD. It was
different, because it was done on his home territory, in the Cafe
Carlyle, in front of an invited audience.
Some of the same musicians were there, but guitarist Alden and
trombonist Barrett were missing; Alden because of contractual reasons --
although he did the arrangements -- and Barrett because he was working
out of town.
However, for two nights and four special sessions, Short performed
with Warren Vache on coronet, Bucky Pizzarelli on guitar, along with
Chuck Wilson on alto and clarinet, Frank Tait on bass, and Jacky
Williams on drums.
I was there for the opening session, part of an audience that packed
the small room where Short has held court for so long. His friends,
Carlyle regulars, musicians wanting to share in this live recording,
attended.
What we heard was a celebration of New York, the city that has adopted
Bobby Short, the precocious kid from Danville, Illinois, whose singing
and piano-playing have become a landmark of the city.
We heard songs from the great tunesmiths, but not always the well
known or expected songs. There was one by Cole Porter I had never heard
before. Another from Rodgers and Hart that I can't recall.
But, always, the songs were good, and were performed with Short's
impeccable talent. He has always, throughout his career, picked up
little-known, even unknown gems. On the session I heard, he did the
same.
He started off with the Cole Porter number, When Love Bloomed on 52nd
Street -- a little remembrance of Swing Street where so many of Shorts
idols played in the forties. Then it was Rodgers and Hart moving into
the spotlight with Way Out West on West End Avenue, with marvellous
guitar from the man Short introduced as ''the legendary Buckie
Pizzarelli.''
Johnny Mercer's Harlem Butterfly then arrived to segue seemlessly into
Duke Ellington's Black Butterfly; inevitably in any Short performance
there is a song by Duke. Sy Coleman was honoured next with My Private
Property, and then it was Harry Warrens turn with She's a Latin from
Manhattan.
Short followed with a more dramatic penthouse serenade and finished
with an out-and-out jazz version of Broadway with a swinging, clever,
and marvellous arrangement by Howard Alden.
The setting was perfect for Short. It evoked memories from his past.
It put him into a jazz setting that he clearly enjoys. Certainly, it's
different from what he would normally do at the Carlyle. There he does
sing Cole Porter, and Rogers and Hart, and Jerome Kern, but he also
performs Noel Coward and Ivor Novello songs.
There was no room for these on the night I heard him. This was Short
in jazz mode, this was Short perhaps remembering his youth when he
listened to Tatum and worshipped at his shrine.
This was Short remembering Ellington and the musicians he hung out
with in the 40s.
This was Short doing something he enjoys, something that was with him
long before he listened to Mabel Mercer and Hildegarde and moved into
cabaret and the success that has brought him.
I look forward to the CD being issued. I look forward to hearing again
Vache's solo on Black Butterfly and Short singing those Al Dubin's
lyrics to She's a Latin from Manhattan.
It's an issue worth waiting for.

By their album collection
ye shall know them.
Introducing Keith Moore,
the Fidelity Inspector, who
visits Kirsty Wark in
the first of a new series
IN one breath she said: ''You like a coffee? I heard Prince played at
the Garage the other night, I wish I'd seen that.'' I knew I was with a
woman who knew her music. I liked the way she said Prince. It was
concise, straight to the point, so right.
Forget Symbol, Squiggle, or Slave. Prince is Prince is Prince. Which
is only as you would expect from Kirsty Wark, the interviewer the
politicians really fear the most.
So what sounds rock the house of Wark and her husband, Alan Clements?
Like many folk with young children, they discovered early on -- when son
James was found swinging on the open disc drawer of a newly-bought CD
player -- that kids are fascinated by music.
The CD player was beyond repair, so Wark designed and commissioned a
protective oak cabinet to house hi-fi, CDs, tapes, and vinyl. What lies
within is a Q magazine readers' dream: Neil Young, Alex Chilton, Talking
Heads, Costello, The Doors -- every one a modern classic.
The first record she bought was Dead End Street by The Kinks (which
she still has), followed by either Dylan's The Times They Are A Changin'
or The Monkees' eponymous debut. Whatever it was, it cost 32/6d and came
from Campbell's in Kilmarnock.
''It was an electrical store, but in the back they had these listening
booths where you could sample the latest sounds. We would hang out there
of a Saturday afternoon, pretending we had the money to buy something.
We rarely did.''
Of her school days she says: ''The coolest thing you could do was to
wander around with a copy of a Leonard Cohen, Buffalo Springfield, or
Stones album under your arm.''
The Stones became a preoccupation with the young Wark. She blagged her
way into the Apollo after turning up with tickets for the wrong night,
and her greatest vinyl loss was a copy of Beggar's Banquet with its
original white gatefold sleeve. ''That one, and a great many others,
went the way of all flesh,'' she laughs. (Inspector's note: it is a well
known fact that the break-up of any relationship causes serious damage
to your record collection).
Arriving in Glasgow in 1977, Kirsty Wark discovered New Wave. The
proof is there in a box of 7-inch singles: X-Ray Spex, Graham Parker, a
pile of old Stiff label collectibles..
I grew suspicious of this impossibly-respectable record collection,
thinking that she'd hidden the embarrassing bits in the hall cupboard
before I'd arrived. But no, she assured me, nothing had been removed.
Still, among the Joni Mitchell, Bowie, Van Morrison, and The Velvet
Underground, there were a few horrors. Gilbert O'Sullivan? Kirsty Wark
owns (though claims it's her brother's) a copy of his Get Down. There's
also a Lindisfarne album (''Alan's'') and a single by Marilyn, friend to
Boy George (''It's great for parties'').
Of current music, she confesses: ''We don't buy much anymore''. She
namechecks Portishead while talk of Annie Lennox's album of cover
versions elicits: ''I've not heard it, but it sounds too easy for her,
the same way that Bryan Ferry's cover albums were, you know, a little
disappointing.''
ELECTING to play a track from Lennox's Diva, she finds the CD is not
in its case. ''Could be the children have taken it,'' she says. ''It's
probably lost or broken by now.''
Wark would surely agree: housing a music collection under the same
roof as children proves only that rock' n 'roll isn't really for the
kids.

Andrew MacKay avoids having his skull split
by a potent local brew before sampling a prize
winner from the man who has gone back to nature
WHEN Roger White boasts that his brewery is the best in the Orkney
Islands, he does not intend to portray the image of a man affected by
conceit; his aim is more roguish. He is, in fact, the sole nominee for
that award. The Orkney Brewery is also Britain's most northerly.
White first called on Orkney several years ago and was so much taken
by the island's beauty that he bought the old schoolhouse in Quoyloo. It
was his intention to return one day and settle.
His work as a civil engineer took him to the Middle East, and it was
while toiling under the blistering sun in Iraq that inspiration visited
him and the yearning to convert the schoolhouse into a brewery became
his ambition. A strange calling, perhaps, as there was only a vestige of
barley and malt in his blood.
White's sole flirtation with brewing had been almost 30 years earlier
when, as a licensee, he worked for Donnington Brewery in
Gloucestershire. He has fond memories of that time and recalls the
idyllic beauty of the brewery with its old waterwheel. Had White been
smitten with some romantic notion that had manifested itself from his
sub-consciousness, or was his vocation really to turn the old
schoolhouse into a brewery?
He packed in his job and returned to Britain. The Ringwood Brewery in
Hampshire was to be his home, and for the next three weeks he ate,
drank, and slept brewing. Almost disrespectfully he implied that there
was nothing to setting up a brewery -- ''just a few big tanks and a lot
of pipes joined together''.
Ringwood sold him some equipment to get started, and he began building
his chemistry set in the old schoolhouse. He continued to read books on
brewing and learn all he could about the secrets of a good pint. And
produce one he did. In 1988, Raven Ale was the first baby from Quoyloo;
brewed naturally without chemicals, the beer has a flavour that is not
unlike traditional English beer without the extra hoppiness.
White appeared to have been blessed with instant success. He had not
introduced a mystical ingredient to his brew, merely adopted a
level-headed approach. He reasoned that by buying the best quality
barley and Scottish malt he would produce a beer of a fine pedigree.
He was quite content with what he was doing, and had no plans to
produce another type of ale until he was approached, in 1989, and asked
to make a beer for the Grampian Beer Festival. The result was
Skullsplitter, a seriously potent ale that has an ABV of 8.5%. Such is
the demand for this traditional winter-strength beer that it is brewed
all year round, and on occasion Skullsplitter goes to Birmingham to be
fitted with a glass waistcoat.
There was no holding back White, and after acquiring a partner, Irene,
in marriage and business, he created what was to be the brewery's
biggest seller, Dark Island, a Scottish beer with lots of flavour and
reasonable strength at 4.6% ABV. This beer now accounts for 60% of the
brewery's output.
Dragonhead completes the range from Quoyloo. It is a stout made from
an old Irish recipe and was introduced in 1992. With an ABV of 4.0% it
is at the same fighting weight as its competitors. Curiously, it has
found popularity among stout drinkers in the North of England and
accounts for about 5% of the brewery's output, it too being bottled.
The beers from the Orkney Brewery have featured in prize-lists at beer
festivals around the country. In 1991 Raven Ale made it to the final of
the Great British Beer Festival in Brighton; in Peterborough, the
country's second biggest beer festival, it was voted best beer. Other
honours include first, second, and fourth places in Jersey, and its
beers were given second place by Camra last year.
When the Raven lands it does not linger long, and by the time the bush
telegraph stirs into action it has usually flown. However, a recent
#250,000 investment has given the Orkney Brewery the facility
substantially to increase output, perhaps giving us time to get the bird
in our sights.
Pint to ponder
* Maclay is keeping its fighting spirit going with the recent
introduction of Broadsword, a cask-conditioned beer that follows Wallace
India Pale Ale, launched six months ago. Broadsword is available at the
Three Judges, Glasgow, and the Wally Dug, Edinburgh. It is a
full-bodied, golden ale, fruity with a hoppy nose and a long lingering
finish, and has a cutting edge of 3.8% ABV.

Tired but happy, Jeremy Duncan returns
from France with cases of wine and the
avowed intention to go back yet again
THE British, let's face it, have always had double standards when it
comes to wine. We like to think we know our grape varieties and
vintages, yet most of us, if we're honest, have a better nose for the
price and the label than the actual bouquet. And why not?
It is one of the tragedies of our national life that many of the
cheaper wines quaffed with gusto by millions of sensible French are
regarded with disdain in this country because of the British cult of the
wine buff. For the difference between everyday wine across the Channel
and the Friday night Fitou from Safeway lies not in the quality, but in
the price, which is quite simply doubled by the imposition of excise
duty at #1.05 and VAT at 17.5%.
Thus it was that my wife and I made our first, unsuccessful attempt to
tap into the great French wine lake. Towards the end of our 1993 holiday
it became increasingly obvious that instead of the 180 litres with which
the Government saw fit to entrust us, we were going to be hard pushed to
squeeze 10 litres into a boot already overflowing.
Never mind, we thought, if we can't take it with us we'll have it sent
later. Amicable negotiations then ensued with a village vintner, selling
velvet-smooth VDQS at only seven francs a litre from what looked
worryingly like a petrol pump. These arrangements, continued later by
fax from Scotland, were abruptly terminated when HM Customs and Excise
pointed out that duty had to be paid on all unaccompanied wine imports.
The final assault on the British fiscal fortifications, now clearly
necessitating a personal trip across the Channel with an empty car, took
place over a long weekend last month. A special 24-hour Hull-Zeebrugge
return trip by North Sea Ferries should have allowed me a full six hours
in Calais had bad weather while crossing and poor directions not
curtailed this to three.
However, I eventually found the Marcel Doret retail park (at Junction
3 off the motorway leading from the car ferry terminal) where there are
three large wine warehouses. The first, Pidou, was thoroughly
depressing; puddles of liquid on bare concrete floors, crates of
apparently reject wine and beer being picked over by eagle-eyed
foreigners.
Yet judging by the number of British cars and coaches parked outside,
this was obviously the most popular of the three. Plenty of wine for
less than 10 francs a bottle, a wide range of beers, and even baguettes
and plastic-wrapped cheeses for anyone desperate enough for a quick fix
of France.
The second warehouse, the Calais Wine and Beer Company, was
British-staffed and had the friendly chaotic feel of a High Street
Oddbins, This, too, was busy to the extent that there were insufficient
trolleys, the unlucky customers having to queue with only what they
could carry.
With the time and physical strength for only one crate, I progressed
to Perardel, the quietest and most French in ambience. This was the only
establishment where a ''degustation'' was openly offered and where
10-litre wine boxes were on sale. These ranged in price from 118 francs
for a red Vaucluse -- remarkably pleasant drinking -- to 166 francs for
a Cotes du Rhone, now in our cellar for broaching later.
The trip home was uneventful, although accompanied by the tinkling of
glass against glass. The Customs officers at Hull failed to raise a
single eyebrow at a lone male in a laden car gingerly approaching their
sleeping policemen. I had anticipated at the very least having to argue
my way back into Britain, as earlier phone conversations with officials
at Hull and Dover had revealed a legal grey area about personal wine
imports.
In a nutshell, the 90-litre limit is only a guideline; legally you can
bring home as much as you want, providing it is genuinely for your own
use. On the other hand, Dover Customs hinted obliquely that they could
require evidence that any quantity exceeding the guidelines was intended
purely for home consumption -- which, short of videoing every glass you
drink, is practically impossible to provide.
For me, the trip was worth it. Tiring, yes, but also exhilarating, and
the North Sea Ferries experience, with comfortable cabin and first-class
food, was a real pleasure. The total cost of fares and petrol set
against the duty saved on my 130 litres left a notional profit of about
#35.
As the car could easily have taken several more wine boxes, the
potential savings, even travelling from Scotland, are around #100. The
only caveat, of course, is the life-span of the wine, with unopened wine
boxes in general remaining drinkable for about 10 months. Don't buy more
than you think you can drink.
I will repeat the journey in a couple of years or so, but with one
major difference. Next time I will buy my wine where the French buy
theirs -- from Mammouth, Leclerc, or any other ordinary supermarket. As
the Mammouth manager explained over the phone, their prices were as
cheap as, if not cheaper than, the British-orientated wine emporiums I
had just been to. And next time I shall go on a Monday, when the
supermarkets are open.

The interior of the
restaurant is cosy,
resembling the
busy kitchen of
a well-run house
Fins Restaurant, Fairlie
THE whole subject of eating-out guides is a vexing one; they are
either full of hyperbole on the excellence of the food, or the chef, or
there is no method of classification, leaving the reader wondering just
how good or bad a place really is.
Ask a chef his, or her, opinions on guidebooks and you may well have
to take cover. Forget the hyperbole, expletives are more in order. For
the most part, chefs agree that inclusion can boost custom, but not
markedly so, and that descriptions of the food served are often left
wanting. What they would really like to see is a guide written by chefs.
Of course, they would say that. But I wonder just how many of them
would want to be judged by their friends and cohorts? It might mean a
lot of back-slapping and little criticism; after all, who really wants
to berate his next-door neighbour? It might even make entertaining
reading, but would it make it easier for the hungry traveller, who just
wants somewhere half-decent to eat? I am yet to be convinced.
I always carry a copy of the Taste of Scotland guide when I travel
around. My main beef is the lack of classification. There is a guideline
on price but, as we all know, this is a guide to nothing. You do not
always get what you pay for; frequently you get less. What the guide
lacks is any indication of just how good or bad a place is.
The strengths of most places are mentioned, but faults are not. I am
not advocating the percentage style of Egon Ronay or the marks out of
five in The Good Food Guide, but more balance would be good. Few places
do everything well, so why not say that? Consumers want reliable
information.
I decided to test the theory and plucked a restaurant from the 1995
edition of Taste of Scotland, choosing Fins Restaurant in Ayrshire,
which received a glowing recommendation. Directions seemed vague, and as
I sped along the darkened A78 through Largs and on to Fairlie, I was
certain I had missed a cut-off. The guide said the restaurant is a mile
south of Largs -- it was, in fact, several miles. However, it does sit
right on the A78, so I found it.
The restaurant is a series of low, whitewashed buildings. The smell of
smoke was pungent in the dark night . . . and my companion expressed
concern that dinner was burning. I was excited by the fact that Fins
must be smoking its own fish, and this added greatly to the appeal of
eating there. Home-made was, for once, an apt description.
The interior of the restaurant is cosy, resembling the busy kitchen of
a well-run house. Photographs of fishing boats and fishermen adorn the
walls; customers sit round sturdy wooden tables, and candlelight burns
low; fish is everywhere and in numerous guises, as wind chimes,
ornaments, and a large menu board.
I was intrigued that one of the dishes, smoked haddock topped with
cheese, was attributed to London chef Gary Rhodes. Cynically, I thought
this was another example of chefs patting one another on the back. The
owner, however, informed me that she had been cooking a dish like this
for years, but because she was using Rhodes's recipe, she felt she
should let her customers know.
Not surprisingly, the menu is made up of locally-landed fish and
seafood, although fillet steak and vegetarian dishes are prepared on
request. Rather than choose from the extensive menu, I asked the
waitress, who was also the owner, for her recommendation. She settled on
moules mariniere to start and Jura monkfish tails to follow.
The mussels were served steaming in a huge bowl, a mountainous
portion. I was impressed by the size, but not by the actual mussels,
many of which were woefully small and possibly harvested too early. A
piece of chunky, home-made bread dunked in the stock offered up a
delicious combination of garlic, onion, tarragon, Chardonnay, and cream.
Most satisfying.
I enjoy communal eating, and salmon, so helped myself to some of my
companion's salmon trio comprising hot and cold smoked salmon and
gravadlax. Very good.
The kitchen area looked small and frantic. The restaurant, which sat
around 36, was not full, but was busy. This meant waiting between
courses, but I felt reassured that this also meant dishes were being
cooked to order.
The monkfish tails were served in a cream and leek sauce, with the
distinctive flavour of Pernod coming through. The fish was meaty and
firm, with a good flavour. But I did feel that a simpler sauce would
have been more complementary, so I could easily have done without the
Pernod.
On the other hand, my companion, who had chosen plaice stuffed with
squat lobster tails, raved about the fish but complained that the
creamy, Chardonnay sauce was bland. Vegetables were of the predictable
sort and instantly forgettable.
Desserts consisted of a selection of home-made temptations including
sticky toffee pudding, chocolate and hazelnut truffle, and lemon tart.
The banoffi pie sounded too good not to try. It was a huge slab of
biscuit, toffee, banana, and cream; achingly sweet, but endlessly
enjoyable.
The wine-list is not extensive, but includes a good selection of
whites and a couple of reds. The house white is a dry, fruity, unoaked
Chardonnay from Slovakia and is good value at #8.80.
It had been a hugely enjoyable evening, in very comfortable
surroundings, with reasonably good food, one of the better choices I
have made from a guidebook. In the past I have made some very bad ones
where I have felt ripped-off.
Eating-out guides are not conclusive evidence of whether or not a
restaurant is good or bad. My cynicism about them hardened recently when
a chef told me his restaurant has appeared in some, but he had never
knowingly been inspected. Worse still, a restaurateur even admitted to
writing his own entry for one of the guides.
Guides are supposed to take the hard work out of looking for a good
restaurant, but they are not always reliable. In future, I shall ask
around; other people's opinions are usually a better indication of good
food at good prices.
* Fins Restaurant, Fencefoot Farm, Fairlie (by Largs). Tel: 01475

THIS small restaurant has an almost Mediterranean feel, but the menu
is quite definitely Scottish. Fish and seafood dominate, but there is
also a good choice of venison, prime beef, and vegetarian. Recent
highlights have included warm pigeon breast served with diced pear and a
walnut salad, and seafish in a saffron and herb cream. Desserts are
tempting; the creme brulee is certainly worth a try, and the caramelised
lemon tart is memorable. The restaurant operates a BYOB, with a small
charge for corkage. The cost of an evening out is very competitive.
Open for dinner from 5.30, Monday to Saturday. Three courses cost
around #16.

Celebrating that special event can be made easier when
you plan ahead, lighten up, and make sure there are no
last-minute hitches. Lady Claire Macdonaldoffers
a topping, tempting idea to keep all the family happy
EASTER is a celebration in itself, but so often there are other happy
events around the same time. Christenings, confirmations, and first
communions are are all occasions that are followed by a party for the
celebrants and their families and friends. This means thinking about
what to feed your guests.
The answer, as ever, is to keep it simple and don't attempt anything
that will need last-minute attention or take up more time in preparation
than you have available.
Several years ago I was asked to write a book for Harrods on the theme
of entertaining. Some of the ideas for the content were left entirely to
me, but some came from the people who had asked me to do the book.
We didn't always agree, but there was one item that seemed absurd to
me, and I couldn't change their minds or make them see sense; so it
remains in print in the book, and I blush whenever I think about it.
It is the christening lunch that takes three days in preparation. I
tried to point out that no new mother has that amount of time to give
over to making lunch for the christening -- and especially not if she
has other young children besides the baby.
With four children, I remember vividly each christening, and the first
was the easiest, the second the worst, with the third coming a close
second. The fourth was much easier, because by then our two older girls
were of an age to be of some help.
But a really good lunch needn't involve endless preparation, nor to my
way of thinking need it involve a wide selection of dishes. Keep the
menu planning simple, do what you can in advance, and accept all offers
of help that come your way -- I often think we all tend to be too proud
when help is offered, and afraid to be thought of as not being able to
cope.
For a christening, but also for some people for a confirmation and a
first communion, a celebration cake is needed. There is a feeling among
some that any such delicacy should be fruit cake.
I love them, but they are undeniably heavy, and if you opt for an
altogether lighter cake it can do double duty as the pudding. The
following recipe for a lemon-flavoured cake has a buttercream filling
and a very simple white icing.
I am no expert, but even I can pipe small blobs of this icing around
the edge of the top of the cake and also around the base. Simple though
this sounds -- and is -- it does look good, and you can tie a pale
yellow ribbon round the cake. This makes a suitable celebration cake for
any confirmation or first communion, or, indeed, just for an Easter
cake. If you are intending it for a christening cake, you can put a
small glass or silver vase or container in the middle with a few small
and suitable fresh flowers in it.
Cake is filling, and this one, even though it contains no fruit, has a
generous buttercream; a slice makes a perfect finale for a celebration
lunch.
This amount makes a large 10-inch diameter cake with two layers. If
you want to get ahead with your preparations you can make the cake and
freeze the two layers, filling and icing it, once thawed, the day before
the occasion.
I think it is so important to use good butter for the buttercream. No
matter how simple the cake, especially when it is destined for such a
special event, the best ingredients should be used.
I like to use unsalted butter, for the buttercream anyway, and
preferably for the cake, too. Some butters, for me, have a taste that
doesn't enhance the end result because they seem to be predominant over
even the lemon. It must seem such a small point to some people, but,
believe me, it makes the world of difference.
Lemon Celebration Cake
Butter two 10-inch round cake tins and line the base of each with a
disc of baking parchment
For the cake:
10oz butter, unsalted or as lightly salted as possible
10oz caster sugar
6 large eggs, beaten
10oz self-raising flour
grated rind and juice of two lemons
For the buttercream filling:
6oz unsalted butter
6oz icing sugar, sieved
grated rind one lemon
For the icing:
2 egg whites
1lb sieved icing sugar
juice of [1/2] lemon
BEAT the butter well, gradually adding the caster sugar and beating
both together till pale and fluffy. Beat in the eggs alternately with
spoonfuls of the sieved flour. Lastly, beat in the lemon rinds and
juice. Divide the mixture between the two prepared tins and smooth
evenly, making a slight dip in the centre of each. Bake in a moderate
oven -- 350[DEG]F, gas mark 4, 180[DEG]C -- for 30-35 minutes until the
cake is just beginning to come away from the sides of the tins. Take the
cakes out of the oven, leave for a few minutes in their tins, then turn
them out on to wire cooling racks and leave to cool completely.
Make the buttercream by beating the butter well, gradually adding the
sieved icing sugar. Beat till light and fluffy, and lastly beat in the
grated lemon rind.
Put one of the cakes on a serving plate or tray and spread it with the
buttercream. Cover it with the remaining cake.
TO MAKE THE ICING: beat the whites, but only till they are frothy, not
too stiff. Then, with a wooden spoon (as opposed to an electric whisk)
beat in the sieved icing sugar. Beat in the lemon juice. Have ready a
deep jug of near-boiling water, and a large spatula to dip into the
water. Spread the icing over the cake, smoothing it carefully around the
sides. Only smooth it where you feel it is necessary; it is tempting to
go on and on. Leave the cake for a few hours before piping, with a small
fluted piping nozzle, small, even-sized blobs around the edge of the
surface and around the base of the cake. Leave to dry.

John Fowler has a preview of the house beside the Abbey and comes away
mightily impressed
WHEN you get Elspeth King and Michael Donnelly, you get more than you
bargained for. Julian Spalding of Glasgow Art Galleries discovered that
when he inherited them along with the People's Palace. Dunfermline
Heritage Trust discovered it when they appointed King as director and
Donnelly came along too.
What the trust hoped for was a straightforward, swift, uncomplicated,
and cheap transformation of Abbot House, an old stone town house close
to Dunfermline Abbey, into a conventional heritage-cum-information
centre. The brief they gave King was simple. No fancy work. No
structural alterations. No archaelogy.
Don't dig, they said. King thought otherwise. She dug, or at least she
persuaded the trust against their better judgment that digging should
take place. As a result a small trove of domestic objects -- and a
number of skeletons -- was unearthed below street level.
Don't touch the wallpaper, they said. Donnelly touched. He picked at
the woodchip, pick, pick, pick, curling up the corners with increasing
boldness.
Don't remove the plasterboard -- heigh-ho, the plasterboard came away,
revealing the wartime mural that Elspeth King refers to in her article
on this page. And so it went on. Find after find, including windows,
alcoves, fireplaces, unsuspected detail. King's work established that
the house did in fact date before Reformation times and it was indeed
where abbots of Dunfermline lived.
It will be no surprise that the opening of Abbot House has been a
little retarded. The date was originally scheduled for last year but
that had to be put back. And even when the doors open on Friday, not
everything will be finished in time and work will still go on.
I benefited from a King and Donnelly tour, along with film maker
Murray Grigor, who will include a section on Abbot House in a
forthcoming documentary he is directing for Scottish Television. The
public will not be so fortunate. King has been officially away from
Abbot House since she was appointed director of the Smith Art Gallery in
Stirling early last year, though she can't keep her finger out of the
pie and is still actively involved (unpaid). Donnelly's stint as project
officer ends once Abbot House is complete and a newly appointed manager
takes over.
Over one stone fireplace, a old motto has been carved:
Sen word is thrall and thocht is free
Keep weil thy tongue I counsel thee.
This is not advice that King and Donnelly have followed. Their
inability to hold their tongues -- and consequent dismissal from the
Glasgow art gallery scene -- has worked to Dunfermline's advantage.
Even with many of the rooms still bare, as they were on my visit last
month, the exciting nature of the project came across strongly. There
are nooks and crannies, winding stone stairs, peekaboo glimpses through
stained glass at the splendid pile of the abbey just across the way.
Colour abounds: in Alasdair Gray's ceiling painting, a kind of history
tree showing the main events in the Dunfermline story, and in the
Virginia Colley mural illustrating Robert Henryson's Testament of
Cresseid.
Unlike his predecessor Chaucer, in his Troilus and Criseyde, Henryson
takes the story to a desperately sad conclusion. Thus Colley's wall
painting shows poor Cresseid suffering from leprosy (which was then
thought to be sexually transmitted). Ironically, in her distress she
sees her erstwhile lover passing by, but neither recognises the other
and Cresseid dies a lonely death. It's a further irony -- not lost on
Elspeth King -- that Scottish students are more familiar with the
Chaucer version than with Henryson's. Abbot House redresses the balance.
Here, too, is the fragment of ancient mural newly uncovered. Most of
the colour has faded away, but it is to be restored. King and Donnelly
believe it may refer to the Henryson poem, and that the house in the top
right-hand corner represents Troy -- although, as King says, ''it's a
Fife hoose with red pantiles on the roof''.

Under a patina of woochip, panelled doors and concrete floors lay a
forgotten remnant of Scotland's history. Elspeth King recalls how its
restoration enlisted major artists and master craftsmen -- not to
mention the resources of Glasgow's Barrows -- and brought back a measure
of local pride as well as uncovering a national treasure
ROBERT Henryson, Schoolmaster of Dunfermline, and Scotland's greatest
medieval poet, tells the fable of the Cock and the Jasp. A cock,
scratching on a dungheap, uncovers a precious priceless jewel, but
because he cannot eat it, he tosses it away, as worthless.
The fable is a metaphor for Abbot House, which opens to the public on
Friday, except that the jewel has been rescued, polished, and set in its
rightful place, as a means of restoring local pride and attracting
visitors to Dunfermline.
The work programme has taken almost three-and-a-half years, and was
not as straightforward as it seems in retrospect.
I started work on the project in November 1991, with my partner
Michael Donnelly, as a means of escape from the long-running ''Elspeth
King Affair''.
The brief was to convert Abbot House into a Heritage Centre for
Dunfermline, as quickly as possible, and as part of a new tourist
strategy to bring visitors back to Scotland's ancient capital. The house
was a gift from the Carnegie Dunfermline Trust, and came with the
promise of a funding package from Carnegie, Dunfermline District, and
Fife Region.
The first task was to prepare a business plan, but this was difficult
without investigating the structure of the building and the history of
the house. We were informed that there was nothing of interest in the
building itself. The signs were inauspicious. The concrete floors, the
neatly plasterboarded walls, the flush panelled doors, and the
ubiquitous and sanitary blue linoleum suggested that every historic
feature had been gutted in the 1964 refit. A plaque on the outside
proclaimed that the building ''was never an Abbot's House'' and had been
built after the Reformation.
A surviving fragment of a sixteenth-century wall mural was the only
historic feature left, and Michael set out with a scalpel to look for
more. Additional patches of wall mural were uncovered, but there were
other, unexpected finds. In one room, he uncovered, from under the
woodchip, a substantial 1941 mural, painted for the Air Training Corps
by artist Alan Ian Ronald, RSW (1899-1967) and this has since been fully
restored. Another part of the house had Beatles wallpaper, used as a
lining paper and pasted face to the wall. This was rescued as part of
the history of the house, for use in the displays.
Under the plasterboard, we uncovered some 17 fireplace apertures,
which had been bricked up. An important find was the remains of a
traceried window on the first floor, which helped date part of the house
to 1460, a century earlier than previously supposed.
To enable wheelchair access to the ground floor, we had to move some
of the accretions of centuries. The Maygate has risen by about
three-and-a-half feet since the 1460s, and the ground floor of Abbot
House with it. It was the perfect opportunity for an excavation. Part of
the medieval Maygate had been capsulated by a seventeenth-century
extension to the house, and new evidence was uncovered on the dietary
and sanitary habits of medieval Dunfermline in the process. An
excavation in the garden revealed a cemetery, in use between 1420 and
1440, and as the skeletons were those of children and young people, it
pertained to the town rather than the abbey.
At the end of the investigation and excavation, we had a building with
an older and much more exciting history than previously supposed.
Research in Register House and the National Library in Edinburgh put
flesh on the bones, and we were able to write the business and display
plans accordingly.
As the local museum did not want a rival organisation collecting in
the area, it became obvious at an early stage that we would have to find
furnishings and fittings for Abbot House elsewhere. We kept our Glasgow
base to facilitate shopping trips at weekends, and much of what we have
assembled to furnish the house and tell the story of Dunfermline has
come from the Barrows, and from Glasgow antique shops and warehouses.
We have had some surprising finds and incredible bargains. A cast of
the skull of Robert the Bruce and a likeness from it by Pilkington
Jackson, came from Barclay Lennie Fine Art, as did a photograph of
Jessie M King playing the role of St Margaret in a pageant.
Because of the recession, suitable furniture was available at
knockdown prices. Two reproduction seventeenth-century crown chairs,
similar to those in Dunfermline Palace, were found in Heritage House. A
seventeenth-century original chair came from Tim Wright of Bath Street.
A superb oak corner cabinet was found in a warehouse in Bridgeton.
Major ''treasures'' came from the Barrows -- linen chests, a chest of
drawers, an up-market Victorian coal bunker, various pieces of
ecclesiastical furniture, a lecturn and a 1960s cocktail cabinet in the
form of a ship's prow, which we have rechristened HMS Rosyth. Sometimes
we hired a van, but for the most part we managed to squeeze purchases
into the Ford Fiesta. The wooden fire surround which graces our
eighteenth-century display was slightly too big, but Michael went back
to the market, purchased a saw for #1, and cut it to fit.
In developing the displays, we were determined to have the best
possible quality for the house itself, and we were fortunate in having
the services of Dunfermline district's architect, Peter Ranson, who has
worked with us every step of the way.
His work, from the damp-proof course to the traditional pink harling
on the outside of the building, was quality but costly, and we found
that his programme took all of our #623,000. Much fund-raising had to be
done to raise the display money, a task undertaken by Dianne Stein of
Corporate Arts Planning.
We also worked with 20 artists and craftspeople to realise the
displays. From the 1992 RGI exhibition, we commissioned Walter Awlson to
re-interpret the long-lost head of St Margaret. We selected Phil
Johnston, head of the British Artists Blacksmiths Association, to do the
metalwork for the house. He took Henryson's poetry as his inspiration.
Glasgow artist Virginia Colley was commissioned to paint a mural scheme
illustrating Henryson's great epic poem, The Testament of Cresseid. John
Canning, who trained at the Glasgow Decorative Trades Institute in the
1960s and has built up a major decorating and conservation business in
the USA, was persuaded to marble a room, Scottish in style, of the
1690s, as an in-kind sponsorship.
George Wyllie has contributed a small, but effective sculpture --
Homage to the Lochgelly, which commemorates the tawse, so long a feature
of Scottish education. One of the biggest projects in the house was a
ceiling mural in the form of a tree of Dunfermline history, undertaken
by Glasgow artist and writer Alasdair Gray.
We aimed to have the fabric of the building beautified and at the same
time teach people something of Dunfermline's story. In one display,
Forbo-Nairn of Kirkcaldy, using their new computer cutting process, not
only cut us a simulated medieval tiled floor, but also cut into the
linoleum the names of all the kings and queens buried in Dunfermline
Abbey. In the entrance to Abbot House, where we excavated the Maygate,
they cut the shapes of the finds into an earth-brown lino, giving us, we
believe the word's first archaeological linoleum!
In the displays, which have yet to be finished, we aimed to tell the
history of the house, and give an overview of Dunfermline history, from
Pictish times to the present day, as a way of encouraging visitors to
explore the district. Mindful of the ban on collecting, we commissioned
what we could not have: the Pictish stone of Inverkeithing, last seen in
1850, was re-cut in sandstone, and the Pitfirrane Goblet, from which
King James VI drank his farewell to Dunfermline, was skilfully
replicated by master glass-blower Franco Toffolo.
The work could not have been achieved without the volunteer army who
have added the extras. Brian Dean, who during the day works as
Dunfermline's chief orthopaedic surgeon, has created a magnificent model
of the Great Michael, James IV's crusading warship. Salesman Gerry
McMullane has scripted and illustrated the story of Dunfermline Opera
House's demolition and removal to Sarasota, Florida.
Our guiding spirit throughout the project has been Sir Patrick Geddes
and his philosophy. His Dunfermline Town Plan of 1904, now a classic
text for trainee planners, was rejected out of hand at the time. Geddes
had the vision to see Abbot House as ''the Musee Cluny of Dunfermline''.
In tribute to his memory, we commissioned one of his unexecuted
sculptures for the Abbot House Garden.
While not the Musee Cluny, Abbot House is now we hope, something very
special for the people of Dunfermline and for Scotland.

* Anyone with ambitions to make a fortune writing novels should ask
their bank manager for a loan so they can invest around #8000 in this
gold-plated typewriter.
It has a good provenance, as they say, because the late Ian Fleming
commissioned it in 1952 from the Royal Typewriter Company in New York
and used it to type the final manuscript of his first James Bond novel,
Casino Royale.
He then went on to type his other Bond books on the same machine.
When Fleming first bought it, the typewriter cost $174. It is now to
be auctioned by Christie's in their South Kensington rooms on May 5.

A significant year
in the annals of
Scottish history
finds Liz Taylor
examining a lucrative
market in Jacobean
drinking glasses
IF ADVANCE publicity is anything to go by, we are in for a Jacobite
summer -- and autumn and probably winter, too, this year being the two
hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the ill-fated '45 rebellion led by
Bonnie Prince Charlie. From Kelvingrove to Culloden, from Skye to
Edinburgh's National Portrait Gallery, Jacobite exhibitions will
dominate Scottish cultural life. It will be hard not to have had a
surfeit of Stuarts by the time 1995 ends.
Cannily contriving to take advantage of the anniversary, Geoffrey B
Seddon, author, glass collector, and retired medical practitioner, has
brought out a book called The Jacobites and Their Drinking Glasses.
Such glasses are the Rolls-Royces of the antique drinking glass world,
and Seddon's book makes enthralling reading. Not only does he give his
readers a quick historical run through the events leading up to the '45,
but he includes fascinating character sketches of the main people
involved. Unlike some historians, Seddon is fairly well disposed towards
Prince Charles Edward Stuart who, he says, was confused by his terrible
childhood. His mother, Princess Clementina Sobieska, was a hysterical
religious fanatic who wreaked havoc on the psyches of both her sons.
The main target of Seddon''s book, however, is to describe the many
varieties of Jacobite glasses, to explain why they came into existence,
who made them and when, and, finally, to attempt to separate the genuine
ones from the forgeries.
The authorities hunting renegade supporters of Prince Charlie through
the Highlands, and banning the wearing of tartan, must have looked the
other way, for too much is known about the Jacobite clubs now for them
to have been a closely guarded secret at the time. Some clubs were
extremely exclusive, accepting only prominent citizens as members. One,
the Oyster and Parched Pea Club of Preston, was still in existence in
1841.
Supporters of the clubs would have used symbolic glasses for their
toasts, but various prominent Jacobite families also treasured drinking
glasses that pledged their real allegiance. The most valuable of these
are known as Amen glasses, the word ''Amen'' being included in the
decorative engraving, usually under the cipher of the Pretender.
Most of these precious glasses are now in museums, but a few are still
retained in private hands, and if one comes up for sale the glass
collecting world is thrown into a fever of excitement. The last one to
come under the hammer is what is known as the Spottiswoode Amen glass,
which Sotheby's sold in April, 1991, when it made the astonishing sum of
#66,000. It is now owned by the Drambuie Liqueur Company of Edinburgh.
Another Amen glass in private hands is at Traquair House,
Innerleithen. The fifth Earl of Traquair was sentenced to two years in
the Tower of London for taking part in the '45, and on his return home
vowed that the great gates to his property would stay closed until
another Stuart was on the throne. They are, of course, closed to this
day.
There are almost 500 Jacobite glasses in museums or private
collections in this country. They are all objects of great sentimental
value, and artistic merit, too, for they are always beautifully engraved
with traditional Jacobite symbols -- roses, thistles, portraits of
Prince Charlee, slogans, crests, verses, or dedications.
Seddon says most of them were probably made after 1750 when there was
no longer any danger of having to take to the field on behalf of the
cause. It was easier and much safer to stay at home and surreptitiously
drink the toast of the exiled Stuarts in a symbolically engraved glass.
Supporters of the Pretender in their clubs devised ways of toasting the
man they thought was the real king of Great Britain by passing their
wine glasses over glasses of water to signify that he was overseas.
It is possible that there are still gatherings where this type of
toast is made, and certainly there is a Scottish laird who gives the
traditional over-the-water toast on every anniversary of the Battle of
Culloden. Not only that, but he puts the bloodstained gauntlet of an
ancestor who died in the battle on the table at the same time.
Few, if any, of the Jacobite clubs had genuinely seditious intention,
and it is likely that they took up the cause for sentimental reasons and
as an excuse for a good party. Most members were Tories -- the Whigs
were pro-Hanoverian -- and a gathering called the Independent Electors
of Westminster was informed against in 1746 for drinking the Pretender's
health. However, nothing seems to have been done to stop it.
One chapter of Seddon's book discusses the craftsmen who possibly
executed most of the engravings. It used to be thought that, working
secretly in different parts of the country, they were responsible for
most of the glasses. Now, however, it seems likely that the majority of
Jacobite drinking glasses were produced in London and engraved by
craftsmen employed by the leading London glass merchants. The
authorities must have known about them, but were complacent since after
1745 no-one thought the Jacobite cause constituted a danger.
It is little wonder that, because of the prices they can command, such
glasses have attracted forgers. It is relatively easy to pick up genuine
eighteenth-century glass, and because a skilled engraver would not find
it too difficult to copy the stylised motifs used on real Jacobite
glasses, they have been a great temptation to the unscrupulous. Seddon
goes as far as to say that out of the 487 engraved Jacobite glasses
known to be in existence, 12.3% are probably fakes.
At the end of his book he cautions people who ''fall under the spell
of the White Rose'' and seek to possess a relic of the period in the
shape of an engraved Jacobite glass, to remember the advice ''caveat
emptor''. That is advice, he says, that would have been endorsed by the
Old, if not the Young, Pretender.

The Jazz Album (Decca)
THE other side of Shostakovich. Dmitri with a grin. A dazzling
collection of the great Russian's jazz-inspired compositions. Includes
two rollicking suites from the thirties (from elegant to oompah) the
classic Tea for Two arrangement, and the First Piano Concerto.
Stunningly characterful performances from the Royal Concertgebouw
Orchestra with Riccardo Chailly at the helm. A must, this one.
Debussy, Orchestral Music (Deutsche Grammophon)
HERE is one of the finest recordings of Debussy's classics -- La Mer,
Jeux, the Three Nocturnes, and the First Rhapsody -- that you are ever
likely to hear. Issued as a celebration of conductor Pierre Boulez's
70th birthday, they show the world's most intellectual conductor in
devastating form. Mind you, he does have the Cleveland Orchestra (is
there a finer band?) to play the stuff for him. The clarity Boulez
brings to this set will take your breath away; insights by the dozen.
And sheer, ravishing beauty of sound.

The Herald's reviewers guide you to the best in listening pleasures
Without Walls, Tammy Wynette (Sony)
* COUNTRY'S First Lady undertakes a series of finely-tempered,
lightly-chintzy duets with a disparate roster of famous dudes (Lyle
Lovett, Smokey Robinson, Aaron Neville, Elton John, Sting, and Cliff
Richard); one not-famous dude (Joe Diffie), and one well-kent femme,
Wynonna Judd. The outright winner is Tammy'n'Lyle's spare reading of
Lyle's If You Were To Wake Up, inches ahead of All I Am To You with
Aaron Neville. Durned nice, ma'am.
Subliminal Simulation, Dream Warriors (EMI Canada)
* UNJUSTLY dismissed by some as a faded blossom from rap's Daisy Age,
as initiated in 1989 by De La Soul, this is actually a pure jazz-hop
blast. Do you enjoy snaking your sacroiliac to sinuous bass-grooves?
Could you pop your puddings to propellant samples from a host of
informing sources, including Pharoah Sanders, Les McCann, Donald Byrd,
and the Pogues? Is there room for righteous rhyming in your dancefloor
reverie? In the case of the Dream Warriors, the answers can only be:
yes, yes, yes!
Routes from The Jungle, various (Virgin)
* THIS two-CD, 18-track compilation covers the four-year history of
jungle and sports wild-eyed sleeve notes which drool hotly about such
mysteries as ''entactogenic bass'', ''raw sampledelia'', ''160bpm
polypercussive darkcore'', and ''syncopated astral-fusion grooves''. A
new language befitting a new musical genre, or a reflection of a scene
which, in going too fast for the sake of going too fast, is scrambling
its own brains? A bit of both, really -- but by gum, a spot of
jungle-techno is just the job for doing the post-modern urban-dread
breakdown shimmy, grandaddio.
Double Rainbow, Joe Henderson (Verve)
* An album of Antonio Carlos Jobim's music offers a major advantage:
great tunes. Tenor saxophonist Henderson, in typically commanding form,
plays 12 bossa peaches (avoiding the obvious choices) on two sessions:
Braz and Jazz, the former light and airy with brilliant support from
pianist Eliane Elias and guitarist Oscar Castro-Neves, the latter in the
more forceful but equally compelling company of Herbie Hancock and Jack
DeJohnette. The highlight? Take your pick.
Playing with Fire, Dervish (Whirling Discs)
* Playing not just with fire but also with skill, crispness, and
attention to detail, Sligo's Dervish more than live up to the promise of
their debut album, Harmony Hill, with another collection of
imaginatively arranged tunes and a handful of songs sung in both English
and Gaelic by the winsomely unaffected Cathy Jordan.
The Final Sessions, Art Hodes (Music and Arts)
* A gem -- subtitle Americana -- from pianist Art Hodes who died last
year. Here he demonstrates that he remained as digitally dextrous in his
nineties as his days playing in Capone's Chicago speakeasies. He is
accompanied -- to glorious effect -- on some tracks by clarinettist
Kenny Davern and Kilwinning-born soprano saxophonist Jim Galloway. But
the jewel in the crown is Swanee River. Its climax -- when clarinet and
sax unite for the first time -- is utterly breathtaking.
Jazz From the Windy City (Timeless)
* COMPILATION featuring a variety of twenties Chicago bands utilising
a pool of now-legendary personnel. Best of all are the recordings by
McKenzie and Condon's Chicagoans and The Jazz Me Blues by Frank
Teschemacher's Chicagoans which embody the raw Chicago sound. Indeed,
Teschemacher's rough-edged clarinet style, a common denominator
throughout, is the real star. If you dance to even half of the 24
tracks, you'll have had a workout to remember.

YOU know that illustration of chaos theory that everyone always
quotes? The line about how the flapping of a butterfly's wings in Tibet
can lead to a hurricane over Kansas? Well, translated into human terms,
that's what Robert Altman's rich and strange multi-stranded drama Short
Cuts (retail, Artificial Eye, #13.99, cert 18, widescreen) is all about:
the way everything affects everything else, the boggling complexity of
the chain of happenstance events that conspired to get each of us to
where we are right now. Like the Talking Heads song Once In A Lifetime
says: How did I get here? It's a long story . . .
Taking nine stories and a poem by bard of bleakness Raymond Carver as
his opening bet, Altman moves the game to Los Angeles and its suburbs
and shuffles Carver's deck of characters until they're all cards in the
same dirty-poker hand. Around the central narrative of TV reporter Bruce
Davison and his wife Andie MacDowell, whose little boy is run over by a
car the day before his birthday, a score of other lives tragi-comically
collide and ricochet, from the baker (Lyle Lovett) who wants to know why
they haven't collected their son's birthday cake to Davison's father
(Jack Lemmon), constantly rerunning the videotape of memory in search of
the reason why his son doesn't love him any more.
Faithless cop Tim Robbins tries to lose the family dog, a mute but
potentially eloquent evidence of his guilty philandering; jazz singer
Annie Ross (a major and marvellous contributor to the soundtrack) rakes
over the rubble of her broken marriage; young doctor Matthew Modine
forces a confession of infidelity from his artist wife Julianne Moore;
angler's wife Anne Archer can't forgive her husband Fred Ward's
revelation that he discovered a dead woman's body on a fishing trip but
didn't bother reporting it until the three-day trip was over.
What all these people have in common is the wish that they could
rewind their lives a little and, this time, avoid taking the road that
they didn't know would lead them to where they are now. As someone says
in J M Barrie's Dear Brutus: ''They say that in the wood you get what
everyone is looking for . . . a second chance''. But not in Short Cuts.
Yet despite the pessimism of Altman's vision (not half as pessimistic,
mind you, as Raymond Carver's), Short Cuts is on the whole a comedy,
though rather a chilly one. Many of the constantly inventive and
convincingly naturalistic individual incidents are funny on their own,
sometimes hilariously so: it's only when they're all put together that
they add up to a sad but stoical portrayal of the random absurdity of
the human condition. Still, you might as well laugh. There's not much
else for it.
Despite Francis Ford Coppola's dreadful exhumation of Bram Stoker's
Dracula, there's still a vein of quality to be tapped in the vampire
genre, as witness Guillermo Del Toro's subtle and sinister Cronos
(retail, Tartan Video, #15.99, cert 18). Federico Luppi stars as an
antiquary who comes into the possession -- in more senses than one -- of
a weird, beetle-shaped golden ornament, invented by a sixteenth-century
alchemist, that confers eternal life on those who let it bite them.
Unfortunately -- always read the small print, folks -- it also turns you
into a merciless vampire.
There's an unusual degree of emotional complexity in the story of how
the benign and kindly Luppi struggles with his condition and with the
danger it poses to his near and dear (he's one of the very few screen
vampires with a conscience since Gloria Holden in 1935's Dracula's
Daughter), and a gripping thriller subplot about a ruthless and dying
millionaire's attempts to get hold of the gizmo. Visually gruesome in
spots, but just as often dreamlike and lyrical, Cronos proves there's
unlife in the undead yet.

PFITZ
Andrew Crumey
Dedalus, #7.99
IT MAY seem a hard thing to say about a good book that, ideally, it
should never have been written. After all, had it never been written,
no-one would ever know that it was any good. But Glasgow-born Andrew
Crumey's mischievous metaphysical comedy about the relationship between
stories, fiction, and (big word coming up) reality is so entirely taken
up with things conceived but never made, people invented but never born,
and stories made up never to be told, that the sheer existence of this
physical lump of paperback on my desk seems almost self-contradictory,
like Samuel Beckett's cheerful remark that ''every word is like an
unnecessary stain upon silence and nothingness''.
But Beckett said those words. And Pfitz exists. So, throwing another
contradiction on the fire, I might as well review it. Much exposition
will, I fear, be necessary. Here goes.
An eighteenth-century prince falls in love with a girl called
Margaret, who soon afterwards dies. Stricken with grief, he commands a
new city to be built as her memorial. But so detailed and precise are
the plans of Margaretenburg, and so determined is the prince that it
shall bear no possible imperfection, that its planning soon engrosses
the kingdom's whole wealth and manpower, and Margaretenburg can never be
built.
But the project has given the prince a taste for conceptual cities,
and after a few more prentice essays in the art, he conceives of the
great metropolis of Rreinstadt, the City as Encyclopaedia. The great
library of Rreinstadt will contain the knowledge of everything that can
be known, including every detail of Rreinstadt and its inhabitants and
of the library itself, a self-referential spiral to which there can be
no end.
To fill the never-to-be-built library, cartographers are engaged to
map Rreinstadt down to the interior of every room and the people in them
on every day. Biographers create the people of Rreinstadt, complete with
pasts and futures and in some cases literary careers, which involves the
creation of more people with pasts and futures . . . and at this point
my head exploded.
After running repairs had been carried out on my critical equipment, I
was able to follow the story of Schenk, a map-maker who falls in love
with a girl in the biography department. He discovers an obscure and
overlooked servant called Pfitz among the dramatis personae of
Rreinstadt and, for an excuse to talk to the girl in biography, begins
to write Pfitz's own quite unauthorised story, that of a Sancho
Panza-like valet to a stiff-necked nobleman. But this unauthorised
intervention, especially as Pfitz has stories of his own to tell,
disrupts the smooth narrative clockwork of the official version, and
soon authors and characters and the authors of authors begin to interact
in a complicated melodrama of jealousy, murder, and romantic intrigue.
Pfitz, as you can see, is not exactly a work of strict naturalism.
Andrew Crumey is having himself some fun with the artifice of literary
creation, cutting the strings that connect authors to their puppets and
letting them run around on their own. Meta-fiction, as this class of
caper is sometimes called, is however just as much an artifice -- all
fiction is artificial -- as the convention of the Godlike author, and
the small number of worthwhile books it has inspired in its long career
(you can trace it back at least as far as M R James's terrifying story
The Mezzotint) suggests that its limitations may actually be greater.
But that's not to say that it can't produce amusing and
thought-provoking novels; and, jollied along as it is by casually
interpolated shaggy-dog stories, irrelevant but imaginatively bizarre
anecdotes, philosophical puzzles, and cosy chats between Crumey and the
reader, this dense but brief fantasy is among that small but honourable
band.

Sports commentator Chick Young (right) tells
Ann Donald what's on his bedside table just now
I lOVE reading, though I just don't have the time for it during the
normal football season. I'm one of these guys who goes on holiday to
relax -- a cold beer on one side and a pile of books on the other while
I'm lying on the beach. I was an incessant reader as a kid, though. I
must have read every single Enid Blyton book published. Nowadays I'm not
a great fiction fan; it's more biographies I read. I'm also the type of
person who re-reads books like I re-watch films -- I must have seen
Gregory's Girl about 28 times now.
As regards subject matter, I've got a strange perversion for the
Vietnam War. I think to be honest, I was a child of the 60s and I was in
my formative years when the Vietnam War was happening so I was old
enough to understand the headlines that dominated the press at the time.
Maybe that's why it has had such an impact on me.
I've started reading this book called Chicken Hawk by Robert Mason
(Corgi). It's a wonderful true-life story and superbly written. He was a
Vietnam veteran and chopper pilot and it's really a very honest account
about his own part in the war, the hell he went through and the effect
on his personal life when he came back to America.
I've got a massive stock of books including a collection of bizarre
football books that I've accumulated through the years I've been working
as a sports journalist on magazines in London and Scotland. One of the
worst is by my sporting God, Pele. It's called The Beautiful Game and is
his life story written at the time of his transfer to Cosmos.
Unfortunately I think it has lost something in the translation from the
Portuguese or maybe because an American journalist who didn't know
anything about football helped him ghost-write it. So despite the fact
that I have a massive autographed portrait of him in my hall that I
basically bow to every morning, his book was awful. The moral of the
story there being, just because you're a footballing great doesn't mean
to say you can pick up a pen.
To be honest, good football books are few and far between. One that
sticks in my mind is Eamonn Dunphy's Only A Game? (Penguin), which is
his diary of being a professional footballer at Millwall back in 1976.
It's a very honest and well-written book and I'd hold it up as the way
good football books should be.
I'm a great fan of William McIlvanney, especially the Laidlaw books
(Hodder and Stoughton). It's beyond me why they were never made into a
movie. I suspect that whoever wrote the Taggart series was particularly
influenced by them. McIlvanney is a really beautiful writer. I wish I
could write like that.

PRIVATE MYTHS: DREAMS AND DREAMING
Anthony Stevens
Hamish Hamilton, #20
STEVENS'S book is firstly a thorough and clear exploration of dreams
and what humanity has made of them. There is a fascinating
anthropological run-through of various beliefs as to how dreams were
thought to come to us: through Nature, or God or demons. St Augustine
was an astute precursor of later notions that the dream pertained to
parts of the psyche or soul which were ''ours'' but not available to us:
''I cannot grasp all that I am.'' And he worried that God might hold him
responsible to his dreams in the same way as his actions. Was the
unconscious a sin-free zone?
By the late nineteenth century the stock approach of scientists was
that dreams, as many people believe today, are meaningless, simply an
arbitrary jumble of imagery thrown in to the skip of sleep.
In Freud's Interpretation of Dreams (1899) he not only monumentally
rejected this position (Stevens quotes his deliciously wearied comment:
''les savants ne sont pas curieux'') but also ''rendered dream
dictionaries obsolete''. The meaning of a dream and the key to its
unlocking was not on the bookshelves but the head. ''A thing in a dream
means what it recalls to the mind.''
Freud and Jung, closely involved together in work and friendship for
six years, held paramount the conviction that no amount of what we might
call ''counselling'', or behavioural sorting-out, could ever succeed
without this concentration on the unconscious mind. (Even those most
scoffing of any tenet of psychoanalysis today shout ''aha'' when hearing
a slip of the tongue.) When speaking of his own analytic work the author
reiterates this tenet that ''it is not possible to induce radical change
in basic personality, through discussions at the ego level . . . for
symbols are energised thoughts, they provide the necessary drive to
transform psychic structures from a dysfunctional to an adaptive mode of
behaviour''.
The notion of the collective unconscious in the Jungian view, as
shared by Stevens, would make these symbols part of an ancestral
Internet, an evolutionary link-up with what he calls ''our
two-million-year-old self''. And in the same way that we personally are
soul-troubled if the symbols are not used adaptively to heal us, Stevens
presents us with a parallel view of society itself which by losing its
gods is depressed and depressing. Losing a sense of myth and ritual,
there is indeed alienation. As Stevens points out, the popular
reception, especially among the young, of Marcuse and Laing does indeed
reflect how universal is our sense of loss, how ''divided our selves''.
Stevens argues that the path to cohesion lies in the Jungian
psychoanalytic approach whose purpose is to find a way of locating the
patient in the mythic, so that the sad anxious self is cast, like an
actor, in a play with an ancestral company of players and a cosmic
backdrop, thus connecting us with the ''transpersonal narratives of
humanity''.
Without the realisaton of this aspect of our dreams, to treat them in
what Stevens would argue is the Freudian way (making the unconscious a
personal and reductive thing) denies the twentieth century its hope of
recovering from its spiritual malaise. The problem I have about this is
that the above description of the alienated self being properly placed
in a vibrantly mythic context is really a description of what art itself
does, and art is continually breaking itself up and reforming the band.
Art gets us gloriously muddled, and Stevens sometimes seems too eager to
''out'' the artistic ''enemies of soulless rationalism''.
By placing Duchamp and his Dadaist urinal (entitled Fountain),
Modernism and Post-Modernism on the opposite side of the barricades of
the spiritual/beauty/love nexus is to make the dangerous mistake of
blaming the antennae of the times, for the nature of the times. The
''transpersonal narratives of history'' are as apparent in a Beckett
play, some would say more apparent, than in a theory of Archetypes.
When he is exploring latent dreams, the unconscious, and the creative
process, Anthony Stevens is illuminating. Unlike Jung he does not
believe in a ''primordial mind''. He is not suggesting that we carry
some mystical little time-machine box placed in our poor godless
twentieth-century brains, but he does lucidly argue that we are
impoverished heart and soul if we have ears only for the one-dimensional
tune.

Berlin, Friday
THE United Nations climate conference today agreed to set up a
procedure to limit emissions of greenhouse gases next century, but the
United States and the EU immediately disagreed on what it committed them
to.
The deal aimed to build on pledges made by industrial countries in
1992 to cut emissions of the gases, which scientists say are not only
warming the globe but could disrupt the climate and cause environmental
disasters next century.
The final document was approved by the plenary meeting in Berlin
without a vote. It set up a two-year negotiating process to determine
policies and measures and set ''quantified limitation and reduction
objectives within specified timeframes'' for emissions of carbon dioxide
(CO2) and other gases.
But the mandate for these talks -- to be known as the Berlin Mandate
-- did not specify how large the CO2 reductions should be, or when they
should be achieved.
''Let us not be self-congratulatory since we have achieved so little
by this action, or lack of it,'' a delegate from the Marshall Islands
told the plenary meeting on the final day of the 11-day conference.
However, conference president and German environment minister Angela
Merkel said the targets set at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, where rich
nations pledged to cut CO2 output to the baseline of 1990 levels by
2000, could not be exceeded.
The text says that the Rio pledges are not enough to prevent dangerous
man-made climate change and speaks of a ''strengthening of
commitments''.

THE OXFORD BOOK OF SCOTTISH SHORT STORIES
Douglas Dunn, Editor
Oxford University Press, #17.99
DOUGLAS Dunn's editoring of The Faber Book of Twentieth Century
Scottish Poetry (1992) resulted in some odd omissions, including Dunn
himself. One of the unfairly absent poets, Maurice Lindsay, was moved to
write a poem ''On Being Left Out of a Supposedly Definitive Anthology''.
Lindsay protested about this ''sounding slight/that seems to threaten
fragile poethood'' which goes to show how established Scottish poets
feel about the Order of the Boot.
There will be Scottish storytellers out there upset at being booted
out of Dunn's new anthology, but I do not anticipate elegant artistic
outbursts on the matter by missing persons. I anticipate gossip and
that's another story. Scottish poets speak for themselves and take
everything personally. Scottish storytellers speak for all of us as
glorified gossips.
It's often said there's a novel in everyone. I doubt that, but there's
certainly a short story in everyone. Some stories float around forever
in the oral atmosphere. Some are gathered by gifted gossips. George
Mackay Brown, one of the finest Scottish storytellers of the century,
became the speak of Stromness by gathering gossip and putting it about
in print. Brown is represented in Dunn's anthology by ''Andrina'', a
story about storytelling: ''I'll hear the old stories from his own
mouth. Most of all, of course, the love story . . . '' Brown is a great
storyteller. A great gossip.
Brown is also a fine poet who draws on the ballad tradition in many
poems. Almost all who theorise about short stories believe prosaic tales
also renew the ballad tradition. Fred Urquhart -- great storyteller,
great gossip -- introduced Modern Scottish Short Stories (1978) by
citing the ballads as the source of Scottish storytelling.
Following in this tradition Dunn introduces his anthology with the
same old story: ''The ballads are one of the most distinctive
achievements of Scottish culture -- and they are stories.'' But the
ballads are made memorable by poetic rhymes and incremental repetitions
and remind us prosody is not prose: ''The first line that Sir Patrick
red,/A loud laugh laughed he;/The next line that Sir Patrick red,/The
teir blinded his ee.'' Doesn't sound much like Scottish prose.
Scottish prose sounds more like this: ''Norma was 19 now, and she had
been in several jobs already. She had been maid to young Mrs Moyes of
the Barns of Dallow, but she had stayed there only a term. She had told
people that the work was too heavy and that Mrs Moyes expected too much,
but there was a rumour that Mrs Moyes had missed too many pairs of silk
stocking and other articles.'' I quote from ''The Last Sister'', Fred
Urquhart's contribution to Dunn's anthology, to show how Scottish
storytelling glorifies gossip.
Dunn names ''Tam o' Shanter'' as Scotland's favourite tale but that
tells us nothing about the transition from ballad tradition to Scottish
narrative prose. Burns could have cast his fiction in prose and, in
fact, did so in a letter to Francis Grose. Burns knew his verse from his
prose and so does Dunn though, by way of introduction, he writes as a
man battling with the theoretical burden of the ballad-origin of ''the
rise of prose fiction in Scotland''. Best read this anthology as an
affirmation of Dunn's faith in Scottish fiction, not as a tribute to the
ballad tradition.
In making a personal and largely predictable selection, Dunn has done
his homework and is politically -- and artistically -- correct in
including wise modern women writers like Margaret Elphinstone and Janice
Galloway. He is diplomatically correct in expressing the ''considerable
pain'' he experienced at leaving out living writers he admires though
not enough for inclusion.
It is worth noting two conspicuously absent classic writers. Burns
might have made this anthology on the strength of his marvellous tale
''Marriage of Robin Redbreast and the Wren'' but the Bard is barred,
presumably because he is an unfamiliar figure in Scottish fiction.
MacDiarmid might have made it on the strength of his splendid story of
''The Last Great Burns Discovery'' but ditto. Instead of Burns, Dunn
goes the whole Hogg with ''The Cameronian Preacher's Tale''. Instead of
MacDiarmid, Dunn goes for his Gunn with ''The Tax-Gatherer''.
He goes, of course, for Scott and Stevenson and Buchan and Eric
Linklater. And he goes for Glasgow writers who have, in recent years,
become the talk of the town, which proves my point abput gossip.
Alasdair Gray (''Prometheus'') will inform you: ''We move from boredom
to unease and then to panic-horror of an eternity like this. We are in
Hell.'' James Kelman (''Home for a Couple of Days'') will tell you:
''The Green Park was a small hotel on the west side of Sauchiehall
Street. Eddie had moved in late last night and taken a bed and
breakfast.'' Kelman, literary king of the cursing classes, does not make
a song or dance or ballad of life but a meal of good gossip.
The house of Scottish fiction is large enough to accommodate a
literary man like Kelman who folks about impressively with proletarian
language; and a literary woman like Muriel Spark who avoids the Scottish
talk of the steaming yet still gives great gossip. Listen to ''Bang-Bang
You're Dead'', the Spark chosen by Dunn: ''The Colony was a place where
lovers shot husbands, or shot themselves, where husbands shot natives
who spied through bedroom windows.'' When it comes to Scottish writers
of short stories Spark, as Jean Brodie would say, is my favourite.
This enthralling anthology features Dunn's favourites and a fine lot
they are. Despite his introduction, Dunn's selection celebrates the
speak of Scotland. Gossip writ large.

WALKING THROUGH SCOTLAND -- FROM THE BORDER TO CAPE WRATH
Robin Neilands
Little, Brown, #16.99
ROBIN NEILANDS, talking about a journey he made across Spain says:
''My advice to anyone contemplating a walk across Spain is to lie down
in a dark room until the feeling passes.'' Exactly the advice I would
give to anyone contemplating buying a copy of Walking Through Scotland
-- it is arrogant, condescending and insulting.
This book is a ''must'' if you have just arrived on Earth from planet
Mars and are weighing up the pros and cons of going either up the Amazon
or down the Clyde. Neilands' preamble about his decision to walk in
Scotland has them sounding like one and the same thing -- equally
dangerous and daunting.
I was suspicious from the start, a comment on lines from Sir Walter
Scott's The Lay of the Last Minstrel: ''Be there a man with soul so
dead, who never to himself has said, 'This is my own, my native land' .
. . '' Neilands answers this purely rhetorical question by announcing,
pompously: ''Yes, Sir Walter, there are plenty of such men, and I am one
of them.''
Apparently, Neilands is Scottish by birth, although he left ''his
native land'' at the age of three and returned only infrequently.
However, this does not stop him from telling us: ''I was a Scot and had
reason, if I wished, to be proud of it.'' Bully for him, but hardly good
enough reason for 290 pages of childish drivel.
We are told that ''Scotland is a northern land'' and treated to
frequent references to his ''old Highland grannie'', seemingly addicted
to Robert Burns, Harry Lauder songs, porridge, kippers, potato soup,
finny-haddock, oatmeal cakes, tattie-scones, and dishing out punishment
with ''the copper stick''.
The book is padded with historical chunks gleaned from a scan of John
Prebble and others. Haildon Hill becomes ''Homildon Hill''; Robert Burns
''had at least two illegitimate children''; Bill Torrance recites ''The
Ode to the Haggis''; we learn about ''the salutary massacre of Glencoe''
and that ''Toddy is a great Scottish drink''.

A WOMAN who killed her friend after months of being attacked by him
was yesterday put on probation.
Catherine Chappell, 40, was described in court as a caring person who
took up ''life's waifs and strays''.
However, when a chronic alcoholic she befriended began physically to
abuse her, she snapped.
Chappell picked up a kitchen knife and stabbed to death Mr Frederick
Cruikshank, 50, in her home in Caledonian Crescent, Edinburgh, on
December 4.
Yesterday, at the High Court in Edinurgh, Lord Abernethy put her on
probation for two years -- with the condition that she attend
psychological counselling for 12 months.
Chappell, a hospital domestic, originally was charged with murdering
Mr Cruikshank but the Crown accepted her plea to a reduced charge of
culpable homicide.
Lord Abernethy told her the offence would normally warrant a jail
sentence but he added: ''In the present circumstances of this case, I
have come to the conclusion that the public interest does not require me
to impose a custodial sentence.''
Unemployed Mr Cruikshank, of Newton Street, in Edinburgh, was
described as a Jekyll and Hyde character who was a warm and considerate
man -- when he was not drinking.
Chappell struck up a platonic friendship with him that endured for
more than a decade despite his increasing violence towards her.
The court earlier heard that the killer was described as ''a listener,
a quiet, introverted person who is a carer and who had a tendency to
pick up life's waifs and strays''.
In the months leading up to the fatal stabbing, friends had noticed
that she was suffering from a variety of injuries.
Chappell had passed them off with a variety of excuses, claiming they
had been inflicted accidentally.
After her arrest, she revealed to police that there had been a history
of violence from Mr Cruikshank and added: ''He just goes crazy.''
On Decemeber 4 -- the first day that off-licences were open in
Scotland on a Sunday -- she had been drinking in her flat with Mr
Cruikshank.
She had gone to the fridge to get lemonade, in a bid to dilute the
vodka he was drinking, when he attacked her. She later told police: ''He
was hitting me on the face and arms, pushing me, and spitting at me.''
In fear for her life, she picked up a knife and stabbed him a dozen
times -- with six of the wounds penetrating his chest.
About midnight, Chappell went to a neighbour's home and when the door
was opened said: ''I have killed him.''
Mr Cruikshank's body was found lying in her flat.
The Crown earlier told the court it accepted that at the time of the
offence, Chappell had been assaulted and was either still being attacked
or feared an imminent further assault.

THE possibility of a strike by 40 hospital porters faded yesterday
after talks involving the conciliation service Acas.
Industrial action was due to start on Wednesday at Hairmyres Hospital,
near East Kilbride, Lanarkshire, but at a meeting in Glasgow, the
bosses, private company Pall Mall, and Unison, the employees' union,
agreed to meet again on Wednesday, April 19, to continue negotiations on
the porters' terms and conditions.
Meanwhile, it was agreed that a 2.39% pay rise would be backdated to
May 30, 1994.

A DIVING ROCK ON THE HUDSON
Henry Roth
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, #15.99
HENRY Roth's first novel, Call It Sleep, was published in 1934. After
a 60-year hibernation, the first in a series of autobiographical novels,
collectively titled Mercy of a Rude Stream, was published to acclaim
last year. This is the second part of the six-book sequence.
Much longer than Roth's previous novels, it focuses on Ira Stigman
rather than his family, friends, or neighbourhood, beginning where the
first volume finished in 1921. There are many familiar echoes,
especially Ira's raging, unpredictable father, who continually seems to
be praying for his son's extinction, sharing Ira's excoriation with his
wife, to the extent that the boy stands on the eponymous rock
contemplating suicide rather than face his parents' wrath.
Again, the most obvious feature is a text that is remarkably free of
bitterness. After such a prolonged period of writer's block, Roth could
have succumbed to the destructive force of an unexplained phenomenon
that taps into all a writer's negative feelings about himself. Instead,
he now seems to be revelling in his restored abilities, creating a
demanding presence, inventing a novel which continues the experiment of
the first, radiating a similar intensity.
Roth's silence could hardly have been caused by a lack of material.
Instead, it seems to have been imposed by an inability to handle the
material he had, a feeling that it was in charge of him rather than the
other way round. But the richness of the details, the vivid clarity of
recall, begs the same question as before: what is happening elsewhere,
what lives are being lived beyond this work? Everything is submerged in
the way Roth disseminates his material and clarity of the voice. The
world is filtered through Ira.
There is a feeling of events being recalled rather than created. There
are extended elegiac passages, poetic description of people and the
city, as well as places where the rush of narrative is interrupted by
its hero, an old and arthritic Ira Stigman, who suffered writer's block
after one acclaimed novel, addressing his computer, commenting on Ira
and his misfortunes.
He is more than a device which allows Roth to handle his material, but
finally becomes an obvious and simple means of slowing growth and
development, a way of reassuring us that everything turns out fine in
the end, that Ira not only survives, but actually learns to come to
terms with himself, maybe even to like himself, to look back with
sympathy, love and understanding on the boy whose life was effectively
ruined when he not only stole a pen but was stupid enough to insist it
belonged to him, rather than a wealthier pupil.
In this Roth is something of an original, a writer whose self-disgust
and shame was so great it is only an older self who can offer
redemption, break away from the awful tragedy. His comments
simultaneously reaffirm his survival and assert literature as a force of
understanding and forgiveness.

* WARFARE has always reflected, and in many cases determined, the pace
of human technological achievement. The development of weaponry has,
often quite literally, been at the cutting edge of innovation in
metallurgy and craftsmanship, writes IAN BRUCE.
But in addition to their destructive potential, weapons have also held
a social significance. A knight had his sword, the symbol of nobility. A
small sword became the sign of the gentleman in aristocratic circles at
a later stage of history, and the mace remains a powerful token of high
office to this day.
Stephen Bull's splendidly-illustrated guide* charts the progress of
both arms and armour from spear, slingshot and chainmail to matchlock
musket and the Maxim, the first true machine-gun and possibly the weapon
which had the single most profound effect on the tactics and science of
war in 2000 years.
Along the way, he explores how armour began to be modelled according
to the fashions of the time. French, Italian, and Spanish crafstmen
built lucrative reputations on the ornate inlay of protective equipment.
Armour itself became a symbol of wealth. Special suits were built not
only for the bloody business of war, but also for wear at court or in
hunting, the plate-metal plumage of the rich and powerful.
The book also covers the rise of the Samurai in Japan, which was
paralleled by the art of the swordmaker. Many of the katanas, the
ceremonial swords carried by Japanese officers in the Second World War,
were crafted in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, an ultimate
accolade to the skill of their makers and the endurance of their work.
But if European arms and armour dominated the battlefields of the
Middle Ages, Bull reminds us in timely fashion that it was in China that
the first means of mass destruction was created with the invention of
gunpowder.

WHEN the Home Show asked Glasgow designer Linda Reid to come up with
three designs for the same bedroom, the brief was to the point, writes
SUE TRANTER. It was to be aspirational as well as inspirational, which
is designer speak for affordable as well as full of good ideas.
The idea was to follow the progress of an imaginary child and create
three different looks for her bedroom as she grew up.
While the three looks are completely different, they reflect the needs
of today's parents and their design-conscious offspring, according to
Linda. The three rooms will all be shown on the Scottish Television Home
Show later this month.

Kigali, Friday
MORE than 25,000 Rwandans held an emotional reburial service today for
their prime minister and 200 others massacred a year ago at the start of
genocidal killings in which up to a million people perished.
Speakers at the hillside ceremony condemned the genocide under the
theme: ''We need to bury the dead, not the truth.''
The last journey for Agathe Uwilingiyimana and her colleagues, who
fought and lost a battle for reconciliation and an end to one-party rule
in Rwanda, started at a stadium and wound its way in a bumper-to-bumper
convoy to their final resting place at Rebero 10 miles away.
President Pasteur Bizimungu, military chief Paul Kagame and chief
guest, former Tanzanian leader Julius Nyerere, made speeches. Passages
from the Bible and Koran were recited.
Also present was Burundi Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo, whose country
has the same ethnic mix as Rwanda and has been rocked by ethnic violence
in the last few weeks.
Acoloytes sprinkled holy water on the wooden coffins and in graves on
the grounds of an abandoned hotel owned by president Juvenal
Habyarimana, whose assassination on April 6 last year sparked off mass
slaughter of a million people, mostly Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
Uwilingiyimana, a moderate Hutu, was seized by hardline Hutu
presidential guards minutes after Habyarimana was killed in a rocket
attack on his plane.
A dynamic and shrewd politician, she led a campaign in high public
offices for tribal reconciliation and tolerance between her majority
Hutu people and minority Tutsi people.
Five months pregant, she was disembowelled by Habyarimana's fiercely
loyal guards, who saw her as a traitor of the Hutus and the worst
bloodbath in the troubled history of Africa began.
Many of the killings took place hidden from the world since most UN
peackeepers and diplomats were evacuated after the murder of 10 Belgians
soldiers in Uwilingiyimana's guard.
The frenzy only came to an end when guerrillas of Kagame's Tutsi-led
Rwanda Patriotic Front drove hardline Hutu forces into exile.
Yesterday, the first seven of up to 30,000 jailed suspects appeared in
a Kigali court to answer charges they took part in the mass killings.
The chairman of the three presiding judges, Claudien Gatere, adjourned
the case after saying that witnesses who had brought charges against
them were not present.
Those found guilty of genocide by Rwandan courts will face the death
penalty by firing squad.--Reuter.

* Walking Shadows by Robert B Parker (Viking, #15). After last year's
disappointing All Our Yesterdays, Parker returns to form with a treat
for Spenser fans. Boston's slickest PI is hired by a small-town theatre
company to find out who is shadowing the director of a controversial new
play. When one of the cast is gunned down on stage, Spenser is plunged
into a complex maze of motives which make it difficult for him to
separate reality from appearances. A cracker.
* Spencerville by Nelson DeMille (Harper Collins, #9.99). Steamy,
claustrophobic, suspense novel which suffers from being way too long.
Keith Landry, ex-CIA agent who's put out to grass when the Cold War
ends, returns to his MidWest home town to resume his former life. Enter
trouble in the shape of Annie Baxter, his high school sweetheart who's
now married to the local police chief, a brutal and jealous bully. When
the cop discovers that Landry has designs on his wife, the scene is set
for a violent showdown. This town ain't big enough for the two of 'em.
* You Can Die Trying by Gar Anthony Haywood (Serpent's Tail, #7.99).
Along with Walter Mosley, LA-based Haywood is at the cutting edge of
Black American crime writing and this, the latest outing for his hero PI
Aaron Gunner, is about as good as it gets. Few tears are shed when white
ex-cop Jack McGovern is gunned down while working as a security guard.
He was a white racist who was dismissed from the LAPD for shooting a
12-year-old black robbery suspect. But when Gunner is hired to
investigate McGovern's death, he discovers that the old cop might have
been as much of a victim as a kid. Set against the backdrop of the LA
riots, this is a brilliant novel from a fine writer.
* Just When We Are Safest by Reg Gadney (Faber and Faber, #14.99). A
perfectly-timed novel about the rivalry between the police and the
security services over who controls anti-terrorist operations in
present-day Britain. Gadney knows his subject and it shows in this
complex and often terrifying story. When ambitious Police Inspector Mary
Walker, soon to be recruited as an MI5 agent, is murdered, her lover,
Customs and Excise investigator Alan Rosslyn, is seconded to the hunt
for her IRA killer. He soon discovers that the villain is not just the
terrorist but also the corruption within the security agencies. Gadney's
expertise and style will keep you turning the pages of this first-rate
paranoid thriller.
* Mr X by Nick Gaitano (Headline, #16.99). A taut and often brutal
Chicago-based policier which keeps you guessing until the last chapter.
Mondo, a legendary homicide detective, is showing all the signs of
cracking up. It's a war out there and he seems to be suffering from
battle fatigue. So his colleague, Jake Phillips is ordered to keep a
close watch on his behaviour as they investigate the brutal shooting of
a sex-line proprietor and his off-duty cop minder. Meanwhile, a
beautiful new recruit to the sleazy phone call service is being
targetted by an obscene caller who threatens her life. Could Mondo be
the connection?

FREDDIE Starr's homosexual gardener was jailed for 15 months yesterday
for stealing more than #30,000 worth of jewellery from Starr and his
former wife.
Robin Coxhead, 44, had denied stealing any of the jewellery, saying
the comedian gave it to him in return for sexual favours -- a claim Mr
Starr denied strenuously.
Judge John Crocker told Coxhead at Reading Crown Court that he had no
option but to send him to jail: ''I take into account your previous good
character, all that I've heard about you from a number of people who
knew you and indeed trusted you.
''Two of the people who trusted you were Mr and Mrs Freddie Starr.
They made you one of the family. They gave you money when you needed it
and you repaid them by stealing from them.''
During a four-day trial last month, the court heard that Freddie Starr
was addicted to valium and diazepam and would fly into uncontrollable
rages where he would abuse Coxhead, verbally and physically.
Mr Starr, a teetotaller, admitted his drug problem but said he had
received help.
The jewellery, including a Cartier watch worth more than #10,000 and
Mrs Sandra Starr's diamond engagement ring worth about #10,000, was
never found. Coxhead, a former hospital porter, claimed he threw it into
the Thames when he realised Mr Starr had ''set him up''.

GOOD morning, class. Class sit. Today, we are going to look at the way
some of your friends and acquaintances decorate their home interiors so
as to achieve the maximum impact per square metre of floor and wall
space.
''Maximum impact'' means exactly what it says: but unfortunately it is
up to you, the visitor, to supply the impact. We are talking here about
carpets in a light beige pile, with that deliciously indistinct
suffusion of pink that would show up every one of your footsteps even if
you walked across it in bare feet. But of course, when you get out of
the taxi your shoes and socks are most definitely on. Have you tried
hailing a taxi without shoes and socks? It won't stop.
That's the first problem. You walk across the light beige pile of your
friends and acquaintances, handing over the wine and crowing madly about
the inspired simplicity of their decor, and leaving behind you a trail
that would even make the yeti laugh. You will find that there's no such
thing as light beige mud or light beige dust.
But here is a worse scenario. When you arrive at the front door your
friend or acquaintance suggests (nay, demands, in that smiling way they
have) that you should take off your shoes. This is one of the big power
gambits of the good-taste lobby. By taking off your shoes you are making
an obeisance to ''good taste''. If your big toenail has carved a hole in
your socks or laddered your lower tights, you are compromised and
vulnerable. It is part of the plan.
So you pad nervously across the light beige pile, trying to walk
steadily and be as unobtrusive as possible. The earlier arrivals are
already there, baying loudly and deeply into the Chablis (you don't
drink red wine in a beige-carpeted house) and monitoring your progress.
But bereft of your shoes, you lose your balance and steady yourself with
a hand against the wall.
Sorry, I forgot to mention this. The wall is covered in pale ecru
linen, the better to show off the Charles Rennie Mackintosh watercolours
and the Peploe prints that give the host house such Scot-cred. Now the
ecru wall-covering also features your hand-print, deeply etched in
perspiration. The hand-print will remain there, ebbing slowly,
throughout the evening. It will be a conversation piece.
When you leave, you will do so thankfully. You have been a victim of
good taste: and good taste is simply a trap set to catch suckers like
you. Back at home, surrounded by clashing colours and horrendous
patterns, you will relax at last.

Sarajevo, Friday.
BOSNIAN Serb forces have regained ground against Muslim-led government
troops in a successful counter-attack in northeast Bosnia near a
disputed communications tower, government army sources said today.
Serb forces, retaliating against Bosnian army offensives launched last
month, continued to shell civilian targets in Sarajevo, flouting a UN
ban on heavy weapons around the city.
One person was killed and several were wounded when a rocket slammed
into several houses in the government-held suburb of Hrasnica this
morning, a local hospital reported.
But UN peacekeepers in the area could shed no light on the assault
since Bosnian government troops placed them under house arrest
immediately after the explosion.
Serbs risk Nato air strikes by shelling civilian targets just as when
they threaten lightly-armed UN peacekeepers.
Bosnian Serbs laid mines around French armoured vehicles on a vital
aid route into Sarajevo today in a tense stand-off between UN and Serb
forces at a contested checkpoint.
''They (the Bosnian Serbs) put mines on both sides of the
checkpoint,'' said Major Pierre Chavancy, a UN spokesman.
Chavancy said UN authorities were investigating reports that the Serbs
had closed other checkpoints in the area.
Asked if the mines would prevent the French from withdrawing their
armoured personnel carriers, Chavancy said: ''Yes, but we have no
intention of withdrawing. The troops and the vehicles are there as a
fact, not as a negotiating point.''
French UN troops deployed in force at the checkpoint, situated on the
airport road, to put a stop to Serb hijacking of UN vehicles and
harassing of UN-accredited personnel.
UN information indicates Serbs have seized at least 15 vehicles, two
anti-tank weapons, a heavy machine-gun, assorted ammunition, 130 flak
jackets, night vision goggles, binoculars and other equipment at Sierra
Four checkpoint this year.
The road is the main supply route for aid bound for Sarajevo and the
UN mission is insisting on freedom of movement along it.
''We had a number of incidents which could only be described as acts
of banditry against UN personnel and we decided to exercise our right of
freedom of movement,'' said UN spokesman Alexander Ivanko.
UN aid officials suspended all movement of personnel and vehicles
across the airport until tensions were reduced.
Last night, Serb infantry backed by heavy artillery launched a
coordinated assault on two hills near the Stolice relay station east of
Tuzla, and captured both objectives, Bosnian army sources told Reuters
in Tuzla.
The government sources reported Serb helicopters ferrying men and
ammunition into the battle zone in the Majevica hills.
Bosnian army units launched an offensive in the Stolice area on March
20 and siezed at least 50 square kilometres of territory, but not the
communications tower which was their main target.
The Stolice relay station controls telephone and television links in
the north of the country and Bosnian army officers had hoped to capture
it intact.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic had vowed to retaliate and crush
government forces around Stolice and across Bosnia. Yesterday saw the
first significant sign of that effort.

A BITTER row has broken out between planners of the official VJ Day
commemoration in August and thousands of former servicemen who suffered
in Japanese labour camps. The Far East prisoners of war claim that
official recognition of the day that freed them from almost certain
death at the hands of their captors is being trivialised and turned in
to no more than a popular public entertainment. The organisers -- a team
drawn from the RAF -- say the VJ arrangements will be ''re-launched''
when things have ''gelled up''.
So angry are the survivors of the labour camps -- 150,000 POWs and
Burmese civilians died in one year alone during the construction of the
infamous ''Death Railway'' -- that they have threatened to bring London
to a halt with an unofficial march if their wishes for a private
memorial service are not heeded. So far the official plan is for an
open-air service outside Buckingham Palace, a march-past reviewed by the
Queen, a display by the Red Arrows aerobatic team, a Thames-side
fireworks display, and Beating Retreat on Horse Guards' Parade.
In a recent letter to Bill Holtham, chairman of the Japanese Labour
Camp Survivors' Association of Great Britain, the VJ Day organisers
wrote in travel-brochure style about enjoying ''the VJ Day events in
such a unique setting as Buckingham Palace''.
Says Mr Holtham: ''We have had a tremendous battle with this lot and
are simply disgusted. The organisers send out sausage-machine letters
from an address given as Room 1001 at Empress State Building in London
-- but they don't consult. What we want is a day of religious
celebration, a memorial service that is private and ours: one to which
we can invite the Prime Minister or not . . . and I am not saying
whether or not we would.
''We have told them that we will bring London to a halt if need be,
and we can. They know we mean business. We have 14,000 or 15,000 members
and that is not all the labour camp survivors or former Far East
prisoners of war by any means. Now it is being mooted that they will
''make available'' St Paul's Cathedral. VJ Day is going to be our
celebration -- not a Government do but our bloody do.''
The VJ Day Commemoration -- to be held on the week-end of August 19
and 20 although VJ Day falls on the 15th -- is strictly British and
Commonwealth. No other heads of state will be present. Here, as in
America, there is strong opposition to any formal step which would
appear as a token of forgiveness towards the Japanese. President
Clinton, seeking not to embarrass the Japanese, indicated that VJ Day
would be known instead as Victory Pacific Day. America's veterans made
their acute displeasure known and VJ Day it remains.
The celebrations to mark VE Day are in marked contrast. Japan's
ambassador has been invited to attend and heads of state from all over
the world will be at an International Service of Thanksgiving,
Reconciliation, and Hope that is to be held at St Paul's Cathedral. An
official service will be held in St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh the
following day.
Said a spokesman for Room 1001 when asked about a strain in relations
between the organisers of the VJ Day Commemoration and those at the very
core of the event: ''There will be a re-launch of VJ Day towards the end
of June. Broad plans were announced early in January but we will be able
to give more detail when things have gelled-up. To give some idea now of
what will happen would be to give a hostage to fortune.''
THE Thai village of Kanchanaburi is home to a Buddhist temple to
comfort the souls of the dead, and it has a Garden of Peace and a modest
hospital. Also it is a focus of tearful pilgrimage and, at the same
time, a tourist fairground of son et lumiere, stalls and souvenir tat.
Just over 50 years ago it stood at the centre of a sprawling
concentration camp for Allied POWs working on the infamous Thai-Burma
railway that bridged the River Kwai. For thousands of now elderly men,
the village, close to the Burma border, remains a living nightmare of
indescribable horror, torture, and death.
Eric Lomax, now 76, was just 23 years old, a young officer in the
Royal Signals, when he experienced the very worst of Kanchanaburi at the
hands of the local Japanese Military Police Platoon, members of the
Kempei Tai -- Japan's own Gestapo. His body already battered, with both
arms broken, ribs smashed and suffering a fractured hip as the result of
systematic beating with pick helves that had lasted a week, he had water
forced down his throat by hosepipe.
Eric Lomax's torment was unremitting as the Kempei Tai interpreter
demanded, over and over again, to know about a secret map and the names
of other prisoners involved in a clandestine radio service bringing news
of the outside world -- and hope -- to the POWs. Two of the other six
POWs suspected of involvement in the radio news service had already been
beaten to death -- the body of one callously thrown into a sewer.
Despite his injuries, notwithstanding the barbarity of his torture and
the remorseless cruelty of his tormentors, Eric Lomax did not give way.
Known to the men who suffered in Japanese hands and to historians of
the Far East conflict as the ''Kanchanaburi Radio Affair'', the details
of the secret radio operation, the cruelties inflicted, and the
executions that followed in its wake are documented in detail. Sentenced
to death by the Japanese, within just hours of execution, Eric Lomax
owes his life -- as do thousands of others -- to the atomic bombs
exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, bombs that blew apart Japan's
ability to fight on. For Edinburgh-born Eric Lomax and his fellow Far
East POWs, VJ day, August 15, 1945, was not just the end of the war --
it was the very gift of life.
For half a century Eric Lomax, captured by the Japanese on the fall of
Singapore in February 1942, wondered about the identity of the Kempei
Tai interpreter who persisted with his questions, who felt his pulse
between ''drownings'' to ensure he was still alive. As he strove to
re-make his life, his arms crippled as a result of his treatment at
Kanchanaburi, his mind scarred by his torture, Eric Lomax never let go
of the idea that, one day, he would learn the identity of his tormentor.
The years passed. Colonial service on the Gold Coast was followed by
almost a quarter of a century as a lecturer at the University of
Strathclyde before retirement just over a decade ago, and still the
question persisted.
ON the other side of the world, in a language school in the Japanese
city of Kurashiki on southern Honshu Island, an industrial centre on the
Inland Sea, Takashi Nagase was beset by conscience. Just 24 years old
when he worked as a Kempei Tai interpreter at Kanchanaburi he
increasingly suffered feelings of guilt -- not so very much about his
own role but about the barbarous treatment by the Japanese Army of its
prisoners on the so-called ''Death Railway'' and of his countrymen's
continued failure to acknowledge their nation's war guilt.
As the years passed he went back to Kanchanaburi time and time again
-- 35 visits in all so far -- and after the dedication of the Buddhist
temple in the mid-1980s, attended barefoot to show respect, he wrote:
''My feet are rather cold but my soul is getting cleaner and cleaner.''
Close by is a cemetery containing the graves of 3597 POWs who died from
ill-treatment and deprivation, beriberi, dysentery, malaria, or cholera
-- many simply worked to death. Over one section of the Thai-Burma
railway where stone had to be cut through in order to lay the track 10
men died for every yard gained.
Age and increasing ill-health sped Nagase's pen and a book, Crosses
and Tigers, was published in which he revealed how, an interpreter in a
squad responsible for intelligence activity and counter-intelligence, he
daily toured the Kanchanaburi ''concentration camp'' (his phrase)
dressed like a Thai ''and had a talk with the prisoners in order to
learn their thoughts and movements''.
His book disclosed that just after the railway opened -- 256 miles
built through jungle in just 15 months at a cost of up to 300,000 lives
-- the Japanese found out that prisoners had made a shortwave radio in
order to listen to Allied broadcasts, spreading the news among the POWs.
The radio was discovered during a snap inspection of prisoners'
belongings. Wrote Takashi Nagase: ''When all suspects were brought to
the Military Police they had already been beaten up badly. Most suffered
broken bones and were gasping for breath.''
He continued: ''Let me talk about a prisoner for whom I worked as an
interpreter. It was found that he had a rough sketch of the Thai-Burma
Railway with the names of all the stations. He claimed that he was a
railway fanatic and intended to take it home as a souvenir. His
explanation was not convincing because the Thai-Burma Railway was a
secret matter in these days.
''In order to commit him for trial by court-martial we had to prove
the charge of spying, to draw up a protocol of examination, and to
obtain his signature. Military police and army judicial police
interrogated him. The POW stubbornly denied the charge because he knew
that he would be condemned to death if he admitted to being a spy. The
fierce questioning continued from morning till night for over a week,
which exhausted me as well.
''The suspect looked weak and good-natured, but he repeated his
stubborn denials. He must have known that to sign his name on the
protocol would lead to his death. The MP beat him with a stick. I could
not bear the sight so I advised him to confess to avoid further mental
and physical pain. He just smiled at me.''
''Finally, the police applied the usual torture. First they took him
to the bathtub. His broken right arm was placed on his front and his
left arm behind his back, tied with a cord. They laid him on his back
with a towel loosely covering his mouth and nose. They poured water over
his face. The soaking cloth blocked his nose and mouth. He struggled to
breathe and opened his mouth to inhale air. They poured water into his
mouth. He struggled to breathe and opened his mouth to inhale air. They
poured water into his mouth. I saw his stomach swelling up.
''Watching the prisoner in great torture I almost lost my presence of
mind. I was desperate to control my shaking body. I feared that he would
be killed in my presence. I took him by the broken wrist and felt the
pulse. I still remember clearly that I was relieved to feel an
unexpected normal pulse.
''With the prisoner screaming and crying, 'Mother! Mother!', I
muttered to myself 'Mother, do you know what is happening to your son
now?' I still cannot stop shuddering every time I recall that horrible
scene.''
TAKASHI Nagase's book was published, in English, in Australia and his
repentance of past brutalities subsequently written up in the English
language Japan Times. A copy of that article found its way to Eric Lomax
at his home in Berwick-upon-Tweed and the identity of his tormentor, for
some time suspected, was confirmed.
The newspaper article revealed that in 1963, following the lifting of
restrictions on overseas travel by Japanese, the one-time interpreter,
by now owner of his own language school, travelled back to Kanchanaburi
to lay a wreath of flowers in the POW cemetery there. Takashi Nagase
told the Japan Times: ''I felt that I was forgiven at last.''
In Berwick-upon-Tweed Eric Lomax and his wife, Patti, were nonplussed
by this claim. Half a century after his torture by the Japanese Eric
Lomax still suffers -- nightmares, fear of strangers, panic attacks. The
passage of the years has brought no respite. Regularly he travels to
London for support from the Medical Foundation for the Care of the
Victims of Torture, the only centre in Britain with the expertise to
help torture victims overcome psychological problems. The newspaper
article, and a reading of Nagase's book, left no doubt. The young
Japanese officer who put the Kempei Tai's questions during a week of
brutality, who checked his pulse during the water torture to ensure that
he could endure yet more suffering, was now unmasked. What was to be
done?
Patti, Eric Lomax's wife and a former nurse, has for years screened
her husband's contact with the outside world in order to save him upset,
but such is the damage he suffered that even when with her as he opened
a bank account just a few years ago the questioning of the clerk seeking
details brought on a panic attack. Eric Lomax wanted to get in touch
with his tormentor, had questions to ask to clear up mysteries from the
dark days of the Kanchanaburi Radio Affair, but needed to progress
slowly. Patti Lomax sent a letter to Japan.
She told Mr Nagase: ''My husband is the Royal Signals officer who had
been arrested, along with six others, in connection with the operation
of a radio set in the railway workshop camp near Kanchanaburi in August
1943. My husband also had with him a map of the railway. He is the man
you described on page 15 of your book being tortured so very terribly.''
Patti Lomax went on to say that her husband was interested in having
contact ''for he has lived with many unanswered questions all these
years, questions to which perhaps only you can help him to find the
answers''.
In her letter -- the first of a considerable correspondence -- she was
also able to answer Mr Nagase's question to himself as he stood over the
broken body of Eric Lomax at Kanchanaburi: ''Mother, do you know what is
happening to your son now?'' She wrote: ''His mother did die at home in
Edinburgh one month after the fall of Singapore in 1942. A relative has
told me that she died of a broken heart. Perhaps she was with her son,
in spirit, giving him strength during his dreadful ordeal for this was
her much loved only son.''
Picking up on the spiritual relief claimed by Mr Nagase as a result of
his return visit to Kanchanaburi -- his belief that he was then forgiven
his misdeeds -- Patti Lomax demanded: ''How can you feel 'forgiven', Mr
Nagase, if this particular former Far Eastern Prisoner of War has not
yet forgiven you? My husband does understand the cultural pressures you
were under during the war but whether he can totally forgive your own
involvement remains to be seen and it is not for me, who was not there,
to judge.''
Within a week a reply to that letter arrived in Berwick-upon-Tweed.
Patti Lomax's remark about forgiveness, wrote Mr Nagase '' . . . has
beaten me down wholly, reminded me of my dirty old days. I think having
received such a letter from you is my destiny. The dagger of your letter
thrusted me into my heart to the bottom. Please give me some time to
think it over and over again. Anyhow, I am beginning to think that I
should see him again. Looking at the picture he looks (a) healthy and
tender gentleman though I am not able to see the inside of his mind.
Please tell him to live long until I can see him.''
Eric Lomax -- sole surviving witness to the Japanese treatment of
Kanchanburi radio suspects -- met Takashi Nagase at the bridge on the
River Kwai on March 26 two years ago. Later that year Eric and Patti
Lomax visited Mr Nagase in Japan. Eric Lomax is not at this stage
prepared to say how their first meeting went when, 50 years after his
torment at the hands of Takashi Nagase, the two elderly men met in the
shadow of a bridge that cost so many thousands of lives.
Currently completing a book of his experiences at Kanchanaburi which
is due for publication this summer, Eric Lomax repudiates the word
''hate'' in connection with his view of the Japanese today. A fuller
statement of his view on forgiveness for wrongs done must wait.
But according to Mr Nagase this week: ''Eric Lomax and I are now quite
friends -- he told me 'more than friends' -- and that is very thankful
for me. I have accepted his forgiveness. When Eric was here with Patti
he and I talked much about what happened 50 years before. I didn't do
any violence to him. I was the interpreter. I never touched him except
to measure his pulse. I feel some responsibility through my role as
interpreter. I did something wrong as a soldier of the Japanese Army --
the Japanese Army did very brutal things to POWs. I feel the sin.''
On VJ Day Eric Lomax will be in Britain, busy launching his book . . .
Takashi Nagase will be back at Kanchanaburi. ''A reunion is planned and
I am taking a party of Japanese veterans -- all very good people. As
death comes closer and closer I want them to be able to clear their
minds -- to effect a reconciliation. But I worry. I do not want trouble
and some British people feel much hate for the Japanese.''

VICTIMS of the Marchioness riverboat disaster were unlawfully killed,
an inquest jury decided yesterday.
The 51 victims died as the result of a collision with the motor vessel
Bowbelle on the River Thames in central London on August 20, 1989.
Relatives of the dead wept as the jury announced its verdict to west
London coroner Dr John Burton after retiring for more than four hours.
The victims died in the collision on a disco cruise at night through
the heart of London.
The sinking of the pleasure boat in the early hours was unlike other
disasters at that time because no public inquiry was ordered.
The Marchioness Action Group pressed for the decision to be reversed.
An inquest was opened by Westminster coroner Dr Paul Knapman, but
adjourned after four days of evidence.
The adjournment was because of the announcement that Mr Douglas
Henderson, master of the Bowbelle, the dredger in collision with the
Marchioness moments before the sinking, was to be prosecuted for failing
to keep a proper lookout.
When he was acquitted after two trial juries failed to reach verdicts,
Dr Knapman said it was ''not in the public interest'' to continue the
inquest.
The continuing action group campaign ended with a successful High
Court challenge, after which Dr Burton agreed to hold a new inquest,
which has lasted a month.
A Department of Transport spokesman said last night: ''We are studying
the jury's recommendations.''
The jury of six women and four men said its verdict was reached by a
nine-to-one majority.
The coroner had explained during his summing-up that a verdict of
unlawful killing could not apply to anyone cleared by a court.
This would rule out the master of the Bowbelle, Captain Henderson,
because he was acquitted after juries in two trials were unable to agree
verdicts on a charge of failing to keep a proper lookout.
Nor could it apply to the owners of the Bowbelle, South Coast
Shipping, who faced a private prosecution for corporate manslaughter
which was rejected by a magistrate at the committal stage.
He then read out the rest of the jury's findings on the deaths of 43
victims. Families of the other eight had requested that they be excluded
from the new inquest as they were satisfied with the original brief
inquest held in 1990.
He then read a list of 12 recommendations by the jury, including a
call for a new law setting maximum blood alcohol levels for seamen on
duty.
''In the event of an accident, all crews should be breathalysed and
tested for drugs as a matter of urgency,'' they said.
On Thursday a statement by Mr Henderson was read to the inquest, in
which he said he had drunk six pints of beer in five pubs between about
3pm and 6pm on the afternoon before the 1.45am disaster.
Another key recommendation included a call for vessels over 40 metres
on the Thames to post a lookout at the bow ''who is either an officer or
another suitably qualified person''.

Moscow, Friday
RUSSIAN forces today poured artillery fire on the Chechen town of
Samashki, one of the few remaining centres of resistance in the rebel
region.
Reuters correspondent Lawrence Sheets, watching from a Russian
checkpoint about one mile outside Samashki, saw black smoke rising from
the town as it was pounded by shells. Samashki is about 22 miles west of
the capital Grozny.
The town, once home to about 15,000 people, is one of the last small
areas occupied by Chechen fighters apart from mountains south of Grozny.
The last two big rebel bastions, the towns of Shali and Gudermes, fell
to the Russians last week. -- Reuter.

Graeme Houston tells BEVERLEY BROWN how his new home just came to him
out of the blue
AMENITIES such as local shops, transport, and leisure facilities are
usually high on a home-buyer's list of priorities. But when Graeme
Houston ventured into the property market for the first time, nothing
was further from his mind.
Graeme, 29, is a professional hot-air balloon pilot and his company,
Scotair Balloons, is the only Civil Aviation Authority-certified
operator in Scotland. When Graeme started in business four years ago, he
chose the Clyde Valley/Borders as a base for his champagne flights
because it offered the best flying amenities: large fields, convenient
take-off sites, no high mountain ranges and a good network of roads to
ease the task of retrieving balloons and their passengers.
Home was a secondary consideration, and in the early days of the
business Graeme and his partner Lisa were living in a rented cottage in
Biggar which was far from ideal. It was cold and damp, with no central
heating, and windows that let in more than they kept out. Three years
later business was booming -- and they decided to look for a house to
buy. At this point Graeme discovered that house hunting from the air was
a distinct advantage.
''Flying a balloon and taking up to 12 passengers at a time doesn't
leave much time for aerial surveying,'' said Graeme. ''But one property
I flew over several times seemed to be in an ideal location. Fortunately
I had marked it on one of my maps -- which is just as well because if I
hadn't seen it from the air I would never have known it existed.''
The house in question is one of three properties in a courtyard
setting, well back from the road between Broughton and Peebles. The
buildings had originally been a stable complex for Rachan Manor House,
which was demolished just after the Second World War. Still part of
Rachan estate, they have since been converted into three homes in what
can only be described as an idyllic setting. Surrounded by woods and a
large pond, the area is rich in traditional wildlife such as rabbits,
swans, ducks, grouse, and mink -- but there's also a few non-traditional
residents in the form of turkeys and a pot-bellied pig.
Graeme had learned that Stable Cottage had once been on the market, so
he simply drove up, knocked on the door and inquired if it was, or might
be, for sale. By amazing co-incidence, the cottage was about to be put
on the market. Seeing it from the ground for the first time, the cottage
surpassed Graeme and Lisa's expectations, and at #44,000 the price was
right too.
They moved in last year, but with summer approaching Graeme was on
standby to fly passengers early morning and early evening, which meant
they had very little time for decorating and refurbishing. ''Although we
fly in the winter too, the summer months are the busiest and as last
year turned out to be our busiest yet, with more than 900 passengers,
it's just as well we waited until the winter set in to tackle some of
the bigger projects,'' Graeme added.
The large kitchen, which was once two stables, has been totally
refitted with pine units and the 1960s fireplace in the living room has
been replaced with a wood-burning stove set into a deep slate fireplace.
Graeme has also fitted out one former bedroom as the Scotair Balloons
office and he and Lisa have finished decorating the hall and master
bedrooms. The cottage has an additional bedroom in the attic for guests
-- but the setting is so attractive that it's seldom empty for long.
''I think we now have all the amenities we want; huge fields and open
spaces all around which is perfect for flying and a home that is
comfortable and cosy as well,'' said Graeme. The courtyard outside the
cottage easily accommodates at least one balloon trailer and the
Land-Rover -- the others (he has three balloons in total) are kept at a
nearby farm.
Graeme and Lisa are blissfully happy with their new home and, who
knows, perhaps enterprising house sellers will capture a new market with
For Sale signs on their roofs!

<HEADLINE>Cheers as rapist is jailed for life Twelve-year reign of terror ends for brutal attacker who 'poses serious risk to women'</HEADLINE>

A RAPIST who waged terror for 12 years was jailed for life yesterday.
Women in the public gallery, all either victims or alleged victims of
Kevin Lakeman, cheered when Mr Justice Potts passed sentence at
Newcastle upon Tyne Crown Court. Several broke down and wept -- one was
only 13 when she was attacked.
Lakeman, 33, an unemployed father of five, formerly of Sunderland,
initially was charged with 30 serious sex offences.
He was being sentenced after being found guilty at Leeds Crown Court
last month of two rapes and one attempted rape in the space of 24 hours
on New Year's Day, 1982, in the Downhill area of Sunderland.
He had already admitted frogmarching an 18-year-old mother at
knifepoint on New Year's Day, 1994, to a city centre car park in
Sunderland, where he raped her.
A further eight charges of rape and four of attempted rape, all
involving attacks in Sunderland between 1982 and 1994, have been ordered
to lie on file because it would not be in the public interest to proceed
with them.
At his trial, it was explained how Lakeman put fear into the minds of
his victims. He told one that he had escaped from a ''nut house'',
another that he had escaped from a prison in London, and a third that he
would ''slice her up'' if she reported him.
Lakeman, burly and wearing a rugby shirt, showed no emotion yesterday
as the judge told him he posed a serious risk to women and would be put
away for an indefinite period.
He will not be considered for release for at least 12 years, and if he
then remains in jail it will be another six years before further
consideration is given.
The judge stressed: ''That does not mean you will be released from
custody at 12 or 18 years. You will remain in custody so long as it is
necessary for the protection of the public.''
During yesterday's sentencing, the judge reminded Lakeman that he
originally denied the two rapes and the attempted rape, but it seemed
from psychiatric reports that he was now admitting those offences.''
Earlier, David Robson, QC, defending, spoke of the need for Lakeman to
develop a clear understanding of the reasons why he sexually attacked
and humiliated women.
He had expressed the view that he wanted help so that he could
understand why he behaved this way.
However, Mr Robson added, Lakeman still did not agree he was
responsible for the eight rapes and four attempted rapes which had been
left on file.
Outside the court, Detective Superintendent Dave Wilson, of
Northumbria Police, said: ''This is certainly a sentence we have been
working towards for a number of years.''
He said the women in the public gallery were all victims of Lakeman.
''This has been a very emotional day for them. Certainly they all feel
relief that Lakeman has been given a sentence he deserves.''
Lakeman's trial heard that he was trapped by a new technique to test
DNA which came on stream only last August.
A DNA pattern from a sample of Lakeman's blood, which had been
''grown'' by forensic scientists, was compared with semen taken from a
16-year-old girl, one of the victims on New Year's Day, 1982.
Lakeman had denied raping the girl in the grounds of Hilton Castle. He
also denied raping a 20-year-old woman on a playing field and attempting
to rape an 18-year-old.
The jury heard that Lakeman, high on amphetamine sulphate or
''speed'', confessed to a friend in a nightclub that he had raped a
woman.

Young mourner: a young child looks from under a banner remembering the
hundreds of thousands, mostly members of the Tutsi tribe, who died in
last year's massacres during a religious ceremony at a cemetery in
Kigali yesterday. Relatives of the then prime minister and several

DETECTIVES investigating the murder of a security guard said last
night that someone may be shielding the killer.
Mr Harry Murray, 59, of Hilltown Court, Dundee, died in hospital on
Monday. He had been found unconscious in a pool of blood early last
Saturday after being the victim of a savage attack.
A colleague discovered Mr Murray, a divorced father of four adult
children, at the Van Leer Tay Ltd factory in Kingsway West in Dundee.
Last night, Detective Inspector Kinnear Hirst, of Tayside Police,
said: ''Someone must know who did this, someone must have grounds for
suspicion. This was a terrible crime and it's entirely possible that
someone knows who was responsible and may be shielding them through
misguided loyalty.
''I'd like that person to think about Harry, what happened to him,
about the effect this had on those who cared for him, and I'd like that
person to come forward.''
Teams of detectives, backed by specialists in the forensic and
identification departments of Tayside Police, are continuing the
investigation.

<HEADLINE>Nine-day fast wins review of curfew on university students</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978993429</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A HUNGER striker has persuaded university managers to reconsider a
curfew rule for students living in campus halls of residence.
Mature student Scott Barker, 36, from Kilwinning, Ayrshire, called off
a nine-day fast earlier this week after Professor Andrew Miller, the
principal of Stirling University, agreed to the review.
Guests can stay all night if they like in the breeze-block halls of
residence, built in the 1970s on the lines of a Swedish open prison, but
have to sign in at the porter's desk before 1am.
More than 1200 students had signed a petition against the curfew,
which currently forces students with weekend guests to leave functions
at the university's Robbins social centre early. Drinks are served in
the social centre until 1am, leaving no time for patrons to get back to
the halls.
Mr Barker was resting yesterday after his protest, during which he
lost more than half astone. He had told friends he would have gone on
until he was hospitalised if the review had not been agreed.
He said:''I'm a private person and I don't want publicity. I just
wanted to set a clock ticking so the university authorities did
something about the curfew and didn't just use delaying tactics.
''It worked -- there's no way they would let a student fast to death.
I did get cramps, though, and I was fairly weak.''
University spokesman Alan Forrester said Professor Miller had agreed
to meet the students' association over the issue on April 19.
''We want to find out what the majority view is,'' he said. ''If the
majority want the signing-in time extended until 2am . . . then we'll
listen.
''Equally, though, the majority may want peace and quiet. We can't
stop the signing in altogether because it is a safety rule,'' Mr
Forrester.

<TEXT>
BULGARIAN fishermen sitting in on their boat in Shetland say they will
remain on official strike until they get the money they have been
promised.
The crew of the Rotalia refused to talk to the press yesterday, saying
they did not want to jeopardise continuing negotiations with the
shipowner and that they feared reprisals when they returned home if they
were identified.
Their interpreter, Lerwick teacher Derick Herning, said he expected
the men to be paid early next week, under the out-of-court deal reached
on Thursday.
''They will then get on a plane and fly home to Bulgaria,'' he said.
''But I am concerned about what may happen to them then. They have been
vilified in the Bulgarian press and by their prime minister.''
After a three-month strike for arrears of wages, Mr Herning said the
settlement of $90,000 would be divided equally between the men on board.
''This will mean that deckhands get about 80% of what they had asked
for but for officers it could be only 20% to 30%,'' he said.
Mr Herning, who speaks 23 languages and has interpreted for the
strikers since before Christmas, said the men were ''heroes'' in
fighting for trade union rights and free speech. ''What they have been
doing is an important part of the very painful transition to democracy
taking place in that country,'' he said.

Wingate referred to his
fellow officers as
military apes
ORDE WINGATE
Trevor Royle
Weidenfeld and Nicolson, #20
THERE is a breed of British hero only distantly related to John Bull.
It is not by nature phlegmatic, its upper lip is seldom stiff, and its
habitat is far from the playing fields of Eton. Typical characteristics
are egotism, fanaticism, eccentricity (sometimes bordering on insanity),
and an element of mysticism, qualities which seem curiously conducive to
the command of irregular troops. The breed perhaps originated with
Nicholson in the Punjab and Gordon in the Sudan, reached its apogee with
Lawrence in Arabia, and seems to have become extinct with the death of
Wingate in India. Without an empire to hunt in, the strain is unlikely
to be revived.
Like his predecessors, Wingate had plenty of charisma, but his habits
and personality were unappealing. On active service he declined to wash,
preferring to lie naked in his tent, scrubbing himself with a brush
while he munched raw onions. He was rude, arrogant, and also violent:
after kicking a staff officer out of the door of an aircraft trundling
down a runway, he explained that he used to kick his younger brother off
moving buses, and the old impulse had returned. He referred to his
fellow officers as military apes -- he even used the phrase in an
official report -- and was predictably unpopular with them and with his
superiors. After seeing one of Wingate's offensive telegrams,
Mountbatten told him that he now understood his ''amazing success'' in
getting himself disliked by people who had been disposed to help him.
Trevor Royle, who is one of Scotland's most prolific writers and the
author of an excellent book on the last days of British India, makes no
attempt to hide the ''darker side'' of Wingate's character. But he
points out that his subject inspired devotion from subordinates and was
able to charm men of the stature of Winston Churchill and Chaim
Weizmann. Royle takes a similarly balanced view of most of Wingate's
career, allowing his detractors their say, accepting some of their
criticisms but in the end coming down on his protagonist's side.
Wingate's fame rests on the years between 1936 and 1944 which he spent
fighting in Palestine, Ethiopia, and Burma. Royle's accounts of the
latter two campaigns are clear, well-researched and judicious. His
treatment of Palestine, however, is unbalanced with regard to both the
Zionist cause and his subject's involvement with it.
Wingate was a Zionist fundamentalist. As a child he was made to learn
long passages of the Old Testament and as an adult he became a zealot so
fanatical that he alarmed even his Jewish friends. Arriving in Palestine
early on in the Arab rebellion of 1936-9, he formed and led the Special
Night Squads, consisting of British soldiers and Jewish settlers, which
ambushed Palestinian guerrillas in the dark. So brutal and efficient was
he that doubtless he deserves Royle's accolade for his part in laying
the foundations of the Israeli Defence Forces.
Wingate saw the Balfour Declaration simply as a pledge to turn
Palestine into a Jewish homeland and thus disregarded the provision
which specifically safeguarded the rights of the indigenous people.
Royle takes a similar view and repeatedly refers to the Arab rebels as
terrorists without explaining that they might have had a case, that
perhaps it was not unreasonable to resist an overseas empire which
occupied their land and gradually allowed it to be colonised by European
Jews.
Although he is generally quick to reprove Wingate for mistreating
other people, the author is lenient about his attitude to Arabs. He
accuses British officers of anti-semitism but quotes examples of
Wingate's anti-Arab racism without comment. And he does not mention
allegations made in earlier biographies that on one occasion Wingate
executed an Arab rebel and on another took his squads on a revenge
shooting spree near Beisan and killed a number of innocent civilians.
The first charge is less likely to be true than the second -- it was
made by the highly unreliable journalist Leonard Mosley -- but both
merit discussion.
Wingate's zealotry eventually became too much for the British, who
were supposed to be pursuing an even-handed policy, and he was sent to
confront the Italians in Ethiopia. There he achieved his most
unequivocal and uncontroversial successes. As Royle observes, he
''out-fought and then out-thought'' much larger forces and persuaded
them to surrender. Of all the humiliations suffered by Mussolini's
Blackshirts, few could compare with those dealt by Wingate.
The war in Burma provides the climax of Wingate's career but, by
killing him in the middle of it, hinders an assessment of his military
ability. The author grants a fair amount of space to those officers who
considered him to be a showman and who claimed that his Chindit
campaigns were sideshows which achieved little of strategic value. But
eschewing the account-book approach, he argues that the Chindits were
invaluable because they proved that British soldiers could be trained to
fight the Japanese on equal terms in the jungle. Their expeditions
raised morale and later diverted Japanese forces from the offensives at
Imphal and Kohima. Of Wingate's ''military genius'', declares Royle,
''there is no doubt''. And although many people, especially the military
historians, have expressed very serious doubts, I am inclined to agree
with him.

A FOOTBALL manager is planning to bring Secretary of State Ian Lang
into a row with a school over payment of fees.
Hamilton Accies boss Iain Munro hit out at Hamilton College after
being ordered by a sheriff to pay the school more than #1000.
The school sued Mr Munro, 43, and wife Linda, 40, for a term's fees
after the couple took their children Gail, 12, and Jill, 9, from the
school without giving the proper notice.
Last night, the former Hibs and Scotland player said: ''I'm feeling
pretty bitter about this.
''I'm going to take this all the way and if that means bringing the
Scottish Office in, then I'll do it.''
Hamilton College claimed Mr Munro was obliged to give them a term's
notice before taking the girls away, or pay a term's fees.
However, Mr Munro claimed he felt he had to withdraw his children
immediately because of the school's attitude to holidays in term time.
He said that because of his job he was unable to take them away during
school holidays.
In his written verdict, Sheriff David Bickett said that although he
was ''sympathetic'' to the Munros' case, he accepted they had signed a
contract to give one term's notice, or pay a term's fees.
He ordered the couple to pay #1282.50 plus expenses and legal fees.
No-one at Hamilton College was available for comment.

THE seafaring industry, from shipping agents to captains, were warned
yesterday of the dangers of drug abuse at sea.
Grampian Police held a special seminar aboard the MV St Clair in
Aberdeen Harbour to highlight the need for a greater awareness of the
problem.
Superintendent Mike Tucker said that as drug abuse becomes more
prevalent in society as a whole, its possible effect on safety at sea
could not be ignored.
''Drug abuse seems to be touching every sector of society and we are
keen to raise the awareness levels of those who are connected with the
shipping industry,'' he said.
He said ferry passengers or crew could be tempted in the belief there
was no police force on the high seas.
''It's up to the captains, officers, and the crews themselves to
ensure this does not happen. If it does, the vessel's safety could be
put in jeopardy,'' he said.

There is no shortage of Jeremiahs in Britain -- but William Davis is
attempting to counterbalance them all single-handed. William Russell
talks to the man who thinks we should gloom on the nose
WILLIAM Davis is optimistic about the future, yet clings to the past.
Is there a man alive outside the Third World who still uses a manual
typewriter in the age of the word processor? Davis, founder and editor
of High Life, the British Airways magazine, former editor of Punch,
financial editor of the Guardian, and the Sunday Express and the Evening
Standard, author of 12 previous books, magazine publisher and an adviser
to top people -- he wrote many of the economic sections of Margaret
Thatcher's speeches -- does. He likes the noise and the fact that the
copy is not lost by the computer.
''She thought I was one of the few economists who could write in plain
English -- which is true,'' he said of his association with Lady
Thatcher. You don't get where he has, a self-made millionaire, through
false modesty, so why not drop the odd name and assert your virtues in
the process?
Davis has decided to prove that the Jeremiahs -- from Malthus to the
pundits of World in Action and Panorama, Martin Van Crefeld, the Israeli
military analyst, author of On Future War, and Will Hutton, economics
editor of the Guardian, author of the best-seller, The State We Are In
-- are wrong. They are wrong now, always have been, and will be yet
again. To do this he has written his own book, The Lucky Generation,
subtitled ''A Positive View of the 21st Century'', which is nothing if
not optimistic. He also plans to challenge Hutton to debate the issue,
although the challenge has not yet been taken up.
The only people who face an uncertain future in his world acording to
Davis are the Windsors -- the monarchy gets abolished in 2046 -- and
even that future is scarcely bleak. Ex-King William V, married for the
second time in 2050 to a French actress, has lavish appartments in
London and Paris, Buckingham Palace and Windsor having been handed over
to the English Tourist Board.
Davis, seated behind that typewriter, has cast himself as a masculine
version of Little Mary Sunshine and plays the role to the hilt. ''You
get nothing but gloom and doom from the Brits,'' he said. ''They wallow
in self-pity half the time.'' Then he advised me, if I wanted to be
cheered up, to talk to some of the 20 million foreign visitors a year
who come to Britain, and to some of those who visited Glasgow and
Edinburgh. ''They will tell you how marvellous it is,'' he said. ''Then
talk to the people who are putting billions of pounds of investment in
Scotland and contrast that with the moaning by the politicians and the
media. I find it quite bizarre. You have this great act of faith by
foreign investors -- the Japanese seem to have more faith in the future
of Britain than the British -- and yet there is all this gloom. I find
that staggering, but then I am an old Beaverbrook-style optimist.
''I think we work ourselves into a state where, although the economic
signs are good, the feel-good factor is not present. I don't understand
it. Inflation is low, unemployment is down, we have the best economic
performance for 30 years, people are investing a lot of money in
Britain, and yet all we do is whinge. The Australians call us whingeing
Poms and they are right.''
Now whether one believes Davis right or wrong, one has to agree that
almost all the Jeremiahs have proved to be wide of the mark. Remember
the oil crisis, global warming, the end of the world? His optimism also
has the backing of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, who
chose the day we met to pronounce that ''years of boom lie ahead for
Britain''. Clarke based his forecast on the best set of trade figures
Britain has had for a decade -- ''I owe him a cheque for helping me
promote my book,'' said Davis -- although Ken might bear in mind that
Treasury forecasts are about as accurate as Jeremiah's.
As an immigrant -- Davis was born in Germany, came to Britain when he
was 16 and, as he made clear, has ''chosen'' to be British -- he said he
found it odd that the British a hundred years ago had built and ruled
the greatest Empire the world had ever seen through being positive,
optimistic, and self-confident, and yet there had been this turn round
in our attitude. ''You don't get anything by being negative,'' he added.
''When you think how people are going on about how this country is
finished and we are putting up our best export performance -- I don't
understand.''
The medical advances that had taken place alone would have justified
the title of his book, he added. ''Every day brings incredible good
news. I think one has to have an historical perspective and not listen
to the avalanche of bad news from TV. One of the things Jeremiahs do is
to produce these bad reports so that they can get funds for more
research which keeps them in gainful employment. One gets highly
suspicious of their motives for alarming people. If they do that it
funds another study -- and we fund a lot of studies in this country.''
The idea there had been some kind of golden age which the present
generation had missed out on was wrong. Look at Glasgow. Look at the
smoke-stack industries. Nobody missed them. Nobody missed working in a
sweatshop. He remembered the Glasgow of 30 or 40 years ago and was
astonished at the difference. The European City of Culture had made
people look at it in a different way, look at its attractions, it was
just exciting.
There had never been jobs for life. There would not have had to be
trade unions if there had been. There was no cushioning in his father's
day. No welfare state. And what about the Depression of the 1930s? Where
did this idea about jobs for life come from? He had had 10 different
jobs in his career and each one had been a fresh challenge. There was
nothing the Government could do about it. It was a consequence of
change. People had constantly to retrain now and that was what they had
to recognise. Hardship to most young people today was largely a matter
of unfulfilled expectations. They were in a hurry. They blamed the
government, everyone else but themselves. He believed that relentless
cynicism had created a misleading portrait of Britain in the mid-1990s,
and that on almost any objective ground we should feel good about the
future.
In the foreword he deplores the national tendency to indulge in
pessimistic guesswork. Optimistic guesswork, which is what the book
contains, makes a refreshing change. Maybe John Major should get Davis
to write bits of his speeches. And you can't keep an optimist down. When
his regular publisher said he would publish a doomsday book, but not an
optimistic one, Davis simply found another publisher.

And there's quite
an encouraging word
from Sean Connery,
too, as the Balmoral
Collection wins swatches
of approval for its
Glasgow-based creators
THE Glasgow wallcoverings and fabrics firm Crawford &amp; Sons is bursting
with pride -- because it has received an order from an extremely
prestigious address: Buckingham Palace, no less.
But how, and why? ''We were contacted out of the blue by the palace,''
says director Lindsay Crawford. ''We learned that one of their employees
had encountered difficulty in obtaining a tartan to re-do some of the
palace's furniture. This lady had been told that tartans were not
available for upholstery purposes, but by chance she saw fabric swatches
from our new Balmoral Collection. So she phoned us.
''She told us she had immediately appreciated the warmth and
usefulness of the material and wanted to place an order. Naturally, we
were happy to oblige. Our MacNaughton tartan is now on its way to the
Palace.''
The new Balmoral Collection is a unique range of co-ordinated tartans,
fabrics and wallpapers. The range has also been used in the new interior
of the prestigious Marine Highland Hotel in Troon where it won the
admiration of one of Scotland's most famous sons.
Andrew Overton, general manager of the hotel, explains that he
received a compliment from none other than film star Sean Connery: ''I
sat next to Mr Connery during dinner and he commented on the Balmoral
Collection: 'It is very, very good. I like it.' So I told him where it
came from.''
The new collection uses tartans in an innovative way. Lindsay Crawford
explains: ''Designers have often tried to incorporate tartans in
luxuriously finished interiors but until now the use of tartan fabrics
created problems because of the roughness of the fabric, for example in
upholstery. Similarly, soft furnishings do not lend themselves well to a
woollen cloth.
Crawford &amp; Sons created the Balmoral collection to make the use of
tartans easier. ''For the first time, we have woven tartans in a
traditional manner using 100% pure Egyptian cotton,'' says Lindsay's
brother and co-director, Graham. ''This gives a clean, smooth finish and
greater comfort.''
But Balmoral is not just a tartan range. Crawford &amp; Sons has also
included in its new range a large number of specially-commissioned
printed and woven fabrics, wallpapers and border.
* The new collection is available from 600 retail outlets in Britain,
the USA, Ireland and other European countries. In Glasgow, it is
available from Decorum in Sauchiehall Street. For more information, tel:
0141-353 3344.

SIR Norman Foster takes up 54 lines in Who's Who, 1995; John Major's
count is 15, Tony Blair's eight.
Aged 59, and twice-married, he has offices in London, Frankfurt,
Nimes, Berlin, Hong Kong, and Japan.
His emphasis on traditional architectural principals and classical
designs has led him to criticise several buildings for their
''monstrous'' Modernism.
Redditch-born Sir Norman has won numerous design awards. Creations
include headquarters for IBM, Renault, and the Hong Kong and Shanghai
Bank.
The ITN building, London; Century Tower, Tokyo, and Barcelona Telecom
Tower are also his work.
Last year, he was selected as consultant architect for the #110m
British Museum extension, which is seeking 50% of its costs from the
Millenium Fund.
Such a drain on resources could have repercussions in Scotland.
Projects like the National Gallery for Scottish Art will also be looking
for Millenium funding.

RADIOGRAPHERS moved a step closer to joining the health workers' pay
rebellion yesterday by deciding to debate a call for industrial action.
An emergency motion urging the ruling council of the Society of
Radiographers to consider holding a ballot will be discussed at the
union's annual conference on Monday.
If the society votes for industrial action it will be only the third
time in 75 years its members have taken such a step.
Like other health workers, radiographers are fighting plans to
localise pay bargaining within the National Health Service.
The emergency motion to be put before the conference, being held in
Bath, rejects local bargaining in the interests of maintaining national
standards.
Society spokesman Warren Town said: ''Radiographers play a crucial
part in the treatment of cancer patients.
''They are desperate to maintain high standards. If their pay is
determined by local trusts we will end up with a two-tier health
service.''
Local pay offers to radiographers currently range from 1% to 3.5% but
the society pointed out that most offers come with strings attached,
like shorter holidays or restrictions on time off for sickness.
The announcement came as family doctors threatened unprecedented
sanctions in response to Government plans to change out-of-hours care.
The proposed changes, announced by Health Minister Gerry Malone on
Thursday, were dismissed by the British Medical Association as ''little
more than a repetition of the Government's previous meagre proposals''.
GP leaders were ''seriously disappointed'' with the package, put
forward by Mr Malone at a meeting with the BMA's general medical
services committee.
The Government wants doctors to agree to changes in the way they are
paid for out-of-hours duties and is proposing #2000 per annum and #9 per
visit for individual GPs.

HARD-UP Scottish private schools may be helped out by a Government
scheme for US-style sports bursaries for talented pupils from state
schools.
The plans to make use of facilities at some private fee-paying schools
were discussed at a meeting recently between Sports Minister Iain Sproat
and representatives of the Headmasters' Conference, which represents 230
of the UK's top private schools, including 19 in Scotland.
It is known that private schools in Scotland, especially those with
boarders, are suffering financially as the economic climate hits those
parents who would normally send their children to them.
The proposals have been condemned by Ms Elizabeth Maginnis, Lothian
education convener, who claims that local councils are being forced to
sell off playing fields because of Government under-funding.
A spokesman for one of Scotland's most exclusive boarding schools, who
did not want to be named, said yesterday:''Private schools, some of
which charge up to #3000 a term, are struggling and are looking for
alternative means of financing.
''Unfortunately, the price of private education is going up higher
than the rate of inflation and this is reflected in the number of pupils
being placed.
''If, as predicted, the next Government is of a different complexion
to the present one and they go ahead with abolishing assisted places,

<TEXT>
A DRUGS trafficker who supplied Scotland's black market with #5m worth
of the drug Temazepam, was jailed for four and a half years at Guildford
Crown Court yesterday.
Sundeep Amin, 36, flooded Glasgow, Edinburgh, and other cities with
3,800,000 capsules which, as a drugs wholesaler licensed by the Home
Office, he bought legitimately for #94,000.
After Amin, of Welbeck Close, New Malden, Surrey, was convicted at
Kingston Crown Court in February, Judge John Bishop was told Amin was
strongly believed to have considerable hidden assets. Yesterday,
however, details of his personal wealth were still unknown.
Amin was said to have been signatory to a bank account in Jersey,
through which he had tried to pass #40m in Swiss francs.
Nevertheless, a lengthy investigation has failed to find any trace of
large sums and, at yesterday's hearing, Judge Bishop ordered Amin to pay
#10,500 from the sale of his mortgaged house -- his only known asset.
Amin, who had denied conspiracy to supply Temazepam, was told by the
judge: ''It is clear the supply of it to unauthorised people leads to
enormous misery, a growing need and dependency, physical harm, and even
death.
''It is clear you used your special position to supply that drug, and
obtained these enormous quantities to make the maximum profit for
yourself, taking advantage of, and encouraging, the addiction of others
through a deliberate, careful, and calculated course of conduct.
''It is an example of greed on a considerable scale.''
Judge Bishop said the value of the capsules on the black market ranged
from #3.8m to #11.4m ''a grotesque sum''. He had no way of knowing what
Amin's profit was but calculated it at 10% of the lower figure --
#380,000.
He ordered that Amin be jailed for a further year, to run
consecutively with the four-and-a-half-year term, in default of payment
of the #10,500 from the sale of his house.
The case has already led to calls from politicans, particularly in
Scotland, for the Government to tighten up procedures enabling drugs
wholesalers to obtain Home Office licences.
The prescription-only Class C drug is widely abused in Scotland and is
fast becoming a major problem in the rest of the UK. When injected by
addicts, it can lead to blood clots and amputation, and needle-sharing
is said to have contributed to the spread of the AIDS virus.
During the trial, it was said that after Amin bought the Temazepam,
from three legitimate sources, the capsules were taken to Scotland,
where they were sold on the streets for between #1 and #3 each.
Amin produced fake documents to show he sold the drugs to a small
chemist in West Kensington, London. The chemist had never heard of Amin
or his company -- and the quantity involved would have been enough to
last his business for 350 years.

A RANGE of new fabrics from G P &amp; J Baker, one of Britain's leading
manufacturers whose name was first established in 1884, takes
fairy-tales and folklore as its inspiration, writes KENNEDY WILSON.
The Mythique collection of printed cotton furnishing fabrics recreates
the splendour of ancient Turkey with Caliph's Palace, Arravis Tarva, and
Sultan's Orchard, four complementary cotton prints bearing elephants,
horsemen and musicians. Colours are as exotic and dazzling as the
Ottomon Empire was itself: tomato red, jade, mustard and cobalt blue.
Inspired by the tribespeople of Ghana, Ashanti depicts primitive birds
and snakes on a lush blue background. Asslan is a batik design -- a
menagerie of elephants, lions, chickens and fish.
Veneto and Steam Age celebrate the rooftops of Venice and Victorian
railways respectively.
These bold and bright prints are ideal for dramatic curtains and
scatter cushions. The Mythique prints have a hard-wearing Teflon finish,
and retail prices start at #19.50 per metre.
Toiles de Jouy were handsome and hardwearing furnishing cottons first
made in the 18th century. Quintessentially French, these printed or
woven fabrics showed hunting or pastoral scenes in a repeated pattern.
For some years wallpaper and fabrics have been available with toile
motifs.
At first wood blocks were used, then copper engravings (often taken
from works by famous artists of the day) introduced fine quality line
drawings printed on material. Popular colours included madder red,
purple and China blue.
Toiles are still available -- often in matching wallpaper and
curtain/upholstery fabric. But to modern eyes the repeated milkmaids,
shepherds and Arcadian temples that so enchanted Marie Antoinette can
look fussy and a bit grand. Toiles have been likened to chintz without
the colour.
The high pedigree of the toile has not been lost. G P &amp; J Baker has
introduced its Palio Collection of seven woven toiles which offer a
fresh and original interpretation of classical floral and Paisley
patterns along with gingham panels.
The designs come in seven chalky colours typical of toiles and cost
#32 per metre. The effect is smart, but casual. There is also a rich
damask chenille which coordinates with the toile fabrics (#39.95 a
metre).
* G P &amp; J Baker's toiles are available from branches of John Lewis,
Liberty and other good stores. There is a company showroom at 278-280
Brompton Road, London, and details can be obtained by telephoning High
Wycombe (01494 467467).

This week's BBC row has a
little-known precedent,
reports Hamish Richardson
THE success of interdict action against the BBC preventing the
transmission of the Panorama interview with John Major was not the first
occasion that a broadcast by a Prime Minister has been the subject of a
court action in Scotland. The result last time was, however, different.
During the 1964 General Election campaign, Sir Alec Douglas-Home (as
he then was) made two major broadcasts on behalf of the Conservative
party. As the Prime Minister, he was entitled to make the final
television appeal to the electorate two days before polling day, and for
15 minutes on the evening of Tuesday, October 13, he spoke to the
nation. His main opponent, Labour's Harold Wilson, had done likewise the
evening before and Jo Grimond, for the Liberals, had also had exclusive
television coverage, in his case on Saturday, October 10.
Sir Alec was a candidate in the constituency of Kinross and West
Perthshire (a seat in which he was succeeded as MP by Nicholas
Fairbairn). Among the other aspirants on election day was the Communist
candidate, Charles Murray Grieve (probably better known as the Scottish
poet and writer Hugh McDermiad). He complained to two judges of the
Court of Session that the BBC and the Independent Television Authority,
as well as Sir Alec, had breached Section 63 of the Representation of
the People Act 1949. That element of election law compelled all
candidates to include in their expenses returns all costs incurred in
''promoting or procuring the election of a candidate at an election''.
Sir Alec had not included in his expenses the cost of the BBC
broadcasts (estimated at #4600), and Grieve argued that he was,
accordingly, guilty of a corrupt or illegal practice. It was further
suggested that the BBC had likewise been involved in a corrupt practice
by aiding and abetting Sir Alec's election.
The case was heard after polling day, by which time it was known that
the Conservative candidate had retained his seat with a majority of
11,972, an increase of 2646 on the previous year's by-election figures.
It was also known that Labour had won the General Election by a small
margin and that Wilson was the new Prime Minister.
Grieve argued that Sir Alec's position as MP for Kinross and West
Perthshire should be declared void because of the ''corrupt practices'',
and that there should be a further election with him excluded as a
candidate.
In court, he was represented by John Smith, a young, aspiring advocate
who was later to become Labour leader. Sir Alec's junior counsel was
James Mackay, the present Lord Chancellor. After the case was
transferred from Kinross Sheriff Court for the convenience of the
lawyers, the hearing began in Edinburgh on December 23. Little evidence
was led, as most of the facts were agreed, although a representative for
the Communist Party complained in the witness box that the system of
election broadcasts was unfair and ''undemocratic''.
The real issue to be decided by Lords Migdale and Kilbrandon was
whether the Prime Minister, speaking on behalf of his party and seeking
to solicit support for that cause nationally, was gaining an unfair
advantage over other candidates in his own constituency who did not have
a 15-minute television slot. The fact that Grimond's election as MP for
Orkney and Shetland had been unchallenged despite the fact that he, as
leader of his party, had had similar treatment, was not commented on.
The court ruled that the BBC had a duty to disseminate information and
instruction and that they must ''carry it out as in their discretion
excercised in good faith they think right''. In this case, the court
held that there was no evidence of any breach of the Representation of
the People's Act and, accordingly, the judges held that no corrupt
practice had taken place. The fact that one of the candidates was the
leader of a major political party did not prevent the broadcast of an
election message by him.
The court found that Sir Alec in this broadcast was not primarily
seeking his own re-election; the purpose of the programme was to put
forward the views of his party nationally. As such, nothing wrong had
taken place, the new Leader of the Opposition's election was held
therefore to be valid, and Grieve and the Communist party were left with
a large bill in legal expenses.

GOVERNMENT Ministers are examining radical proposals to take the
weight off the welfare system when the ''baby boom'' generation reaches
retirement age in 20 years' time.
Mr Major has instructed the Downing Street policy unit to draw up
plans to encourage people to save for their old age. The Government
wants to head off the massive extra burden that could fall on the state
as people born in the late 1940s and early 1950s end their working
lives.
Mr Major hopes to encourage saving as white-collar workers faced with
job insecurity grow increasingly worried about the cost of retirement.
One plan would apply tax relief to savings placed in accounts which
could be activated only after retirement.
The scheme would allow savers to make deposits of any amount at any
time and would award tax relief to the money invested as well as the
interest earned -- unlike existing Tessa and PEP schemes.
Planning is said to be at an early stage and several other options are
under consideration but Mr Major is believed to want to include a policy
commitment in the Tory manifesto for the General Election.
At the Conservative Central Council in Birmingham last weekend, he
talked of the need to provide the ''security and independence'' of
savings and pledged to do more to encourage the trend.

TWO publicly-funded bodies, Strathclyde University and Scottish
Enterprise, face substantial losses following the purchase by management
of the viable part of an organisation they set up.
The university will be forced to write off #675,000 in its current
financial year -- the value of its investment in the Strathclyde
Institute for Computer Integrated Manufacturing.
Scottish Enterprise said yesterday that it had, as yet, written
nothing off in relation to the loss of its investment but was monitoring
the situation very closely.
As co-owner of the institute, it would seem likely that the Government
agency also faces sizeable write-offs.
A team of eight, led by former institute chief executive Gordon
Colborn, purchased the viable SI Associates consultancy arm a week ago.
Taking into account their assumption of liability for a sizeable
amount of money due to trade creditors, the undisclosed purchase price
is effectively a six-figure sum.
It is understood that what remains of the Strathclyde Institute is now
on the point of being put into liquidation.
The Strathclyde Institute was set up by Strathclyde University and
Scottish Enterprise's predecessor, the Scottish Development Agency, in
1987.
It was meant to provide a ''centre of excellence'' for training and
research and development in the field of computer-integrated
manufacturing, to boost Scottish industry.
However, because of the stage industry was at, the research and
development side encountered problems, whereas the consultancy and
training side of the operation blossomed.
A spokesman for Scottish Enterprise said yesterday that it had been
aware of the situation for some time.
He added: ''Reluctantly, we accept the recommendation of the board of
Strathclyde Institute that the buy-out was the only feasible way
forward.
''The decision was made on the basis that there was no realistic
alternative.''
A spokeswoman for Strathclyde University stressed that the write-off
of its #675,000 investment would have no adverse impact on its income
flow.
Giving the university's view that, in the circumstances, the buy-out
was the best course of action for institute employees, she added: ''We
don't see it as our role to run consultancies.''
No redundancies will arise from the change in ownership. Twelve of the
13 staff employed by the institute will now work for SI Associates, with
the other employee having decided voluntarily to go elsewhere.
A joint statement issued yesterday by the institute and buy-out team
says: ''The acquisition will position SI Associates as one of the
largest specialist manufacturing consultancies based in Scotland.''

A LABOUR MP yesterday called for a complete rethink of the rules
governing the transfer of housing stock, after a group of new-town
residents voted heavily to remain under council control.
The results of a ballot of more than 4000 Glenrothes Development
Corporation tenants showed that, in an 80% poll, 85% voted to transfer
to Kirkcaldy District Council control when the corporation is wound up
later this year.
The tenants were given a straight choice between the district council
and various housing associations, depending on where they lived.
Only 15% of the 3206 residents who replied to the postal ballot,
carried out in March, preferred the housing association option.
Although different regulations govern the sell-off of stock owned by
Scottish Homes (the national housing organisation), the Glenrothes vote
quickly was interpreted as a further blow to the Government's policy of
banning local authorities from tenant ballots. Glenrothes is the first
of five planned new-town housing transfers.
Fife Central MP Mr Henry McLeish said: ''This vindicates everything
that was said throughout our long campaign to have district councils as
an option for the transfer of housing stock.
''The Government and Scottish Homes have been wrong all along and it's
ironic that this announcement comes after they have been so
comprehensively punished in Thursday's elections for ignoring the wishes
of the people.
''In this case, a group of people had to fight to have the district
council available as an option to become their future landlords and the
massive 'Yes' vote indicates that that's what the people want.''
Commenting on the vote, a Scottish Homes spokesman said democracy was
not damaged by the omission of the local authority because housing
associations allowed tenants to take part in decision-making directly.

THREE sisters cheered outside court yesterday as the man convicted of
sexually abusing them 18 years ago was sent to the High Court for
sentence.
Daniel McMahon, 72, a close family friend, was brought to justice
thanks to an Esther Rantzen TV programme about ChildLine and sex abuse.
Two of the sisters who were McMahon's victims almost two decades ago,
watched the programme and went to police afterwards. He was charged and
last month was brought to trial.
The frail, slightly-built widower elected for trial at Glasgow Sheriff
Court and put the girls through the ordeal of having to give evidence
for a second time.
The jury eventually found McMahon guilty of a total of five sex
charges involving the sisters when they were aged six, seven, and 10.
One was assault with intent to rape, and the others were of using lewd
and libidinous practices towards them.
The offences took place mostly in his home, and some in his car.
Sheriff Kenneth Mitchell remanded McMahon, of Mossvale Path, Craigend,
Glasgow, in custody, and called for social inquiry and psychiatric
reports.
Yesterday, when McMahon appeared for sentence, his defence counsel
asked Sheriff Mitchell not to send him to jail.
He said the psychiatric reports revealed that McMahon was unlikely
ever to re-offend because he was getting more and more frail with every
passing year.
Sheriff Mitchell told McMahon, however: ''The crimes of which you have
been found guilty are, in my view, of such gravity that only a custodial
sentence can be visited on you.
''Having regard to the seriousness of the crimes and taking into
account my powers of sentence which are inadequate, I will remit you to
the High Court for the sentence.''
Outside the court, the three sisters hugged each other and cheered.

DEFENCE Secretary Malcolm Rifkind is to push the case for a #200m deal
for Yarrow Shipbuilders when he visits South Africa next week on a
promotional tour for Britain's defence industry.
Yarrow is one of two companies on the short leet to build four
corvettes for the South African navy, with an option on a further four
ships after 2005. The order, if confirmed, would help safeguard up to
3000 jobs on the Clyde over the next two years.
However, a firm commitment to Clydeside employment would also need a
UK Defence Ministry batch order for three Type 23 frigates for the Royal
Navy. Two other UK shipyards, VSEL and Vosper-Thorneycroft, are due to
bid for that contract in June.
The South African navy is understood to favour the Yarrow option and
senior officers are due to make a presentation to government ministers
this weekend. The other yard in contention is Bazan, of Spain, a naval
shipbuilder with state subsidy.
Mr Rifkind, who arrived yesterday in Namibia, is due to fly on to
South Africa tomorrow. He will meet his opposite number, Mr Joe Modise,
on Monday to discuss Yarrow and other defence business.
High on the agenda will be the contentious problem of South Africa's
bid for the UK competition for an attack helicopter programme, worth
upwards of #2000m.
Based on their own combat experience against insurgents during the
1970s and '80s, the South Africans developed the Rooivalk, an agile,
heavily-armed gunship which has now been submitted as a contender for
British Army use.
However, informed sources in the industry say two US helicopters, the
Gulf War-proven Apache and the Cobra Venom, and the Franco-German
European Tiger are the only names in the frame.
Yeovil-based Westland Helicopters is also eager to supply Lynx
helicopters for the corvettes on offer, and British Aerospace wants to
sell Hawk jet trainers to replace the South Africans' 114 outdated
Impala aircraft.
The Defence Ministry was quick to point out yesterday that there was
no link between Mr Rifkind's visit and sales of British equipment to
South Africa and neighbouring states.
However, the Defence Secretary is accompanied by a senior official
from the Defence Export Services' Organisation, the body which markets
British weapons abroad, and a high-powered sales team.

GORDON and Maria Thomson caused something of a stir when they strode
into the lobby of the Gleneagles Hotel in the middle of the Law Society
of Scotland's AGM last month, clad from head to toe in bikers' leathers.
The astonishment was caused not so much by the form of dress but the
fact that, a few hours' earlier, the keynote speech by society president
Mr Kenneth Ross had centred on the delicate topic of abuse of the
legal-aid system.
Defending the general conduct of Scotland's 7500 practising
solicitors, Mr Ross pointed out that the law society had received just
one complaint of abuse from the legal aid board, a complaint which had
been prosecuted before the Scottish Solicitors' Discipline Tribunal.
He didn't mention the name, but there was no doubt about where the
remarks were aimed.
When Mr Thomson arrived in the lobby shortly afterwards, having parked
his magnificent Harley Davidson motor cycle with its four-speaker stereo
system, it prompted the comment from one lawyer: ''He's got more front
than Blackpool.''
It must be assumed that whoever Mr Thomson was dining with that
evening it wasn't Mr John Barton, the clerk to the discipline tribunal,
who was also attending the Gleneagles AGM.
The Gleneagles incident was entirely in keeping with an approach,
typified by the TV ad campaign -- ''Gordon Thomson, solicitor. A great
man to have on your side.''
On his arrival at Parliament Square one morning for the discipline
tribunal hearing, Mr Thomson was seen cradling a ghetto-blaster to his
ear.
While it was not possible to overhear what he was listening to, Tina
Turner's Simply the Best which was played in the office every morning to
get staff gee'd up, is a pretty fair bet.
The firm was established in June 1991, when Gordon and Maria Thomson,
both partners with Ross, Harper, and Murphy, took over RHM's criminal
practice in Edinburgh.
They set up shop near the Artful Dodger pub in Sighthill shopping
centre and expanded into Fife with offices in Methil and Glenrothes,
described in the Scottish Law Directory as ''law cafes''.
They adopted what Thomson called a ''holistic'' approach to the law,
regarding the criminal legal-aid cases who consulted them as friends as
well as clients who might need help with a series of legal problems.
In an interview with The Herald, Mrs Thomson explained: ''We don't
look upon clients just as a meal ticket. We go to visit them at home and
put our expertise at their disposal.''
Their unorthodox approach led to conflict with, and a string of
complaints to, the law society from law firms in Edinburgh, Leven,
Kirkcaldy, Methil, Livingston, and Perth, and from Edinburgh Bar
Association.

THE activities of the Thomsons, who had betrayed their clients and
their profession, could only prejudice the availability of the Legal Aid
scheme, the Law Society in Scotland warned last night.
Mr Kenneth Ross, its president, described the case as ''absolutely
appalling'' and said he was shocked at the actions of the couple.
He said there was no doubt that legal aid and the scheme benefited the
legal profession.
However, those who benefited most of all were those who obtained
representation in the criminal courts and those who received assistance
with legal problems.
''Behaviour like this,'' said Mr Ross, ''can only prejudice the
availability of the scheme and the service it provides to people, and
anything that does that is to be condemned and is a matter of concern.''
Asked if the Thomsons' case had been reported to the police, the
society's president said he did not believe it had because the matter,
in the first instance, had been referred to the discipline tribunal.
He added, however, that there was no reason why it should not be
reported to the police by the society or the tribunal or, for that
matter, the board, if that was what it wanted to do.
It is not a matter on which the society had taken any decision, he
said, but added that in the past, where there had been evidence that
solicitors acted improperly, it had been the society's practice to draw
the matter to the attention of the police or the Crown Office.
''We have acted very swiftly on the public's behalf in this case,'' he
said. Mr Ross added he had no doubt abuse of this sort would be
restricted to ''a very, very tiny fraction of solicitors, if there are
any others at all''.
The society, he said, was not presently considering in its committees
''any cases you could categorise as Thomson-type cases''.
He said the sum involved in the case was a large amount of money for

POLICE are understood to be investigating the possibility that the
body of a young man found on Arran early yesterday is that of missing
student Robin Grafton.
His mother, Ms Julia Harders, who has separated from her husband,
spoke publicly last month of her fears that her 18-year-old son might be
dead.
The student of applied science at Stow College, Glasgow, was last seen
on the morning of Friday, February 10, when he left the family home in
Commore Drive, Knightswood, apparently to go to college.
Police confirmed last night that the body of a young man had been
recovered from the Achir Ridge in the Glen Rosa area of Arran. They said
there did not appear to be any suspicious circumstances.
The body has not yet been formally identified. However, it is
understood police are investigating the possibility it may be Mr
Grafton.
They have discovered that hehad been taking the odd day off since
Christmas. At least two of his few friends were Chinese and police
appealed to Glasgow's Chinese community for information.

<HEADLINE>Coastguard quits because safety is 'coming second'</HEADLINE>

A COASTGUARD said yesterday he had resigned from the service because
the Government was ''putting saving money before saving lives''.
Mr Jim Evans, a former Fleet Air Arm man with 20 years' experience of
search and rescue operations, spoke out in Lerwick, on the eve of his
departure from Shetland.
''I resigned because of the cuts imposed by the Government on search
and rescue,'' he said, ''. . . lives are being put at risk. Therefore, I
can no longer give agency my total commitment.''
Mr Evans said there appeared to be ''a calculated reduction'' in
staffing and budgets ''to facilitate future technical improvements'',
such as new satellite communications.
''The new oilfields to the west of Shetland will prove to be a major
search and rescue headache,'' he said, ''as the safety of search and
rescue crews will be at risk, due to the severity of the weather,
helicopter rescue missions may well be impossible.
''Not enough has been done to guarantee the safety of the oil workers.
This is a dereliction of public duty, in the light of Piper Alpha and
the Cullen Report.''
Mr Evans's comments reflect discontent among serving coastguards, who
feel they cannot speak in public about their concerns without
jeopardising their employment.
The Coastguards' union warned in February that lives could be in
danger unless more staff were hired to keep radio watches on the
maritime distress frequency, 2182 mHz.
Mr Dutchy Holland, chairman of the Coastguard section of the National
Union of Civil and Public Service, said coastguard stations were being
asked to take on the extra duties without enough officers to do the job.
Mr Bob Driver, regional controller for coastguards in North-east
Scotland, could not be contacted yesterday. His assistant said he could
not comment on Mr Evans' remarks.

FOUR men were forced to bail out of a military helicopter yesterday .
. . just before it crashed on a test flight.
The crash was the second involving the Anglo-Italian EH101 and it
happened a month after Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind took a
controversial decision to buy 22 battlefield versions of the helicopter.
Four years ago, 44 naval versions were bought for the Royal Navy to be
used for anti-submarine warfare in a #1500m deal with Westland.
The helicopter company said the machine which crashed today was a Navy
variant pre-production model which had completed all but 250 hours of
its 3750-hour test programme.
Experts doubt that a design fault was to blame so late in the trials
and crash investigators will be looking to see if there was a
''catastrophic failure'' of a vital component.
The incident happened while the helicopter was undergoing high-level
performance tests at 12,000 feet -- 3000 feet short of its ceiling --
after leaving the Westland base at Yeovil in Somerset.
Later, the aircraft's chief test pilot, Captain John Dickens, was
praised by emergency services and by Westland for bailing out late so
the helicopter avoided hitting houses. He suffered severe back injuries.
Second pilot Don Maclaine and flight test engineers Alastair Wood and
Geoff Douthwaite escaped with cuts and abrasions.
They will be questioned as part of a Civil Aviation Authority and
Ministry of Defence inquiry.
Two years ago, the crew of an Italian model of the aircraft were
killed when it crashed in Italy.
Mr Rifkind overruled his accounting officer -- Chief of Defence
Procurement Malcolm McIntosh -- last month to buy a mixed fleet of 22
EH101s and 12 American Chinooks.
The decision, made to safeguard the future of the British helicopter
industry, cost the taxpayer #300m more than an all-Chinook fleet.

THE Prime Minister yesterday issued his strongest appeal so far for
unity in the party, after the Tories' disastrous performance in the
Scottish local elections.
He was backed by two of his most senior Ministers -- Foreign Secretary
Douglas Hurd and Home Secretary Michael Howard -- in making clear in no
uncertain terms that the party must hold together or face the worst.
Mr Hurd said Mr Major was more popular than the party and that the
do's and dont's for the future were plain enough.
Mr Major, on a visit to Somerset, said: ''I think people will begin to
realise that they expect in the country the Conservatives to be united.
If that shows itself not always to be so, people get bad results.
''People in this country expect the Conservatives to be united. That
is what they have generally grown up with in the Conservative Party and
when it does not happen I think people are naturally concerned about it.
I think they have sent a fairly clear message on this occasion.''
Looking forward to the local elections in England and Wales next
month, Mr Major fought hard to defend the record of Tory authorities.
He said: ''I hope people will contest them on the record of the local
authority. There is a very substantial price to be paid in not voting
Conservative -- very substantially higher council taxes if they vote
Labour or Liberal Democrat. We will fight these elections very hard.''
Mr Hurd, in Harrogate, Yorkshire, said it had been ''another bleak
Friday morning'' but added that the party had had them before and gone
on to win the next election.
He urged the electorate to hang on to the economic recovery and said
there should be no more arguing within the party on Europe.
He said: ''What might pass for hush has settled on this scene within
the Conservative Party, and about time too.
The huge majority of the party wants a successful Britain and a
successful Europe of nation states. That is the way the debate is
going.''
Mr Hurd also launched into a strong attack on the speculation about Mr
Major's future as leader.
He said: ''John Major is an admirable Prime Minister. He is more
popular than the party. Against these two facts the case for change
collapses.''
Mr Howard said the results were ''obviously very disappointing'' but
the one consolation was that they were reversible.

A NEW political landscape, in which Conservatives have been relegated
to fourth position in Scottish local government, brought celebration and
recrimination yesterday.
Labour basked in the glow of a triumph which saw them take more than
43% of the poll and control of 20 of Scotland's new single-tier
authorities, prompting a flying visit by leader Tony Blair to
congratulate his Scottish troops.
The contrast could not have been greater, with a gloomy news
conference by the Conservatives, in which Scottish Secretary Ian Lang
conceded that unless the Tories put an end to internal squabbling they
were doomed at future polls.
The admission by a Cabinet Minister that the Conservatives were facing
defeat was a stunning admission on the cost of internal dissent and the
degree to which the Scottish electorate has turned away from them.
Mr Lang insisted, however, that the Tory troubles involved
presentation rather than policy, promising to hold firm against any talk
of constitutional change. This was ridiculed by the Nationalists, who
cited their triumph in Perth as evidence that they would sweep the
forthcoming parliamentary by-election there.
The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, were quietly pleased by a
performance which had seen their number of councillors jump to a figure
50% greater than that of the Conservatives, on a slightly smaller share
of the poll.
The final figures, which bore out recent System Three polls for The
Herald, put Labour at 43.7% with 614 seats, SNP at 26.3% with 182 seats,
the Conservatives at 11.3% with 82 seats, and the Scottish Liberal
Democrats on 9.8%, a share which brought them 123 seats.
Scottish Militant Labour held just one seat, that of leader Tommy
Sheridan, while the Democratic Left, formerly the Communists, took two
Fife seats. The latter were included in statistics which showed the
dwindling band of independents on 7.4%, with 145 seats, and others on
1.1% with 12 seats.
The SNP hailed the result as their best yet in local government and
called it the first stage of a triple whammy which would see them take
the parliamentary seat in Perth and Kinross.
The Scottish Liberal Democrats described the elections as evidence
that the Tory vote had collapsed north of the Border, leaving them to
capitalise on a Government which had run out of steam.
However, the widest smiles were on Labour faces. Mr Blair breezed into
town to praise his Scottish troops for a job well done, then warned the
Tories to watch out for the English and Welsh double whammy.
His smile was wider than Mr Happy's as he strode beneath the giant
yellow logo and entered Glasgow City Chambers to congratulate Labour
candidates and party workers for Thursday's election triumph.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson admitted he had a problem
keeping his own smile under control.
The Labour leader took a lunchtime flight to Scotland during which he
digested a final result showing his party with 614 seats in the new
Scottish unitary authorities against the Conservatives' 82.
''This result is important not just for us in Scotland but for the
whole of Britain,'' said Mr Blair. ''It's also a disaster for the
Conservatives who thoroughly deserved defeat.
''We must now take that message to the next election test in England
and Wales and repeat our level of success.''
He added: ''Middle Scotland is not that different from what people
call Middle England.''
Labour was making the most of a victory which earned it
congratulations even from Mr Major. The Prime Minister conceded that
Labour had recorded a ''very good result'' in Scotland but predicted the
party could suffer from over-confidence.
Mr Blair responded: ''It's extremely arrogant of the Conservatives to
say that its problem is simply one of a change of image or presentation,
especially after a week in which they have been in deep trouble on
issues like health, crime, and transport.''
Returning to claims that the reorganisation of local government in
Scotland had been an exercise in ''gerrymandering'', Mr Blair said: ''So
the Tories appear to be as incompetent at gerrymandering as anything
else.
''We must show the people of this country not just why the Tories are
discredited and why they deserve to be beaten but that this new Labour
Party is reaching out to people and building a bond of trust which will
sustain us from now until the next General Election.''
Barely able to contain his glee, Mr Robertson said the results were
far more than an anti-Government vote. They demonstrated positive
support for Labour, which had taken seats from all parties.
''This is not just a local election verdict. It is a national judgment
by the people,'' he said.
''It cannot and should not be dismissed by the Tories as simply
mid-term blues. This is a deep crisis for the Conservative Party.''
He savoured the Scottish victory as ''the first step in the three
steps to victory''. The next would be May's English and Welsh local
elections, and then the General Election.
''When you get almost half the votes of the people of Scotland in a
four-party contest, it is not just a mid-term crisis for a discredited
Government but a positive vote for Labour in local councils where people
trust us -- and in national Government where they want us to take
over.''
Mr Robertson insisted: ''John Major has been shown his marching orders
by the Scottish people.''
He poured scorn on the performance of the Nationalists, pointing to a
3% decline in their vote since last year's Euro and regional elections
and the absence of a single Nationalist councillor in Edinburgh.
Despite the SNP capture of Perth and Kinross, Labour stood ready for a
''serious challenge'' in the looming by-election -- the Nationalists had
under-performed in those seats covered by the parliamentary
constituency, said Mr Robertson.

TWO high-profile Edinburgh lawyers are to be struck off for a
catalogue of professional misconduct, described by the Scottish
Solicitors Discipline Tribunal as the worst case it had had to consider
for many years.
Gordon and Maria Thomson have presented themselves as champions of the
underdog but yesterday the tribunal condemned them for sacrificing the
interests of their clients in the pursuit of fees.
They were also found guilty of allowing fraudulent claims to be made
to the Scottish Legal Aid Board and the firm has had to repay #30,000 to
the board, covering 1200 cases in which they couldn't justify their
fees.
After the decision, which was announced in Edinburgh yesterday, Mr
Thomson, 36, read from a statement: ''We are appealing this decision.
There has been no dishonesty on the part of myself or my wife and that
was accepted.''
The striking off will not take effect for several weeks until the
Thomsons, who practise from the Sighthill Shopping Centre in Edinburgh,
have received the tribunal's full findings in writing.
In a summary of the findings, issued yesterday, the tribunal stated
that, during 1992 and 1993, the Thomsons made claims to the Scottish
Legal Aid Board for fees of #30,000 covering about 1200 cases.
''When called upon by the (legal aid) board to justify the claims,
they were unable to produce any files or other records to justify the
fees claimed.''
Also, in six applications for legal advice and assistance, dates had
been fraudulently altered within the offices of Gordon Thomson and
Company and the tribunal stated that the Thomsons had permitted
fraudulent claims to be made.
It also described the behaviour of both Thomsons as reprehensible.
''The motivating force of Gordon and Maria Thomson was patently the
maximisation of fees which could be generated from the legal aid fund
utilising these clients rather than providing them with proper services.
''They set an unreasonably high daily fees target for staff and
vilified them if they failed to meet the target.''
In some cases, legal advice was provided to clients by paralegals not
qualified to give such advice.
The tribunal took the view that Mrs Thomson must accept equal
responsibility for the malpractices of the firm.
The tribunal added that it had no hesitation in saying that Mr and Mrs
Thomson were unfit to be members of the profession.
It also imposed a fine of #5000 on Mr Andrew Gilbertson, who was a
partner for 18 months in 1992 and 1993. The tribunal stated that he must
bear responsibility for some of the firm's failings.

<HEADLINE>Architects pledge dramatic change. SECC to reflect spirit of city</HEADLINE>

THE design team for the #30m extension at the Scottish Exhibition and
Conference Centre yesterday pledged it will be ''visually'' dramatic and
rival the best in the world.
Leading British architects Sir Norman Foster and Partners also
promised the new building would reflect the spirit of Glasgow as ''a
very go-ahead place with a great atmosphere''.
The London-based firm acknowledged that the original SECC, designed by
others, has been the subject of controversy over its architectural
merits since it opened in 1985 at a cost of #36m.
Critics have likened the building to an aircraft hangar and it is now
commonly known and maligned as the Big Red Shed.
Mr Ken Shuttleworth, the Foster partner heading the newly-appointed
design team, insisted yesterday: ''We are looking to do something which
is dramatic -- and not just tin sheds.''
He was also adamant his firm ''still loves Glasgow'' despite ongoing
uncertainty surrounding its plans for a National Gallery of Scottish Art
in the city.
Sir Norman Foster was front-runner to design the gallery after being
proposed by Glasgow Development Agency, but since then the project has
again been put out to competition.
The firm will now set up an office within the conservatory at the
Pumphouse adjacent to the SECC, on April 18, where a team of six expects
to complete drawings for the extension within two months.
Sir Norman -- whose designs for King's Cross in London were described
as ''brilliant'' by the Prince of Wales -- will personally be involved
in the project.
Mr Shuttleworth said the SECC brief was still being worked out and
that it was impossible to speculate on the looks or the materials to be
used.
He said: ''Concepts and ideas will be developed over the next few
weeks. It is our intention the extension will be the spirit of Glasgow
-- a very go-ahead place which has a great atmosphere.''
Mr Shuttleworth predicted the end product would compete on a global
scale with other conference centres.
He said the new 3200-seat auditorium would be one of the largest in
the world. It would be unique in the UK and the new SECC would compare
with the likes of centres in Berlin, Lille, and even sprawling American
conference complexes. Studies are already under way on how best to link
the extension into the existing building and the nearby Moat House
hotel.
The design team intends that the extension will reinforce, visually,
Glasgow's ambition to become a top venue for international conferences
and exhibitions.
Acoustics will be ''a major issue'' according to the architects, who
are well aware that sound in the current building has been criticised by
musicians as well as audiences and promoters.
Foster's is confident of success in acoustics because of innovative
work in the field while designing the new German Parliament in Berlin,
the Reichstag.
Mr Shuttleworth said of the original SECC: ''It was not a very strong
vision in terms of architecture.'' He stressed it had been built quickly
and had not been designed for concerts but exhibitions and conferences.
Its merits included ''a very good lay-out'', with halls to the side of a
central mall.
It was hoped to do ''something different'' with the extension, which
should open in time for an international Rotary conference in 1997. The
event is expected to attract 10,000 delegates and 15,000 others, plus
generate #20m of income for Glasgow, which will be UK City of
Architecture and Design in 1999.
Other appointments to the SECC project, whose backers include Glasgow
City Council, are Ove Arup and Partners as engineers and city-based
Gardiner Theobold as quantity surveyors. Glasgow firm Turner and
Townsend will manage the project.

BRITISH-born killer Nicholas Ingram was executed early this morning.
It was reported that he was asked if he had anything to say. ''No,''
he replied. ''Let's get on with it.''
The US Supreme Court denied two separate requests for his stay of
execution.
Earlier a US federal judge granted him a further 72-hour stay of
execution, then a few hours later the Court of Appeals in Atlanta,
Georgia rejected it, followed by the Supreme Court.
Ingram had been on death row since 1983. He was killed with electric
shocks at the Jackson prison, officials confirmed.
Ms Vicki Gavalas, of the Georgia Department of Corrections, read out
the official statement: ''The order of the court has been carried out.
Nicholas Lee Ingram was pronounced dead at 9.15pm Friday.''
Ingram, 31, had a previous stay of execution granted on Thursday night
only an hour before he was due to go to the electric chair.
Two chaplains as well as Department of Corrections officers were with
him.
Shortly after 8pm (local time) the six media witnesses to the
execution were driven by bus from the gatepost into the prison.
They were due to watch Ingram die through a window in the wall of the
chamber containing the electric chair. The witnesses included Mr
Stafford-Smith and a female friend, Tammy Rae.
An hour before the time scheduled for his client's execution, Ingram's
lawyer Clive Stafford-Smith arrived at the prison.
He confirmed that he had petitioned the US Supreme Court on Ingram's
behalf, but the result was not known at that time.
When a reporter pointed out to him that he appeared visibly shaken, Mr
Stafford-Smith said: ''You bet I'm visually upset, what we are about to
do is utterly, utterly barbaric.''
Asked about Ingram's state of mind, he said: ''He knew this was
coming.''
He complained that the Court of Appeals in Atlanta did not appear to
have spent enough time to ''physically read what we sent them''.
Just a few moments before, Ms Gavalas, the Corrections Department's
director of public information, briefed the press on Ingram's mood.
She said officers with him had described him as ''quiet and
stone-faced''.
Ingram has been drinking a cup of coffee but has declined to watch
television, listen to the radio, or read.
He had been speaking to his lawyers but otherwise Ms Gavalas said he
was ''just sitting there waiting''.
He had again had his head shaved and again declined either a last meal
or to make a final statement, although he would be given another
opportunity to say something as he sat in the electric chair.
Ms Gavalas said that to the best of her knowledge he had said nothing
about his victim, J.C. Sawyer.
Ingram, who has British and US citizenship, was convicted of murdering
Mr J. C. Sawyer. Then 19, he forced his way into the Sawyer home, tied
the man and his wife Mary Eunice to a tree and shot them both in the
head.
Mrs Sawyer was only grazed and pretended to be dead until Ingram left
with $60 cash and the couple's pickup truck.
Mrs Sawyer said on television that Ingram showed no mercy when he
killed her husband. ''We begged for mercy and were given none,'' she
said. ''He was the judge, jury and executioner, all in a matter of
minutes. He certainly didn't intend for me to live.''
Ingram's attorneys argued that he was secretly given an anti-psychotic
drug during his trial that deprived him of his emotions and made him
appear to be remorseless.
