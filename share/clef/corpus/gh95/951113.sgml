<HEADLINE>Problems mount for Tory MP in shares-for-influence row</HEADLINE>

Tory MP Patrick Nicholls last night looked set to become the first
target for investigation by the new independent parliamentary watchdog
as another ''sleaze'' row exploded at Westminster.
The former Minister was being referred by Labour to the parliamentary
commissioner for standards over an alleged ''shares for influence''
business deal.
Mr Nicholls, 46, insisted he broke no rules in offering to use his
position to open doors in Whitehall for a West Country water equipment
firm.
Labour accused him of exploiting a grey area under old rules -- swept
away in the wake of the Nolan Inquiry into MPs' behaviour -- and said he
would fall foul of new guidelines agreed last week.
The dispute centred on a business arrangement with World Water
Services Ltd in which Mr Nicholls agreed to use his influence to promote
the company -- and attempt to win it a lucrative Government contract --
in return for an eventual 5% shareholding.
The link was recorded correctly in the Commons Register of Members'
Interests and Mr Nicholls was adamant that he followed both ''the spirit
and the letter'' of parliamentary rules.
But the Government, already under fire for its attempt to block moves
to force MPs to reveal outside earnings connected to parliamentary work,
effectively washed its hands of the Teignbridge MP.
Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine told BBC TV's Breakfast with
Frost programme: ''I have no detailed knowledge of this issue except
what I have read in the papers, but there is now a parliamentary
commissioner who can examine these matters.''
During the debate on the Nolan proposals, Mr Nicholls attacked the
appointment of the new commissioner as ''bizarre'', and accused
colleagues of over-reacting.
''We got into this position . . . because two stupid, silly, greedy
members did something that most of us would never do,'' he said.
He was yesterday unrepentant about the comments:
''I received no money. I had an unpaid interest and that is what I
registered. . . That is in accordance with the rules of the House, both
the spirit and the letter.''

SOMETIMES, just sometimes, the Brussels bureaucrats get it dead right.
Take driving licences. Beside me as I type is my British driving
licence. A pathetic document it is to behold. It came from the wallet in
two pieces, long since separated, and now threatens to fall apart
terminally in a shower of confetti.
It was issued in 1977, it says here, after the previous one
disintegrated, and is valid, in theory at least, until September 2011,
by which time it will have biodegraded totally.
Last year in Scotland I was stopped for speeding. Two policemen asked
for my licence. They fell about when they saw it and let me off, so I
suppose it is not entirely useless. This embarrassing piece of
decomposing pink fluff, when put together on a table, measures more than
one foot by eight inches. It tells me -- a motorist for 35 years on
several continents -- that I may drive a ''motor car''. Well, thanks.
Helpfully it explains what a motor car is. And a moped, and goods
vehicles, and a ''large passenger vehicle'' which I take to mean a bus.
It lets me know I can drive an invalid carriage at the age of 16, or a
tractor.
At 17 I could, if the urge came upon me, have driven a motor tricycle
other than a goods vehicle, or a small road roller which, naturally,
must conform to the description in Regulation 4 of the Motor Vehicles
(Driving Licences) Regulations, 1981, a copy of which I seem to have
mislaid.
There's lots more. At 18 I was practically fit for driving Concord,
especially if I decided to join the Navy or Royal Air Force.
Whoever designed this preposterous document -- a committee, obviously
-- could have found space left for the updated Rules of Golf and the
Gettysburg Address. The bearer must fold it several times and stuff it
into a wallet, thus guaranteeing its certain destruction.
TO round off this exercise in perverse bureaucracy the Department of
Transport has stamped the letters GB on the front and printed the words
''driving licence'' in nine languages above the line ''European
Communities Model''.
In fact ''model'' is the operative word because if you live in Belgium
this document is worthless. We are supposed to have real Belgian
licences here, not models, despite the Brussels fad for harmonisation.
But now EU transport commissioner Neil Kinnock has come to our aid.
From next year -- if all goes to plan, which it probably won't, this
being Europe -- Brussels should bring us a harmonised, unified,
homogenised, handily-sized Euro-driving licence. A smasher it looks,
too.
It will be plastic, the size of a credit card, containing a heavily
sub-edited account of which vehicles the holder may drive, name, date
and place of birth, address, date of issue and expiry. The Scots can
have theirs in English and Gaelic if they wish. Ours will have UK
encircled by the EU golden stars above a photograph of the holder.
To some, this raises the question of whether it will be an identity
card by another name. It was, after all, Britain which wanted a
photograph included, and none of the other countries objected.
''There is no infringement, potential or otherwise, of civil
liberties,'' insists the European Commission, whose word on this I would
happily accept before our Government's. To me it seems no more an
invasion of privacy than a bus pass.
This card could be the future for all of us if, as many expect, it is
the forerunner of a European smart card. This would mean it being
designed eventually to incorporate a microchip for storing all manner of
information.
It could be used as a credit card, passport, identity card, travel
ticket, security swipe card, or whatever, but we are far from that stage
now. New laws would be required before any of that came to pass. (Is the
Scots electronics industry alert to the goldmine this means for
someone?)
The new design goes before the European Parliament this week. Formal
approval is expected and then it goes for ratification by the Council of
Ministers.
If that also goes smoothly the EU's member states should be able to
replace their old paper licences from next July. But they don't have to.
If the British insist, they could continue to lumber us with grubby pink
paper in the cause of resisting the Eurocrats.
For once Brussels has come up with an entirely praiseworthy idea.
What's the betting some boring Europhobe will try to spoil it?

NOEL COWARD -- A BIOGRAPHY. Philip Hoare.
Sinclair-Stevenson, #25.00
JOHN OSBORNE said of Noel Coward that he was ''his own invention, his
own contribution to the twentieth century'', adding that to be one's
enduring invention seemed to him both ''heroic and essential''. Coward
was homosexual, which everyone knows today, but it was essential that he
invent himself for public consumption. He nurtured and continually
remodelled his soignee image, surrounded by courtiers who literally
pandered to his wishes. They were the guardians of the Legend of the
Master both in his lifetime and after his death.
His life was in many ways an open book. Coward, who died in 1973, was
a major figure in the British theatre for decades, enjoying worldwide
celebrity. He wrote several volumes of memoirs and was extensively
written about. His godson, Sheridan Morley, wrote his biography, A
Talent to Amuse, in 1969, and in 1976, after the murder of John Pope
Hennesy, who was to have written the official biography, his valet,
secretary, and companion, Cole Lesley took on the chore, producing a
witty and informative book.
His lover, Graham Payn, once described by Noel as ''an illiterate
little sod'', produced his memoirs of their life together last year.
Coward's diaries have also been published. Is there room for yet another
biography?
The answer is yes, when it is as good as this book which, unlike all
the others, does not evade his sexuality. The actor, Roddy McDowell, met
him when he was reading the proofs of Morley's book and asked how it was
going? Coward said Sherry had to do a bit more work. ''There are still a
few old ladies in Worthing who don't know,'' he added. Well they do now.
But what everyone, including the old ladies, knows today is still
rumour, hearsay, and speculation. Philip Hoare's detailed account of
Coward's life puts paid to all that, placing the man and his work in its
proper context. The result is a fascinating chronicle of an outrageous
life and times.
Maybe one would have liked a little more critical insight into some of
the plays, and certainly a better catalogue of Coward's writings would
have been useful. The information is available elsewhere, but this is
the definitive biography and the index is not good enough.
Coward wrote two of the finest comedies in the English language, Hay
Fever and Private Lives, a fine operetta, Bitter Sweet, and composed
some enduring songs, comic and romantic, as well as creating that
legendary figure, the Master. One wonders how he would have viewed
Hoare's book because he was a true Edwardian for whom sex was a private
affair. One cannot imagine Coward turning out at a pink pageant in the
Albert Hall to sing for the cognoscenti in aid of Aids charities. Coward
had an extensive and predatory sex life, there being no point in being a
superstar if one could not have who one wanted, but sex was not
something one talked about.
To Hoare's credit the bedroom door remains firmly closed. There is no
need to know exactly what went on between Coward and his lovers, just
that they were other men and how the way the relationships developed
affected his work. His view of sex is surely summed up by Garry
Esendine, the actor-manager in Present Laughter he based on himself --
''To me the whole business is vastly overrated. I enjoy it for what it's
worth and intend to go on doing so for as long as anybody's interested,
and when the time comes that they are not I shall be perfectly content
to settle down with an apple and a good book.''
He had plenty of friendships with women, notably the actress Joyce
Cary and the designer Gladys Calthrop, some of whom, although not all,
were themselves gay. The strength of his friendship with Gertrude
Lawrence seems to have been, if anything, over-emphasised by both. Loyal
to those he loved, Coward tried repeatedly to transform Payn, his
partner of many years, into a West End star, a transformation which
resolutely refused to take place. Payn, talented though he was, remained
a frog.
It is possible to place too much emphasis on an artist's sexuality, to
proselytise too much, as those academics who pursue gay studies
sometimes do, but no artist's work can be properly viewed without being
placed in the context of the whole man. Hoare does this with the right
degree of reticence, which is to say the fact that Coward was homosexual
does not mean Private Lives is really a play about two sets of male
couples. It can, however, explain his approach to writing female roles,
and it does illuminate that troilist classic, Design for Living, as was
done with the most recent London production where the two men and one
woman partner-swopping over the years were revealed in all their
ambiguous sexuality, not simply played as glamorous, slightly decadent
society folk.
Given the fuss being kicked up currently about homosexuals serving in
the Royal Navy by the First Sea Lord one wonders what he would have made
of Coward, who for years used the senior service as his own private
cruise line. That he did is hardly surprising, given he could write
thank-you notes to Louis Mountbatten like this: ''Dear dainty Darling, I
couldn't have enjoyed my holiday more . . . Please be careful of your
zippers, Dickie dear, and don't let me hear of any ugly happenings at
Flotilla dances. Love and kisses, Bosun Coward.'' The First Sea Lord
might also have learned a thing or two about Portsmouth from Coward.
It is interesting that Coward, who became a super patriot in the
thirties with Cavalcade and during the war with In Which We Serve,
proved, as a young man during the First World War, adept at getting out
of having to serve. He was a man of many facets and contradictions.
Hoare reveals that the food in Coward's homes was seldom good, the
homes far from comfortable and furnished in poor taste. He is
enlightening on Coward's need to follow one hit play with another, his
determination to open another door when one closed, his relentless
social climbing, his chronic shortage of money, the way he looked after
his family, and on his ability to be a truly unforgiving foe. He kept a
little black book of offenders who were paid back in full. As well as a
talent to amuse he had a talent to destroy.
He was, which I did not know, half Scottish in origin, being descended
from the Veitches of Dawyk upon Tweed, and far better connected socially
than his of-humble-birth legend allowed. The Cowards were poor -- Violet
may have taken in lodgers, charred even, and pawned a diamond ring to
let young Noel go off for a paedophile weekend with some county nobs --
but they were not working class. Hoare does not demolish the legend, nor
does he diminish the man. He helps one understand how that talent to
amuse came about.

INTERESTING choice of phrases by the Prime Minister: factually
inaccurate, intellectually inconsistent, unbalanced, plain wrong. He was
talking, as it happens, about the Commonwealth leaders' statement on
French nuclear testing.
He could more credibly have been talking about UK defence policy.
It appears that the basis for Mr Major's intemperate backing of the
current French follies is the fact that they are a fellow member of our
nuclear club. Therefore we understand their problems and
responsibilities in owning and keeping operational a nuclear deterrent.
Yet arguably what we share with the French is something rather less
high-minded and certainly less logical: a persistent and irrational
belief that either nation can be a solo player in contemporary war
games. For either country to mortgage its fiscal soul in pursuit of such
a dangerous virility symbol is a complete nonsense.
The time-consuming wrangles over Bosnian policy underlined only too
clearly that neither the NATO alliance nor the European community is in
the business of unilateral initiatives. What matters, therefore, is the
collective will, the collective arsenal, the collective military
personnel. And Britain and France's contribution to these needs to be
complementary to the other parts of that collective defensive jigsaw.
The fact that both countries still cherish the illusion of acting in
any other capacity is a legacy of some of the less savoury facets of the
national characters. Chirac clearly fancies himself as some sort of
civilian De Gaulle, playing international poker with a jealously guarded
personal hand. Mr Major, one presumes, is attempting to echo the more
gung-ho pronoucements of his predecessor that Britannia can still
somehow, somewhere, some time, rule the waves.
Yet surely it is ''unbalanced'' at best to envisage a scenario when
either would unilaterally deploy a nuclear weapon. Unless the lunatics
really have taken over the asylum. Surely it is ''factually inaccurate''
to suggest that there can be no harm in further underground testing in
the South Pacific when the entire population of the area and every
government in that hemisphere is sufficiently alarmed by the risks
roundly to condemn the exercise.
It would have been interesting to witness the Western European
perspective on the matter if, for the sake of hypothesis, the antipodean
governments had decided that the Atlantic was the perfect test site for
a spot of nuclear adventuring of their own.
And, while we are at it, let us examine a few alternative
''intellectual inconsistencies''. Is it not inconsistent of a bit-part
player like Britain to commit so much of its overstretched resources to
the Trident submarine whose potential for deployment in the current
geopolitical world is almost impossible to discern, whose annual costs
even after completion of the fleet are horrendous, whose commissioning
caused the army and air force to cut back on the kind of resources which
are in demand in modern conflict, and which is anything but independent
in any event given its American parenthood and dependance on US
technology?
Just this week we learn that one of its immediate antecedents, a sub
in the Polaris fleet, is to be scrapped. Half a dozen years ago the MoD
sanctioned a #200m refit. Toys for the boys are an increasingly
expensive hobby.
Mr Major, it seems, was angered by the Commonwealth communique failing
to take note that the French would sign up to the test ban treaty next
year. And what a comfort that must be to average Polynesians as they
wait for the seas to churn, the earth to tremble, and their fishing
stocks to acquire some extra unsolicited ''nutrients''. What a comfort
to know that you have only to lie back and think of France a few more
times before the rapist goes home.
And is it not just a little ''intellectually inconsistent'' to rail
against nuclear proliferation, to condemn emergent nations who lust
after their own nuclear capability, yet stand in front of a microphone
defending the current members of the club when they demand a few more
outings with their own stocks just to ensure they're all still in
perfect working order? Don't do as we do, little people, do as we say.
But there are other concerns which in my view transcend the fiscal
folly and strategic dubiety of the French and British posturing. Is it
really too naive to suppose our politicians should concern themselves
with the morality of their defence policies? M Chirac might reflect that
opposition to his latest testing came from all corners of the globe,
including areas with no apparent interest in either the radioactive or
political fallout. From people who instinctively found it offensive that
France should play colonial power games with the health and wellbeing of
small dependencies. From people who are tired of world stability being
threatened by the macho politics of playground bullies.
M Chirac, in making the restoration of nuclear tests one of his first
presidential acts, presumably thought it would portray him as a man of
resolve and patriotic fervour. In the event, outside of Downing Street
and the more chauvinist Parisian circles, it made him seem foolhardy; a
man whose rampant egotism had badly skewed his political judgment.
Back in Britain, do not hold too much breath for new model Labour to
depart too radically from Mr Major's script if it wins the election.
Trident, it seems, must be safeguarded against all charges of Labour
being soft on defence. Not that anybody in the Labour Party seems any
clearer than the rest of us what exactly British nuclear submarines
carrying the ingredients for the Third World War are actually for. This
is the country which, after all, had some difficulty in saying boo to a
Nigerian goose, let alone making the smallest defensive move without
phoning uncle Bill first.
Can we be saving a quartet of Tridents in case, for some unimaginable
reason, we have to sail alone against that devastating Russian submarine
fleet? The one currently so powerful, modern and well-resourced that
it's getting final demands from the local electricity company? If so, if
we're mortgaging tomorrow's soul on account of a threat which was
uncertain even yesterday, then, to quote a prominent member of the
Commonweath, we've got it all wrong. Just plain wrong.

IMAGE and reality. Labour triumphs in the former and the Tories are
dogged by the latter. It is the developing dilemma of the coming General
Election, the conflicting claims of experience in power and the concept
of change.
At the risk of apeing the characteristically modest but hilarious
account by Spike Milligan of his part in defeating Hitler, let me tell
how I first came across the difference between image and reality.
Grander themes can await another day.
Turning 19, a newly commissioned subaltern (the lowest of the low), I
arrived for the next 14 months of my two-year National Service at a
battalion of Her Majesty's Royal West African Frontier Force in West
Africa. This was an adventure beyond any that Mr Tony Blair could
conceive. That part of the world was still known as ''The White Man's
Grave'', a title to which the tombstones bore plentiful witness.
I imagined that, save for an outbreak of the Third World War, the
chief danger to my life would be the plethora of tropical diseases
listed on those tombstones throughout what is now Ghana, but what was
still pre-independence Gold Coast 41 years ago. That was the image, not
without its romantic aspect -- I actually got the chance to go looking
for gold in that God-forsaken pre-air-conditioning climate, but
naturally found only the ''fool's''' variety.
I turned up for breakfast in a palatial officers' mess on my first
morning in my as yet unstarched new uniform such as you see the kids
wearing to parties these days. My knees, what you could see of them
below the long, baggy regulation shorts, were very white. As I was soon
to discover, I was also very green. A minor public boarding school did
not train me for what happened next, which was the reality of the Army
out there.
What had trained me, much as long years in opposition has trained
Labour, was two months' basic training in winter in the Brecon Beacons.
Image again, I had joined up in the South Wales Borderers with a view to
devoting my service to the Queen playing rugby. Reality: I learned that
when there is food around, scoff it quick.
I was halfway through my cornflakes and African (bantam) eggs when I
noticed that at the other, senior, end of the mess table were two old
Majors, veterans of the Indian Army. Their Denis Healey-type eyebrows
went up, their colossal moustaches bristled at the sight of my
relatively hearty breakfast at 6.45am.
The one turned to the other and observed in a barrack-square whisper
(which I subsequently learned to identify with Wille Whitelaw in a quiet
mood): ''My God, Majendie, I always thought that the only breakfast for
an officer and a gentleman was a lightly-boiled egg and a glass of
hock.''
You can imagine how this crushing remark by a regular officer, a real
soldier who had seen real action, has dogged me throughout life. The
words came back to me just the other day in fanciful form: ''My God,
Heseltine, I thought that the only honourable course to take on sleaze
and greed was to appoint Scott and Nolan, and now they say I, Major, got
it all wrong.'' The image of gallantry and the reality.
As I sneaked away from the mess table (a riposte, had I been capable
of one, would have been unthinkably impertinent), I did however click to
my very first piece of valuable observation. I noticed that if the
egg-and-hock routine was indeed a rule of honour, the two old Indian
Army sweats were defying it.
In front of them for their breakfast were two large glasses of brandy
and ginger ale. I observed subsequently that it was not until their
third round that they poured the spirits into their coffee. This, I
suppose, was the rigour of peacetime soldiering after the actual perils
of the Second World War. And the battalion colonel (2nd, Gold Coast
Regiment) was Irish, after all.
Image and reality. This week we have the Queen's Speech, opening the
new session of Parliament, and after that, the Budget. And after that,
next year, an election? The days of peacetime soldiering are over. The
Old Sweat, Major, takes on the fledgling, Blair. Neither hock nor brandy
will make much difference in the reality of who forms the next
government for the millennium.
I have not yet finished swinging the lamp. I learned very quickly from
the senior officers (who had done their time in the very nasty war in
Burma) that image can create a reality, specially if you wanted to dodge
the column. In that extreme climate even officers were supposed to
remain physically fit, and that meant volleyball and PT at 6am, before
the heat and humidity of the day.
I discovered that on Monday mornings a hangover could look very much
like malaria, although unlike the war in Burma, the Clydeside blitz was
not noted for this particular malady. Well, I ask you, who wants to play
volleyball at dawn on Mondays? They had plenty of other unpleasant ways
of keeping us fit.
It was the Daily Mirror that saved the likes of susceptible National
Servicemen like me. As well as the scantily-clad Jane cartoon strip, the
Mirror really cared for Servicemen, even amateur ones like me. They
launched a successful campaign exposing the danger of alcohol to
youngsters and the bad example being set by old sweats. If our mummies
didn't know the reality of our service to the nation before, the Mirror
certainly told them.
The result was that the Irish colonel was sent home and a new one
straight from the War Office (yes, his knees were white too) was sent
out to take over. Unfortunately his arrival at the mess coincided with
Sunday lunch, an orgy of curry and refreshments, still in full swing as
dusk was falling.
The very next day on Battalion Orders went up this immortal notice:
''No officer under the rank of field officer (majors and above) shall
drink spirits before sundown.'' This new colonel finished up in a
looney-bin in Bexhill-on-Sea, of course. I like to think of that order
as tolling the end of Empire.
I suppose it was also the end of my wide-eyed innocence. Reality bore
down on image with a vengeance. Why do I think of Mr Major and Mr Blair?

WITH regard to your reports about the proposed breakaway Socialist
Labour Party, supported by Arthur Scargill (November 9), I would wish to
distance the NUM Scotland Area from such sentiments which I accept were
made in a personal capacity and not in his position as president of the
NUM.
The NUM Scotland Area is proud to be, and remain, an affiliate of the
Labour Party and continues to play its part in forming the manifesto
which will be put forward by the Labour Party for the next General
Election in order that we can rid ourselves of this present Government
and return a Labour Government which will allow our retired and working
miners and their families to move on to a brighter and more secure
future.
As an organisation we have been fully supportive of the changes
proposed by the Labour Party for a Scottish assembly within the UK,
which would also give our members a bigger say in a more democratic way
in the running of this country.
I felt it was important that people should know and understand that
the NUM Scotland Area does not agree with the views expressed by Mr
Scargill.

MAY I make a few points of information regarding Sir Iain Noble's
plan, in the words of your heading, to ''hasten the end of tolls'' on
the Skye Bridge (November 10)?
The bridge is not a private bridge. There is a concession to a private
company to charge a toll.
CalMac (in which the Government is the majority shareholder) has been
steadily raising the ferry charges on the Kyle-Kyleakin run presumably
to meet the calculated payback target rate to charge on the bridge. That
target rate of course includes a profit to the Bank of America.
The Kyle-Kyleakin ferry service has been making a profit of #750,00 to
#1m a year for years (a figure not challenged by CalMac). That profit
has been used to subsidise the rest of CalMac's operation. The bridge
toll is not cheaper than a fair ferry rate would have been and it never
was intended to be.
Another of Sir Iain's ''plans'' intimated to me was that the tolls
should be two or even three times higher so that the bridge could be
paid off even more quickly!
Need I say more?
On the evidence of Sir Iain's letter and of his conversation with me,
the best that can be said is that he is an innocent fronting a system of
extortion devised by Government and friends.
What I say to everyone who has Skye and Lochalsh's best interest at
heart: Don't pay!

MR James Meikle believes that the people of Skye and Lochaber should
shut up and ''graciously'' pay their bridge dues (November 9).
He seems to believe that the bridge should not ''be financed from the
public purse'' or ''subsidised by the general taxpayer''.
Should he care to look out of his office window, he will see the
publicly financed, taxpayer-subsidised, Kingston Bridge.

ARMED with two buckets, some poly bags, and a shovel, I recently
visited Strathclyde Roads Department depot at Garscadden to uplift some
road salt for the driveway, knowing that the snow and ice of the dreaded
Scottish winter will soon be upon us. I have carried out this mission
for several years.
Bucket and shovel at the ready, I approached the road-salt mountain,
towering over me in a Siberian landscape. Not a soul in sight. Some
yellow grit bins shivered in the cruel winter sun.
A security guard approached and said I was not allowed to take any
road salt and I was on private property. I got no road salt.
As a good, wee council-tax payer, I would have thought a bucket or two
of road salt was my entitlement. There are no grit bins in my street and
the gritting lorry is seldom seen.
If I fall and break a limb this winter as I try to negotiate my
driveway, I intend to contact the European Court of Human Rights. After
all, they're fairly skilled in dealing with butter mountains and meat
mountains, so perhaps they could advise on road-salt mountains.
This action could be avoided were the director of roads to organise a
special delivery of the said road salt (buckets only, please) and throw
in a box of those chocolates that the lady loves. At least, he won't
miss his footing on the way out.

CHRISTIAN Aid could not agree more with Katherine Butler in her report
that ''it is trade not aid which will allow the Third World to catch
up'' (November 3).
While I am not minimising the importance of aid, long-term sustainable
progress will only be possible when developing countries are able to
expand their markets and get a fair price for their exports.
For most countries the relative value of exports to aid is huge even
where the main exports are primary commodities; aid only counts for 5%
of income in Third World countries whereas 82% comes from trade.
Because of the importance of trade to developing countries, Christian
Aid has for a number of years been campaigning on the issue of fair
trade and trying to highlight the importance of trade in development.
Europe is the largest trading bloc in the world and through the Lome
Convention can have a major impact on development in the poorest
countries. It is therefore vital that in this current round of talks
trade preferences are protected, not eroded, and targeted carefully at
the needs of the poor.

YOUR report (November 10) that our national church's Board of World
Mission has confirmed its decision to sell off the Scots Kirk in Paris,
in the year celebrating the 700th anniversary of the Auld Alliance, is
redolent with irony.
It is not possible here to raise all the questions that such a
decision provokes but pre-eminent among them must be: how does today's
Church of Scotland see its secular role, as a historical guardian of
Scotland's nationhood in contemporary Europe?
If such a role remains from pre-Union times, and I believe it should,
the fact that the Scots Kirk in Paris is the sole remaining emblem of
Scotland's separate identity in France must surely be weighed against
any short-term financial advantages that might accrue from selling it.
To fond Parisians it is still a surety that the Church and Nation of
Scotland still exist within a wider European spiritual and secular
context.
Other questions follow. Is it right that the Board of World Mission
should plan to apply elsewhere proceeds from a property that was
originally purchased for its present use with the aid of
disproportionately large contributions from Scots-American benefactors?
And, is it right (as opposed to being politically correct) that the
Church's spiritual witness should be given higher priority in Thailand
and in Africa than in Paris and Europe?
Through friends in Paris I know that an imaginative rescue plan is
being prepared that would involve replacing the present building with a
larger ''Maison d'Ecosse'' on the same central site adjoining the
Champs-Elysees.
This building would not only house the continuing Scots Kirk but would
provide separate facilities for other more wordly purposes of cultural
exchange and tourist promotion.
Perish the thought -- but there might even be a chance of making a
profit rather than a loss on the whole rescue enterprise!
Dare we hope that on reflection the Board of World Mission, instead of
washing its hands of this little piece of Scotland in France, joins
instead in mounting a massive fund-raising campaign not only to honour
at this poignant time the memory of Rev Donald Caskie, the Tartan
Pimpernel, whose courage was so inspirational to the French resistance
in the war; but for sustaining a continuing witness to its faithful and
devoted multinational congregation in Paris?

SOME clarification regarding Helen McLean's panels is required
(October 27 and November 2).
The Concert Hall had received numerous complaints from patrons about
the somewhat dowdy external approach to the hall. The Buchanan Street
site had lain empty for some years and it was considered that a series
of panels (120ft long) at the perimeter fence would brighten up that
approach and, at the same time, provide an excellent marketing
opportunity for the then seasonal theme of Trains and Boats and Planes.
Helen McLean was paid for her work at a figure of under #1500 per 24ft
panel, a very attractive price for so large a work. The project was
completed in spring, 1994, at which time the hall received notice that
the building work on the Buchanan site was likely to commence shortly.
So, rather than have the panels displayed on the site for a short period
and risk damage, consideration to erecting the work inside the hall was
undertaken.
During the period in which a suitable internal site was being sought
and prepared, the panels were carefully stored and not, as the article
stated, dumped in an inappropriate location. It is also noteworthy that
Helen Mclean personally supervised the arrival and subsequent storage of
the panels herself, took photographs of her works, and at no point
expressed any concern verbally or in writing about the housing of her
work.
The Concert Hall exhibits a great deal of valuable artworks on a
regular basis and its expertise in these matters has never been called
into question.
Helen McLean's panels will be erected inside the hall in March, 1996,
when the Trains and Boats and Planes them re-appears. This will coincide
with the first visit to the British Isles of an exhibition from the
great Vasa Museet in Stockholm on the subject of the Scottish and
Swedish Navies, and an exhibition on the 50th anniversary of the
launching of the Waverley.
The actions taken by the Concert Hall have all been based on ensuring
that even greater exhibition space is made available for the enjoyment
of the people of Glasgow.

ACCORDING to Walter T Hogg the permissive sixties laid the foundations
for today's delinquent parents and children (November 9). I don't
disagree with that assertion or that caring responsible parents produce
families similar to themselves.
All the virtues expounded in his letter are desirable for a stable
society But Mr Hogg fails to say how this can be achieved or how to
reverse the current trend.
Instead he chooses to challenge my suggestion of National Service
(abolished) incidentally at the start of the permissive sixties) which I
still maintain helped to eliminate or at last minimise delinquent
tendencies.
As one would guess, I served in HM Forces and can state categorically
that one visit to MCTC Colchester (the glasshouse) was sufficient to
bring the hard-men under control.
Delinquency in some instances is an apprenticeship for a life of
crime. If the legislators fail to deal with matters today then what of
tomorrow? Vigilantes? State police? Storm troopers? Or what? The longer
it is tolerated the more stringent the eventual action required.

I SEE from your columns that the greyheids and wrinklies have started
bashing ''young people today'', for their alleged refusal to conform. D
W Smith (November 4) and Walter T Hogg (November 9) bewail their
aberrant modes of behaviour.
This argument seems to surface about every 15 or 20 years as the
complainers reach that age when they are on the slow march to the grave.
Walter Hogg betrays himself when he speaks of ''lumpen adolescents'' who
apparently are ''outwith anyone's control''. There appears to be a
patronising ring to his letter.
National Service in the armed forces is designed for one purpose only,
that is to kill the Queen's enemies, or kill on the orders of a senior
officer. Scots teenagers have been killing people in every continent in
the world from the 1680s until the 1990s. Let us hope that is the end of
it.
I was glad to hear that the Scots-based regiments are almost defunct
and that the English-based regiments are scrabbling around for recruits.
It shows a sea change for the better.
I was recently re-reading contemporary reports of the English Civil
War when some of Cromwell's generals were expressing the very sentiments
being put forth by Messrs Smith and Hogg, so nothing has changed in 300
years.
These same generals went on to slice off Charles I's head on bogus
charges, the usual hypocrisy of the middle-aged.

YOUR report, Child agency ''costs taxpayer millions'', is misleading
(November 2).
The #24m mentioned relates only to savings to taxpayers in cases where
the parent with care ceased to receive Income Support as a direct result
of the agency arranging maintenance.
In fact, in 1994/95, the CSA saved taxpayers in total some #479m that
would otherwise have been paid in social security benefits.
It is also very misleading to try to draw comparisons between the CSA
and the pre-CSA Liable Relatives Unit as the nature and organisation of
the work the agency does has greatly changed in comparison with the
previous system.
Overall the CSA is proving to be a very cost-effective operation.
During its first three years, if it achieves this year's target, the
agency will have collected or arranged more than #500m in maintenance
and have saved the taxpayer #1400m in reduced social security
expenditure.
This will compare with operating costs over the same period of around
#514m.

AS an independent, unsubsidised, Glasgow-based book publishing company
we requested details and rules of the 1995 Booker Prize for fiction from
Book Trust Book House, 45 East Hill, London, SW18 2QZ.
The prize is worth #20,000 and the conditions of award are as follows:
Any eligible book which is entered for the prize shall not qualify for
the award unless its publisher agrees to spend not less than #1000 on
direct, paid-for media advertising of the winning book, including a
winning poster or showcard, within the three months following the
announcement of the award; agrees to contribute #2000 towards general
publicity if the book reaches the shortlist, and agrees to comply with
rule 4g (submitting two copies of each shorlisted book for leather
binding).
Not having either the #2000 necessary to reach the shortlist or the
further #1000 should we actually win the prize, we decided not to submit
our latest novel title, The White Rose, by JD Hunter, about the
resistance movement by young Germans against Hitler in 1942.
We have learned that the prize had been won by a woman writer dealing
with, among other things, male genitalia in the trenches of the First
World War.
Have our literary prize sponsors -- McVitie, Saltire, Hawthornden,
James Tait Black Memorial, Scottish Arts Council -- anything to learn
from London?

IN THE golden haze of youth, thank goodness, we are shielded from
thoughts of the ultimate fate by an unshakable belief in our own
immortality. Age is for the aged, a distant horizon to be reached by
other people but not by us. It was ever so -- and what a clever trick of
nature to provide such an incentive for living.
Time alone changes the perspective, though I came to it much earlier
than most because of that early heart problem which might have limited
my days on earth.
Each day has been a bonus therefore, sharpening the appreciation of
all around me and leaving only a lingering thought which most of us
ponder from time to time: How long am I likely to live?
On the basis that heredity is a strong guide, doctors are always
interested in your parents. At what age did they die? What was the
cause? Even more so, they are interested in grandparents because that
gives an even broader background for genetic study.
The grandparents gave me hope. Apart from the paternal grandfather,
who died early from an anthrax infection contracted from one of his
cattle, my prospects seemed good. One grandmother reached her nineties,
the other her eighties.
Sadly, my parents didn't have that kind of luck. So for many years I
have had at the back of my mind a target -- to surpass the lifespan of
my mother, which was 64 years and 100 days.
Having long calculated that that target would be reached on October
16, 1995, I would find myself indulging in crazy mathematics. By that
time I would have lived for 23,476 days -- or 563,424 hours. The old
heart, for all its faults, would have pounded out more than two billion
beats.
When the day arrived last month I happened to be strolling on a golden
beach in North Carolina, inhaling the fresh breeze of the Atlantic as it
tempered the 85 degrees of a glorious sunshine. What a day to be alive!
How much fitter I was at 64 years and 100 days than I had been at 16.
As someone once said, if I had known I was going to live this long I
would have taken better care of myself! In all truth, I have looked
after myself not too badly, as confirmed in a recent health check,
though we cannot anticipate the unexpected departure.
Whereas my mother almost certainly shortened her life through heavy
smoking, I had at least learned that lesson.
The beauty of all this, I was saying over a drink on that target
night, is the uncertainty of the lifespan. (It was clearly a time for
cliches!)
Next day I was heading for New York when I picked up the Wall Street
Journal and read a front-page story of what must surely be regarded as
startling significance. It was all about a man of exactly my own age who
had not yet plucked up the courage to open a letter which had been lying
on his desk for weeks.
Within that envelope, the scientists are saying fairly confidently, is
a prediction which should tell him with a new-found accuracy about when
he will die.
It comes from a breakthrough at the Rockefeller University, New York,
where they seem to have made inroads on a set of mysterious genes which
roughly determine how long we'll live.
For years the scientists thought that the protein produced by a gene
called Apo E was there simply to shuttle cholesterol around the body.
Now they believe it is of much greater importance than that.
With so many people now living into their eighties, scientists have a
far better chance to study the diseases of old age. The significance of
Apo E is that it apparently affects people's susceptibility to those
diseases.
In other words, it largely controls our lifespan. This does not, of
course, take account of the unnatural causes of death, which range from
accident and viruses to the effects of smoking or drinking, by which we
hasten our own end.
Given that we avoid those causes, however, the scientists believe they
are close to cracking the measure of our natural time on earth.
''This is absolutely amazing,'' said Dr Jan Breslow, head of
biochemical genetics at Rockefeller University. ''Most of the genes we
talk about these days are those that cause disease. But here we have a
variant of a normal gene which seems to be a marker for survival.
If the tests finally prove this theory beyond all doubt, Dr Breslow
believes that within a few years we'll have a panel of genes with which
we can predict life expectancy.
It is an intriguing business. But can you blame the chap who has left
that envelope lying on his desk? Do we really want to know?
When I talked to George Fraser, my former editor in Aberdeen who
figured in this column last week, he recalled that he had been rejected
for the First World War because of a weak heart.
I remembered my own heart ailment of youth but gained much optimism
from the example of George. After all, although he was not encouraged to
anticipate a long life, he celebrated his 100th birthday on Friday --
and assured me that he is in the very best of health.

NIGERIA is rightly condemned on all sides for the trial by military
tribunal and subsequent execution of nine minority rights activists.
What is less clear is the effectiveness of the proposed retaliatory
measures in bringing Nigeria to a position in which the rule of law and
democracy can be established. The Commonwealth has reacted sensibly by
suspending Nigerian membership and by insisting that expulsion would
follow in two years if democracy was not installed. Unfortunately it
would be idle to expect that this will have much of an effect on the
Nigerian leadership. The simple fact is that the sale of oil keeps
Nigeria afloat and that as long as oil sales are allowed to continue to
bring in some $7000m annually, much of which is diverted into the
pockets of the military rulers and their civilian henchmen, there is
very little prospect of anything changing in Nigeria unless General Sani
Abacha and his colleagues wish it.
In this respect the reaction of Mr Major and of the White House to the
suggestion of an oil embargo is difficult to understand. It is true that
an oil embargo would not be easy to arrange, and would in any case have
to be conducted through the offices of the United Nations. But Mr Major,
although careful not to hedge himself in, suggested that an embargo
would harm the ordinary people of Nigeria. All available evidence
suggests that the major harm would be to the pockets of the Nigerian
Establishment which has so ingeniously filched the revenues from the
state for many years. The people do not really enter the equation,
although cynics will suspect that the heavy involvement of British,
American, French, and Italian firms in the Nigerian oil business has a
certain relevance.
Unfortunately, while the departure of General Abacha and the military
from power would be a welcome event, there are no guarantees of what
might succeed them. In terms of decent, fair government Nigeria has been
a disaster since the day she was born. Military despots of varying
degrees of awfulness have been interspersed by short-lived, corrupt and
rapacious civilian administrations. Africa's most populous country has
been ill-served by almost all of those who have professed public
service. That is a sad fact, but it shows that only clear and inventive
thinking can ever hope to be of help.

NOTHING could be better than news of progress on the Northern Ireland
peace process, but nothing would be worse than a significant abandonment
of the principles which must form the foundation of any peace settlement
worthy of the name. This is not to say that there should be a lack of
flexibility in the way negotiations are conducted; any suggestions of
that sort should be treated with caution as they almost certainly
proceed from those whose commitment to the process is less than warm.
Nevertheless, there are areas of considerable importance where
principles must be maintained. The Irish Prime Minister, Mr John Bruton,
is understandably anxious about the unfortunate state of limbo into
which the peace progress has fallen. He is not alone in this but his
method of registering anxiety publicly is ill-timed. There is undeniable
worry about the discovery of the huge bomb near the Irish border last
Friday, almost certainly intended for Northern Ireland and thankfully
intercepted by the Garda, but as the bomb originated with a peripheral
if murderous group it is difficult to take it as a finely-targeted
threat to the ceasefire. It has been used, though, as a reason for
heightening the sort of rhetoric from Ireland which is designed to
pressure Mr Major and the Government to soften or even abandon their
insistence on progress towards taking weapons out of the hands of the
IRA.
This is the core of the matter and it should not be forgotten or
glossed over. It is simply not reasonable to expect immediate all-party
talks and negotiations involving Sinn Fein to begin while the IRA holds
large stocks of weapons and explosives and when there is no mechanism
for even beginning to deal with this fact. Mr Bruton is keen for an
Anglo-Irish summit before President Clinton's visit to Britain and
Ireland at the end of the month. This is a sensible idea because,
although it is known that British and Irish officials are in touch on a
daily basis and that the two Prime Ministers speak regularly, it is
important that Mr Major and Mr Bruton have a clear and unambiguous
understanding of each other's position before Mr Clinton arrives. True,
the last summit was cancelled because the Irish government discovered
that it could not convince Sinn Fein to agree to an international
commission on the arms question, but that commission is still the best
way forward. Sinn Fein's refusal to countenance the commission must be
explored again; if its refusal is maintained it is that which must be
clearly and publicly identified as the substantive bar to progress on
peace.

To some the current wife of Macbeth is shocking and provocative. To
SARA VILLIERS, she gives a gripping and enthralling performance.
IT'S Bubbles without the fizz. The press like to characterise Jane
Horrocks as slightly eccentric but the actress has little in common with
her Absolutely Fabulous character apart from a vague horror of office
technology. ''No, I don't have a fax,'' she says wrinkling her nose in
disgust. The nose is pretty mobile throughout the interview.
On screen she's the PR PA who is easily perplexed, the verbally
dyslexic fashion victim who puts the ''um'' into dumb. Off screen she's
smart and pretty straightforward, she's certainly not given to sartorial
kookiness. Bubbles might favour a powder blue puffball skirt with a
tennis racquet accessory but Horrocks's only flamboyance is one pale
pink ribbon, in recognition of breast cancer awareness month, pinned
neatly to her black frockcoat.
The contrast means that she can stroll into the Dome Cafe in Islington
unrecognised but heads soon swivel when she opens her mouth. That
distinctive croaky northern accent is the Horrocks trade mark,
stubbornly unchanged throughout periods at RADA and the RSC and
currently to be heard on the new Channel 4 animated soap, Crapston
Villas. Interviewers frequently marvel at Horrocks's voice, so
bewildered by the speed at which she talks that they often characterise
her as something of a curio, but the verbal gush seems pretty normal to
anyone familiar with Glaswegian patter.
Characteristically, she has retained her accent while playing Lady
Macbeth in a controversial production directed by and featuring the
dynamic Mark Rylance. The production by Phoebus Cart, which opens
Glasgow's Theatre Royal tonight, opened at the Greenwich Theatre in
London to near dismissive reviews. Rylance's performance was praised but
his radical interpretation was almost unanimously deemed unpalatable by
the capital's critics.
Rylance has set the action in a cult. Nearly all the cast wear baggy,
orange robes, and apart from Macduff, the men have shaven heads. Macduff
is a tall rangy New Age traveller type with a grungy wife and
son.Horrocks' Lady Macbeth is ruled more by impulse than scheming
machinations.
''I think the audience are a bit taken aback when they see the
costumes,'' she admits. But she insists that the production is a
particularly accessible one because of Rylance's encouragement of a
conversational tone. ''I think people get a bit surprised by how easily
they can understand it and that's just because people are speaking
normally.
''Intense preparation allowed the cast the opportunity to explore not
only their own character but also everyone else's. Not doing the lines
but walking about the room for 20 minutes or so, sort of being the
characters,'' explains Horrocks. ''We discussed their motives and what
animals they were like and what people they were like.''
The inspiration for her Lady Macbeth, she divulges, was Edwina Currie.
''To the public Edwina Currie is always doing all that'' -- she makes
the face, twitches that nose, and bats her eyelashes -- ''little girl
lost look and 'aren't I a lovely person' but we know the reality is
incredibly ambitious. But I think that she is someone who has a lot of
vulnerability. You know that she's quite scared under that sort of
vixenish behaviour.''
She compares Currie's reaction to the salmonella crisis to Lady
Macbeth's reaction to her husband's revelations about the Weird Sisters'
prophesies. ''Well, she launched into that eggs thing so much and did
such a number on it and then it all backfired and I thought it was quite
like that for Lady Macbeth. She sort of launches into this thing
thinking it's going to make their lives so much better and then she
realises that it doesn't make them happier.''
That realisation is compounded with dreadful force in the sleepwalking
scene, which Horrocks acts with almost unbearable pathos, shuffling on
to the stage in a white vest and pants, looking like a frightened little
girl. It's a very uncomfortable image, disturbing in its evocation of
fragility.
''I thought that she was diving back into childhood because she wants
to get back to God, to get back to that innocence when your mind is not
cluttered with sins. And I wanted to see her completely out of
control.'' Horrocks pauses and sips her hot chocolate. ''That's why I
did the peeing thing.''
Ah yes, the peeing thing. Horrocks urinates on stage during the
sleepwalking scene, thrusting her hand between her legs as she does so,
thus giving an added piquancy to the line, ''All the perfumes of Arabia
will not sweeten this little hand.''
The peeing has been the subject of a great deal of press interest. At
first Horrocks played up to it, joking to an interviewer that sometimes
it's only: ''A boring old p*** but sometimes it comes flooding out like
a horse, which is excellent.'' But now she's getting peeved about the
inordinate attention on her urinary flourish.
''It's been seized on by people who haven't seen it. I'm p***** off by
people seizing on the sensational aspects. I wanted to do something
which would be disturbing and which would connect with the scene and I
think it does because a lot of kids wet their beds at night or when
they're sleepwalking because they're not in control. At this point she's
totally out of control,'' she says. ''Anyway, if a guy was peeing on
stage no one would bat an eyelid.''
She registers slight irritation but the fascination with her bodily
functions does not really phase a woman who memorably played a gravelly
voiced anorexic who covered herself in chocolate for a grotesque sex
scene in the Mike Leigh film Life is Sweet. She would like to work with
Leigh again and she is committed to the British film industry but has no
interest in pursuing Hollywood, perhaps as keenly aware that she is not
starlet fodder as much as she is dismissive about the lack of creativity
over there.
She points out that if there is a film version of AbFab -- Jennifer
Saunders is rumoured to be working on a script -- then it will be
produced in Britain. But she is scathing about the prospect of an
American television version, pointing out their puritanism about the
drinks and drugs will suck the life out of it.
Horrocks has recently been described as one of Britain's best liked
actresses -- a perception she giggles in embarrassment over and puts
down to people responding favourably to the honesty of her accent. She
is rumoured to be quite an obsessive type in theatrical circles,
supposedly keeping a scrapbook of every review, yet it is difficult to
imagine her being obsessed with her image, so evident is her disdain for
''luvvie behaviour''.
Discussing coming to the Theatre Royal, which she is very much looking
forward to, Glasgow being a favoured party city since she worked there
last year during filming of the BBC Scotland short film Nightlife, she
comments in wonder about the fact that she will have her own dressing
room at the theatre. ''I'm not so sure about that, I'm used to sharing
with the girls,'' she laughed. ''I bet we'll all just squash into the
smallest room there, 'cos that's what we're used to. They'll probably
think we're really weird.''
But, for all the kinky sex scenes, the urinating on stage and the mad
AbFab costumes one suspects that Jane Horrocks is not half as weird as
she is made out to be. In fact, she's really quite nice.

IT HAS been a dreadful week for the State of Israel and as Shiva, the
seven-day period of mourning for Yitzhak Rabin, drew to a close at the
weekend it seems certain that more shocks are in store. The revelation
that the Shin Bet security service was told in advance of the plot to
assassinate Mr Rabin, and that it was even given an (admittedly sketchy)
description which matches the assassin is disturbing news for a nation
which relies on its security services more than most.
Equally shocking for many Israelis is the allegation that the plot
against Mr Rabin included soldiers from elite military units. Liberal,
democratic and sophisticated Israel has been forced by the events of
recent days to face up to the fact that Israeli society has changed more
than it suspected; somehow it must come to terms with this fact and
begin to seek ways to re-assert the proper values on which the state was
founded in 1948.
Central to this aim should be an immediate attempt to develop a clear
understanding of the religious right which has been a growing minority
in the country in recent years. The Israeli Establishment adopted
different ways of approaching this phenomenon: the centre-right Likud
tried to use the religious right but was used by them while Labour
simply ignored them. Both tactics were hopelessly wrong. Somewhat
belatedly there is now a recognition that as much effort should have
been expended on analysing the religious right as analysing Islamic
fundamentalism.
A start has now been made with the acknowledgement publicly that many
of the more dangerous extremists on the right emigrated from the United
States and still have a considerable support system there. Some Israeli
politicians believe that the Law of Return might have to be changed to
prevent extremists settling in Israel. This is too extreme for the
moment but it illustrates thankfully that some serious thinking has
begun.

From the time Gene Hackman saw his first movie he wanted to be an
actor. Douglas Thompson discusses his burning need and the rollercoaster
ride to his latest thriller just released in Scotland.
GENE Hackman recalls realising he had career problems when he found
himself in bed with Liza Minnelli and Burt Reynolds during the filming
of an alternative ending to Lucky Lady. This was during what he calls
his ''seduction by Hollywood'' period, and the man who has established
himself since as one of America's finest actors admits: ''I sold out for
the money''.
But what a lot of money. He made Lucky Lady -- his biggest flop -- and
14 other films in six years, collecting several million dollars a time.
He turned down the role which won Peter Finch a posthumous Oscar for
Network to make twice the money in the sorrowful Foreign Legion fillip
March or Die for Lew Grade.
Then there was the Jack Nicholson Oscar-winning lead in One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest and the Richard Dreyfuss role in Close Encounters,
both of which he rejected for dollar fodder. Today, older and more
sanguine, Hackman with a quiet grin on that potato that is his face
said: ''You have to ignore those things just as you have to ignore the
fact that other actors have turned down the roles you're playing.''
Now, he turns down the roles other actors end up playing. Two years
ago he won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his evil sheriff Little
Bill Daggett in Eastwood's Unforgiven but that didn't slow him down. He
ploughed on -- taking it easy for him is making three films a year --
starring in The Quick and The Dead with Sharon Stone and this month's
hi-tech-and-thrills nuclear submarine spectacular Crimson Tide with
Denzel Washington.
The jolly jinks comic thriller Get Shorty, based on Elmore Leonard's
novel and co-starring John Travolta and Danny DeVito, has just opened in
America. So, he's taking a break? You get a cash register grin. At
present he's in rehearsals for Birds of a Feather which is the Hollywood
version of La Cage aux Folles. His is an extraordinary work ethic.
He was born in California, brought up in Illinois. ''My father never
made enough money to buy a house of our own or even rent one, so we
lived with my grandmother.'' At 16, pumped up by tales of wartime
heroism, he joined the Marines and served in China and around the
Pacific Rim. He started a journalism course at the University of
Illinois but dropped out in favour of New York.
''From the time I saw my first movie as a boy, I wanted to be an
actor. I loved Cagney, he was so different from anything I'd ever seen,
having been brought up in a small Midwestern town. Cagney was New York,
tough-looking, wise-guy and cocky, totally on top of just about
everything a Midwesterner wasn't.
''I never tried to ape him but as a young performer I realised why I
liked him -- he was the consummate actor.''
Hackman bounced around radio stations working as a DJ in New York and
then Florida and then Manhattan again, before going West to his
birthplace and enrolling in the Pasadena Playhouse where he became
friendly with a rather unorthodox actor named Dustin Hoffman. They went
back to New York together.
At 65, Hackman has long since shed his demons. He was a late starter
and, at 30, was doing walk-ons on Broadway at night and selling shoes
during the day. ''The guys doing the casting saw me as too ordinary, too
much the average Joe. There were some very lean years.''
They started to get meatier in 1964 when he worked with Warren Beatty
and the late Jean Seberg in Lilith. Two years later, when Beatty was
casting Bonnie and Clyde, he gave the role of Buck Barrow to Hackman. He
gave the rube Buck, as capable of murder as his brother Clyde, a sort of
uncontained innocence which made his death not his reward but his
tragedy.
Nine movies later -- over just four years -- came The French
Connection with his street-vulgar Popeye Doyle obsessively hunting a
French heroin dealer. The role won him stardom and a Best Actor Oscar.
''That night was like a dream. It was like I was standing in the back of
the theatre and watching it through a lot of smoke. I just floated from
my seat.''
When the dream sequence ended he went into overdrive with a string of
films which he wove into a noose. They included the popcorn Poseidon
Adventure, The Domino Principle and Superman.
He explains with hindsight: ''I did the poor boy thing. I was very
determined to be successful. I had a number of houses and cars and
airplanes. It was like the empty barrel that doesn't have a bottom to
it. There were things I wanted to do. I ended up lying around.
''I lost enthusiasm for the business, not for acting. The business is
ugly. There's so much money involved, it's corrupt. As an artist you
want to open up. As a businessman you have to keep your guard up. Being
around artists brings out the best in you. Being around businessmen . .
.
''I had gotten depressed after a couple of my pictures didn't make
money and I started to say: 'Hell, I'll do pictures that'll definitely
make money and then I'll have plenty of dough'. It was real
establishment thinking and of course it didn't work.
''It scared me when I accepted the role in Superman. I walked on the
set in London and there was Chris Reeve in this skin-tight blue suit and
red cape. I looked at him and thought I had really done the ultimate act
and committed suicide.''
But critics and audiences like his maniacal cartoon take on Lex Luthor
and Hackman, with reflection, says he came to like the character. So
much so he reprised Luthor in two more Superman movies. There were
important moments like Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation and the
dark private-eye mystery Night Moves which was also distinguished for
being the film debut of Melanie Griffith.
Hackman seemed to get lost. ''I was tired. I couldn't get myself
motivated to work. I wanted to do repertory theatre. There wasn't a
repertory theatre in my town. It was a lot of fantasy.''
He and his wife Fay -- they had been married for 30 years and have
three children -- divorced officially in 1986 but that was just the
paperwork. The marriage had been stretched long before that.
''You become very selfish as an actor. You spend so many years wanting
desperately to be recognised as having the talent and then when you are
starting to be offered these parts, it's very tough to turn down
anything. Even though I had a family I took jobs that would separate us
for three, four months at a time.''
With his second wife Betsy Arakawa he lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico,
and the Georgia O'Keefe landscapes there are a proven haven for those
trying to put the second part of their life together.
''I moved out there because I do a little painting, and there's lots
of galleries there and a lot of people who are involved in cultural
aspects. There's a world-class opera and symphony orchestra. My wife is
a classical pianist so we have a nice life there.''
But when?
Hackman still hates to say ''no'' to work. ''I like the idea of
scripts being sent to me where I can have something new and different to
work on.''
If there is a moment of Hackman's career renaissance after his success
burn-out it would be Under Fire. He played a seasoned, cynical foreign
correspondent in search of a ''nice war, nice hotel, good shrimp'' and
it got close to as good as it gets. His co-star was Nick Nolte who has
20-20 personality vision.
He saw Hackman this way: ''It was real interesting working with him.
Gene was just at a certain period when he had been real big in American
film. He had gone through a little bit of a crisis and I think he just
really decided to do the films he wanted to do. He wasn't going to be
swept away by the idea that you have to have hits, you have to do this,
do that. And ever since he's been doing all those great films. Great
characters. He's a good actor.''
And still a busy one. ''I know it sounds as though I've been awfully
busy but I can't say I planned it that way. I don't have a career
strategy as such. It's got nothing to do with my career management. I
can't get involved in movie scheduling -- it's just that a lot of my
films come out at the same time.
''But I'm not complaining. I'm lucky I'm at an age when I can be cast
as a character type or a leading man. I can take third or fourth roles
and not be damaged by that. I like doing it. It takes some of the burden
off.
''I suppose people see me as someone they can live vicariously
through. They see me as the common man. I look like their uncle or their
brother or something. .''
Hackman gives a heroic performance in Crimson Tide which is an
ear-splitting techno thriller, a Tom Clancy-wannabe. This is a
high-testosterone boys-and-their-toys movie. ''We're capable of
launching more firepower than has ever been released in the history of
war,'' declares Hackman's submarine Captain Frank Ramsey adding: ''Hope
you enjoyed the peace because now we're back in business.''
Directed by Britain's Tony Scott (Top Gun, Days of Thunder), the movie
is close-ups on sweaty brows, nose-to-nose acting and tangible tension.
It's a commercial confection which crackles, especially during the
confrontation scenes between Hackman and his less-macho subordinate
Denzel Washington.
It was one of this year's major movies in America, another Hackman
hit. He nearly didn't make it. He read the script for Outbreak (which
finally starred his friend Dustin Hoffman) at the same time as Crimson
Tide. He dithered: ''I thought that Outbreak was gonna be a better film
but I thought that this film, for me, would be a better character.''
And lots of close-ups. What did he think?
''Jeez, your hair is really getting thin. And you've got that thing
under your neck here and there's lots of funny little white hairs
stickin' up. You know all kinds of funny little vain things that don't
really have to do with acting.''
Gene Hackman has a great deal to do with that.

MY FRIEND Ruth is pregnant again. Two or three months ago, as part of
an ongoing campaign to ensure that in 10 years or so I'm not the only
menopausal mother at the primary school gates, I told her she ought to
have another one. This, she now tells me, coincided nicely with a ''wee
notion'' she had of her own.
It is a notion to which the mothers of three or four are, I find,
surprisingly susceptible. I was myself. Logic would suggest that the
more ghastly each pregnancy becomes, the more unendurable the symptoms,
the more decrepit your poor, child-abused body, the more -- in short --
you know what it's like, the less likely you would be to want to go
through with it ever again. But logic has precious little to do with the
child-bearing business.
One friend has had five children in fewer than seven years and is
already calculating where she'll put the sixth. Another one has six
already and explains: ''Yes, I know every pregnancy's got worse, but you
see, every baby's got better.''
This is a common theme among mothers-of-many. Somehow, amid the
discomforts and fatigue and engulfing mayhem of an expanding family, we
manage to enjoy each baby just a little bit more than the one before.
I'm sure this is because, being basically sane and rational folk, we are
convinced from, say, number two or three onwards, that this is the
absolute last. We love it with all the passion reserved for a joy we
know to be fleeting. Who understands better than we how quickly this
soft, complaisant butterball will become a snotty, whingeing toddler?
Instead of urging this one on, as we did the first, to ever higher
feats of development, agonising over how long he's taking to sit up or
crawl or hold a spoon, we revel in what we fancy are the never-to-be
repeated pleasures of infancy. ''This is the last time a tiny downy head
will coorie into my neck,'' we sigh, as the milky-breathed bundle
snuggles into that nook in the shoulder that's just made for babies.
''Never again will I bask in that gummy grin,'' we sob when the first
tooth appears.
Then, of course, we have another one. I suppose it's all that
savouring of unrepeatable pleasures that compels you to repeat them. And
so the process continues, until you finally call a halt when the husband
threatens divorce, or you realise you'll be drawing child benefit at the
same time as your old age pension.
I dare say every woman would stop at one child if it were not for the
almost total amnesia that sets in after pregnancy is over. I imagine the
propagation of the species would have all but ceased in this generation
if any woman actually remembered afterwards what it felt like to carry a
child for nine months.
As my friend Ruth moaned down the phone the other day: ''I don't know
why on earth I ever have these wee notions.'' I distinctly remember her
saying much the same thing three times before. I said it myself. Once
you're pregnant, you can't for the life of you remember why you wanted
to be. I recall being rather shocked once when a friend who was
expecting a baby at last after two miscarriages said from the depths of
her nausea that she wished she wasn't.
But if you've never been there, or you're one of those lucky women who
''bloom'' all the way through, it's hard to appreciate how awful it can
be. I'm still close enough to the last one to remember the never-ending
nausea, the foot-dragging tiredness, the superhuman effort of will it
took to go to work, drag a trolley round Tesco, feed the children, wash
the clothes, monitor the homework, read some interminable Noddy bedtime
story, climb in and out of innumerable bunks for cuddles and smile
brightly at the unexpected guest who's turned up for the night -- when
all you want is to be sick and go to sleep.
Then there are the multifarious discomforts so casually dismissed in
the medical books as ''minor irritants''. Cramps. Spots. Wind. Hair as
tough as a lavatory brush. Tights falling down. People complimenting you
on your nice, round face. Stuffed-up nose. Urine sample leaking all over
your handbag -- (this one not in the textbooks, but ought to be on the
grounds of the extreme psychological stress when you pull out a soggy
cheque book in the supermarket).
Aware that we're suffering like this for an ultimately joyful reason
and that many women who would love to be pregnant can't, we try to rise
above it. We don't complain -- much. Barely able to stand up under the
waves of 24-hour nausea, we refrain from hitting the midwife when she
says kindly: ''Have you tried a dry biscuit first thing in the
morning?'' We part with #25 for arcane homeopathic powders. We wear
silly wrist bands with bumps that are supposed to make contact with
pressure points and ease queasiness. They don't. We either eat nothing
at all or, in my case, have to eat more or less constantly to stop being
sick.
(Presenting a morning television news programme and haunted by the
fear of throwing up on the breakfast tables of the nation, I used to
smuggle handfuls of nuts into the studio, stuffing them into my mouth
when the camera was elsewhere. ''Magnusson's on the peanuts again,'' the
whisper would zip round the newsroom. ''Must be expecting.'')
Who in her right mind would go through it twice out of choice, never
mind three, four, five, six times? But nature's little amnesia ploy is
so sneaky that within a few months of the birth (the horrors of which
are also struck so fast from the memory that we can be describing it as
''not a bad labour'' five minutes after 10 hours of hell) we are already
starting to wonder what all the fuss was about. My husband has learned
to back away fast when he hears me musing about what's a little
sickness, after all.
Thanks goodness I've remembered again.

When parents are pre-deceased by a child, the natural order is torn
apart. Joan McFadden and Jennifer Cunningham have spoken to parents
affected by this most shocking of traumas and find support networks are
growing.
''To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under
the heaven: a time to be born, and a time to die . . . a time to mourn
and a time to dance . . .''
WE ALL have a desire for natural order in our lives, which provides a
certain amount of preparation for the traditional rituals. There is
comfort in believing that for most of us, birth and death will simply
mark the beginning and end of a long life.
This belief is shaken to the core by the death of a child, whether
baby or adult. The agony of bereavement is intensified by guilt,
overwhelming feelings of injustice, and a sense that the normal order of
events has not been followed.
David and Mary have two healthy children, John (4) and Emma (six
months). Mary's mother died before the children were born and she will
always carry a sense of loss that they never knew their grandmother. It
is very hard, especially at vulnerable times such as during pregnancy,
not to be able to turn to her mother for support, but never more so than
two years ago, when David and Mary's second son died in her womb.
''I had gone for my AFP test, and the results showed that there was a
one in 15 chance that the baby had Down's Syndrome. It was a terrible
shock, but we never considered termination. A week later I went for an
ultrasound scan and by that time we had accepted that there was a strong
possibility that the baby had some problem. We never imagined for a
moment that he was dead.''
Mary was 18 weeks pregnant, and as her body had not rejected the baby,
she had to have her labour induced. They had been given the news on a
Thursday, and were to return to the hospital on the Saturday for the
induction. It was the longest two days of their lives. Practical
arrangements had to be made for John's care, and the devastating news
broken to family and friends.
Mary even managed to make some of the phone calls to those closest to
her. ''I had to talk about it, to make it real, and having people who
cared for us cry with us helped. The pain and disbelief are
indescribable, and you can't help praying that there's been a mistake,
that the hospital has got it wrong.''
David and Mary needed other people to acknowledge that their son was
important and that his birth and death would not pass unnoticed. On the
Saturday morning, when they arrived at the Queen Mother's Hospital in
Glasgow, their parish priest was waiting for them to offer them comfort.
In the weeks and months that followed, through Mary's next pregnancy and
when baby Emma arrived safely, it was this kind of spontaneous care and
support that helped sustain the family.
They have a photograph of the baby, and his birth and death are
recorded in the Book of Remembrance which is kept in the hospital
chapel. David and Mary privately call him by the name they had already
chosen for him, although he was born too early to be registered and so
have birth and death certificates
''People forget, because he didn't make a big mark on life. I miss my
mother every day, and I still cry for her, but we had a life together
for years before she died. This baby was ours from the moment he was
conceived, but we were the only two who knew him. Some people might
think that having Emma made everything all right, but it doesn't work
that way. We have three children, but our second son died, and we want
him back all the time. We never get away from that longing.''
When you talk to David and Mary their pain and loss is tangible, but
only truly understood by people who have gone through a similar
experience. It would be facile to attempt to quantify such anguish, but
Philip and Elizabeth have suffered the loss of four children. They now
have two healthy sons, and again Philip points out that some people
think this makes up for all they have been through.
Elizabeth's first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage at 14 weeks, and
they worried all through her second pregnancy, until Charlotte was born,
small but apparently healthy. Two days later her heart failed due to a
rare defect, and she spent the next 10 days in intensive care.
Philip talks about it as if it happened yesterday. ''She kept rallying
and then failing but we were sure she'd pull through. Elizabeth was
terribly weak after a long labour but we both just stayed there with her
and we never voiced our fears. We held each other and touched her hands
and said, 'Please God', over and over, but we never believed she could
die. She had dark, dark hair and beautiful eyes and we would stroke her
and tell her about her cousins and where she would go to school and what
our house was like.
''Then the consultant came in and told us very gently that she wasn't
going to live. It was unreal. They unhooked all these tubes and gave her
to us and I held her for a while and then gave her to Elizabeth, because
I think both of us believed that if anyone could save her it would be
her mum.
''Elizabeth rocked her and I had my arms round both of them and I
could hear Elizabeth whispering, 'Live, live, live', and half an hour
later, Charlotte just stopped breathing and Elizabeth didn't believe she
was dead and she wouldn't let the nurse take her . . . ''
It is nearly 10 years since Charlotte died, but the pain has never
lessened. The following year Elizabeth had another miscarriage, and a
year later Henry was stillborn. They still don't know why and Elizabeth
can only describe that time as ''unspeakable''. ''I knew Charlotte. She
was a living, breathing, perfect little girl and I could describe her
character to you now, but I never got that chance with Henry.''
Neither of them can explain where they got the courage to attempt to
have more children, but their gratitude for their healthy sons is
constant. They admit to being ''a little over-indulgent, but we'll never
get away from that. Even when our sons are grown up we'll always worry
about them.''
Like David and Mary, Philip and Elizabeth want their children
remembered, and the hardest times are when that doesn't happen. When
Charlotte was born, a number of friends also had new babies and young
children and worried that seeing them would make life harder for Philip
and Elizabeth.
The practices of the past, where the death of a child was ignored or
only acknowledged for a short time, are changing. Hazel Brooke,
executive director of the Scottish Cot Death Trust, considers this
remembrance to be a real step forward in caring for bereaved parents,
and their families and friends.
Memorial services provide a focus for grief and Hazel relates
experiences which are heart-rending. For one woman, the chance to say
her child's name out loud just once a year in public affords her some
relief. Another couple put flowers on their son's grave on what would
have been his 16th birthday and wryly said: ''Not much of a present for
a 16-year-old boy.''
David and Mary have strong Christian faith which they both turn to
constantly when the pain becomes unbearable. Mary feels that on the
worst days that is all that can help. ''We still have a life with our
children and our families and friends. We will always love him like we
do John and Emma, and I believe he is waiting for us in Heaven. When
everyone else has forgotten him we will still carry him in our hearts.''

YOU have to hand it to the trio, Csardas -- mezzo-soprano Sheila
Osborne, violinist Bernard Docherty, and pianist Stephen Adam. They have
carved themselves a very personal niche in the music scene, and, over a
decade, have cultivated a dedicated following.
There might not be -- you would think -- a lot of mileage in playing
arrangements of music deriving from an instantly identifiable gipsy
origin or idiom. Don't you believe it; these three have made it their
own art form. I don't know who their audience is, but it is a big one.
The group undertakes around 35 gigs per year including tours of Wales
and England and, reckoned violinist Docherty last night, they must have
played around 75% of UK music clubs.
They are extremely well-known in their native Glasgow, of course,
especially from short concerts in the Burrell and Merchants' Hall. (In
another life, Osborne is an arts administrator, Docherty co-leader of
the BBC SSO, and Adams a cellist in the Scottish Opera orchestra.) Yet
last night, oddly enough, was the first full-scale concert Csardas has
given on its own turf.
They did the lot, from Bartok's Rumanian Dances and Gypsy Songs by
Dvorak, to cleverly arranged scenes from Carmen and numerous operettas.
Every gipsy tune you've ever heard (and couldn't put a name to) was
included. At what they do, the group is polished, catching the essential
emotional ingredients which swing between melancholy and extrovert
ebullience.
More than that; they dispatch the lot with terrific panache. Stephen
Adams's arrangements (and his own extraordinary piano playing) catch
every nuance of colour and rhythmic excitement that typifies this music.
You can't knock success.

Education Correspondent Barclay McBain explains how Scotland is
showing the way in the information technology revolution.
WHEN is the plural of man not men? When a growing number of academics
and students talk about Mans in universities and colleges, of all
places.
So much for standards, you might think. But it is legitimate to use
the term Mans on campus. And since it has an educational application it
is inevitably an acronym, for metropolitan area networks. These networks
will put Scotland at the forefront of the information technology
revolution.
The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council has already invested
more than #2m in setting up networks which link higher education
institutions by computer in four centres: Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen,
and Fife and Tayside, the latter -- acronym Fatman -- including Stirling
University.
''It means that every university in Scotland is connected up to what
the media calls the superhighway. It gives Scotland quite a unique
position worldwide,'' explained Rod Matthews, chief executive of
ScottishTelecom, the ScottishPower company which won the contracts to
install the networks.
Last month the funding council announced that it was putting a further
#5m into several initiatives which include building a wider area network
linking all 21 universities and colleges in Scotland by computer.
Although the Wan contract has not been awarded yet, ScottishTelecom
will surely be well placed to win it given its track record in
telecommunications, the trade routes of the future.
The company, which was launched last year, has built an advanced
fibre-optic communications network which operates across Scotland and
beyond.
It is this network which Scottish higher education has tapped into in
a development which will revolutionise the ways information is
exchanged, students are taught, and researchers work.
''This is not science fiction. It is actually happening. In Scotland
we are way ahead of the rest of the UK, and among the most advanced in
Europe. That is not an idle claim,'' said Professor John Arbuthnott,
principal of Strathclyde University in Glasgow, and chairman of the
committee responsible for managing computer networks and support
services across British higher education.
What sets the Scottish network apart is not simply the amount of
material which can be transmitted. Something of its potential can be
gleaned from the other projects which the funding council is supporting:
establishing video conferencing in universities and colleges; developing
a multi-media music network for performing, composing, research, and
interactive distance learning initiatives; and building computer links
between medical schools and teaching hospitals.
David Rundell, who manages computer services at Heriot-Watt University
in Edinburgh, described it as the best network in Europe, in terms of
capacity and speed of application.
''If you're transferring data it doesn't matter if it's coming two or
three seconds later, but if you're sending a picture or sound in real
time and there's too much information on your network the sound breaks
up and the picture distorts. This network can guarantee transfers right
across big distances,'' he said.
Or, to put it another way: ''This represents such a dramatic change.
It's like moving from a country lane to the M25, but without any traffic
on it,'' said Rod Matthews. The Edinburgh Man, he pointed out, was
capable of delivering 100 times more than it curently did. ''In terms of
telecommunications traffic opportunities in Edinburgh, it's like getting
rid of a jam on the M6 because suddenly you have 100 lanes.''
Although the applications for teaching students are at an early stage,
discussions are under way about producing material which could be taught
at a number of institutions. Napier University, which has several sites
in Edinburgh, has plans to introduce video conferencing facilities
across the campus to enable students to take a module and join in actual
tutorials without having to travel across the city and be there in
person.
And the day may not be too far off when students will be able to get
access to the network from cable TV at home. One spin-off of the network
involves ScottishTelecom linking up with Scottish Television in a
project -- again using fibre optics -- aimed at providing institutions
with television monitors broadcasting academic and social programmes.
Talks have taken place with three universities about possible
applications, including broadcasting lectures and giving the service
over to students from dusk to dawn for their own DIY programmes.
Institutions are also looking at ways to encourage students to own a
personal computer. The Open University already has a scheme which
enables its students to rent PCs for the duration of their studies.
Obviously there are serious implications for students' personal and
social development of what its critics might call hi-tech, high-quality
correspondence-course learning. You don't pick up many of the
transferable skills which employers place great emphasis on by sitting
at a computer all day, they argue.
But, as the funding council remarked, the creative use of IT has a key
role in maintaining quality and effectiveness when public money for the
sector is being cut.
That creativity is already in play: biologists and chemists exchanging
3-D models of cells on the network for drug research; medical students
watching highly-specialised operations or the diagnosis of a rare
illness; researchers using electronic libraries to study pieces of art
in the Louvre or ancient manuscripts in the Vatican.
When it comes to trading information on the Mans, the Wan, or the
worldwide web, Scottish higher education has the route well and truly
planned.

THE computer era reached the National Gallery in London four years ago
and opened the way to a revolution in education and the study of art.
The company that set up the London Micro-Gallery has now worked its
magic in the National Gallery in Washington, in a new and improved
version of the system.
In art matters, it's the most important innovation since colour
printing spawned the modern art book and exhibition catalogue. But it
has a far wider significance: this is interactive television. This is
what schools and libraries will be like in 10 years, and home libraries
soon after that. It's quite astonishing.
All the 1700 works in the gallery's permanent collection have been
photographed for the Micro-Gallery, together with an encyclopaedic array
of information on each of them and 650 artists, on more than 500 topics
of art history and appreciation.
There is a comprehensive dictionary of art terminology, an atlas of 12
maps, and a historical timeline for cultural, social and political
events since 1100. There is even an audio system to teach visitors how
to pronounce the more obscure Latin terms.
It fits into a computer that could sit on your desk. It's a
top-of-the-line machine, of course, with a 20-inch monitor , so it would
cost $5000 or so -- but no doubt the price will drop. The first
astonishment, though, is its capacity. It offers 5300 screens of
information: it would take 11 days to scroll through them all.
But that's to amaze and please computer freaks. Far more marvellous is
the ease of using it. It's touch and show, like the one in London. Touch
the icon labelled ''artists'' and an alphabetical list appears. Touch a
name, Raphael, for example, and instantly there is an array of small
images of each of the Raphaels in the collection.
Touch one of them, and the full picture instantly fills the screen. In
10 seconds, you can have any picture in the gallery in front of you, and
then summon up commentary, cross references and background at equal
speed.
The Washington system has one spectacular improvement on London's.
After finding a particular picture, the viewer can zoom in to an area of
a couple of square inches, and blow it out to fill the screen. Those
medieval or Renaissance pictures, with exquisite and meticulous features
can now be studied in every detail.
When officials from Washington went to inspect the London system, they
shared the general fear that visitors would amuse themselves playing
with the computer, and then skip the pictures themselves. They found
that nothing of the sort happened.
With the Washington system, they can call up a print-out telling them
how to find each picture they have chosen, printed on a map. Each of
their selections is reproduced, postage-stamp size, to remind them of
what they are looking for. Furthermore, a quarter or a third of the
visitors to the London Micro-Gallery go to it after they have looked at
pictures, wanting more information than wall-labels can provide.
Both the London and Washington systems were devised by Cognitive
Applications Ltd of Brighton. They were both paid for by American
Express, and here's another surprise: the cost of the whole system in
Washington was only $1.5m. There is no reason why Scottish museums, for
instance, should not follow the London and Washington examples.
The only places that might hesitate are the mega-museums, like the
British Museum, the Louvre or the Met in New York, with millions of
objects.
London is preparing to update its system with better colour and
detail, and the zoom feature of the Washington gallery. That will take
two years or so, and no doubt there will be further improvement.
It is also expected that this interactive technology will soon arrive
in schools to teach many subjects beyond art. For the moment, it can't
go on-line, meaning you can't dial into a distant computer and call up
the image and manipulate it. Transmitting the data over the wires takes
too long. But that, too will change, and very soon. Revolutions move
fast, and this one is still accelerating.

The Government talks about stepping up the war against drug smuggling
but Cameron Simpson reports that we seem to be lowering our defences.
IN THE drugs war appearances can be deceptive. It is a fact the
Customs and Excise officers in the frontline know from bitter
experience.
Under attack from the away-day drug smuggler who leaves dangerous
souvenirs on our beaches, officers are now having to fight the enemy
within -- their own management and a Government prepared for almost any
sacrifice on the altar of cost cutting.
Yet on the face of it, the Government generals are four-square behind
the troops charged with protecting our coastline. Chancellor Kenneth
Clarke last year pledged to give them ''all possible support'' while the
Queen in her speech said: ''My Government will play an active part in
tackling drug trafficking.''
But to the National Union of Civil and Public Servants they are
nothing but ''weasel words''. The reality is totally different. Drastic
cutbacks planned by the Government envisage making 550 anti-smuggling
staff redundant, with the most severe cutbacks in the more remote parts
of the country.
Seven C&amp;E offices in Scotland are due to be closed with a further six
earmarked for the same fate. Over the next four years Scotland's force
of 1650 is due to fall by between 300 and 350. For the UK as a whole,
the cuts will see 25,000 officers reduced to 20,500.
The fuse which has brought the debate exploding to life is the Krakow
II. The map above would have you believe that 20 tonnes of cannabis were
found on board the Polish vessel earlier this year in Invergordon.
Not so. Hard-pressed C&amp;E men failed to uncover the cache because they
were short of manpower. As they were preparing to search the
13,000-tonne vessel some were called away to deal with another
suspicious ship at Ullapool. As a result, neither search was as
comprehensive as normal, and nothing was uncovered.
The Krakow II had escaped Scot free, or so she thought. Still
harbouring suspicions, officers tipped off their counterparts in Norway
who went on board to uncover 20 tonnes of cannabis -- described as one
of the biggest seizures in Europe this year.
However, The Herald was alerted to the true amount by a Customs
intelligence report passed anonymously to the paper. In reality, there
were 50 tonnes on board worth #200m.
When pressed on the matter, a C&amp;E spokesman said he thought the figure
was 20 tonnes and described the operation as a joint success for Britain
and Norway.
If it had been such a rip-roaring success why then did they not
trumpet the fact that they had captured 50 and not 20 tonnes from the
rooftops?
It is a question that Bill Johnston, NUCPS branch secretary, believes
he can answer. ''Might it be that they're embarrassed over the whole
episode?''
His union fears that with the imminent cuts such cases will become
commonplace. C&amp;E management sees it in a different light. ''We are
working towards a new strategy,'' a spokesman said. Against the
background of staff cuts and office closures this strategy will put a
greater reliance on more sophisticated intelligence gathering, modern
transportation methods and fast-action response teams based at Paisley.
He said: ''We are going to rely on intelligence gathering rather than
people walking the beach. It is a luxury we can't afford.''
Paisley will increasingly become the intelligence hub for Scotland.
''This side might be marginally increased.''
He maintained that most of the drugs came into Britain through the
Channel ports from the Far East and Spain. ''There is no significant
evidence that there are large quantities of drugs coming into Scotland
via its coasts.
''The Labour Party says it will increase the number of customs
officers but that will not necessarily mean a reduction in drugs. A
visible presence can be a deterrent but when it comes to drugs it is a
case of getting inside information and intelligence.
''We have a programme of shrinkages in our department but with better
information we think we can be as effective with our new methods. It's a
question of being flexible, mobile and resourceful.''
It is a strategy that leaves Bill Johnston cold. And here again
appearance diverges from reality. A big bluff man, Johnston, aged 44,
does not look like your archetypal C&amp;E officer, with his bushy
moustache, ponytail and a liking for rolling his own cigarettes. But
there it ends. As he talks there is no doubting his dedication to the
fight against drugs.
He said: ''The people of Scotland are entitled to ask in the light of
recent announcements of cutbacks whether C&amp;E is doing enough to protect
Scotland. Our answer as a union is clearly no.
''When you look at the map it puts into perspective our department's
view that resources should be concentrated on the south coast of
England.
''Clearly if the drug baron sees that his consignments are being
intercepted there then he will switch his attention to where he sees the
best opportunity to get his evil merchandise into the UK.
''Looking at the map, it would appear as though this is exactly what
is happening. Commercial quantities of drugs on a scale previously
unimaginable are clearly being channelled towards a poorly defended
Scottish coastline.''
Mr Johnston said you only had to look at the size of the jobs at
Ullapool (value #100m) and Invergordon (#200m) to bear this out. ''More
cocaine at Ullapool than was seized at Heathrow and Gatwick airports
that whole year, and the Invergordon job which was missed was 80% of the
UK total for the year. All of this is clearly indicative of a strategy
which is not working.
''This Government should be abiding by its various statements made in
1994. John Major, at the Corfu drugs summit, said we must protect our
young people from this unscrupulous trade and we needed a clear action
plan, while Kenneth Clarke, in the Commons, said that C&amp;E were working
hard to ensure that drug-related criminal activity does not rise to a
level which constitutes a threat to national security and that he would
give them all possible support in this work.
''The Government's 'support' and 'action plan' were announced in
November 1994. A cut of 550 frontline anti-smuggling officers -- that's
some support.''
He said the Government had tried to address the problem by a programme
of education for our young people but there seemed to be something of a
contradiction here since resources were being taken away from the very
thing we did not want our children to become involved with.
He added: ''Further salt has been rubbed into the wounds of the
anti-smuggling staff. They have been told that if, after the first round
of cuts, they have maintained the level of achievement that the C&amp;E
management wants then far from being rewarded they will face more cuts.
Fine compensation.
''The question I asked was 'Is Scotland being protected properly?'
Make up your own mind.''

John Cooney talks to Glasgow-born Pat Doherty, who could become Sinn
Fein's candidate in an Irish parliamentary by-election.
PAT DOHERTY, the Glasgow-born vice-president of Sinn Fein, is tipped
to become his party's choice to win a parliamentary seat in the Irish
Republic.
A member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, set up by the
Irish Government after the IRA ceasefire, Doherty is the favourite to
run as the Sinn Fein candidate in a by-election following the death this
week of the veteran independent republican, Neil Blaney.
Blaney, who was sacked from the Irish Cabinet in 1970 by Premier Jack
Lynch, for alleged gun-running to Northern Ireland, was the deputy for
Donegal North for 47 years.
Blaney was an Irish nationalist hero of Doherty, who disowns his
Scottish identity despite being born and reared in the Gorbals. ''My
feelings would never have been Scottish, even though I was born in
Glasgow,'' he says. ''I always felt Irish. My parents were immigrants
from Donegal and I grew up in an Irish community.''
So strong was the sense of Irishness that just before St Patrick's Day
in 1968 Pat Doherty, along with his young wife, Mary, sold their flat in
Glasgow and moved to Donegal.
Like most Irish Catholic immigrants from Scotland, Doherty was brought
up to revere the Catholic Church, the Labour Party and Celtic. He
studied in Liverpool for the priesthood with the Mill Hill Missionary
Order, but although he enjoyed college life, with its mixture of sport,
sanctity and strictness, he decided at 17 that the priesthood was not
for him.
On his return to Glasgow he went to work in an architect's office and
learned technical drawing. Having no money -- all his friends and
relations were in the construction industry and were earning good money
-- he became for a time an unlikely navvy. When he moved to Ireland, his
socialist instincts were sharpened.
The start of the civil rights agitation in Derry against the
corruption of the Unionist-dominated Stormont stirred both his ''social
conscience and pointed out the whole reality of what was happening on
the national question''.
''I saw the arrival of the British troops and I could see what was
happening on the streets. I saw the whole nonsense of partition.''
Angered by the poor economic and social conditions in which people
were living -- as well as the rough treatment from an ''army of
occupation'' -- he joined Sinn Fein in April 1970. ''I had no
relationship with the IRA. I joined Sinn Fein.''
But asked about his attitude to the IRA: ''My attitude was that the
IRA had an absolute right to resist the British Army.''
In 1988 he became vice-president and was close to the talks between
Adams and John Hume, the leader of Northern Ireland's Social Democratic
and Labour Party.
Fourteen months after the announcement of the IRA ceasefire a
disappointed Doherty says: ''The enthusiasm of August 1994 has been
almost destroyed by the attitude of the British Government. They have
created an enormous steel door to eventual peace in Ireland. They have
the key to open it. We have to persuade them to use that key.''
One of the side-benefits of the IRA ceasefire is that Doherty this
summer made his first visit in 21 years to his native Glasgow. He was
amazed at how beautiful Glasgow city centre is. ''My memory was of the
dirty tenements. The Gorbals that I grew up in is gone. It was like
being in the middle of Paris,'' he enthused. ''I was absolutely
awestruck.''
His attention was also caught by the similarity of the debate about
Scottish nationalism with the case Sinn Fein makes for national
self-determination in Ireland. His advice to the SNP leadership is
''forget your little internal rows and keep your eye on the core value
-- Scotland's right to self-determination''.
Doherty also wants the Ulster Unionists to accept this principle,
whose core value, he insists, is totally democratic. ''We accept that
there must be consent -- the Unionists must express their fears and
concerns.''
With the IRA ceasefire now in question, Doherty could find himself in
the throes of testing public opinion in the Republic if he seeks a
mandate to the Irish Parliament as Blaney's successor.

Bitter pills: Irene Adams vows to fight on against drug pushers
despite warnings to 'quit meddling'.
WHEN Irene Adams talks about her impulsive stand against narcotics
overlords and their sodality of bullies it is as if the pages of a novel
are being turned. Just for a moment you may imagine you are sitting not
in Paisley but close to the tortured heart of Sicily, listening to a
courageous widow nail her anger on the Mafia.
In Italy, of course, Adams would be elevated to living sainthood by
now, a distinction that would place her in even greater danger from
those long-practised in unseen vengeance with precision.
She tilts her head in laughter at the comparison but there are enough
references there for her to say that what is urgently needed in this
country is a sophisticated Witness Protection scheme. By this she means
that significant police informers should feel confident that they can be
spirited away from the very real threat of vendettas to live in secure
houses where their new identities will never be breached.
This would depend on flexible, confidential liaison between police
forces and housing authorities throughout the country, but in purging
its drugs menace America is now proving such a service is possible. And
here Northern Ireland's troubles also provided the Army and the RUC with
effective experience in facilitating secret escape to elsewhere for
those brave enough to spy on the netherworld of terrorism.
But has intimidation from drug peddlers reached such a fearsome pitch
in Britain that informants require this kind of cast-iron vanishing
service? Adams, whose Paisley North constituency contains the original
temazepam township of Ferguslie Park, has no doubt that fear of reprisal
can carry as damaging consequences for society as the raw needlework of
drug-abuse itself.
She believes Clare Short's recent off-the-cuff misfortune in mooting
debate on the legalisation of certain drugs was blown up out of all
proportion. Adams herself would support the need for frank and serious
discussion if only to alert the rest of us to the enormity of the
problem. From her vantage point the outlook is terrifying, but most
people, she says, simply close their eyes to the horror which is both
funding and destroying so many corners of our culture.
''People saw this campaign was in earnest when we set out to get
temazepam capsules banned. Now we have achieved this, and quite a lot of
folk are coming forward with information, but out there there are still
great numbers of desperately scared individuals who feel at too great a
risk to help.''
Better than most Irene Adams understands the perils because they are
also stacked against her door. Anonymity's curse arrives by telephone,
or by the crudest letter, but threats have also reached her children and
in-laws, the over-aggressive shove in crowded places being followed by
muffled warnings that Adams should quit her ''meddling for everybody's
sake''.
Her anti-drugs crusade grew from no planned strategy but was a
spontaneous response to the engulfing worries of her constituents.
''This is maybe foolhardy but I never worried about the consequences for
me, although the threats do scare me for my family. However, it would
have been very wrong not to have acted on other people's behalf.''
Her house and movements are now carefully monitored by the police and
she and her three children keep in constant touch through contact
telephone numbers. But long before this the Adams' household learned to
be secure beyond the norm when Allen, her late husband and politician
was one of the Labour Whips for Northern Ireland.
''Every day we had to be vigilant about anything suspicious. That also
meant I had to drive the kids to school each time by a varied route. So,
in a way, none of this now is unexpected or unfamiliar, and I must say
the police are excellently supportive.''
Appalled at the rising number of amputations and deaths caused by
injecting jellies (the now prohibited temazepam capsules), Adams
launched her campaign early this year. A spate of shootings, death
threats and gang wrangles intensified her commitment last spring.
There were also her allegations that FCB Enterprise Security Ltd, a
community business funded by Renfrew District Council, Strathclyde
Regional Council and the Scottish Office, and run by Labour Party
members, was being used as a front for money-laundering. Vocal attack
and counter-attack have marked the rhythm of events since then.
Meanwhile, Strathclyde Police, the Scottish Office and Renfrew District
Council each have the matter under investigation.
At the same time, but for separate reasons, local Labour Party
activity has been effectively suspended in the constituencies of Renfrew
West and Inverclyde, Paisley North and Paisley South following
accusations of manipulation. The findings of the national party's own
internal inquiry are expected in a matter of weeks.
Did all this fire and spittle, the seething denunciations, prime Adams
for the minor stroke which befell her during the first night of her New
York holiday last August? Now fully recovered, she reflects that stress
was undoubtedly a factor, but the whole experience was made more
traumatic because it occurred precisely five years to the day that her
husband collapsed with a brain haemorrhage during a family holiday in
Spain. Allen Adams died three weeks later.
But that night last summer, in her bedroom at the Helmsley Hotel on
East 58th, she first thought she was suffering from the New York
heatwave, like everybody else. The temperature was over 100 degrees, she
was in jet-lag and, with her daughter, she had been shopping and
strolling by Central Park.
At 4am the symptoms of what doctors called a transitory ischaemic
attack began with the loss of power in her left hand. ''My daughter
Barbara was staying in the same room, and I woke her up and said: 'I
don't want to alarm you but I think I might be having a small stroke'.
Well, naturally she leapt out of bed. But for some reason I was
perfectly calm. I remember saying: 'If it is a stroke then it's a real
pain in the neck because it probably means the end of the holiday'.''
Later in the Roosevelt Hospital her condition worsened, then
stabilised. But her recurring thought was how the children would cope
''if this thing turns out to be as bad as it might''. Had she left them
well prepared? ''That past family tragedy had taught me that every one
of us is more vulnerable than we believe, but I just felt the family
were too young -- Barbara, 23, Kirsty, 21, and Allen, just 17 -- to go
through all that pain so soon again.''
Speedy, comprehensive insurance took care of the bills which totalled
around $10,000, but Adams has nothing but praise for the New York
treatment, the expertise immediately on hand, the hotel's efficiency and
concern, and the cab driver's swift, attentive manoeuvres in racing her
to the Roosevelt.
Now the only obvious difference in her appearance is the absence of
cigarettes, but Adams is determined also to resume her old regime of
taking one hour out from Commons'time each day, to walk in as much fresh
air as is possible around the Palaces of Westminster.
''When I was recovering and reflecting on things I suddenly realised
that I had left that routine slip for more than a year simply because of
the volume of work. The daft hours we put in -- often from 9am to 11pm
-- make politicians clear candidates for this sort of crisis.''
Although she downplays the hassles, Adams needs resourceful and
phlegmatic nature to be in good fettle because now there is another
problem round the corner. She prefers to see it as a niggling irritation
but over the past few months there have been persistent rumours that her
candidacy for the next General Election may well be challenged. Ruefully
she says it has been quite a year.
''What the boundary changes have meant in the Renfrewshire area is
that Linwood has come out of Renfrew West and Inverclyde and into
Paisley North, but it only makes up 15% of my constituency. The rest
remains my original seat. So that stuff about a challenge is really only
speculation.
''Under party rules, unless 30% of your seat moves to another
constituency, you have no automatic right to challenge. In other words,
it's just not on to move in because you think the new arrangement is a
better seat.''
Allegations of smear tactics to oust certain party members, and
tip-offs about suspected orchestrated moves to place key Labour
activists in powerful positions at Ferguslie . . . this is also the kind
of fuming chatter which seems to boil up around Paisley North, alleged
intimidation exacerbating argument.
''All I can say is that I've had great support from party officials
and right from the top,'' says Adams. ''If I was facing a real political
challenge then I would take the situation much more seriously. But since
that day I was selected, just over five years ago, the constituency has
never called me to account, and last May it issued a statement saying it
was 100% behind me in the drugs war.''
What does concern her, though, is the bad light cast on the local
party by so much ugly truculence. Adams insists the trouble is being
stirred by only a few individuals who ''for one reason or another have
sought to further their own agendas''.
If the candidacy were snatched from her in a political contest then,
she maintains, she would come to terms with that because: ''That's the
game we're in''. But she adds that she has never operated in order to
build up a personal power bloc. ''I believe that is very, very wrong.
I'm not Irene Adams MP because I'm Irene Adams, but because I'm the
Labour candidate, and I'll never forget that.''
She inherited her husband's seat after his death, at first reluctant
to stand but then persuaded by general approval and the fact that she
had been a member of the Labour Party since the age of 16.
''I had a very good marriage, which I suppose is unusual today, but I
never expected it to end as quickly as that. When I stood for Parliament
I know now that I was still in shock, running on adrenalin, running as
hard as I could to get away from the grief.
''When bereavement happens it is like being hit by a sledgehammer
every morning, but it is true that the terrible pain lessens. You never
get over the trauma but there comes a point when the flashes of memory
change from being sad to being happy.'' Her husband, Adams believes,
would be pleased by the doggedness of her fight.
It is not the squalid street-pusher of drugs whom she is after but
those figures of respectability who, with great stealth, head national
chains of command and are adept at ensuring the casual bystander notices
nothing. Adams is convinced that the bulk of jellies reached communities
not through prescription scams, although they were certainly part of it,
but because of a breakdown in the pharmaceutical network.
Anyone, she says,  can register as a pharmaceutical wholesaler. That
done, you then go along to the Department of Trade and Industry, and
request a licence, saying that you have an export order for 5,00,000
temazepam capsules. Equipped with this you move to a manufacturer where
you buy that 5,000,000 at, say, 3p per capsule. Only you never do export
them.  ''In fact, we know that on paper Britain exports more temazepam
than it manufactures.''
From now on, licences will be much more heavily policed but Adams
won't rest until all licences are totally monitored.
So, for years what was meant for abroad has been ending up in the
backstreets of home, but not at 3p a time. Instead, the jellies price
would be nearer #4 a capsule. ''To keep that tidy profit in your pocket
you would want to shut up someone like me very quickly.''
But Irene Adams has already proved she can't be easily hushed -- not
by threats, not by illness, not by personal tragedy or cheap onslaughts
on her Commons eligibility. Last time, she may have partly won her seat
on a sympathy vote for the widow, but if she does hold on to it, the
reason now will be conspicuous merit. And then she may come to feel the
healing process is very near complete.

DOUGAL PERMAN looks at the changing image of nightclub security and
finds an industry employing thinkers rather than fighters.
VELMA had Friday night off: ''I had a few beers, a bath and then
straight to bed. All my friends were getting ready to go out but I was
in my jammies!''
So might you be if, like Velma and her five colleagues, you spent your
weekends guarding the entrance to Edinburgh's busy La Belle Angele
venue. Inside DJs Gareth, Zammo and Anthony Papa were mixing uplifting
tracks for a responsive crowd, outside it's cold and there were a lot of
people keen to get into Stripped; Saturday night's thumping house club.
''The only thing between the door of a pub or club,'' says John
McLeod, owner of Option 1 Security, ''and the people outside, is you.''
A sobering thought for most young clubbers. There hasn't been a fight in
La Belle Angele for more than two years but things can get nasty. During
McLeod's worst weekend, he was knifed outside Wilkie House on Friday,
shot at while guarding the Pelican on Saturday, and someone swung a road
sign at his head on Sunday.
Tonight, the team on the door seem to have everything running
smoothly. Wallis and Mick on the gate, Tony and Colin searching the men
and Velma and Sandy searching the women. Option 1 employs 60 to 80
security guards of which only six to eight are women because it is still
regarded as a male job. Regardless of gender, the generic term is
doorman.
Stripped is a members and regulars club. This allows the doormen to
get to know most of the clubbers. Prevention is better than cure: ''I
chat to all the people coming into the club,'' Wallis says, ''we can
knock back the trouble-makers.''
Doormen come from the army, off the dole, or just looking for a bit of
extra work. By day Colin is a PhD student, Velma works in a hotel. But
for others it is a full-time job. To McLeod there's no substitute for
common sense -- spotting the difference between somebody with a hip
flask and someone carrying a knife is crucial. He would rather employ a
thinker than a fighter any day. ''You can send me a Sumo wrestler or a
black belt in karate, but if they aren't capable of doing the job I
won't employ them.''
McLeod is a businessman. He started Option 1 seven years ago, when he
was 19, working some of the roughest doors in Edinburgh. Now he drives a
white Mercedes and still works the doors. He exercises the same care in
choosing his staff as doormen do when assessing potential
trouble-makers. Each week he interviews around 30 applicants but only
four are successful.
He demands professionalism: one guy walked into the hotel boardroom
Option 1 had hired for interviewing applicants in Aberdeen, looked at
the management team at the top of the table and said: ''Eh, what's all
this for a doorman's job?'' That was the end of his interview.
McLeod isn't shy to give advice either. Another man slouched in
wearing a football top and slumped in the chair. ''I told him never to
go back to an interview without a suit and a positive attitude. He won't
come back to me again but I did him a favour. Image is everything.''
Option 1 security guards wear smart black T-shirts and jackets with the
company logo prominently displayed.
Wallis was sporting a unique bright blue T-shirt. ''Helps me stand out
mate. If someone needs me they can find me easier this way.'' Not
everyone would want to find the doorman of a club or pub easily as many
clubbers still regard security as ''bouncers'', 17-stone skinheads in
bow ties who, McLeod hopes, are a dying breed.
''We don't want trouble. If we have a boring night where nothing
happens we're happy,'' laughs Colin, ''same again next week please!''
But doormen do have to deal with trouble. ''If we need to throw somebody
out the club we take them to the door and leave them,'' Wallis says.
''Some doormen would take them outside and kick them in. We're not that
kind of company. If you're nice to the people as they come in, 90% of
the time you get that back.''
And it seems that the people at Stripped tonight are happy to trust
the doormen. One girl came to Velma in tears for a hug and support while
another was keen to get a picture of ''my favourite doormen'' on her way
out. The bouncer stereotype does exist though. ''People think you are
stupid,'' says Colin. ''They see me, a big guy, muscles and short hair
and think I'm thick. One night a student said to me, 'You wouldn't have
a job if it wasn't for me!' I said: 'Actually I'm a post-graduate
student. Good-bye'.''
At 12.30 the club has sold out but there is still a big overflow of
unsatisfied clubbers shouting ''I'm on the guest list''. A group of five
girls who turned up at one o'clock claimed, ''It's a hen night, you've
got to let us in''.
The La Belle Angele doormen say they hate this part of the evening.
People just don't understand ''Go away''.
McLeod worked at La Belle Angele several weeks ago for house club Yip
Yap's second birthday party. He likes to lead by example. McLeod's
partner Magic Sandlan and Bruce McLaren, office manager, both keep their
hand in working as doormen too.
Option 1 are currently working on contracts in Glasgow, increasing
their already large coverage of Scotland from Edinburgh to Aberdeen and
Inverness. McLeod is keen to cover all areas of security but insists:
''I've never taken on a contract that was beyond me. We'll look at
anything and if we can help, we will help.''
Expansion is difficult, though, because they are regarded as
expensive, charging #5 an hour -- of which the security guard gets
around #3.40. McLeod boasts that he pays better than any other firm,
''if you pay peanuts, you get monkeys.''
If ''image is everything'', you might think there is nothing behind
McLeod's white Mercedes, mobile phone and smart suits. He insists this
is not the case. ''You've got to make the effort. I can turn up in a
different suit every day but if I've got nothing to show for it, I won't
get the business.''
Wallis is trained in first aid, as are most of the doormen on tonight
but the majority of their training is done on the job. Option 1 sends
new employees to the Sheriff Court on Monday morning to get an idea of
who not to let in on Saturday night.
Wallis and his team are also aware of the people they are dealing
with. Club culture is drug culture. ''Ninety per cent of the people here
are on something,'' he tells me, so they have to be able to deal with
illness or overdoses. On top of all this they keep smiling.
''I love being a doorman!'' beams Velma, ''it can be a drag but you
meet so many people.'' When they move into the club, once the doors are
closed, Sandy enjoys standing next to the speakers so she can get into
the music, Velma wishes she was off duty and Tony enjoys a dance with
his friends but they are alert to what's going on all the time. You can
have the best music, top DJs and a great venue but if the people inside
feel insecure it all goes to nothing.
While talking to me each doorman had one eye on the dance floor.

Glasgow's Theatre Royal is looking good as it celebrates its
centenary, but the fates have not always been kind, finds Keith Bruce
WHAT with one thing and another, it has not been much of a
celebration. In fact it was limited to a single introductory line in the
announcement of the autumn and winter season, and a page of history in
the accompanying brochure. Nonetheless 1995 has seen the centenary of
Glasgow's Theatre Royal -- ''the justification of the top part of Hope
Street'' as this newspaper's Colm Brogan put it, reporting on its
reopening as an opera house a mere 20 years ago last month.
The owners of the theatre, undoubtedly the most handsom in the city,
have had other things to worry about. Scottish Opera is in the throws of
another of its all-too-regular financial crises, with the future of its
orchestra, its home, and its status as a full-time national company
under threat. On the eve of its showcase at the Edinburgh Festival (now
that that city has finally equipped itself with a lyric theatre to match
the Theatre Royal), its chorus was threatening strike action. Now the
Scottish Office is brokering for a merger with Scottish Ballet. The
small matter of a birthday party was, perhaps understandably,
overlooked.
Which is a minor tragedy, because the Theatre Royal has a story to
tell. It is one that encompasses the history of popular entertainment in
the twentieth century, and although its restored grandeur may be fading
a little, it is still an impressive auditorium with a superb acoustic
(particularly in the gods for some reason) and front-of-house areas that
those who run theatres of similar vintage in the city have reason to
envy.
The centenary is actually that of the present auditorium, which was
rebuilt in 1895 and reopened in September of that year following one of
the periodic fires that have dogged the theatre's existence. When the
first theatre was built on the site, in 1869, it was the third Theatre
Royal to have been built in Glasgow. The first, in Queen Street was
destoyed by fire in 1829, and the second, in Dunlop Street, was
demolished to make way for the rail lines into St Enoch's Station.
Theatrical entrepreneur Edmund Glover was the man behind the early
history of Glasgow theatres bearing the royal imprimateur (although in
fact none of the Theatre Royals in Britain had any such thing until
Queen Victoria decided to legitimise them all in one grand gesture), and
it was he who initially employed celebrated theatre architect Charles
John Phipps to rebuild the Hope Street building after it had, once
again, been destroyed by fire in 1879.
By 1895 the Theatre Royal was owned by Howard and Wyndham -- their
first acquisition in the city in a portfolio that would also include the
King's and the Alhambra which stood near Central Station. It is the
theatre they had Phipps build in six months in 1895 that still stands.
''Victorian gerry-built rubbish,'' a contemporary architect has called
it, and there seems little doubt that much of the original work was
slipshod and much too hasty, but nonetheless the auditorium itself is
held up as example of one of Phipps's finest designs.
The association with opera goes back beyond his building to the
opening year on the site, when the Grand English Opera Company staged
Trovatore. The first complete performance of Wagner's Ring cycle in
Glasgow happened at the Theatre Royal in 1911, and the Carl Rosa company
made the Theatre Royal its Glasgow home in the early part of the
century, inspiring the 12-year old Alexander Gibson to a career in music
and the eventual founding of Scottish Opera.
The theatre also has a strong claim to being the home of Scottish
pantomime with Harry Lauder, Will Fyffe, Tommy Lorne, and Dave Willis
among those who trod the boards. So have Sarah Bernhardt, Henry Irving,
Ellen Terry and Donald Wolfit.
For all that history, the Theatre Royal would probably have gone the
way of the Alhambra and the Empire and made way for office developments
had it not been -- ironically enough -- for the advent of independent
television.
When Scottish Television was established in the mid 1950s it
considered two buildings as its home -- Haymarket ice rink and the
Theatre Royal. What swung it was that Howard and Wyndham, who still
owned the theatre but were then more interested in keeping the Alhambra
going, were among the original investors in STV.
Scottish removed the stalls and built out the stage to become Studio
A, where the Scottish variety tradition was kept alive in the daily live
broadcast of The One O'Clock Gang. The audience queued down Hope Street
for tickets for the television show though they had not been falling
over themselves for theatre tickets.
Other programmes, like John Grierson's networked documentary series
This Wonderful World were made in the smaller Studio C, converted from
an ice store at the back of the theatre.
By the end of the 1960s it was almost 75 years since the Theatre Royal
had had a fire, so it was inevitable that one was due. At 4pm on
November 2, 1969, the fire brigade were dealing with a small fire in the
sub-basement. An hour later the theatre was evacuated and foam was
pumped into the building.
Scottish Television chairman William Brown was then managing director
of Scottish, and he watched the fire fighters tackle the blaze from the
doorway of McConnell's pub across the road. Granada's programmes were
piped into Scottish homes on Channel 10, with Scottish items added into
the news bulletins.
By the early hours of the morning the fire brigade feared that the
building would blow. A fireman had been killed when he fell through a
trapdoor into the basement and drowned. In fact the foam eventually
contained the blaze.
The dead fireman, however, has passed into Theatre Royal folklore.
Orchestra members often claim to have sensed his presence in the pit.
The other spirit, Nora, is Victorian, a cleaner who threw herself from
the balcony when her acting dreams were thwarted.
Today's team of four cleaners and one housekeeper take a great pride
in ''the hall'', says duty manger Linda Brown, who has been at the
Theatre Royal since 1976, because it was so beautifully restored when
Scottish Opera acquired it.
In fact, although Scottish Opera bought the building from STV for the
site price of #300,000, the restoration went wildly over the #3m budget,
eating up the #1m endowment fund that was intended to underwrite the
shows at the new venue.
William Brown, whose company appropriately televised the gala opening
night in October 1975, believes that that overspend lies at the root of
the company's continuing financial difficulties.
Be that as it may, the opening night of Die Fledermaus in ''Scotland's
first opera house'' was a glittering event that occasioned much civic
glee because Edinburgh was still dithering over its ''hole in the
ground'', the site in Castle Terrace earmarked for its opera house.
For doyen of Glasgow journalists Jack House it was ''one of the
greatest events in Scotland in this century''.
He continued: ''Since you can now get from Edinburgh to Glasgow in 43
minutes, why shouldn't Festival opera be presented in the Theatre Royal
in Hope Street. Some chauvinistic Edinburghers might not like the idea,
but it makes sense to me.''
At that opening the Herald's Colm Brogan reported that ''The Lord
Provost of Edinburgh looked a bit amazed -- the Lord Provost of Glasgow
elated.'' In search of a telephone, he wandered into a local pub,
ordering a half and a half. ''Thank Goad,'' he claimed the barman
replied. ''Ye're the first bugger the night who husnae asked fir a
campari an' sody.''
Other remarks at that time are as revealing about the current plight
of Scottish Opera and the theatre, the disposal of which has been
suggested as a possible solution to the company's difficulties.
Original admistrator Peter Hemmings saw the Theatre Royal as a fixture
on the touring circuit for Sadlers Wells, Glyndebourne Touring Opera,
the Royal Shakespeare Company, and the National Theatre, companies which
had then not visited the city for many years. At best that vision has
been realised only sporadically, at worst it has been thwarted by the
agreement that allows Scottish Opera to veto the appearance of rival
companies on its patch. While the opera company wrings its hands about
the possibility of going part time, the theatre itself has usually gone
dark for part of the year.
Linda Brown, who is an example of it herself, says there is an amazing
loyalty to the theatre among both audiences and staff who have been
involved with it since it reopened. Many of the people who came to work
there part-time in the 70s and 80s have gone on to full-time careers in
the theatre.
But it is the audience loyalty which she believes will ensure the
future of the theatre as the home of Scottish Opera, as well as the
belief that a Victorian theatre, even one as splendid as Phipps's
100-year-old creation, is still of as much interest to the property
market as it was when STV bought it 40 years ago. ''It is only worth #5m
if someone is prepared to buy it,'' she notes.
Better that something less -- but possibly not that much less -- than
that was spent making the dowager venue at the dull top end of Hope
Street as grand as she was 20 or even a hundred years ago. It would be a
double tragedy if a birthday present of the old girl was denied because
of the row over the use of Lottery money in London.

Carol Howland samples the taste of Bruges, a Belgian city that has
been caught in a medieval time warp
THE chocolate-box prettiness of Bruges comes as a surprise, like a
city gift-wrapped for the tourist. With its romantic canal, window-boxes
bursting with red geraniums and garlands of blossoms draping its canal
boat landings, this small medieval city only escapes being twee by being
authentic.
The population of inner Bruges, that is, within the circular canal
that follows the line of the old city walls, has remained almost static
at 22,000 since the thirteenth century.
The mellowed-brick, step-gabled buildings rise no more than five
storeys, the roofscape pierced by the spires of some 47 churches. The
clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages over cobbles still fills the air. In
outward appearance, it would seem that little has been allowed to change
since medieval times, only the clothes of the inhabitants and the curly
iron lamps that have been attached to the shop fronts.
Bruges is such an intimate city, utterly walkable. Mercifully, traffic
is restricted to very few cars. Bicycles and horse carriages rule.
Strolling the narrow streets, the views change every few paces like an
architectural kaleidescope, here a chapel supported by flying
buttresses, there a carillon tower with 366 steps to climb. Tiny green
squares and courtyards appear unexpectedly.
In one square is a fish market, in another, a flea market. Shops
specialise in lace and tapestry, pastries and pottery, chocolates and
dolls. Neon signs and chain store fascias are not permitted.
Turn a corner and you might happen upon a pair of cupids under a Doric
temple, or the jaunty carved figure of a chap smoking his pipe above a
restaurant doorway, or a modern sculpture of Leda and the Swan in a
carriage, driven by Prometheus and drawn by Pegasus.
Bruges holds quite a few distinctions. The Church of Our Lady, built
between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries, proudly displays the only
statue by Michaelangelo known to be outside of Italy, a Madonna and
Child, carved when he was only 18.
The first stock exchange in the world is said to have been established
here in the sixteenth century.
The Hospital of St John dates from the middle ages and is thought to
be the oldest in Europe. As well as containing a fine collection of
paintings by Hans Memling, St John's also holds a museum dedicated to
its own history, including a medieval apothecary.
Bruges has a wealth of specialist museums, dedicated to antiques, lace
and carriages. The Gruuthuse Museum offers the chance to wander through
a medieval Flemish nobleman's house. Best of all, the Groeninge Museum
contains a fine collection of paintings by Flemish masters, both
anonymous and well-known.
Just inside is Jean van Eyck's Christ painted in 1440. Hans Memling is
well represented and Hieronymous Bosch's rather horrifying Last
Judgement gives one much pause for speculation.
I was especially drawn to Ambrosius Benson's Mary Magdalene and to
Jacob de Backer's Garden of Eden in which the young lovers have such
innocent faces. Anton Claessens also painted two beauties representing
poetry and music in his Mars, Surrounded by the Liberal Arts.
Surfeited with culture, a boat ride around the canal offers the
pleasure of viewing pleasant ''housescapes''. Even a fine rain failed to
dampen the exuberant spirit of brolly-covered boating parties.
A very special Bruges treat is a cosy supper at Den Dyver (the Beer
Kitchen) where every dish is cooked in beer and the house menu includes
all the beer you can drink. Langoustines simmered in light hopsbeer were
as delicious as they were unexpected. Of the 350-plus Belgian beers they
stock, two are brewed in Bruges, Brugse Tripel (very strong) and Brugs
Beertje. Ask for a ''Staffe Hendrik'', which means ''strong Henry'', but
remember that while it may be only nine degrees proof and wine is seven
degrees, you are apt to drink a lot more beer. Small wonder that one pub
refuses to serve more than three beers to any customer. (Just one strong
beer -- the lager look-alike is the strongest -- and I was weaving like
a sailor.)
One meal must include Belgium's equivalent to fish and chips --
mussels and chips -- and the chips for which Belgium is justifiably
famous, are hot, thin and crispy. If the weather is warm, sit outside at
one of the many restaurants opposite the Belfry in the Grote Markt, the
vast square that is the heart of Bruges. Here on a Sunday morning, we
happened upon a band concert.
The nearby alternative square, the Burg, is dominated by civic,
religious and judicial buildings. The twelfth-century Basilica of the
Holy Blood has held the relic since the Second Crusade in 1149. On
another side of the Burg are the steep Mansard roofs and dormer windows
of the fifteenth-century baroque Court of Justice. On a third side
stands the Gothic town hall, the oldest in Belgium, dating from the
thirteenth century.
Burgermeister and aldermen still meet in its gilt, red and black
council chamber decorated with coats of arms and a painting
commemorating the Battle of the Golden Spurs, fought on July 11, 1302 --
a battle against the French that the Flemish won -- the only battle they
have ever won against the French. Bruges couples are married beneath
this splendid display of national pride.
Charity-minded Bruges has no fewer than 33 almshouse communities,
providing homes for more than 300 people, usually in courtyards, some
dating from the thirteenth century. One such courtyard, the Begijnage,
where A Nun's Story was filmed, originally served from the twelfth to
the fifteenth century as a home for the wives of crusaders, who were
often absent for several years. Today it is occupied by a Benedictine
order of Swiss nuns, who still wear the traditional black gowns and
white headdresses.
Only three years ago another order in Bruges, the Poor Sisters of St
Clare, made international news. It had always been the duty of the Poor
Sisters to pray for the weather, so they were often paid by farmers with
offerings of eggs. Although their numbers dwindled, they continued to
prosper -- every bride made offerings in the hope of a sunny wedding
day. Then suddenly, the sisters, their ages ranging from 62 to 94, upped
sticks, piled into a Mercedes and moved off to the South of France where
they bought a farm. When the story hit the international press, the
bishop took a dim view of their adventure and the sisters were recalled
to Bruges. (I can hardly wait for the movie.)
Bruges also figured in British history when Charles II, to escape
Cromwell, took up residence for a few years in the city, along with his
brother, the Duke of Gloucester. To bide his time and enter into Brugian
life, Charles joined the Guild of Crossbowmen.
Such a charming, clean and tidy, small city locked in its own medieval
time warp, it is easy to appreciate Bruges's appeal. Good food, good
beer, and in relatively recent years, historically speaking, good
chocolate. The Sukerbuyc (Sugarbelly) chocolate factory in
Katelijnestraat, for instance, offers 80 different flavoured fillings.

A VITAL conference begins today in Lisbon which could well have long
term repercussions for the scotch whisky industry and possibly even the
British brewers.
The European Commission conference on excise duties is being attended
by around 350 representatives of industries which effectively raise tax
of behalf of governments such as drink, tobacco, and fuel.
It has been called by Tax Commissioner Mario Monti in what is seen by
many as being a last attempt to preserve his credibility of his attempts
to widen the European Union single market.
Last month, the British director-general in charge of customs and
excise Peter Wilmott was sacked by Mr Monti in what was widely regarded
within the commission as making him a scapegoat by blaming Mr Wilmott
for his own shortcomings and inactivity.
The sticking point has been the conflict between the wine producing
countries, where excise duty is at minimal rates, and the spirit
distillers who object to what they say is fiscal distortion which leads
to grossly unfair competition.
The crucial issue is that of defining levels of taxation that will
enable spirits to compete within in the various national markets.
Most exposed is scotch, where arguments that it should be taxed in
proportion to the amount of alcohol per unit, rather than its definition
or category of alcoholic drink, have been persistently undermined by the
British taxation system. That which places a bigger burden on
domestically produced spirit than in any other country worldwide.
Attempts to have the duty rate reduced in both European countries and
in other parts of the world have been undermined by the question as to
why an importing country should give a more favourable tax treatment
than does Chancellor Kenneth Clarke, who raised duty rates last
December.
It seems virtually certain that the wine producers who account for
eight out of the 15 EU members will refuse, for electoral and social
reasons, to increase or even introduce tax on wine.
The best hope for the distillers would be some agreement for an
orderly reduction in the duty rates over a period of time, although in
national terms the lead will have to come from the UK which produces
about 52% of all European spirits.
The three day meeting in the Portugese capital will also hear a call
from the combined trade associations of all the European brewery
industries as well as Norway and Switzerland for a reducution in beer
excise duties to the lowest possible level. This is the only way that
will reduce fraud and cross-border distortion of trade, it is claimed.
To coincide with the conference, the free market think-tank Adam Smith
Institute called for the abolition of different minimum rates of duty
across EU countries which consolidate the price distortions, by allowing
the same product to be sold at three times less in one EU country than
in another.
It said that the Chancellor now faces a serious threat to revenues by
over-taxing drink and tobacco.
should cut duty on spirits by 10% a year for five years, freeze the
rates of duty of duty on beer and wine, and also freeze or even cut
rates on tobacco. it added.

<HEADLINE>Potato trade group warns on Brown Rot</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IF the deadly bacterial disease Potato Brown Rot were to become
established in Scotland it could destroy the country's seed potato
industry valued at #50m, the Scottish Potato Trade Association has
warned, writes ROBERT ROSS.
David Stewart, president, said the disease was known to be on at least
50 farms in Holland and its spread to Scotland would be devastating.
While welcoming moves by the Scottish Office to restrict the import of
Dutch seed, he argued that a complete ban on imports should have been
imposed.
''We have made this point repeatedly in meetings with the Scottish
office and other industry bodies over the past few weeks,'' he said.
The Scottish Agriclture Minister, the Earl of Lindsay, has advised
against the importation of Dutch seed and made an order that
notification should be given of all consignments already in the country
so that they can be tested.
''Until two years ago Scotland and the northern countries of England
enjoyed protected region status, which meant all imported potatoes had
to go through quarantine before being released for commercial
production,'' said Mr Stewart.
''That status was lost with the introduction of the so-called single
market. We warned at the time that such a move was highly dangerous in
terms of plant health. The present battle to keep Potato Brown Rot out
of Scotland is clear proof that we were right.''
Mr Stewart argued that the next step should be the re-introduction by
the EU of full protected area status for all qualifying regions
throughout the Union.
''In the meantime, it remains imperative that all Scottish potato
growers follow the Scottish Office advice not to bring Dutch seed into
the country,'' he said. ''We don't have Potato Brown Rot, we definitely
don't want it so don't import it.''

THERE'S still no sign of the famine relief but I have been assured
that they're not sending me to jail for claiming that extra acre of
set-aside. They would have, if the computer had picked up the error,
but, as I had told them myself, they were just amending my form and
paying me as usual -- only later than everybody else. Once again,
Fortune has favoured the chicken.
I do believe them but there will be a helluva party when it arrives.
Perhaps I should say ''another helluva party''. This week we had the
annual Fisherman's Dinner. That marks the end of another year in the
lives of those who spend most of the season standing by the riverbank
waving a long stick and drowning worms in the Ythan Water.
If it is true that in tallying up a man's three score years and ten
the good Lord doesn't count time spent fishing, he must multiply by at
least ten the time spent at the Fisherman's Dinner.
It was Mossie who got me involved. ''Oh no,'' he said, ''I dinna fish,
but I go to the dinner. It's traditional, and a body must go an support
the thing.''
I'll say this for Mossie, if he supports a thing he supports it all
the way. He had a table for eight to which I was invited. But our table
wasn't ''half-past seven for eight'' like the rest of them. We had to
appear at Moss-side for cork-popping and clay pigeon shooting at four.
Then, when it was dark, we had to go down to the Salmon Inn for a couple
of hours which made us late.
It is easy to see that Mossie's famine relief has arrived. Whenever
anybody pulls his leg about the subsidies he says, ''Oh I ken. I just
told them to put the cheque straight to the Salmon. I wouldnae risk
putting it to Moss-side first -- the wife might see it.''
Anyway, by the time Mossie's table staggered into the dinner there was
no table for us. So we were interspersed among the anglers of
Aberdeenshire, or so we thought.
There are those who think of no torture so bad as a whole evening
listening to fishers discussing their flies, their minnows and the ones
that got away, but I'm not like that.
Little Ardo has about 300 yards of the Ythan, including at least two
good salmon lies, and I fished there often as a boy. But my real
passion, and it was really that, was to go off for the day up the wee
burns and worm for brown trout.
When I was seven I was given a beautiful little greenheart rod by Jack
Martin who had a small chain of upmarket sporting tackle shops across
Scotland. Jack taught me to use it in a tiny burn about a mile up
Glendevon from the Yetts o' Muckhart.
Many years were to pass between those first lessons and my return to
the glen, and when I saw my first trout stream I couldn't believe how
small it was. A decent stallion could produce a bigger flow.
And yet when old Mr Martin took me fishing there 50 years ago, it was
a fair burn and teeming with trout which were large in comparison with
the fisherman.
We caught one each. I remember mine well indeed. I could take you to
the very spot, about 20 yards above the trickle which we knew as the
waterfall. I felt it wriggling on the line and as though to that manor
born threw it out over my head and in among the heather.
Mr Martin explained that it had to be seven inches long before we
could keep it. That meant the length of a man's hand. I remember being
so glad when he said that, as I was the catcher, my hand would have to
be used for the measuring rather than his.
That was the start of many happy years of worming in the burnies
scorned by people with double snooter hats and waders. I never caught so
many trout that we couldn't eat them at a sitting, but I nearly always
got something. I think that is why I preferred the wee burns. I couldn't
go away for days on end like salmon fishers and come back with nothing
but cold feet.
Some years on the Ythan there is hardly a fish taken but this year has
been quite good. Just the week before last Willie Adie, who was once our
second tractorman and was later our postie, had an 18 pounder. And yet
that was only his second fish of the season.
So, with Mossie's table scattered like the children of Israel, the
Farmer decided to talk fish.
To the man on the right, ''Did you get a fish this year?''
''No I dinna fish.''
To the man on my left, ''Did you get a fish this year?''
''No I dinna fish.''
Two down on the left I found my first fisher but he hadn't been out
this year and I had to go to three down on the right to get a real
fisher.
But he had a fisherman's story to beat them all. Never mind two fish
in a season, he'd had nine in one short evening.
Big Massey is a gamekeeper whose job it is to worry about pheasants
and, as such, he regards salmon as low life and fair game. He was out
trying to cut down the fox population one night when he saw a light on
the water. He recognised the sounds of poachers.
Waiting until the bag was secure he blew his whistle and flashed his
torch. The poachers ran off and left him with a hundredweight of salmon.
* Farmer's Diary Volume 4 with Turnbull's cartoons is now available in
hardback from good bookshops at 11.95 or plus #1 by post from Ardo,

stocking-filler but it should fit comfortably into a pillow-case.

MORE than 30% of Scotland's farming output is now being marketed
through co-operatives as more producers join forces in search of
increased commercial strength.
John Don, president of the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society,
the umbrella organisation for Scotland's farm co-operatives, will
highlight that statistic today when he addresses the annual general
meeting of the SAOS at Dunblane.
During the past 12 months SAOS staff had worked on more than 60
development projects and had completed 32 commercial assignments, said
Mr Don.
''The result is that Scottish farmers have more control over their own
businesses than before,'' he added. ''We lead the UK in co-operative
development and are no longer seen as beginners in terms of European
farm co-operation.''
Mr Don said that SAOS specialist consultancy work had grown by 40%
over the past year, delivering practical solutions to businesses in all
sectors of the industry.
''Our project list includes an evaluation of managed labour services
in five separate parts of the Highlands and Islands; a number of lamb
group developments; pig marketing projects and wild venison marketing.
We are also working on alternative crops, rural tourism, fishing and
fish farming.''
SAOS turnover for the year ending March 1995 was #586,598, compared
with #442,508 the previous year.

ELECTION fever may not yet have gripped the country but there is a
stirring of interest in matters political which means that people on
public platforms are choosing their words carefully.
You could almost see Sandy Inverarity, chairman of the Scottish
Agricultural College doling out his praise with careful measure last
week at the annual outlook conference at Ingliston.
Dr Gavin Strang, the Labour Party's shadow agriculture minister had
given the opening address giving his assessment of the radical reforms
needed in the Common Agricultural Policy.
Sandy commented that it appeared the Labour Party had really thought
through its policy on where it wanted to see agriculture going.
Being in Opposition, he mused, had its advantages. It gave people time
to think.
''The party in Government doesn't have time to think,'' he added.
Ministers had too much on their plate -- running their departments and
still acting as constituency MPs. That did not give the party in power
time to think at all.
It is an interesting theory. It could explain a lot. I think we all
know what he meant.
There is little doubt that political antennae are being tuned in to
the possibility of influencing the farming vote. John Scott, the hill
farming convener was warning about the threat of devolution at the NFUS
council the other week. Gavin Strang did not miss the chance to put the
opposite view to the outlook conference.
The farming world has its own election in prospect in March of next
year when members of the NFUS will have to select a successor to John
Ross as president.
Here too the tempo is rising with three and a half candidates already
declared. The half being former vice-president Maitland Mackie who is
prepared to run -- if asked by a group of folk who share his views on
the union. He says that such a call is unlikely. Or does he just want to
be seen being propelled reluctantly towards the chair?
To be scrupulously fair we should give the names of the other
contenders -- vice-presidents Sandy Mole and Stewart Whiteford and
animal welfare convener George Lyon. The electioneering battle will be
interesting.
Meanwhile, John Ross looks unlikely to have a quiet run up to his
retirement. One of his main concerns is convincing the Government of the
case for an increase in Hill Land Compensatory Allowances. He will be in
Inverness today to press the case on MP's representing Highlands and
Islands constituencies. His message is that the level of HLCA's is not
sufficient to provide the compensation needed to sustain farming in
these severely disadvantaged areas.
He also has another foray north planned, to meet the Aberdeenshire and
Kincardine area executive who have been complaining that
''headquarters'' is trying to dictate how the executive should go about
its business. In particular the members say that efforts have been made
in the past to persuade their secretary to water down motions passed by
the executive before transmitting them to Edinburgh. The meeting will be
lively, which is no bad thing.
Another issue which Mr Ross could resolve before he demits office is
the disagreement with Rural Forum over its submission to the Select
Committee on Scottish Affairs. The NFUS has resigned from the forum
because that submission listed them as members of the forum and went on
to make comments on the CAP which the union sees as ''seriously at odds
with union policy''.
There is a body of opinion with the NFUS council which suggests that
it would have been better to remain in membership of the forum and argue
the case from within. Some of those who articulate that view are from
the Aberdeen area and doubtless will press that point when they meet the
president.
The forum document called for the development of a strategy for a
future rural economy where production subsidies are diminished. It may
not be official union policy but it is a view which can be raised in
polite society without causing the heavens to fall in. Many serious
commentators have been voicing a similar opinion at conferences and
seminars up and down the country. De-coupling is becoming very much an
''in'' word.
However, there are signs that reconciliation may be possible. The
union has indicated that it is willing to discuss with Rural Forum the
way it does business. Rural Forum, for its part, would like to see the
NFUS back in the fold, so the omens are good.
One thing is certain, whoever first coined the phrase ''rural idyll''
was not a farmers' union activist.

THE dispersal of Douglas Crighton's Broadmeadows herd of pedigree
Limousin cattle attracted a huge crowd at Carlisle on Saturday and
produced a quite outstanding sale.
The overall average for the 44 lots was #7156.70 with a further 19
cross bred females carrying either embryos or with pure calves at foot
averaging #2823.95 bringing the gross takings to over #372,000.

THE first clues to the performance of the economy in the final quarter
of the year will emerge this week from a battery of economic statistics.
Following last week's upbeat distributive trades survey from the
Confederation of British Industry, Wednesday's retail sales figures will
be closely scrutinised.
Analysts are expecting an upturn in retail sales after the flat
performance in September when volume was in fact 0.4% lower than in
September last year.
James Capel's Adam Cole has pencilled in a rise of 0.5% to take sales
to 0.4% above the level of October of last year. But if the CBI survey,
which found a sharp increase in sales last month, turns out to be an
accurate guide, Cole would not be surprised by a rise of over 1% on the
month.
On the same day come October's unemployment figures, projected to
produce a seasonally adjusted drop of around 20,000, after September's
27,200. Capel expects average earnings edged up from 3.25% to 3.5% in
September.
On Thursday the inflation figures will send out mixed signals.
Headline inflation in October is expected to be unchanged, allowing the
annual rate to drop back from 3.9% in September to 3.7%. The figures
benefit from the latest mortgage rate cut and the annual rate from a
mortgage rise last year dropping out of the calculations.
But the RPI measure, which excludes mortgage payments, is likely to
rise by 0.2% on the month and the annual rate will jump from 3.1% in
September to 3.4%.
Better news may emerge from October's producer price figures, due
later today. Cole is forecasting a fall of 0.5% in input prices on the
back of a stronger pound and weaker commodity prices. This would result
in input price inflation declining from 9.5% in September to 8.3%.
Factory gate prices are expected to rise by 0.2% lifting the annual
rate to 4.6% from 4.5%. Cole believes this will be close to the peak in
factory gate price inflation.
Good Public Sector Borrowing Requirement figures are on the cards on
Thursday. October is a corporation tax paying month and in addition the
figures will be boosted by expected privatisation proceed of around
#1500m.
Cole is forecasting a debt repayment of about #2000m but warns that
there are great uncertainties over the likely outcome.
TODAY -- Producer prices (October).
TOMORROW -- None announced.
WEDNESDAY -- Retail sales (October); unemployment (October); average
earnings (September).
THURSDAY -- Retail price index (October); Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement (October).
FRIDAY -- None announced.

FORMER bus driver Frank Reid is enjoying his new three dimensional
lifestyle as proprietor of Up Front Designs.
Mr Reid swopped the driving seat of a Strathclyde double decker to
take the driving seat of his own business two years ago, and hasn't
looked back since.
The change was not as dramatic as it first seems, as Mr Reid had been
a record promoter for 11 years before opting for the ''quieter life'' of
a bus driver.
However, he became restless in his new career, but found it difficult
to convince people that a bus driver could market their business. Mr
Reid believed he was stuck in a rut until he attended a Dunbartonshire
Enterprise Teamstart course.
''I attended the course in the evenings, and had to change my shifts
with other drivers so that I could get along,'' said Mr Reid.
However, even after completing the course the bus driver still found
it difficult to establish his credibility.
''I drove buses for a year after the course but then I was asked to
design a stand for the Europartenariat in the SECC,'' he said.
The exhibition stand for Clancast, who produce plaster moulds for
architects, won the award for being the best designed stand in its
category, and was featured on television.
''This gave me credibility,'' said Mr Reid, ''and I was able to start
my business, and attract customers.''
Mr Reid began his working life as a window dresser from Trerons store,
Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow before moving on to Cuthbertsons, the music
store where he began to become involved in promotions.
''I then joined EMI, and promoted their records throughout Scotland
and Northern Ireland for eight years,'' Mr Reid said.
After a spell as a freelance record promoter Frank decided to change
careers and joined the buses, but in December 1993 formed Up Front
Designs which said Mr Reid specialised in three-dimensional marketing
techniques rather than just flat graphics.
From his base in Kirkintilloch, Mr Reid now works for among others a
top High Street retailer, a Scottish recording company, and a drinks
industry company who wanted Up Front to design packaging for its bottle
tops.

NINE years ago Douglas Lamb and David Protheroe were studying at
Glasgow University.
Mr Lamb was studying physics and maths, and saw his future in the
electronics industry while Mr Protheroe's course was topography and he
expected to progress on to a career in chartered surveying exploring for
oil.
Neither achieved their ambition. Instead they converted their summer
jobs making boxes into a thriving business. Boxshop in East Kilbride is
the result.
The company now employs 55 people and this year will have a turnover
of #2.75m.
''During our holidays David and I both worked in my father's box
making factory,'' said Mr Lamb, ''He suggested that there was a niche in
the market for a company which could supply small orders for fifty to a
hundred boxes to companies.''
The pair scraped together #7000 and bought a box making machine which
they installed in a tiny corner of Mr Lamb's father's factory.
There first order was from a whisky company for 50 boxes, but in the
first year they recorded a turnover of #100,000.
''We were both used to living on our student grant, and still lived
with our respective parents,'' said Mr Protheroe, ''which meant that we
did not need a lot of money. Any money we made we invested in new
machinery.''
Boxshop's first company car was a Lada Estate because it could carry
boxes as well as themselves.
''The garage was doing a special deal offering a #1000 trade in on any
car off the estate which cost #4000. We went along to the garage, and
expressed our interest in the deal.
''The owner asked what car we planned to trade in, and we explained
that we were just going to buy any old banger and bring it along to him.
He told us not to bother and gave us the car for #3000 anyway,'' said Mr
Lamb.
Boxshop has come a long way since then and are now in the first year
of a three year programme of expansion with the help of Regional
Selective Assistance from the Scottish Office.
They recently invested #250,000 in a new piece of machinery which will
help them to be more flexible.
Next year they plan to invest #350,000 in computer aided design and
graphics equipment to allow them to provide a higher quality of design,
and the following year they plan to build an extend their factory space.
''We expect to be employing around 75 people by the end of the three
year project and our turnover should be approaching #5m,'' said Mr Lamb.
Little wonder that earlier this month Boxshop won an award at the
LDA's Lanarkshire Business Awards.

GLENCAIRN Crystal Studio has been supplying industry with its
glassware for a number of years, but four months ago Tom Searle joined
the company and launched a new retail division.
Already, retail sales have reached what the East Kilbride company had
hoped to achieve in its first twelve months.
The main reason behind this success is Glencairn Crystal Studio
Retail's new Charles Rennie Mackintosh design, which has taken the gift
market by storm.
''No-one in crystal has done Rennie Mackintosh designs on a
substantial scale. I expected a positive response but the level of sales
has been phenomenal,'' said Mr Searle, who is managing director of the
new Glencairn retail division.
Already Glencairn is supplying 100 outlets in Scotland, and it expects
this to double within the next year.
At the recent Made in Scotland, craft and gift trade fair in Aviemore
last month, it put its designs on public display for the first time, and
was delighted with the response.
''As a result of Aviemore we have a potential distributor for New
Zealand and Australia,'' said Mr Searle, ''and we are also now selling
in Ireland.''
Before expanding into retail sales, Glencairn concentrated on
supplying the corporate market, and was the largest suppliers of
decanters to the Scotch whisky industry but there name was unknown to
the public.
Recently Glencairn produced a replica of the historic ''Jacobite
Glass'' for the Scottish Scotch Whisky Heritage Centre. It was used by
those loyal to the exiled Stewart King to toast his health. The replica
glass will be used during commemorations of the '45 Jacobite Rebellion.
''We have our own in house designers, and have other designs in the
pipleline to make sure that we are not relying solely on the Mackintosh
lines,'' said Mr Searle, who has 20 years experience in the crystal
industry.
''We do not see Glencairn Retail being in the crystal market, but
focusing on the gift market,'' said Mr Searle. ''We believe that there
is significant growth available in this sector.''
The company expects to begin exporting to Europe and America next
year, although it is limiting the number of new outlets they supply at
present, in order to meet demand from existing customers.
''Even although we have only been supplying the retail market for four
months we are finding that existing customers are returning with repeat
orders, and this is limiting our expansion into new markets,'' said Mr
Searle.
However, Glencairn believes that its Mackintosh designs will mirror
the success that the designs had in the jewellery trade, which should
add a lot of sparkle to their performance.

ANDREW Lloyd Webber intends widening his interests from musicals to
newspapers and is prepared to put up as much as #100m as part of a
consortium bid to buy the Express titles from Lord Stevens' United News
&amp; Media group.
His Really Useful Group has been investigating the potential and
practicalities of buying the Daily Express, the Sunday Express an the
down-market Daily Star as well as the regional papers including the
flagship Yorkshire Post.
Altogether the papers operate out of 23 different centres and there is
substantial scope for cost-cutting.
Mr Lloyd Webber's personal fortune has been estimated at #380m thanks
to the royalties and other profits from hits such as Evita, Cats, and a
host of other musicals.
The Express titles have been in long-term decline for many years and
there has been City pressure on Lord Stevens to sell out and concentrate
on the more profitable advertising and magazine sides which now
contribute well over half group profits.

WAYS of overcoming the low start-up rate of small businesses in
Scotland will be examined at a prestigious conference this week at the
University of Paisley.
The 18th Institute for Small Business Affairs Conference, which opens
on Wednesday, has taken as its theme Entrepreneurship in the '90s and
follows a special inquiry by Scottish Enterprise into the issue.
The Chief Executive of Scottish Enterprise, Crawford Beveridge, will
outline his policy aim ''to at least equal the UK average of the annual
number of new businesses created per head of the population by the end
of the 1990s''
This would mean a 50% increase in the number of new businesses started
each year by the end of the decade, and the creation of an additional
25,000 businesses.
Speakers will include Mr Alex Salmond, Leader of the Scottish National
Party, Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's shadow Trade and Industry spokesman,
and Ms Vivian Brown, the head of the Small Firms and Business Links
Division at the Department of Trade and Industry.
They will be joined by leading academics will will present the latest
research findings on entrepreneurship in the '90s.
Conference themes will include: entrepreneurship and economic
development; entrepreneurship and innovation; female entrepreneurship;
ethnic minority entrepreneurship; and entrepreneurship and education.

LABOUR leader Tony Blair will today tell the Confederation of British
Industry meeting in Birmingham that a Labour government will be
committed to low inflation, low borrowing, fair taxes, and the market
economy.
''We must become a nation of entrepreneurs,'' Mr Blair will tell the
industrialists on the opening day of their conference.
He will dismiss the Tory promise to make Britain the enterprise centre
of Europe as a ''fantasy'' undermined by the lack of education and
training in the workforce.
However, the Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine will also address
the conference today launching a swift counter-attack, pledging to make
Britain the enterprise centre of Europe.
He is expected to ridicule Labour's claims to be the only party which
can lift the country out of recession and place it on the path to
lasting prosperity.
Yesterday the CBI renewed its call on the Chancellor not to take any
risks with public borrowing in his Budget.
CBI President Sir Bryan Nicholson said that the CBI did not oppose tax
cuts, but would only welcome them if funded by credible cuts in public
spending.
Sir Bryan's remarks were backed up by a survey of CBI members showing
95% of respondents would prefer any discretionary loosening of public
borrowing to be constrained to less than #3000m, while only 5% wanted
larger tax cuts. Some 63% of businesses surveyed opposed public capital
spending cuts.
There was strong pressure for any personal tax reduction to be in the
form of an above-inflation increase in personal tax allowances and
further incentives for the lower paid.
The CBI's fourth annual report on manufacturing, also released
yesterday, shows that UK manufacturers are closing the gap with their
principal competitors despite the slow down in the domestic economy.
However it warns that it is vital that company's do not relax in the
drive to improve competitiveness.
Manufacturing productivity and performance has improved in many UK
companies but there are still far too many under-achieving their
potential. The manufacturers report claimed the UK is now more
attractive than at any time in its recent past, attracting business back
and also strong inward investment.
To help companies improve their performance, the employers' body has
launched a computer-based benchmarking initiative -- Probe -- which is
based on a computer database of more than 800 manufacturing sites in
Europe.
The Labour leader is expected to use his visit to continue his wooing
of industry and the city. He will also commit the Labour Party to:
* Set a clear low inflation target.
* Ensure penal tax rates were ''gone for good''.
* Review corporation tax to boost investment.
* Borrow only for investment with medium-term debt repayments.
* Bring in tax relief for certain savings.
Mr Blair is also expected to place great emphasis on the importance of
education and of building a society that will stick together.
Mr Adair Turner, director general of the CBI, said business welcomed
the overall tone of Labour's approach to industry.
However, he added that there were still differences in a number of
areas, including the planned introduction of a national minimum wage and
Labour's commitment to end the social chapter opt-out.
Delegates at the conference would be eager to hear Mr Blair clarify
Labour's approach to the control of inflation as well as tax
arrangements, Mr Turner said. ''We will want to see if Labour has
rejected the politics of envy.''
Aside from these two big guns, attention will centre on a fringe
meeting being held by the former Tory leadership challenger John Redwood
MP, in which he will oppose the CBI's overwhelming pro-European stance.
A recent poll of CBI and British Chambers of Commerce members has
showed a strongly favourable view of European Union, allied with some
annoyance at the perceived damage Tory sniping at almost all levels
against the EU has caused.
Among official speakers on Europe at the actual conference itself is
European commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, but the main business leaders
anyway would all be expected to take a pro-European line.
This, though, is only one aspect of the conference, which tomorrow
after speeches by the President of the Board of Trade, Ian Lang, Mr
Adair Turner, and Sir Bryan Nicholson.
The first session of the conference covers Europe and this is to be
followed by sessions on competitiveness, the economy, education, and
transport.
Transport is regarded as particularly important, not least in the
light of reports of substantial cutbacks in road building plans thought
likely to be announced in the Budget on November 28.
The CBI has already stated that among priorities for 1996 the
Government must act to prevent congestion from worsening. This applies
to major conurbations around the UK and major routes between cities. It
also applies to air travel, where there are strains on airports and air
space capacity and rail at peak times.
Speakers at the transport session will include Robert Napier, chief
executive of Redland and John Wybew, Shell UK's director of corporate
affairs, and Graham Miller, operations director of William Younger and
president of the Freight Transport Association.
There is also strong disappointment at the lack of progress of the
Private Finance Initiative which is the Government's plan for extending
private sector involvement in the financing and management of public
sector investment.
This will obviously get a considerable airing at the meeting. The CBI
has been working on an examination of this but publication will not be
until sometime after the conference.

THE increase in popularity of conservatories has meant increased
business for Cairn Conservatories who have doubled their capacity and
their turnover in the past year.
Mr Phillip Pain and his fellow director Walter MacGowan are now
supplying conservatories for private homes and hotels throughout
Scotland.
''Families now use conservatories as an extra room added to their home
while hotels use them to provide light airy restaurants, and they are
also used to provide cover for outside swimming pools,'' Mr Pain said.
The company was first established in Arbroath in 1984 but when Mr
Pain's original business partner retired in 1991 Cairn Conservatories
closed their manufacturing unit in the East and purchased Killearn
Sawmills to the north of Glasgow.
Their new location on the main Glasgow to Aberfoyle route made the
company ''more visible'' and this led to an increase in business.
''We bought the sawmill site from a relative of Waltern MacGowans. His
family had owned the sawmills for 150 years,'' said Mr Pain, ''and it
was nice to retain the connection.''
Cairn Conservatories range in price from #7500 to #75,000, an
indication how large are some of the constructions.
''We have built conservatories for hotels such as the Kincaid House
Hotel and also the Isle of Glencoe at Ballachuish as well as other
public venues such as the Puppet Theatre in Glasgow,'' said Mr Pain.
Recently, with assistance from Stirling Enterprise, the company
extended its factory to introduce a UPVC range to complement their
timber framed output.
This additional production facility has led to an increase in staff
from 14 to 20.
''We are never going to be a CR Smith,'' said Mr Pain, ''but we will
continue to achieve consistent growth. We do double glazing for a
customer if it is part of the overall job, but we don't chase that type
of work. We are mainly in one off units which we design ourselves.''

Clare Henry explains how a family's darkest moments inspired a
mother's message in her art
AN inner glow radiates from Victoria Crowe's new paintings, showing at
The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh. It's the magic of golden Italianate
light mixed with a heady brew of lush and lovely flowers, angels,
Sienese altarpieces and gentle valleys scattered with cypress trees.
Normally her oils are restrained, shadowy and dark yet here is a glory
in life; a wine-rich radiance, an abundance of magnificent and fruitful
nature pulsating in all its fecundity.
Looking at these life-enhancing pictures, brave in colour and spirit,
one would never guess that Crowe's family has recently faced their
darkest moments when her son Ben became seriously ill. Work can provide
both a rock and solace, something important and creative to aspire to in
defiance of despair. To face it out and overcome. That is the message
here.
''It puts things into perspective,'' she explained. ''I'll never be
afraid again. I can attack a canvas: throw in colour, contrast, and
compositions I never dreamed of before. I feel I've gone through some
kind of doorway with this work and am in a place I've never been
before.''
Votives for a Male Child says it all. It's one of the quietest
pictures in the show yet is the essence of it. Her son's hauntingly
handsome, very vulnerable profile looks away out of the picture to the
left. At the bottom right is a repeating but smaller monochrome
rectangle inspired by the metal good-luck charms you find in Greek
churches offered by parents for their children.
Between the two dark notes is a beautiful, classical Donatello head,
almost imperceptible at first but once seen it dominates the picture: a
guardian angel to keep you safe. The guardian is serene, secure,
timeless, universal, unchanging, permanent. It is what we wish for our
children. Once recognised, it's the focus and power of the whole. Anyone
fearful for the well-being of a beloved will empathise with this image.
Strangely Crowe, now 50, had never been to Italy till 1992, though she
had visited Russia regularly and loves Byzantine icons. ''I'd been
saving Italy up,'' she smiles. The impact was tremendous, but in fact
all the ingredients were already there in her work: the love of
intricate iconography, of art history, of light, of multi-layered
strands of seeing.
Crowe's sub-texts are all-important. Because she draws superbly,
relishes the manipulation of paint and is a master of the medium, she
worries that she'll be regarded as an artist who merely transcribes what
she sees and that the underlying core and wealth of symbolism will be
overlooked.
''Don't mention the flowers,'' she pleaded, but in fact her tangled
bouquets, the white hydrangeas of Virgil in Siena or West Twilight, the
calligraphy sprays of dried grasses in Dreaming World or the waxy church
lilies as found in every Italian church and every Annunciation painting
are one of the glories of the show. As she points out: ''Flowers have
such extraordinary, often ominous, evil forms, that they could be
creatures from the depths!''
This undertow of the sinister was always present in her work -- but
never so deeply felt as now.
Other favourite subjects include many 1940s and 50s Bakelite dishes,
boxes, toys, and ashtrays: bric-a-brac which she inherited from her West
Linton shepherd friend Jenny, who she often painted in the 1980s.
''All the stuff she'd accumulated on her shelves took on a deep and
mysterious symbolism for me. And when she became housebound I began to
look at landscape through her windows, noticing vignettes of nature at
one remove. It's even more startling when glimpsed from inside.'' Crowe
went on to play on this inside-outside aspect, also using mirrors to
question what she calls ''the casual reality of things''.
A trip to Pompeii this spring inspired several bold fresco style
figures dancing with ritual Roman abandon, while Pompeian red features
in small rich, still lifes of black, red and white, Votives, Charms and
Illusions.
Crowe finds drawing ''a nourishing activity'', a point proved by
sketchbooks from her travels, which include a spell in Poland and
Extremadura, Spain, working on the World Wildlife Fund's Artists for
Nature projects. Trained at Kingston and the Royal College, Crowe was
enticed to Edinburgh by Robin Philipson who saw her 1968 degree show and
she has taught part-time at Edinburgh ever since.
Portraiture is another string to her bow, and she has immortalised
many famous figures, including R D Laing, Winifred Rushford, Tam
Dalyell, the Earl of Wemyss, and Kathleen Raine, but in this show her
son and the poet Valerie Gillies feature. None the less, this is
unquestionably her best show: paintings of heart-piercing beauty and
powerful symbolism which require an emotional response. None of us know
our fate or destiny. We can but pray for strength on our journey.
Crowe has strength and skill, imagination and integrity.
* Victoria Crowe: New Paintings is at The Scottish Gallery, Dundas
Street, Edinburgh to November 29.

THERE were a number of striking features about the first convention of
CATS -- the Cornet and Trumpet Association -- which took place
throughout the weekend at Glasgow's Henry Wood Hall.
Sponsored by Yamaha, the convention embraced music ranging from the
Bronze Age -- literally, the rituals and battle calls of Celtic warlords
on fearsome primitive instruments -- to the music of today. In the words
of Nigel Boddice, artistic director of the two-day convention, it ranged
from ''the contemporary to the baroque, and all stops in between''.
Around 50 star trumpet and cornet players (plus big bands) from all
walks of the profession -- jazzmen, session men, brass band men, Royal
Scottish Academy students, sections from the Scottish orchestras --
featured in a glittering array of recitals.
The purpose of the weekend was to create a platform for all aspects of
trumpet and cornet playing. Unfortunately, the event failed to attract
much attention or attendance from a wider public. Audiences tended to be
comprised of those with vested or trade interests, and other performers
(though, since there were a lot of them, most of the events were in fact
well attended).
While, to an outsider, any relationship between cornet and trumpet
might not have been clearly established, there was absolutely no problem
identifying the quality of performances delivered. Roger Webster, former
principal with the Black Dyke Mills Band, and -- by reputation -- one of
the great cornet players of the day, laid down the criteria for cornet
playing in a smooth and mellifluous set of performances.
In jazz, the ground covered ranged from the flowing flugelhorn
improvisations on classics such as Autumn Leaves and My Funny Valentine
by Paul Eshelby, principal with the BBC Big Band and top session man
(despite the fact that he was hindered by a four-square and earthbound
rhythm section), to the stellar shrieks of Bruce Adams, who had the
joint jumping with his stratospheric solos.
On the classical front, the ground covered was enormous, with a very
good representation of contemporary music, including a little-known work
by Martin Dalby, dexterously handled by the RSAMD trumpet section, Don
Strattons's anarchic Suite for Seven Undependable Trumpet Players, tough
pieces by Tom David Wilson and Keith Amos stunningly played by the Orfeo
Consort, and a dazzling performance by Nigel Boddice and 20-year-old
Bathgate lass, Angela Whelan -- a real star in the making -- of Edward
McGuire's brilliantly atmospheric Orbit.
The convention seemed a truly interactive event, with players from
every field and every discipline tuning in to each other. (The only pity
was the mass bale-out for an informative and chacteristically
entertaining lecture-demonstration by music archaeologist John Purser.)
There was a genuine buzz to the convention -- even at 10 in the
morning -- and what seems certain is that it will happen again, though
next time probably down south, and with a more concerted attempt to
attract the attention of the public at large.

Carole Woddis talks to Julia Pascal about a personal odyssey which has
culminated in her Holocaust Trilogy which opens in London this week
WHY would anyone want to write a trilogy about the Holocaust? The
subject itself is so immense and defies any kind of easy or
one-dimensional analysis. This week however, and for three weeks at a
small north-London theatre (with awful aptness in a building that was
previously a mortuary), Manchester-writer and director Julia Pascal's
Holocaust Trilogy attempts to look at it from a few, highly personal
angles.
Presenting the trilogy in its entirety for the first time, it's rare
enough for a small, unsubsidised fringe venue to strike out quite so
ambitiously; even more so that the trilogy in question is by a woman and
deals with issues of sexuality, love, and death from a woman's
perspective.
Pascal has been engaged on a personal odyssey for a number of years,
though it is only five years ago -- in the spring of 1990 -- that
Theresa, the first play in what has turned into a trilogy received its
first showing at a small synagogue in north London.
It is the still barely acknowledged story of Viennese Jew, Theresa
Steiner, her betrayal, and deportation from the isle of Guernsey and
subsequent death in Auschwitz (Pascal's research and subsequent play in
fact pre-empted the news story it became in the papers by a year). It
was quickly followed by A Dead Woman on Holiday, a love story set
against a backdrop of the Nuremberg trials. Three years ago Pascal's own
version of The Dybbuk (which also received its first showing at the same
theatre, the New End, where the present trilogy is now being staged)
completed the trio.
''Certainly,'' says Pascal, ''I never intended them to be a trilogy.
Each one was written independently and probably with a different emotion
uppermost -- anger, love, grief. Only now that they have all been put
together can I see that there is a circle round them, a kind of logic
which starts at that piece of land just off the coast of France, goes to
Nuremberg where the race laws against the Jews first started, and
finishes in The Dybbuk and the ghetto I've created in a space in my own
head.''
With typically British establishment indifference, all three plays
have received greater recognition and toured extensively in Europe --
some to surprising and what must have been painfully resonant places
like Germany's Breitenau concentration camp. When they have been seen
here -- as Glasgow audiences themselves will know from The Dybbuk's
visit to The Tron last year -- the plays have struck deep chords, not
just because of the subject matter but also because of the dramatic and
highly physical style Pascal has evolved to express them involving
dance, music, and movement.
Pascal, whose Jewish grandparents came from Romania, acknowledges
that, in retrospect, writing the plays has been least a form of
catharsis.
''My post-war generation was deeply affected by the Holocaust, by the
massive loss and grieving and the damage that was transmitted on. We
carry those ghosts within us -- not a day goes by when I don't think
about the Holocaust -- and unless we exorcise those ghosts I don't
believe we can begin to live -- or love -- properly.''
She is also keen that the plays should resonate for what she calls
''other communities who've undergone deracination like the Irish and the
blacks''.
Pascal's odyssey has, happily, had its lighter side. Last year she
married Alain Carpentier, the former socialist mayor of Maubeuge, in
north-eastern France and now divides her time between there and her flat
in London. Next year Theresa is to be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 as a
radio play and there are new adaptations for the stage of Charlotte
Bronte's Villette and a one-woman show about St Joan ready for
rehearsal. The ghosts are bringing forth some heady fruit.
*The Holocaust Trilogy, directed by Julia Pascal and New End director
Jon Harris, runs at the New End in Hampstead from November 14 to
December 10.

WHO would you pick to support the main man? How about a soaring voice,
backed by lifting melodies? That's Boo Hewardine folks, conjuring from a
guitar and light percussion the atmospheres which the Blue Nile (whom
God preserve) use a bank of computers to generate.
Loudon Wainwright III brings with him a new album, Grown Man: ''Number
15 in a series of whining, bitching, and moaning about my cheeseball
life.''
So, we hear about the agonies of eating out alone, a life mapped out
in hospital visits, and advice to a new lover, ''You have a grown man
for a boyfriend, but treat him like a baby''.
If that doesn't sound like fun, remember it comes from a man whose
sense of the absurd is as legendary as his disregard for the feelings of
the faint-hearted.
The feelings of his nearest and dearest are revealed in a ''duet'',
written for his daughter Martha, and stemming from a furious row in
which she accused him of sentimentalising his relationships in song,
while never actually being there when needed.
Singing both parts (naturally) Loudon provides the answer: ''Daughter
can't you see, the guy singing the songs ain't me.''
I guess that means the bozo standing on one leg and compulsively
sticking out his tongue is the same as the man regretfully picking out
the sad chords for I'd Rather Be Dreaming and both are playing a role.
Not so much Loudon's autobiography as the saga of everybody's cheeseball
life.

TWENTY-FIVE years they took to get here and we got a sound early on
that was akin to listening to a neighbour's transistor radio. ''Turn up
the vocals,'' requested a vociferous circle. They might well have added
several other items (bass guitar anyone?). The vocals eventually became
clearer, but for large segments of the set we were left with the
distinct impression that there was a great gig happening on stage.
The tightness and sheer expertise, if not the subtleties, carried
through. The sodden, swampy rhythm of Rock 'n' Roll Doctor was a joy.
Latest arrival Shaun Murphy's skill at the two-step was there for all to
see on a steamy Cajun Girls and the splendid elasticity of her
gospel-rooted rhythm &amp; blues hollerin' cut through on a deliberate
Cadillac Hotel.
Apart from consummate musicianship, Little Feat's trump card has
always been their ability to assimilate dashed near all the musical
styles that have come out of America. So we had Paul Barrere and Fred
Tackett duetting on Down On The Farm like a couple of souped-up,
acoustic guitar-toting hillbillies, and the latter later switching to
trumpet to take Dixie Chicken right back to New Orleans on a tailgate.
Their song structures may be sophisticated but they can play with the
unstoppable verve of a roadhouse band as the intricate but thundering
Texas Twister confirmed. Songs for departed friends, founder Lowell
George and cover artist Neon Park (Sailing Shoes and Borderline Blues
spanning virtually the band's whole career), showed the strength of a
continuing tradition.
They're still a great band but it would be nice to hear them properly,
and without waiting another 25 years.

DAVE GROHL has taken a considerable risk stepping out to front his own
band and launching it so soon after the demise of Nirvana. As a result,
his onstage demeanour is committed and energetic, but riddled with
self-doubt. ''Watch how bad my guitar solo on this is,'' he mumbles,
introducing Oh George. Throughout, Grohl seems genuinely surprised at
the enthusiasm with which the material -- almost all from their
self-titled debut album -- is received.
What is much harder to tell, especially given the huge number of
Nirvana T-shirts sported by the young audience, was whether this was a
genuine response or one tempered by a reverence for all things to do
with his former band. Unfortunately for Grohl and Krist Novoselic, it is
something that will shadow them whatever they do.
The reality is that, like the album, Foo Fighters' show is an uneven
and mainly uninspiring affair. The hit single This Is A Call is lost
early in the set to sound problems. Elsewhere, it is mainly formulaic
grunge, although Watershed hints at a play to a metal audience, and For
All The Cows has the requisite slow bits before exploding into an
all-out guitar attack.
The few triumphs come when Grohl bucks expectations. Big Me has a
classic, REM kind of melodicism, and I'll Stick Around is plainly a
great song. The encore, Floaty, introduced some belated texture into the
proceedings, suggesting that Foo Fighters may yet become a force in
their own right. However, even Nirvana diehards would have to ask
whether Novoselic's dignified silence is not more resonant than Grohl's
uninspiring public outings.

THE WRITER and broadcaster Bel Mooney says she remembers that
desperate need to talk ''as vividly as if it were yesterday,'' recalling
her second son, Tom, stillborn at full term, 20 years ago this autumn.
From now on, anyone affected by the death of a child, anywhere in the
UK, will be able to dial a freephone number and talk to a trained parent
volunteer who has been through the same experience and understands the
desperate nature of that need to talk. The helpline brings together work
started in Liverpool and carried on at Great Ormond Street Hospital in
London but taken up by many children's hospitals where staff feel a need
to help newly and often suddenly-bereft parents.
The helpline is available not only for parents, but for anyone
affected by the death of a child. There is a recognition, too, that the
death of a child in young adulthood is no less devastating.
Every year 12,000 children under the age of 19 die, in contradiction
of the very essence of family life that a child will outlive its
parents. It is that unfair ravaging of the natural order which makes the
experience so difficult to live with and the support of others who have
suffered the same blow so valuable.
Aware that bereaved parents often found greatest help from others who
had suffered the same loss, James Falconer, chaplain to Aberdeen
Hospitals, has set up a Children's Sudden Death Family Support Group in
the city.
He said: ''We offer help today with the immediate loss and the need to
arrange a funeral, but we can also deal with questions parents can be
reluctant to ask: can they hold their child, take a photograph, keep
their clothes, but we also help with tomorrow by putting them in touch
with a contact group.'' He welcomes the helpline's ability to introduce
people to local groups, but believes that it will offer a valuable
service to people who would prefer a more distant, possibly even
anonymous, contact.
A childhood death, especially if the result of accident or illness, is
often very public, involving friends, teachers, neighbours and indeed
communities. By contrast, stillbirths, and to an even greater degree
miscarriages, are private griefs which leave relatives and friends,
however sympathetic, lost for words to mourn a being they never knew.
Four years ago two grieving women were introduced by a mutual friend
who felt they could do more for each other than she could do for either,
and the Society for Counselling and Information on Miscarriage was born.
Their experiences were not identical but Anna Tod and Sandra Zappia
both felt an enormous sense of relief just for having talked to each
other and knowing they were not alone. As a result they set up a support
group based in Govanhill Health Centre but it soon became clear there
was a great unmet need for a counselling service.
They began raising funds from raffles and dances, gradually involving
more friends and relations. As the support groups grew and more people
who had suffered a miscarriage became involved as volunteers, they were
able to offer a telephone helpline plus counselling sessions, despite
their shoestring budgets.
A year ago they received #7000 funding from the Scottish Office to
cover their administrative costs which allowed them to set up an office
in Glasgow where Anna Tod now works full-time for a token salary. Sandra
is one of 25 volunteers who have all suffered miscarriages, 18 of whom
are counsellors after having gone through an intensive training course.
The first service of dedication and remembrance for all babies lost
through miscarriage will be held in Glasgow on Sunday, November 19, at
3pm. It will take place in St Andrew's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Clyde
Street, but will be ecumenical and include representatives from other
denominations and other religions.
Silversmithing students at Glasgow College of Art are designing and
making a special candleholder as part of their final year project and
the winning one chosen by SCIM will be used at the service.
About 2500 miscarriages are recorded every year in Scotland, but there
will be more which do not happen in hospital and therefore go
unrecorded. SCIM's latest figures show that fewer than one-third of
those women get in touch, yet in the past year they offered 1000
counselling sessions with 750 women. They also lecture to student
doctors and nurses and to organisations such as CRUSE on the effects of
miscarriage.
''It is talked about a bit more than it used to be, but there is still
the attitude that parents don't want to talk about it and that you can
go home, try again, and have a baby nine months later,'' said Anna Tod,
who had three miscarriages and had to face a hysterectomy.
''People are very anxious about miscarrying again and one of the
things we do is run a support group for subsequent pregnancies with
pre-conceptual advice. Statistically, people who have had one
miscarriage are no more likely than anyone else to miscarry again, but
we have had people with five or six, but no-one can predict who they
will be.'' she added.
SCIM offers a befriending service as well as counselling and tries to
match people's circumstances, pairing people who have had late or serial
miscarriages. Gradually it is extending its network of befrienders and
expects soon to begin counselling sessions in other towns and cities,
but the telephone service is always available to anyone from any part of
Scotland.
* SCIM, 12 Renfield Street, Glasgow G2 5AL, 0141 221 1586.
* The National Child Death Helpline, Freephone 0800 282 986, every

JUST about this time last year, during the National Review of Live Art
in Glasgow, I stood and listened as, for hour after hour, voices told of
untold guilts and trespasses, as if confessing to some cosmic
responsibility for everything. This was the experimental beginning of
Speak Bitterness which Forced Entertainment brought to the Assembly
Rooms last week. The piece is now much shorter than the five-hour
odyssey of the NRLA but it has lost none of the harrowing power it
generated so compellingly then.
Seven individuals, in brisk clothing -- black dress, grey suit, white
shirt -- gather behind a long table snowed under with typed sheets of
paper. Like seven deadly sins at a board meeting -- or perhaps
rehearsing for the summons to spill all for Oprah -- they read out
admissions of mutual guilt. Never I, always we -- because in these
dodging times, passivity is tantamount to collusion.
The litany wriggles and strides -- brilliantly, as if in random
spontaneity -- across the dividing lines between atrocity and bad taste,
arrogant amorality and gawky embarrassment, without discriminating or
issuing judgments. It's like hearing a jigsaw being pieced together.
The text resonates with poetic cadences just as the performances shift
through all manner of subtle moods and interplays -- Speak Bitterness is
at times hilarious in its inspired triviality but is ultimately
heart-rending in its depiction of a society where ''we were never who or
what we said we were''. Line after line, the ring of truth is what
discomfits us. A performance that shows that, despite a winter of
attrition by the Arts Council of England, Forced Entertainment is going
from strength to perceptive strength.

SCOTTISH Ballet has named the successor to Mr Peter Kyle, who left the
company abruptly at the end of April this year.
He is Mr David Williams, who comes to Scotland from the post of
administration and personnel manager at English National Ballet. He is
appointed general manager, the company having made it clear on Mr Kyle's
departure that his post of chief executive would not be filled.
Ms Galina Samsova, the company's artistic director, said: ''David is
going to be a valuable member of the team here at Scottish Ballet and I
am looking forward to what I'm sure will be a successful working
partnership.''
Mr Williams will take up his post in Glasgow at the beginning of next
month. He is married with two children, and previously was general
manager of the Theatre Royal Stratford East and theatre manager at the
Cambridge Arts Theatre.
The chairman of Scottish Ballet, Mrs Oona Ivory, said: ''Scottish
Ballet is a company committed to excellence and I believe David's
experience can help us continue to build on recent financial and
critical successes.''
Mr Williams joins at a difficult time. Mr Kyle's resignation came
after disagreement with Ms Samsova over the direction of the company and
a number of pessimistic reports to the board about the financial health
of the organisation.
His appointment also raises questions about the future of company
administrator Chris Denny, who was appointed by Mr Kyle and has looked
after the day-to-day administration since his resignation. Mr Denny is
believed to have applied for the job of general manager.

AN MP plans to gatecrash a Scottish Office Minister's visit to the
fishery research vessel Culpea at Ardrossan harbour today. Labour's
George Foulkes yesterday accused the Scottish Office Environment
Minister, the Earl of Lindsay, of failing to respond to his request to
be included in the party accompanying the Minister on his visit to the
ship.
Culpea is about to start a survey of the area around Beaufort's Dyke
in the North Channel between Scotland and Northern Ireland, from which
it is thought more than 4000 incendiary devices have drifted ashore in
recent weeks.
Mr Foulkes (Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley) said: ''I wrote about
10 days ago to the earl, saying I understood Culpea was going out in
mid-November for the start of the probe into the Beaufort's Dyke area.
''I said, since I had been in the forefront of raising this issue, I
would like to join them.
''Last week, Lord Lindsay was in Canada -- but his office said there
is no way I can go on the vessel.
''I had asked politely if I could join him so that I could see the
work that will be going on, and we could talk about it on the way out.''
The MP continued: ''This is a tremendous snub to an elected Member who
has been involved in the campaign over the danger from dumped arms from
the beginning, and also a major 'own goal' by Lord Lindsay.
''I think anyone like Michael Forsyth or Raymond Robertson would have
seen the advantage of taking the main critic along and illustrating what
a good job is being done.''
The MP said he understands that Culpea's maximum load is only 18
people. When she puts to sea today for a short test of her equipment,
that number will be made up by 11 crew, three scientists, one TV
cameraman and one still cameraman, with the last two places going to
Lord Lindsay and his press officer.
The MP, who has an adjournment debate in the Commons on Wednesday on
the issue of armaments dumped in the North Channel, added: ''If he is
determined that I am not going, I can only assume that he has something
to hide.
''However, I intend to be there on the quayside at Ardrossan when the
Minister arrives.''

A #500m plan to instal central-heating systems in 80,000 council
houses will be launched in Glasgow today.
It will take seven years to complete and is intended to alleviate the
health problems associated with poorly heated homes.
Glasgow has one of the worst records in Europe for respiratory
problems, heart disease, and cancer.
Council leader Pat Lally explained: ''Housing and health go hand in
hand and for that reason we think it is absolutely imperative that every
house in Glasgow has an efficient central- heating system.
''It will result in a vast improvement to tenants' quality of life.''
Mr Lally added that the council was already committed to getting rid of
chronic dampness and fuel poverty.
The city is seeking a European partner to help instal and maintain the
heating scheme over the next 20 years.
More than 200 delegates representing major European and UK business
interests will gather in the City Chambers today to hear the council's
proposals, backed by Scottish Housing Minister Raymond Robertson.
The most recent housing survey of Glasgow found that the city had more
damp homes and fewer centrally heated houses than any other part of
Scotland.
According to Energy Action Scotland, the combination of dampness,
cold, and poverty contributed to 3000 deaths a year.

COMPANY executives are receiving six-figure redundancy pay-offs as
thousands of workers face life on the dole with no cash safety net,
according to Labour research published yesterday.
Shadow Employment Minister Ian McCartney branded the ''hypocrisy and
double standards'' of top companies over redundancy payments ''a
national disgrace''. Figures compiled by the Labour Research Department
highlighted 47 directors who received more than #100,000 each in
payments totalling #18.7m.
Thirteen directors left work with #500,000 or more -- including two
who took more than #1m -- and put the average executive pay-off at
#398,000.
The analysis showed top managers were 65 times more likely to be
offered redundancy packages than the average worker across industry.
People in unskilled jobs, clerical posts, and part-time workers were,
in contrast, less likely than average to be given pay-offs.
Mr McCartney said: ''Typically of Tory Britain, even in redundancy
there is boom in the boardroom and bust for the workforce.
''These figures show that while job insecurity causes millions of
people to live in fear of the future, for top directors redundancy often
proves more lucrative than keeping their job.
''The double standards being practised in redundancy are a national
disgrace.''
The two executives identified by the research as receiving more than
#1m were Mr William Buckley, who is said to have left Royal Insurance
with #1.87m, and Mr Peter Davis, who was allegedly paid #1.25mby Reed
International.

<HEADLINE>Lawyer takes up tenants' case after engineer's report blames faulty drainage system. Flood victims set to sue council</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A REPORT into the cause of severe flooding in Glasgow last year has
pinned the blame on a faulty drainage system, prompting residents to
seek #120,000 damages from Strathclyde Regional Council.
Thousands of pounds of damage was caused by flooding in Blackstone
Crescent, Pollok, last December. Now 24 residents are to sue the local
authority for damages if compensation claims are turned down.
The claim against the council has been lodged following publication of
a Strathclyde University engineer's report which backs up long-standing
assertions that the flooding was caused by the failure of the drainage
system to cope with heavy rainfall.
The lawyer acting for the tenants, Mr Cameron Fyfe, said: ''The
conclusions of this report clearly point the finger of blame at the
regional council, who are responsible for the drainage system. Despite
the heavy rainfall, if properly designed and maintained it should have
coped with the excess water. It clearly didn't.
''As a result of the failure of the system, my clients' homes were
flooded to a depth of 21 inches and thousands of pounds of damage was
caused to their furnishings and belongings.
''We are simply asking the regional council to accept responsibility
for this and pay them compensation accordingly. If they do not do so, I
have been instructed to raise court proceedings for the recovery of what
has been lost and compensation for the suffering and misery the flooding
has caused.''
He said many of the residents making claims had been flooded out of
their homes three times in the last 10 years.
The report, by chartered civil engineer John Riddell, was commissioned
by the tenants' lawyers to back up their case. It said: ''Action should
have been taken to reduce the risk substantially.'' The report said
properly-designed drains should have been able to cope with the heavy
rainfall.
Glasgow Pollok MP James Dunnachie backed the campaign for compensation
and said the failure to prevent flooding was a disgrace.
He added: ''I hope some sense is shown in this case. They should be
properly reimbursed for any damages. I would be happy if they took the
case to court.''
He said the area was badly affected by flooding because it lay in a
hollow and the drains were easily blocked by silt and debris.Mr
Dunnachie said local authorities and the Scottish Office had failed to
tackle the problem by not taking responsibility.
He added: ''It is demoralising for anyone living in the area to know
that, if there's a downpour, their homes could be flooded.
''This has been happening for a long time and something should be done
about it. Everyone in the area knows that the drains cannot hold water
after heavy rain. I don't care who they get the money from but it should
be made available to make the area habitable.
''The Scottish Office holds the purse strings but they know a proper
remedy would cost millions of pounds.''
A spokesman for Strathclyde Regional Council said: ''There are several
outstanding claims from December 1994 and the region is considering each
on its merits.
''If we can't reach agreement on a claim it is always open to the
claimant to go for court action. If that is the case I cannot comment
further.''

AN attempt is to be made to double the value of activity holidays to
Grampian's economy to #40m within four years.
Grampian has one of the most concentrated range of such holidays on
offer in Britain. In future, they will be available in a variety of
packages in a sector in which packages have not been traditional.
Grampian Enterprise has joined forces with the private sector for the
marketing operation.
Concerns about safety standards and qualifications of instructors have
been addressed by a kite-marking system. This will enable prospective
visitors to ensure that they are being properly supervised.
The kite mark, the first to be applied to activity centres in the UK,
will be awarded to establishments which meet training, management, and
service criteria. These centres will be marketed through a new company,
Activities Holidays Scotland, which will provide accommodation,
transport, insurance, and the activity itself in one package which will
be outlined in brochures which will be published next month.
Mr Paul Johnson, managing director of Activities Holidays Scotland, a
sister company of an English activity holiday operator, said: ''Our
experience has shown that customers are looking for reassurance.
''They want to know that they are going to be safe. They want to know
that they can cope with the activity, that they will be cared for, and
will have a truly memorable time.''
To be awarded a kite mark, those providing the activities will have to
undergo training and assessment under the national vocation awards
scheme, with particular emphasis on management. They will be required to
provide evidence of good training and skills-monitoring practices.
They must also put forward certification to prove that their
instructors are qualified for the activities offered.
Where no qualification exists for an activity, new ones will be
evolved under the vocational awards scheme.
Details of companies involved and the instructors' qualifications will
be held on a skills register, held by an independent trustee, to prevent
abuse.
Mr Mike Fleming, director of business development for Grampian
Enterprise, said: ''There are around 60 activity holiday companies
around the area. They are small but in a market that is growing quite
steadily.
''There is a trend for people to want activity holidays.''
He said Grampian Enterprise had been working on the project for the
past 18 months with the private sector.
''At the moment, it is a market worth about #20m a year to the
Grampian economy. We want to see that double by the end of the century
when we will have a national class cluster of activity,'' he said.
The kite-mark initiative is a response to concerns about activity
holidays arising in part from the deaths of four children in the Lyme
Bay canoeing tragedy in 1993.
New legislation comes into force in April which involves inspection
and licensing. It has been criticised as being inadequate.
Grampian Enterprise says it has gone further than the legislation to
ensure that people are confident of the safety of anyone participating
in the holidays.
''Grampian is leading the way and is going to be the first to have it
in place,'' Mr Fleming said.
''Three-quarters of the existing visitors come from the South of
Scotland and the North of England and we want to broaden that to the
South of England and beyond.''
In addition to the UK, the packages are going to be available to
customers in Norway, Germany, and Holland.
The project is being watched keenly as a potential role model for
other geographic areas in an expanding market.

SEAL champion Fiona Middleton is trying to force the enactment of

She says a secret letter from the Scottish Office indicates official

in Orkney on October 26.
Ms Middleton -- famous for her caring for seals on Islay -- wants the
fish boycott to last until seal culling is outlawed by Parliament.
She has uncovered a March, 1993, letter from the Scottish Office's
Agriculture and Fisheries Department to Orkney Fisheries Association
which she says gives fish farmers the nod to shoot seals which they say
threaten their livelihoods.
One paragraph of the letter reads: ''The most effective way to deal
with rogue seals is already provided for in the Conservation of Seals
Act. It is to take action directly against the seals concerned.
''Under the Act, a fisherman may shoot seals attacking his creels
during both the open and close seasons. We ask people in their own
interests to be discreet about any such shooting.''
Ms Middleton said: ''If that is not condoning the slaughter of seals I
don't know what is.''
On October 26, a woman out walking on South Ronaldsay discovered 25
seal pups shot through the head on a beach.
Ms Middleton said: ''We are asking ordinary people to show their
horror by attacking the fishermen in their wallets. I would like
everyone to ban fish of every type from their homes until the seals are
protected by severe and stringent laws.''
Ms Middleton, 36, became internationally known for playing the violin
to the seals and swimming with them in a bay near her home on Islay.
The Scottish Office said it could not comment on the contents of the
letter but said its position had not changed since it was written.

FORD'S annual wage negotiations, which reach a critical stage this
week, may have a major impact on other negotiations, according to
Incomes Data Services.
An IDS survey of company attitudes suggests that 8 out of 10 firms
take other settlements into account when making pay decisions. Ford is
the company deemed most influential.
''The Retail Price Index and the 'going rate' remain the most powerful
external factors in determining settlement levels,'' IDS says.
IDS points out that getting the ''benchmark'' comparisons right at a
time of low inflation and a tightening labour market is especially
important.
The erosion of established pay benchmarks and the emphasis on
competitiveness have led companies to focus more on larger firms for
comparisons. IDS maintain this ''must inevitably push up the going
rate''.
Ford has offered its workers a 3% increase in reply to a 10% claim but
has refused to budge on hours which the unions want reduced from 39 to
37 a week. Vauxhall's 9000 manual employees are already balloting on
industrial action in protest at a similar offer.
Rover, Ford's Jaguar subsidiary, Rolls-Royce Motors, and Honda already
operate a 37-hour week as does most of the engineering industry. Nissan
and Toyota say they will match Ford and Vauxhall.

<TEXT>
TORY MP Patrick Nicholls last night looked set to become the first
target for investigation by the new independent parliamentary watchdog
as another ''sleaze'' row exploded at Westminster.
The former Minister was being referred by Labour to the parliamentary
commissioner for standards over an alleged ''shares for influence''
business deal.
Mr Nicholls, 46, insisted he broke no rules in offering to use his
position to open doors in Whitehall for a West Country water equipment
firm.
Labour accused him of exploiting a grey area under old rules -- swept
away in the wake of the Nolan Inquiry into MPs' behaviour -- and said he
would fall foul of new guidelines agreed last week.
The dispute centred on a business arrangement with World Water
Services Ltd in which Mr Nicholls agreed to use his influence to promote
the company -- and attempt to win it a lucrative Government contract --
in return for an eventual 5% shareholding.
The link was recorded correctly in the Commons Register of Members'
Interests and Mr Nicholls was adamant that he followed both ''the spirit
and the letter'' of parliamentary rules.
However, the Government, already under fire for its attempt to block
moves to force MPs to reveal outside earnings connected to parliamentary
work, effectively washed its hands of the Teignbridge MP.
Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine told BBC TV's Breakfast with
Frost programme: ''I have no detailed knowledge of this issue, except
what I have read in the papers, but there is now a parliamentary
commissioner who can examine these matters.
''That is one advantage of having this procedure; there is an easy way
to deal with these things.''
Mr Nicholls said he stood to benefit financially from the link -- and
would have declared that he held a paid interest -- but was adamant that
he received no money from the company.
In the Commons last week, advocacy by MPs for any outside interest was
banned in a crackdown on business links.
During the debate on the Nolan proposals, Mr Nicholls attacked the
appointment of the new commissioner as ''bizarre'' and accused
colleagues of over-reacting.
''We got into this position . . . because two stupid, silly, greedy
Members did something that most of us would never do,'' he said.
He was yesterday unrepentant about the comments, and claimed simply to
have acted in the legitimate best interests of a highly promising firm.
''This was a company well worth while promoting from a West Country
point of view and from a national point of view,'' he said.
''I received no money. I had an unpaid interest and that is what I
registered. If I had ever received a financial interest I would have
registered that. That is in accordance with the rules of the House, both
the spirit and the letter.''
Mr Nicholls agreed to promote a water-purifying system on behalf of
WWS, which it was claimed could cut water bills by up to 80%.
Correspondence passed to the media showed that in April this year he
was offered a 5% shareholding in WWS.
Mr Nicholls wrote back: ''All things being equal, it would be entirely
logical that I should become a director and receive a 5% shareholding.''
Deputy Labour leader John Prescott claimed the deal was every bit as
bad as the ''cash-for-questions'' row that sparked the Nolan inquiry.
He said: ''These letters appear to show that Mr Nicholls sought and
later struck a deal in which he was to be rewarded with share options
for his influence and contacts. That is completely unacceptable and
offensive to Parliament and to standards in public life.''
The new parliamentary commissioner, Sir Gordon Downey, takes up his
#70,000-a-year post when Parliament returns for the new session on
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
CONVICTED killer Michael Sams, who murdered prostitute Julie Dart and
kidnapped property consultant Stephanie Slater, also killed estate agent
Suzy Lamplugh, according to a book published today.
Mr Christopher Berry-Dee used 30,000 case papers and an interview with
Sams as evidence for his conclusion that Sams abducted Ms Lamplugh,
whose disappearance nine years ago remains a mystery.
His book is titled Unmasking Mr Kipper -- after the name used by the
man whom 25-year-old Ms Lamplugh was meeting the day she vanished in
July 1986, in Fulham, west London.
His conclusion is based on correspondence with Sams, an interview in
which Sams ''strongly hinted at kidnapping and murdering Suzy
Lamplugh'', interviews with Sams' ex-wife, Teena, who says he confessed
to her, and letters from Sams to his wife and friends.
Ms Lamplugh's mother, Diana, dismissed the book, saying: ''This is a
misuse and abuse of Suzy for publicity but there is nothing we can do
because she belongs to the public. She does not belong to us any more.''
In February, based on evidence supplied by Mr Berry-Dee, police dug up
the garden and searched a well at a home in Peterborough which Sams used
to own. Nothing was found. Scotland Yard said last night: ''We would
consider any new evidence which came to light but there is no evidence,
nor has there ever been any evidence, to connect Michael Sams and Suzy
Lamplugh.''

ACTING Prime Minister Shimon Peres promised yesterday to follow slain
leader Yitzhak Rabin's path to peace but assailed the ''devil's
disciples'' in Israel he said stood in the way.
Speaking at an memorial ceremony of his ruling Labour party, Peres,
politicians and Rabin's family voiced bitterness and sorrow over the
killing of the 73-year-old prime minister by a Jewish gunman at a peace
rally on November 4.
Peres, 72, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Rabin and PLO head
Yasser Arafat in 1994, said Israel had no choice but to ''continue to
pave (the way of peace) so that the children who cried on his grave will
not have to shed a tear in the future''.
But Peres warned the crowd of 3000, including ambassadors from the
United States, Egypt and Jordan, that there were ''a lot of people on
the edge of insanity who think they are God's messengers.
''In fact they are the devil's disciples.''
Police have arrested seven people, including confessed killer Yigal
Amir, in connection with the murder. All are religious Jews. Amir said
he acted alone ''but maybe with God''.
One of about a dozen people speakers at a stage covered in red
carnations at the Tel Aviv Cultural Centre, Rabin's former aide Shimon
Sheves criticised the killer and the opposition headed by Likud party
leader Benjamin Netanyahu.
''There was among us in our country one who made the blood of Yitzhak
cheap, and there was one who didn't stop those who cheapened his blood,
and there were all those who were supportive but remained silent,''
Sheves said.
After the killing, Rabin's widow Leah told reporters that Netanyahu,
who spoke at right-wing rallies where hundreds called Rabin a traitor,
shared the blame for the violent climate in which the assassination took
place.
''I am still looking back and I still haven't forgotten the awful
words of incitement said about him and against him, the cries of
'traitor' and 'murderer' that were hurled at him. And even if he didn't
show and express how much they hurt him, I know how much they hurt
him,'' She said.

SERBS abandoned a four-year separatist revolt in Croatia yesterday,
signing an accord to hand over the strategic Eastern Slavonia region and
lifting the threat of fighting that could have wrecked peace hopes in
the Balkans.
''This is the beginning of the end of the wars in former Yugoslavia. I
believe it will have a contagious effect leading to an overall peace in
former Yugoslavia,'' UN mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg told reporters in
Zagreb.
Crafted at the Balkan summit in Dayton, Ohio, the 14-point agreement
envisages restoration of Croatian control over Eastern Slavonia after a
transitional period of one year under international military authority.
The accord ends a Serb rebellion that erupted in war when Croatia
broke away from former Yugoslavia in 1991. Almost 100,000 Croat
inhabitants driven out of the Eastern Slavonia region in the fighting
would be able to return, while Serbs who lived there when the war
erupted could retain their homes.
The Croatian army recaptured two other rebel Serb enclaves earlier
this year and President Franjo Tudjman had threatened to use force in
East Slavonia if peace efforts did not work by the end of November.
Zagreb alarmed the UN last week by openly reinforcing its troops in
the region, which borders Serbian-led rump Yugoslavia and was regarded
as a potentially dangerous flashpoint for a renewed war between Croats
and Serbs.
Eastern Slavonia is prized territory with its fertile plains and oil
wells.
Hrvoje Sarinic, Tudjman's top aide, returned overnight from the summit
in the US to sign the accord along with Stoltenberg and fellow
international mediator, US Ambassador Peter Galbraith.
Stoltenberg and Galbraith had taken the agreement a few hours earlier
to the rebel-held town of Erdut where it was quickly signed by local
Serb leader Milan Milanovic.
''This is an historic occasion. For the first time since war began in
former Yugoslavia in 1991, one of the main issues in contention has been
settled peacefully, with signatures instead of bullets,'' Galbraith told
reporters.
The agreement said a UN Security Council resolution would establish an
''international force'' in the region to guarantee human rights for
Croats, Serbs and smaller minorities and deter violent score settling
over the events of 1991.
It did not say whether the international authority would be under UN
or NATO command. The Serbs insisted earlier on UN authority while the
Croats demanded a NATO operation. Sarinic said this issue had yet to be
resolved.
The English text of the agreement released in Zagreb calls for a
one-year transition to Croatian rule with the option of a further year
if requested by one party.
The area would be fully demilitarised within 30 days of international
peacekeepers arriving and temporary local police under their authority
being deployed.
Minority Serbs armed and steered by Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic rebelled and seized 30 percent of Croatia when it declared
independence from Yugoslavia in mid-1991. Eastern Slavonia saw the
bloodiest fighting in Europe since World War Two.
The Serbs' demolition of the city of Vukovar in a marathon siege,
followed by the exodus of Croats at gunpoint and the suspected massacre
of 260 Croat hospital patients, seared the new nation of Croatia and
Tudjman vowed to avenge it.
A truce, brokered by the UN ended the 1991 war after six months but
the Serbs exploited the freezing of front lines to establish a breakaway
state from which 250,000 Croats were expelled.
* President Bill Clinton yesterday hailed the agreement saying it was
a ''major step'' towards an overall peace in the Balkans.
''I congratulate the parties for the wisdom they have shown in
entering into this agreement and avoiding renewed conflict,'' Clinton
said in a statement released by the White House.--REUTER.

Kathmandu
A TEENAGE boy given up for dead in an avalanche survived a 24-hour
ordeal and was pulled from deep snow today, safe except for frostbite,
Nepali rescue officials said.
The rescue of 17-year-old Deepak Nepali against all the odds made the
death toll in weekend avalanches in the Himalayan kingdom 42.
A total of 17 foreigners are known to have died -- 13 Japanese
trekkers killed by Saturday's avalanche and an Irish woman, two
Canadians and a German buried in a landslide.
Rescuers on Sunday helped some 115 foreign trekkers from a
snow-ravaged valley near Mount Everest.
''Some of the rescued were in shoulder-deep snow,'' said Bikash J.B.
Rana, a Nepal Airways helicopter pilot who took part.
''Most are suffering from snow blindness, frostbite and hunger,'' Rana
said. ''Many of them would have died had rescuers not reached them
today.''
The avalanche in which the 13 Japanese died on Saturday was also
believed to have killed 13 Nepalis. But Deepak managed to survive by
perching between two rocks in four-foot deep snow, rescue officials
said.
The Japanese, their Sherpa guides and porters were buried in the snow
as they slept in a camp at Pangka, some 170 miles northeast of Kathmandu
about 1am on Saturday.
The Japanese were trekking their way to the Gokyo Valley, the popular
hiking area 12 miles southwest of Everest.
Another 17 people were killed when landslides caused by continuous
rains crushed houses and trekkers' lodges in Manang and Panchathar
districts.
Of the four foreigners who died in the Manang district in mid-western
Nepal, two were Canadians, one German and an Irish women named only as
Mary Josephine, the Home (Interior) Ministry said.
Tourism officials said there could be up to 500 foreigners in the
Everest region. More trekkers may have been stranded in Taplejung
district, to the east of Everest.
Rescuers armed with special digging equipment rushed to a remote
region near the 29,028-foot peak.
The bodies of five Japanese and three Nepalis were pulled out, but
rescue work was hampered by diffficult conditions.
Food packets, medicines and clothes were dropped from helicopters in
the Gokyo Valley area.
Saturday's avalanche was the worst disaster to strike a trekking or
mountaineering expedition in Nepal, whose towering peaks and pristine
valleys attract about 65,000 foreign hikers and climbers each year.--

Washington,
IT is High Noon in Washington tomorrow, with the Democratic president
and the Republican Congress each determined to defeat and humiliate the
other in the most public way possible.
President Clinton will veto legislation necessary to allow the
government to continue, and its least important functions will be
suspended at midnight. He will also veto a bill that raises the limit on
the federal debt, and the possibility that the United States will
default will loom suddenly over the world's markets.
The president intends to use his veto because the two bills have been
decorated with a string of additional provisions, some ideological, some
matters of fundamental policy. Mr Clinton wants ''clean' bills, meaning
ones that have no such addenda, and proposes that the national and
political debate on all the other matters be left to the ordinary
process of writing the budget, which should be completed by Christmas.
The two Republican leaders, Senator Bob Dole and the speaker of the
House, Newt Gingrich, hinted today at a way out of the impasse. If the
president will concede that the budget must be balanced in seven years,
then all these extraneous matters are negotiable. True, that apparent
concession includes a demand that the president accept Congress's
figures on how much must be cut, but that might be dropped at the last
moment.
Promises are easy, and it is possible that after Mr Clinton has
demonstrated his mettle by exercising his veto and closing the
government, a compromise may be possible, with him promising to do his
best to balance the budget and the Republicans accepting the ''clean''
bills.
Then the debate would return to the more usual forum, the budget bills
now before Congress. However, Mr Clinton proposes to veto mostof them,
anyway, because he disagrees with the fundamental measures the
Republicans propose to balance the budget. So the conflict would be
merely postponed.
This is why the Republicans are pushing so hard now: they have weapons
to use, the debt ceiling and the fact that the government must live from
hand to mouth until the budget bills have been passed. The financial
year ended on September 30 and under law, the government should have
closed then.
Congress then voted a further six weeks supply, to use the British
term. Radicals in the House say that they will not vote any more, still
less extend the government's authority to borrow, unless Mr Clinton
accepts their recipes for reforming the government.
The secretary of the treasury, Robert Rubin, said on television that
there were methods for the government to find the money to pay its
obligations, at least for the next few weeks. It will borrow no more,
and will dip into the civil service trust funds to pay the huge interest
payments that fall due every fortnight, starting with $25 billion on
November 15.
He insisted that this was not the way to run the government and that
it could not be kept up very long. Standard &amp; Poor, the firm that rates
governments, suggested two days ago that the US rating, AAA, might have
to be lowered and Mr Rubin said that would be a disaster.

NATO ministers will step up their efforts this week to find a new
secretary-general after an embarrassing US-European row scuppered the
chances of the leading Dutch candidate and left the Alliance in
disarray.
Former Danish foreign minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen is to hold talks
in Paris today in an apparent last-ditch effort to win the support of
the French.
France had earlier made it clear it favoured former Dutch prime
minister Ruud Lubbers but, after Paris had rallied the support of both
Britain and Germany, the US vetoed him.
In another twist the Dutch government said it would not back Dutch
European commissioner Hans van den Broek for the job because it wants
him to stay with the EU.
European Nato defence and foreign ministers are to continue talks
during a Western European Union summit in Madrid on Tuesday.
Germany's Bild am Sontag newspaper reported today that EU External
Affairs Commissioner van den Broek had now emerged as a serious
candidate to replace Belgium's Willy Claes, who resigned on October 20
over a corruption scandal.
Bonn immediately issued a statement denying it was backing him and
diplomatic sources said van den Broek is not widely liked or respected.
But equally he is not disliked and is certainly acceptable to the
Americans.--Reuter.

HEAVILY-ARMED soldiers reinforced barricades on main arteries leading
into Algiers yesterday as campaigning moved into the final 24 hours
before the presidential poll that Muslim rebels have vowed to wreck.
Eyewitnesses said troops took over a school in Hammamet area, one mile
from the Muslim fundamentalist bastion of Bab El Oued in the capital.
More soldiers, armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles, manned a
roadblock nearby to check identities of bus passengers and motorists and
to search vehicles.
''My brother, an army officer, has had all leave cancelled because of
the mobilisation for the presidential election,'' said one young
resident of a district not far from Algiers airport.
Foot patrols of at least 10 armed soldiers were seen by residents on
Saturday in Rais Hamidou, near Ain Taya forest on the outskirts of
Algiers, and in other districts.
Next Thursday's presidential election is being boycotted by the main
legal opposition parties. Armed Muslim groups, who have battled the
authorities for the past four years, are committed to disrupting or
aborting the poll.
With a high voter turnout seen as crucial to the legitimacy of the
election, the authorities moved their battle to get Algerians to cast
their ballots into high gear at the weekend.
State-controlled television gave wide coverage to the start of voting
by Algerians abroad, such as in France and Belgium, in a clear nod
towards encouraging more than 15 million potential voters inside the
North African country.
Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi, who has appealed for a massive turnout,
said the poll was costing 5.5 billion dinars ($105 million).
The boycotting opposition says it is all a ploy by the authorities to
maintain their grip on power, spearheaded by President Liamine Zeroual.
Zeroual, seen as the favourite candidate, is being opposed at the
ballot box by Islamist Mahfoud Nahnah, anti-Islamist hawk Said Saadi,
and moderate Islamist intellectual Noureddine Boukrouh. All must wind up
their campaigns by Monday night.
The authorities see the poll as a first step towards ending the
four-year-old crisis in which an estimated 45,000 to 50,000 people have
been killed. Violence erupted when the army-backed authorities in
January 1992 cancelled the first multi-party general election in the
nation of 28 million people.
The Muslim fundamentalist party, the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS),
was poised for a landslide win in that election.
''Be aware that the act of voting constitutes an action for which you
will be held responsible before the Almighty,'' the outlawed FIS said in
a statement received in Paris last week.
Diplomats and Algerian political analysts say the authorities' aim of
getting a respectable voter turnout of around 60 percent may be
realistic.
A series of bombings and killings, blamed by the authorities on Muslim
rebels such as armed offshoots of the FIS like the Islamic Salvation
Army (AIS) and Armed Islamic Group (GIA), have bloodied the countdown to
the election.
On Saturday, a car bomb blew up outside a town hall in Ouled Yaich
area near the garrison town of Blida south of Algiers, killing five
people, the newspaper l'Opinion said on Sunday.
''It was aimed at discouraging citizens from collecting their voting
card,'' said a local official, quoted by the newspaper.
Draconian security measures have been taken to protect journalists
invited by the authorities to cover the election and observers from the
Organisation of African Unity (OAU), Arab League and United Nations, the
latter sending six for a poll in Africa's second largest
country.--Reuter.

CAPE CANAVERAL: The space shuttle Atlantis blasted through low-lying
clouds yesterday morning with five astronauts on board to begin an
eight-day mission aimed at docking with the Russian space station Mir.
Atlantis had only a narrow, 10-minute ''window'' to be launched, and
mission controllers were concerned about clouds offshore at Kennedy
Space Centre. Bad weather at the ship's three emergency launch sites
already had forced a one-day delay from Saturday's secheduled takeoff.

HERITAGE Secretary VirginiaBottomley yesterday defiedpressure to raise
the age limit on the National Lottery from 16 to 18.
She said the Government would not be forced into becoming a ''nanny''
-- and pointed out that teenagers were allowed to marry at 16.
The Government came under pressure to raise the age last week, when it
emerged that a 15-year-old boy, Clayton Beech, had won #10,000 in a
scratchcard game.
He told the shopkeeper he was 16 and went back to claim his winnings
with his mother.
Mrs Bottomley, appearing on GMTV's Sunday programme, dismissed fears
that young people could be drawn into gambling by playing the lottery.
''If there's any evidence that the National Lottery is causing adverse
effects, we'd certainly look at it. But, really, we had a conversation
this week about whether people under 18 shouldn't be allowed to play,''
she said.
''Well, you can marry at 16. I mean, there are all sorts of ways in
which people can spend their money unwisely. I don't think we can be
that much of a nanny.''
She added: ''I do think we should be very tough on people who do sell
tickets to under 16-year-olds and I'm pleased that the licence was
withdrawn from one operator who was selling to under-16s.''
Meanwhile, Labour has announced that it is setting up its own
fact-finding mission aimed at discovering better ways of running the
lottery.
Shadow Heritage Secretary Jack Cunningham said the advisory group,
holding its first meeting this week, also would recommend changes in the
way funds were distributed.
It would look at whether there was a need for a mid-week draw and the
minimum age at which young people should be allowed to buy tickets.
Five winning ticket-holders are set to join the ranks of the 100-plus
individual millionaires created by the lottery since its launch a year
ago, Camelot said yesterday.
The winning numbers at the weekend were: 23, 28, 48, 10, 7 and 30. The
bonus number was 3.
Each holder of one of the tickets with all six numbers correct will
collect #1,700,159 -- sharing the total jackpot payout of #8,500,795.
It was not known how many of the five jackpot tickets were bought by
individuals or syndicates.
However, before this weekend's draw, the total number of jackpot
winners was 127, of whom well over 100 were thought to be individual
ticket-holders picking up more than a million pounds, Camelot said.
* The lottery will be a year old tomorrow. Its launch exceeded all
Camelot's expectations. About #7m worth of tickets were snapped up in
the first 12 hours.
However, there has been plenty of controversy too.
Last December, one man picked up #17.8m but his hopes of anonymity
were dashed when his name was published in newspapers.
Complaints that charities were suffering badly as a result of the
lottery grew in March, when cancer charity Tenovus said it was closing
its monthly lottery game, which raised #1.5m a year. The National
Council for Voluntary Organisations estimated that donations to
charities had fallen by more than #70m since the lottery was launched.
March also saw the launch of instant-win scratchcards. By October, a
billion of the #1 tickets had been sold, amid warnings that punters were
becoming addicted.
Cash began to be distributed to good causes in March. However, there
was huge controversy in April when #12.5m of lottery money was handed to
the Churchill family to buy former Prime Minister Sir Winston
Churchill's papers. The handout was the first of many rows about the
amount of cash being directed to the ''rich'' in the arts world.
Minister in a flutter
MRS Bottomley revealed that she played the lottery as part of a family
syndicate masterminded by her MP husband Peter -- but had not yet won a
penny.
Asked if a jackpot win would see her resign and live in Bali, she
replied: ''I'm not entirely sure, I've got an awful lot of causes. Maybe
the Isle of Wight if not Bali.''
The Bottomleys are renowned for travelling no further than the Isle of
Wight for summer holidays.
What happens to #65m weekly gamble
CAMELOT has sold more than #3300m worth of lottery tickets and more
than #1100m worth of scratchcards.
Average weekly sales are around #65m.
More than #1200m has been given to the five Government-nominated good
causes -- the arts, heritage, sport, the Millennium Fund, and charities.
The Government has claimed #530m in tax, retailers have earned #225m
in commission, and Camelot has made #275m in operating costs and profit.
More than #1530m has been paid out in lottery prizes and more than
#620m in Instants prizes.
Nine in 10 adults have played the on-line game. One in two have played
Instants. Two in three people -- 30 million -- play the lottery
regularly.
The highest single jackpot ticket won #22m. It was shared by two
people. The lowest earned #122,510, when 133 people picked the winning
numbers.

A BOY was recovering yesterday after being bitten by a snake as he
played football with his friends.
Paul Mackintosh, 11, was detained in hospital overnight for
observation but yesterday he was back home at Daviot, near Inverness.
The only sign of his encounter with an adder were two tiny puncture
marks in his calf, where the snake pierced his skin.
Paul said: ''I was in goal and the ball went down the hill into some
whin bushes. I went to get it and stood on something which moved. Then I
felt a nip in my leg.
''I looked down and saw a snake with grey-black zig-zags on its back
wriggling away into the undergrowth.
''I got quite a fright. There was a bit of pain. Blood was dribbling
out of the fang marks.''
His mother, Mrs Elaine Mackintosh, said: ''He caused quite a stir at
Raigmore Hospital. Lots of staff were coming into the casualty
department to see the fang marks. The last snake bite case they had was
about six years ago.''
Mr Edwin Blake, head keeper of reptiles at Edinburgh Zoo said:
''Normally adders would disappear as they felt someone approaching. But
at the moment, as they are about to go into hibernation, they are quite
sluggish and incapable of getting out of the way.''

A FIVE-mile stretch of motorway was opened to cyclists raising funds
for the disabled yesterday.
The M8 extension from Newbridge to Edinburgh city by-pass was closed
to other traffic for the cycle race, organised by the nearby Trefoil
centre for the disabled.
Appeals director Sandra Stoute persuaded the Scottish Office to grant
permission for the event on the new #39m stretch of road.
The race was started by former British Lions and Scotland rugby
captain Gavin Hastings.
Later, Scottish Office Transport Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton
presented prizes to the competitors.
Lord James also announced a #5m package to improve cycling routes
across Scotland.
The package includes a bridge for cyclists over the M8, bicycle
crossings for other roads, and 31 kilometres of cycleway to be built on
trunk roads over the next five years.
The Minister extolled the virtues of cycling as healthy and
environmentally-friendly and pointed to the tourism potential for
Scotland of safe, traffic-free routes.
''There is considerable potential for marketing cycling in Scotland
along the lines demonstrated by the tourism success of long-distance
walking routes such as the West Highland Way,'' he said.

<RECORDNO>975405286</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Government has been accused of encouraging a ''culture of
secrecy'' in the NHS in its appointment of NHS trust chairmen.
Labour's Deputy Shadow Scottish Secretary John McFall made the claim
after Scottish Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton told him in a
letter: ''I do not share your view that it would be helpful to consult
widely in the local community'' when appointments were being considered.
Lord James had been responding to a complaint by Mr McFall following
the departure in July of the chairman of Lomond Healthcare NHS Trust, Mr
Stephen Newall, after only four months in the job and amid acrimony with
both hospital staff and officials of Argyll and Clyde Health Board.
Dumbarton MP Mr McFall had urged the Government to recognise that its
criteria for appointing trust chairmen did not take sufficient account
of the need to ensure that appointees enjoyed the confidence of their
local communities.
He also called on the Government to make public the source of
recommendations received for candidates.
Lord James had replied: ''We receive names from a variety of sources,
some of whom indicated already an interest in the appointment, others
whom we approach. Many of the individuals concerned would be unwilling
to let their names go forward if they felt that their candidature would
become a matter of public debate; and those who suggest names might be
reluctant to do so if they felt that their role in the process would be
made public.''
Mr McFall said: ''This illustrates the hypocrisy of Michael Forsyth's
talk about increasing accountability in Scotland. James Douglas-Hamilton
has made it abundantly clear that when these crucial appointments are
being made the Government is not interested in the views of the local
authorities, health groups, or anyone in the local community.''

MORE than 10,000 war veterans made it a record Remembrance Day
attendance at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, where crowds stood 12-deep on a
mild, still autumn morning.
The 50th anniversary of the end of the last war marked a level of
public participation not seen for decades. The Queen was joined by
almost every member of the royal family and many Commonwealth leaders.
The Queen Mother was absent for only the third time since the Second
World War. However, on Friday she did attend the annual open air Field
of Remembrance Service at St Margaret's Church, Westminster, where she
stood to observe a two-minute silence.
Forty representatives of the lesbian and gay community went to the
Cenotaph two hours after most of the veterans had left, to lay a pink
triangular wreath.
Peter Tatchell of OutRage dismissed criticism by the Royal British
Legion.
''The gay community has as much right to honour its members who fought
for freedom as anyone else,'' he said. ''The fact that over
half-a-million gays and bisexuals served in the military from 1939 to
1945 is never officially acknowledged by the British Legion.''
The skirl of the pipes drew hundreds of people to George Square,
Glasgow, where a guard of honour and band was provided by 3rd
(Volunteer) Battalion the Royal Highland Fusiliers.
Lord Provost Tommy Dingwall laid a wreath on the Stone of Remembrance
in the name of the citizens of Glasgow.
The rain held off until the exact moment of Last Post to signal the
two-minute silence, following on from the successful British Legion
''11-11-11'' tribute on Saturday.
The British Legion today starts the long process of deciding whether
to press for a November 11 two-minute silence to be made permanent.
Its officials do not wish to impinge upon the traditional Remembrance
Sunday marked the length and breadth of Britain yesterday.
A spokesman said: ''Initial reports suggest a very good public
response on Saturday to the first '11-11-11' campaign where a two-minute
silence was observed at the actual moment of Armistice.
''No final decision has been made on whether we should do it again but
we do not wish to touch Remembrance Sunday. It should remain the main
day for ceremonies.''
Edinburgh's Lord Provost Norman Irons attended the commemoration in
the Royal Mile. Lord James Douglas-Hamilton represented the Scottish
Secretary and Councillor Eric Milligan represented Lothian Regional
Council.
They were flanked by a guard of honour from all three Services and
numerous veterans from ex-Servicemen's organisations. A bugler from the
1st Battalion, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, sounded the Last
Post and a piper played the Flowers of the Forest lament.
The Lord Provost later unveiled a new memorial at Davidson's Mains. It
has a bronze plaque showing the names of 31 men killed in the last war
and the 136 who died in the First World War.
Retired builder Robert Brown, 66, led a three-year fund-raising
campaign to set up the memorial to Servicemen from Davidson's Mains and
Cramond.
In his address at Rosyth Parish Church, the Moderator of the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the Right Rev James Harkness, said
remembrance had a vitally important purpose as a means of passing on to
posterity the costly lesson of how greed and self-centredness, hate and
envy, and aggressiveness and grasping led to war.
He said that if we ignored that lesson we would all fail, and medals
would be turned into meaningless pieces of ribbon and metal.
Remembrance Sunday was marred in Fife when North East Fife district
councillor Peter Howling collapsed and died of a suspected heart attack.
Mr Howling, who represented the Kilrenny, Anstruther, and Carnbee
division, had just laid a wreath at Anstruther cemetery when he
collapsed.
There was similar tragedy at Berwick when legion standard bearer Jack
Arnott, 69, of Belford, collapsed and died as he paraded outside the
town's parish church before the service.

EUROPEAN Commissioner for regional affairs Monika Wulf-Mathies will
make the keynote speech at the annual conference of the East of Scotland
European Consortium in Edinburgh on Friday.
Mrs Wulf-Mathies -- who holds the purse strings to #1500m of European
regional funding -- is on her first visit to the UK.
Around 200 local authority representatives will attend the conference
in the hope of getting an indication on future cuts in grants as the EU
enlarges toward the end of the century.
The Commission has already ruled out significantly increasing the EU
budget to cope with enlargement to central and eastern Europe.
Instead, Mrs Wulf-Mathies has indicated she intends to tighten the
rules for regional aid among the current 15 EU members, to divert money
to the poorest areas.
This puts at risk the cash which Britain receives each year from
Objective Two regional aid grants to areas worst hit by the decline of
heavy industries such as coal mining and shipbuilding.
Mrs Wulf-Mathies's appearance at the conference will also attract
local authority representatives from France, Sweden, and Denmark.
The Commissioner will spend Thursday visiting areas in the central
belt which currently receive aid.

THE Queen's Speech on Wednesday announcing Government legislation for
the last full session of Parliament before a General Election, will
contain a number of Bills designed to wrong-foot the Labour Party.
Tory MPs concede that the new legislative programme offers the last
opportunity for Conservatives to gain ground on an Opposition which is
way ahead of them in opinion polls.
An immigration and asylum Bill would bring in stricter controls on
asylum seekers and enable the Tories to argue that they remain tougher
on immigration than Labour.
An education Bill introducing vouchers for nursery education should
give a high profile to an issue on which Labour MPs are split.
A criminal justice Bill which will require less of the prosecution
case to be made available to the defence will enable Tory MPs to
challenge Labour's claim to be, as Labour leader Mr Tony Blair put it,
''tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime''.
However, several Ministers have misgivings about the decision to put
the Lord Chancellor's divorce Bill -- an English measure -- into the
programme. The Government may seek to ease this dilemma by allowing a
free vote on contentious causes.
Among other measures will be: an Armed Forces Bill which could lead to
a vote on ending the ban on homosexuals in the Forces; a housing Bill
which will extend the right to buy and make it easier for landlords to
evict non-paying tenants; a Scottish education Bill which will include
reorganising the examining boards for higher education; and a red deer
Bill which will give authority for culling the expanding deer
population.
Another Bill will lay the ground for privatising the Student Loan
Scheme, currently administered by the Glasgow-based Student Loans
Company.

THE leaders of Monklands District Council face yet more scrutiny
today, when the official Government inquiry into allegations of nepotism
and improper practices gets under way.
Last week, Provost Eric Burns and council leader Jim Brooks were
interviewed by Labour Party leaders as part of an internal party
investigation. However, the results of the official investigation, held
under section 211 of the Local Government Act, could be more damaging
politically.
All Labour councillors at the authority were suspended on the orders
of Labour Party leader Tony Blair after the damning results of the
previous inquiry held by Professor Robert Black QC.
Professor Black will be among those giving evidence to Mr William
Nimmo-Smith QC, who is heading the new inquiry. Labour MPs Helen Liddell
(Monklands East) and Tom Clarke (Monklands West) will also give
evidence.
Mrs Liddell called for an official inquiry into the allegations during
her by-election campaign following the death of Mr John Smith. Last
night, she said: ''It has been a long time in coming but I am glad this
inquiry has finally arrived.
''I and my constituents are anxious that this situation will finally
be brought to a conclusion. Then we will be able to get back to giving
full concentration on the many issues affecting the constituency.''
All councillors are expected to be questioned as part of the inquiry.
Provost Burns was not available for comment last night. Councillor
Brooks refused to make any comment on the inquiry.
The latest inquiry begins amid new embarrassment for Labour in
Lanarkshire. North Lanarkshire, the shadow authority which will take
over from Monklands, is to be the subject of a Government inquiry into
appointments of top officials, after complaints made to the staffing
watchdog, the Local Government Staff Commission.

HIV campaigners yesterday reacted with anger and dismay over the
Vatican's suppression of an educational pack produced for Catholic
children in Scotland.
Archbishop Keith O'Brien, of St Andrew's and Edinburgh, himself a
former teacher, gave his support to HIV Prevention -- A Christian
Response as a means of explaining the issues to senior secondary pupils.
However, a group from his archdiocese complained to Rome over the
pack's comments on the use of condoms and acknowledgement of homosexual
relationships.
The Congregation for the Doctrine and the Faith, which oversees
worldwide doctrinal matters, told the archibishop to remove his
imprimatur and withdraw the packs from schools.
Mr Philip Collins, spokesman for the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:
''This is appalling and very frightening. It seems that the pack was
eminently sensible, carrying advice similar to what we would give.
''What the Catholic Church has now done is completely wrong and its
advice, if followed, will be responsible for killing a lot of people.
The scale of the epidemic in Africa is horrendous and if they keep to
the Vatican's line it will make it a lot worse.''
The packs were produced three years ago with the help of Lothian
Health Board. Its director of public health, Dr Helen Zealley, said: ''I
am disappointed because I had been impressed by the careful way in which
the Roman Catholic Church in Edinburgh had addressed this very difficult
and major problem.''
The intervention of Rome is certain to fuel deeper conflict within the
church between those who stand by strict orthodoxy and those who favour
a more pragmatic and compassionate response.
The co-author of the report, Father Tom Williams, drew on his parish
experiences working with people with HIV and their families in
Muirhouse. Only 150 copies of the #20 pack were published initially but
it proved so popular that another 250 were produced.
Fr Williams, who is now working for an inter-denominational HIV care
group in London, told The Herald: ''I am saddened and a bit angry that a
right-wing minority can hijack something where their position seems to
be black and white. . . It does make you question your faith. Is the
church about love and compassion or about power and control?
Archbishop O'Brien was not available for comment yesterday. Father Tom
Connelly, spokesman for the Catholic Church in Scotland, said the
imprimatur did not imply that the archbishop agreed with its contents
but that it was free from doctrinal or moral error. That was clearly not
the case.
''The use of condoms is always wrong in the eyes of the Catholic
Church. No matter what the situation is, it is wrong,'' he said.

FORMER Beirut hostage Jackie Mann -- the oldest Westerner to be held
captive in Lebanon -- died at his home in Cyprus yesterday, aged 81.
Mr Terry Waite and Mr John McCarthy, who were being held in the
Lebanese capital while Mr Mann was kept in solitary isolation by his
captors, last night paid tribute to a remarkable man.
''What one had to say about Jackie Mann's kidnapping was the
pointlessness and cruelty of it, particularly keeping him in solitary
confinement all that time,'' said Mr Waite.
''To keep an old man like that incarcerated was very cruel and the
fact that he survived that ordeal is a tribute not only to him but to
his generation.''
He added: ''It is quite poignant that he should die on Remembrance
Sunday. He gave so much during the war years and then he suffered that
indignity in his later years.''
Mr McCarthy, the television journalist kidnapped in Beirut in April
1986 and released in August 1991 -- a month before Mr Mann -- said: ''I
was on my own for three months in captivity. How Jack managed to stay
sane in solitary like that for over two years with no contact except for
that with his captors is astonishing.''
Mr Mann, whose wife died three years ago, died peacefully in his sleep
at his home in a Nicosia suburb, said his doctor, Cecilia Stephanou.
''He had been ill for some time and had 24-hour nursing. We had been
expecting his death,'' said Dr Stephanou. His health had deteriorated
over the past year and he was suffering from heart and lung problems.
Mrs Alison Chipperton, whose husband works at the British High
Commission in Cyprus, said: ''He was an extremely resilient man. Anyone
with a lesser character would not have survived what he had gone
through.''
Mr Mann, a former Battle of Britain pilot who was made a CBE in 1992,
and his wife lived in Beirut for 45 years.
They were the last British couple in war-ravaged west Beirut. They
would not leave the city they loved, though their flat had been bombed,
their horses and dogs killed, and their businesses and car blown up.
Mr Mann believed he was immune from kidnapping.''He got this idea in
his head, this fixation, that no-one would bother to kidnap him. He used
to say, 'I'm old and don't have any money. Why on earth would anyone be
interested in me?','' said Mrs Mann.
''But he would also admit that incarceration was the worst fate he
could imagine,'' she added.
Mr Mann was shot down six times flying Spitfires. He never once bailed
out, crash-landing every time. In April 1943, when a fuel tank was hit
by anti-aircraft fire over France, he glided back across the Channel
with flames roasting his cheeks and forehead.
Surgeons spent two years rebuilding his face after that last escape,
for which he received the Distinguished Flying Medal. The couple met in
London while Mr Mann, then 26, was recovering from his burns.
They went to the Lebanese capital in 1945, when Mr Mann was offered a
job with Middle East Airlines, and enjoyed a hectic social life and had
a wide circle of friends.
Mrs Dilys Mann -- nicknamed Sunnie since childhood for her
cheerfulness -- did not know which faction took her husband.
She survived months of bombardment in her lonely flat without friends,
neighbours, income, tap water or electricity, pledged not to leave
Beirut until she knew whether ''Jackie'' was alive or dead.
In a book of her experiences published in 1990, she wrote: ''Will he
survive long enough to be released? I'm trying to hold on and I pray
that he is holding on too.''
Mr Mann was seized on a city street on May 12, 1989, and freed on
September 24, 1991, following Israel's release of 51 Shi'ite Muslim
prisoners and the handing over of the bodies of nine Lebanese guerrillas
two weeks earlier.
''He's the same old Jack but he's so thin,'' exclaimed Mrs Mann who
flew to Damascus to welcome him home.
The wartime pilot was deeply moved by the sight of a Spitfire flying a
victory roll over RAF Lyneham, Wiltshire, where he began the weeks of
debriefing and rehabilitation.
When Mrs Mann died in December 1992 after a long struggle against
cancer, her husband was at her bedside.
A Foreign Office spokesman said last night: ''Jack Mann's unfaltering
courage, both in wartime and in his incarceration, was an inspiration to
us all. Our thoughts are with his family at this time.''

THE water regulator confirmed it has written to England's three
regional suppliers after the companies were criticised in a newspaper
report for alleged sub-standard services.
The Office of Water Services (Ofwat) has ordered an investigation into
a series of alleged failures, including supplying contaminated water and
missing targets in cutting leaks and breakdowns in supply, a
London-based newspaper reported.
The three water companies, named as Yorkshire, South West, and North
West, have been ordered to supply documents and make senior staff
available for interview, according to letters leaked to the Times.
Ofwat director-general, Mr Ian Byatt, has threatened that failure to
comply would result in him invoking special powers to force them to do
so, it said.
Allegations include delays on water treatment works at beaches,
failure to meet health and environment limits on pollutants, and
reducing the number of homes getting low pressure or interruptions in
supply.
Spokesmen for the three companies are reported as saying they would
co-operate with the investigation.
A spokeswoman for Ofwat last night said: ''We have written to three
companies but we do not comment on leaked correspondence.''

AN NHS trust last night rejected suggestions that 24-hour cover for
children requiring operations at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in
Glasgow is to be axed.
A newspaper report claims a memo it has obtained states that Yorkhill
NHS Trust plans to close all its operating theatres at night, between
midnight and 8am, with emergency staff being placed on stand-by at home
and brought into the hospital by taxi if required for an operation.
Dr Alistair Miller, medical director of the trust, said last night:
''There has been no change in policy regarding emergency admissions and
I have no knowledge of such a memo.''

JEHAN Sadat had a message of peace last night. This tiny, dignified
woman, the widow of the former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, spoke
with a catch in her throat, as she recalled how her own husband was
assassinated for the cause of peace.
She told the Joint Israel Appeal's annual dinner in Glasgow that, 14
years ago, she had taken three of her grandchildren to a military parade
for the first time. They had seen their beloved grandfather killed in
front of them. Yet that assassination had helped to unite the Egyptian
people and Rabin's would do the same for Israel, even bringing forward
peace.
Last night, she joined with some of Britain's most prominent Jews in
their grief for the loss of a peacemaker, killed by the bullet of a
fanatic, just as her husband had been.
Jehan Sadat is the daughter of a British, Christian mother from
Sheffield, and an Egyptian, Muslim, father. She was brought up to love
everyone, no matter what their religion.
''My mother left Sheffield and went to live in Egypt with the man she
loved. This is the atmosphere that I was brought up in -- that love
makes miracles,'' she said.
''My husband was not in my situation, which makes him all the more
remarkable.''
He had gone to Israel with an ''open heart and an open mind'', despite
the numbers of Egyptians killed by Israel.
Mrs Sadat told of how she heard the news that Mr Rabin had been killed
a little more than a week ago.
She had been writing a speech when a neighbour called and told her to
switch on the television. Then her son, Gamal, called her from Egypt.
At first, she thought Rabin's killer had been an Arab who was against
peace. Yet, as had happened with her husband, it was one of his own
people.
''There are so many things in common between Yitzhak Rabin and Anwar
Sadat. Both were farmers, both were soldiers, both went to war, both
made peace, between each other and between their countries. Both wives,
even, are active in society and working. Mrs Rabin is much more
outspoken. Both of us -- Leah Rabin and me -- were the head of our
delegations in Mexico City in 1975 at the International Women's year.
Both were killed because of peace -- and both were killed by fanatics of
their own country.''
Her first action was to write Leah Rabin a long letter of condolence.
She wanted to allow her at least three days before she spoke to her in
person. However, when being interviewed by Israeli Radio, she was urged
to call Mr Rabin's widow.
''I told her: 'I want you to be very strong. You are a courageous
woman, Leah. I want you to be always standing up so that he will be
proud of you, as he was always.' I just think we are luckier than other
women because our husbands made such tremendous achievements and left
behind a legacy which will never, never die.''
From the Arab world, only the leaders of Sudan and Oman had attended
Sadat's funeral, yet 14 years later, many more had gone to Israel for
Rabin's. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, prevented by security
concerns, had paid his respects in person to Mrs Rabin.
''I believe that human beings can be killed, like my husband and
Rabin. But the peace process can never, ever be killed. They sacrificed
themselves for the people of their countries, and for the whole region,
to live in peace. I believe that Israel will continue. Shimon Peres was
a partner of Rabin and he knows what he must do. There will be much more
progress,'' she said.
Fundamentalism, she said, was a problem faced by Muslims, Jews, and
Christians.
''The mother of the boy who killed Rabin has said: 'That boy is not
mine. That is the feeling of any mother who sees that her son went out
to kill'.''
She admitted: ''I do not know how to get rid of these fanatics.'' She
hoped they would see that their actions had been counter-productive,
that they had not stopped the progress of peace.
''It needs work. These fanatics -- it is not easy to change their
minds. In our country, the government has sent religious leaders to talk
to some of these fanatics in prison and explained to them that Islam is
not about killing or for revenge, and they have explained to them the
real religion,'' she said.
Some had repented, had been released from prison, and explained on
television that they had been wrong. Perhaps they would set an example,
she said.
Rabin's assassin was 24, her husband's had been 23. They were young,
immature, and needed guidance about their religion, because no religion
advocated killing, she said.
Everyone must make more efforts, starting with children from
kindergarten.
''Children must know about peace and how to live together, to care for
each other, understand each other, listen to each other, to know the
value of peace.''
She, herself, is a champion of women's rights in a Muslim world. It
was largely at her urging that her husband granted more rights to
Egyptian women than they had ever had before.
''What we took for Egyptian women reflects in the Arab world and other
African countries around us,'' she said.
''Sure, there is still much progress to be made. We need to be
peacemakers.''

A SCHOOLBOY was in a coma for more than 24 hours after allegedly
taking a spiked drink at a rave in Stornoway, it was claimed yesterday.
David Stewart, 15, from Lower Bayble on Lewis, was taken by ambulance
from the rave at Stornoway Town Hall early on Saturday.
Last night, his mother, Mrs Rena Gallagher, said David -- a pupil at
Nicolson Institute secondary school, who was at his first rave -- had
taken a drink he did not know had been tampered with.
Doctors became concerned about the boy's condition on Saturday and
were making arrangements to fly him to a mainland hospital. Mrs
Gallagher said he was unconscious until Sunday morning, when he began to
show signs of recovery.
A spokesman at Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway yesterday said he
was now in a ''stable'' condition.
Detective Sergeant Iain Mackay of Stornoway CID confirmed that another
youngster was taken to hospital during the late-night rave. The second
youngster was released after treatment.
Mr Mackay said: ''We will not be conducting further inquiries unless
we get information to suggest that illegal substances were being used at
the rave.''
He said there had been little in the way of trouble or disturbance at
the event.
David and his friends claim they had taken what they thought was water
to cool down near the hall door.
''Not long after David drank his, he collapsed in a heap on the floor.
There was something in it,'' said Mrs Gallagher.
Mrs Gallagher could not confirm claims from other youngsters that a
cocktail of rave drug ecstasy and paracetamol, ground down and dissolved
in water, was being handed around by some rave-goers.
The Stornoway rave was organised by M8 magazine, one of a series
across Scotland.
* A STUDENT was critically ill on a life-support machine in Broomfield
Hospital, Chelmsford, last night after taking a contaminated ecstasy
tablet. Leah Betts collapsed at her 18th birthday party at home in
Latchingdon, near Maldon, Essex, early on Sunday.

A JUNIOR football team is thought to have made Scottish soccer history
by refusing to restart a game because their centre forward had been
carried off with a broken leg within minutes of the kick off.
Forres Thistle were told last night they had forfeited Saturday's OVD
Junior Cup game against Glasgow side St Anthony's by refusing to play
on. The Thistle players could not continue after witnessing the injury
to striker Ian McLeod, 19, who was tackled by the opposition centre
half, Robert Stevenson.
An ambulance took McLeod to hospital. Then the referee, Mr Ross
McCluskie, from Ayrshire, called the team captains and officials into
his room.
Mr McCluskie was worried that they might not complete the game because
of diminishing light. Thistle said they would not restart the game,
which was then abandoned.
Thistle president David Gordon said they were disappointed but not
surprised that the Scottish Junior Football Association (SJFA) had
decided to award the tie to their opponents.
Mr Gordon said: ''My players could not have continued on the park and
played a game of football. We are all very upset but we will abide by
the SJFA rules.''
Mr Felix McKenna, secretary of St Anthony's -- who are based at
Moorpark -- said there were no hard feelings between the clubs. He added
that they had a history of exciting cup ties but admitted that the
players' refusal to restart the game was baffling.
He added that Stevenson's challenge, for which he was booked, had been
late but not malicious. Mr McKenna said the club had not claimed the tie
.
Mr Tom Johnston, assistant SJFA secretary, said he had consulted other
executive members by phone and it was decided to award the tie to St
Anthony's, who will now go into the draw for the third round .
He said it could be a unique event in the association's 109-year
history.
St Anthony's officials visited McLeod in hospital yesterday.

<TEXT>
THE President of the Board of Trade, Mr Ian Lang, is due to begin a
High Court action against insurance underwriters Lloyd's of London this
week in an attempt to recover losses approaching an estimated #1m.
Mr Lang is the highest-profile investor of the 1092 ''names'' on the
Rose Thomson Young syndicate action group, whose court case is scheduled
to start tomorrow.
Mr Lang and the other names will be claiming negligence in the way the
underwriting was carried out.
Other Tory MPs involved in the action group are Sir Richard Body, Mr
David Tredinnick, and the Earl of Arran.
The RTY syndicate lost up to #428m on a series of disasters, including
the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion and the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
Mr Lang is believed to have suffered losses of more than #800,000 on
his involvement in a number of loss-making syndicates.
The court case could be potentially embarrassing for Mr Lang as the
Department of Trade and Industry is the overall regulator for Lloyd's.
To avoid any conflict of interests, Mr Lang delegated responsibility
for the insurance market earlier this year to his junior Minister, Mr
Anthony Nelson.
This court case is the latest in a series of legal actions brought by
thousands of hard-pressed names, who have succeeded against managing
agents and auditors in negligence claims.
Lloyd's itself is currently putting together a #2800m settlement plan
which should be ready to put to names by next spring.
The Rose Thomson action follows that of another action group,
involving almost 2000 names from the Merrett 418 syndicate, which won a
landmark High Court victory almost two weeks ago against auditors Ernst
&amp; Young as well as the managing agents.
It was the first time an auditing firm had been found negligent in
recent names' court cases and Ernst &amp; Young immediately announced it was
appealing against the decision.
Although no compensation sum was given at the Merrett judgment, the
action group is claiming #300m.

A MAJOR consultation exercise will question 1500 people living in
Edinburgh on what the priorities should be for the new City of Edinburgh
Council.
The operationgot under way at the weekend and the council's Labour
leadership has promised that the opinions gathered will help shape
strategy for the new authority.
It decided against holding traditional public meetings to hear
people's views. Researchers will visit residents in their homes,
interviewing a cross-section of Edinburgh's geographical and
socio-economic makeup.
In addition to the survey, consultations are taking place with the
city's business community, and a major meeting between councillors and
around 400 representatives of voluntary organisations is planned for
later this month.
The council's Labour leader, Mr Keith Geddes, said it was a long-term
exercise.
''The council wants to bring the community much closer to the
decision-making process, encouraging participation and strengthening
democracy, and the results of the consultation programme will ensure we
have that concept well enshrined by the time the City of Edinburgh
Council takes over local government responsibility on April 1, 1996.''
The results of the consultation process will be reported to the full
council in February. After that, a development programme will continue
to consider how best services can be delivered and the nature and extent
of decentralisation wanted by local communities.

LABOUR'S Scottish executive has backed unanimously the decision to
postpone last week's meeting of the constituency Labour Party in MP
Irene Adams' Paisley North constituency.
The decision is likely to help pave the way for Labour's national
executive to appoint Mrs Adams as the next Labour candidate for Paisley
North rather than make her face a possible reselection contest with
other candidates.
Mr Jack McConnell, general secretary of the Scottish Labour Party,
postponed the Paisley meeting after hearing a number of complaints that
the party's rules were not being operated properly.
There are fears that attempts are being made unfairly to deselect Mrs
Adams as candidate. Now that the party's Scottish executive has endorsed
Mr McConnell's actions, it is likely that the national executive in
London will take the rare step of simply appointing her as the next
candidate, arguing that as the local party is not working properly then
it is impossible to have a normal selection procedure.
Mr McConnell has said that the constituency Labour Party in Paisley
North will stay suspended until he is convinced that it is operating
properly. Labour is keen to have all its candidates for the next
election in place by early next year and if the CLP is still suspended
then, it will be up to the national executive to step in and give Mrs
Adams a free run at retaining the seat.

CHANCELLOR Kenneth Clarke yesterday came under pressure from the Tory
right to put carefully-targeted tax cuts in the Budget ahead of
headline-grabbing income tax reductions.
The call from the failed leadership challenger, Mr John Redwood, came
amid reports that Mr Clarke was leaning towards a 2p cut on the 25p
basic rate of income tax.
Tory backbenchers are united on the overwhelming need for tax cuts to
revitalise dwindling support but divided over how to deliver them.
Treasury Ministers are believed to have made room for spending cuts of
up to #5000m in a tough public spending round and there now appears
little doubt that tax reductions will be the centrepiece of the Budget
on November 28.
The dispute centres on whether the reductions should take the form of
a high-profile income tax cut or of help aimed specifically at the
problems faced by tens of thousands of disillusioned Tory voters.
Mr Redwood, the former Welsh Secretary who stood for the leadership on
a tax-cutting platform, warned that the Budget could be the Government's
last chance to win back rapidly dwindling support.
''I would say restore mortgage interest relief to the standard rate of
tax, abolish VAT on fuel, and have a big increase in the allowances for
families and married couples,'' he said on LWT's Jonathan Dimbleby
programme.
He warned that the Government still had a lot of votes to win back if
it hoped to win the next General Election and must start to make amends
with both the Budget and the legislative package to be unveiled in the
Queen's Speech on Wednesday.
''People are very worried about their homes, their jobs,and their
families. They . . . don't feel the Government has been helping them
nearly enough,'' he said.
Mr Clarke is attempting to strike a balance between cuts in tax and
spending and the Government's commitment to improving public services.
Backbenchers fear that targeted cuts in indirect tax could be too
subtle a method of winning back support -- particularly if the pot is
not big enough to allow spectacular changes.
* The economy is more likely to slow down than pick up next year, with
unemployment staying above two million and earnings rising by only 1%,
the TUC warned today.
It urged the Chancellor to unveil an expansionist Budget, with
investment in housing and tackling long-term unemployment a priority.
The updated Budget submission to the Government forecast that
unemployment would remain above two million at the end of 1996 and
growth in average earnings would be closer to 1% than the 2% being
suggested by some forecasters.

MAJOR safety fears were raised yesterday by Shadow Defence spokesman
Dr John Reid over the decommissioning of the stricken Polaris submarine
HMS Renown.
The 7500-ton vessel has had to be prematurely mothballed only three
years after a #200m refit. Renown has not been back to sea since 1994,
when serious problems developed with her nuclear reactor.
No procedures have yet been agreed by the Ministry of Defence for
scrapping nuclear submarines and until now decommissioned vessels have
been laid up at Rosyth or Devonport. It is believed there are four
decommissioned nuclear-powered submarines already at Rosyth.
Dr Reid said he would be pressing the Government for answers on what
exactly the long-term risks were.
''There are worries that there have been leaks to the nuclear reactor
and throughout the piping system of this submarine. Just how safe is it
for the crew and the families living around the base?
''If it isn't safe enough for sea, where is it going to be safe enough
for it to go? There have been no decisions on how these submarines will
be dealt with, whether they be buried or dumped at sea or interminably
left at one of the ports.
''We need guarantees for the safety of the crew who are still working
on it and for the families of those people who live and work near it.''
Renown, which is currently based at Faslane on the Clyde, is the third
of Britain's four Polaris submarines to be scrapped. The 26-year-old
vessel still carries a full crew of about 300. The four nuclear
submarines were completed between 1967 and 1969 as Britain's
contribution to Nato's strategic deterrent.
HMS Resolution and HMS Revenge already have been decommissioned. Only
HMS Repulse is being retained. They are being replaced by the Trident
submarines, of which HMS Vanguard is already in service and HMS
Victorious will be available by the end of the year.
A spokeswoman for the MoD said last night that details of any defects
with the submarine could not be discussed because of security
considerations. ''Having said that,'' she added, ''there is no safety
risk from radiation to the crew or to the public.''
The Government faces an embarrassing time in the Commons over the
waste of public money involved. Labour is to call for a public inquiry
into the scrapping of Renown. The vessel was supposed to keep going
until 1997 after the refit, but has been tied up since August, 1994.
Dr Reid added: ''It looks like another scandalous waste of money --
#200m spent a few years ago for something which apparently has been laid
up, tied up, and doing nothing for the past 14 months and is now about
to be decommissioned.''
In a statement the MoD said: ''It has been decided that HMS Renown is
no longer required as part of our deterrent force. She will move in due
course to Rosyth to await decommissioning.''
The spokeswoman added: ''She was refitted between 1987 and 1992. At
that time the Trident programme was not finalised. The reason that
Renown was refitted was that it was essential to ensure that she was
still available to undertake duties.
''Although we were aware that the Trident would take over eventually,
that was still some time away. It is only now, when we have two
Tridents, that we are able to withdraw Renown.'' The spokeswoman added
that Renown had undertaken three operational patrols since her refit.

FIFTY activists agreed yesterday to invite miners' leader Arthur
Scargill to Scotland to discuss his plans to launch a new political
party, provisionally called the Socialist Labour Party.
Mr Scargill's nine-page discussion document -- details of which were
revealed in The Herald last week -- prompted yesterday's meeting in
Glasgow City Chambers.
Organised by the Scottish Socialist Movement, the meeting was attended
by trade unionists, community activists, campaigners against the M74
motorway, animal rights organisers, and members of the Labour Party,
SNP, Scottish Militant Labour, and the Communist Party of Scotland.
Among those attending were Mr John Milligan, of the rail union RMT,
and Scottish print union president Jim Friel.

IT'S a dirty job -- but where there's muck there's brass. As the
drought crisis deepens in Yorkshire, plans are now being drawn up to
employ school lavatory flushers at a princely #3 an hour.
Schools in Calderdale, which could be subjected to rota water cuts
this month, need people prepared to spend their day flushing lavatories
with buckets of water.
Existing staff, including mid-day supervisors and cleaners, have
already been approached. Calderdale's assistant director of education,
Mr Clem Rushworth, said most staff had happily agreed to take on the
job.
''Most people are willing to help out and do this job in what's going
to be an emergency situation,'' he said.
''They'll be standing by the toilets with buckets but they won't have
to flush after every child. It's a question of being there and using
their common sense.
''We are committed to keeping the schools open and this is one of the
things we need to do. If I had to do it myself to keep schools open, I
would.''
A public inquiry into Yorkshire Water's drought application starts
tomorrow and unless there is torrential rain or a 25% reduction in
demand, rota cuts could be introduced in Halifax and Huddersfield by
November 20.
Last week, Yorkshire Water signed a deal with Northumbria Water to
carry up to six million gallons a day from Kielder reservoir, near
Stockton, to Eccup reservoir outside Leeds.

LABOUR'S George Robertson insisted yesterday that there was no
rebellion by English Labour MPs against Scottish devolution despite one
MP threatening to embarrass the party by attempting to water down the
powers of a Scottish parliament.
Mr Robertson, Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary, was adamant that the
rebellion ''did not exist'' and that there was no threat to the English
regions from the powers of a Scottish parliament.
Nevertheless, any dissension within Labour will be seized on by the
Conservatives and Nationalists to claim that Labour, if it won the next
election, would have difficulty getting the legislation required for a
Scottish Parliament even past its own ranks.
Suspicions about a Scottish parliament have been expressed before by
North of England Labour MPs, who feared any favoured status for Scotland
would work against their area.
Labour believed it had answered their concerns in recent years and
that the possible rebellion had subsided. Yesterday, however, Mr John
McWilliam, MP for Blaydon on Tyne, told the BBC's On The Record
programme that northern Labour MPs may try to amend any future Scottish
devolution Bill to ensure Scotland had no powers to attract jobs and
investment which was denied to their area.
He said: ''You've got to remember that any legislation is subject to
amendment and we could be very embarrassing in terms of the way that
legislation passes.
''We could, for instance, take out some of the powers until such times
as we're given certain guarantees that wouldn't deny the Scottish people
their own elected parliament, it would just deny them one that could do
us damage until such times as we can level up the playing field again.''
Although Mr McWilliam is not a leading parliamentarian, he can not be
dismissed as an uninformed northerner. He comes originally from
Edinburgh, where he was a councillor and city treasurer before moving
South.
His complaint is that a Scottish parliament with fundraising powers
could offer additional grants to attract companies, which would be to
the detriment of the North. He said such powers would create ''real
problems'' in the North.
Another northern Labour MP, Dr Tony Wright, MP for Cannock and
Burntwood, also questioned on the programme whether Scotland could
justify continuing to have 72 MPs at Westminster once a Scottish
parliament was set up.
Mr Robertson firmly stated last night that there was no groundswell
amongst northern MPs and that Mr McWilliam's views were not typical. He
pointed out that the devolution policy was supported at Labour's annual
conference this year ''without a whiff of dissent'', and that Mr
McWilliam's comments were based on a misapprehension of Labour's
policies.
Other senior Labour officials also played down the dissent, arguing
that Mr McWilliam was misinformed. Although Labour would give a Scottish
parliament the ability to raise additional income through higher taxes,
it is power that is unlikely to be used.
Even if it was proposed, it is not feasible that Scottish MPs would
wish to give the money away in industrial grants, rather than on more
emotive subjects such as improving the health service or education.
Besides which, European Union rules limit the ability of individual
countries to offer additional financial inducements to companies.
In addition, Labour officials point out that a development agency for
the North has been promised by an incoming Labour Government, which
should allay Mr McWilliam's fears.
As for reducing Scots MPs at Westminster, Mr Robertson argued that if
it is right that there are 72 Scots MPs there to deal with issues such
as defence, then it was right that they should still be there after a
Scottish parliament is set up.

SIX hundred cattle infected with BSE -- the so-called Mad Cow Disease

Granada TV's World in Action programme will report the Ministry of
Agriculture estimates that for every one beast diagnosed as having BSE
-- Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy -- two go undetected into the food
chain.
The Government's chief vet, Mr Keith Meldrum, accepted thathis
scientists' own calculations showed this was the case.
He told the programme: ''Yes, that is a calculation that's been made,
that there are a significant number of cattle that could be going in for
slaughter that could be incubating the disease.''
Meanwhile, a BBC1 Watchdog report will reveal that, in a survey of
1000 adults carried out for the programme, 23% of adults have cut out or
cut down on beef.

A BITTER feud has broken out over fair representation in local
government after an SNP group found itself frozen out from influential
committees.
It has led the SNP on the new Falkirk Council to call on Scotland's
Local Government Minister George Kynoch to implement the clause in the
1992 Scotland Act which guarantees fair representation on council
committees and outside bodies to all parties represented within local
government.
In a dual attack, the SNP leader on Falkirk council, Mr David
Alexander, also has demanded action by Shadow Scottish Secretary George
Robertson.
Mr Alexander has urged Mr Robertson to accept responsibility for the
actions of the Labour administration on Falkirk Council and ensure that
recent decisions on joint board representation are reversed.
In April, the SNP, the main opposition group on the council -- with
eight seats to Labour's 23 -- was allocated only one place on the
authority's influential executive committee, whereas the Nationalists
believe they could have expected three.
The business of the council was then directed through this committee,
where the sole SNP member was unable to obtain a seconder, resulting,
the SNP believes, in Labour decisions being steamrollered through.
Now the SNP has been denied membership of the Forth Valley police and
fire joint boards.
The joint boards are made up of six members from Falkirk, three from
Stirling, and two from Clackmannan. The Falkirk members are comprised of
five Labour and one Independent. At present, the same Independents have
a power-sharing pact with Labour on Falkirk District Council.
Mr Alexander said: ''Tony Blair may talk of New Labour but what we are
seeing in Falkirk is true Labour.''
He added: ''The Labour Party cannot be trusted to uphold democratic
principles and exercise responsibility in a mature fashion.''
A Scottish Office spokesman said last night: ''We have not received
the SNP's letter as yet. However, the Secretary of State has said that,
if a council can't keep its house in order, he has the power to
legislate if necessary and he is willing to use this power if he needs
to.''

THE son of executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa yesterday paid a moving
tribute to his father after arriving back in London from a trip to the
Commonwealth conference in New Zealand.
Mr Wiwa, pictured being helped by a supporter and his girlfriend
Olivia Burnett, after a news conference at Heathrow said: ''I know that
my father's life work and legacy will be cherished and remembered. I
hope that in particular his call for a non-violent and peaceful approach
to the problems in Nigeria will be respected.
''And so I appeal to the Nigerian authorities, the Nigerian people,
and the Ogoni people to seek a peaceful outcome to our troubles as a
mark of respect to the memory of my father.''
He said his father cared passionately for the diversity of life on
earth. He believed in peaceful co-existence and the creation of a just
and fair society. ''In his grim struggle to defend these, he eschewed a
comfortable and safe existence and in the end gave his life for his
beliefs.
''My father achieved more in his lifetime than most men could ever
aspire to. He knew as his good friend Wole Soyinka wrote, 'The man dies
who stays silent in the face of evil'. As he himself said only last week
as he faced his executioners, 'You can kill the man, but you can't kill
his ideas','' Mr Wiwa said.

RELATIONS between Britain and Ireland deteriorated last night after
angry exchanges between the two governments over the deadlocked Ulster
peace process.
The row developed after a call by Irish Prime Minister John Bruton for
Britain to alter its stance to prevent the process stalling.
First, the Northern Ireland Office expressed ''dismay and
astonishment'' at the timing of his comments, and John Major made it
clear that concessions to Sinn Fein on the need to renounce violence and
make a start of decommissioning weapons were ''not on''. Then Mr Bruton
stood by his call and said he was surprised by Britain's reaction.
Mr Bruton's comments came in speech to an Irish Expatriates' dinner in
London on Saturday night. British Ministers were especially furious that
the speech was delivered on the eve of Remembrance Sunday and soon after
the discovery near the Irish border on Friday of a huge van bomb
believed to have belonged to the hardline INLA republican terrorist
group.
His call for almost immediate all-party talks on the future of the
province was criticised as ''extraordinary'' and ''regrettable'' by
British Government spokesmen.
One Government source accused Mr Bruton of carrying out ''megaphone''
diplomacy.
Mr Major, before leaving the New Zealand Commonwealth Conference early
to be back in Britain for the start of the new parliamentary session on
Wednesday, called Mr Bruton's remarks ''possibly the product of
frustration''.
He added: ''What is not a starter is for people to make it clear that
they would return to violence if they did not get their way in talks and
then expect to be admitted to talks on that basis. That is not on.''
Interviewed on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost yesterday, Mr Major said
the peace process would not be furthered by ''being reckless'' and
taking action which would be disowned by one or other of the parties.
Mr Bruton, whose speeches normally are marked by a guarded, cautious
and diplomatic approach, insisted on his return to Dublin that he had no
regrets.
''I absolutely stand by my speech, which was very carefully
prepared,'' he said.
The tone of Britain's reaction is understood to have shocked Dublin
officials.
The Taoiseach won backing from both the main Irish opposition party
and Sinn Fein.
Fianna Fail leader Bertie Ahern said: ''It is outrageous and
indefensible that after 15 months of ceasefire in Northern Ireland, the
British Government are refusing to convene all-party talks. The present
situation is intolerable.''
Sinn Fein vice-president Pat Doherty said the speech was ''very
positive'' at a time when Mr Major was being consistently negative.
However, Ulster Unionist Ken Maginnis said it was IRA-Sinn Fein who
were to blame for the hold-up as they had not yet accepted the
principles of the Downing Street Declaration made nearly two years ago.
Mr Major is expected to meet Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick
Mayhew to discuss the next moves to keep the peace process afloat.
Government sources are clear that the ball is in the Irish
Government's court. They are still smarting about Mr Bruton pulling out
of a scheduled meeting with Mr Major in September at the last moment.
The Irish Government signalled, they say, that while it agreed that a
''twin track approach'' should be tried, they were not happy about the
details.
The approach was basically that an international commission should be
set up to seek ways of decommissioning illegally held arms while
exploratory talks should be held with each of the Northern Ireland
parties on setting up a formal round-table conference.
British and Irish officials still are meeting regularly and it could
be up to them to devise a new definition of how the ''twin track
approach'' would work before British and Irish Ministers can meet again.
Northern Ireland Minister Michael Ancram has had a series of talks
with the loyalist parties since May and also has met Sinn Fein leaders.
The British Government is not ruling out further meetings with Sinn
Fein although the party vice-president, Mr Martin McGuinness, said
recently he felt the peace process was ''almost on the threshold of a
complete collapse''.
The Irish and nationalist side are hoping that President Clinton may
find a way of breaking the impasse when he visits Northern Ireland at
the end of the month.

THE extremist who killed Yitzhak Rabin had been ''brainwashed'', the
widow of assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said last night.
Mrs Jehan Sadat said her own husband's killer had been similarly
brainwashed.
Her message to extremists was: ''You killed my husband and Rabin but
you are not going to kill peace. Peace will continue in spite of the
tragedy we are going through. Peace will never stop.''
Last night, Mrs Sadat became the first representative of the Arab
world to address the Joint Israel Appeal's annual dinner. The event, one
of the most glittering fund-raising occasions in the calendar of British
Jews, was held in Glasgow.
Mrs Sadat described the Israeli Prime Minister, slain in similar
circumstances to her husband, as ''a great leader and a man for peace''.
Mr Rabin had said to her when he signed the Middle East peace treaty
in Washington: ''When I was signing, your husband's face was in front of
me.''
Last week, she telephoned Mr Rabin's widow Leah and told her: ''I want
you to continue with the same approach for peace. If we lose our
husbands, we have to stand up and continue with the message for peace.''
She added: ''Leah is a very, very courageous woman, much more than me.
I thought I was courageous when I lost my husband but she is more
courageous. It is a tragedy that we have lost another peacemaker.''
Despite the passing of the years, her husband's assassination had
never left her.
''I have always tried to keep it aside. I am a woman who is living for
today and tomorrow but I want to learn from the past and not live in the
past. When I heard of the assassination of Rabin, immediately I thought
of the assassination of my husband in front of me. It is very hard to
forget something like that,'' she said.
Asked if her husband's death had been a price too high, she replied:
''It is too high a price, it is a great loss, but for peace, I do not
regret.''

EXCLUSIVE
A GLASGOW garage proprietor has raised a court action for #800,000
damages against the Bank of Scotland and a further action for #50,000
against one of its managers.
Mr Magnus Mowetta, 44, of Torogay Street, Glasgow, alleges breach of
contract against the bank and the manager of its Partick Cross branch,
Mr Roddy Burgess, of Strathmore Avenue, Dunblane.
On December 6, a sheriff will decide if the case can be settled by
legal argument or whether witnesses will need to be heard in court.
Mr Mowetta set up Autofare in 1979 in Havelock Street, Glasgow.
By 1986, Autofare's turnover had reached nearly #1m a year. In 1992,
the premises were sold and the business divided. Mr Mowetta continued to
trade in Havelock Street as Autofare Garage. In 1993, he was evicted by
one of his former partners and moved to Balmore Industrial Estate.
The writ alleges that the ''defenders negligently advised the pursuer
to part with his control of the business and premises of Autofare in
transactions in 1986, 1988, and 1992''.
The writ also alleges that Mr Mowetta's cheques were dishonoured
''arbitrarily and without warning''. Mr Mowetta claimed there was a
substantial loss of confidence in him and his business, which resulted
in his turnover falling by more than #800,000.
A spokesman for the Bank of Scotland said: ''The bank is vigorously
defending the action raised by Mr Mowetta as are the manager's own
solicitors.''

CROATIAN Serbs yesterday agreed a peace deal over the disputed enclave
of Eastern Slavonia, opening the way towards wider peace in former
Yugoslavia.
After Serb leaders signed the draft accord deal at their base in the
town of Erdut, the United Nations mediator, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg,
said: ''I think we have experienced the start of the end of the war in
ex-Yugoslavia.
''I hope this agreement will have a contagious effect for the whole
area because it gives security and protection to all the people.''
He and American ambassador Peter Galbraith presented the Serbs with a
draft worked out by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic at the peace summit in Dayton, Ohio.
The 14-point agreement envisages restoration of Croatian control over
Eastern Slavonia after a transitional period of one year under
international military authority. The UN is to administer the territory
and provide peacekeepers during the transition.
The accord ends a Serb rebellion that erupted in war when Croatia
broke away from former Yugoslavia in 1991.
Under the agreement, almost 100,000 Croat inhabitants driven out of
the Eastern Slavonia region in the fighting would be able to return,
while Serbs who lived there when the war erupted could retain their
homes.
The Croatian army recaptured two other rebel Serb enclaves earlier
this year and President Tudjman had threatened to use force in Eastern
Slavonia if peace efforts did not work by the end of November.
Britain warmly welcomed the agreement.
''This is a major breakthrough. We congratulate the Croatian
authorities and the leadership of the Serbs of Eastern Slavonia for this
achievement,'' Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said in a statement.
''This agreement opens the way to a wider peace in the region. The
parties in Dayton should seize the momentum created by it to reach a
peace settlement on Bosnia.''
''The UK will work with other members of the UN security council to
ensure that the Eastern Slavonia agreement comes into force. We shall
also contribute with our EU partners to ensure the success of the
transitional period,'' Mr Rifkind said.

<HEADLINE>Arms sales banned. Shell puts off Nigeria gas deal</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

THE Shell oil company last night postponed a decision on signing a
#2500m gas deal with Nigeria as the international outcry over the
execution of nine human-rights activists reached a new pitch.
However, the president of football's world governing body, Joao
Havelange, said last night he would not let politics affect his promise
to award the 1997 world youth championships to Nigeria.
Mr Havelange, speaking on the eve of a Fifa symposium in Prague, said
sport and politics should not be mixed and it was not Fifa's job to
influence the course of world politics.
Shell claimed its move was made for purely commercial reasons but its
announcement came hours after Prime Minister John Major signalled that
the Government may apply pressure for the deal to be dropped.
The multi-national, which has massive interests in Nigeria, has come
in for fierce criticism since the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his
colleagues on Friday.
News of the impending gas deal sparked fury among exiled Nigerian
politicians who believe it would help prop up a brutal and discredited
military dictatorship.
Mr Havelange was in Nigeria amid the turmoil surrounding the execution
of Mr Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues.
After talks with Nigerian military leader General Sani Abacha, Mr
Havelange said that Nigeria might be given the 1997 youth finals due to
be held in Malaysia, with the Asian country holding them in 1999.
Because of the offer, Nigeria honoured Mr Havelange with a traditional
chieftainship.
He declined comment on his meeting with General Abacha, saying it was
the role of the Fifa boss to promote football, not interfere in
politics.
The international community yesterday continued to step up pressure on
Nigeria by backing up a two-year deadline for civilian rule with the
threat of expulsion from the Commonwealth.
Mr Major, leaving the Commonwealth conference in New Zealand,
announced an immediate British ban on arms sales to the regime and
called on other countries to follow suit. The European Union is expected
to heed the call.
The EU is also likely to suspend Nigeria's #84m aid package under the
Lome Convention this week.
The EU Commission suspended development co-operation with Nigeria --
but Britain expressed grave reservations over calls for United Nations
sanctions for fear of causing unnecessary suffering to an already poor
population.
Shell had set this Wednesday as the date for a final decision to
proceed on the gas deal but that meeting yesterday appeared to have been
hastily postponed.
A company statement said this week's date was agreed some time ago to
get together all parties involved in the deal, including the Nigerian
Government.
''That date has been superseded by a number of factors involving
establishing agreements and finding buyers for the gas,'' a spokesman
said.
The company declined to reveal when the decision to delay the meeting
was taken and would say only that it had been rescheduled to take place
before the end of the year.
Earlier, Mr Major had called for clarification of the company's plans.
''I don't know where Shell are with their contractual obligations and
I am reluctant to respond without knowing that,'' he said on BBC TV's
Breakfast with Frost programme.
''It is certain that the British Government will be in touch with
Shell to discuss their plans for the next few days.''
Nigeria is an immensely important region for Shell, which owns a 30%
stake in a joint venture with the state oil company -- a project which
accounts for 14% of the company's worldwide production of crude oil.
The gas deal would take four years to come on stream and Shell argued
that it would offer a massive shot in the arm to the impoverished local
economy.
Mr Brian Anderson, managing director of Shell Petroleum Development
Corporation of Nigeria, insisted: ''Neither we, nor our partners, nor
the Nigeria Government will see any revenues flowing from the project
until the early part of the next century.''
Commonwealth leaders set aside serious debate on economic sanctions,
in which the organisation can play little effective part, and the focus
will now switch to the United Nations in New York.
Britain's Overseas Development Minister, Baroness Chalker, was
cautious about the prospect of sanctions against Nigeria.
''It would mean an even worse situation for an already very poor
people. It is a most difficult thing to do and it could not be done by
the Commonwealth alone, it would have to be done through the UN,'' she
said.
''It is no good rushing into all manner of measures for appearances'
sake. They have to be measures that work and they have to be thought
through. We need to do this thoroughly and properly.''
No action was ruled out and she would be holding urgent talks with the
British High Commissioner, Mr Thorold Masefield, who has been recalled
to London.
In Brussels, Lord Plumb, British Tory leader in the European
Parliament, said: ''The military regime is totally unfit to benefit any
longer from EU assistance. I am concerned about what now faces the 40
prisoners still accused of treason, including Chief Moshood Abiola, the
winner of the 1993 presidential elections.''
Similar calls for a cut in assistance have come from Labour's Glenys
Kinnock, who led a campaign last week to save Mr Saro-Wiwa's life.
Nigeria's Foreign Minister, Chief Tomi Ikimi, yesterday called his
country's suspension from the Commonwealth ''unfair and unjustified''.
He told a news conference in Auckland that the decision, taken after
reports that Mr Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues had been executed, was not
based on an official statement from Nigeria but on media reports.
''There is no official confirmation of the execution of the death
sentences on Ken Saro-Wiwa and the others,'' he claimed.
Chief Ikimi said Nigeria ''deserves better treatment''.
He said Mr Saro-Wiwa and his accomplices were guilty of ''gruesome
murders''.

IT WAS Damon Hill's day in Adelaide yesterday even if it was Michael
Schumacher's year as the Formula One season came to an end with the
Australian Grand Prix.
The 35-year-old Hill, who cruised to his thirteenth victory in his
fifty-first grand prix, was content with his latest success. ''This is a
very satisfying and special victory for me and the team,'' he said. ''We
have had a long season and this gives us cause for celebration.
''It is my thirteenth victory and I had started to wonder when it
would come. But everything went my way. The celebrations will be
wonderful.''
However, one man who was not celebrating yesterday was Scotland's
David Coulthard, who, starting from pole position, did well early in the
race, outpacing his team-mate, Hill, to the chicane.
Coulthard stayed in front until the twentieth lap when, coming in for
a pit-stop, he slid off the track and crashed into the pit-lane entry
wall. He said his car had over-revved and locked up.
In front of an all-time F1 record crowd of 205,000, Hill steered his
Williams through the debris of his rivals' retirements to finish more
than two laps clear of second-placed Frenchman Olivier Panis, in a
Ligier, while Gianni Morbidelli, in a Footwork, secured the best result
of his career by taking third ahead of Britain's Mark Blundell, in the
sole McLaren following the recent accident which took his team-mate Mika
Hakkinen out of contention and into hospital.
Hakkinen's fellow Finn, Mika Salo, finished fifth in a Tyrrell and
Portugal's Pedro Lamy sixth for Minardi, both three laps down on Hill as
the massive crowd invaded the circuit to celebrate.
World champion Schumacher, in his Benetton, was one of those forced to
retire in a race where only eight of the 23 starters finish. His
team-mate, Johnny Herbert, missed out on third place in the drivers'
championship when the back of his car caught fire and he was forced to
pull out from a solid second position behind Hill.
Schumacher and Ferrari driver Jean Alesi collided on the twenty-second
lap as the German began to recover from a pit-stop delay. It seemed he
had passed Alesi, but the Frenchman cut into him and damaged his rear
wheel and suspension.
''He had no chance of passing me there and it was a wrong move,'' said
Schumacher. ''But it has been a great season so I just want to forget
it, have a party, and look forward to the future.''
The two men swop teams next season, with Schumacher going to Ferrari
and Alesi to Benetton, where he will be joined by Ferrari team-mate
Gerhard Berger, who retired yesterday with a blown engine. Result:

EVEN before the TV programme, Football, Faith and Flutes, had been
shown last night condemnation was loud, but most of the pre-screening
criticism was directed at the makers of the programme.
How dare outsiders arrive in our midst and attempt to hold a
magnifying glass over the way some of us live our lives. We know better
than anyone that we have certain difficulties to overcome before we can
become a truly civilised community and we don't need talking heads or
anyone else who likes to chatter until he disappears up his own
conclusion telling us something is amiss. We know. WE KNOW.
Trouble is, we all accept the kind of distorted logic which drives
some of the people whose very existence made it possible for the
programme to be put together. The trouble is, we simply do not do enough
to rid our landscape of religious bigotry and, because of that, none of
us has any right to attack anyone else who may wish to highlight the
problem.
Last night's programme was not made because of a strong social
conscience or some altruistic desire to play a part in making the
country a bigot-free zone. It was made because it would shock viewers
who are not fully aware of the levels of hatred which exist.
The show sent out the wrong signals in that it would have reinforced
the notion held by the rest of the nation that we, in the west of
Scotland in particular, are beneath contempt. It held us all up to
ridicule, because outsiders will regard us all as one and the same:
poisoned, diseased, unworthy of human status, bigoted.
We may recoil in horror, but we would have no right to react that way.
Truth is, all of us who have allowed bigots to taint us or to invade our
space in the streets or in football grounds deserve the scorn of others,
because we should be standing up for ourselves and for decency.
It is also the case that the Old Firm themselves have not done enough
to make their grounds decent places in which to watch sport. A new
millennium is almost upon us, yet we are still living in a dark and
spiteful world in which ancient and anti-social mentalities are still at
work.
However, it is never too late to fight back and both Rangers and
Celtic could play a leading role in delivering the message that bigots
are unwanted. Neither David Murray nor Fergus McCann took part in the
Witness programme, presumably because they wanted to distance themselves
from the people who featured, but that doesn't begin to cover it.
Murray and McCann and their clubs have a greater responsibility, and
they should be at the forefront of attempts to reduce the levels of
religious hatred which can always be seen and heard inside Ibrox and
Celtic Park. The behaviour of many of the fans of both clubs is totally
unacceptable, yet how many times do we hear loud and official
denunciations?
Hardly ever, is the answer to that one, and that in itself is an
indictment on these two organisations.
Football is trying hard to enter the modern world, but the sport
cannot hope to find a respectable corner for itself while dragging along
behind it the festering baggage of another more primitive time.
There are few more depressing sights at the football than to see
adults with tattooed faces, contorted and spouting hatred, with their
children at their sides. These kids have no chance of becoming anything
other than bigots themselves and the hatred is maintained.
Murray, McCann and other chairmen ought to be making announcements
about the need to rid the game of religious hatred and they should be
telling the people who indulge they are no longer wanted.
Every time a sectarian song or chant rises from the stands, messages
from the chairmen condemning the behaviour should be flashed across the
scoreboards. Also, the police should be harder on anyone who hurls
abuse. The football ground should be no different from the street, where
a particularly loud or obnoxious bigot could be arrested.
It is time to toughen up against people whose very presence at a
match is an affront to decency and until they are removed, or silenced,
football will never become a family sport.
It makes absolutely no sense at all to take your children into a
stadium where you know they will be subjected to obscenities and hatred
. . . unless, of course, you happen to be a bigot yourself.

SCOTLAND striker John McGinlay will speak to his club, Bolton, today
and ask to be updated on Celtic's reported interest in signing him.
I understand that the Parkhead club have followed up a long-held
interest in the 31-year-old Scottish internationalist, and that the
Premiership side are currently considering their options.
This morning, McGinlay will make it clear to joint-manager Colin Todd
-- who shares the managerial duties with his former Derby team-mate Roy
McFarland -- that he wants to be kept informed.
Yesterday, as he joined up with the Scotland squad at Hampden,
McGinlay pointed out: ''The management at the club know my admiration
for Celtic. They are in no doubt about how I feel. I have never hidden
my feelings for Celtic and it has always been my dream to play for them.
''To be honest, no other club would ever be able to tempt me away from
Bolton. I have had three great years at Burnden Park and the fans and
everyone at the club have been superb.
''But if Celtic want me, then I want to know about it, and everyone
knows my feelings about moving back and being at Parkhead. I've even
sold my pub in Bolton, so you can say I have begun to cut my ties.''
McGinlay still has 18 months of his present contract to run. He was
bought for just #145,000 by former manager Bruce Rioch when they moved,
almost in tandem, from Millwall.
Now Bolton could cash in with close to #1m for the Highlander, who has
followed Celtic since he was a youngster in Fort William.
Parkhead manager Tommy Burns is already on record as saying that all
his current squad needs in order to find success is an out-and-out
striker. He looked at Ian Rush after having been linked with McGinlay at
the end of last season. Now his interest in the Bolton front player has
been revived.
This morning Celtic may be given the transfer go-ahead, and if so
McGinlay will not hesitate about joining them. ''Celtic have been
playing very good football this season,'' said the player, ''and I know
I could fit in and do a job for the club. I hope I can find out what
exactly is happening when I speak to Colin Todd in the morning.''
Meanwhile, Scotland manager Craig Brown will be without Aberdeen
defender Stewart McKimmie and Celtic captain Paul McStay for the game at
Hampden against San Marino on Wednesday.
Stuart McCall, of Rangers, also is a worry but skipper Gary McAllister
will play. And Brown insisted, following his row with Leeds when the
captain was injured in Stockholm: ''We are making no concessions. If
Gary is fit then he will be playing the whole game. If he feels the
injury, then he might come off.
''I have spoken to Howard Wilkinson and everything has been cleared up
following the injury Gary had in Sweden. But we are not backing down at
all.
''Gary came in today and said he was ready to play and that is good
enough for me.''
Brown looks ready to use Eoin Jess as a front player in the match
despite the fact that Jess has been operating in midfield for his club,
Aberdeen.
''I look towards the European finals,'' said the manager, ''and if
anyone asks me if I am happy about my midfield situation, then I would
say 'yes.'
''But I am looking for a partnership up front, be it Eoin Jess and
Scott Booth, or some other pairing. We have had problems in that area
and I want to look at everyone.
''I won't bring anyone in to cover the injured players because I named
22 to begin with. We have enough cover, especially as the match is not
as important as it might have been.
''It will not affect our qualification chances -- but we do want to
rack up a fifth victory.
''When we said we wanted to win our last five games after we drew in
Moscow, there were cynics who thought we couldn't do it. A win on
Wednesday will complete that sequence.''
The SFA anticipate a crowd of more than 30,000 to watch the match.
The Under-21 team, also on the verge of qualification for the European
Championship quarter-finals, will go into their game without Aberdeen's
Stephen Glass and Rangers' Charlie Miller.
If they win at Firhill, then they will be in the last eight. But as
their manager, Tommy Craig, stressed yesterday, they are in the same
position as the full side. They may qualify without kicking a ball.
If Russia beat Finland in their Under-21 clash, then the Scots are
through and the San Marino game becomes meaningless. Even if Finland do
win in Russia, then a victory for the young Scots will guarantee them
qualification.

SWEDEN'S Liselotte Neumann produced a barnstorming finish to take the
women's Australian Open into a play-off in Melbourne yesterday before
winning the title in dramatic fashion.
Neumann, who had led after all three previous rounds, fell behind, but
birdied the final three holes to join countrywoman and holder Annika
Sorenstam and American Jane Geddes in a tie at 283 -- nine under par --
over the par-73 Yarra Yarra course.
All three players birdied the first play-off hole -- the par-5
eighteenth -- but Geddes dropped out when the two Swedes birdied on the
second play-off hole and the American could manage only a par. Geddes
had earlier seen her eagle putt for victory on the final regulation hole
lip out.
On the third play-off hole, Sorenstam found a fairway bunker with her
driver. The 24-year-old pushed her second down the fairway, her approach
finished just off the green and she failed to hole her chip for a
birdie.
Neumann hit a perfect drive and rifled a fairway wood to within 20
feet. Her eagle opportunity missed by eight inches, but she safely
tapped in for a birdie and the title.
Neumann has now added the Australian crown to her string of national
victories -- she has also won the US and British Opens, the French,
German and Singapore Opens and the Swedish Open three times. ''After 15
holes I almost thought I was out of it,'' she said. Leading scores
(Australians unless stated):
283 -- A Sorenstam (Sweden) 70, 75, 69, 69; L Neumann (Sweden) 67, 74,
71, 71; J Geddes (USA) 68, 74, 71, 70 (Neumann won play-off at third
extra hole).
284 -- K Webb 73, 74, 67, 70.
289 -- A Nicholas (England) 76, 72, 68, 73.
292 -- R Walton (USA) 74, 71, 75, 72; H Wadsworth (England) 75, 74,
67, 76.
293 -- E Klein (USA) 75, 74, 74, 70; C Hall (England) 69 79, 73, 72.
295 -- B Burton (USA) 74, 75, 69, 77; S Higgens (New Zealand) 76, 73,
77, 69.
296 -- A Munt 76, 75, 71, 74; D Reid (Scotland) 73, 75, 72, 76; R
Hetherington 74, 71, 73, 78.
* DEFENDING champion Laura Davies fired a two-under-par 70 yesterday
to win the Itoen tournament in Chonan, Japan, by two strokes.
Japan's Mayumi Hirase, this season's leading money earner on her home
tour, bogeyed the last two holes to squander her chance. The two had
been level after 11 holes.
Davies finished at 211, five under par, for her third victory on the
Japan tour. She collected #72,000.

COLIN Montgomerie fired a final-round 71 to finish fourth in the
Taiheiyo Masters in Tokyo yesterday. The Scot, who had moved within two
shots of the lead with a 66 on Saturday struggled with a left wrist
injury and finished with a four-round total of 280, eight under par --
six adrift of winner Satoshi Higashi of Japan.
He said: ''My wrist is very sore and I think I've aggravated it. I
didn't play very well at all and I was leaking the ball out to the
right.''
The Scot, making his first appearance in Japan, is doubtful for this
week's Dunlop Phoenix tournament. ''I looked forward to these two weeks
and it's a shame not coming here 100%,'' he added.
Higahi shot a five-under-par 67 to clinch the title on the
14-under-par total of 274 and collected the #180,000 first prize. He was
four shots ahead of countryman Shigeki Maruyama, with defending champion
Jumbo Ozaki, also from Japan, a further shot back in third.
Germany's Bernhard Langer shot a 68 and tied for ninth at 284. Leading
aggregates (Japanese unless otherwise stated):
274 -- S Higashi 70, 66, 71, 67.
278 -- S Maruyama 70, 72, 68, 68.
279 -- M Ozaki 73, 69, 69, 68.
280 -- C Montgomerie (Scotland) 74, 69, 66, 71.
281 -- H Kase 70, 69, 74, 68.
282 -- S Ginn (Australia) 72, 71, 67, 72.
Other scores included: 284 -- B Langer (Germany) 74, 74, 68, 68. 287
-- L Mize (USA) 75, 75, 69, 68; G Norman (Australia) 74, 71, 71, 71. 288
-- P Senior (Australia) 73, 71, 71, 73. 289 -- P Mickelson (USA) 74, 74,
68, 73. 290 -- B Lane (England) 71, 74, 69, 76.
* JIM Colbert stumbled to a one-shot victory yesterday in the US
Senior Tour championship in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. He shot a
closing two-over-par 74 for a 282 aggregate, one ahead of Ray Floyd who
finished with a 69.
Britain's Tony Jacklin ended with rounds of 81 and 74 to be 19 shots
off the pace.
* JOHN Cook's closing 69 for a 15-under-par aggregate of 273 won the
Mexican Open in Mexico City yesterday by one shot from Scott Verplank.
* STIRLINGSHIRE won the West of Scotland Inter-County championship on
Saturday, despite losing their final match. Renfrewshire spoiled the
champions unbeaten record by beating them 7[1/2]-2[1/2] at Airdrie.
However, Glasgow only drew against Renfrewshire at Renfrew to finish
second overall. Lanarkshire won the B competition when they defeated
Stirlingshire 5[1/2]-4[1/2]. Results:
Ayrshire A 5, Dumbartonshire A 5 (at Barassie); Renfrewshire A 5,
Glasgow A 5 (at Renfrew); Lanarkshire A 7[1/2], Stirlingshire A 2[1/2]
(at Airdrie); Dumbartonshire B 5, Ayrshire B 4 (at Balmore); Glasgow B
5, Renfrewshire B 4 (at Pollok); Stirlingshire B 4[1/2], Lanarkshire B
5[1/2] (at Dunblane New).

BY now, Ally McCoist should be raking up the leaves in his back
garden, taking leisurely walks with his son, Alexander, and Arnie, the
family dog, and then soaking in hot tubs to ease the old bones and
joints. His football boots should be lying somewhere in the back of a
cupboard. Rumour has it McCoist is all washed up, a spent force who
should take his leave of the People's Game before they start laughing at
him.
It is a suggestion which tempts laughter of his own, but he makes do
with a wry smile. The Rangers and Scotland striker has heard it all
before, and knows that every time he goes through a period when his form
dips, severe criticism will come his way.
Strangely, for a footballer who has scored so many goals, this is the
way it has always been.
''Just a person who is allowed no in-betweens,'' he says. ''I'm either
scoring or I'm hopeless.''
There is no doubt McCoist has rarely enjoyed proper and widespread
recognition for his exploits in and around opponents' penalty boxes, and
although there have been times when disrespect cut deeply, he would
always strike out and score. A goal and a smile, McCoist's own manner of
reply.
Trouble is he has become a victim of his own success and although he
has scored eight goals in 11 starts, supporters believe his strike rate
has slowed. Little consideration is given to the fact that McCoist is
trying to forge a partnership with his new frontline partner, Oleg
Salenko, after a superb run alongside Mark Hateley.
The McCoist-Hateley alliance was one of the most productive in
Rangers' history and the dismantling of that strike force, with the
Englishman off to Queen's Park Rangers, has reduced the scoring rate
significantly.
Also, the Champions' League adventure, which is degenerating into a
miserable experience, has been encouraging Ibrox fans to look at their
players in a different light.
It is unfortunate Rangers were drawn in what appears to be the most
difficult group, and certainly against one of the best teams in the
world, Juventus, but it is beside the likes of Ravanelli, Vialli, and
Del Piero that McCoist and his team-mates are being judged.
It is unfair, but no-one ever said justice had a prominent role to
play in football. McCoist, of course, knows that better than most, and
finds that so far as many of the fans are concerned, he has still to
prove himself, which is an absurd state of affairs after his goals.
''The one thing I do find as I grow older is that criticism doesn't
hurt me. I've always been a realist and I know what fans are like, but I
can put my hand on my heart and say I am proud of the number of goals
I've scored.''
There are a large number of doubters among Scotland's support also,
and when McCoist was listed last week in Brown's squad, there was muted
condemnation of the choice. The fans want a glimpse of the future and
McCoist, they say, is not in their vision of tomorrow.
McCoist, who was a substitute for Rangers against Aberdeen on
Saturday, knows he may have to hang around in the dug-out at Hampden on
Wednesday as Scotland's manager Craig Brown takes a look at other
striking possibilities in the final European Championship qualifying
match against San Marino. Brown will want to study Eoin Jess in action
and perhaps also Scott Booth, but sitting out while others try to unseat
him is not a new experience.
When Graeme Souness was manager at Ibrox, he tried to pair Hateley
with Maurice Johnston, but with great dignity and patience, McCoist
survived, regained his place and continued to be a prolific scorer.
Again, however, his abilities are being questioned with even though we
should know by now that it is dangerous to dismiss someone like him.
''Let me point out that anyone who wants to displace me in the
Scotland side will have to score a fair number of goals themselves,'' he
said. ''I'm not ready to give way yet.''
After a total of 307 goals for Rangers in all competitions and 16 for
Scotland -- a strike rate of one in three games -- McCoist is due some
respect -- even some thanks. When he went on to the pitch to take over
Alexei Mikhailichenko on Saturday, the 33-year-old was taking part in
his 500th first-class match for Rangers.
''Craig Brown has to look ahead, I am aware of that, and I also know
that Sctland's goals in the future will have to come from Scott Booth,
Eoin Jess, and Duncan Ferguson, but I believe I have more to do for the
national team yet.
''I'd like the chance on Wednesday to show these players I've
mentioned they'll all have to wait. They are still going through the
European and international learning processes, whereas I've been over
the course and distance. Scott's scoring record with four goals from
eight caps is a good one, but it is still early for him.''
It has always been fashionable to describe McCoist as the luckiest
player who ever walked on to a pitch, but again that is the same as
saying he is not a top-class striker, even though he is only six short
of setting a new Ibrox league record.
Bob McPhail's mark of 230 has stood for decades, but it is often
forgotten McCoist scored 22 league goals for St Johnstone before moving
to Sunderland, with whom he found the net eight times during a brief and
ill-fated spell.
''Of course, every player needs a good share of the breaks, especially
strikers, but nobody could possibly be so lucky as to score the number
of goals I have,'' he says. ''I hear what people say about me, but I
think I'm being judged unfairly.
''I'd have to be superhuman to score, say, 50 goals in a season, but
I'm expected to get up near that total because I did it in the past when
I won the Golden Boot Award twice.
''But we are playing totally different style now and my old ally, Mark
Hateley, who created a lot of goals for me, is away.
''Oleg (Salenko) is a different type of player and won't create as
many opportunities, and so I think I am a victim of my own scoring
rates, although I don't think my rate so far this year is too bad. I've
made only about 12 starts and I've scored nine times.
''My scoring rate with Scotland is not bad either and if I play
against San Marino, naturally I'd hope to improve on it. It is fair to
say that playing as striker for the national side is not easy because in
many of the games we are not widely tipped to win and sometimes scoring
chances are few.
''However, over the course of the current European Championship
qualifying campaign, Scotland have developed strong qualities in that
they are very hard to beat and they can pull out results when they are
needed.
''Of course, everyone will see the game on Wednesday as one we should
win easily and I see it as something of a repair job which is necessary
after the poor performances of our club sides in Europe.
''A few goals would give us all a lift, and when you weigh everything
up, we really should be able to get them.''

WILL Carling has been in the wars recently -- mainly off the rugby
field. The puff-chested captain of England has been portrayed as a
somewhat pathetic wimp following his interlude with the Princess of
Wales and his wife has thrown him out in disgust.
Of course, Will, mocked for his calls by mobile phone to you-know-who,
must appreciate the irony of the company which is set to provide
''several millions'' as sponsors of the English international squad.
Perhaps Cellnet should just waive his bill.
But even for their millions, the company will not be allowed to put a
logo on the precious English shirt, as only Tony Hallett, the RFU
secretary could say: ''The sanctity of the English shirt and the rose
emblem is part of English policy.''
Carling did get it right when he described the men who run rugby in
England as a bunch of ''old farts.'' Last week, when they published
their blueprint for the future of the professional game, among their
suggestions was a hare-brained plan to move the Five Nations' tournament
from the deep mid-winter to consecutive Saturdays and Sundays in May.
There may be advantages (although I can't think of any), but they are
heavily outweighed by the disadvantages.
One of the arguments put forward is that players would be fitter by
May. But surely after a long, hard season that's unlikely, and playing
so many internationals in such a concentrated period would give the
players little chance to recover from any knocks between games.
Happily, the suggestion was greeted with little warmth by any of the
other unions involved. Bill Hogg, the SRU chief executive, stressed that
any decison about the time of the competition would be a joint one. The
Welsh dismissed the suggestion.
Of course, in May there are also many other opposing attractions. In
France, the club season is at its height. It is also the month for
football finals on the domestic and European front, and in Ireland, the
national hurling league is to the fore. But these basic considerations
seem to have been ignored.
Part of the ethos of the Home Internationals series is to get wrapped
up in several layers of clothing and roast your lungs out on a winter's
day. Basking in sunshine doesn't compare. But most importantly, the plan
completely ignores the paying public.
A straw poll among local rugby club members revealed a horror of
moving the games to May. ''So many of us look forward to the trips to
Wales and Ireland in February and March. It's an integral part of the
club. With this idea, a part of the culture would disappear,'' said one.
Clubs all over Scotland have reciprocal arrangements with their
counterparts in the other countries. They play a game in the morning,
and then go to the international in the afternoon before being let loose
at night.
The camaraderie that has grown up over many years would disintegrate
as fewer made the pilgrimage to away games. The Sunday play would make
the journey impossible for those who have work on a Monday morning.
Although at one level of the game, players may be paid, at the other
end of the scale, there are those who struggle to make ends meet from
week to week. So while the fat cats of rugby can afford a concentrated
feast in May, many club players and their familes cannot do so.
Perhaps someone could pass on a message to those who propose ''New
Rugby.''
Yes, by all means carry on with your race towards commercialisation
and professionalism and all the trappings that go with them. But leave
the Five Nations' Championship alone.

THE guy who owns the current lease to this column returns next week --
fit to continue the diarist's usual round of eating other people's free
lunches, and eavesdropping on private conversations held on licensed
premises.
This is no job for a poet-philosopher like myself, who does not get
around much any more. But I will have a last stab at it. Every good
diary column contains three essential ingredients -- a story the
tabloids would kill for which is tossed away dismissively, a good joke,
and a daft competition. Here goes.
Gazza goes house hunting. Last week, the Ibrox Geordie was reported to
have had a dust-up with his partner, Sheryl, over dinner in Quaglinos in
London, a restaurant which, in my experience, was once rather fussy
about who should dine at its elegant tables.
Sheryl is expecting Gazza's bairn, and happily the little tiff was
quickly smoothed over. But the lassie must have said: ''Gazza, you've
got to find a home for us.'' So the Geordie picked up his mobile and
headed out to Pollokshields, where Cala is building a little scheme of
des res's, and knocking them out at #250,000 a throw.
Now Gazza's job is so breathtakingly demanding that it permits no time
for the usual delights shared by a young couple about to become proud
parents. He can't spare a few hours in front of a coal fire, his arm
around his loved one, deciding which wallpaper would be most suitable
for the new-born miracle's bedroom.
In short, Gazza wants to buy a show house, fitted out down to the last
douvet and drape, a veritable temple to Laura Ashley. ''I'll take that
one,'' he said in Pollokshields. ''Unfortunately, sir, it is already
sold to another client,'' the salesman replied.
But Gazza did not get where he is today without a great deal of moral
fortitude. Twenty-four hours later he was out at another scheme,
Auchenbothie in Kilmacolm, a small Renfrewshire village not known for
its rows of miners' cottages.
''I'll have that one,'' he said, looking at another showhouse. ''I'm
afraid, replied the salesman, ''that it will not be available until
February, sir.''
So there the matter rests. Gazza homeless, shock horror. Next, the
tabloids will have pictures of him flogging ''The Big Issue.''
NOW the daft wee story goes like this. Dundee United were reported to
be interested in re-signing Duncan Ferguson.
The club chairman, Jim McLean, even headed to Barlinnie for a
head-to-head with the man he launched on an unsuspecting football world.
''Would you,'' he asked Big Dunc, ''be interested in coming back to
Tannadice.''
''No, thank you,'' said the bold lad. ''I'm a lot happier where I
am.''
ONE reason I don't get around much any more is that, thanks to the
nice Mr Murdoch, the household possesses a TV set which spews out all
the whackiest and tackiest sports programmes imaginable.
For some reason, it also gives me half-a-dozen German channels. The
other night, DSF was screening a world title fight.
Some hapless Teuton was being smashed about by a Korean called Yung
Somebody. For three rounds, a dimwit referee allowed him to continue
whilst clearly out on his feet before he finally keeled over. You do
despair about the fight game.
But the real interest lay in the Teuton's boxing trunks which were a
world first. They contained, all over his backside, a splendid advert
for a local garage.
Of course, placing an advert on the backside of any British
heavyweight would simply mean that the advertising industry would have
to produce its lowest rate card in history. But the idea has promise.
You and I might think it represents just about the outer edges of
gross vulgarity but, even as we speak, some ad-man is already shouting
''Eureka'' into his mobile and trying to clinch a deal in this niche
market.
So here's the competition. Rangers decide that they will allow the
backside of their shorts to be available for advertising purposes. What
company, slogan, or logo would be most suitable for inscription on
Gazza's bum?

THE current debate on the distressing condition of Scottish football
at club level is being conducted on a number of false premises, not
least of which is the widely-held assumption that there is a certain,
correct way to play football. This is not true.
None the less, it appears we have been persuaded that the only proper
way to play football is the Continental way. We are not being
successful, we are told, because we are not playing the ''Continental
way'' well enough. This, of course, is true.
Our players are not as technically gifted as the continentals in
certain aspects of the game, it is said. There is apparently, a ''skill
gap.''
I dare say. But there was the same skill gap all those years ago when
Celtic won the European Cup and Rangers the Cup-winners' Cup. The
difference is that Rangers and Celtic, in those days, played to the
strengths of the Scottish game. Nowadays we have been persuaded to play
to other peoples' strengths.
How relieved PSG and Juventus must have been when they came to Glasgow
recently comfortable in the knowledge that they would not have to resist
the direct, aggressive traditional Scottish game which, at its best,
would have put them under terrific pressure.
Instead, they came to give us a football lesson in what they're good
at. And our lads spent the night trying to do what they were doing but
rather badly.
I see no prospect of any permanent improvement in our fortunes if our
clubs continue on this mission impossible. Unless we can change our
climate and geography we cannot provide the sunshine and bone-hard,
billiard table surfaces which produce the touch players we so admire in
European teams.
And even if our top teams filled every position with an assured ball
player there is no certain prospect that they would be able to
effectively use these particular skills through a wet, windy, cold, and
muddy Scottish winter and win our league championship.
I would suggest that the ball in the air has a more certain prospect
of getting there at a slush-covered Brockville in February than any
mistaken attempt to roll the ball about cleverly on the deck.
The real success stories in European football over the past decade, I
would propose, have been that of the small Nordic countries at club and
national level.
It is to Denmark and Norway we should be looking to see what we can do
about our game. And what will we see? We will see them playing a refined
form of what used to be called the British game, based largely on speed,
pace, and athleticism and getting the ball quickly from one end of the
pitch to the other.
There is considerable art in the long-ball game played well. Or have
we forgotten Crerand, Murdoch, and Baxter and their abilities to deliver
the ball with great precision over 70, 80, and even 1000 yards --
changing defence into immediate attack in the process.
These players and the game we used to play were products of the
environment Scotland plays football in. It is reasonable to assume that
success is likelier to be achieved if we play to the strengths this
environment gives us.
We will be sentenced to drubbings forever if we delude ourselves that
we can only succeed against Continental opposition by playing in their
style, which gives them continued advantage against us.
I have been thinking about a new formation that might suit Scottish
teams well.
It has, of course, a goalkeeper. In front of him on the left and right
are two defenders who are charged with not letting the opposition, under
any circumstances, get past them to the bye-line.
There is a large central defender who attacks the ball and is expected
to get to everything in the air. He is flanked by two mobile
ball-winners, one on either side, who make sure anything he misses they
don't. They also carry the ball forward quickly when they get the
opportunity and supplement those in front of them.
Out wide, forward left and right, are two flying machines. They
collect the ball from the defenders and most of the time try to get to
the opposition bye-line. From there, with the rest of the team onside,
they cut the ball back into the middle of the opposition's defence,
creating panic.
In the middle of the attack there's a big chap who creates havoc in
the opposition's defence by running at them and heading crosses
powerfully at the goal.
On either side of him are two fast forwards, one of whom is pretty
good at collecting the ball and skillfully creating chances for his
colleagues, while the other one concentrates on pouncing on half-chances
and banging them into the net.
I think we could call this the 2-3-5 formation. It could revolutionise
our game.

HAVING been involved in youth football for about 36 years, I must
write about the criticism that ''grass roots'' is getting, especially as
it is my opinion that youngsters today are generally more skillful than
when I started because of the amount of dedicated people in youth clubs,
etc, who give up their time to work on these skills.
Last year, our own club went to Denmark and won the Fremad tournament
at under-14 level against 140 teams from more than 30 countries, against
teams who were physically bigger and stronger, and we were congratulated
on the skills and technique of the boys.
The club has played and done well in France, Germany, and Holland . .
. but in one area we find we cannot compete, that is in facilities! Even
the smallest town has a stadium with many pitches, games hall, etc, and
the pitches are grass and vary in size to suit all age groups.
In Lenzie, we do not even have a football ground, and certainly no
games halls. This is where money has to be spent providing good,
plentiful facilities. Young people cannot play in the streets, grass
areas have signs: ''No ball games'' -- no wonder young people get into
trouble and into drugs.
Youth officials in the main do a good job and provide football for a
wide range of youngsters -- not just the cream that the professionals
want -- and they allow them to develop naturally, not trying to coach
all the skills out of them.

Wednesday night.
Having purchased a #30 ticket, I was advised on my arrival that
''there had been duplications'' and that my seat was already taken. I
was required to watch the entire game from a seated position within the

I READ with interest the article by Joanna MacDonald (Sports Herald,
November 6) headed: ''There's smiles all round in sevens heaven,''
regarding the Walker Crisps sponsored Scottish primary school soccer
sevens.
I agree that it is a wonderful innovation for youngsters to be
learning their skills in a relaxed atmosphere without the pressure of
striving to win games at all costs with bickering parents and officials
pressurising them.
However, having managed a leading youth side for 16 years which, in
that era, produced many successful senior players, I would put forward
some relevant points.
Whilst appreciating your writer's suggestion that teams of development
officers should be sent into schools, it is only fair to mention that
the SFA have community officers attached to senior clubs who offer
coaching.
No matter which courses these young boys attend, most of them are
going to finish in the clutches of serious, organised teams playing
11-a-side football, and this is the crux of the problem.
The SFA do not enforce but only encourage seven-a-side football to be
played by the younger lads. Now do you really think that the majority of
officials running youth sides are voluntarily going to forsake
''proper'' competitive, 11-a-side football when there are leagues, cups,
and self-glory to be won?
It is now time for the SFA to make a firm decision and issue a
directive that, commencing from next season, all 11-a-side football is
to be stopped below a designated age level.
There is no doubt that this will be met by resistance from footballing
bodies, and, in particular, they will demand to know who is going to
supply the smaller goalposts, nets, and pitches. This is a problem which
has to be overcome by the SFA liaising with the appropriate council
authorities and youth football officials.
If this is carried out, perhaps in the long term, Scottish football
will obtain some credibility, otherwise with the present haphazard
''grass roots'' set up there is no way back.

IAN Paul (Herald, November 7) writes of the efforts of Rangers
director Donald Findlay, supported by Celtic, to press for an end to the
three foreigners rule in European Football. One important fact seems to
have been overlooked, however, and that is the quality of foreign player
our clubs attract.
While impossible to deny the reputation of Gascoigne, Laudrup, and
Salenko, the fact remains that they had reached a dead-end in their
careers and their options had narrowed.
One is tempted to ask why Rangers, with an apparently bottomless
supply of money, cannot entice players who are more reliable. In
Celtic's case doubt remains about how much in wages they are prepared to
pay, but recent revelations concerning Rangers' failure and Basile
Boli's advice to David Ginola not to join the Parkhead club speaks
volumes about the attitude of foreign players towards the version of
football played in this country.
It is sad but true that most players on the Continent are different
from our variety: they train and practise more and put more thought into
their game. They display greater awareness and are inevitably aware of
the destructive elements present in the modern Scottish game; two games
a week, whirlwind speed, aerial combat, pressure on injured players to
turn out with pain-killing injections, playing in poor weather
conditions, and a larger emphasis on the physical.
Since the advent of the premier division, football has lost something
which the occasional good run in Europe can't disguse. In the sixties we
easily absorbed a host of talented Scandinavian players. Would they fit
in now? The Jan Bartram experience suggests not.
We urgently need a larger top division with teams playing each other
twice. It is ironic that the chief opponents of such a sensible move are
the same people who wish to abandon the three foreigners rule. The time
has come when we should ask those who really matter, the players,
managers, and supporters for their opinions and, for once, listen.

NO-ONE ever suggested it was going to be easy for Scotland to qualify
for the European Championship finals to be played in England next
summer.
Yet here we are, with one foot in the door and qualification to be
confirmed in midweek, even though the Scotland players will have no say
in the matter as they take on the minnows of San Marino at Hampden.
The real difficulty now is trying to work out the various ways the
Scots can be certain that they will be able to enjoy the near month-long
party in June.
The permutations appear endless and, towards the end of last week, I
tried to pin down the European Union and even the Football Association's
Euro '96 organising committee on exactly what is necessary for Scotland
to become one of the qualifying teams without the need of that extra
play-off game at Anfield the week before Christmas.
At their Swiss HQ, a worried spokeswoman insisted: ''We cannot attempt
to say at the moment. There are too many possibilities, too many
countries whose final situation in the qualifying groups is not yet
known.
''There is no way that I would want to try to name the countries who
will be in the play-off games. It is all too confusing.''
In London, another worried lady told me: ''If I started to try to name
the countries who will be playing at Anfield next month, some of them
may take offence. You will just have to work it all out for yourself.''
Well, I explained, I had been looking at the situation very carefully
and it was obvious to me that the country who ended in second place in
Group 6 -- either Austria or the Republic of Ireland -- would have to
take part in the Anfield match. There was no doubt about that, I pointed
out.
''Oh,'' she answered, ''you may be right, but I just don't know. We
will leave it all to UEFA. They worked out the qualification process,
and it is complicated.''
It is, indeed. More complicated than just playing the games and
winning the points it seems.
However, there is light at the end of the tunnel and while UEFA and
the FA failed to provide a guide through the qualifying minefield, at
Park Gardens, the SFA's press officer, David Findlay, had been working
overtime with his calculator providing team manager Craig Brown with the
essential information.
As I had deduced myself, the Republic of Ireland now face failure to
qualify after an astonishing run of success under manager Jack Charlton
in the major competitions.
Indeed, by Wednesday evening, the love affair between the Irish and
Charlton may have ended. The World Cup winner as a player with England
has already indicated that he will go if he fails to reach these finals.
To do so, the Republic must avoid defeat in Portugal this week, while
hoping that their neighbours in the north can defeat Austria in Belfast.
Even if that scenario works out to Charlton's satisfaction, they will
still have the Anfield hurdle to negotiate.
So, there is that one certainty about the play-off -- the Republic or
Austria will be there.
Then we reach the complications where four of the other groups come
into play ahead of Scotland.
In Group 1, the French are under obvious pressure. Their fragile hopes
of avoiding the play-off game rest on, of all countries, Azerbaijan,
rated No.146 in the world rankings, who have still to win a game in
their group and who have lost 29 goals and scored only two in their nine
games so far. Only if they can take points from Poland will the French
go through without the Anfield problem looming for them.
The Scots could know the result of that match before they begin their
own game against San Marino.
In Group 2, if Belgium defeat Cyprus, then that could help propel the
Scots straight into the finals, and the same goes for Group 3, where a
Swedish home win against Turkey would be enough to have Craig Brown
cracking open the champagne for his squad.
There are possibilities in Group 5, too, which could aid the Scots.
Indeed, it would seem that the confidence shown by Brown following the
victory over Finland last month was not misplaced.
The Scotland manager points out: ''It would need a really freakish run
of results to push us into a play-off situation. When you look at how
well we have done against the top four teams in the group, you realise
just how hard our players have worked.
''We lost just one game out of the six which count most towards
qualification, and that was to a very dodgy penalty in the game against
Greece in Athens last December. We beat Finland twice, beat the Greeks
here at Hampden and we drew with Russia, who will be among the
favourites for the title, both in Glasgow and in Moscow.
''Eleven points from these six games was a figure I would have
accepted when the draw was made. Looking at the other groups, I cannot
see all the results going against us. That would be almost impossible.''
It would, but then we are talking about the Scottish international
team here, and when have things ever gone according to plan in any of
their various campaigns over the years?
And so Brown waits and wonders and worries about results scattered
across Europe which may make or break his summer.

THE Galleon Centre in Kilmarnock is always a welcome venue to visit,
not least because it is well funded by the Kilmarnock and Loudoun
District Council. I am not merely giving a puff for a civic authority
here; I am glad to do so. Sport needs all the funding it can get,
especially when it is minority and specialist.
Provost Danny was there on Saturday night, welcoming the local
Kilmarnock volleyball club and their opponents from Luxembourg, VC
Petange, and his council had put #4500 into Scottish volleyball this
year, and five grand for European efforts. Well, after all, volleyball
is very much a growing sport.
Growing enough for 350 tickets to be sold at the Galleon on Saturday
night. Just last month there were more than 500 spectators at the Kelvin
Hall watching Norway lose to Glasgow's Su Ragazzi.
What made Saturday's match important, though, was that it was the
first time Kilmarnock could play in any of the three major European club
competitions, the return leg of which will take place in Luxembourg next
Sunday, with the winning team travelling to Portugal in early December
to play in a four-team round-robin tournament. The other teams for
Portugal hail from the home country itself, either Albania or Hungary,
and Israel.
This was a good draw for Killie, a sizeable club with two men's and a
women's team, and a considerable amount of work being done with
youngsters. Kilmarnock has done well to reach such heights.
Talking of heights, Killie easily outreached the Luxembourgers with
Steven Jackson at 2.06 metres tall and Gordon Welsh at 2.00 metres. What
metres measure I know not, but the lads were big.
Also they seemed to have rather more ability in blocking the ball --
to the uninitiated that means when the players manage to stop some
marvellously vivid volley from being a scoring shot.
Killie's powerful Alan Thomas was deadly in his serve -- deadly enough
to destroy Luxembourg in the first set by 15-10. This was reversed in
the second, with Luxembourg winning that 15-12, probably helped by a wee
talk with their head of delegation, doctor and player himself from time
to time, Luc Watry.
He claimed that his best player, Romanian internationalist Groza
Adrien, was missing from his team because of bureaucracy. Well it is
Luxembourg where they make all these EC decisions and the like.
Whether it was the missing Adrien or not, Killie ploughed through
their visitors' defence to take the next two sets 15-4, 15-6, and win
the first leg.
There was, as I have said, a sizeable crowd for a dark, dreich, night
in Kilmarnock. Many of the crowd were involved in the sport themselves,
including PE teacher Susan Orr and her two children, Lesley and Douglas,
who plays for his secondary school in Prestwick. Dad John, I recollect,
is a teacher in Mearns Castle School in Glasgow, renowned for its keen
interest in the game, and which, in fact, supplied pupils for the
floor-wiping. I am not sure how I spent my Saturday nights as a
teenager, but I am convinced it wasn't with wiping floors in Kilmarnock.
The kids must be keen.
I spoke also to Killie's physiotherapist, Kirsty Arbuthnott, who takes
the disabled teams in Scotland, and she was pleased with the Ayrshire
side's achievements in the last few years. ''The early 90's we did very
well, winning the league and cup, but though we tailed off a bit we will
be back now, and don't forget,'' she said, ''we have 11 Sottish
internationalists in the club, including Jim McKenna with 75 caps, and
David McCrae with 80 appearances for the international disabled squad.''
But the first person I spoke to was none other than the captain of
Killie himself, the aforementioned internationalist, Jim McKenna.
Unlike many another sport, the great man didn't mind talking to me
just before the game. In fact he had to get called away. A pleasant
experience meeting somebody playing a game which, no matter how
important, didn't mean he had to get hyped up to levels of
psychopathology.
And another thing. The last time I was at volleyball, it was in Perth,
where the sports centre was astonishingly inhospitable. Well, the
Galleon wasn't like that at all. Thanks for the dram, Monsieur Watry of
Luxembourg. I'll bring a bottle the next time I'm there.

* STUNNED by two late call-offs -- Tom Murray and Ian Brown --
Scotland surprised the opposition by finishing second in a seven-nation
international cross-country event yesterday at Margate.
Robert Quinn (Kilbarchan) put himself in contention for a European
cross-country championship place by placing third (22-16) with Murray's
replacement, Steven Wylie (Cambuslang) fourth in 22-21, and Chris
Robison, (Spango Valley) fifteenth, in 23-05.
The race, final official trial for the Alnwick event a fortnight on
Saturday, was won by England's David Taylor in 22min 04sec, with
team-mate Keith Udhal runner-up in 22-14.
Murray, by withdrawing on Wednesday, gave sufficient time for Wylie to
be drafted in, but Brown, by delaying until 12 hours before departure,
gave no time for a replacement, and the flight cost was forfeit.

MEN'S HOCKEY
GRAHAM Joyce made a dynamic return to the Western side on Saturday
after suspension by scoring a hat trick in their 5-2 defeat of Torbrex
Wanderers, but then spoiled an almost flawless performance by picking up
another yellow card.
The Scotland under-21 internationalist has been showing greater
maturity this season, but has to realise that umpires are not
infallible. Once he learns this elementary lesson, Scotland's search for
a striker for the national side will be over.
Western were superior to Wanderers in all aspects of the game and
might have hit double figures but for some brilliant goalkeeping by
Kevin Farnan.
Touche Ross Gordonians, who dispute third place with the Glasgow side,
were just one goal off that target against Pender Uddingston. Among
their goalscorers was new recruit Adam Smith who, like Richard Freeland
and Paul Doney, scored twice in their 9-0 victory.
Leaders Grange hit Clydesdale for six without reply. Donald MacFarlane
masterminded their success, scoring his first hat trick of the season to
bring his goal tally for the campaign to 11.
Grange retain their one-point advantage over Menzieshill. They, too,
picked up maximum points, winning 4-3 against Ciba Kelburne, but it was
a close call in the end for they conceded goals to Michael Starling and
Craig Watkins in the final quarter.
Andrew Kay once again proved to be MIM's match-winner in their tussle
with Insights Inverleith. They lost the opening goal to a penalty from
Kerr Thomson but scores by Gavin Markham and Kay ensured them of a
fourth successive victory.

WOMEN'S HOCKEY
HYNDLAND'S unbeaten record was destroyed on Saturday when league
leaders Western Klick Photopoint disposed of them 2-0, but they bounced
back yesterday to beat Selkirk in brilliant style in the cup.
They gave the Borderers a lesson in the art of goal-scoring, running
out 13-1 winners, with seven of their players getting their names on the
scoresheet.
This reversal completed a miserable weekend for Selkirk, who were
beaten 2-0 in the second division 24 hours earlier by Melrose, who
completed the double yesterday by beating first-division Boroughmuir by
the odd goal in three.
Aberdeen Bon Accord, who currently hold a one-point advantage over
Melrose at the top of the second division, have also advanced to the
quarter-finals of the cup. They knocked out Carmuirs 4-0, with Dutch
player Pauline De Konin hitting a double.
Western, winners of the title for the past seven years, made short
work of Heriot-Watt University 9-0. Ellen Murray bounced back to scoring
form, picking up a hat trick, as did Sheena McKelvie. Sandra Chalmers
also scored a treble, for Menzieshill in their victory over Dundee
University.
Lynn Forsyth twice found the target for Kelburne against Grove's
second string but it was not enough to give the Paisley side victory.
The game ended in a 2-2 draw, with the Taysiders winning 3-2 in the
penalty shoot-out.
Rhona Simpson and Susan McDonald scored Britain's goals in their final
practice match against Korea before the start of the Olympic qualifying
tournament in Cape Town on Wednesday. But the Koreans won 3-2.

SATURDAY'S eight ties in the first round of the Keyline MacAulay Cup
produced no fewer than 50 goals, with only Oban Celtic, the bottom team
in the national premier league, failing to find the net.
North first-division side Lochaber produced the upset of the day,
accounting for premier-league side Glenurquhart 4-2 after having led 3-0
on the half-hour. Two superb strikes by Andrew MacDonald and another by
John Delaney had put Lochaber firmly in the driving seat, and then Peter
MacDonald had a goal chalked off for the visitors. He was to be
instrumental in a fight-back which almost saw Lochaber squander a
three-goal advantage for the second week running. MacDonald scored one
on each side of the interval to bring the Glen back into the game but
substitute Neil MacDonald put the match beyond their reach in 74
minutes.
Strathglass came nearest to emulating Lochaber's feat by holding the
much fancied Fort William to a 2-2 draw, with all four goals coming in
the first half. Dereck Cameron had both Fort's goals and Calum MacArthy
both for the visitors. Newtonmore await the outcome.
They had their second successive morale-building win against
first-division opposition, with Colin Stewart again among the goals. He
bagged a hat trick in the 7-2 win, with Allan MacRae scoring twice for
Lovat, who had James MacKenzie sent off.
Cup holders Oban Camanachd made light work of Ballachulish. Gordon
MacIntyre's rehabilitation continues apace, with the international
defender turned forward scoring in his second successive match since
returning from the loss of an eye two months ago. He faces the stiffest
test of his comeback when Oban Camanachd meet Newtonmore this weekend in
a rescheduled premier league match, the only one lost so far to the
weather.
Cup favourites Kingussie coasted past Skye in Portree, winning 9-2,
although they were two down to Duncan MacDougall goals in the early
stages.
Kyles Athletic comfortably disposed of Glenorchy at home and now play
host to Inveraray, who defeated Tayforth 4-1.
On the schools front, the first of the national competitions, the Wade
Cup for under-16 players was won by Charleston Academy from Inverness.
They beat Oban High School in a thrilling final at Canal Parks, Caol.
Charleston were playing in their first schools' cup final.

TOMMY Yule, national under-17 1500 metres champion indoor and out, led
Park Mains High School to a 20-second victory in the TSB Scottish
Schools Road Relay Championships at Grangemouth -- the latest in a long
line of successes they have brought to the Erskine school.
Yule and David Greig -- they topped last year's Scottish 3000m
rankings in their age-group -- along with Alistair McLeod, finished
clear of Balfron High, repeating a win which the same three boys
achieved in this event at under-15 level three years ago. Next spring
the trio will be bidding for their fourth successive schools
cross-country team title, having won once at under-15 and twice at
under-17.
All three are members of Kilbarchan, and in their colours won last
weekend's Nike Young athletes' event at Bellahouston.
Balfron were one of three medal-winning teams to field twins (Alistair
and Graeme Reid), along with St Aloysius', the under-15 champions, and
Boclair Academy, third in the under-15 girls' event.
The Hazletons, Lewis and Gerard, who have a sporting pedigree which
includes brown belts in karate and playing rugby for West of Scotland,
helped St Aloysius' beat Ayr's Queen Margaret Academy by half-a-minute,
while the Ross twins, Joanna and Morag, snatched bronze for Boclair,
whose team had been last after a fall by their opening runner, Serena
Kay, at the start.
George Watson's won the under-15 event, and Inverkeithing High took
the over-15 title by 35 seconds, largest winning margin of the day, with
a team which included Pitreavie's outstanding prospect Hannah Norman,
the East District 1500m champion. Details:
Boys. Under-15: 1, St Aloysius' College (L Hazleton, J McFadden, G

EXACTLY 20 years after the last victory in the event by his
illustrious father, Lachie Stewart's son Glen won the Glasgow University
Road race yesterday, clocking 22min 18sec, exactly the same as last
year, when he was fourth.
Stewart, of Leslie Deans Racing Club, finished 12 seconds clear of
Cambuslang's international steeplechaser Graeme Croll, with former
national cross-country champion Tom Murray third in 22-50.
That trio broke clear soon after the start, reaching two miles
together in 8-49.
Murray, not fit enough to tackle an international race in Margate, was
first to weaken soon after, but it was not until inside the final mile
of the 4.8-mile trail that the former Commonwealth champion's son broke
clear.
Murray has opted out of his club's Edinburgh-Glasgow relay team for
next week, but the two others will be key figures in their respective
clubs' battle for the medals.
Audrey Sym (City of Glasgow), with a string of second places to her
credit, won the women's race in 26-44, from Janette Stevenson and Sandra
Branney.
The Jim Bogan Trophy for the first student went to Malcom Bain in
24-18.
* SUE Ridley, with 800 metres internationalists Mary McClung and Carol
Sharp to back her, helped Edinburgh Woollen Mill win the second round of
the Scottish Women's Cross-country League at Lasswade yesterday.
Details:
Men (6 miles): 1, A Russell (Law) 30-21; 2, K Lyall 31-00; 3, I Veitch
(both Leslie Deans RC) 31-02. Veteran: J Hanlon (Dundee HH) 33-48.
Junior: S Kennedy (Cambuslang) 31-54. Team: 1, FMC Carnegie 20pts; 2,

A SURVEY, which for the first time specifically charts the depths of
Scotland's athletics decline, spanning more than a decade, yesterday
became the catalyst for helping launch a new vision for the sport.
A two-day Scottish Athletics Federation conference, which met at
Stirling University to debate the conclusions of a Scottish Sports
Council-funded review, was presented with such damning evidence that
anticipated opposition to a radical restructuring of the sport was swept
aside.
In 1970, the year in which Edinburgh hosted the Commonwealth Games for
the first time, 11 Scots gained top-three UK ranking in male and female
events. This was viewed as the dawn of a golden age for the sport in
Scotland, and not once in more than a decade did we ever drop below that
figure of 11. Indeed, for six successive years, there were at least 16
in the top three. Yet not once since 1981 have more than 11 made the
grade.
In the 10 years from 1986, the number of top-three UK-ranked Scots has
been as follows: 5, 9, 9, 4, 10, 8, 8, 4, 6 7. This reads as a damning
indictment of the way in which coaching of performance athletes has been
approached.
The conference concluded that the role of national coach Andy Vince,
and predecessor David Lease, has been too wide for one person.
The survey was the trump card played by Alastair Gray, the consultant
responsible for conducting the review, and whose similar exercises for
hockey and swimming have already led to sweeping changes in these
sports.
It was agreed unanimously that a new structure should be adopted. The
self-analysis was painful, with no aspect of the sport escaping
unscathed. But the outcome was a series of positive measures, which, if
approved, will streamline the sport, eliminate bureaucracy, giving
greater autonomy to individual disciplines, and change athletics
forever.
Among the ideas proposed is a significant new appointment at the top:
director of athletics, to whom everyone, including the national coach,
would be answerable. Even office bearers, such as secretary, treasurer,
and president, may be advertised in future, with competitive interviews
being conducted.
Swimming voted 188-0 when a similar radical deal was spelled out to
them, and hockey was astounded when the dinosaurs of that sport also
voted 100% in favour of change. The crunch will come for athletics when
the package is laid before the clubs at an extraordinary general meeting
to be held next May or June.
First, the SAF council will digest the details of the conference, and
agree the proposals. They will set up working parties to refine the
detail, and have a series of road shows to explain the proposals to
clubs. The annual meeting will be used to explain the outline, but will
not debate details. That will be left until the extraordinary meeting.
Financial restructuring will be required, with sweeping new
self-funding initiatives being introduced with the aim of doubling the
current income by way of Scottish Sports Council grant.
These are likely to include a new membership scheme, providing a data
base of all members, and recognition of under-11 competitors who are
being seduced early into other sports. It was agreed that athletics in
Scotland is mediocre, with not readily marketable qualities.
Gray concludes that, without surgery, the sport could soon be
insolvent. Reserves of #71,232 in November 1993 had fallen to #18,218 a
year ago.
* PAUL Evans, the Glasgow-born former Springburn Harrier who rejected
his Scottish nationality, yesterday just failed to win the New York
Marathon by less than five seconds to German Silva. The Mexican, who
also won last year, clocked 2-11-00.
Kenyan Tecla Loroupe, also winner last year, won the women's race,
first to do so twice in succession since Liz McColgan's coach, Grete
Waitz, in 1985. Loroupe broke clear at 17 miles, winning in 2-28-06 from
World and European champion Manuela Machado of Portugal. Result:
Men: 1, G Silva (Mex) 2-11-00; 2, P Evans (GB) 2-11-05; 3, W Koech
(Kenya) 2-11-19. Women: 1, T Loroupe (Kenya) 2-28-06; 2, M Machado (Por)
2-30-37; 3, L Slegers (Bel) 2-32-08.
Tinto Hill Race (4[1/2] miles/1500 feet): 1, J Brooks (Lochaber) 29-58
(record); 2, G Barlett (Forres) 29-59; 3, A Kitchin (Livingston) 30-58.
Veteran: L Turnbull (Carnethy, fifteenth) 35-31. Team: Carnethy. Women:
1, A Mudge (Carnethy, 16th) 36-32; 2, J Salvona (Livingston) 40-57; 3,
A-M Hughes (Shettleston) 41-50. Veteran: G Paul (Carnethy) 51-37.

AFTER a good start Scotland's bowlers had to settle for third place at
the close of the opening day in the inaugural European Indoor Team
Championships in Jersey yesterday, two points behind joint-leaders
Ireland and Wales, and on the same points mark as England and Jersey.
The Scots, after winning three of their opening four matches against
Guernsey, looked poised to finish the day as leaders, but suffered
defeat by Ireland's men last night in both pairs and triples.
Hugh Duff and David Gourlay, who had earlier coasted to a 21-11 win
against Ian Merrien and Adrian Welch, found a tricky rink and the strong
Irish pairing of Jeremy Henry and Noel Graham too hot and tumbled to a
24-10 defeat. But the triples team looked set to offset that as Willie
Galloway, Graham Robertson, and Angus Blair led Gary McCloy's side 14-5
with just three ends to play.
Unbelievably, however, the Scots dropped a 5 and then a 3 to be only
one up playing the last, and a double gave Ireland an unlikely 15-14
victory.
The Scots' triples side also had watched an 13-10 lead disappear
against Guernsey, who hit back to win 21-14 earlier in the day. Results:
Men. Pairs -- Scotland 32, Guernsey 11; Jersey 17, Ireland 16; Wales
25, England 17; England 21, Guernsey 14; Wales 21, Jersey 18; Ireland
24, Scotland 10.
Triples -- Guernsey 21, Scotland 14; Ireland 28, Jersey 6; Wales 15,
England 13; Scotland 21, Wales 11; England 19, Guernsey 9; Ireland 15,
Scotland 14.
Women. Pairs -- Scotland 25, Guernsey 14; Ireland 23, Jersey 13; Wales

FIFE Flyers looked to this weekend's double header to underline their
improved performance level, but it ended up as a big disappointment with
two straight defeats.
Randy Smith fired home with three minutes left to give Cardiff Devils,
the premier division league leaders, a narrow 7-6 victory before a full
house in the Principality on Saturday. Canadian Chris Palmer had scored
four times for the Scots.
But Flyers failed to find any real form last night when they went down
tamely 8-3 at Humberside Hawks. Cardiff, meanwhile, surprisingly lost
6-3 at Basingstoke.
Elsewhere, Paisley Pirates disposed of division one strugglers
Solihull Barons 7-2 on Saturday, but slipped up badly last night when
they let a 6-3 lead with 18 minutes left disappear to lose 7-6 to Medway
Bears.
Pirates' goaltender Dave Rook and his opposite number, Russ Jackson,
were both thrown out after a fracas in 42 minutes and the English side
took full advantage.
Dumfries Vikings bounced back, after having been stung 10-6 at
Bracknell Bees on Saturday, to win 8-6 at Guildford Flames.
But Murrayfield Royals had to be content with a single point from two
home games when they drew 10-10 with Solihull Barons last night, despite
leading 9-6 going into the final period. Medway Bears mauled Royals 9-6
in the capital on Saturday. Results:
Saturday: Premier division -- Cardiff 7, Fife 6; Milton Keynes 8,
Durham 2; Sheffield 8, Slough 2. Division 1 -- Bracknell 10, Dumfries 6;
Murrayfield 6, Medway 9; Paisley 7, Solihull 2; Swindon 14, Peterborough
3.
Yesterday: Premier division -- Basingstoke 6, Cardiff 3; Durham 6,
Newcastle 2; Humberside 8, Fife 3; Slough 3, Nottingham 8. Division 1 --
Guildford 6, Dumfries 8; Murrayfield 10, Solihull 10; Paisley 6, Medway
7; Billingham 5, Bracknell 14; Blackburn 16, Peterborough 1; Chelmsford
6; Swindon 9; Manchester 9; Telford 5.

ENGLAND'S hot and bothered cricketers are facing another roasting --
from Ray Illingworth. They slumped to a six-wicket defeat by South
Africa A yesterday as temperatures topped 100[DEG]F.
But if Mike Atherton's team thought that was warm, Illingworth is
likely to turn up the heat tonight while running through a game that has
done nothing to alter England's rating as underdogs for Thursday's first
Test.
''I think they'll understand what we mean,'' said the manager when
asked just how critical he intended to be. ''I'm not satisfied with what
has happened here.''
England were bowled out for 308 and 309 on a pitch that remained flat
throughout. Left-arm wrist spinner Paul Adams, aged 18, had a match haul
of nine for 181.
Devon Malcolm almost saved England by scoring an undefeated 48 off 45
balls. South Africa A needed 148 to win off 43 overs. They made it with
25 deliveries to spare.
* NASSER Hussain played another innings of great authority in Pakistan
yesterday to further boost both his own Test prospects and the tour
hopes of his England A side.
Hussain hit a three-hour 83, his fourth score above 50 in four tour
innings, while Jason Gallian's 67 from 90 balls with 12 fours helped
England A reply with 199 for five to a Pakistan Cricket Board XI's 301
all out.
* LEG-spinner Narendra Hirwani made a dazzling come-back by capturing
six for 59 in the third and final Test against New Zealand in Cuttack as
India took the series 1-0. The rain-ruined match ended in a draw on the
fifth and final day with New Zealand making 175 for eight declared in
reply to India's first-innings score of 296 for eight declared.

WORLD champions South Africa warmed up for next Saturday's clash with
England at Twickenham with an unconvincing 40-21 victory over Italy in
Rome's Olympic stadium yesterday.
The South Africans were playing their first away match since the World
Cup and took a 17-6 half-time lead, although they looked in desperate
trouble in the second half, when the Italians hit back with two tries to
lead 21-17.
The shock was short-lived as the visitors, playing Italy for the first
time, moved up a gear to clinch the win, but there was little in their
game to alarm England ahead of next weekend's much-awaited clash.
* PHIL de Glanville, captain of Courage League One leaders Bath, and
Dean Richards, leader of dejected trailers Leicester, have differing
views on the impact of Saracens' shock win over the Tigers on Saturday.
The upset of the season -- Saracens won 25-21 -- left Leicester
trailing four points behind Bath, and Richards said: ''The League is as
good as over.''
Bath need to lose three times and Leicester must win all of their
remaining games if the current leaders are to be toppled.
But de Glanville, whose team toiled to put away winless West
Hartlepool 34-22, said: ''Last January we were three points clear of
Leicester but we dropped eight points in our last seven matches and
gifted the title to Leicester. So, despite our leading position, we are
not counting on anything.''
The big winners of the day were homely north Londoners, Saracens, who
had #2.5m injected into the club by local millionaire entrepreneur Nigel
Wray at the start of the week.
David Pears' goal-kicking frailties for Harlequins allowed Orrell also
to improve their position in the lower regions with another 25-21 win.
Wasps finally won a match after the departure of Rob Andrew in the
middle of last month, victory at Bristol giving them every prospect of
finishing in the top four and qualification for lucrative European
involvement. After sacking Andrew, Wasps lost twice and still do not
know the verdict on their abandoned match against West Hartlepool.
Gloucester turned over two-thirds of a losing team for their trip to
Sale without turning round their long sequence of defeats. Sale won
21-13 and Gloucester are now facing the prospect of relegation along
with West Hartlepool.

PREMIERSHIP III leaders Glasgow Academicals played as though their
attention was more on events in Fife, where Kirkcaldy took on Biggar,
than on the Anniesland pitch and immediate opponents Preston Lodge. A
win for Biggar would have seen Accies promoted, but Kirkcaldy's 21-10
success means that Accies could still be caught by both clubs.
However, the best points difference in the premiership surely means
Accies can book one of the places in the elevator.
The simultaneous arrival of rain and the kick-off adversely affected
Accies with their fingertip passing style. PL, particularly in the
person of centre John Webber, showed what direct running could achieve.
After the teams turned at 3-3, he played his part in setting up PL
pressure which all but brought a try.
Instead, Calum MacGregor's quick rugby brain transformed dropped
possession in his 22 to pressure on the visitors' line. Two penalties
were run, with Stuart Simmers squeezing over from the ruck induced by
the second.
MacGregor converted and went on to take his penalty count to three
before Matt Begley touched down from a try on PL's line. The visitors,
however, forced the last word with a nice try involving Neil Clyde twice
in the build-up before Mark McDonald touched down.
With Kirkcaldy taking the wrong options, Biggar got on top in the
first half and thoroughly deserved their 10-0 lead. Denis Lavery kicked
an early penalty and converted Ewan McAlpine's try. However, Kirkcaldy's
John Mitchell kicked two penalties near half-time and a third soon after
the pause.
When Kirkcaldy ran a penalty near Biggar's line, the defence twice
held but finally flanker Stuart Hannah scored under the bar for Mitchell
to convert. The Fifers' discipline in a rugged encounter then held
better and near the end, as Biggar moved possession in their 22, the
home side secured loose possession for Hannagh again to touch down for a
21-10 Kirkcaldy win.
With Grangemouth winning 25-16 at relegated Corstorphine, it's any one
of three for the other spot. Corstorphine led 11-3 at the turn and
produced the try of the game through Euan McDonald. However,
Grangemouth, with five members of Central Region constabulary on duty,
scored tries through one of them, Tony Howard, plus Sandy Penman, and
Corrie Kennet.
Grangemouth now have a vital meeting with Musselburgh, who went under
at home 22-13 to Peebles. The Borderers scored tries through Chris
Flannery, Davie Gray, and Steven Claperton, with Andre Bell kicking a
penalty and two conversions. Musselburgh's try came from Andy McLeod,
with Neil Lockhart converting and kicking two penalties.

KILMARNOCK'S home win over Langholm, their eleventh in 12 starts,
brought them promotion. Playing against the wind initially, they led
only 9-0 at the turn -- three penalties from Phil Gordon. Thereafter
they found the way to the line three times for tries from Robbie
Stewart, Robin Carswell, and Dougie Campbell, who touched down for the
first time in his career.
With Gordon converting Campbell's try, Killie got home 26-0.
Glasgow Southern remain favourites to accompany Kilmarnock, having
negotiated successfully their visit to Edinburgh Wanderers. The hosts,
who remain favourites to accompany Wigtownshire out of the Premiership,
once again gave a good account of themselves, leading 9-6 thanks to Carl
McWilliam's third penalty early in the second half. However, Southern
came through thanks to James Dunlop extending his penalty count to four
in the final 15 minutes.
Southern now face two tricky fixtures: Kilmarnock away and Ayr at
home. If anyone is to catch them it can only be Gordonians, who, in yet
another bruising battle, beat Ayr 19-6 at Countesswells.
Even with the wind behind them it took Gordonians to the 20-minute
mark before Bruce Doney nudged them ahead with a penalty. Craig Foster
evened the score with a penalty five minutes later. However, Doney moved
Gordonians ahead again with a penalty and then produced the half-time
lead of 13-3.
The break for the try was made by Australian fly-half Kane Barrie,
with Doney going over and converting. Two Doney penalties to one for
Foster completed the scoring.
Haddington broke a six-game losing streak in style -- a 60-0 triumph
over doomed Wigtownshire, with right winger Callum Murray touching down
no fewer than five times. George Gow had a brace and both Brian Craig
and Scott Brown touched down once, while the try of the match was
rounded off by Phil Hodgson, who converted exactly half of the 10 tries.
* HARRY BASSI, the GHK centre-cum-full back, has been called up by
Glasgow to make his district debut against Griqualand West at Hughenden
this evening (kick-off 7 o'clock) after the withdrawal yesterday of his
club colleague, George Breckenridge, who has a heavily bruised right
calf.
Bassi's place among the replacements has gone to Alan Bulloch, the
West of Scotland centre, who was a Scottish Schools cap last season.
Revised team:
Craig Sangster (Stirling County); Torquil Mathewson (Glasgow
Academicals), Andrew Garry (Watsonians), Chris Simmers (Edinburgh
Academicals), Harry Bassi (GHK); Calum MacGregor (Glasgow Academicals),
Fraser Stott (West of Scotland); John Gibson (Stirling County), Gordon
Bulloch (West of Scotland), Gordon McIlwham (GHK), Matt Begley (Glasgow
Academicals), Malcolm Norval (Stirling County), Fergus Wallace

* VETERAN lightweight Joanna Morgan ended the Flat racing season in
Ireland on a high note yesterday by taking the November Handicap on Noel
Meade's Rogerdor.
Bought from Guy Harwood three years ago, Rogerdor followed up a recent
success in an amateur Flat event at Galway when holding on by a head
from Andante, both of them competing from out of the handicap.
Morgan, 40, and the mother of two, recovered from a broken hip in
April to ride six winners this year, inclusive of three premier
handicaps and a Listed race.
The overall honours of the season, though, went to John Oxx and John
Murtagh, who each became champion for the first time, and closed on the
home front with an all-the-way success for Deynawari in the Eyrefield
Stakes.

THE crowd came to Ayr to see One Man, and the flying grey didn't let
them down, jumping superbly in the hands of Tony Dobbin to win the Sean
Graham Motherwell Chase at his ease.
The destination of the #7700 first prize was never in doubt from the
moment One Man took the lead in front of Ayr's almost complete new
stands. He then proceeded to demolish the opposition, including former
Cheltenham Gold Cup champion, Jodami.
An attempted challenge by the older, more experienced chaser fizzled
out two from home, and despite the efforts of Mark Dwyer, Jodami could
make no impression and trailed in seven lengths behind the winner.
At 8-11, One Man offered little value to most punters but the big boys
piled in, and bets ranging from #500 to #2000 were recorded.
After the race, Gordon Richards confirmed that One Man's next
engagement is at Newbury in two weeks, when the seven-year-old will
attempt to repeat last year's triumph in the Hennessy Gold Cup. He is
quoted at 2-1 for that race.
If all goes well he will go for the King George VI Chase at Kempton on
Boxing Day and the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March, for which he is the 8-1
second favourite.
Richards is baffled as to why One Man came a cropper last time out in
the Racing Post Chase at Kempton in February. ''He never rose to jump
the fence. Why, we'll never know,'' he said. Since he came back this
season, Richards has schooled him over fences 50 or 60 times and hopes
that has done the trick.
The trainer produced six winners over three days' racing at Kelso and
Ayr, but his stable jockey did even better.
Dobbin, on the 29 mark, had seven firsts, five for his main retainer
and two for Peter Monteith.
A typically aggressive ride allowed him to get Monteith's Done Well,
the 2-1 favouite, home in the Sean Graham Sporting Life Juvenile Hurdle.
Done Well, who has the distinction of finishing second to Pennekamp on
the Flat in France, led two flights out and appeared to be sensing
victory. Phophets Honour came back at him, and only a supreme effort
from Dobbin kept the favourite in front.
This was Monteith's twelfth winner, putting him eight successes clear
of his nearest rivals in The Herald Scottish Trainers' Championship and
10 ahead of title favourite, Len Lungo, who went home empty-handed.
Sparky Gayle is highly regarded by trainer Colin Parker and owner
Raymond Green, but neither dared to believe the five-year-old, carrying
12st, could win first time out. The 14-1 chance made up a considerable
distance in the home straight to ''pinch'' the Irvine Handicap Hurdle on
the line from Abbot of Furness, who had looked home and dry.
Selkirk farmer Rayson Nixon, who renewed his permit in July after a
break of 10 years, saw his home-bred eight-year-old Political Tower land
the Sean Graham Barrhead Handicap Chase when the 4-6 shot, Wee River,
blundered at the last.
* CONNECTIONS of Rough Quest, being aimed at the Cheltenham Gold Cup,
reported him still on target for the Hennessy despite a weekend fall at
Cheltenham.
''He's fine despite the fall,'' said trainer Terry Casey yesterday.
''In fact, he's fresh this morning, if anything.''

Stewart's Melville FP 11,
West of Scotland 25
THE big question around Inverleith as the gloom descended was: where
have all the rugby fans gone?
On a day which saw just two Premiership games going on in the capital,
the crowd which chose to take in this clash was a huge disappointment.
And the news for those who chose to miss out is that this was not a
bad game at all.
Colleges needed a win badly and West wanted to improve their position
but, despite the pressure and the poor conditions, the teams served up
some enjoyable rugby.
There was a battle royal in the lineout, which Bill Faulds and Mark
Paton just edged over young Scott McKechnie and Guy Perrett.
The duel between two (whisper it) veteran stand-offs in Douglas Wyllie
and David Barrett was also intriguing and even in defeat the
international player was ahead.
Both Colleges and West have to build next season and try to keep their
youngsters together. The Inverleith faithful will be hoping that a
little more club loyalty emerges next season than has been evident in
this.
Gordon Bulloch, playing another blinder save for some slack
throwing-in, opened the scoring with a try converted by Barrett, who
also provided the neat inside pass.
Within a minute the stand-off turned from hero to villain as his slow
clearance kick was charged down by Nick Penny, who gathered and crossed
for a try.
Two penalty goals apiece from Graeme Stirling and Barrett gave West a
slender advantage at the break, on which they improved through a David
Riding try after waves of attack.
Further such waves pinned Colleges back on their line and Gordon
Bulloch's second try had to come. Barrett added goal points.
Neither of these sides is a great one, but one feels that with a
mixture of hard work, maturity, and loyalty, they will not be long in
becoming very good.

Kelso 13, GHK 16
WITH a team like GHK constantly confounding the pundits, who would be
a betting man? After a horrendous start to their league campaign, GHK
now find themselves in the position where, with two matches remaining,
they could -- if Jed-Forest take careful aim at their own feet -- win
promotion.
It was a win but not a day on which GHK could express their talents to
the full. ''We are much more of a dry weather side. The wet conditions
do not allow us to use our fast back division,'' said Andy Little, the
GHK director of coaching, who would have recognised that it was the
accurate kicking of John McLeod and the work of the back five that won
the day for his side.
As for Kelso, their resurgence has suffered something of a setback,
but they will be annoyed with themselves for the manner in which they
lost on Saturday.
Kelso have only themselves to blame for their narrow defeat.
Their performance in the first quarter, when they moved the ball well,
drove round the fringes, and kicked sensibly brought quick rewards --
two penalty goals by Graeme Aitchison and a fine try by Gordon Laing
under the posts from a penalty in which No.8 David Rankine played a key
role.
Thereafter GHK were allowed to take control, Murray Wallace opening
their scoring from a free kick quickly taken by Cameron Little and
carried on by Cecil du Plessis.
This try just before half-time proved to be the beginning of the end
for Kelso. The Borderers adopted a touchline strategy which elicited
nothing short of gratitude from a GHK pack operating with super
efficiency at the lineout.
GHK were not slow to take advantage. First Breckenridge kicked a
penalty goal and then a close-range try from du Plessis brought the
scores level. The final nail, however, was left until injury time,
Breckenridge, who had earlier missed five attempts at goal, putting over
a difficult kick to give GHK victory. Not a day for a betting man.
Kelso -- G Aitchison; S Ross, G Laing, B Manion, J Thomson; S Tait, I

Dundee HS FP 16,
Jed-Forest 17
THE Dundee fans may think they are suffering from permanent deja vu.
But unfortunately it is all too realistic. Their team led at half-time,
but still went down fighting by the narrowest of margins. And that is
the fifth time it has happened this season.
At least on this occasion there can be no castigation of the players.
Their effort was immense.
The turning point in the game came in the fifty-seventh minute when
Jed were trailing 16-7 and Dundee were looking good. But Jed manoeuvered
close to the home line and were awarded a scrum. It collapsed after two
attempts and Dundee were adjudged to have taken it down.
Referee Jim Fleming, having warned both packs, had to award a penalty
try. Chris Richards duly converted to put the Borderers only three
points in arrears.
Although Dundee hit back territorially again, a huge kick by Gareth
Scott put them in trouble and inevitably, they drifted offside, leaving
Richards to slot an easy penalty and put Jed in the driving seat and
very much closer to promotion.
Chris Robinson put Dundee ahead in five minutes with a penalty but
Jed's back row was starting to take its toll and a try followed in 20
minutes, Clark Laidlaw nipping in from a pass from skipper Ron
Kirkpatrick.
Dundee deservedly got back into the game with a try from Paul Rouse.
It came from a superb burst by Alan Featherstone, who was held up under
the posts. However, the ball was worked back and Rouse was put in by
Robinson.
The fly-half stretched the lead to 11-7 at the interval with a penalty
and 11 minutes into the second half Dundee's outstanding forward Derek
Milne touched down following splendid work from Gavin Scott,
Featherstone, and Jon Petrie.
The unfortunate scrum incident followed not long after, and from then
Dundee were chasing the game.

Edinburgh Academicals 15, Melrose 18
THE recipe for a row was placed on the table. Academicals, bravely
defending a slender lead, lost out to a try in the fifth minute of
injury time following six successive penalties awarded against them by
referee Colin Henderson. It is a result which, unless there is league
reconstruction, could send them to the second division.
And they were not best pleased. Former Scotland captain David Sole,
now the forwards' coach at Raeburn Place, fired this broadside: ''That
was the poorest refereeing performance I can ever remember, as a player
or a coach. Every time we went near the ball we appeared to be
penalised.''
Referee Henderson was not for apologising. Flanked by his two touch
judges, who backed him to the hilt, he told me: ''Academicals beat
themselves. They lost control at the end and either refused to retire 10
metres or deliberately killed the ball. Most of the offences were
blatant.''
The penalty count in the second half was 17-2 in Melrose's favour. So
whose side are we to take? To be perfectly honest, you simply cannot
referee a game from the grandstand. In the last five minutes it was so
murky I had great difficulty in seeing the ball at all.
Colin Henderson has had better games. The complaints were not all
one-sided; Melrose were sure Robbie Brown had got over for a try which
was disallowed. But certain Academicals do spend a lot of time on the
deck; they knew this referee would not wear it so it was not too clever
to persist with the same tactic.
I thought the Edinburgh side deserved the points because of their
heroic defending. The sight of Craig Chalmers being swept back on a
human tide of blue-and-white jerseys is a rare event.
The home side also scored the best try of the match, flanker Rob Hoole
finishing off a cracking move which was started by a Scott Murray
lineout take and carried on by a Mike Duncan break.
For Melrose, the pack churned back conveyor-belt ball which was not
always well used. Graham Shiel was the back most likely to penetrate but
he had to go off with a shoulder knock 15 minutes from time. He tells me
he will receive treatment this week but is confident of being fit for
the Western Samoan international.
Jeremy Richardson, another of the World Cup party, made his
reappearance for Academicals after a long spell on the sidelines. Sadly,
he did not last the pace, having to retire in the second half with a rib
injury.
It was a day as grey as an army blanket. Soon after kick-off, the rain
sleeted down and the pitch became a clinging mass of mud. There was no
way you were going to get vintage rugby in these conditions.
Brian Hay-Smith, who had a tidy afternoon, opened the scoring with a
penalty goal for the home side. Gary Parker replied in similar style for
Melrose but those who thought there would be a stream of Parker pens
were to be disappointed; he missed three chances before being replaced.
The first try was to Melrose. Isaac Fea'unati and Brown did the
spadework then Parker fed hooker Steve Brotherstone, who had popped up
on the left wing.
Three minutes from the break, the Academicals struck back. They opted
for a scrum instead of a penalty and promptly pushed the visitors over.
Martin Waite was credited with the try which Hay-Smith converted.
It was midway in the second half before Melrose regained the lead,
Chalmers kicking a penalty.
Hoole's try appeared to be decisive but, amid the encircling gloom,
Brian Redpath nipped over for Chalmers to convert. The home faithful
were furious.
On a calmer note, David Sole told me he is among the ranks of those
who wish to see a 10-team first division next season and the abolition
of the district championship. The support for this does seem to be
swelling.
The win keeps Melrose in the championship hunt. Coach Rob Moffat
quipped: ''There is no truth in the rumour that Ken McCartney (who
refereed their narrow win over Watsonians) and Colin Henderson are to be
the speakers at our dinner this year!''
Edinburgh Academicals -- S A D Burns; C R H Newton, C T Simmers, M
Duncan, K Bailie; B Hay-Smith, K Troup; J Fayers, K Day, B Stewart, J F
Richardson, S Murray, D J McIvor, M Waite, R Hoole. Replacement -- T

* ENGLAND's new stand-off Mike Catt had his first physical contact
work for three weeks yesterday and declared himself fully fit to play
for England against world champions South Africa next Saturday -- thanks
to the help of the Royal Navy.
Catt, who has not played since October 21, said yesterday: ''I was
sure that I would be fit, but my recovery had slowed and I was getting
concerned.
''I went down to Portsmouth naval base to have hyper-Baric treatment
on Friday and Saturday.
''It involved a total of three-and-a-half hours of sitting in a
'submarine' that simulates being 10 yards under water.
''It has worked for me at least psychologically, because I was fit
enough to take a full part in today's work-out.''
''I have three more days to rest and have treatment and hopefully I
will be fine.''
England were delighted that David Pears -- who injured a leg in a
collision with Catt last month -- came through Harlequins' match on
Saturday, although they took the precaution of calling up second
division Northampton's Paul Grayson.
England captain Will Carling ''did not over-extend himself'',
according to manager Jack Rowell, when the team trained at Twickenham
yesterday.

THE current edition of the Scottish Rugby Union house magazine, SRU
Voice, contains what we in the trade call an ''exclusive.''
My columnar colleague Johnnie Beattie is the only journo in captivity
who stills delights in calling those journalistic gems ''scoops.'' He
does so with the same relish that he brought to knocking over the likes
of Wade Dooley -- an unfortunate affair in the opening seconds of a
Calcutta Cup match which JB now puts down to a dreadful case of mistaken
identity, Maurice Colclough being the intended target. And rare is the
morning when John is not on one of his many phones asking: ''Any
scoops?''
But I digress. You are, by now, asking what is this SRU Voice
''scoop'' which the world and its auntie and John and his nationwide
network of informants -- they never sleep and their tentacles are
everywhere -- have overlooked?
We turn to page three of this SRU production, not in any expectation
that the eye will be greeted by what the coarser end of the trade refers
to, we believe, as Page Three Lovelies, but to discern what Telfer's
Topic is for the day.
For this is Jim Telfer, SRU director of rugby and national coaching
director. Personally, we call him ''Sir,'' which more than fits the
bill, but an East Coast newspaper has of late started calling him The
Supremo, which we must say is taking things altogether too far.
Telfer's Topic appears under the heading ''League Pressure Curbing
Free Flow.'' He says that he had been looking forward to the revamped
league season, but has been disappointed by the lack of consistent
quality displayed by the top sides. Competitive yes, quality no, is what
he is saying in essence. Well, he has said that before so, obviously,
that it not our ''scoop.''
Read on. ''Removing the spectre of league relegation may be a way
forward with no automatic drop. The system could work like this. Before
a team can be demoted to the division below it has to be defeated by the
top team of that division.
''This may encourage teams anchored at the bottom of the leagues to
play entertaining rugby, knowing that even if they remain at the foot,
they still have a chance of staying in the division after a play-off.''
This is, indeed, the SRU Voice ''scoop.''
''Murrayfield Supremo backs Sudden Death clashes'' might have been a
more appropriate headline in The Voice. And doesn't the concept have
merit. The prospect of the likes of Currie having to defeat the likes of
Gala before they could achieve promotion to Premiership One has all the
makings of a great day out for the rugby public.
The scenario has, of course, been tried and tested elsewhere, most
notably in New Zealand. The downside is that, without automatic
promotion and relegation, the divisions could become static. It may well
be that, however well they have played in the second division, Currie
would experience some trouble defeating division one strugglers Gala.
Nevertheless, I would be seriously tempted to chance the possibility
of the top clubs having life-time membership of the top division. The
play-offs would represent a series of cup finals with everything to play
for over 80 minutes. You win or you lose. You go up or you stay where
you are. As a marketing concept it is superb and one guaranteed to have
crowds flocking in.
Let's do it now. Whether the Premiership is to remain at eight teams
per division or be increased to 10. Or whether it is to be two for
relegation or one, play-offs should be the order of the day. You know it
makes sense.

THERE is a right royal battle raging between a west coast club and the
Scottish Rugby Union, and it all boils down to the honesty shown by the
club themselves, Irvine, and the punitive action taken by the SRU. It
highlights the problems faced when teams fail to fulfil league fixtures.
''I wonder if the SRU have members who are so far removed from the
playing of the game that they can't see things properly,'' says Irvine
senior vice president Dick McAllister. ''What really annoys us is the
complete injustice of it all.''
The story? On the Monday before the league Saturday of September 16,
Irvine had selected two front rows for their two fifteens and they only
had six front row players available. After training on the Thursday,
they found out that four of the players selected were unavailable due to
illness and injury.
The only other players they could have fielded would have been from
the under-18s, so after an emergency meeting of the board members of the
club present at 9.30 that night, it was decided to phone Madras and
Lenzie, their proposed opponents, and call off the fixtures instead of
risking the health of the youngsters. They told the SRU the following
day.
Quite reasonable? Yes, you would have thought so. The rules of the
competition say only that any postponed game must be played on the first
available Saturday. But Irvine received a letter from the SRU, written
on October 10, telling them that when they replayed the game they would
forfeit the points should they win.
Which sent the Irvine boys ballistic. They appealed. It went before
the main committee. The SRU's initial decision was upheld, however, and
so it appears that Irvine are to be penalised for preventing injury to
youngsters.
''It is a basic injustice when rules can just be made up like this,''
says McAllister. ''We believe that the front row is a special case. Any
referee we have spoken to agrees. We could have phoned up at two o'clock
in the afternoon on the day of the game and said that our bus had broken
down, but we were honest. We are going to speak to all the other clubs
in the league.''
What Irvine suggest, and I agree with them, is that this kind of
incident should be planned for and the rules should be written covering
the situation. And I agree that front row is a special case. There are
far too many tragic injuries to front row players and anything that can
prevent them is to be applauded. It's not as if Irvine are some
fly-by-night club either.
Andy Little, the championship convenor who is said to have been
sympathetic to the Irvine cause, says that the whole area of clubs
calling off is a minefield. ''Where do you draw the line? We have clubs
calling off games now and the system is being abused because they don't
have their strongest side available,'' says Little.
''It is a difficult area, it was taken through to the main committee
after our review, and their decision was the same one as the
championship committee.''
But that doesn't satisfy Irvine, who feel aggrieved that they now have
to send a team on to the pitch at some time in the future to trudge up
and down with no motivation. ''We are very unhappy with the SRU,'' says
McAllister. ''The rules have to more explicit.
It is simply not on for the SRU to be able to regulate like this.''
Rule 15 says ''. . . where a dispute or difficulty arises . . . it will
be referred to the Championship Committee whose decision shall be
binding . . .'' Loose or what?
I think that the SRU have it wrong in this case on two counts.
Firstly, you can't make up a punishment when there has been no
precedent. Irvine were told they should have tried to get replacement
props from neighbouring clubs, but to me these things have to be spelt
out. Secondly the rules have to be fully clarified.
The situation will only get worse as these ''smaller'' clubs get their
best players nicked by the bigger ones. The SRU should reconsider this
one and then write some decent rules for starters.

Wales 19, Fiji 15
WALES must run more and kick less if they are to re-emerge as a major
international force. That was the opinion of Fiji coach Brad Johnstone
after his side had been pipped 19-15 at Cardiff Arms Park on Saturday.
''I found Wales a bit predictable,'' said the former All Blacks prop.
''I believe they have got plenty of talent out in the backs which they
are not using. They are kicking the ball away and stifling their game.''
Wales took control from the kick-off and went 5-0 ahead in the eighth
minute with a try by Andy Moore, Jenkins making it 10-0 eight minutes
later.
But Fiji hit back on the half-hour with a superb try from Manasa Bari.
Jonetani Waga converted to reduce the deficit to 10-7 and then levelled
the match at the interval with a penalty.
Jenkins, strangely off form with his goalkicking, finally found his
range in the forty-fifth minute to put Wales back in front with a
penalty, before Fiji took the lead for the only time in the match with a
try three minutes later by Filipe Rayasi.
But it was short-lived. Jenkins regained the advantage for Wales with
a fifty-second-minute penalty and then landed another penalty from 30
yards 13 minutes later to clinch victory.

France 22, New Zealand 15
FRANCE laid aside their problems with their federation to score a
shock win over the All Blacks in the first Test at Toulouse on Saturday.
The French, who were faster to the ball, led 17-3 at the interval
thanks to tries from full back Jean-Luc Sadourny and centre Richard
Dourthe.
But New Zealand, with a powerful following wind in the second period,
rallied strongly to cut the gap to 17-15 with 18 minutes left thanks to
five penalties from fly-half Simon Culhane.
A determined French side managed to hold on and broke away to score a
third try 10 minutes from the end when captain Philippe Saint-Andre went
over by the right-corner flag.
Despite fears that Thursday's players' revolt against their federation
could harm team spirit, the French showed great commitment and deserved
their victory.
''This was a historic win for us,'' said Saint-Andre. ''''Despite the
problems we had this week, we showed great fighting spirit. I'm proud to
be captain of this team.''
All Blacks' captain Sean Fitzpatrick said: ''They had more commitment
in the first half and they used the wind better than we did.
''The French played with a lot of spirit and heart. We'll have to go
back to the drawing board now and see what went wrong.''

Selkirk 9, Currie 12
THERE were just three minutes left on the clock when Dean Sheppard
called for the ball, took a quick look at the post through the gathering
gloom, and speared home the 40-metre winning drop goal.
For Currie, it was the kick that could have made them Division II
champions, but for Selkirk, Sheppard's bright spark of intuitive flair
amid an afternoon of gloom and glaur meant that relegation was staring
them squarely in the face.
As it turned out, with Jed-Forest winning at Dundee, Currie must wait
at least another week for championship glory and Selkirk will not know
their destiny until their remaining Premiership games against Jed and
GHK have been played out. This cut-throat second division is certainly
not for the faint-hearted.
Sheppard, a 25-year-old Kiwi who plays for the Counties provincial
side in New Zealand, said later that the drop-goal effort had not been
an impromptu affair.
''I knew that time was running out and I had been thinking that if the
opportunity came, then I would give it a shot.''
Opportunity knocked with a miscued Selkirk clearance which was fielded
by Currie winger Scott Ferguson and fed to the Kiwi full back.
''I wasn't sure whether it was on target or not. I was as worried as
everyone else. Then I looked up and it was between the posts,'' he said.
For just a little over 10 minutes, the two sides had been locked on
nine points apiece, Rodney Pow's three penalty goals being matched by
two penalties and a drop-goal by Ally Donaldson.
A draw would have been a fair result for two sides who had flogged
themselves to a drookit stalemate amid the most atrocious conditions.
But fortune favours the brave and Sheppard's match-winner was, if not
particularly brave, then certainly bold, and perfectly executed at that.
Selkirk coach John Rutherford said later that he was devastated. The
former Scotland fly-half has experienced most of the conflicting
emotions that rugby can inflict but he was really suffering at no-side
on Saturday.
''That was harsh. It was a terrific drop-goal, there's no mistake
about that. But that was harsh.
''The boys had worked so hard and they have nothing to show for it.
''That game today showed that there is absolutely nothing between the
top and the bottom in this division and yet two sides are going to be
relegated. That can't be right,'' he said.
Rutherford also questioned the prudence of playing the Scotland A game
against the Samoans on a Sunday.
''That could have been played under lights on Friday and it would have
meant that we wouldn't have been without our best player, Scott
Nichol,'' he said.
Rutherford's analysis did not take into account the fact that Currie
hooker Graham Ellis was also posted missing due to A team duties but one
had to sympathise, none the less. When clubs are involved in such
desperate premiership business, they are to be forgiven for thinking
that representative duties should not intervene.
Currie coach Bruce Macnaughton made much the same kind of point when
he bemoaned the absence of Ellis for his throwing in at the lineout, if
nothing else.
Macnaughton was also mighty glad that his ambitious side had come good
at at the end of the day.
''They're tough to beat down here. We expected a hard, hard fight and
we got it.
''Ally Donaldson was the key for us today. He controlled the game and
when he does that, it makes a big difference to the entire team,'' he
said.
Selkirk had by far the better of the early exchanges, the diminutive
Andy Lindores proving that a big heart does not have to be encased in a
giant body.
They took the lead after 14 minutes with a Pow penalty goal. The
Selkirk stand-off, largely, played well but, as Rutherford observed
later, he did not have the power of punt to play the big touchline game
required against the elements in the second period.
Donaldson equalised after 18 minutes and Selkirk went back ahead with
Pow's second penalty goal after half-an-hour, and it was his third
successful shot at goal that handed Selkirk a 9-3 lead at the interval.
In the second period Currie began clawing back into contention. The
experienced Donaldson kicked the champions-elect into potentially
profitable situations but sound Selkirk defence and errors induced
largely by the elements maintained the stalemate until Donaldson's
fifty-first-minute drop-goal set the scoreboard ticking over.
After 66 minutes Donaldson equalised with a penalty goal and 11
minutes later Sheppard's majestic, if soggy, drop-goal clinched it for
the city side.

MORE than 35 knots of easterly wind added spice to the second race of
the Scottish Islands Liqueur Frostbite series off Kip Marina yesterday,
escalating minor problems into major incidents.
A pre-start collision between John Kelly's Niad III, a Contessa 33
which awaited the Class 2 start, and the starting Class 1 boat Mr Vain,
a First Class Europe owned by Frank Lee, resulted in both losing their
masts when they became spectacularly entwined.
With no waves to speak of thanks to the offshore wind direction, there
was plenty of scope to keep the boat speed up maximising sail power.
Three boats are still unbeaten. John Corson's J35 Salamander XII,
which won the preceding autumn series overall, continued at a brisk
pace, winning Class 1 by a comprehensive 10 minutes. Martin Maiden's
Scampi Itch in Class 3 won by one-and-a-half minutes on corrected time,
a margin also enjoyed by Class 4's double winner Screwball, a modified
Intro sailed by Ian Rice. Results:
Scottish Islands Liqueur Frostbite series, Race 2: Class 1 -- 1,

0-0 with Sampdoria in a match marking the opening of the the English
club's new #16m Riverside Stadium.
The Brazilian delighted the 9972 crowd with some neat touches but
could not inspire the goal that would have broken the deadlock.
Player-manager Bryan Robson -- who had a goal disallowed five minutes
from time -- squanderd the best chance of the game after 19 minutes.

GRAEME Smith smashed the longest-standing Scottish short-course record
at the final session of the Speedo British Grand Prix Meet at
Cumbernauld yesterday.
While world No.1 Sandra Volker failed in her world-record attempt in
the 50m back-stroke -- a car was the lure -- Smith overpowered the
opposition to set a new mark of 3-50.65 in the 400m free-style.
European championship silver medallist in the 1500m free-style, the
19-year-old was just under a second inside the mark set by Paul Easter
in 1983.
''I wanted to go under 3-55, but I never expected to anything like
this,'' said Smith. ''But I could see everyone waving me on down the
final length, so I knew I must be close.''
Fraser Walker's hopes of a medley double were thwarted by the man who
kept him out of the British team spot at the European championships,
James Hickman.
He came within fractions of the English record to take gold in a meet
record of 2-01.71, with the Scot taking second place a second adrift.
On Saturday Beverly Robertson won the 100m breast-stroke, smashing her
personal best to win in 1-14.50. Results:
Men. 400m free-style -- 1, G Smith (Stockport Metro) 3min 50.65sec; 2,
I Wilson (City of Leeds) 3-57.12; 3, M Hickey (Warrington) 4-09.39.

PAUL McPhillips hopes to enjoy a good night's sleep in readiness for
this evening's best-of-11 frames semi-final against Enghlishman Robert
Milkins in the Benson &amp; Hedges championship.
However, faced by the ''biggest match of my career'' it's unlikely the
world No.64 from Thornliebank will have had much shut-eye. ''I beat
Ronnie O'Sullivan a few years ago, but this has to be the most important
game I've played in. There's so much at stake,'' added McPhillips after
a nerve-jangling 5-4 success over Matt Wilson in the quarter-finals at
Edinburgh.
McPhillips recovered from 3-0 down to defeat Nick Walker of Chester
5-3 in the last 16 and then came back from a 37-point deficit in the
decider to squeeze past Wilson.
''I feared the worst,'' said McPhillips, who is hoping to follow in
the footsteps of Alan McManus and Chris Small as former winners.
Tomorrow night's champion picks a #5000 first prize plus a wild card
invitation to the B &amp; H Masters at Wembley next February.
Larkhall's Graeme Dott won't be joining him in the last four after
losing 5-2 in the last eight to Scunthorpe's Matthew Couch. The
Englishman takes on Welsh teenager Matthew Stevens, a 5-4 winner over
1994 runner-up Rod Lawler.
Earlier, first-year professional Milkins knocked out India's Amrik
Cheema 5-2 to continue his remarkable run.

Airdrie 2, Dumbarton 1
PLENTY of fuss about very little. There we were sitting at Broadwood,
the boredom almost numbing -- nothing new there -- as the teams battered
the ball up and down the sodden field.
Then, with some of us checking watches to ascertain how much more we
had to suffer, something actually happened. Not a lot, but enough for
referee George Clyde to become very excited and actually send a player
indoors.
A savage kick causing great injury? No. A right hook sending an
opponent crashing to the grass? No. An elbow in the face? No again.
What happened was that two players stared at each other from close
quarters for a few seconds after a challenge, and referee Clyde reacted.
A linesman was chatted with before Dumbarton keeper Ian MacFarlane was
asked to remove himself from the field, while the other ''sinner,'' Jim
McIntyre, was admonished.
It is little wonder that the Airdrie player looked a little shocked as
he chatted about the incident later. ''Handbags at 10 paces,'' was his
initial thought. ''He didn't do anything and neither did I,'' said the
player. ''We squared up to each other, end of story. The referee was a
bit harsh in sending him off.''
Of course, none of this would probably have mattered too much if we
were being entertained, but Airdrie were having another off day, while
Dumbarton appeared totally clueless.
Their manager, Jim Fallon, is short of hair but his dome will resemble
a billiard ball by May as a result of frustration if his men do not pull
themselves together.
He spoke of a lack of belief which is coursing through his men, and
certainly the sight of Chic Charnley, he of the educated left foot,
continually passing the ball to an opponent and giving up when
possession was lost by Dumbarton was a sad sight.
Three Airdrie players scored the goals on Saturday, with John Davies
and Kenny Black on target for their side, and Jimmy Boyle putting
through his own goal near the end.

Clydebank 0, Dunfermline 4
IN A perfect world, the substitution would be hailed as a stroke of
genius. After just four minutes, manager Bert Paton replaced Brian Rice
with David Bingham, who scored twice in the trouncing that consolidated
Dunfermline's leader's spot.
But Paton admitted later that Bingham's early appearance was enforced
with Rice pulling a muscle within 30 seconds of kick-off at Kilbowie.
Bingham hit 22 goals with Forfar last season, but until Saturday, he
was still looking for his first goal for Dunfermline.
Skipper Norrie McCathie set up this rout with the opening goal in 42
minutes. However, it was the only moment of magic in a first half which
summed up Scottish football on a wet, windswept winter's day.
But the second goal, albeit from farcical circumstances, was awesome.
Garry Matthews, inexplicably, chose to clear with a short throw to Tom
Currie, already under pressure. He slipped, was robbed, and Fleming's
25-yard curling shot hit the underside of the bar before going in.
Clydebank immediately replaced out-of-sorts Ken Eadie and Scott
Murdoch. It made no difference, except to underline how small the
frontline was in comparison with Dunfermline's back four, whose giants
included Finnish internationalist Kari Rissannen, over here on trial and
making his debut.
Paton wants him to stay: ''He thought the game was much faster than at
home, but he did well. I would hope to sign him.''
Bingham's goals came in the last five minutes -- carbon copies,
netting unchallenged from Stewart Petrie crosses. After only five starts
this season, Bingham confessed his confidence was low until Saturday:
''I hope more goals will follow, but I am not setting targets.''
Bankies' coach Brian Wright waited 45 minutes before leaving the
dressing room to comment. ''The goals were embarrassing. No team will
ever come here and get four easier. The first two were comic cuts, the
others just as shocking.''

St Johnstone 2,
Hamilton Accies 0
IAIN Munro has had a long and sometimes distinguished career in
football. But even he was forced to look heaven-wards at the end of 90
minutes at McDiarmid Park.
He said: ''I can't fault my players for lack of commitment or effort,
but when you are at the bottom trying to get away, you just don't seem
to get any breaks.''
He certainly had a point when St Johnstone scored their second goal.
Allan Preston intercepted the ball on the halfway line, left a number of
defenders trailing in his wake before rounding the keeper and slotting
home at an angle from 16 yards.
A goal fit to win any game, but as Munro pointed out, defender Chris
Hillcoat had gone off the pitch to have his studs adjusted and was then
refused leave to rejoin the fray just as Preston crowned his solo
effort. Hillcoat was also booked for overstating his objections.
However, Hamilton's dismal record -- 13 games without a win -- belies
a spirit in the ranks. ''That has to count for something,'' said the
manager.
Naturally, the home manager was the happier man. Particularly pleasing
for Paul Sturrock is that his youth policy is already paying dividends.
With full back John McQuillan's knee injury proving troublesome,
youngster Andy Whiteford was drafted in and made an impressive debut.
''I was very pleased with his performance,'' said the manager. ''Three
of our youth squad are now featuring in the first-team pool.''
On the game itself, Sturrock felt it was a disjointed display and the
number of missed chances is a constant problem. Indeed, Saints should
have been well ahead before they eventually broke the deadlock in 38
minutes.
O'Boyle sent Twaddle through the middle and he drew the keeper before
squaring for John O'Neill.
Preston's solo effort came in 66 minutes and puts Saints two-thirds of
the way to the manager's immediate goal of three successive victories.
However, lowly Hamilton are one thing -- it's leaders Dunfermline this
Saturday.

St Mirren 1, Dundee Utd 1
ALL drawn games count equally, but this one was more equal than most.
Really, the weather won. Otherwise, some other sort of natural law
seemed to decide the verdict.
All present were so wet and wind-blown, it would have been too much to
send them home with nothing to show for their good attendance.
As with other laws, however, how the score was settled was strange.
Both teams went about their work in an odd way in order to end even.
At the conclusion they looked like different sides from the two that
started. It was a kind of rain dance of a game. Dundee United retired,
while St Mirren advanced, and so they finished together.
United opened mightily. They were very much on their high horse --
haughty and totally in charge. They commanded the field. It was their
ball.
St Mirren had hardly a sniff of it. Even the small possession they did
have seemed to embarrass them.
When United's goal came about the middle of the first half, it looked
as if St Mirren were going to be swept aside by more than the rain.
A leisurely cross by Maurice Malpas was neatly headed in by Robbie
Winters. It was a goal that appeared pre-ordained and a preliminary to
several more of the same.
An item of stray information in the encyclopaedic match programme
divulged that according to the Times of Malta (yes!) newspaper, another
nickname in the Mediterranean for the Saints is the Zebras.
Whether or not the players had digested this morsel of information, it
did look as if all St Mirren's traffic had stopped and they were going
to be walked all over, just like a street crossing.
How a green light showed for them was at first dimly. The first blink
of a change came when an aimless free kick by Bobby Law caused
unaccountable congestion around United's goal.
Steven Pressley felt forced into a contorted header that flew narrowly
past his own goal. Then in the confusion which followed an overhead kick
by Barry Lavety that was cleared off the line, an unnerved Pressley
toppled Mark Yardley in the box.
Ricky Gillies, who often was a useful third man to the promising
pairing of Yardley and Lavety, scored with the penalty.
St Mirren's confidence, much of it resting on their growing faith in
the goalkeeping of Alan Combe, was much improved by their goal. A
makeshift looking defence owed a lot to the phlegmatic coolness of Paul
Fenwick.
Apart from Winters, United showed little invention. Even Andy McLaren,
like everybody else, was content to play long, high balls in the hope
they would catch on the wind.
Mechanical became the word for his team-mates. They began to look as
if they could be wound up only by having a key turned in a hole in their
back, except they had lost the key.
United are finding it hard to perform under the belief that failure to
win promotion will be the end of the world.

Dundee 0, Morton 0
DEREK McInnes will stride into the marble hall of Ibrox today, and
nothing short of a major disaster will see him leaving the hallowed
premises still captain of Greenock Morton.
After having played his heart out as usual on Saturday in the
first-division clash at Dens Park, McInnes was as positive as his
on-field display. ''The speculation is over. The clubs have agreed, and
although I am not pre-empting anything, only myself or Rangers can hold
it up now. I only have personal terms to negotiate, and I don't see any
problems there.''
There was a distinct note of relief when he said: ''I really felt that
today was my last game for Morton. I have always been able to handle
speculation before, but when you are so close to realising an ambition,
it is very difficult.
''However, as I was captain of the club, I had a certain
responsibility. The players also helped. The dressing-room banter was
great.''
Now that the hard part is almost over after the clubs agreed on a deal
thought to be in the region of #450,000, some may be tempted to say to
the 24-year-old: ''You ain't seen nothing yet, son.''
But the lad who walked into Cappielow eight seasons ago, and virtually
has played first-team football since then, has learned his trade well
under manager Allan McGraw.
He said: ''I know there will be competition for places at Ibrox, and
that it will be difficult to establish myself. My head has been full of
contracts and speculation. All I want to do now is get on with it, and
work hard.
''I will not be overawed going into the dressing room, even though
it's full of international players. I must take up the challenge, and
being around people like that can only help to make me a better player.
If I don't, then it will be down to myself.''
One slight blemish on Saturday could prove to be costly. McInnes was
booked after only three minutes for handball in the middle of the park.
''A rush of blood to the head,'' was how he described it. Now he has to
wait to see how many points the referee adds, but the player thinks he
already is dangerously close to the 16-point mark after five previous
bookings.
Manager Allan McGraw not only praised McInnes for his positive
attitude under the circumstances, but the remainder of his team, who
gave as good as they got in a match spoiled by a bitter easterly wind
and driving rain.
And although outnumbered, a good contingent of Greenock fans not only
made the long journey, but made sure their voices were well heard --
particularly as far as McInnes was concerned. ''Year in, year out, they
see players leaving the club, yet their reaction to me has been
tremendous, and I must thank them for that,'' he said.
Credit to both sides for trying to continue to play football, and both
keepers were forced into excellent saves to keep the scoresheet blank --
Morton's David Wylie made a couple of blinders in the first half to deny
Neil Duffy and Paul Tosh, and a post denied a fierce shot from Dusan
Vrto. Dundee's Michel Pageaud palmed a Derek Lilley header for a corner
in 77 minutes, and a minute later, he just got his fingertips to an Alan
Mahood shot as Morton took command for a while after the interval.
Of the chances created, particularly in that first half, Dundee were
the more disappointed at not having hit the net. Player-manager Jim
Duffy, voted man-of-the-match, said afterwards: ''We should have taken a
couple of them, and on top of that, their keeper made good saves.''
The Dens side also are disappointed with their home league form --
they have won only one match in the six played, with four of them draws.
However, their unbeaten away form bodes well for next week's Tannadice
derby against Dundee United, and the Coca-Cola Cup final against
Aberdeen at Hampden the following Sunday.
McGraw admitted afterwards that he was reasonably satisfied with the
point at Dens, but it was left to McInnes to have the last few words. He
said: ''Everyone talks about Morton's midfield and forwards, and the
fact that we are an attacking side.
''But it's time that the back four were given some praise. They were
criticised at the start of the season, but that's five games now with
only one goal lost -- and that was a penalty.''
The fact that Dundee have scored in every one of their previous 19
games in all competitions is further testimony.

LINLITHGOW Rose's unbeaten 16-game run came to an abrupt halt on
Saturday when they travelled to meet Arthurlie in the second round of
the OVD Cup.
Arthurlie, with the wind behind them, pressured Rose from the start
and went ahead in 25 minutes when Rose's veteran central defender Walter
Boyd knocked the ball back beyond his keeper to allow Stevie Convery the
simple task of scoring in an empty net.
At the start of the second half Arthurlie weathered the early storm
with Rose's Muir and McConville coming close. In 59 minutes, striker
Convery broke clear and cut in to send a right-foot shot past keeper
McPherson to make it 2-0 and put the tie beyond Linlithgow's reach.
A John Randells double wasn't enough to continue Bonnyrigg Rose's
interest in the competition. They went down to goals by Kilwinning's
Dickson, Pirrie, and Peline.
In the all-Ayrshire tie, Auchinleck struggled against a stuffy Ardeer
Thistle team, but a solo effort from Chris Ellis and a Tom McDonald
header took Talbot into the third round.
Much fancied Armadale trailed Beith 1-0 after Steven Quigg netted from
a Derek Love cross early in the game. Armadale put Beith under constant
pressure throughout the second half in search of the equaliser. However,
with two minutes to go, Quigg scored a second and within a minute he
completed his hat trick.
An inspired substitution by Carluke manager Stuart Millar took his
side through against Crombie Sports. Behind 2-1, a double by substitute
Alan Burnside in the last 12 minutes took Carluke through by 4-2.
Two goals each by Milne and Millar in the last 15 minutes gave
Glenafton a resounding 5-1 victory over Benburb, scorers of 16 goals in
the last round.
A second-half hat trick by Tom Woods gave Baillieston a fine victory
over Stonehouse. In the other all-Central ties, Shettleston and Dunipace
drew, Kirkintilloch Rob Roy continued their good run with a 4-1 away win
over Thorniewood, and Cumbernauld won by the odd goal in five against
Cambuslang Rangers.
Camelon were the highest scorers of the round with their 10-0 victory
over Luncarty. Cumnock and Stonehaven had 9-0 wins over Bankfoot and
Blairgowrie respectively.
The St Anthony's v Forres game was abandoned following a third-minute
double leg break to the North team's striker, Ian McLeod. The Junior
Association have decided that St Anthony's will go forward to the
third-round draw, which will be made in the Camelon Juniors' social club

Rangers 1, Aberdeen 1
SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown has told Eoin Jess his chances of playing
in Scotland's midfield are not good. The Aberdeen player has been left
in no doubt that if he wishes to collect more international caps, then
he should be willing to put himself up for selection as a striker.
Against Rangers on Saturday, with the Scotland manager watching from
the Ibrox stand, the 24-year-old decided to make a play for both
positions. Jess was outstanding in Aberdeen's midfield, and also scored
their goal, which was a thing of stunning beauty.
He was the dominant player in the middle of the pitch, a violent
domain at times, and much of the good things Aberdeen did flowed from
him. He received the ball, ran with it, and played it off to others. He
had such a big afternoon for a player so slight of build, although he is
not exactly a weakling.
In fact, Rangers' Stuart McCall believes Jess's upper body has become
more powerful, but stressed that the most noticeable difference in the
younger man is the level of his confidence. ''Much of our game is about
that,'' McCall said. ''Confidence is important to any player and you can
see Eoin is thriving right now, which must be good for Scotland.
''Going forward he is very good to watch and you'd expect him to do
San Marino a bit of damage.''
There is little doubt Jess will start in Scotland's final European
Championship qualifying match at Hampden on Wednesday night, but Brown
is likely to deploy him in a striking role even though he was impressed
with his midfield performance. Indeed, if Jess were to insist he wanted
only to be considered as a midfield player he would have a strong case
for inclusion in Brown's team in any case.
The manner in which he scored his goal in 27 minutes suggested he has
found his true position, because as soon as Alan McLaren hit a high
clearance Jess was moving in behind Ian Ferguson, which seemed strange
at the time, but which proved to be the right choice. Ferguson had
misjudged the ball's flight and with a precise first touch Jess
controlled the ball as it dropped and then surged forward.
He had acres of space to romp through, and from approximately 25
yards, he smacked the ball into the top right-hand corner of Billy
Thomson's net.
The goal will be remembered by those who witnessed it, but Jess's
overall contribution also was immense, and if he continues to revel in
his new role, then Scotland's other midfield players will have to
maintain, and perhaps even improve their own standards. Jess finally
looks as though he is ready to become the footballer most of us thought
he could be.
''I said three years ago that I thought Eoin Jess would be a player,''
said McCall, who also is in the Scottish squad and who was the player
most responsible for dragging Rangers back into the match against
Aberdeen. His determination and running power helped to subdue
Aberdeen's midfield, which had taken control after a busy start by
Rangers.
However, as the Ibrox side's assistant manager Archie Knox said, the
game was a smaller reflection of Rangers' season so far. ''Started well,
fell away, lost a goal, and battled back,'' he said.
''We had good spells and spells when we were not so good, but I
suppose when you are fiddling with the team the way we are, then it is
difficult to get the best out of the players.''
Again too many of Rangers' players gave too little, and again Paul
Gascoigne looked out of sorts. He spent much of his time, until he was
taken off just after an hour of play, snarling at the referee, John
Rowbotham, and those around him, but he was fortunate he left the pitch
by his management's choice and not through dismissal.
Aberdeen's manager Roy Aitken was happy to talk about the manner in
which his team had performed at Ibrox pointing out: ''All the players
stood up to be counted and I thought we were the better side. I take a
lot of satisfaction from the way we played here.''
Apart from Jess, others worthy of special mention were Gary Smith and
Stephen Glass, who continues to develop into a fine player.
Oleg Salenko scored Rangers equaliser five minutes from half-time and
his goal also was attractive. Alexei Mikhailichenko, who deposed Ally
McCoist, sent a good ball from the left to McCall beyond the far post
and when he knocked the ball back across the face of goal, Salenko was
waiting to score.
Rangers were fortunate to go indoors level because Scott Booth should
have scored in 45 minutes and Thomson was the busier of the two keepers
in the second half.
The Ibrox side attempted to redress the balance by taking off
Mikhailichenko and Gascoigne, and allowing McCoist and Ian Durrant to
take over, but little changed and John Brown, who went on for Gary
Bollan in 78 minutes, couldn't bring his renowned determination to bear.
In fact, Brown was fortunate to escape punishment four minutes from
time when Billy Dodds and Alan McLaren tussled. Brown became involved
and appeared to lift his hands to the Aberdeen striker.
However, the referee took no action, much to the annoyance of Aitken
who stood seething at the side of the pitch.
Four players, Alex Cleland and Ferguson, of Rangers, and Aberdeen's
Stewart McKimmie and Glass, were booked in a match which was littered
with nasty little tackles. Still, it was an entertaining enough
spectacle.

THE highly successful English manager leading his team out at Wembley
on Wednesday night is now respected all over the world and ready for the
challenge of next summer's European Championships. Unfortunately, his
name is not Terry Venables, but Roy Hodgson, coach to both Switzerland
and Inter Milan.
It will be difficult to avoid comparisons between the two Londoners
and the progress they have made with their respective teams as the Swiss
provide the latest test for England.
These days, Hodgson is not quite so much a prophet without honour in
his own land. Even supporters of Bristol City, where he was briefly
manager at a difficult time for the club in 1982, acknowledge that he
must have something about him to have transformed the prospects of a
traditionally modest football country and subsequently to have been
installed as coach to one of the most famous clubs in the world.
Not surprisingly, he was being spoken of, before joining Inter, as a
possible candidate to become the Football Association's technical
director, reflecting the sudden, belated desire in English football for
a more cosmopolitan outlook. His name will figure, too, in any
discussions about possible successors to Venables should things go wrong
next June.
At present, they could be considerably better. Venables' reign has
progressed through the familiar pattern of popular and media support
into its first trough, and become stuck there.
England have won only one game in a year, which was by means of a
last-minute penalty against Japan; Alan Shearer, widely considered to be
their one player close to world class, has not scored a goal in seven
internationals, yet the manager refuses to bring in any of the
alternative strikers available, either as replacements or in support.
The most recent game, a goalless draw in Norway, brought widespread
condemnation from the public and much (admittedly exaggerated) press
abuse.
A further complication is Venables' off-field problems, which have
seen him involved in almost as many court cases as international
fixtures. Some have arisen from a perfectly legitimate desire to right
wrongs that he believes have been done to him. Others, brought against
him in connection with his complex financial dealings, have led to
accusations and insinuations that the public is not used to hearing
about national sporting leaders.
Sir Alf Ramsey, Don Revie, Ron Greenwood, Bobby Robson, and Graham
Taylor all felt at times that they were being persecuted, but none ever
called in the police to investigate allegations of a criminal conspiracy
against them.
Roy Hodgson is learning about the heat of the kitchen in Milan. Terry
Venables badly needs the right result against him this week.

AN SFA probe is likely after ugly crowd scenes marred the first half
of Saturday's Qualifying Cup final at Huntly's Christie Park when
Fraserburgh ended a 38-year famine in the competition, clinching a
dramatic 4-3 win over Keith with a strike from substitute John Geddes
after 119 minutes.
The inquiry seems inevitable after fighting broke out in full view of
guest of honour, SFA secretary Jim Farry.
From about the tenth minute, police struggled to restore order among a
section of the 1200-plus crowd. Violence began in the Keith section of
the packed enclosure, where a few feet of scaffolding was segregating
rival supporters.
Play was halted for several minutes as fans spilled on to the park and
police reinforcements were called in.
There were between 15 and 20 arrests, and a Grampian police spokesman
revealed yesterday that two were still in custody, and an undisclosed
number had been released after having been charged.
As for the match itself, Paul Keith, John Thomson, Mike McCafferty,
and of course, Geddes scored for Fraserburgh, while Keith's goals came
from Scott Taylor, John Wilson, and John Thomson.

THE Italian FA has come in for widespread criticism for deliberately
imposing a period of suspension on a dead player.
Luigi Coluccio, ordered off in an amateur game playing for Gioiosa
Jonica against Bocale, was later shot outside a pub in what is believed
was a Mafia execution.
Several days later his family protested about the insensitivity when a
letter was received saying that Coluccio had been suspended.
But Nino Cosentino, chairman of the disciplinary commission, replied:
''We had to suspend him even though he was dead. We regret it, but this
is how our system operates. Promotion and relegation can be decided on
discipline.''
* THERE is an unseasonal message for managers in a survey carried out
over the past three seasons.
This covered those dismissed in the premier leagues of Italy, Holland,
Belgium, Spain, Germany, England, and France. It concluded that, unless
they were sacked by Christmas, it was too late to help improve their
clubs.
A total of 137 managers were fired in this period. When they were
shown the door after Christmas, it has been shown that almost all their
successors were unable to improve the clubs. But if they were dismissed
earlier in the season, there was a marked difference. Only seven clubs
out of the 47 who acted sooner rather than later failed to benefit.
Former French international Alain Giresse, who has replaced Roland
Courbis at Toulouse, will be hoping he is one of the exceptions.
* UEFA have underlined their determination to stamp out racism by
notifying each association of their responsibilities.
Secretary General Gerhard Aigner, stating that racism was an
unacceptable attack on the sport, said: ''There is a dangerous trend
towards an increasing abuse of football matches as stages for the
popularisation of opinions and beliefs which have nothing to do with the
game.
''Those responsible for our game must make it absolutely clear they
are determined to stand up to such developments and keep football and
its environment free from such abuse.''
* HOLLAND have put each of their players on an extra #40,000 bonus to
beat Norway in Rotterdam on Wednesday and qualify for the finals of the
European Championships.
The Dutch must win and coach Guus Hiddink is certain the massive cash
incentive will maintain his country's place among Europe's elite.
* CONTROVERSIAL Bernd Schuster has parted acrimoniously from Bayer
Leverkusen, with general manager Rainer Calmund ridiculing his fading
talent. ''Offensively he is still world class,'' said Calmund of his
midfielder, who earned #500,000 annually. ''But defensively, he could
not survive in a pub team.''
Schuster, whose career has been plagued with disputes with his various
employers, is now suing the club. But he already has an estimated
fortune of #9m.
* KAISERSLAUTERN are the first German club to market condoms in their
club colours.

FOOTBALL ROUND-UP
JUVENTUS striker Fabrizio Ravanelli helped Italy further towards the
European Championship finals with two goals in a 3-1 defeat of Ukraine
on Saturday.
The silver-haired forward twice provided the finishing touches to send
Italy into the lead after outsiders Ukraine had grabbed an early goal.
Ravanelli's goals after 21 and 48 minutes, shepherded across the line
after others had done the hard work, brought his tally to an impressive
four in five matches, vindicating Sacchi's decision to prefer him to
Lazio's Pier Luigi Casiraghi. Milan's Paolo Maldini scored Italy's third
with a volley after 54 minutes.
Andry Polunin was credited with Ukraine's goal in 19 minutes, latching
on to a cross from busy winger Gennady Orbu to beat diving keeper Angelo
Peruzzi.
* AN ACROBATIC display by keeper Wilfred Agbonavbare enabled
bottom-placed Rayo Vallecano to hold Spanish league leaders Atletico
Madrid to a goalless draw yesterday.
The Nigerian internationalist saved on several occasions from
Bulgarian Luboslav Penev, who also missed a first-half penalty. Penev, a
summer signing from Valencia, has been one of the key figures in
Atletico's revival after the side narrowly avoided relegation last
season.

Hearts 2, Kilmarnock 1
FORMER Hearts chairman Wallace Mercer is back in Edinburgh just in
time for what promises to be a stormy annual meeting of the club he sold
last season.
The Hearts shareholders will meet at Ingliston on Thursday, when the
joint-owners, chairman Chris Robinson and his right-hand man Leslie
Deans, will be under fire because of the club's perilous financial
situation.
One group of shareholders claim the debt is close to #6m, though
Robinson recently told me that the current regime had plans to
restructure the club's debt and thus stave off any immediate threat to
the club's future.
One group of dissidents, led by Edinburgh doctor Gavin Kennedy, wants
to know what provisions the directors have made to cover compensation
claims against them from ex-manager Tommy McLean, sacked in the summer,
and from Falkirk over the poaching of manager Jim Jefferies.
But while the dissidents may make a lot of noise there seems no-one
out there with the money to buy out the current owners and then bail out
the club.
As one shareholder said to me at the weekend: ''The one thing we all
know about Chris Robinson is that he inherited a great deal of the debt,
and that could not disappear overnight.
''But he is a Hearts' man and that will count for a great deal at the
annual meeting.''
At Tynecastle on Saturday, Hearts proved that a week is a long time in
football, never mind politics.
After having brought in French keeper Gilles Rousset, Italian defender
Pasquale Bruno, and Swedish front man Hans Eskilsson, manager Jim
Jefferies has guided his team from bottom place to fifth in the space of
seven days.
But while the spotlight remained on the imports, it took veteran
striker John Robertson to shift the emphasis towards 20-year-old
defender Gary Locke, who was named captain at the start of the
three-game run which has transformed the side's premier-division
position.
Robertson, who had an assist in Locke's important opening goal, and
then helped himself to the second towards the end, admitted there had
been a few gasps of disbelief in the dressing room when the manager made
his decision public.
But the striker added: ''It has been one of the manager's master
strokes. Gary has the respect of all the senior professionals at the
club because of his ability and the way he feels for Hearts. Honestly,
that boy bleeds maroon, he really does.
''He reminds me of Alan McLaren, and he captained the team when he was
still in his teens. He has the same kind of mean determination to
succeed that Alan always showed. We were all surprised during the week
when he was not named in the Scotland Under-21 side.''
Locke believes, of course, that he will simply step back into the
shadows once Dave McPherson returns from injury. He is probably right,
but his contribution has ensured a future in the first team which had
seemed out of his reach last season, when he spent long spells out of
the side.
He said: ''It was marvellous to get the goal. At half-time, John
Robertson had spoken to me about how I was getting forward. In the first
half, I had been breaking down the wing and John suggested that I should
try to come inside a little more.
''When I did that, he was there and I played a one-two with him and
was able to force the ball over the line. It was down to Robbo as much
as me.''
The goal was the important breakthrough for Hearts. Both Jefferies and
Kilmarnock manager Alex Totten agreed later that the first goal was
always going to be vital. Unfortunately, Killie's strike did not come
until five minutes from time, when Colin McKee scored.
Totten commented, a mite bitterly: ''We played as well as Hearts did
today and it was the same during the week against Rangers, and yet we
don't have a single point from these two games. It is hard to take.
''We are not taking chances the way other teams are taking them
against us. That is why we have dropped back into the danger zone.
''Hearts have been able to wheel and deal in bringing in these new
players, and they have helped them turn the corner. That is what we need
right now, but I cannot even go out and sign a free-transfer man.
''There are times in every season when you have a need to bring in
fresh players -- not necessarily big-money signings. I have not spent a
single penny since last season and I won't be spending anything in the
foreseeable future. I just can't do it.''
Jefferies has done what Totten would like to do and yesterday he was
trying to extend the deals which brought Bruno and Eskilsson to
Scotland. The Hearts manager and chairman Robinson were holding talks
with both men, and Robinson indicated that he may be able to announce a
successful conclusion to the negotiations today.
Rousset has signed until the end of the season while the others, even
on their present contracts, will be available for the derby game on
Sunday.

Falkirk 2, Hibernian 0
IT was as if Hibernian had put aside Saturday's performance especially
for the bleakest of November afternoons. Their contribution at
Brockville was dismal like the elements as they once again fell to what
is a Falkirk jinx.
For the seventh match running, Alex Miller's side failed to beat
Falkirk, and hopes that the Edinburgh club could mount a serious
championship challenge after such a promising start to the season must
now be put on hold. Titles are not won by teams who would rather watch
the ball than play with it.
Last midweek, floodlight failure at Easter Road caused the
postponement of their match against Partick Thistle. On Saturday, it was
the players who were switched off.
Falkirk, stuck at the foot of the premier division beforehand, were
superior in every department, showing an eagerness to get involved and
playing some excellent football along the way. They also had Maurice
Johnston, whose two goals clinched victory and whose general play
delighted Brockville chairman George Fulston, who took a huge gamble in
bringing the striker from Hearts late last season.
Said the chairman: ''I've heard and read everything about how
difficult Maurice is -- that he's done this and done that. I can tell
you, he is a joy to work with, and I haven't had the slightest bit of
bother with him. He is doing a tremendous job for this club.''
Manager John Lambie would agree. He said: ''Mo and David Elliot were
superb, but it's all about team work and that was a great team
perfromance -- the best performance over 90 minutes since I came here.''
Lambie, however, will not sit back and bask in one victory. In fact,
he will shortly be knocking on the chairman's door for more money for
the transfer market. He said: ''While I am pleased with the effort of my
players, I'm looking to get some competition about the place and that
means I'm still looking for a couple of new players.''
While spirits were high in the Falkirk dressing room, Miller emerged
from a talk-in with his players, grim faced, but in no mood to let them
off the hook. ''We were deservedly beaten, because we were second to
everything,'' he said.
''I felt we allowed Falkirk to put us under pressure too easily, and
we when we received passes, our thoughts were negative ones.
''Darren Jackson was the only one willing to drive at players. We had
one shot on target the whole afternoon -- that's how inept we were.''
Hibs lost striker Keith Wright with a hamstring injury just before the
interval and the influential Michael O'Neill was absent because he was
on duty with the Northern Ireland international squad, but Miller was
not looking to those factors for excuses.
Falkirk always had the upper hand, but remained edgy and nervous
throughout the first half. But with just two minutes of the second half
gone they got the break they deserved, and carved out a marvellous goal.
Mo Johnston took a pass from Forbes Johnston in the centre of the
field and sent David Hagen scampering up the right wing. Hagen outpaced
Joe Tortolano and drilled in a low cross to the far post where Mo, who
had raced almost 60 yards, came sliding in to shoot high past Jim
Leighton.
You could almost see the pressure lift from the home side, and with
Hagen and Elliot dominating the wide areas Falkirk never looked like
losing their lead. They put the match out of the reach of Hibs in 72
minutes with another superb goal.
This time Paul McGrillen made the opening with a cute back heel to
Elliot, whose shot came bouncing back off a post. But Johnston was first
to the rebound and he hammered in his sixth goal of the season.
It was a refreshing performance from Falkirk, who had come off two
tough away matches against Rangers and Aberdeen. For Hibs it is one
their fans will want to forget quickly.

Partick Thistle 1, Celtic 2
MAYBE the irony was lost on them in the midst of their passion, but
the few hundred Thistle fans who staged a ''sit-in'' did look a little
incongruous making their protest against the board as they sat in the
splendour of the #2.3m stand which is there as a consequence of the
board's motivation.
The other irony would have brought back memories for the opposition
fans as they made their way home in the rain; the Jags rebels were
chanting an old favourite of the Celtic supporters, ''Sack the board,''
just after their side had been dumped by the Parkhead lot.
Perhaps these few Jags fans have some grievance, but if they really
think there is anyone around who will buy out Jim Oliver and put sacks
of money the way of manager Murdo MacLeod, they are indulging in
self-deception of a foolish kind.
Oliver may have a low level of tolerance, but no-one can argue with
the progress, indeed the survival, of Thistle under his tutorship, and
the protesters might just be doing themselves no favours if they drive
their chairman into apathy. He is not far away from that stage now, but
he has put #2m into the club and is entitled to protect that investment
as best he can.
It might be in his own interests to meet the ringleaders of the
protest group, even if he is not enamoured by their methods, and let
them know the ABC of keeping a club like Thistle afloat, never mind
finding millions to buy players.
The team did well against Celtic, showing the determination, courage,
and application that have helped them consistently to defy the odds, and
kept them in the top division.
MacLeod believes they can do it again if they play like this, and his
realistic aim is to increase the size of the squad which currently is
stretched to its limit. He expects to bring in a couple of new players
this week, but kept quiet about their identity. However, they will not
be part of swop deals.
''Since Ian Cameron became the last man to re-sign, the interest in
swop deals from outside has dwindled,'' he said, ''and we are not going
to bring in anyone who will break the bank with wage demands.''
There was not much wrong with his team against Celtic and, if they
were forced into retreat much of the time, they never flinched under the
pressure, and fought back so well when given the chance that they might
just have stolen a point.
Celtic, as is their wont these days, played aggressive, exciting
football and, unlike their blank day against Raith Rovers, this time
managed to come up with an end product. He is called Pierre van
Hooydonk, and he had not been the flavour of the month with the Parkhead
fans. He is now, after scoring the two goals that won the day.
His team-mate, defender John Hughes, gave an insight into the
tribulations of strikers when he talked of his pleasure at Pierre's
double. ''I shudder to think what would happen to me if the ones I miss
were treated the way a striker's misses are. I would be slaughtered.''
Hughes did make a mess of a couple of good heading chances from set
pieces and admitted that he would need to file the edges of his dome.
The former Falkirk player is enjoying the relatively late opportunity of
playing in the big-time atmosphere at Parkhead.
''I definitely am playing with more confidence,'' said Hughes, who is
being eyed as a possible Irish international candidate, before adding a
quaint observation for a man who gets up well to high balls, ''but I am
determined to keep my feet on the ground.
''It certainly is the best spell of my career. When you go into
Parkhead and see Lisbon Lions walking about you know it's a good place
to go to your work.''
He has done his homework, too, pointing out that Celtic had virtually
abandoned any hope of the championship about this time last year. Now
they are four points behind Rangers, with the Old Firm game coming up
next Sunday.
It was to both teams' credit that they managed a game of some
excitement, considering the wind and rain that swept across Firhill all
the way through. From the moment Paul McStay cleared a Steve Welsh
effort off the line in the first minute, there was the promise of
goalmouth incident.
However, the battle waned for a while until Celtic took the lead in
great style. McStay fed John Collins down the left and his brilliant
chip from the bye-line was met with great authority by van Hooydonk, who
gave Nicky Walker no chance.
Thistle's equaliser was quick and incisive, even if it needed a mix-up
between Hughes and Tommy Boyd as they each tried to halt Wayne Foster.
The ball broke clear as a result and there was young Stephen Docherty
taking it in his stride, running on 15 yards and then fairly hammering
it past Gordon Marshall.
Celtic's winner was the consequence of a beautifully flighted
free-kick by Andreas Thom to van Hooydonk who leaned over to nod it into
goal.
That proved enough, but Thistle never gave up hope of anoher equaliser
even if Celtic held the upper hand most of the time. ''Apart from losing
a sloppy goal, I thought we did well in the difficult conditions,'' said
their manager, Tommmy Burns, ''We had to try to please those fans who
stood out there in that weather. They are an inspiration, wonderful
people.''
Meanwhile, over in the relative comfort of the new stand, rumblings
were being heard. Strange old business, is it not?

PARTICK Thistle want to sign former Rangers midfielder Robert Prytz on
a free transfer.
The 35-year-old has kept his house in Glasgow since initially leaving
Ibrox in 1985.
Malmo have granted him a free, but only if he returns to Scotland.
But a complication has cropped up with the Swedish side now demanding
a #100,000 fee, with Young Boys of Berne ready to move in.
Prytz, who has played in Switzerland, Germany, and Italy, as well as
Scotland and Sweden, said: ''The vice-chairman offered me a free
transfer as a thank-you for two-and-a-half years with the club.
''I left last week with good feelings. But I have been told I was only
getting a free if I returned to Scotland.
''I have already had informal talks with Murdo MacLeod at Partick and
Raith Rovers manager Jimmy Nicholl.
''I am now awaiting the next stage.''

Raith 0, Motherwell 0
MANAGER Alex McLeish, his patience exhausted at the start Motherwell
have made to the season, is ready to move into the transfer market to
bolster his side.
While a succession of injuries have contributed to the Fir Park club's
slump to fourth-bottom place in the premier division, there is no doubt
that the inconsistency shown by several players has jeopardised their
futures.
The goalless draw with Raith Rovers at Stark's Park convinced McLeish
that he must bring in new players to strengthen his stricken squad.
The first-half injury to defender John Philliben added to the mounting
problems and McLeish revealed yesterday: ''He has damaged ankle
ligaments and we now have 10 players out injured.
''The situation is so serious that I must think about going into the
transfer market. There isn't a million-pound cheque available so I will
consider exchange deals.
''It was an atrocious day for football at Stark's Park, which is never
an easy place to come to. The defence showed they could dig in when we
were under pressure. Indeed, we could have nicked a win.''
Even allowing for the missing stars, Motherwell looked a pale shadow
of the side which finished second in the championship last season.
Veteran sweeper Miodrag Krivokapic will now be suspended for what
seemed a harsh ordering off just two minutes from the finish. He was
booked for a tackle on Stephen Crawford, even though he was elbowed in
the face. He was then red-carded by Edinburgh referee Andrew Waddell for
arguing about the incident which left him with a facial injury.
Crawford later claimed the blow was accidental and such an experienced
official, who was well positioned, showed precious little awareness or
common sense.
Motherwell midfielder Paul Lambert, one of their few successes, took
an optimistic view despite such a bleak display. He insisted: ''If we
keep applying ourselves like we did, then we will turn the corner, as we
have so many players to come back.''
There was no similarity between the Raith Rovers side which played
with such flair and distinction in the UEFA Cup and the one which ground
out their third point from their last six games.
That will be a source of some comfort to their manager Jimmy Nicholl,
who called for more resolute qualities when his side wobbled alarmingly
in the wake of their defeat by Bayern Munich.
Only an outstanding display by keeper Scott Howie prevented the Fifers
claiming victory.
Nicholl admitted: ''It was not a very good game to watch. Both teams
are capable of better than this..''

ALEX Bone has looked the part ever since his arrival at Stirling
Albion from St Mirren and no-one could doubt his contribution on
Saturday, when he assisted in one goal and scored the other in the 2-1
home win over Stenhousemuir.
This fixture has become a local derby with an edge, with both clubs
again having justified hopes of promotion after near-miss experiences
last season. Kevin Drinkell was sure to have Albion ready for this
tussle and they duly brought the new winners of the Challenge Cup back
down to earth.
Second-half goals by Ian McInnes, from a Bone cross, and by the busy
front player himself proved enough of a cushion against a last-minute
consolation by Adrian Sprott direct from a corner.
That victory took Stirling up to joint-second beside Berwick, who,
with nine first-team men injured, could be content with a goalless draw
at home to Clyde. The Bully Wee had more of the play but suffered a
setback with a red card for Tommy Harrison after a second booking late
on.
The opening of Stranraer's new stand was not a memorable occasion --
another goalless encounter, against Queen of the South -- but East Fife
extended their lead to seven points with a 2-1 victory at winless
Montrose. Ayr stayed second-bottom, losing at Forfar by the same score.

THERE were more fans locked out of Livingston's Almondvale Stadium on
Saturday than used to watch the team play at their former home,
Meadowbank.
The kick-off was delayed for 10 minutes to allow the capacity crowd of
4000 to be seated. Even then, the queues continued to snake out from the
turnstiles and into the unfriendly elements before the news of
disappointment was broken to 1000 or so unlucky fans, who were left to
make the long, wet return to cars parked two or three clouds away. But
for them, there is another home game next Saturday.
Injury-hit East Stirlingshire managed a 1-1 draw against the leaders
but did not spoil the party. Livingston manager Jim Leishman observed:
''Football is about creating history, upsets, and memories that you
cherish. I'm sure a lot of people will cherish today.''
Even the rain did not dampen the enthusiasm of a town which, like the
gridiron game in the USA, had benefited from the movement of a senior
football team franchise. Chairman Bill Hunter's judgment was vindicated
by Scotland's seventh-largest crowd of the day.
Steven McLean equalised Jason Young's earlier strike for ''Livvy''
and, on goal difference, 'Shire moved above Albion Rovers, whose Charlie
Speirs collected the club's sixth red card of the season in the 4-1
defeat at Cowdenbeath.

WALTER Smith will return from his mission in South America some time
today and he is unlikely to have secured a deal to bring another player
to Ibrox. That is unfortunate, because Rangers, despite the arrivals of
Paul Gascoigne and Oleg Salenko, are in great need of fresh talent and
drive.
There is never any shortage of effort or passion in their play, but
Rangers have been performing badly. Often it looks as though they are
without direction, invention, and pattern. Perhaps the catalyst is to be
found in South America.
Smith missed Saturday's match against Aberdeen because of his trip,
and until he chooses to reveal the identity of his target, speculation
will run wild. Already it has been suggested Rangers are in pursuit of
either Argentina's Ariel Ortega or Brazil's Caio, but neither of these
players took part in matches on Saturday night and that was when Smith
watched his man.
It is understood the target has captured the imagination of Italian,
German, and Spanish clubs also.
Smith's desire to brighten his team's play is understandable; the
club's failure to speak out against the behaviour of Gascoigne is less
comprehensible. The English internationalist lasted little more than an
hour against Aberdeen and during that time he gave no more than a
display of petulance.
Gascoigne snarled and stamped his feet and threw his arms about. He
didn't like decisions and he was unhappy that Aberdeen players had the
audacity to tackle him or even chase him. One wonders if this obviously
confused person will ever grow up.
Someone should tell him the ball isn't his, he can't alter the laws of
the game to suit his own mentality, and it might help if Smith took him
to one side and gave it to him straight.
People keep saying Gascoigne is in possession of a wonderful talent
and that we should make allowances for him. Nonsense. Since arriving in
the premier division, Gascoigne has done no more than act like a child,
but it will take more than a good skelp on his backside to cure him.
Something will have to be done because the more we see of this player,
the more obnoxious he becomes, and it also seems that his fitness is
declining with each match he plays. Why should this be? Is Gascoigne
doing all that he should to make sure he gives Rangers his best?
It is obvious the electric burst of pace which used to carry him away
from defenders has been lost during a long period of inactivity while he
recovered from a variety of injuries, but he has to understand that
elbow-powered escapes are illegal. They are also dangerous and more than
one Aberdeen player felt the sharpness of his elbows.
Indeed, Paul Bernard had to have five stitches inserted in a facial
wound after having come into contact with Gascoigne.
Also, Gascoigne, who found that John Inglis would not be shaken off,
reacted angrily by lunging with his head in the direction of the
Aberdeen player and it was fortunate for both that contact was with
Inglis' abdomen. Does Gascoigne not realise that there is a footballer
in jail partly because he used his head in the wrong way?
The referee, John Rowbotham, should have started the correction
process by sending him off, but the official, it has to be said, was
negligent and the fact Gascoigne stayed on the pitch might only convince
him that he is indeed above the game's law.
If referee supervisor Don McVicar, who was present, reports any of
these incidents, Gascoigne could face action from the SFA.
It would help also if players who should know better, players like
John Brown, for instance, didn't indulge ,either. Brown became involved
in an incident with Billy Dodds, who had kicked Alan McLaren, and it
appeared Brown lifted a hand to deal with the Aberdeen player. Dodds and
Brown should have been sent off and McLaren booked for his own reaction,
but no-one was punished.
Rangers really must tidy their act -- and soon, because they have
crucial matches coming up against Celtic next Sunday and then Steaua
Bucharest.
''These are big games and performances of late have been poor,'' said
Stuart McCall, who played well on Saturday. ''We've got to improve
quickly.
''We know we are not playing as fluently as we can, but we are going
into a match (against Celtic) which should give us all a lift. No-one
needs to tell us our play has not been good enough, even though we are
scraping results, and we are aware that we will have to produce better
to beat Celtic.
''After that game, we can look to the match against Steaua and, even
though it may be crazy that while we have only one point from a possible
12 in the Champions' League we could still qualify, we have to make sure
we go into the final match, against Borussia Dortmund, with a chance.''
Brian Laudrup could be fit to play against Celtic, and he certainly is
expected to be ready in time to be used in the Steaua match. His return
should help the cause, and McCall added: ''It's down to us and we are
beyond the stage of talking. We have not been good enough yet and we
know it.''

Scotland A 9, Western Samoa 26
THE only Scot who will take some succour from yesterday's mightily
impressive performance by the Samoans at Hawick yesterday is the man who
sells the tickets at Murrayfield.
On the basis of this Mansfield Park display by the Samoans, they are
now, for sure, going to give Scotland the kind of game which, as World
Cup quarter-finalists, should always have been the case but on the
evidence of their stuttering performance against Edinburgh in midweek
seemed unlikely.
The side they put out yesterday is, the injured Brian Lima aside,
likely to be the Test line-up and on this form they could give any side
-- certainly in the Northern Hemisphere -- a damned good run for their
money.
Possession is the name of the game. Without the ball a side is
confronted with a mountain to climb, and by virtue of the dearth of
quality ball which came their way in Hawick, the Scotland shadow side
had a hill of Everest proportions to surmount.
The Scots were under pressure at scrummage and lineout. On the
touchlines, in particular, the Scottish main jumpers, Stewart Campbell
and Ian Elliot, were badly shaded. At one point early in the game, four
or five Scotland lineouts went against the throw.
Again, in contrast to Wednesday, the barrage of high tackles which, to
an extent, disfigured the game against Edinburgh, were conspicuous by
their absence. Perhaps this had more to do with the fact that Scotland
rarely had the opportunity to run hard at the Samoans or, perhaps, it
merely indicated that the Samoans had realised that if they had
persisted, then they were going to be penalised off the park as the tour
progressed.
Scott Welsh, the Hawick stand-off who was making his debut at this
level, had trouble finding touch early on but, on at least a couple of
occasions, he spotted the slenderest of gaps and both times he went for
it.
Derek Stark, out on the left wing, had a couple of good runs,
particularly a 40-yard touchline dash with Gary Armstrong in support,
and in defence -- the area where his detractors say he is found wanting
-- he did all that was asked of him.
Later, Armstrong, who was captaining the side in his first
representative game for 20 months, said that, on a personal level, he
had just been glad to be back but would have been happier still if the
comeback had been accompanied with a win.
''I'm disappointed with the result. We were under pressure up front
but the boys deserve some credit for the way they tackled and for the
way they stuck at it,'' he said.
Scotland A coach Graham Hogg added: ''We just didn't get enough
possession. We defended well but you can only defend so long. The
Samoans had obviously stepped up a couple of gears from their outing
against Edinburgh.''
With the first of his three penalty goals, Scott Welsh kicked Scotland
A into the lead after 16 minutes. The tourists equalised five minutes
later when Darren Kellet -- who had a personal tally of 16 points --
slotted home a penalty goal.
Welsh put Scotland back in front six minutes later but in the
twenty-ninth minute Kellet had a penalty to level terms once again.
Scotland conceded two soft penalties -- Stark diving in after the
tackle and Welsh trapped offside -- within three minutes but were let
off both times as Kellet kicked the ball wide of the posts.
Just before half-time, Armstrong and Sila Vaifale traded punches --
the Samoan flanker impeding Armstrong after a scrum -- the Samoans were
penalised, and Welsh kicked Scotland A into a 9-6 half-time lead.
Ten minutes into the second half, a Stark break and fine following-up
by Armstrong deserved a try but, when the Samoans were penalised,
Welsh's penalty effort flew wide.
Five minutes later the Samoans conjured a try from nothing when
Vaifale stormed over and Kellet converted.
By now the Samoans were well in command and another Kellet penalty
goal saw the game slipping away from the Scots.
The Samoan fly-half then added a drop-goal when poor lineout work by
Scotland was cruelly punished.
Scotland were nothing if not big-hearted and made a couple of forays
back into Samoan territory only to see themselves back on the rack after
slipshod handling.
The Samoan skipper, Pat Lam, one of the classiest acts on display, had
a try two minutes from the end, which Kellet converted, to hand the
South Sea islanders an emphatic victory and to set them in good heart
for both North and Midlands tomorrow night, but more particularly, for
the Murrayfield Test on Saturday.
Scotland A -- S D Lang; H R Gilmour (both Heriot's FP), S A Nichol
(Selkirk), I C Jardine (Stirling Cointy), D A Stark (Boroughmuir); W S
Welsh (Hawick), G Armstrong (Jed-Forest); G D Wilson (Boroughmuir), D G

SCORERS: Scotland A -- Welsh 3p. Western Samoa -- Kellet 3p, 2c, 1dg;
Vaifale 1t; Lam 1t.
* THE Scotland international squad were issued with contracts at
Murrayfield at the weekend but they remain unsigned as the players'
lawyer is casting an eye over them.
* SCOTLAND'S centre-pairing for Saturday's Test match against Western
Samoa sat out the contact sessions during a training stint at
Murrayfield yesterday. Graham Shiel and Gregor Townsend are both nursing
shoulder injuries from their club games on Saturday but, said national
coaching director Jim Telfer yesterday, both are expected to be fit by
the weekend.
* THE Scotland replacements for the Test match against Western Samoa
at Murrayfield on Saturday, named after the Scotland A game at Hawick
yesterday, are: Hugh Gilmour (Heriot's FP), Ian Jardine (Stirling
County), Gary Armstrong (Jed-Forest), Stewart Campbell (Dundee HSFP),
John Manson (Stirling County), and Graham Ellis (Currie).

THE Chinese have a lot to learn about golf and yesterday in the final
round of the Heineken World Cup at the Mission Hills club in Shenzhen,
Scotland and Sam Torrance were the victims of their ignorance when the
European No.2's ball disappeared mysteriously on the eighteenth hole.
''I'm sure some so-and-so picked it up,'' Torrance said. ''I'd pulled
my drive a touch but it pitched on the top of the hill, kicked left and
we never saw it again.''
The pink-shirted Scot was driven back to the tee in a buggy -- it was
hot and steamy -- and eventually holed from four feet for a bogey 5 to
finish with a 69 and a total of 271, 17 under par. ''As far as I'm
concerned I birdied the last,'' Torrance said, ''but I'm not sour, I'm
just a bit sad. It happened to Frank Nobilo in the third round and you
just have to accept it.''
Nobody saw the ball at rest, and the little lad who triumphantly
discovered one in some long grass had found a Prostaff, not Torrance's
Titleist, so Scotland slipped from a share of second place with
Australia to a tie for third with Japan on 558, 18 under par. That was
15 shots behind all-conquering Americans Fred Couples and Davis Love,
who equalled the record of four wins set by Arnold Palmer and Jack
Nicklaus in the 1960s, although those two legends never won four in a
row.
Had the Scottish team of Torrance and Andrew Coltart finished joint
second they would have won around #16,000 each more than they actually
did.
As it was, they won #37,5000 each and Torrance was also third in the
individual event, earning himself another #16,600 to take his season's
earnings over the #900,000 mark -- and he still has big money
tournaments to come. This week he is playing in the Hong Kong Open with
a skins game in Macau to fit in.
Coltart, who struggled on the greens and was one under par overall,
was furious with himself for not giving his captain more support, but at
least he finished in red numbers.
Hiroshi Goda, of Japan, was three over and his struggles were
constantly in the spotlight because Hisayuki Sasaki, who set a course
record of 62 in the first round, lost the individual title to Love only
at the fifth hole of a sudden-death play-off. They both finished on 267,
21 under. Final scores:
543 -- United States (D Love III 65, 67, 68, 67; F Couples 68, 69, 70,
69).
557 -- Australia (R Allenby 68, 73, 68, 70; B Ogle 70, 71, 69, 68).

559 -- New Zealand (M Campbell 69, 71, 67, 68; F Nobilo 73, 70, 70,

69).
570 -- Wales (M Mouland 68, 74, 71, 70; P Price 73, 70, 72, 72).
580 -- England (M Roe 68, 69, 72, 73; P Broadhurst 73, 74, 76, 75).
588 -- China (Z Lianwei 75, 74, 68, 75; C Jun 76, 74, 74, 72).
INDIVIDUAL
267 -- D Love (USA) 65, 67, 68, 67; H Sasaki (Japan) 62, 69, 67, 69
