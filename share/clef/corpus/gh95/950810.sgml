A BOY footballer was in hospital in Inverness last night suffering
from meningitis after falling ill at an international youth tournament.
Fraser Munro, 13, was the second youngster out of 600 taking part in
the competition -- held last week in Devon -- to fall victim to the
potentially fatal brain disease.
The other boy, a 13-year-old from Kansas, is making a good recovery in
Plymouth's Derriford Hospital.
Health officials in Devon stressed yesterday that they thought it
unlikely that one boy had infected the other by coming into contact with
him on the football field.
Dr Noel Olsen, the area's public health officer, said: ''It is
probably just a coincidence. We have absolutely no evidence of any
connection other than the fact that they were both playing in the same
tournament. The chances of one getting it from the other are extremely
remote.''
The Devon health authority has been tracing people who were in contact
with the boys and treating them with antibiotics.
A spokesman for Raigmore Hospital in Inverness said: ''Fraser is in a
stable condition in our children's ward. We have followed up on his
close contacts, and they have been given antibiotics.''

PAUL Lawrie won his first 72-hole event in three years when at
Downfield yesterday he produced a remarkable final day's play to win the
inaugural #25,000 SPGA Masters title.
The Aberdonian looked only an outside bet when he began his morning's
third round in fifteenth spot, seven strokes off the pace. But closing
rounds of 65 and 66, which featured two eagles, 11 birdies, and no
dropped shots, destroyed the much-vaunted parkland course.
''I've started working with David Leadbetter recently and I feel what
he is telling me is starting to come good,'' said Lawrie. Leading
aggregates:
274 -- P Lawrie (unatt) 69, 74, 65, 66 (#3500).
275 -- A Crerar (Downfield) 65, 71, 71, 68; R Russell (Longniddry) 68,
68, 71, 68 (#2500 each).
279 -- D Thomson (Kings Links) 66, 71, 70, 72 (#1700).
280 -- D Scott (Letham Grange) 70, 67, 72, 71 (#1300).
282 -- B Marchbank (Auchterarder) 71, 73, 72, 66; A Tait (Cawder) 71,

* IT was black day for Scotland in the British Girls' Open at Northop
Park, Clwyd, yesterday. All of their five qualifiers for the matchplay
stages fell by the wayside, four going out in the opening round.
Only Heather Stirling survived the first obstacle -- and she only did
so at the expense of another Scot, Claire Hunter.
Stirling started as favourite in her second-round match against Gemma
Scase and for a time it looked likely that Stirling would progress. She
was one up at the turn, but then lost two holes in a row and any thought
of a revival was short lived, going down 2 and 1. Results involving
Scottish players:
First round -- L Walters (Ormond Fields) beat L Moffat (W Kilbride) 2
holes; H Stirling (Bridge of Allan) beat C Hunter (Deeside) 2 and 1; G
Scase (Orsett) beat V Laing (Musselburgh) 3 and 2; J Krantz (Sweden)
beat F Lockhart (Balbernie Park) 3 and 2. Second round -- Scase beat
Stirling 2 and 1.
* TITLE holder Stephen Carruthers, previous winner Richard Williamson,
and former semi-finalist Mike Ready tied for the top qualifying place in
the Highland Open at Pitlochry yesterday.
Stuart Main, a 14-year-old from Thornton, was only one stroke further
behind. Qualifiers:
140 -- S Carruthers (Pitlochry) 68; R Williamson (Royal Jersey) 68; M
Ready (Old Fold Manor) 68. 141 -- S Main (Thornton) 69. 142 -- T McLevy
(Blairgowrie) 70. 144 -- D Hamilton (Australia) 71; G Carter (Ladybank)
70. 145 -- N Panton (Pitlochry) 74; M Armstrong (Swanston) 71. 146 -- J
Rutherford (Pitlochry) 66; B Mitchell (Thornton) 73; M Niven (Pitlochry)
76; A Kelly (Dunwhinny) 72. 147 -- D McKay (Tarbat) 75; J Stevenson
(Seahouses) 74. 148 -- G Hewitt (Parklands) 72; S Butler (South Herts)
72; J Campbell (Pitlochry) 73.
149 -- J Lawrence (Bloxwich) 72; J Sanaghan (Thornton) 72. 150 -- I
Scott (Shetland) 76. 151 -- A Crabbe (Kingsknowe) 79; I Hayward

FIRST-round draw:
Bell v McKay; Sanaghan v Main; Lawrence v Ready; Stevenson v Taylor;
Mitchell v Scott; Hayward v Richardson; Williamson v Kelly; Douglas v
Butler; Hewitt v Niven; Campbell v Carruthers; Hamilton v Cameron; Smart
v Armstrong; Curran v Miller; McLevy v McDiarmid; Rutherford v Panton;
Carter v Crabbe.

THE World Championships ended in pain and tears of frustration here
last night for Yvonne Murray, but for fellow-Scot Liz McColgan, there
was a dramatic return to the international stage, with a battling,
sixth-place finish behind the Portuguese 10,000 metres winner, Fernand
Ribeiro.
It was only the second time in 15, head-to-head races, stretching to
1985, that McColgan had beaten her arch-rival.
Murray, Scotland's Commonwealth 10,000m champion, fell after eight
laps of the final, and although she regained her feet, she was last.
Seven laps later, she dropped out.
She sat in tears, her right knee bloodied, shaking her head in
disbelief. ''I belived I could win,'' she said. ''I can't put into words
how disappointed I am.''
Elana Meyer had just launched a break, with McColgan close behind.
Murray, slightly further back in the field of 20, alert to the danger,
moved too quickly in attempting to cover the threat.
The Olympic champion, Derartu Tulu, and an Italian, Maria Guida, were
directly in front. They reacted more slowly, and Murray simply ran into
the back of them, clipping Guida's heel, and crashing.
''I knew Tulu was the big threat, and I was dogging her,'' said
Murray. ''It is the first time I have fallen on the track. I was badly
winded -- that's why I took so long to get up.
''I tried to keep the head, get back into a rhythm, but I was soon
cramping in the stomach. The damage was done. To train all year for that
. . .
''My right leg is cut, and my right side grazed and bruised.
''Next race? I can't even think about that now.'' However, she did
speak of a half-marathon debut, possibly the Great North Run, which may
mean another showdown with McColgan.
Dundee Hawkhill's McColgan initially said: ''I'm sick. That wasn't a
good race.'' But on reflection added: ''It's only my fourth track race,
including a heat, in three years. On just nine week's track training, I
suppose I can't complain.
''I can get a lot stronger. But it shows that at least I am back. I'll
be running a lot more track in future. Zurich next week? I'll need to
talk to my coach. No, I'm still not telling you who she is. I don't
discount doing the 10,000m in the Olympics next year.''
She will run the marathon in London, in April, and avoiding another in
Atlanta, would make commercial as well as practical sense.'' McColgan
revealed that in her heat, Ribiero had clipped her damaged left leg
consistently.
''I needed treatment on it three or four times a day. That got inside
my head, and played havoc.''
Ribiero out-sprinted Tulu to win in 31min.04.99sec, the ninth-fastest
time and the world's quickest this year.
Tulu clocked 31-08.10, with Kenyan Tecla Lorupe third in 31-17.66.
McColgan, wearing the shoes she had won in four years ago, recorded
31-40.14 -- 26 seconds slower than her winning time then. Good enough to
show that rumours of McColgan's demise are premature.
Michael Johnson recorded the second fastest 400m time ever, 43.39, to
take the first step towards what would be a unique World Athletic
Championships double.
The American held one of the biggest winning margins for any
championship one-lap race when he beat the world record holder, Butch
Reynolds, (44.22), with Jamaican Greg Haughton third in 44.56.
Britain's Mark Richardson finished fifth in a personal best of 44.81,
with Roger Black seventh in 45.28.
Johnson, who begins his 200m challenge at 9.40am today, said: ''Maybe
I can break the world record (43.29) later this year when I am a bit
fresher going into my races.'' That could be in Zurich on Wednesday.
He is supremely confident of doing the double: ''The biggest obstacle
is having to get up that early in the morning . . . The job is only half
done. There is nothing to celebrate -- I'll just have a massage, get
something to eat, and then bed.
''I was disappointed to see the time so close to the record -- you
think you should have gone out just a little harder. It's kind of
upsetting, but I'm pretty pleased with the second fastest time in
history.
''The fire is still burning -- If I'd lost here, the fire would be out
for the 200.''
Even the world's 100m men will not be exempt from the heat of
Johnson's supercharged sprinting. He warned: ''Possibly in future I'll
take a year out, and dedicate it to the 100 -- to getting under 10
seconds. I'm confident I can do that.''
Sergei Bubka qualified comfortably for today's pole vault final along
with the only other two six-metre men, Okkert Brits and Rodion
Gataullin. Britain's Neil Buckfield was eliminated with 5.55m.

THE most reassuring outcome of the US PGA championship, which begins
at 6.40 this morning at the Riviera Country Club near Los Angeles, would
be victory for one of the 14 European professionals in the 150-strong
field -- but, given the weight of history and present trends, not the
most likely.
Both the European tour itself and morale for next month's Ryder Cup
match against the United States would benefit enormously.
Now that Nick Faldo, Seve Ballesteros, and Ian Woosnam do not, at
least for the time being, seem to be the forces they were, the role of
White Knight has fallen on Colin Montgomerie's broad shoulders, which
have to carry that least wanted of burdens, the label of being the
highest-placed player on the Sony world rankings not to have won a major
title.
Having twice come close to winning the US Open, Montgomerie said:''The
key for me is to let it happen and try not to force the issue. I know
I'm good enough and healthy enough, and I've been playing well enough
this year to be just justifiably confident.''
For a year, however, Montgomerie has lost the art of winning,
coinciding with a time when more and more players have become capable of
doing so. In Europe, 26 tournaments have been won by 22 players and 10
by newcomers to the experience. On the US tour, 25 players have won the
31 tournaments, although only four for the first time.
American players have won the first three majors -- Ben Crenshaw,
Corey Pavin, and John Daly, who form a group for the opening 36 holes --
and if, as all the evidence suggests, one of their countrymen is
successful on Sunday, it would be the first year since 1982 that all
four champions were American-born.
It is doubtful whether any of them has, in the space of 22 years since
he took up the game at 16, hit as many as seven million shots, the
number which Faldo has taken the trouble to calculate. Whatever else
this astonishing statistic tells of his general approach to the game, it
surely confirms his singular preoccupation with its mechanics.
Faldo, who will surely be one of the only two wild-cards available to
Bernard Gallacher, has declined the captain of Europe's request to play
in one of the last two counting events after this one in order to
promote himself from sixteenth on the points list to an automatic place
among the first 10.
Previous commitments prevent him from doing so. ''We are in a
pickle,'' Faldo said resignedly. ''Myself and others among the leading
European professionals asked Ken Schofield (the tour's executive
director) back in March to make more room for manoeuvre and allow at
least one more captain's selection, but he refused.''

AUSTRIAN OPEN
THE lure of an Alfred Dunhill Cup place has persuaded Paul McGinley to
make a late entry to the Austrian Open, which starts in Litschau today.
The Irish line-up for October's world team event at St Andrews will be
finalised after next week's Czech Open, but two of the three places have
already been decided.
Darren Clarke and Philip Walton are already assured of cup places. The
third spot is between Eamonn Darcy, Ronan Rafferty, and McGinley.
Whoever of this trio finishes highest in the order of merit after the
Czech event will play at the Old Course.
''I wasn't going to play in Austria,'' McGinley said. ''But after
Eamonn jumped ahead of me, I didn't have much choice. I've played in the
Dunhill Cup in the past two years and I'm really keen to make it three
in a row.''
McGinley and Rafferty will not be the only golfers with a special
incentive. Another is Mark Davis, who has won this event twice -- his
only two PGA European Tour victories.

Rangers 1, Anorthosis 0
THE European Champions' League jinx which has hovered over Ibrox for
the past two years reared its ugly head once again last night.
The Scottish champions were able to score just one goal against the
Cyprus title-holders in their first leg, preliminary round tie, and
suddenly the spectre of defeat at the first hurdle will haunt Rangers
once more.
The Ibrox side went into the game as massive odds-on favourites.
Their summer spending spree seemed to have pushed them even further
ahead of their opponents last night, even though Anorthosis had been
boosted by three Bulgarian signings in the close season.
There was never a thought of defeat among the 43,519 fans who packed
the stands. This was a night when they were ready to acclaim their
heroes -- Paul Gascoigne, and last year's sensation Brian Laudrup.
It did not work out that way, even though Gascoigne almost played
himself into a first minute coronation with a free kick which the
Cypriot keeper saved superbly.
As for the rest of the performance, it was notably disappointing.
Neither Gascoigne nor Laudrup could produce the performances to match
their reputations.
That was where Rangers fell down. They did not have the invention
required to bring them success against a Cypriot team which defended
with determination and with discipline.
That was the indication of how things were to go for the Ibrox men.
They had chances, but they had much more frustration than success.
Rangers had been warned before this preliminary-round European Cup tie
that they could not take the Cypriot champions for granted, and the
events at Fir Park just 24 hours earlier must have increased any
forebodings there may have been at Ibrox. By half-time, the worries, the
anxieties, had increased.
Early in the game, it had looked as if Rangers were going to control
the match. They began well, urged on by the capacity crowd, and yet,
eventually, they began to sag, becoming caught up in the defensive web
set by the Cypriots and their Bulgarian coach.
Afterwards, manager Walter Smith admitted: ''I always felt it was
going to be an awkward game for us. That is how it turned out.
''Their marker, Kiriakov, did well against Paul Gascoigne, but you
have to remember that it's some time since Paul had 90 minutes at this
kind of competitive level.
''We had our chances, and we might have taken them. We are not
despondent. There have been other games here where we have lost away
goals. That has not happened this time which is a positive sign for us
before we travel to Cyprus.''
Rangers had their best period of the game in the second half when they
had abandoned their three at the back defensive formation, taking off
Brian Reid, and pushing on Gordon Durie to give them an extra attacker.
It was a ploy which worked, and one which the Cypriots' Bulgarian
coach, Georgi Vassilev, admitted: ''We had problems with that change.''
Certainly, it was Durie who scored, and that goal after 68 minutes
arrived after a period of intense pressure from Rangers.
In 61 minutes, Laudrup and Gascoigne combined to give Ian Ferguson an
opening. He shot wide.
Just afterwards Gascoigne was involved again when Stuart McCall
chipped beyond the post with Laudrup waiting for a pass just yards from
goal.
McCall was off target again before Charlie Miller replaced Ferguson in
66 minutes.
Two minutes later, Durie scored the only goal of the night. Gascoigne
sent McCall clear, he gave Durie a glimpse of goal, and the substitute
turned on the ball to hit a low shot under the Cypriot keeper, and
suddenly Rangers had the lead they wanted.
Before the end, Brian Laudrup missed two chances, McCall missed
another, and Mark Hateley saw a header go down towards the line and then
bounce over the bar.
They all might have counted, they all might have made the trip to
Cyprus less hazardous.
But, then, there were moments when Andy Goram proved that he's
returned to his best.
Twice before half-time he made saves which confirmed that Scotland
manager Craig Brown should have him back at Hampden against Greece next
week.
There was one save from Nikolai Dodorov, and then another from
Valentin Ignatov from a free kick, which lesser keepers would never have
reached.
The Bulgarian, who manages Anorthosis, Georgi Vassilev admitted: ''I'm
not certain we are through. I know that Rangers can play better than
they did tonight.
''When they brought on Durie at the start of the second half, they
gave us problems and I know they are capable of giving us further
problems when we meet them again in two weeks' time.
''They are not a team I would ever want to say are defeated.''
But Rangers will travel to the Mediterranean island knowing that
Atletico Bilbao lost there 2-0 last year.
However, Walter Smith had a message of hope for his club, and for the
fans, when he pointed out: ''We are not scared of the second leg. We
have a team who are capable of getting goals away from home. That is
what we will now look for.''
RANGERS -- Goram, Wright, Robertson, Gough, McLaren, Reid, McCall,
Gascoigne, Ferguson, Hateley, Laudrup. Substitutes -- Durrant, Thomson,
McCoist, Durie, Miller.
ANORTHOSIS -- N Panayiotou, P Panayioutou, Andreou, Castanas, Panayi,
Kiriakov, Assiotis, Stavrou, Gogic, Todorov, Ignatov. Substitutes --
Charalambous, V Melanarkitis, Chrisiomoriou, A Melanarkitis, Shimitras.
Referee -- E Blareau (Belgium).

WHEN it all happened on Tuesday, a rumble echoed over the land as that
massive concrete rugby lump called amateurism shattered messily on the
floor. I nearly dropped off my chair.
I phoned Brian Williams, the president of Glasgow Southern. ''It means
that clubs will be tempted to pay players to keep them,'' he said.
''Ambitious clubs like us need to become top clubs as soon as possible
to survive.''
Steve Hirini, the GHK captain, thought it was good news. ''The
financial rewards will give players an extra incentive at club level,''
he said.
Brian Simmers, the former international stand-off and chairman of the
sports section at Glasgow Accies, wondered how far it would go. ''What
will the commitment be? Will the age group players be contracted to the
SRU eventually? I worry about the career paths of the youngsters now.''
My mind flashed, in utter and dedicated sympathy of course, to Will
Carling, whose plight has illustrated what will happen to rugby players
when they get more famous. All this hullubaloo over chatting to Princess
Di, what with her calling him ''captain'' and him calling her ''boss''
isn't just titillating. It is a storm cloud that should demonstrate to
the players that they will have to keep on their toes. And not those of
Princess Di.
See, the big problem for a group of individuals wanting to be paid is
that when they do get money, they may have to be judged with that in
mind. You can't say: ''Gosh, weren't our chaps super losing by 50
points.'' Never mind they're not amateur any more, the fact of the
matter is that if I, as a spectator, know that Mr X is getting 35 grand
to walk on to Murrayfield, then I expect Mr X to have done everything
possible in his life to help him win for Scotland. Everything.
Footballers, for example, have found to their cost that the presence
of money in their sport puts them into a different sphere of attention.
The public feel that they own them and they can look into their private
lives as often as they like.
The good old rugby tour, and its off-the-pitch happenings have long
been the subject of conjecture. Way back in the mists of time, a New
Zealand lady published an article in a newspaper with a headline
proclaiming mockingly that ''Lions are lousy lovers'' after deliberately
ensnaring some unfortunate tourist with too much drink in him into her
arms.
Rugby players will now be subjected to that kind of scrutiny. They now
lose the romantic and cosy cushion that amateurism has given them. If
the nation pays, whether by increased ticket prices, sponsorship, or
just goodwill, then it will expect.
I was asked the other day if I now wished I was 10 years younger.
Heck, I've been wishing I had been 10 years younger since I was about
23, but I'm eternally grateful that I played rugby when I did. It was
magic. There is something good about talking to people who have more to
their lives than sport, and there's something sad about hearing
sportsmen talk of ''battling in the first half'' and ''scoring from two
yards'' -- just my distance.''
Great players like Craig Chalmers, Gary Armstrong, and Rob Wainwright
now have the potential to earn money, see places I never saw, and
achieve the kind of fame that I and my colleagues hardly glimpsed. In
some ways, I envy them insanely yet think they're worth every penny. I
hope they milk as much from it as they can.
But in other ways I thank my lucky stars that I'm 37, decrepit, and
completely past it. For the young Scottish rugby players of the future,
Freddie McLeod's announcement that sounded like loads of money, also
meant loads of pressure.
They must prepare for it now.

' I've got another year of international rugby in me and as the deal
becomes clearer, it could make me change my mind. That is, of course, if
they wanted me '
KENNY Milne, Scotland's recently retired hooker, would consider an
international comeback if the price was right and the selectors wanted
him.
However, the news that Milne, 33, who retired after the World Cup in
June, would entertain thoughts of a return, is only one facet of the
continuously moving target that the game has become amid the frenzy of
professionalism and rebel circuses.
Today in Cape Town, with echoes of the High Court battle that followed
his attempt to hi-jack the game of Test cricket -- Kerry Packer, or more
specifically Ross Turnbull's World Rugby Corporation -- will seek legal
backing for their claim that 28 Springboks have run away to the circus
and that the South African RFU no longer has any claim on their
services.
The game is in a state of flux and yesterday, in addition to Milne's
assertion that he might be tempted back, it emerged that the continuing
uncertainty has delayed an announcement by millionaire businessman John
Connor on the destination of the pot of gold that he wants to place with
a Scottish club.
Additionally, soundings among the clubs in the wake of Tuesday's
wholly welcome announcement from Murrayfield that Scottish
internationalists will -- IB permitting -- be placed on the same
financial footing as rivals elsewhere, indicated concern that they would
like to know where they will stand when their international players are
placed under contract to the SRU.
Yesterday, as Milne digested the news that Scottish international
rugby is likely to turn professional, or at least semi-professional, he
said: ''First of all, I want to say that I'm quite happy with my
decision to retire. I'm 33 and the time was right. I reckon, though,
that I've got another year of international rugby in me and as the deal
which the SRU are talking about becomes clearer, then it could make me
change my mind. That is, of course, if they wanted me.
''Realistically, I'm sure that the selectors will be wanting to look
forward over the next four years to the World Cup in 1999 and,
obviously, I won't be around at international level then. But if the
Union wanted me to come out of retirement then, given that there now
seems to be a reasonable amount of money on the table, I would certainly
consider it.
''I would have to say, though, that the sum being talked about of
#35,000 doesn't really make much sense if they are going to put 50
players under contract. Much more realistically, I would reckon the
figure would be in the #15,000 -- #20,000 range,'' said Milne.
Meanwhile, Connor has admitted that he, too, had been given reason to
pause and consider as a result of the continuing financial uncertainties
surrounding the game.
Connor, who has sold his business for what he said yesterday was a
''good few million,'' was to have made an announcement last month about
which club -- Watsonians and Boroughmuir are the only two contenders --
is to receive the #200,000, or thereabouts, which he wants to put up.
''Obviously, we don't want to make any move until we find out whether
or not any Scottish players are involved with the World Rugby
Corporation thing,'' said Connor. ''Before we commit funds to any club
we need to know if Scottish players are involved and what will be the
SRU's attitude.''
Yesterday, too, in the wake of the SRU's professionalism announcement,
the clubs were beginning to wonder what it means to them. Most of the
top sides are in the process of formulating trust funds for their
players. Specifically, many wonder what the SRU contract will mean
vis-a-vis the relationship between the club and the ''signed up''
internationalist, and what will be the distinction between ''work''
carried out for the club trust fund and its international equivalent.
Hawick secretary John Thorburn said: ''We're still digesting the
implications of the SRU's announcement but already many of us can see
areas which could lead to problems.
''There are obvious conflicts if an international player is doing
personal appearances, or whatever. If his club has a trust fund where
does the fee go? Additionally, I think many clubs would like to know if
they are going to benefit from all this new cash because, after all, it
is the clubs who make the international players.''
Meanwhile, the likelihood of the World Rugby Corporation circus
becoming reality was dealt another blow yesterday when Ireland's
international players denied that any of their squad members had signed
up.
The denial came in response to a newspaper report that some players
had committed themselves. The squad has been approached by the WRC but
the statement stated: ''No Irish rugby players have signed any contract,
agreements or letter of intent with WRC or any other body.''
The statement was issued following discussions between the squad's
five-man representative committee and the IRFU, which was made aware of
its contents before its release.
The squad's representatives are captain Terry Kingston, Brendan
Mullin, Nick Popplewell, Philip Danaher, and Denis McBride. IRFU
president Syd Millar described the squad's response as: ''sensible and
responsible.''
Similarly yesterday, Wallaby Test players Jason Little and Pat Howard
signed contracts with the Australian Rugby Football Union, rejecting
offers from WRC.
Little said he also turned his back on lucrative offers to switch
codes to play professional rugby league in favour of a three-year
contract with the rugby union establishment.

ALEX Penman finished Raith Rovers' big day the same way it had
started. An hour or so after the chairman had watched his team secure a
place in the first round of the UEFA Cup by beating Gotu IF of the Faroe
Islands by 4-0 on Tuesday night, he was back scurrying around Stark's
Park making sure everything was in order, anxious that everyone's needs
be accommodated.
However, that didn't extend to his players, and it was typical of him
that even though swollen with pride at what his team had achieved, he
preferred to strengthen his image as one of the game's more forthright
and bold club leaders.
Tony Rougier, the winger who had played a vital part in Raith's
successful entry into the European playground for the first time in
their history, was holding court in a corridor and the chairman passed
just as the player's conversation moved around to contracts. ''Don't ask
for a rise,'' he shouted. ''The only rise you'll be getting is if I put
a foot to your backside.''
Actually, his advice was offered in the language of the dressing room,
and Rougier received the message clearly enough. Like any chairman,
Penman strives to keep salaries relative to income, but if the
24-year-old Rougier, from Trinidad and Tobago, who is still rough around
the edges, continues to improve, he would be able to persuade Raith to
offer a contract suitable enough to make him stay on when his current
deal expires in a year and a half.
Capped more than 40 times for his country, where football is still
very much in its infancy, Rougier believes he has much to offer Raith,
and he talks of the club with a warmth which is refreshing in the modern
game. ''Raith Rovers are a small club, but there is a big heart here,''
he said.

CELTIC will attempt to put the past behind them tonight by taking a
healthy and bold step towards a brighter future when they come face to
face at Parkhead tonight with Liverpool, the side which sent Tommy
Burns' team into a deep depression eight months ago.
Then, Celtic, who were still in shock after their Coca Cola Cup final
defeat, went to Merseyside to play in Ian Rush's testimonial match and
lost 6-0.
Few around Celtic Park, which is regenerating into something splendid,
wanted to think back to the darkest of winters, but it was inevitable
some thoughts would shift into reverse.
Celtic's assistant manager Billy Stark said yesterday. ''That defeat
hurt us, but from reaching a real low, the players came back in the
remainder of the season.''
Now, with the Tennents Scottish Cup occupying pride of place at the
ground, and new blood coursing in the team, there is a growing
confidence that Celtic are taking better shape. Further evidence of a
steady improvement was offered in their 1-1 draw against Newcastle
United last Saturday, and Burns and Stark are expecting to see more
progress against Liverpool.
''We have stressed throughout the pre-season that everything is about
improvement and progress,'' Stark said.
''I'm not certain what team Liverpool will put out but I imagine it
will be close to their strongest, so Celtic will have another genuine
test.'' One disappointment is that the #8m Stan Collymore will not be
playing because of an ankle injury.
John Hughes will make his debut at the heart of Celtic's defence,
although his presence will not force Burns to push Tommy Boyd back out
to full back. The Scottish internationalist will continue in the middle,
and the chances are he and his team-mates will be busy.
Stark added that Celtic will use this, the last of their public
pre-season games, to refine tactics and shape for Europe which he hopes
will be a campaign rather than a brief adventure. Celtic need European
football for credibility and extra finance and Liverpool should test
their readiness.
Hughes is the only addition to the 15-man squad on duty for the
Newcastle match, but he has no concerns at all about facing such
highly-rated professionals. His confidence is astonishing given that he
has been no more than a journeyman throughout his career.
Celtic's other pre-season buy, Andreas Thom, also will start and Stark
hopes he will complete the 90 minutes. The #2.2m striker suffered cramp
against Newcastle, but his hectic pre-season fitness schedule was blamed
and he should be at his peak in time when the serious football begins.
They will, of course, start without their captain Paul McStay, but his
ankle operation was a success and the club don't expect him to be
sidelined for longer than a month. ''The report we had back was good,''
said Stark. ''Four weeks is as long as he will be out now.''

SCOTLAND striker Darren Jackson looked forward to a season of
challenge for Hibernian last night, and vowed that the Edinburgh side
was chasing the treble.
And that bold forecast was made despite the fact that manager Alex
Miller has had to watch the transfer market enviously, without a penny
to spend on new players.
The Easter Road side face the first big test of their readiness
tonight, when #5.2m signing Nick Barmby makes his debut for
Middlesbrough.
''He is an outstanding player at the very highest level and his
inclusion at Easter Road will make sure that we are stretched in the
game,'' said Jackson.
''It would have been nice if we had been able to recruit a big name as
well but stadium work has had to take priority.
''However we have always worked as a unit and now we have another full
season to develop as a team. We may be missing a new face, but we're the
most settled side in the league.
''Everyone is predicting Rangers have won the league before it starts,
and even the bookmakers have stopped taking bets, but we don't have to
believe that.
''We'll start off the season aiming to win all three major
competitions, and within the current squad at Easter Road there is a
deep seated belief that we can.''
It was Hibs' form away from home that saw them slip behind in the
chase after Walter Smith's team last season with just three victories
from 18 matches.
''If we can further develop as a team in the new season and improve on
that dreadful away record, I believe that the current squad has what it
takes,'' stressed Jackson.
The former Newcastle and Dundee United striker leads the Hibs attack
tonight but misses out when QPR visit on Saturday as he joins up with
Craig Brown's squad for the European Championship tie against Greece.

GEORGE Fulston and John Lambie yesterday brought a smile to the face
of Scottish football in general, and Falkirk in particular, when the
club chairman formally introduced the former Partick Thistle manager as
Brockville's new technical director of football.
Fulston and Lambie once formed a volatile partnership at Hamilton, and
yesterday there was nothing to suggest that the passing of the years had
mellowed either.
Asked if we could expect something similar this time around, Fulston
grinned and said: ''We've had our differences in the past and, no doubt,
it will happen again. We've certainly had our days. Listen, I almost
burned his pigeon loft, I once threw him out of my car -- and I even
threw him out of his own house at a party one night.
''But I'm delighted that he has decided to join me at Falkirk. John
has fighting qualities. He eyeballs you -- and after the fortnight I've
had, I find that very refreshing.''
Said Lambie: ''I'm happy to team up with George again. There are times
when John Lambie needs his backside kicked, just like certain players
do.''
In the past 10 days, Fulston has had to stand back and watch as his
manager Jim Jefferies joined Hearts and club captain John Hughes headed
for Celtic. ''You could say I was worried about the morale at
Brockville,'' he said. ''But now that John is here, that should all
change.''

HASSIBA Boulmerka, with a cutting edge as keen as the desert sirocco,
blew away the world 1500 metres title hopes of British army sergeant
Kelly Holmes last night.
Boulmerka, Algeria's Olympic champion and the 1991 world title-winner,
surged to the front with 280m remaining, and held off Holmes to win in
4min.02.42sec. The Briton, who had shadowed her rival, drew level at 200
metres, attempting to challenge around the outside, and was within a
stride of the Algerian with 100m to go. But Boulmerka covered the final
200m in 29.5 to 30.1 by Holmes who finished in 4-03.4.
Boulmerka's fitness was suspect -- she had completed only one race
this year, and fell heavily in her last outing, in Monte Carlo. Holmes,
on the other hand, was unbeaten until coming to Sweden.
Boulmerka brushed aside questions about Muslim fundamentalist reaction
against her -- they perceive her figure, clad in shorts, to be an
affront to the Koran. But it is a fact the plane in which she arrived
from Frankfurt was subject of a bomb threat.
The only woman in Algeria's team, Boulmerka was moved out of the
athletes' village, into a hotel. Her team-manager, Mohamed Gouasami,
denied this was for security reasons, and brushed aside suggestions that
she is shadowed by four bodyguards.
Nevertheless, Boulmerka, who has refused to bow to demands that she
wear an all-enveloping Muslim women's garment, said her victory was
significant. ''It is important for all women, particularly the women of
Algeria,'' she said.
Since she became a figure for feminist liberation in her country, the
number of women taking part in athletics has increased. Of 1300
participants in her country's national championships, 60% this year were
women.
Holmes, a sergeant in the No.1 Household Division Army Youth Team,
will race again, in the 800m, provided she suffers no reaction.
''I have stomach cramp,'' said the Commonwealth 1500m champion. ''But
that's probably just dehydration. I can't be disappointed. Though I came
with my sights set high, and wanted the gold, it's one of the best races
I have run.
''I'll go into the 800m still very strong. There are some good
athletes out there, but I'm as good as any of them.''
Holmes has a reputation as an iron woman, beating Marines in races and
having run before despite suffering agony from an ovarian cyst. ''The
reason I'm so hard is because I have to bully 14st men around,'' she
says. ''You have to be as fit as them to earn their respect.''
Heike Drechsler, having failed to claim a long-jump medal for the
first time in five world championships, now has bowed out of the
heptathlon.
The German, who has won 10 medals in world and Olympic championships,
limped out of the Ullevi stadium after the shot, failing to line up for
the 200m, final event of the opening day. Defending champion Jackie
Joyner-Kersee already had gone home before the start, acceding to an
ultimatum from Al, her husband and coach, that she was not ready.
Svetlana Moskalets (Russia) leads with 3941pts, while Britain's Denise
Lewis, though back in fourteenth (3583) is 34pts ahead of her first-day
total when winning the Commonwealth title last year.
John Godina (USA), who won the shot title with 21.47m, also qualified
for today's discus final. Godina, whose best putt (22.00m this year) is
the biggest since 1991, could become the first man to achieve the
shot/discus double in a major championships since Bud Houser at the 1924
Olympics.

PERHAPS it is not so surprising that a country such as Finland, not so
very different in size from our own, with a population of #5m, should
react a touch excessively to a victory over a club from a country
heavily involved in international competition with themselves, writes
Ian Paul.
It seems that MyPa 47's 3-1 defeat of Motherwell in the UEFA Cup on
Tuesday has induced a kind of super confidence that the Finnish
international side will deal equally comprehensively with the Scotland
side when the countries meet in the European Championhip qualifying
match in September.
One man exemplified the attitude with which we are all too familiar
ourselves following an unexpected and thrilling win, the 21-year-old
MyPa international defender Sami Hypia who hopes to be in the Finnish
side that come to Hampden on September 6.
''I believe we have a great chance of beating Scotland.'' he said,
''Our victory over the second best team in the Scottish league will have
given everyone in our country a tremendous boost. If we do well against
Russia next week, we could come to Hampden with a lot of confidence
about winning.
''And if Scotland play like Motherwell, I will be celebrating again.''

TRADE for pedigree Charollais sheep at Lawrie &amp; Symington's specialist
sale in Lanark was very mixed with many breeders returning home
disappointed, often with several sheep which had failed to attract the
minimum bid.
However, the top end sold well, reflecting the fact that the best of
this breed is equal to any other. The two top prices of the day went to
ram lambs from the flock of James Kinnaird, Findatie, Kinross. His best,
a January-born third-prize winner, sold at 5500gns to Brian Atkinson,
Scratchmere Scar, Penrith. The first-prize lamb from the same flock sold
at #2700gns to a trio of Welsh breeders.
Next best at 2650gns was the second-prize lamb from John Hunter,
Cairnhill, Insch, Aberdeenshire. Reserve male champion at the Highland
Show, it sold to Blair Duffton, Mains of Drumdollo, Huntly and Charles
Shercombe, Duffins Farm, Worcester. At 1250gns Mr &amp; Mrs W Ingram, Logie
Durno, Pitcaple, Aberdeenshire sold to J Dargue, Kirkby Steven, Cumbria.
Another from the same flock fetched 1200gns to HL Nelless,
Thistleyhaugh, Morpeth. W Hyslop, West Logan, Castle Douglas sold twice
at 1050gns to Blair Duffton and to R &amp; J Andrew, Rowanston, Maybole,
Ayr. The female champion, a gimmer from Graham Reid, Netherallan,
Culross, Fife sold at 750gns to M Dougan, Ballymore, County Armagh.
Averages: four shearling rams averaged #393.75 -- down #3.15; 51 ram
lambs averaged #625.47 -- up #232.02 on 1994 when 70 sold; 32 gimmers
averaged #272.67 -- down #22; two ewe lambs averaged #330.75 -- up
#126.00. Auctioner -- Lawrie &amp; Symington.

<TEXT>
SOME British vegetable growers could face ruin if European Union curbs
on the use of nitrate fertilisers are introduced, MPs said yesterday.
Fears of a cancer risk have led the European Commission to call for a
limit on the use of the chemicals on lettuce and spinach crops.
Germany and Holland have already brought in new limits on nitrates,
but British growers, backed by the Government, have resisted the move,
claiming there is no scientific evidence that nitrates in vegetables are
harmful to humans, a view supported by leading cancer expert Sir Richard
Doll.
Now an all-party select committee of MPs has warned that any proposal
by the EU to put a ceiling on nitrate levels ''would prove devastating''
for British glasshouse growers of lettuce.
In the Commons agriculture committee report on horticulture, the MPs
observed that ''leafy green lettuces preferred by many UK consumers have
relatively high levels of nitrate and the lower light intensity in the
UK also pre-disposes to high nitrate levels''.
They also warned that ''Butterhead or round lettuce production in the
UK with an annual output of 48,000 tonnes, worth almost #32m to growers
and over #52m at retail level, would virtually cease if maximum nitrate
levels were imposed, with about 1300 growers affected.''
The MPs said the Brussels Commission had acted too hastily and they
backed efforts by the Ministry of Agriculture to ensure that any EU
decision be based on agreed scientific evidence. -- PA

GLASGOW is the 25th most expensive place in the world in which to rent
office space. At a total annual occupation cost of #27.75 per sq ft
(just enough space to park a waste-paper basket and not quite enough for
a fax machine) the city is more expensive than Downtown New York's
#24.13 per sq ft, Madrid's #19.67, and Los Angeles' #16.96.
According to the latest World Rental Levels Bulletin, produced by
international property consultants Richard Ellis, newly-emerging markets
dominate rental growth.
Bombay, Beijing, Shanghai, New Delhi, and Hanoi, have all seen office
rental increases since the beginning of the year. In contrast, in
Glasgow, London, Frankfurt, and New York, top rents have remained
unchanged over the past six months. Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Paris, have
all seen a fall in office rents.
''The world office market reflects the new world order,'' says Ted
Webster, managing partner of Richard Ellis Scotland. ''The extraordinary
economic activity of Asia and the Far East is reflected in higher office
rents.''
Richard Ellis estimates that a rental value of around #20 per sq ft
per annum is necessary to justify new office constructions in the
developed world.
''Scotland has not experienced the significant falls in rental levels
seen elsewhere in the UK. Headline rents in Glasgow have dropped back
from #20 to #17 per sq ft, and with other occupational costs makes a
total of #27 per sq ft attractive for a major European city. With less
than 100,000 sq ft of new development left in Glasgow, notable activity
has commenced in 1995 with major developments planned to the end of the
millennium.''
Meanwhile, rental growth figures for the month of July have remained
stable in all property sectors according to the Richard Ellis Scottish
Monthly Index, produced exclusively for The Herald.

AN accountancy firm has boosted Glasgow's traditional office core by
booking into refurbished premises in Blythswood Square, writes Stewart
McIntosh.
Following the recent refurbishment of 15/17 Blythswood Square by
Scottish Friendly Assurance, Rutherford Manson Dowds &amp; Co Ltd has become
the first tenant in the building.
The firm has signed a 15-year lease for the first and second floors
extending to approximately 6000 sq ft in total. An incentive package was
made available to the incoming tenant with the headline rental equating
to around #13.40 per sq ft.
Tony Bramley, investment manager at Scottish Friendly, said: ''We are
very happy to have concluded a letting so soon after the completion of
the refurbishment works, particularly to a firm of this calibre.''
Demonstrating its own faith in the development, Scottish Friendly
recently relocated its own headquarters into 16 Blythswood Square. The
letting means that only some 5000 sq ft is available to let in the
premises.
Glsgow moves ahead of New
York in office space charges
By STEWART McINTOSH
GLASGOW is the 25th most expensive place in the world in which to rent
office space. At a total annual occupation cost of #27.75 per sq ft
(just enough space to park a waste-paper basket and not quite enough for
a fax machine) the city is more expensive than Downtown New York's
#24.13 per sq ft, Madrid's #19.67, and Los Angeles' #16.96.
According to the latest World Rental Levels Bulletin, produced by
international property consultants Richard Ellis, newly-emerging markets
dominate rental growth.
Bombay, Beijing, Shanghai, New Delhi, and Hanoi, have all seen office
rental increases since the beginning of the year. In contrast, in
Glasgow, London, Frankfurt, and New York, top rents have remained
unchanged over the past six months. Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Paris, have
all seen a fall in office rents.
''The world office market reflects the new world order,'' says Ted
Webster, managing partner of Richard Ellis Scotland. ''The extraordinary
economic activity of Asia and the Far East is reflected in higher office
rents.''
Richard Ellis estimates that a rental value of around #20 per sq ft
per annum is necessary to justify new office constructions in the
developed world.
''Scotland has not experienced the significant falls in rental levels
seen elsewhere in the UK. Headline rents in Glasgow have dropped back
from #20 to #17 per sq ft, and with other occupational costs makes a
total of #27 per sq ft attractive for a major European city. With less
than 100,000 sq ft of new development left in Glasgow, notable activity
has commenced in 1995 with major developments planned to the end of the
millennium.''
Meanwhile, rental growth figures for the month of July have remained
stable in all property sectors according to the Richard Ellis Scottish
Monthly Index, produced exclusively for The Herald.

<HEADLINE>Allocation should be given up on retirement, says farmer. Call for rethink on sheep quota rules</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A BORDERS farmer, who has been a victim of the Government's system of
allocating sheep quota from the national reserve, yesterday called for
people leaving the industry to be forced to give up their quota rather
than use it as a means of financing their retirement.
Mike Orr is a new-entrant tenant farmer on the Duke of Buccleuch's
estate at Bowhill. His farm, Howford, had a quota allocation of 850 when
he assumed the tenancy in 1993, but that did not pass on to him with it.
When he tendered for the farm he believed he would be entitled to an
allocation from the national reserve -- a pool of quota held back by the
Ministry of Agriculture to meet the needs of people wanting to develop
their flocks. Eventually he hoped to achieve a full allocation.
However, he has still not received any quota and the decision by the
National Farmers' Union in England to seek a judicial review of the
Government's handling of the reserve has, although successful in court,
caused further delay. No early solution is expected while the Ministry
of Agriculture decides whether or not to lodge an appeal.
''If you are already in the system you are fine but new entrants like
me are penalised,'' he said. ''People who are seeking to develop their
flock might be looking for 100 units. I am looking for 850 and because I
do not have quota I do not get Sheep Annual Premium which means I am
losing #21 in subsidy for every ewe.
''It is really my bank which is keeping me going. Even if I do
eventually get a full allocation, a large slice of that will be eaten up
in the cost of borrowing.
''Meanwhile, we are being subsidised by the bank rather than the state
and the cost is crippling. It is affecting my whole business and no-one
can tell us when it will be sorted out. If the case is appealed to the
European Court, that could take two years. Do they honestly expect
people like me to be able to wait two years?''
He argued that it was unreasonable to expect someone taking over a
farm for the first time to be able to buy quota at current prices of
about #30 a unit.
Writing in The Sheep Farmer, he said: ''It is apparent to me that the
organisations which control and supposedly look after our industry are
run by established farmers with only their own interests, either
agricultural or political, at heart. Because there is such a small
percentage of new entrants we cannot possibly be represented fairly in
any democratic organisation, but I do feel the leaders of these
organisations have a responsibility to the small minority.''
A spokesman for the English NFU said it had advocated the introduction
of a buy-up scheme under which the Government would purchase quota and
add it to the national reserve. Part of the problem was that it had
failed to establish an adequate national reserve in the first place.
The judicial review was initiated because the legal advice to the
union was that the regulations under which the Ministry was operating
were faulty. There was, however, no legal ground for taking specific
action on behalf of new entrants rather than developers.

pay increases above the annual rate of inflation, according to the
latest wages survey by Incomes Data Services.
Hewlett-Packard staff, including 1100 at South Queensferry, have
received payments equivalent to 11.18% of their salary in the six months
to May under the company's profit-sharing scheme, which should yield
further payments in November. Last year, their average payments totalled
8.45%.
JVC has raised the starting rate for assembly workers at its East
Kilbride plant by 10%, with more than two-thirds of the production
workforce of 400 receiving increases of between 8.6% and 10% and just
under a quarter getting rises of between 6.3% and 7.1% from April 1.
Exacta Circuits has agreed 4.5% for its 470 employees at Selkirk and
Galashiels, while National Semiconductor's 1200 workers at Greenock have
received a flat-rate increase of #6.50 a week from April 1, which will
add 4.5% to the company's pay bill.
At AT&amp;T Information Solutions in Dundee, formerly NCR, a two-year deal
involves 4% increases from last March and again next March for the 1000
employees, who received similar percentage increases in March 1993 and
March 1994.
* The Scottish printing industry has conceded 3.7% increases for
around 10,000 workers employed in general printing and weekly
newspapers, while the Scottish woollen industry has agreed increases
covering 1500 employees in member companies who will see wage rates and
shift allowances improved by 3% and guaranteed minimum earnings increase

A MANAGER held responsible for a catalogue of faults at the Royal
Scottish Automobile Club has lost her unfair dismissal claim.
An industrial tribunal heard evidence earlier this year of the club in
Glasgow's Blythswood Square being more like a ''greasy-spoon cafe'' than
of the required four-star hotel standard.
Miss Nicoline Arcari, of Brackenrig Road, Rouken Glen, Glasgow, was
fired as food and beverage manager at the private Glasgow club on
December 19, 1994.
Giving evidence to the tribunal, Mr Timothy Kelly, who became chief
executive of the RSAC last year, said that when he arrived there were
serious problems with hygiene and he could have been prosecuted and
''heavily punished for permitting that type of standard''.
He said the food and beverage areas of the club were among the worst
he had ever experienced and placed responsibility with Miss Arcari.
Mr Kelly said he became concerned about Miss Arcari and her lack of
commitment to improvements in service and profitability.
When Miss Arcari gave evidence, she admitted: ''The club did progress
further than my knowledge or my background could cover.''
In its written decision, the tribunal noted that Miss Arcari received
her first written warning in April 1993 but ''generally speaking her
performance did not improve''.
When Mr Kelly arrived in July 1994, he saw a need for fundamental
changes.
The tribunal said: ''Mr Kelly concluded as a result of his experiences
over a period of months that the applicant was not responding to his
guidance or to his encouragement or direction.
''The applicant in his view appeared to display disinterest and lack
of commitment in regard to what he considered were reasonable
objectives.''
In deciding Miss Arcari was dismissed fairly, the tribunal said: ''We
are satisfied that the standards which Mr Kelly sought to achieve from
his staff were standards which were not unreasonable.
''And we can only conclude that the temperament of the applicant was
perhaps unsuited to the level of performance which the nature of her job
and responsibility required.''

THE output of Scotland's production and construction industries
continued to rise in the first three months of this year, according to
official figures released yesterday.
On a year-on-year basis, the overall Scottish output rise, at 2.1%,
was less than half the UK's 4.7%. However, Scotland's manufacturers,
with a 5.1% rise year-on-year, outperformed the UK as a whole (4.5%).
The latest figures have been subject to heavy revision from the
previous quarter, reflecting the regular annual adjustment for seasonal
factors and significant specific revisions to earlier data in the
mechanical engineering, electrical, and instrument engineering sectors.
Overall, the revisions inflate the figures in this particular index
series by an excess of 2% over what was published in May. The Scottish
Office is warning there will be more revisions to the second quarter
output figures, due in November, to take full account of a new system of
industrial classification, introduced in 1992.
There is some evidence in these output figures to support the Scottish
Council's claim that Scotland's manufactured exports dipped
significantly below expectations in the April-June quarter. The council
spokesman blamed the non-computer side of electronics for most of that
decline.
Output from electrical and instrument engineering (effectively the
Scottish electronics sector) grew by 23% in the year to March, more than
double the rise from the sector in the UK as a whole. However, Scottish
output appears to have peaked in the third quarter of 1994 and has been
in slight decline since. It fell by 1% in the first three months of this
year compared with the final three of 1994.
There has been a modest rally in output from mechanical engineering
since the third quarter of 1994. However, on a year-on-year basis in
that sector, output was down 11%, compared with a UK rise of 3%.
Construction output fell 5% year-on-year, compared with a 3% UK rise.
Without the impact of the electronics, manufacturing output has been
falling since early 1990 but there are signs of a modest rally in the
past four quarters.

A UNIVERSITY had a female bias when it came to jobs in its library, it
was claimed yesterday.
Part-time librarian James Digney told an industrial tribunal that he
had applied for eight or nine jobs at Glasgow's Caledonian University,
but all went to female applicants.
Mr Digney, of Nithsdale Road, Strathbungo, Glasgow, claimed the
university was guilty of sex discrimination. He said he was not
interviewed for some posts and claimed others were given to friends of
university employees without any interview taking place.
Mr Digney said he ''was a lot better qualified and had more relevant
experience'' than most of the women who were hired.
He told the Glasgow tribunal that the alleged discrimination had an
adverse effect on him. ''I've no confidence in myself and I worry a lot
and I'm on Social Security,'' Mr Digney said.
''I asked why it was happening and I wasn't given any reasonable
excuse.''
Mr Digney said matters came to a head when he applied for a post at
which he had experience.
He said: ''I'm alleging it went to a female because they have got a
female bias.
''They can deny it 'til they're blue in the face but I think it's
obvious.''
The tribunal was adjourned until today.

<TEXT>
AN NHS trust yesterday confirmed that a member of staff had been
disciplined for a #1m blunder which will lead to hospital jobs cuts.
The chief executive of the Highland Communities NHS Trust also
revealed that there was an additional #800,000 shortfall uncovered
during investigations into the error.
However, he refused to say whether suspended finance director Mr
Alastair Christie was being held to blame for the miscalculations in
budget negotiations with Highland Health Board.
Mr Christie has already been suspended on full pay for two-and-a-half
months over separate allegations of harassment made by two members of
staff.
But the trust's chief executive, Mr St John Hattersley, refused to say
if Mr Christie was the employee who would now be suspended over the
missing #1m.
In a statement yesterday, Mr Hattersley confirmed that job cuts would
follow among the trust's 2500 staff because of the blunder, but he
refused to say how many.
Mr Hattersley said: ''It is true the error was made in original
contract negotiations between the trust and Highland Health Board. We
have taken disciplinary action against a member of staff.''
Asked if the member of staff was Mr Christie, he replied: ''I am not
going to comment on who the action is being taken against.''
Mr Hattersley added: ''The error was for #1m, and that unfortunately
brought to light a further #800,000 shortfall. We are now in a position
to retrieve the financial situation.''
Details of the jobs to be targeted would be made available next week
after discussions with staff organisations.
He could not offer a clear timetable for job losses, but said job cuts
already agreed would be brought forward. These could take the form of
natural wastage and delays in filling vacancies.
Mr Hattersley said he was confident that standards of patient care at
the trust's 13 hospitals would be maintained.
Commenting on Labour's call for an independent inquiry, he said: ''Our
internal auditors are being used to provide validation of what happened,
and I don't see that an independent inquiry would add to that.''
Half of the missing #1.8m was a #900,000 deficit carried over from the
previous year. The balance was made up from the failure to meet
financial targets, a drop in miscellaneous income and the transfer of
funds to Highland Regional Council for the community care of mentally
ill patients.
Turning to the allegations of harassment faced by Mr Christie, Mr
Hattersley said: ''A decision on whether or not to take disciplinary
action has been made. But the outcome of the investigation cannot be
disclosed until all parties involved have been fully consulted.''
He confirmed that Mr Christie had been suspended on full pay for
two-and-a-half months, but denied reports that the allegations against
him were of a sexual nature.
Mr Hattersley said that two employees had tabled complaints against Mr
Christie, but would not disclose whether they were male or female. They
had been given paid leave.
News of any possible disciplinary action would not be disclosed until
today at the earliest, he said.

A DRIVER whose sneezing knocked out his false teeth crashed his car
while looking for them. Another motorist hit a pig and then had
nightmares of ''pigs flying and sausages driving my car''.
Then there was the insurance company rep who called on a man to
discuss claims and watched open-mouthed as he pulled out a handgun from
the side of the sofa, loaded it, and fired three shots into the ceiling.
AA Insurance yesterday revealed some of the improbable, amusing, and
hilariously inaccurate claims it has handled.
Others included:
* A claim that read: ''We note that your client made an excretia
payment of #350.''
* One that said: ''The front van Toyota reversed me. I horned her but
the driver did not response it.''
* An equestrian claim that read: ''The horse got up, staggered around,
and ran off to market.''
* Or the enigmatic statement that: ''At this moment in time our file
of papers is out of the office making inquiries.''

ACCEPTANCE of loss of market share in the face of pressure on premiums
meant Commercial Union's UK general insurance premium income dropped 11%
in the first half of the year.
But group profits still rose by a quarter to #246m, towards the top
end of expectations, and the interim dividend is raised by 6% to 10.7p.
CU shares dipped 15p to 628p.
CU believes that the decline in motor rates, which usually lead the
cycle, is probably coming to an end, though it is not as bullish as GRE
which last week forecast rising rates by the year-end.
''Private motor rates are bumping along somewhere near the bottom,''
said finance director Peter Foster. ''That's not to say there won't be
further rate reductions but I don't believe they will be that
significant.''
Over the past year, CU's household and motor rates have come back by
around 7[1/2]% with commercial property and motor 4% and 7% off
respectively. The group has been prepared to lose market share rather
than accept unprofitable business. Its motor account has come down 12%
in the past year to stand at 500,000.
Unlike many other major insurers, CU is not going all out to develop a
direct operation. It does have one based in Preston but will keep it low
key until rates pick up again.
The major insurers are showing greater discipline in the current
downturn compared with the last cyclical decline. Smaller companies are
being more aggressive and are gaining market share but from a low base,
so the larger operators are not too worried.
Information technology is enabling insurers to rate business more
accurately according to the risk, and Mr Foster expects the amplitude of
the cycle to flatten over time, though it will not be eliminated
entirely.
CU itself is at the peak of its investment programme in new computer
systems. As a result UK costs rose as a percentage of premiums, in
contrast to a decline in most other territories. Group chief executive
John Carter explained that the increase in the UK was offset by lower
claims costs.
All major overseas territories raised profits and global general
insurance premium income was up 19% at #2570m, largely as a result of
the inclusion of Groupe Victoire, the French company bought last year.
CU is pleased with the purchase, which was made as a long-term strategic
move.
Victoire is more of a life insurer and it resulted in a doubling of
life premiums to #1856m. The company contributed profits of #33m.
North America recovered sharply from profits of #7m to #30m, with
Canada moving from loss to surplus. Weather losses were lower overall,
despite a second-quarter increase in the US.

STANDARD Chartered yesterday pleased the City with half-time profits
soaring 35% to #319m as a result of the combination of cost control and
an increase in lending.
The bank enjoyed a big increase in mortgage lending in Hong Kong,
Singapore, and Malaysia, and an expansion of credit card business in
Asia.
A half-time dividend increase to 3.25p from 2.25p one year ago
accompanied the announcement of half-year pre-tax profits of #319m
(#237m last time). Earnings per share jumped from 14.7p to 21.6p.
Shedding jobs played a major part in its cost-cutting drive which,
together with other reorganisation moves, resulted in one-off costs of
#49m over the past 18 months. Profits were also helped by a bad debt
charge down from #69m to #30m. Standard Chartered shares jumped 27p to
387p.

STERLING'S perky performance looks set to continue according to City
analysts although the pound's movements are expected to remain closely
aligned to those of the dollar.
The pound has risen five pfennigs since late last month but yesterday
it closed at DM2.2494, a decline of almost [3/4] of a pfennig on its
overnight level.
The pound continues to benefit from the flight into higher-yielding
bond markets as investment risks such as fiscal problems, rising
inflation, and rocky politics, have diminished.
A further boon to the pound has been receeding political tensions
after the success of John Major in the recent Tory Party leadership
election.
The dollar showed signs of weakness but the pound was marginally down
against the greenback at $1.6010.

SCOTS exporters are among the most optimistic in the UK, according to
the latest Regional Trends Survey compiled by the CBI and Business
Strategies.
The success of Scottish exporters has raised general optimism among
businesses to its highest level for nearly two years. The previous
quarterly survey found a drop in export orders but this has been shown
to be a blip in an upward trend.
''Manufacturers' optimism about export prospects over the coming year
has surged ahead,'' the current survey reports.
The optimism balance of respondents (the percentage reporting more
optimism minus those reporting no change or less) jumped from 3% in
April to 32%, equalled only by the East Midlands.
The balance relating to improvement in export orders over the next
four months has risen to 40%, the highest rating in the country, though
the balance in respect of total orders was, at 16%, in line with the UK
as a whole. This is, however, a big improvement on the previous survey
which found the order position flat.
In line with this, while in the last survey output was said to have
dipped slightly in the past four months, a majority of companies now see
higher output. Manufacturing employment has fallen by 2000 or 2% in the
last four months, although firms indicate a lack of skilled labour will
become more of a constraint on output in the next four months.
Manufacturing capacity to meet higher export demand will not be a
problem as past capital investment coming on stream has led to a rise in
the number of firms reporting spare capacity. Those which are investing
are doing so less to expand capacity than to increase efficiency.
On costs, respondents indicated that unit costs were rising at a
slower rate than anticipated and they are expected to fall over the next
four months. Domestic prices are also projected to fall.

* DRINKING Japanese tea could help you get rid of the dreaded
''middle-aged spread''. French experiments have shown that green tea
contains a group of chemicals called methylxanthenes which, it is
believed, increases the metabolic activity of brown fat and yellow fat,
the kind that collects around us, even more. In a French experiment
involving 60 obese women following the same 1600-calorie diet it was
found that the green-tea group had lost twice as much weight after 15
days as a placebo group. After 30 days they had lost three times as much
as the control group. Green tea and capsules are available from most
health food shops.
* MIDDLE-AGED men who stop smoking also reduce their risk of getting a
stroke, especially if they smoked fewer than 20 a day. A study of more
than 7000 men throughout the UK aged between 40 and 59 found that those
who had given up smoking not only lived longer but were less likely to
have a stroke, says a report in Medical Monitor. Binge drinking, though,
not only raises the risk of a stroke but also increases blood pressure.
Yet another study, reported in the same magazine, reveals that nearly
one-third of all cancers are linked to smoking, ranging from lungs to
the mouth, cervix, pancreas and bladder.
* IF you go to your GP more than once a month perhaps you are
depressed. A study at Leeds University Centre for Research and Primary
Care suggests that a psychological assessment of those who visit their
GP frequently might be worthwhile in uncovering underlying depression.
* HORMONE replacement therapy, or HRT, continues to produce a steady
flow of research. The latest suggests that women aged 50 to65 who have
used this therapy had the same risk of developing breast cancer as
non-users of menopausal hormones, according to a study in the Journal of
the American Medical Association. Another research project says HRT can
help reduce high cholesterol if used in conjunction with a fat-reducing
diet. However, HRT was associated with a high frequency of breast
tenderness and bleeding, say researchers at the University of Texas.
Furthermore, a British study in Birmingham found that HRT increases the
risk of breast pain; and unless women were properly counselled this
could lead to them to stopping therapy because they associated the pain,
mistakenly, with breast cancer.
* IF you want to know if you are overweight take out the tape measure.
A team of Glasgow researchers has discovered that most men with a waist
measurement more than 102cm and women with a waist greater than 88cm,
are overweight. If this finding is confirmed it will simplify health
promotion, says an article in the British Medical Journal. As a nation
we are getting fatter despite all the advice to the contrary.
* MEN are more reluctant than women to visit their GP if they find an
unusual mole or skin blemish and this is reflected in a greater female
survival rate from skin cancer. A study from Yorkshire Cancer Registry
found that just over 60% of men survived for five years or more after
diagnosis compared with almost 90% of women.

<HEADLINE>Trading difficulties reported in North American activities ofShares fall after Rexam admits problems printing ad packaging group.</HEADLINE>

THE recent change of name from Bowater to Rexam has not got off to an
auspicious start with the printing and packaging group's surprise
revelation yesterday that it had run into trading problems in the second
quarter, hit by US weaknesss and destocking.
Only four months ago the annual meeting was told that trading
conditions continued by and large to be helpful and that Rexam's
European packaging and printing businesses were trading strongly and US
demand was good. The market naturally was quick to seize upon the about
face and investors saw their shares tumble 73p to 422p.
It would be nice to say that Rexam was just suffering a temporary blip
but it looks more worrying than that as the wide range of consumer
businesses which the company services on both sides of the Atlantic
reduce their demand. The problem area at the moment is mainly confined
to North America but problems there have been known to spread to Europe.
First-half profits have crept ahead, just, from #109m to #111m before
tax and exceptionals on sales on continuing operations 14% ahead at
#115m. On the same basis, operating profits were up 7% to #115m.
Rexam has lifted the interim dividend 5% from 5.8p to 6.1p, still
comfortably covered by earnings per share of 15.1p, up from 14.7p last
time. But analysts have reduced their full-year projections and Rexam
shareholders could have to wait some time for share values to recover
the lost ground.
The rise in sales reflects largely the raw material price increases
which have been passed on to customers. Rexam has, in fact, passed on
about 95% of its raw material costs over the past 12 months, something
that helped push profits up 6% last year from #212m to #226m and, when
reported in March, reassured the market that the company would be able
to ride the substantial price increases in paper and plastics of between
50% and 100% for many of the commodites purchased.
Those price increases were seen in the second half of 1994 and earlier
this year.
However, chairman Michael Woodhouse has had to do some embarrassing
back peddling. He said Rexam sees much flatter demand in the second half
as customers' stocks are run down and consumer demand in its main
trading areas is restrained.
Moreover, the beneficial effects of major investments that have been
made are not expected to achieve growth and lower costs until next year.
Profits for the full year are forecast to be close to last year with
better prospects next year. This, though, must be problematical given
the sudden, not to say dramatic change in the company's trading
situation in just a few months.
If the expected flatter demand in the second half lasts longer than is
apparently expected, than there could be further shocks in store.
Certainly the markets, caught badly on the hop, will need to see proper
signs of progress before Rexam regains its vote of confidence. The old
Bowater had made progress but the new Rexam will have to persuade the
City all over again that it can do the same.
Rexam said the increase in sales due to raw material recovery has put
pressure on margins as there has been no corresponding increase in
profits resulting on the return on sales being reduced from 9.9% to 9.3%
for continuing businesses.
So far as price increases are concerned, some comfort is taken in that
industry sources suggest that many commodity prices have reached a
plateau indicating a period of greater stability in the months ahead.
Customers had built up their stocks on fears of a continuation of price
rises in the pulp and paper markets so these stocks are being run down.
There is also a danger that declining consumer demand for goods which
use Rexam's wrapping may accelerate with all that entails for domestic
markets generally. Clearly this is a worse-case situation but after
yesterday's shock nothing can be ruled out.

HARRISONS &amp; Crosfield said yesterday that most of its diverse
businesses enjoyed a strong advance in the first half of the year.
Their improved performance boosted taxable profits to #66.4m from
#59.9m in the first six months of 1994.
''The 30% improvement in operating profits from our continuing
businesses is clear evidence that Harrisons &amp; Crosfield is back on the
growth track,'' said chairman George Paul.
Chemicals succeeded in recovering the cost increases which hit profits
at the end of 1994, as well as achieving higher sales in most markets.
''Conditions for timber and building supplies, on the other hand, have
become increasingly difficult during the period,'' the company said.
''Food and agriculture improved profits overall and plantations
recorded an outstanding result.''
The timber and building supplies division was hit by a 16% drop in the
number of homes being built in the US and, although sales in the UK were
higher, the rate of growth compared with last year declined
progressively.
Chemicals profits were up a third to #28.6m as a result of cost
cutting and increased demand, and the group's food and agriculture
business enjoyed an 18% improvement to #14.5m due in part to a strong
turnround in livestock pigs.
Investors will receive an unchanged interim dividend payout of 3.6p on
earnings per share of 5.7p against 4.6p.

CHEMICAL giant ICI announced yesterday it is to expand its European
production capacity for the plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) by
around 130,000 tonnes a year. All the new capacity for PET, which is a
material widely used in making bottles and other packaging, will be at
ICI's Wilton site in North-east England.
The programme will begin with a 10,000 tonnes-a-year upgrade of an
existing plant, with the new capacity coming on stream later this year.
This is to be followed by a 120,000-tonne plant starting up in the
fourth quarter of 1996. The new plant will cost about #80m and create 50
permanent jobs and employ some 400 people on its construction.
Industry sources expect demand for PET to grow at more than 10% a year
until at least the end of the century.
ICI, which already has a 100,000-tonne PET plant under construction in
Fayetteville, North Carolina,said both new plants would undergo further
upgrades after construction, bringing its worldwide PET capacity to
nearly half a million tonnes a year by 1999.

<TEXT>
RUSSIANS have developed such a taste for Vimto that canning of the
soft drink is due to begin in Moscow next month.
The move to local canning is part of an export drive by its producer J
N Nichols (Vimto). Vimto is now in the top 10 soft drink brands in
Russia and sales there are currently 63% ahead of target.
Exports have been a major priority of the group, with Vimto
International opening up nine new markets in recent months. The company
has recently started exporting to Indonesia.
In the UK, Vimto sales did well during the six months to June 30 and a
national television and radio advertising campaign for fizzy Vimto was
launched this week.
Pre-tax profits of the Manchester-based group, whose other businesses
include Nichols Foods and Cabana Soft Drinks, increased slightly to
#3.6m from #3.5m in the first half of last year.
The company blamed the modest rise on higher material costs and
developing a new factory.
Investors will receive an interim payout up from 2.25p to 2.33p on
earnings per share increased to 6.59p from 6.32p.
Managing director John Nichols said: ''Profit margins have been
squeezed by a 40% increase in packaging costs and several rises in the
price of sugar which, in tough market conditions, we have had to
absorb.''

Solicitor claims society ruined life and career.
A SUSPENDED solicitor who blames the Law Society of Scotland for
ruining his life and career, yesterday took legal steps which froze
#1.5m of the society's cash.
Mr Prem Shishodia hopes that the arrestment of the funds, in the hands
of the Royal Bank, will goad the society into a speedy response to legal
actions he has raised against it following his suspension last April.
He alleges that the delays in getting a hearing have been caused by an
abuse of the system by the society, which is the governing body for
solicitors in Scotland.
In March last year Mr Shishodia was fined #4000 by the Scottish
Solicitors Discipline Tribunal after being found guilty of professional
misconduct for breaches of the Solicitors Accounts Rules.
At the time he was running his law firm in Caledonian Crescent,
Edinburgh.
The complaints against Mr Shishodia stemmed from three inspections of
his books by Law Society accountants when shortages were discovered in
his client account. The rules stipulate that there must be enough funds
in this account to cover sums due to each and every client.
The tribunal stated: ''There was no suggestion of any dishonesty on
the part of Mr Shishodia, but he has shown an apparent disregard for the
precise requirements of the accounts rules.''
The following month, April last year, Mr Shishodia's affairs took a
severe turn for the worse when he was suspended from practice by the Law
Society for an unspecified period.
His plight was highlighted in April this year in a bitter dispute at
the Court of Session over the custody of his six-year-old son.
Awarding custody to the mother, Lord Gill criticised Mr Shishodia for
his ''selfish disregard'' of his wife's rights.
In a written judgment in the case, Lord Gill stated that following his
suspension Mr Shishodia was sequestrated in July 1994, with his
liabilities estimated at more than #110,000 (excluding debts to the Law
Society and other solicitors).
The judge said Mr Shishodia was now out of work, receiving income
support and child benefit of #86 a week and added: ''His prospects of
obtaining useful and remunerative employment are nebulous.''
Mr Shishodia confirmed last night that he had lodged a petition at the
Court of Session to challenge his suspension by the Law Society and
claimed he had been waiting more than a year for a hearing. He described
this delay as an abuse of the system by the society.
He has also raised a #1.5m damages action against the society. Asked
about the size of the claim he replied: ''How much is a life and losing
your family, business and home worth?''
He said he had become tired of the society saying to him: ''You are a
nobody and we have all the power,'' and decided on the authority of the
summons in his damages action to arrest #1.5m of the Law Society's funds
held by the Royal Bank.
''I expect them to run into court in the next day or two to try to
have the arrestment recalled or restricted.''
A spokesman for the Law Society confirmed the freezing of the cash,
adding: ''The matter is in the hands of our solicitors and I don't think
I would want to say anything further at the moment.''
Anyone who raises an action by way of a summons can move to freeze
funds belonging to the person being sued. This provides a guarantee that
there will be cash available to meet a successful claim and can be done
without seeking the permission of the court.
The defender can come to court to ask for the arrestment to be
lifted completely or for a cut in the amount of cash being frozen.

SCOTTISH Opera put on a brave face yesterday as it soldiered ahead
with its pre-Edinburgh Festival rehearsal of Dvorak's opera, The
Jacobin, minus its striking choristers.
Ms Roberta Doyle, head of press and marketing for Scottish Opera,
said:''Discussions are continuing between general director Richard
Jarman and Equity.''
The rehearsal, the final one in Glasgow before the production moves to
Edinburgh on Saturday for the dress rehearsal, took place in the Theatre
Royal, where, Scottish Opera reported, 18 choristers were on stage.
Of these, however, the opera company admitted, 11 were extra chorus --
not substitutes, but additional forces recruited to swell the ranks of
the full, 34-strong chorus, and therefore not involved in the dispute.
Of the other seven singers, two are members of the chorus though not of
Equity.
The remaining five, though now full-time company members, had not been
contracted to Scottish Opera at the time a ballot for industrial action
was called.
Equity, the chorus's union, yesterday confirmed that all those members
who were balloted for industrial action had not turned up for work.
Ms Doyle said: ''Scottish Opera cannot at the moment speculate on what
might happen on Saturday, or in relation to the performances on Monday
and Wednesday.''
The chorus's strike action yesterday followed its rejection of
proposals worked out by management and union with the conciliation
service, Acas. Despite the recommendation of the union, the choristers
displayed a lack of faith in the company's promises of additional money,
holidays, and improved conditions of service.
The chorus then held a secret ballot, rejected the package by a
majority, and began industrial action yesterday.

POLICE in Edinburgh have warned women to be vigilant after two city
centre incidents within the last 48 hours.
A spokeswoman said the incidents took place in St Andrews Square. On
Tuesday, a woman was followed by a man acting in a suspicious manner.
In the second incident, a woman was punched in the face by a man who
tried to steal her handbag.
The spokeswoman said: ''People, particularly women, must be warned
that at the height of the tourist season, they should be vigilant, not
carry large sums of money, and guard their handbags.''
0  Police are also hunting a man said to have indecently exposed
himself to children in Princes Street Gardens.
He is described as aged about 20 and was wearing a blue teeshirt with
the words ''Innocent Until Proven Guilty''.

<HEADLINE>Japan struggles with fears that economic miracle is over</HEADLINE>

Tokyo, Wednesday -- Is the Japanese ''economic miracle'' that rebuilt
the country from the devastation of the Second World War over?
Foreigners and Japanese alike are increasingly asking themselves the
question as the strengths that put the nation back on its feet threaten
to become weaknesses as a new century approaches.
''Japanese believed in the myth of the economic miracle. You might say
we were stupid, arrogant or naive,'' said Akitane Kiuchi, a former
diplomat and sometime government adviser.
Now those same Japanese who once believed the good times would never
end worry they may never return.
Behind the gloom are fears the interlocking pieces of the cozy
economic puzzle which provided Japan with social stability and growth
for much of past half-century are breaking apart. The changes may bring
welcome benefits to frustrated foreign businessmen and to oft-neglected
Japanese consumers, but policy-makers fear domestic costs will also be
great.
''For the first time, Japanese corporate interests do not always match
national economic and social interests,'' said a senior Japanese
official. ''What we need now is a new vision.''
Among the elements oft-cited as the key to Japan's post-war ''economic
miracle'' were management that provided job security in return for
life-long dedication to the firm, policies placing industrial
development above consumerism, and intimate ties among companies and
customers in which trust took precedence over more objective benchmarks
like price.
The ''Iron Triangle'' linking politicians, business, and bureaucrats,
while never as harmonious as many in the West believed, also oiled the
wheels of the economic machine.
Now the pressure of four years of economic stagnation, a persistently
robust yen and prospects of sluggish future growth are forcing business
to revise old ways in search of new profits.
Japanese manufacturers' efforts to shift output overseas and buy more
goods abroad to cut costs while trying to trim inflated payrolls, have
grabbed most of the headlines.
Change is also sweeping through Japan's byzantine distribution system,
often criticised as inefficient, costly and a barrier to new entrants --
but for those same reasons an employer of a hefty chunk of Japan's
labour force.
Worries have also emerged over the health of Japan's financial system,
burdened by heaps of bad debt acquired when the 1980's asset price
bubble burst. The economic changes have raised the spectre of a higher
jobless rate and the social woes that go with it.
''We cannot ignore the danger of falling into a 'high unemployment
society' if we make a mistake in our response,'' said Japan's 1995
Labour White Paper.
Unemployment, still low by most Western standards, hit a record high
of 3.2% in June. And, at least until Japan's fast ageing population
raises another problem, a serious labour shortage, the jobless rate
could rise yet further.
Public confidence in bureaucratic mandarins' ability to craft the
vital policy responses has plunged.
''The Class A War Criminals of the Heisei (1990s) Recession,'' said a
headline in a recent weekly magazine.
Among the ''criminals'' were a former chief central banker, a former
Prime Minister, a one-time top Finance Ministry official, and the former
chief government economist.
Adding to the anxiety is chaos which has continued in Japan's
political system since the conservative Liberal Democratic Party lost
its monopoly grip on power two years ago. -- Reuter

YOU are more likely to make a quicker recovery in hospital if you have
a ''view'', or can look at a painting of a landscape, rather than a
brick wall.
So says American research. This seems obvious but you have only to
walk into most hospitals to find that patients are confronted daily with
the equivalent of a brick wall -- usually acres of blank space painted
some insipid, institutional colour.
Unfortunately hospitals have for too long acted like huge ''illness
factories'', but there is a groundswell of opinion that supports
attempts to humanise them. Bringing in artists in is one way.
Pioneering this approach is the Dundee-based Health Care Arts, formed
in 1993 out of the former British Health Care Arts Centre. It is driven
by a holistic approach to the problems of institutional health care.
Elizabeth McFall, chief executive, says: ''The arts have a key role in
humanising both the health-care environment and the daily routine of
institutions, for the benefit of patients, staff and visitors.''
An example of the kind of work they do can be seen at the current
exhibition at the Smith Art Gallery and Museum in Stirling.
McFall admits that converting hospital bureaucracies to the advantages
of an artistic input into their environment is a struggle: ''Mention you
are going to put art into hospital and the immediate reaction is 'Oh,
you want to put a mural in?' ''
But today art in hospital can be anything from sculpture to glass
engraving, permanent paintings to ceramics.
A number of Scottish hospitals have already employed
artists-in-residence through this scheme. They include Queen Margaret
Hospital, Dunfermline (stained glass panels), Stirling Royal Infirmary
(ceramics), Strathcarron Hospice, Denny (engraved glass) and Perth Royal
Infirmary (tapestry).
Sometimes there are hiccups, usually traced to the fact that work has
been produced without consultation with either staff or patients.
Elizabeth McFall says: ''The most common reason for people not liking
a piece of art or craft which has appeared in their area is that they
were not asked if they wanted it.'' The organisation has learned from
their earlier mistakes and today all artists are heavily briefed on the
importance of consultation and planning before they step inside a
hospital.
It's too easy to step on the toes of sensitive, busy people who may
see the artist as an ''outsider'' intruding on an already over-stretched
system.
Apart from the work that the artist produces as a result of the
residency, there is another bonus which is more difficult to quantify:
it is the interaction of an artist with sick people.
Malcolm Miles, consultant with Healthcare Arts England, and former
director in Dundee of the British Health Care Arts Centre, explains:
''For patients and staff the artist can focus attention away from the
consequences of illness towards a more positive vision of life.
''Healthcare is changing. The patient is no longer seen as merely a
body exhibiting symptoms. A fuller range of emotional needs is being
addressed.
''Much of our thinking is mechanistic and it is easy to overlook the
simple human dimensions which actually make us what we are. Nowhwere is
this more apparent than in hospitals, most of which were built in the
post-war period and are too big, too daunting and lack any kind of
architectural grace.''
He believes that we now have a situation in which values are being
re-examined: the value of the patient as a person with emotional and
intellectual as well as physical needs; the value of decoration and
detailing, not just functionality, in buildings; and the value of
creativity in health care.
He says: ''We hear a lot of talk about the hospitals of the
twenty-first century. The growth of day surgery certainly means we will
see hospitals with fewer beds, some of which may be patient hotels.
''In all this change we have the opportunity to regain sight of human
dimensions; so there is ever more need to include craftworks which
demonstrate human ingenuity and skill.
''All societies have decorated their buildings -- except ours. The
demise of the 'brutalist' school of building design in favour of a more
colourful 'post modern' approach is to be welcomed.''
He hopes the next century may see a return to a more celebratory kind
of architecture -- artists, craftspeople, and designers will have a key
role to play.

AN eight-year-old girl has died after being shot in the chest at close
range by an air rifle pellet believed to have been fired by her
10-year-old cousin.
Police said the tragic accident happened as the children were playing
together yesterday lunchtime at a house in Bedworth, Warwickshire.
The girl, Margaret McEwan, of Ashington Road, Bedworth, was taken to
hospital, but was later pronounced dead.
Police and paramedics were called to the scene of the shooting at
midday yesterday.
''Initial inquiries suggest the girl was hit in the chest at close
range by an air rifle pellet as a result of a tragic accident involving
her 10-year-old cousin, James McEwan,'' a police spokesman said.
''The girl was taken to Nuneaton's George Eliot Hospital, where she
was later pronounced dead,'' he said.
Investigations into the tragedy were continuing today and a post
mortem examination was being arranged.
A report will be passed to the Warwickshire coroner.

New York, Wednesday -- MCI Communications said today that British
Telecommunications is in talks that may lead to its taking a stake in
MCI's newly-formed online venture with News Corp.
The online venture, announced earlier today, will providing consumer
and business information to Internet users.
''We are in discussions with BT (about a stake),'' Scott Kurnit, chief
executive of the so-far unnamed venture said. BT, the largest British
phone company, already owns a 20% stake in MCI for which it paid $4200m
last September. MCI in May agreed to a $2400m media alliance with Rupert
Murdoch's publishing and television group.
MCI has already spent $1000m for a 6.5% stake in Rupert Murdoch's
media empire, and is expected to double that stake for another $1000m.
MCI and News Corp are also spending $400m on an interactive media
alliance of which today's online venture is a part.

WOMEN in labour and premature babies feature strongly in Kate Downie's
work following her artist-in-residency at Rottenrow Maternity hospital,
Glasgow, an experience she found deeply moving.
''As far as I am aware only two other artists, Paula Rego and Joan
Eardley, have ever represented children and babies in their work,'' says
Downie, a well-established and popular artist, now in her mid-thirties,
''and never in a hospital situation.''
Downie's work forms part of a touring exhibition Next, currently at
the Smith Gallery and Museum, Stirling. Other artists featured are Annie
Cattrell, Ian Hughes, Katherine Pearson and Kate Robinson, who worked in
three other hospitals: the Royal, Edinburgh, Kirklands in Lanarkshire
and Knightswood in Glasgow.
Placing an artist in Rottenrow was both an innovative and adventurous
move, and the result is amply justified with some pioneering work that
stretches the visual frontiers and at the same time remains accessible
to all.
Downie, a figurative artist and graduate of Aberdeen Gray's School of
Art, is the daughter of a Scottish neurologist and nurse, so the idea of
working in a hospital environment did not faze her. ''I felt at home in
the situation. It was a rare privilege to be able to spend time there
talking to patients and staff, and drawing them.''
Prior to her residency she spent a lot of time establishing contact
with both staff and pregnant women, something that eventually paid
dividends. By the time she arrived people were not only prepared for her
but they had given written permission for her to draw and photograph
them.
She worked at Rottenrow for five weeks during 1993. One of the most
haunting collection of images to come out of the residency is the series
of drawings of premature babies in incubators, ''little scraps of life
hooked to machines''. It was both macabre and voyeuristic.
''I felt squeamish at first, and traumatised by the sheer fragility of
these premature babies,'' says Downie. ''I spent a lot of time there.
After all, this is a side of life that only medical staff and parents of
premature babies ever see.''
As a mother of two children -- Rachel, aged five, and Joe, aged one --
who had enjoyed trouble-free pregnancies she found the experience both
moving and harrowing.
Meanwhile her ''paper babies'', mobiles of babies in Pampers, and
monoprints of babies only 12 minutes old evoke a sense optimism, joy and
celebration of life beginning.
''Basically the environment was one of optimism, of new life coming
into the world, so I did not have to contend with the same sort of
problems that artists working in long-stay geriatric or psychiatric
hospitals face,'' says Downie.
She attributes the success of her stay to planning: ''I've been
involved in a number of such projects before so I did not make the same
mistakes again. I had meetings with senior officials weeks before I went
in. I met a lot of women too when they were coming to the ante-natal
clinics.''
She wanted to avoid the usual cliches of motherhood and chose instead
to do portraits of pregnant women's bellies in labour.
''The experience was akin to being shown the soft underbelly of
humanity within the rigours of a public institution. Initially it was
difficult to relate my previous art practices to the emotional and
physical realities of Rottenrow.''
* Next? artists, residencies and hospitals exhibition is at the Smith
Art Gallery and Museum, Stirling, until August 27then the Lillie Art
Gallery, Glasgow, through September.

A LABOUR MP is to write to BBC Director General John Birt over claims
that music programming is biased against Scotland.
Mr John Maxton, Glasgow Cathcart, will ask why the Scottish
International Piano Competition next month is not being televised.
Thirty-six entrants from countries including China, the Philippines,
Israel, Venezuela, America, Japan, and Russia will compete for the BT
Trophy and a #25,000 prize.
Mr Maxton's action was prompted by a constituent, Mr Lionel Hawes, of
Kingsacre Road, who said: ''Pianists from all over the world have been
taking part -- what will they think of us if they learn it is not on
TV?''
Mr Hawes, a social worker, went on: ''This is a competition of growing
international importance and should be given proper coverage.
''As a country hosting such an event, Scotland should have control
over its own television output. At the moment, the vast majority of TV
output is controlled from London. They are starving the rest of the
country, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, of their cultural events.''
Mr Colin Cameron, head of TV at BBC Scotland, dismissed claims of bias
or lack of control over output. He said he had made an editorial
decision not to cover the event.
He added: ''We have a finite amount of money to spend and other
priorities on which to spend it.''
Mr Cameron said BBC Scotland's main cultural coverage over the coming
months was nine 40-minute Edinburgh Nights programmes during the
Edinburgh International Festival.
A BBC spokesman in London said coverage of the proms was to be
increased because it was the 100th year of the event.
He added: ''It is nonsense to say there is a bias towards London and I
would dismiss it immediately. Our commitment to covering music from
throughout the UK is extensive.''
Mr Hawes dismissed the idea that coverage of the proms in London was
more important. He said: ''What they are saying is that the proms take
precedence over everything else.''
The piano finals are at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on September
17.

METAL Bulletin chairman Trevor Tarring has a #15m war chest and is
itching to use it to make acquisitions.
But he is adamant that it must be a global business and something he
understands, unlike the UK television and cable services sectors which
are overcrowded and offer little scope for international expansion.
He added that the target audience must have money to spend, which is
sometimes forgotten.
He is speaking from a position of strength with half-time profits up
21% to #1.46m and with market expectations raised yesterday for a full
figure up from #3.25m to about #3.75m.
About 75% of the #9m turnover is based in local currencies and so
there has been a useful currency gain on subscriptions from the
magazines covering anything from metals, derivatives to wool as well as
from conference business.
The only dull area has been the financial sector due to general lack
of confidence.
After their recent good run, the shares eased 1p to 607p. The interim
dividend has been raised 20% to 4.8p.

STEPHEN McGINTY speaks to an Edinburgh Festival performer who
continues to practise the art which nearly caused her death four years
ago
TONIGHT Australian trapeze artist Anni Davey will perform in Edinburgh
and remember that a little bit of the Meadows belongs to her. It's a
divot, a dent produced by her head. ''I'm going to look for it,'' she
laughs now. Four years ago she could only cry.
At a pre-festival press conference in 1991 Davey was working with
Circus Oz when a trapeze act accident almost ended her career, and her
life. It was during the Chinese pole routine, when she was suspended
upside down by a footstrap, holding her partner in her arms.
The foot strap snapped. Her partner fell on her feet, but Davey  hit
the ground hard. She broke both her wrists and neck in two places. A
photographer shouted for no-one to move, no one to touch her. ''I heard
it break. I knew my neck was broken. I looked down at my wrists and they
were like swans' necks.''
While waiting for the ambulance to arrive from the nearby Royal
Infirmary she regained feeling in her legs. Once strapped to a stretcher
she was whisked away and doctors deliberated for three days on whether
or not to operate. The fall had smashed one of her vertebral arteries.
Surgery could damage the other, and so the operation was deemed too
dangerous.
For a month she was shunted between the Royal Infirmary and the
Western General where she received osteopathic treatment for her arms.
Despite obvious distress she remained quite calm. ''I don't know why I
wasn't panicking. After a while it was because I was completely smacked
out on morphine. That lasted a month, just lying in hospital getting a
wee jag every couple of hours.''
Davey, 31, is, in fact, convinced that it was her trapeze training
that saved her life. For 18 months prior to the accident she had been
rehearsing head-to-heads, where her partner performed a head-stand
balanced on Davey. ''My neck was so strong -- usually if you land the
way I did you don't live.''
In Edinburgh Davey  was placed in a halo-harness to allow the bones to
heal. A plastic corset was attached to her body to hold rods which were
fitted to her head in the form of a crown. ''It's so barbaric, the
treatment. They get an electric drill and they drill a couple of holes
in your head.
''For maintenance they get a screw driver out the back of the car,
tighten the bolts. It was so f***ing sore. The doctor said he had never
heard anyone swear so much in his life.''
After a month she was allowed to fly home with Circus Oz. But in Perth
an X-ray revealed that her bones were not healing properly. For seven
weeks she was forced to lie in a hospital bed, trapped in a halo-frame
to which weights were attached to stretch her neck.
''I handled it because I knew I was going to walk again. I could move.
I could wash myself. I was the luckiest person there. I was in the bed
next to a 17-year-old who had crashed roller-blading. She couldn't move
at all. So I just felt incredibly lucky.''
It was only after five and half months of traction, and a further two
years of physiotherapy, that Davey  was able to return to the trapeze.
''I'm one of these people who will have an accident like that and go
over it every night in my mind, just so I remember every move. I refused
to believe that I would never do it again.''
Despite serious damage to the deltoid muscle in her right arm Davey
did return. In 1993, working with three other trapese artists in a group
called Club Swing, she developed her own pleasure palace to replace the
months of pain. Their controversial new show Appetite mixes sex, food
and symbolism.
''Every night I have to remind myself of the accident. I have to
instil fear in myself. If I fall again -- I'm dead.''
Appetite is at 11 pm in The Palladium, Broughton Street, until
September 2.

THE financial team which helped pave the way back to Paradise for
Celtic Football Club has been signed to perform a similar task for
Preston North End, one of England's oldest football clubs.
Glasgow stockbrokers Greig Middleton &amp; Company, which advised Celtic
on the #14.4m share issue which facilitated the redevelopment of Celtic
Park, will advise the Lancashire club and act as nominated broker during
its proposed #4m flotation in September.
Preston North End will use the share issue to finance reconstruction
work on its ground, Deepdale, and to strengthen its pool of players. The
club also plans to construct a national UK football museum, to be
completed before the 1996 European championships, which England will
play host.
Mr Bryan Gray, chief executive of Baxi Partnership, which owns Preston
North End Holdings, said he believed the successful involvement of Greig
Middleton in the Celtic flotation would ensure the smooth running of the
Preston issue.
He added: ''As not many football clubs have been floated, we were
looking for an experienced team which we knew we could work with.
''Football clubs have sometimes appeared as risky propositions to
investors and, as Greig Middleton are a well-known and reputable firm,
we believe their association with this issue will enhance the
credibility of our flotation.''
Mr Gray said he had been impressed by the company following Baxi
Partnership's June takeover of Barrhead Sanitaryware in Hillington,
Glasgow, for whom Greig Middleton were stockbrokers.
He confirmed that PNE Holdings had requested that the same
professionals, Mr Drysdale Graham, of McGrigor Donald, Mr Charles
Barnet, of Parnell Kerr Foster, and Mr John Rafferty, of W &amp; J Burness,
would be involved in its flotation.
Mr Hugh Nash, a director of Greig Middleton, said: ''Preston North End
and Celtic are very similar cases in that they are both clubs who
approached us under good management and stewardship.
''Preston's average gate of 9500, though smaller than Celtic's,
indicates sizeable dormant community resource necessary for share issues
of this type.
''Football clubs seeking investment are now increasingly turning from
corporate sponsorship to the supporting public and we believe this is
the way forward.
''If the support traditionally provide 80% to 90% of the club's income
through its gates, why shouldn't these people be the financial
beneficiaries of club success by being shareholders?''
Celtic raised #14.4m from a public share issue in February, which
attracted more than 10,000 investors.

'CITIZEN DAVE' Church, the leader of the Labour administration in
Walsall, is not known to me personally but I have encountered many of
his type in local government. There was a time on Edinburgh District
Council when one was permitted to drink only politically-correct
Nicaraguan coffee and Murdoch newspapers were banned from the
councillors' reading room.
Come to think of it -- they still are. In view of Tony's trip Down
Under to worship at the feet of the great man himself, is it not time
for another policy to be ditched, Comrades?
Dave, of course, is God's gift to Dr Brian Mawhinney -- Tory chairman
in succession to Jeremy Hanley who made so many slips one sometimes
wondered if he was sponsored by Fyffes bananas -- currently scouring the
country in search of the loony left. Former fork-lift truck driver Dave,
with a penchant for concrete hippopotamus statues and musical fountains,
is just what the Doctor ordered, accused of intimidating anyone who
stands in his line of fire and for providing ''jobs for the boys''. Now
where have we heard such allegations before? In fact, Dr Mawhinney will
have no difficulty in identifying targets for the Tories. Police are at
present investigating allegations against councils in North Tyneside,
Bradford, Thameside, Lambeth, and Paisley -- all Labour-controlled areas
-- while the Monklands saga drags on.
Little wonder that ''new'' Labour under Mr Blair is becoming
increasing irritated by the old socialists occupying many of the town
halls. Tony and Dave are about as likely a partnership as Laurel and
Costello.
I do not believe for a moment that the majority of Labour councillors
are in any way corrupt. But the arcane rules which govern much of what
happens in that party often allow cliques of determined idealogues to
take control of branches and districts. Just watch the fur fly in the
Glasgow parliamentary contests for example; listen to the tales of how
members have been recruited.
Citizen Dave's alleged antipathy to officials who do not share his
political sympathies is hardly a feeling confined to the Walsall area.
There are very few members of the Conservative, Scottish National or
Liberal Democrat parties working in local government who ever stand for
public election; to do so would not be to advance their professional
ambitions.
Labour councillors do it all the time.
It is therefore particularly important to ensure that in appointing
officials -- the most important task undertaken by any local authority
-- everything should be seen to be above suspicion. That has not been so
in Scottish councils of late and the Staff Commission has voiced its
concern.
The appointment of a candidate on the threshold of retirement --
wonderful for the pension -- and the suggestion that relatives have been
involved in choosing members of their families do not breed much
confidence in the present system.
I therefore welcome the suggestion by the Scottish local government
Ombudsman, Mr Derrick Marks, that he might become involved in the
supervision of staff appointments and over commercial deals and
contracts entered into by councils.
Pull up a chair Mr Marks.
It may surprise you to know, for instance, that in my own new
authority we are not permitted to ask the age of any candidate who
applies. My colleague, Councillor James Gilchrist, inquired cheekily if
he might then be told how many years one chap had to go before he
received his pension. The fact that most people would be able to guess
within a few years of the actual age is ignored. You shall not be
entitled to know.
Nor are we allowed to inquire if the candidate is married or single. I
am not quite sure who this is meant to protect. Is it not relevant to be
aware that, for instance, a director of social work has had five wives
or husbands? Soon, I suspect, we shall be denied knowledge of which
gender they are.
The references provided by the candidates are not opened until after
the interviews have taken place. Why? Should we not know what others
have said of them? Then there is a wonderful catch-all question which
asks if there is anything in the candidate's background which could
prove embarrassing. This is akin to the old one which used to be on the
US entry form: ''Have you any intention of engaging in criminal
activities or attempting to assassinate the President of the United
States?'' Spike Milligan filled that in as ''only purpose of visit''.
Are any of our would-be high-flyers going to admit: ''Had six-month
affair with Brenda in property services''? I do not believe any of these
daft practices are prevalent in the business world. But then ''Citizen
Dave'' and his ilk rarely spend too much time there.
You will find, almost to a boy and girl, that their entire income
comes from the public purse. Mr Church once claimed he was on 45
committees, which does not leave a lot of time for a day job.
To cut down on councillors' commitments I would suggest that elected
members restrict themselves to appointing only the chief executive and
service directors. Leave the top officials to select the people they
would like as back-up.
That single step would eliminate hundreds of officials from any
suggestion that their jobs were awarded in return for political loyalty.
It would also save thousands of pounds in councillors' time.
Will it be adopted; do I hear a cheer from Mr Marks; is my letter of
thanks from Mr Blair in the post? As my old friend the Duke of Edinburgh
might well have quipped: ''Let's have a dram while we wait!''

Frankfurt, Wednesday -- The Bundesbank trimmed its main money market
interest rate today after nine weeks on hold, allowing the key
repurchase or ''repo'' rate to drop to 4.45% from 4.50%.
Market analysts said the central bank's move, which was at the top end
of their forecasts, decreased the chances of a discount rate cut this
week but would help some other European countries to let their leading
rates ease.
''This was at the top end of market expectations. It was really the
best that could be expected,'' said Michael Pratten at investment house
PaineWebber in London.
Belgium, where monetary policy is very closely tied to that in
Germany, Europe's powerhouse economy, immediately cut two of its
overnight lending rates by five basis points -- 0.05 percentage point --
each.
Analysts said the Bank of France would also face an easier task in
reducing its high rates.
''It makes the work of the Bank of France easier,'' said Dominique
Barbet of the Paribas banking group.
But analysts believed that it would be some weeks -- at best -- before
the Bundesbank would signal the go-ahead for rate cuts in many parts of
Continental Europe by reducing its 4% discount rate, the floor for
German short-term rates.
''The repo today suggests that the Bundesbank wants to keep the door
open for a possible future easing,'' Mr Pratten at PaineWebber said.
''But I think they will hold off for now.''
The German central bank last made a significant cut in its repo rate
in March, reducing it by 35 basis points.
Some analysts believed that the Bundesbank might even end this rate
cut cycle by shaving a few more points off the repo, leaving the
discount rate unchanged until rates start to move higher. -- Reuter

MUCH has been said and written about the changing role of women in
society but I am not sure that all of the changes have been necessarily
for the good. Undoubtedly there have been some improvements in the
overall lot of women but in many areas power still rests decisively with
men.
Social Focus on Women, the comprehensive survey of what it's like to
be a woman in the UK today, published yesterday by the Central
Statistical Office, makes fascinating if not wholly unexpected reading.
More women drive, and are becoming increasingly financially
independent. The proportion of British women who have a mortgage in
their own name only more than doubled between 1983 and 1994, to 17%.
Women today are far more likely than their mothers' generation to hold
some form of educational qualification -- and as we have seen from other
surveys, these qualifications are often better than those attained by
their male contemporaries.
Improved education is allowing more women to take jobs. The proportion
of women who were economically active rose from 44% in 1971 to 53% in
1994 and indications are that this is set to continue rising to 57% by
the year 2006. The sharpest increase in the economic activity rate
between 1971 and 1994 occurred among women aged 25 to 34, although
whether a women is economically active or not depends to some extent on
the number and ages of her children. Women whose youngest child is under
five are the most likely to be economically inactive. However, on the
downside, women in both manual and non-manual occupations continue to be
paid less than men.
The case for all-women parliamentary candidate lists is supported by
the survey findings that women are still under-represented in the ranks
of power, policy and decision making, despite the advances which have
been made in recent years. In the 1992 General Election fewer than one
in 10 MPs elected were women, although this was a great improvement on
10 years earlier. The situation is similar in local government: in 1993
only one-quarter of councillors were women, although this too has been
increasing. The proportion of public appointments held by women has also
risen, from 19% in 1986 to 28% in 1993.
However, it appears some things will never change. The bulk of
housework continues to be carried out by women, while men tend to be
responsible for repairs to household equipment. I know from personal
experience that it often pays not to let menfolk do many of the
household tasks if you actually want to get the job done properly.
Better still, employ another woman to do the work, thereby increasing
female employment levels and providing some often much needed income.
One fact of life which has had a profound impact on many women's lives
and on society as a whole is the increase in the level of divorce. In
1993/94, 14% of women in the 35 to 44 age group were either divorced or
separated. Between 1971 and 1993/94, the proportion of families in the
UK with dependent children who were headed by a lone mother nearly
trebled from 7% to 20%.
Children, particularly boys, need a male role model in the home,
preferably the father. Try as they might, many young women find it hard
to instil discipline in their sons. Given that statistics show young men
are responsible for much of society's anti-social behaviour, as much as
possible needs to be done at the earliest possible stage to try to
instil a sense of right and wrong.
Many single mothers are bringing up their children in poverty, leading
to subsequent health and educational disadvantages. The survey shows
that if separation occurs, women are more likely than men to see their
income fall: nearly half of women saw their household income drop
compared with under one-fifth of men. This is surely evidence of the
legitimacy, despite the high-profile knocking campaign, of the aims of
the Child Support Agency in making fathers provide a continuing
contribution to the costs of their children's upbringing.
Women are certainly not afforded equal status to men in society but I
am not sure that is necessarily a bad thing. There seems little
attraction in women aping the mistakes of men.
Career women often have to deny their femininity to progress in
male-dominated industries. Surely it would be far better for different
roles to be recognised and valued equally in society, whether inside the
home or in the workplace. Admittedly this is a tall order but
increasingly women are finding it is often physically impossible to
combine satisfactorily the roles of mother, wife, housekeeper, cook, and
also have a job outside the home.

THE Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of
England were again at odds over interest rates on July 5, minutes of the
meeting, published yesterday, showed.
But there were signs that Eddie George did not press his case for a
rise in rates with the same force as he has on previous occasions.
The Governor accepted that the economy was slowing down and his call
for monetary tightening ''before very long'' contrasted with earlier
warnings that dearer money was needed ''sooner rather than later''.
''Taken overall, the real economy might be a little softer than would
have been supposed two or three months ago. But it was too soon to be
sure if this softer tone would persist. If it did, then that would
clearly ease concerns about inflation further ahead,'' the minutes
reported Mr George as saying.
But he concluded that, even if the exchange rate recovered from its
recent weakness, the Bank's judgment remained that some further
tightening of policy would be needed before very long to be reasonably
confident of getting underlying inflation back below 2.5% in 1997.
Both men agreed that the judgment was very finely balanced, but
Kenneth Clarke argued that the balance of the data over the previous
month had reinforced his view that interest rates should not be changed.
Evidence on activity had tended to confirm the Chancellor's view that
growth had slowed to a more sustainable rate.
Mr Clarke and Mr George, who have been at loggerheads since May, met
again on July 27 when it is assumed they again agreed to differ. Last
week, the quarterly inflation report repeated the Bank's warning that
the Government would miss its inflation target unless rates were raised.
However, the Chancellor appears to be winning the argument, at least
for the time being. The slowdown in activity has wrong-footed the
Governor.
Sterling too has been stronger over the last week following the boost
given to the dollar by Japan's decision to encourage its financial
institutions to invest abroad.
By last night, its trade weighted index stood at 84.5, compared with
83.5 ahead of the July 5 monetary meeting. The recovery, however, is
small in relation to the fall from 88.5 so far this year.
Base rates have stood at 6.75% since February and are likely to remain
at this level until the final quarter of the year. Signs of an upturn in
activity, indicating that the slowdown had been no more than a pause for
breath, would be the most likely trigger for Mr Clarke to abandon his
resistance to higher rates.
It is understood that unpublished Bank of England projections show
underlying inflation falling below 2.5% in the second half of 1997. The
Government's target is to achieve 2.5% by the end of the current
Parliament -- in the spring of that year if it runs its full course.

BOOMING exports, rising productivity, and benefits from past
investment helped push Glynwed's half-year profits ahead by 42.6% to
#41.5m.
The most exciting market is Germany which accounts for more than #20m
of sales. Here Glywnwed is benefiting from the success of its stainless
steel kitchen sinks, which have captured 20% of the market, and strong
demand for steel and plastic products.
Overall selling prices rose 12.9%. This figure reflected a switch to
higher value products, making the 9.2% growth in overall volumes a more
reliable indicator of progress. That was achieved on a mere 0.7% rise in
employee numbers who, on an annualised basis, increased their turnover
from #90,100 to #108,300 and profit per head from #25,600 to #29,500.
There were two dull spots. Inevitably UK housing, which accounts for
about 6% of overall turnover, which rose 24.4% to #609m, made its leaden
impact felt. That removed the best of the cookers and stoves profits
potential but it impacted more seriously on the copper tube activities.
These managed to cut losses and Wednesbury Tube is expected to reach
breakeven by the year-end. Realistically though this is perhaps best not
considered as a long-term core activity.
The #147m acquisition of the Victaulic pipes business is proceeding
smoothly with Glynwed chairman Gareth Davies hoping that the Office of
Fair Trading will give its approval in just over a fortnight.
Full-year profits would disappoint at under #88m (#67m) despite the
understandable caution about the second half and the continuing
uncertainty in the UK economy. This level would leave the shares at 361p
trading at 13-times likely earnings. Helped by a 6% rise in the interim
dividend to 4.4p, Glynwed looks as if it can ride future UK recessions
more easily than hitherto and is worth tucking away.

ABERDEEN Football Club will ask shareholders to approve a #3.5m share
issue and a change in its status from a private to a public company at
its annual general meeting on Tuesday.
In light of reports that some shareholders have recently been offered
#30 per share for their holdings, there is a feeling that Aberdeen may
have pitched the issue price too low. The offer price implies a value
for existing shares of #17.50.
However, in a letter to shareholders, chairman Mr Ian Donald said the
board had carefully considered the price at which the new shares should
be offered and had taken professional advice.
Director Mr Gordon Buchan said the club had no knowledge of
transactions at prices in excess of #17.50 per share, although he
acknowledged it would not be aware of private deals between individuals.
He added that there had been very few transfers of shares over a long
number of years and pointed out that the new shares were being issued at
a slight premium to net assets.
Aberdeen initially plans to increase the number of shares in issue
from 100,000 to one million through a nine-for-one bonus issue. This
will give existing shareholders 10 times as many shares, each worth
one-tenth of their current value.
It will then offer two million new shares for sale at #1.75 each.
Assuming the issue is fully subscribed, it will raise #3.5m before
expenses.
Priority will be given to existing shareholders who wish to avoid
dilution of their current holdings and dividends.
Aberdeen's poor league performances last season and its early exits
from the Scottish and UEFA Cup competitions affected the club's profit
and loss account for the year to end-April.
However, Aberdeen's pre-tax loss of #652,227 would have been #495,425
greater at #1.15m but for a change in accounting policy, which means
transfer fees are now written-off over the period of a new signing's
initial contract. Previously, the entire fee was charged to the profit
and loss account in the year it was paid.
Mr Buchan said that, with the cost of players having increased
significantly, more and more clubs were following what Aberdeen was now
doing with transfer fees. He added that the Old Firm adopted a
''similar'' policy.
Aberdeen hopes to increase its number of shareholders from about 170
to the thousands through the issue.
With the ''Rule 4.2'' share-trading facility currently used by Rangers
and Celtic due to end next month, the Stock Exchange's new Alternative
Investment Market is one of the options being considered by Aberdeen.
Celtic has already declared its intention to sign up for AIM with
Rangers adopting a wait-and-see attitude.
Aberdeen is not raising the money to clear its bank debt of #2.3m,
which is partly a result of its #2.6m portion of the #4.5m cost of the
new Beach End stand.
Mr Buchan said the cash raised would be used for the player pool and
the general development of the club and its facilities. It was hoped a
significant amount could be used to strengthen the player pool.

AS the proud owners of the biggest nuclear arsenal in Western Europe
we should, of course, be boycotting ourselves, not the French. Perhaps
we could refuse to speak to one another, or insist that civilised
countries everywhere cease forthwith to trade with us. Deeds, not words.
It is not clear, in any case, quite how a surgical strike by Asda
customers on the vineyards of Macon would dissuade M Chirac from his
nuclear experiments. The French wine trade has done its best for a
decade and more to cede market share to New World growers -- Australia
and New Zealand foremost among them -- by pushing prices through the
roof. Boycotts, not least those which look suspiciously like publicity
stunts by the hotel trade, are unlikely to have a deterrent effect.
Nor, for that matter, is international opprobrium. French statesmen
from de Gaulle onwards have exhibited a mulish streak as wide as the
Channel when national pride is at stake; they seem almost to enjoy
defying the world. France is never more self-regarding than when it
imagines it is standing alone, and never more thrawn than when defending
its nuclear deterrent.
It has something to do, perhaps, with national psychology.
Perversely, given its sufferings in two world wars and its
humiliations in Indochina, France has been slow to accept a diminished
role in international affairs. English may be the global language but
the francophonie, that disparate group of French-speaking imperial
survivors, is still extolled, and with it France's often absurd sense --
of which Chirac is the impetuous embodiment -- of its own importance.
Hence the Canadian government's reluctance to criticise the Pacific
tests for fear of upsetting Quebec. Hence, too, the willingness of
French governments of every stripe to become embroiled in unsavoury
overseas adventures -- Rwanda, where French troops in UN berets stepped
in to protect the killers, being a good, nasty example.
Equally, France's environmental movement has been a late developer and
its anti-nuclear lobby almost non-existent. Neither left nor right,
compensating for the ignominy of 1940 and determined to do without
America, has questioned seriously the need for an independent deterrent.
Meanwhile, the huge civil nuclear programme has attracted some protests,
but memories of the oil shocks of the 1970s and the absence of anything
resembling Britain's North Sea reserves have kept them muted.
Thus, if you had to draw up an agenda for the French media over the
past few weeks it would read as follows: Bosnia, first, foremost, and
everywhere, with much credit given to Chirac for his boldness, whatever
his real motives. Secondly, the bombing of the RER station at
Saint-Michel, a horrific reminder, so it seems, that France's
willingness to interfere in Algeria has ramifications at home. Thirdly,
and some way distant, les essais nucliaires.
Le Monde, at least, has told Chirac he is mistaken, but largely
because of international reactions to the decision to resume testing
rather than because of any moral argument. In the regional press, with
its many political divisions, responses have been mixed. Le Journal de
la Haute Marne, for example, warns the government not to allow ''un
complexe d'infirioriti'' to dictate policy, but others were this week
pointing out that Australia and New Zealand have never suffered ''une
invasion de leur territoire, la destruction systimatique de chaque
ville, de chaque commune''.
The French mainland has equally never suffered the effects of an
atomic bomb, of course, but for those opposing the tests (elements of
the left, predictably enough) there has been, as yet, no overwhelming
surge in public support. Foreign reactions, led by the Scandinavians,
have counted for more than opinion at home.
Besides, it is the holiday season. Politically speaking, France is
asleep. Protests from Britain, home of Trident, are regarded as the
usual hypocrisy; protests from America are treated with disdain.
''L'acteur amiricain Martin Sheen'' might attract attention for calling
on Chirac, at a Hiroshima commemoration ceremony, to reverse his
decision ''au nom et en l'honneur de Jacques Cousteau'' but it isn't a
story for which front pages are held. Nor is New Zealand's doomed scheme
to drag France to the World Court.
After all, French politicians know, as do their British and American
counterparts, that the test ban proposed to begin next year is a joke.
The exemption for ''small'' tests amounting to 100 to 200 tons of TNT
being sought by the Pentagon clears the way for the next generation of
nuclear devices -- precision nukes, if you like, in contrast to the
Armageddon missiles of nightmare, the sort of weapons which would once
again make nuclear war ''thinkable''. Hence Britain and America's
refusal to criticise the French.
There is, nevertheless, one argument that carries weight in France.
If she reserves the right to possess nuclear weapons, why should
other, less stable, countries not demand the same? In Spain, Italy, and
France the possibility of some future nuclear attack from North Africa
is no fantasy.
Algeria was only just restrained from embarking on a nuclear programme
and no-one regards Libya's Gaddafi as predictable. What sort of example
is France setting; what sort of argument can she put up? A bad example,
needless to say, and a poor argument, but that doesn't mean there is
much chance of Chirac changing his mind. Blanket consumer boycotts will
thus count for little; political and moral pressure -- the right kind of
boycott -- might yet work.
The real moral example, of course, would be for Britain to give up its
own atomic squibs. But how many of our political parties, left or right,
would agree?

NINETY-three jobs at Kvaerner Govan are to go in an effort to improve
productivity and profitability.
The Clyde shipyard, which has been struggling with a lean order book
and was criticised by its Norwegian owners earlier this year, said
reorganisation of its steel work departments was the reason for the job
losses.
The redundancies, which management hope will be voluntary, are
expected to be implemented in the next month. They will reduce the
workforce at the yard to about 1300.
Union officials, led by shop stewards convener Davie Cooper, said they
were co-operating with management. They recognised that market
conditions meant such changes were necessary, and expected the required
number of volunteers to be forthcoming.
The decision affects 70 in Kvaerner's steel work departments and 23
other jobs in services and supervision.
The steel manufacturing process is one of the key functions in
shipbuilding. Worldwide competition in this sector is intense,
particularly in the Far East.
Mr Kjell Mikalsen, the managing director, said yesterday that the
company had, until now, been working with large chemical tankers which
required a lot of steel work. It was now building vessels which needed
less.
''It could be that we will need more staff, if orders for larger
vessels come in again, but we have to go by the order book as it looks
now.
''We have to balance the steel work departments with other departments
and we could not afford to keep on 100 people more than we need.''
The company is building, in conjunction with VSEL, an #80m helicopter
landing ship for the Royal Navy which is due to be launched in October
and delivered next June.
It has also just started the steel work on a #12.5m supply ship for
shipowners Harrison (Clyde) Ltd, due to be delivered next June or July,
and has won a contract to build a small #10m oil production carrier for
Pritchard-Gordon, which is due for delivery in the autumn of next year.
Kvaerner Govan's parent company, which is the biggest shipbuilding
group in Europe, singled out Govan for criticism in its quarterly
statement in May and said earnings and productivity there remained
unsatisfactory.
An internal drive to remedy the situation and to produce three vessels
a year was continuing but the yard was not yet performing as well as
divisions in Germany. This was despite a significant turnaround since
Kvaerner bought it in 1988, when it was making losses of #30m to #40m a
year.
The yard made a #400,000 profit last year, on a turnover of #100m, and
managers are optimistic about winning further contracts this year. An
increase in profits is expected when the next annual figures are
released.
Mr Mikalsen said: ''We have made many changes during our campaign to
improve productivity and I am 100% convinced that the future of Kvaerner
Govan is very safe.''
There were 2300 employees when the Norwegian company took over in
1988. That number should be down by 1000 by next month -- ''about the
right size,'' Mr Mikalsen said, ''so we have no intention to reduce the
workforce further.''

THE Second World War was an astounding example of a struggle between
opposing scientists and engineers but this point was not emphasised in
The Herald at the time of the VE-Day celebrations. It is appropriate at
VJ-Day, which marked the official ending of the war, to recall some of
the amazing achievements of British scientists -- in retrospect they
seem to me to have the right to claim they brought victory to the
Allies.
Anniversaries are not always the proper occasions on which to get
things historically correct because people's memories are stimulated in
recalling their own personal experiences. This lets me make my first
important point, which is that the British scientists who did so much to
win the Second World War have recorded almost nothing of their efforts
and indeed seem unwilling to use either radio or TV to tell of how much
was achieved.
Notable exceptions are Professor R V Jones in his splendid book Most
Secret War which is confined to scientific intelligence, and Sir Bernard
Lovell who has told part of the story of British radar. As one of the
few who took part in most of the great scientific ventures, I can try to
do what my fellow scientists have generally and signally failed to do.
As I was so personally involved, my story tends to be somewhat
autobiographical.
My wife was also at work with me in the Cavendish Laboratory in
Cambridge when it was made clear that we were expected to join the war
effort under way in various Government labs. The main thought was that
university ideas would boost the work under way in places like the Royal
Aircraft Establishment while maybe yielding entirely new concepts in the
weapons field.
In 1937 the Government commissioned the construction of the ''Chain'',
which was the brainchild of the Scot Sir Robert Watson-Watt, to put
around our coastline a radar shield which, from the start of the air
war, gave our overstretched and limited number of fighters the
overwhelming advantage of being in the right place when invading German
bombers arrived. So in 1939 and 1940 our fighter aircraft were able to
deal a massive blow to German bombing might, which till then was
all-conquering in Europe. The Battle of Britain was a turning point of
the whole war.
Other major inventions followed quickly, with university scientists
joining the staff of Government labs. Soon we had the piano wire, the
proximity fuse, IFF, the magnetron to generate centimetre waves with
applications in many devices, and finally the atom and hydrogen bombs.
All too often it is thought that the British did not contribute much in
the development of atom power. Nothing is further from the truth. At the
end of 1938 we realised in the Cavendish Lab that a nuclear reaction
might be possible. Aware of the massive power which might be unleashed,
a request went from our lab in Cambridge to Professor Joliot in Paris
asking him to keep secret what we guessed he might also have discovered
in his own lab.
In January 1939 I had measured fission, the first such observation
ever made, and at the same time we heard that Joliot in Paris was trying
to discover the key to the fission process -- in effect the number of
neutrons released from each uranium atom split, which was soon found to
be sufficient for a self-maintaining device of explosion. Joliot was
again asked not to publish his important result but he put in print some
of his work while we in Britain kept all our highly sensitive knowledge
secret.
Cockcroft, the leading Cavendish scientist of the time, believed
plutonium was better in principle than uranium in a bomb. He said
nuclear reactors could be used to generate plutonium and he spent a good
part of the war at Chalk River in Canada helping to get a reactor going.
British scientists were entirely capable of building a British atomic
weapon and, as shown later, it would have been a more versatile device
with plutonium acting as the main power source driving the longer-term
hydrogen fusion devices.
In the event, overstretched resources dictated that a number of us
ended up playing a valuable part in the US effort, with British experts,
including my wife and myself, working for the final years on the US
bomb.
I recall an occasion illustrative of British genius. In early 1945,
before the first device was tested, a few British in their Berkeley
office began to discuss the potential for even more powerful hydrogen
fusion weaponry. It was roughly five years before the first ever
hydrogen device was eventually exploded by the Russians.
The atom bombs finally dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki only killed a
fraction of the millions whose lives were ended by conventional weapons
during the Second World War. However, the awesome power unleashed by a
single device almost immediately convinced the Japanese to capitulate.
On a personal note, I have been heartened to learn from ex-Japanese
prisoners of war that without these bombs they would certainly
themselves have died within weeks under the cruel conditions of
captivity.
I mentioned a list of inventions, with a coastal radar as the first,
but there was a constant flow of innovation during the war years. To
counter the menace of low-flying bombers the simple expedient of
throwing in the air about one thousand feet of piano wire by using a
Coastguard rocket served well to keep bombers from attacking our coastal
vessels.
We also put a new proximity fuse in the nose of all our defence
rockets, and even in shells when we had enough of the required small
radio tubes available. In the later attack on Britain with Hitler's
terror weapons, the V1 and V2, we found we could bring down around 95%
of the rockets by using proximity detonation.
It was the rapid and effective use of the marvellous magnetron,
generating great power at centimetre wavelength, that was deployed in
night fighting, in submarine hunting, and in blind bombing, with
hundreds of our bombers penetrating to targets all over Germany at
night, that finally drove the enemy to realise they were doomed.
I take the view that German submarines nearly won the desperate
struggle for supremacy in the Atlantic, but the fact that magnetron
waves could be directed downwards and resolve objects at water level
meant that, soon after, the subs were fleeing from the high seas and
seeking any port that offered shelter.
Let me finish by stressing that the cheapest and most effective means
of defending ourselves is to continue to have able scientists willing to
exert their gifts of inventiveness in defence matters. Simple things may
sometimes suffice. During the war my wife developed ''Window'' and
proved that very thin strips of tin foil in the sky made radar almost
useless -- a fact successfully exploited during D-Day when the German
radar was fooled into thinking the invasion was under way many miles
further along the French coastline. It was a simple concept but an
absolute success and one which is still employed as ''chaff'', for
example during the Falklands and Gulf wars.
Since David first successfully employed the technology of the sling
against the might of Goliath, it has been shown time and again that
inventiveness and technical skills provide an overwhelming strategic
advantage. The democratic powers have maintained their lead since the
end of the Second World War and Britain must maintain its vigilance and
continue to encourage and develop its unique creative talents to defend
its hard-won and dearly-bought freedoms.

ST GILES' Cathedral in Edinburgh is no stranger to a little local
difficulty with stools. Older readers may remember the Diary's coverage
of the Jenny Geddes protest in 1673 when she flung her folding stool at
the head of the reader of the liturgy. Times have moved on but trouble
with chairs persists.
This week the problem is with the Edinburgh Jazz Festival. The present
St Giles' meenister, the Rev Gilleasbuig Macmillan, has allowed the
ancient premises to play host to jazzfest gospel and jazz performances.
They have, we are glad to report, being getting bums on pews --
including that of ex-American President Jimmy Carter who popped in a few
days ago for a Deep South serving of organ and gospel.
The second St Giles' concert takes place tomorrow and features the
Five Blind Boys of Alabama whose ''stirring, hugely evocative spirituals
and gospel tunes'', it says in the programme, ''will be entirely at home
in the heart of this great church''. The Rev Gilleasbuig, while happy to
make his kirk available to the gospel singers, has made an unusual
stipulation.
Festival organiser Mike Hart explains: ''Around 200 chairs in the east
knave have to be turned round through 180 degrees so that the audience
can see the performers.
''But Gilleasbuig will not have this. We have pleaded, indeed we have
grovelled, but we have so far only won by degrees -- 90 of them in fact.
That is all he will allow.
''The chairs may now be turned sideways, he says, which means that the
audience will not be able to look at the performers and will only have
one ear pointing in the right direction. We may have to grovel some
more.'' Or, we suggest, borrow Jenny's stool from the National Museum.
Just wild
about Bessie
A RELATIVELY painless way into the Edinburgh Jazz Festival, we
thought, would be to take in a talk with gramophone records by George
Melly. It was on the subject of legendary American blues and jazz singer
Bessie Smith.
The talk had the potential to be very interesting and, at worst, would
not be dissimilar to many an evening we have spent with colleague Allan
Laing, taking us through his definitive collection of the works of
Lonnie Donegan.
Melly told us how as a schoolboy his discovery of the raunchy music of
Bessie Smith changed his life, in particular his pursuit of scrubbers.
(Mr Melly's words, not ours.) He found the scrubbers particularly
plentiful in the West End Cafe in Edinburgh, he informed us.
To avoid a stampede to this venue, we should point out that the West
End Cafe was an old trad jazz hing-oot in the capital, but is no more.
Continuing his talk in erudite manner, Mr Melly asked us to compare
and contrast two recordings of the classic ''piss-up song'' Moonshine
Blues, one by Bessie Smith and the other by her precursor and mentor Ma
Rainey.
We formed the opinion that the Ma Rainey record was much cracklier and
even more inaudible. But that was not the answer. Ma Rainey, Melly told
us, was basically a folk singer while Bessie Smith was at the cusp of
folk and art.
Bessie's ribald life was very much reflected in her songs, such as Me
and My Gin and I'm Wild About That Thing. The first is about bevvy and
the second is about something which her poppa has which causes bells to
ring and buttons to be pushed. We didn't quite follow all of the latter
but presume it will become clear when Mr Melly comes back with his
Advanced Bessie Smith lecture.
* Swedish musician Bent Persson appears in the jazzfest programme as
Bent Person. Well, it is Edinburgh at festival time. The calumny is
compounded by the description: ''He stands tall and plays like an angel
in spite of his name.''
* Many of the Edinburgh jazzfest events take place at the Cotton Club
venue which is sponsored by Tia Maria. The dark coffee liqueur is handed
out free to concertgoers in such copious amounts as to avoid any
accusations of an Edinburgh-style ''You'll have had your Tia'' attitude.
Tia Maria, as most of you probably know, means Auntie Mary. The Diary
thought it might be appropriate if one of the artistes might do a jazz
version of that song about Auntie Mary having a canary up the leg of her
drawers.
Unfortunately, we couldn't remember the rest of the words apart from a
few fragments such as ''it widnae come doon for a hauf a croon'' and
''doon it darted when she farted''. Perhaps some musicologist, a
Scottish George Melly, can help us out.
Scourge of
the pipes
TO continue our musical theme today, we hear from Pipe Major Iain
MacDonald of Glasgow, recently returned from Bulgaria where he took part
in a bagpipe festival. He was presented with Bulgarian bagpipes which
came with a set of instructions, part of which read:
''Persons with evident unfitness -- lack of front teeth, lack of
fingers etc, must not accepted. This is a precondition for fine results.
Players must be in a generally good health condition. Candidates with
chronic disease of the heart, lights, blood pressure disturbance, and
other important organs are not appropriate.
''The choice of an instrument is very important for the beginner
bagpipe player and his further success. In practice there are many
examples for beginners acquired high mastery with a good instrument. The
opposite examples are also well known -- young musicians got negative
attitude towards a bad instrument.
''The correct hands and body play-setting are a base for the
improvement of performer's habits. The training practice shows that the
play-setting problems have to be considered just from the first step.
The young bagpiper may easily accustom wrong habits, which removal needs
much time.
''The more technical is the material that the student has passed, the
more difficult is to be eliminated defects in incorrect body-setting,
cheeks winding, high fingers lifting, neck warping or shoulders taking
up.''
We know exactly what they mean. The neck warping and shoulders taking
up can be an absolute Bulgar.

I SEE that training has started for the coming rugby season. Many
years ago I played for a fairly well-known FP team in the 2nd XV. I was
not very good. I was, however, good at one thing, tackling.
A year or so ago, after a long spell of uninterest, I started watching
the odd international match. In the interval much has changed: the
scoring is different and more frequent, trousers are shorter; so are the
tempers. However, one feature of play is still the same: the tackling is
pathetic.
From my vantage point, it is obvious that tackling is a skill. A skill
can be learned, a skill can be taught. I would go so far as to say that
a nine-stone weakling could be taught to bring down Jonah Lomu.
Not just any nine-stone weakling, but one with some other qualities,
including humility. Not that this claim is ever likely to be put to any
sort of test, knowing young men as I do; after all, I was one myself
once.

WHAT a pity that Anvar Khan is so intolerant of ''highbrow'' culture.
Certainly ''pop'' culture is the prevailing ''zeitgeist'', but should
the other kind therefore be banned?
I deplore highbrows if they are so to make a good impression, or if
they really believe they are superior. I equally deplore the populists
if they jeer or despise the highbrows. Both have the right to their own
opinions, surely.
As for the idea of fun belonging only to pop culture, has Anvar Khan
ever been to a performance of Mozart's Marriage of Figaro, heard Haydn's
Toy Symphony, or Respighi's The Birds?
However highbrow she might think them, she would have to admit that
they do have an element of fun.

IN her enthusiastic response to our 150th anniversary exhibition, The
continuing Tradition: 75 Years of Painting at Glasgow School of Art,
1920-1995, Clare Henry correctly states that the language of
accessibility and communication deployed by Glasgow painters has nothing
in common with crude popularism and warns that Glasgow's year of Visual
Arts 1996 is soon to be launched in London with ''none other than the
amateur English artist, Beryl Cook''.
This is, indeed, alarming news. That the ''funny'' paintings of Beryl
Cook could represent the visual arts in Glasgow is a quite ludicrous
notion and should be firmly opposed.
The quality of ideas, seriousness of purpose, and colossal ambitions
of Glasgow's artists should be allowed to speak for themselves on such
an occasion. If anyone doubts this, they should visit the exhibition at
the GSA where each one of the 50 artists whose work is now on show
represents the very special achievements of art in Glasgow.

I NOTE in the winter brochure for the RSNO that out of a total of 26
concerts the Music Director, Mr Walter Weller, is to appear only seven
times and the Principal Guest Conductor is to appear only five times.
Yet in his introduction to the brochure, the chief executive, Mr Paul
Hughes, has the audacity to inform us that both Maestro Weller and
Maestro Layurev will be very much in evidence next winter.
May I ask by what peculiar piece of musical arithmetic he arrived at
that conclusion?
At a time when arts organisations are seriously underfunded and are
striving to raise their profiles in order to attract, one assumes, a
more loyal and devoted following, I question just who is benefiting,
apart from the individuals themselves, from the somewhat transient
presence of these peripatetic conductors.

When I visited the local police station the officer completed a form

I WAS shocked to read that Mr George Foulkes, MP, seemed to feel that
an apology was required from the solicitors involved in the so-called
Ayrshire child-abuse case.
Perhaps the social workers in question could consider the feelings of
the parents of these children, and those of the children themselves, who
were totally unjustifiably held in care.
If any apology is due, surely it is to those families who were torn
apart for years for no good reason.
I write as a close personal friend of the parents of one of the
families, with whom I would trust the lives of my own children.
I have watched their suffering over the years as they attempted to see
the justice that was finally done.

rights against the dangers of cyclists making use of pavements?
Certainly one would not wish to see any young children being driven

Have local authorities no powers to enforce rules to ensure the safety

WHITHER Nato? As an organisation linking the United States with Europe
in the name of common security it has been one of the most successful
institutions arising from the cold war. That it has a future in the
post-cold war age is undeniable because it is vital the United States
remains committed to Europe and does not relapse into isolationism. As a
transatlantic bridge Nato has served Britain and Europe well. The
special relationship may have been largely a myth fostered for their own
reasons by politicians here and in Washington, but America's commitment
to Nato has been a reality. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and
the revived independence of its former satellite states the political
map of Europe has, however, changed and Nato must change with it.
The communist empire dragged countries which historically and
geographically belonged to the West into its sphere of interest. Now
they want to be back where they belong and become part of Nato. The
Commons Defence Committee in its report yesterday was right to urge
caution about any increase in the membership of the 16-nation alliance
by admitting any of the former Warsaw Pact countries too soon. They see
membership as a guarantee of protection against any attempt by Russia to
reassert the influence the Soviet Union once had over them, but
membership carries obligations and to fulfill those the prime
requirement for any country is economic stability. There are good and
obvious political reasons for increasing Nato's membership, but it needs
no economic lame ducks, rather countries which can afford to take on the
obligations of membership by contributing men to its forces, money to
its upkeep.
A gradual enlargement of Nato over the next decade makes sense, and it
is the approach the Government has adopted. Poland, Hungary, Slovakia,
and the Czech Republic, at the front of the queue, are economically the
most successful of the former Warsaw Pact countries. But there are other
potential applicants whose claims cannot be ignored, like the Ukraine,
the country which divides Russia from the West. It would be fatal to
turn the Ukraine into some sort of buffer state because the temptation
would be for Russia to reassert its influence over the country with its
own security in mind. Russian concerns must also be understood, hence
the importance of the Partnership for Peace initiative. The progress to
enlargement must be sold to Moscow as not representing a threat. There
are two sides to any war. What to one side is self-protective action can
look like naked aggression to the other.
The membership queue is long. The Baltic states, Romania, and Bulgaria
must be considered. No dragging of feet, but cautious progress should be
the order of the day. The goals should be clear, and everyone must
understand what they are.

. . . in your ear, Michael. After writing to the people in Argyll, you
may have time to study the latest batch of Scottish economic statistics.
These are designed to tell us how Scotland's production and construction
industries have been doing. But the figures relate to the first quarter
of the year. You may have noticed that we are now in the third quarter.
You may also discover that the figures for the final quarter of last
year have been revised up by more than 2%. From your stint in UK
ministries you probably know that most economic statistics are revised
by a few decimal points as more information comes in. But how do you
expect to take decisions about Scotland's economy if the figures are six
months out of date when they are published and if the revisions are in
the same ball park as the annual rate of change in activity? Six months
out of date! That's quite quick for Scottish stats. Just under a year
ago your predecessor was given the gross domestic product figures for
1992. Presumably those for 1993 will soon cross your desk. GDP figures
paint a picture of the whole economy, including the services sector
which accounts for the bulk of it. The first estimate of UK GDP in the
second quarter of 1995 (this year) was published on July 21. So why
should you have to wait years for the same information about Scotland?
It may have been that in the years when the Scottish economy lagged
behind the rest of the UK year in year out, previous Secretaries of
State may have preferred not to have had confirmation of their worst
fears until it was too late to do anything about it. You are more
fortunate, however. The Scottish economy has been remarkably resilient
in the nineties, mainly because it escaped the worst ravages of the
recession. Unemployment has been falling faster in Scotland than in most
regions in England. Your problem is that you can never be sure about
current economic performance. Indeed if there was a Scottish boom at the
next General Election, you might not know about it until after you (and
a number of your parliamentary friends) had lost their seats. So unless
you want to pursue an alternative career as a professor of economic
history you should put a time bomb under your statisticians. Businessmen
too want accurate and up-to-date information about the Scottish economy
instead of having to rely on often contradictory survey evidence and
guesstimates by independent agencies.

<HEADLINE>Global warming set to increase in next 50 years, say scientists</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976961626</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE world is going to be a much warmer place in 50 years, according to
a new study by British scientists.
Global warming will continue to increase, at a rate which has been
predicted by a new model created by scientists at the Hadley Centre for
Climate Prediction and Research at the Meteorological Office in
Bracknell, Berkshire. They predict a future global mean warming of 0.3C
(0.54F) per decade for greenhouse gases alone.
The new study, published yesterday in the journal Nature, for the
first time takes into account sulphate aerosols in the atmosphere, which
tend to cool the earth by reflecting sunlight away. When these are
included in the equation, the rate of increase every 10 years is 0.2C
(0.36F).
Mr Tim Johns and his colleagues at the Hadley Centre found that even
when they included the effects of sulphate aerosols, computer models
pointed to a significant rise in temperatures across the world.
''By 2050, all land areas have warmed in our simulations, despite
strong radiative forcing in some areas,'' says the report.
''These models suggest that global warming could accelerate as
greenhouse gas forcing begins to dominate over sulphate aerosol forcing.
''As we move into the future, we can see that greenhouse gases will
increasingly dominate,'' he said.

First, setting a woeful rock-movie pattern, there was Elvis's tragic
and tawdry Hollywood odyssey. Sure, Jailhouse Rock was OK, but
thereafter we were left with a sad refrain: not Crying In The Chapel,
more Crying In The Cinema.
Moving on, the best you can say of Help! and Summer Holiday is that
they're candyfloss. Performance wasn't about rock music per se, but as
it starred Mick Jagger and was blank and paranoid, it came closer to it
than most movies.
Of course, there have been notable bits of cinema verite which have
managed to capture the period quaintnesses of the music business, from
Don't Look Back to Woodstock via Gimme Shelter. Yet it's fitting that a
comic rockumentary, Spinal Tap, has come closest to portraying the
ridiculous truth of life as it doth rock and thence roll.
Music simply changes too quickly to be accurately recorded by the
slow, lumbering movie-making process. Until now, that is, and the
Edinburgh Film Festival debut of the bleakly-hypnotic,
compellingly-Jarmanesque Hunger Artist, made in Glasgow on an ultra-low
starvation budget, suitably enough.
Director Bernard Rudden's 40-minute film has been hailed by informed
Glasgow clubbers as ''the first ever trance film''. Some of those
self-same clubbers were closely involved in the film's creation. Indeed,
the film's central character, a freak-show existentialist who starves
himself for the delectation of the masses, is played with skeletal
aplomb by a Glasgow DJ, the gnomically-named Flash, more usually a
record-spinning fixture at the Arches and its city-centre neighbour, the
Goldmine.
Flash's next move is a musical one, via the release on the local Limbo
label of Twentieth Century Hunger Artist, a condensed, danced-up 12-inch
version of the film's soundtrack. But who created the atmospheric
soundtrack to Hunger Artist?
Step forward, Paul Moore, of the Blue Nile, for whom Bernard
Rudden directed a much-acclaimed free-form road-diary, Flags And Fences,
based on the band's 1990 American tour. Moreover, there's a cameo
appearance in the film by Nilester vocalist Paul Buchanan as a dealer in
exotic animals.
Erstwhile-chanteuse Jerry Burns is in fact one of the few trained
actors in the film, which also features commendably understated
performances from a cost-effective cast including Bernard's DJ brother,
David, and one of the movie's producers, Mark O'Dowd, whose sleazy
authenticity in the role of The Profiteer is underpinned by his being
clad in Bernard's trademark pork-pie hat.
There was no cash for lavish costumery. The film went ahead on money
raised from assorted aunties, uncles and dentists, as well as from Jim
Hickey at Edinburgh's Boxcar Productions and Mark O'Dowd's Glasgow-based
Megalomania company.
But what of the film's soundtrack, an integral part of the film?
''It's comparable to the Blue Nile's music, but very different,'' admits
Bernard. ''The film deals in levels of psychology and atmosphere, so the
music is subtle layers. There are no live sounds. It's all samples and
street ambiences which were then modified and subjected to keyboard
manipulation.''
In this respect the music echoes the technical manner of the film's
creation. Hunger Artist is the first low-budget Scottish film to employ
digital editing technology in its genesis. ''It does away with rushes
and rolls of film,'' says Bernard.
''Everything comes up as icons on a monitor. If you think pictorially
and think fast, you can cut and paste, experiment and experiment. You
can do mixes, fades, overlays, and sound associations. It gives you a
palette that's quicker, if you like . . . where all the possibilities
are there right away, on tap.
''You can compare it to the speed with which little independent record
labels can respond to new influences and create things almost on a
weekly basis. Why not film now, too, instead of being three years
behind?'' he says.
Hitherto the Blue Nile's film-work had been confined to the
conventional composition of a spooky score for a BBC Scotland TV play,
Govan Ghost Story. ''I consciously worked with Bernard very closely at
Hunger Artist's editing stage,'' says Paul Moore.
''We sculpted away together, making things fit, creating one entity.
It wasn't a case of 'Here's the pictures, there's some music.' Bernard
had recorded a lot of soundtrack ambience, at a fairground, at Glasgow
Zoo. But the ambience wasn't being run directly with the pictures.
Instead, after sampling it, we added chords as they seemed to emerge.
''My favourite bit in the film is the fairground scene, where the
hunger artist remembers his childhood. Bernard shot the footage in
Glasgow in 1990, but the faces could have come from Eastern Europe at
the turn of the century.
''You see images playing back at different speeds, fading in and out
of one another. The music goes with the motion. It's very
impressionistic, but it works,'' he says.
Which is something which could be said of the music of the Blue Nile,
too. So where is it then, Paulie, the Nileys' long-overdue, long-awaited
third album?
Jings, it's been six years since Hats, which in itself appeared five
years after A Walk Across the Roof Tops. Paul brings good news. The next
Blue Nile album is almost completed. ''It's ready to be mixed. But it's
already too late to be released this year due to record company
scheduling -- would you believe that you have to submit an album by May
if it's to appear before Christmas?''
Meanwhile, if you can't get to see Hunger Artist during the Edinburgh
Filmfest (initially screening on Monday at the Filmhouse, repeated on
August 20), you'll be able to view it some time after Christmas on
Channel 4.
Up to minute; on the edge; in the mix. Hunger Artist is cool and tasty
mind-fodder.

AS a lifelong pacifist I have taken a great interest in the events to
mark the fiftieth anniversary of the dropping of the world's first
nuclear bomb on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Like so many, I am sorry that such action was taken. However, I fear
that with our usual British zeal for sympathising with the world's
victims before giving consideration to our own people we have once again
forgotten or overlooked one vital factor.
The British or Americans did not start the Second World War, the
Germans and the Japanese were in the first instance the aggressors.
As the daughter, niece, and niece-in-law of men who fought against or
were prisoners of war of the Japanese, I have felt ashamed of some of
those whom I believed were my fellow pacifists, ashamed for their lack
of compasison, ashamed for their ingratitude, and above all ashamed for
the insensitivity they have chosen to show to those men who suffered
and/or gave their young lives in the war against the Japanese. This was
a regime which history has shown to have been a brutal and cruel enemy
which showed or gave no compassion, no sympathy, and above all no
apology for its actions.
The Rev Kenyon Wright has a respected record as a man of peace but
when he and people like him cause offence and show disrespect to those
who by their sacrifice earned the peace we all hold so dear today I am
forced to ask the question:
Would the Japanese have planted trees, rung bells, and held
demonstrations in a wave of public sympathy for their previous enemies
the British and Americans, if Japan had won the war in Asia 50 years
ago?
Would the Japanese people show disrespect, 50 years on, to their own
victorious war veterans? I think not.

RUTH Wishart asks: ''How can it be legitimate to press the heirs of
the Japanese perpetrators of camp atrocities for a formal apology yet
remain sanguine about the unimaginable horrors of that week (Hiroshima
and Nagasaki) which wiped out entire civilian populations?'' (August 7.)
What Ruth Wishart seems unable to appreciate is that it is the
survivors of the Japanese atrocities still alive who are due an apology.
These men were not involved in the atomic bomb destruction of the
Japanese cities; it was not their concern.
In fact, many of them may feel that it was wrong to drop the bomb, but
despite that it still does not affect the obligation of the Japanese to
apologise to them (and in effect to those they destroyed) for the
protracted and deliberate treatment inflicted on them as helpless
victims.
The decision to drop the bomb was taken with the object of terminating
the war and ultimately saving human life (Japanese included). That
decision has now become debatable but whether it was right ot wrong the
case is strong in favour of it.
In contrast, the treatment of the Allied prisoners of war was barbaric
cruelty meted out with a sadistic disregard for the standards of
civilisation by a medieval race, which of course was completely
reprehensible.

NOW that the Mayor of Hiroshima is reported as having apologised for
the atrocities perpretrated by the Imperial Japanese Army during the
Second World War, can we expect the Emperor to have the guts to follow
suit? Or will he now play the coward like his bullies who enjoyed
beating and torturing us and now snivel that they were only carrying out
orders?
The buck stops at the top. It was all done in his father's name and he

I WISH to comment on an article by Stewart Lamont that appeared in The
Herald on July 15.
Mr Lamont laments on the fact that the paperback version of his book
never appeared because, to quote his own words, ''the publisher who had
signed it up took cold feet''.
In actuality it wasn't published because of the numerous and
documented falsehoods within the book.
The publisher's concerns were not simply that they would be sued --
this is a common threat that a publisher must face -- but that Lamont's
book had been so completely discredited that they would be sued and
lose.
It appears that Stewart Lamont has once again jumped on the bandwagon
of prejudice and hatred, and understandably so -- the Big Story
documentary contained as many falsehoods on Scientology as his book did.
It must be comforting when you are scraping the bottom of the barrel
to know that there are others also willing to stoop to such depths.

* Stewart Lamont writes: It is typical of the Scientology cult to try
to pretend that my book, Religion Inc (1985), was discredited when the
reverse is true, as reviews of the time bear out. The paperback edition
by another publisher was interdicted while they pursued a legal action.
Though they never did so, the book remained a casualty -- as the truth
so often does when dealing with this cult.

IT was with some dismay that I read of the proposed new conference
centre in Glasgow and viewed with a sense of embarrassment the
illustration of such a familiar and obvious structure (July 19).
Armadillo my arm; ''hulls of boats'' -- it's great and mighty ships
for which we are world-famous, not wee bit boats!
No, we are not fooled. This is simply a rip-off from the wonderful
Sydney Opera House and we should be ashamed to be party to such a
dreadful act of unoriginality.
As for the specification of materials to be utilised, what type of
inferior aluminium is being recommended that it has only a 40-year
lifespan?
I would expect more from a garden shed or from post-war prefabs which
are still inhabited happily.
I am certainly for Glasgow having the biggest, the best, and most
attractive, but in the name of all that is wonderful let us be original
and unique. Let us for example celebrate our heritage of engineering,
shipbuilding, trading, and invention on a world scale, which would
include a conference centre for 3000 plus and be totally original and
creative with it.
Does Glasgow really want this dead ''Armadillo''?

YOUR report, Machair stars in walk-out threat, raises some points
which deserve further clarification (August 9).
The Gaelic Television Fund was cut from #9.50m in 1993/94 to #8.738m
in 1994/95. In these circumstances Comataidh Telebhisein Gaidhlig found
it impossible to meet the full cost of shooting 26 episodes of Machair
on location in the Western Isles in the current financial year.
Instead CTG has concentrated on negotiating a deal with Scottish
Television Enterprises which would secure the long term future of
Machair, providing regular work for the cast from 1996 onwards.
This entails, inter alia, the erection of a building which will allow
the producers to shoot Machair in a controlled environment, making the
production more cost-effective while ensuring the future of the series
and giving the cast greater potential security of employment.
Clearly, such negotiations take time as they involve co-operation
among a range of agencies. Plans to secure the future of Machair for the
next three years are well advanced as co-operation has so far been
forthcoming.
We trust that all negotiations will come to a satisfactory conclusion
in the near future to allow the show to go on.

A DENTIST drugged and sexually molested four female patients including
an 11-year-old girl, the General Dental Council was told yesterday.
Mr Michael Evans, of Broad Street, Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, gave
Mrs A, Miss B, 11-year-old Miss C and Mrs D excess doses of drugs before
behaving indecently towards them at his surgery between April and July
last year, it was alleged.
Miss Linda Dobbs, barrister to the council, told its professional
conduct committee in London yesterday that Mr Evans made sure he was
alone with the patients before giving them intravenous injections of
sedatives and molesting them.
In a further allegation, the dentist is accused of administering
excess dosages of sedatives to a Miss E in July or August 1994.
A charge of indecent behaviour towards Miss E was dropped at the
beginning of the hearing.
Mr Evans, 28 and married, groped Miss C -- and later did the same
thing to her mother even though she knew of her daughter's ordeal and
wore a bodysuit ''for protection'', said Miss Dobbs.
He injected the schoolgirl with a sedative before putting his hands
inside her jumper and then her jeans, the committee was told.
When she got home she told her mother, Mrs D, what had happened and
asked: ''Why did he do that?''
The girl demonstrated Evans's actions.
''She was very groggy and kept repeating she was drunk. She was very
sexually naive at the time,'' said Miss Dobbs.
Mrs D, mindful of her daughter's claims, wore a bodysuit with a tight
neck when she went for a tooth extraction and fillings the next week.
After injecting her with a sedative, Mr Evans, it was alleged, put his
hand inside her jumper and felt her left breast before feeling around
her pants. He then kissed her on the mouth.
The dentist stopped when his practice nurse came in.
Miss Dobbs claimed Mr Evans also groped six months' pregnant Miss B
after injecting her with a sedative before capping one of her teeth.
The charges involving Mrs A and Miss B relate to his practice in High
Street, Banchory.
Mr Evans was said to have lived previously at Davidson Drive,
Inverurie.
Mrs A sobbed as she told the committee of being molested and left
feeling ''disgusted and dirty'' by Mr Evans, who denies serious
professional misconduct.
Mrs A angrily denied that she might have had an erotic dream while
under the influence of the injection.
''I was not dreaming. It happened,'' she insisted.
The case continues.

THERE is a disturbing undercurrent to the crisis now facing Scottish
Opera with its chorus having gone on strike on the eve of the company's
prestigious appearances at the Edinburgh Festival. The management
appeared shaken and incredulous following the chorus's rejection of what
the company seemed to feel was a good package of offers, including extra
holidays, extra money dependent on a more secure financial future, and
an improvement in conditions of employment. That was perhaps
understandable in the light of the opera company's predicament, where,
in the face of persistent underfunding, it has had to implement a
hardline programme, including the shelving of an opera, administrative
cutbacks, and a pay freeze across the company. However, the chorus's
evident anger and determination to reject the package, despite the
recommendation of its own union, must alert the management of Scotland's
biggest artistic organisation to the root cause. It's not just money,
not mere conditions of employment. It is credibility. The chorus -- and,
it is rumoured, its members are not alone in the company -- has little
faith in its management. Simply, it does not trust the management to
deliver the goods.
This was implied earlier in a working party report which specifically
highlighted problems between the management and the workforce in
Scottish Opera, and recommended that mechanisms be sought by which these
might be identified. The management was a signatory to this report. The
chorus, clearly, feels that the fundamental problem has not been
tackled; it is saying that, as Britain's lowest-paid opera chorus (which
it is), once again it has been promised jam tomorrow, and with strings
attached. It is encumbent on the management of Scottish Opera at least
to acknowledge this lack of faith by its employees, and attempt to
address it. It is time to compromise.

<HEADLINE>Fears north of the Border as privatised water company goes for major restrictions. Drought controls closer in Scotland.</HEADLINE>

SOME areas of Scotland could be placed under drought orders by the end
of the month if appeals to stop extravagant water use go unheeded, a
senior water services official said yesterday.
The warning came as water services throughout Scotland, faced with the
possibility of the hot, dry spell continuing, appealed to people to
exercise common sense over consumption in the coming weeks.
Their concern follows an application yesterday by the privatised
Yorkshire Water for a drought order to enforce water restrictions which
would include a ban on car washing and watering public parks.
In Scotland, where water supplies are still under local authority
management, the worst affected areas are reported to be in the Borders
and Fife.
Borders Regional Council expressed ''serious concern'' over shortages
at the village of Stow, where warning leaflets have been distributed to
residents urging a moderate use of water.
Borders plans to tank water from Galashiels to replenish the depleted
underwater reservoir serving Stow, which draws its supply from local
springs and not the region's main network.
Mr Peter Braid, deputy water services director, said consumers were
continuing to turn hosepipes on gardens and cars, leading to ''falling
water levels'' across the region.
He added that a hosepipe ban was not yet being contemplated but added:
''If the dry weather continues and people continue their current useage,
we would be thinking about restrictions within three or four weeks.
''Water is a precious commodity and at this stage we would ask whether
it is really necessary for people to use it simply to green their
lawns.''
Asked whether he could foresee drought orders in Scotland, he said:
''If this weather continues and people continue to water their lawns
then, by the end of August, I think we will.''
Fife Regional Council yesterday revealed its level of reservoir
storage had fallen by 50% and blamed gardeners for an increased draw on
the system of 10%, representing 2.6 million gallons a day.
The local authority said that before taking any mandatory action it
would issue ''a final warning shot'' to consumers. That situation, said
a council spokesman, could happen ''in the very near future''.
Mr Bert Turpie, engineering services director, said: ''The increase is
entirely due to the use of hoses and garden sprinklers, which are left
unattended for long periods and in some cases are left running
overnight.''
In Strathclyde, Campbeltown reservoir is reported to be running at 40%
capacity and Camphill, near Largs, at 56%, while Girvan in South
Ayrshire is ''fairly low'' and being monitored closely by the region.
A spokeswoman said: ''It's not too bad at the moment but if this
weather continues for another three or four weeks, we might be looking
at taking measures to restrict use.''
Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council confirmed that some remote and
hilly areas in the west of the region had suffered temporary cut-offs
over the past few days and that supply fluctuations in Creetown and
Newton Stewart were causing serious concern.
A spokesman for Lothian region said the situation was ''not too bad''
at present. ''We are fairly well placed,'' he said.
In Tayside, main supply sources were reasonable but officials they
were asking people ''to show a bit of restraint''. There are local
problems at small water sources in Perthshire but water services staff
are maintaining the supply.
Grampian region does not anticipate imposing limits on water
consumption, although it reports that river levels are at their lowest
for some years.
Glasgow Weather Centre forecast showers in the west of Scotland by
Saturday, which could spread across the rest of the country at the
weekend.
In Yorkshire, the Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, Mr Paul Tyler,
said it was ''absurd'' that companies making huge profits could not
guarantee supplies. He added that ''record water charges'' by privatised
firms were unrelated to their quality of service.
Mr Paul Taylor, regional manager of Ofwat Yorkshire, the industry
regulator, said: ''We will have serious talks with Yorkshire Water to
reassess the whole water resource management situation.
''They have got a good system which should enable them to push the
resources into different parts of the region if there are any problems.
We are wondering why that doesn't work properly. We are taking that up
with the company.''
The Department of Environment will rule on Yorkshire Water's
application for a drought order, which would affect 600,000 customers.

Kevin Costner's monster-budget movie is the shrimp that could have
been a shark, maintains William Russell as he previews the futuristic
film full of surprises
WATERWORLD (PG), directed by Kevin Reynolds, on general release from
tomorrow
WATER, water everywhere and not a drop to drink? Hardly, because right
at the start of Waterworld Kevin Costner gives a most interesting
display of how to transform one's urine into drinking water by means of
filtering it through a Heath Robinson contraption of glass tubes and
phials.
Interesting admittedly, but not the most appealing of images with
which to launch what turns out to be, not the disaster epic of legend,
but a thoroughly entertaining adventure set in a world drowned after the
polar ice caps have melted.
It is a case of wet, wet, wet, if ever there was, although not the one
the futurologists predict. Drought is what they foretell.
Costner plays the Mariner, an aquatic Mad Max, half-man, half-fish,
who scavenges the seabed for a living while sailing the seas in a
splendid, rusty catamaran. Earth is more precious than diamonds,
yesterday's metal artefacts are trading goods, and everyone dreams of
finding dry land.
The film's problem is not that it is terrible, but that it cost too
much -- a record #107.8m. The chances of it ever getting its money back
are low, hence the badmouthing.
The director, Kevin Reynolds, who made Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves
with Costner, has done a good job, although he and his star fell out
badly at the editing stage and the finished result may not be all he
hoped for. But good as it is, it remains a terrible waste of money
because the routine sci-fi story does not justify such vast expenditure.
Any tale set almost entirely at sea is going to be costly, but there
were other less justifiable costs and the Atoll, the hideously expensive
floating island on which the tale starts, could easily have been built
on dry land and, with the aid of computer technology, translated to the
waters, which is what eventually happened after the wretched thing sank
in 160 feet of water.
It is never adequately explained how the Mariner -- mad Max in a cod
piece rather than black leather, with gills behind his ears which
facilitate his trade, became half-man half-fish. Max was a family man
driven mad after his wife and child were killed by marauders who roamed
the post-atomic futureworld they lived in.
Costner is an enigma, and has none of Mel Gibson's self-mocking ironic
approach to such roles. Gibson always implies that ''Really it is all
utterly ridiculous, if you think about it, but don't think, just sit
back and enjoy it -- like I am''. Costner, a dull actor when miscast,
could not be funny if he tried and, clearly deadly serious, has no such
self-awareness. He is making a statement about the future, just as he
was about the American dream in Dances With Wolves. That the statement
is banal is neither here nor there. To Kevin it is a Big Thought.
Waterworld has been dubbed Kevinsgate and Kevintar, a reference to
those notorious turkeys, Heaven's Gate and Ishtar, but the comparison is
unfair. The Kevins' crime is not to have ended up with an unwatchable
film, rather, having spent enough money to build a sea elephant, they
have built only a shrimp. It is an amusing, thrilling, occasionally
astonishing shrimp, but it is never a sea elephant -- or even a small
shark.
The best things are the boats, especially the Mariner's catamaran
which is full of surprises. He has a way with a block and tackle which
allows him to soar to the top of the mast, dangle in the air, dive
umpteen feet into the ocean, produce harpoon guns out of nowhere, and
slide down the massive main-sail with the greatest of ease as he fights
the baddies in a style Douglas Fairbanks or Errol Flynn would have
admired.
The baddies, called Smokers -- pirates who ride motorised surfboards
-- are led by Deacon (Dennis Hopper at his most camp, the film's
second-best thing). A one-eyed, balding evil genius seeking dry land,
Deacon gets at least one splendid line -- ''Don't just stand there, kill
something,'' he screams at his henchmen in a moment of crisis.
He is after a map tattooed on the back of a pert little girl, Enola
(Tina Majorino), who lives on the Atoll in the care of Helen, the
obligatory bird in a bikini (Jeanne Tripplehorn). The pair escape with
the Mariner when the Atoll is sacked by Deacon and the remainder of the
film is a chase movie as he pursues them.
The plot logic is faulty, and the reason why Enola draws pictures of
dry land -- some folk memory is locked inside her head -- is never
explained. How did she get it? The map on her back is also a red herring
because when they eventually find the promised land it is by chance.
Majorino is precociously pert, but Tripplehorn makes a dull, pouting
co-ed type foil and she and Costner seem to be living in different
films. Hopper, however, has a whale of time doing what he does best --
being unashamedly outrageous.
Waterworld is fun, Waterworld is lavish, Waterworld is exciting,
Waterworld is far better than Costner's detractors have suggested, but
it remains a film which cost too much. By no means a disaster, it could
still have repercussions for Costner's career.
The amazing against-all-odds success of Dances With Wolves -- seven
Academy Awards, including best director for Costner -- transformed him
into an actor/director who thought he could do no wrong, and had the
clout to be allowed to try whatever he wanted.
The $21m taken in its first weekend at the box office is hopeful, and
there is no reason why word of mouth should prove damaging to its
prospects. But a good first weekend is often due only to curiosity, and
people are certainly curious.
The comparison to draw is with Batman Forever, which took $53m.
Waterworld must earn an awful lot more of it if Kevin is ever to be home
and dry.

A MAN who murdered his friend after a drinking session, then set the
victim's home on fire in an attempt to conceal the crime, was jailed for
life yesterday.
George Robertson, 31, was found guilty by the majority verdict of a
jury at the High Court in Edinburgh of murdering Mr Robert Blewes, 45,
at the victim's flat in Portland Place, Leith, on April 12 this year.
Robertson, single and unemployed, of Muirhouse Drive, Edinburgh, had
denied assaulting Mr Blewes, repeatedly punching and kicking him on the
head and body, and compressing his throat.
He had also denied setting fire to paper, clothing, and furniture in
Mr Blewes's top-floor flat with intent to conceal the crime, destroy
evidence, and defeat the ends of justice.
Robertson said that he and Mr Blewes had been drinking cider laced
with valium and he had fallen asleep. He was awakened by Mr Blewes and
panicked because he thought he was trying to strangle him. There was a
fight in which he punched Mr Blewes.
Mr Robert Henderson QC, defending, suggested that the victim might
have died after the couch toppled, perhaps accidentally, on to his neck.
Following the verdict, Lord Milligan told Robertson that setting fire
to the flat was also a serious matter and he jailed Robertson for three
years on that charge.

David Belcher asks stand-up comics what they love about the Fringe and
what wipes the smile from their faces
AT its best, appearing as a stand-up comic on the Fringe can entail a
multiplicity of arcane pleasures. What rapture to sell more than one
ticket for your show! To play nightly practical jokes on your stand-up
pals in the venue you're sharing! But at it's worst, it can be hellish,
as the following Fringe regulars confess.
A fixture at the Assembly Rooms, sardonic Chicagoan satirist Will
Durst outlines the worst part of Edinburgh as ''the people you meet
there. They're friendly, outgoing, considerate . . . it drives you nuts.
It's definitely not London.'' And best? ''Edinburgh's weather. Dreary,
grey, drizzly, and depressing. Perfect for what I do.'' Because it's
completely unlike what you do? ''Right!''
Sean Lock is again at the Pleasance in his fully-flared original
seventies chalk-stripe suit. His enduring highlight is his first
full-house, alongside the Rubber Bishops, in 1993. ''It's a highlight
because the lowest point, during my Edinburgh debut in 1990, was selling
one ticket during a whole week's run -- and the girl who bought that
ticket went into the wrong room on the night. We'd seen no point
starting the show without her, and when she eventually turned up, full
of apologies, we gave her her money back and took her to the pub.''
Dan Freedman is an exiled Scot whose off-stage mission this year is to
discover whether he's related to Scotland under-21 international striker
Doug Freedman, of Barnet FC.
His venue is the Pleasance. What have been his most/least pleasant
moments? ''I pop up doing crap gags and off-stage voices in other
comedians' shows on an ad hoc basis, and what made my sad life more
bearable last year was regularly gate-crashing Boothby Graffoe's show.
Boothby's a mate, you see, and I derived much joy from disrupting his
show in the most evil way possible,'' he says. ''So I have to say that
if appearing with Boothby was a high point, it was also the low point,
too,'' admits Freedman.
Ford Kiernan and John Paul Leach share After Eight Mince at the Gilded
Balloon, as well as having co-authored a Fringe drama, Don't Start Me,
for Castlemilk People's Theatre. Says Ford: ''The best part of the
Fringe was discovering last year that John Paul and I had a double act
that worked. The worst part of Edinburgh is always the same: having to
suffer the inane drivel of every other comedian in the Late'n'Live bar
at the Gilded Balloon 2.''
After five years of sharing the Fringe spotlight, Ben Keaton brings a
solo show to the Assembly Rooms. ''My high point and low point are one
and the same: winning the Perrier in 1986. It was brilliant, but weird.
It was good because I got a lot of attention very quickly. And it was
bad because I got a lot of attention very quickly.
'' Winning attracts strange attitudes . . . people decide they don't
like you, based on jealousy. And people decide to love you for equally
wrong reasons,'' he says.
''But I'm not being a bitter old fart about the Perrier. I was naive.
I remember going into an Edinburgh restaurant shortly after the result
had been announced, and the whole place stood up and applauded. The
maitre d' asked me to sign the hotel register . . . and the name before
mine was Sean Connery's. I looked at it and thought 'Uh-oh, you're in
trouble.' ''
There was no trouble for Mel and Sue after their Fringe success last
year with Kittens Go Grrr. They undertook a national tour and staged
meaningful discussions with every TV comedy supremo. They return to the
Pleasance with Girls In Uniform.
Sue (Perkins) looks back at Fringes past: ''There were three high
points, all from last year. Bob Downe saying he liked our suits, the
good reviews we got, and going to Glasgow for ambient chill-out vibes
a-plenty at Sonora in the 13th Note where we played computer chess and
chatted to normal Glaswegians who weren't part of the comedy industry.
''There were lots of bleak moments in previous years. Trying to do a
show in a 10am slot. Having to go direct into technical rehearsals --
rigging lights and operating soundtracks with no experience of either --
after a nightmare 11-hour journey to Edinburgh on a coach with no
toilet,'' she says.
Colin Lane, of last year's Perrier winners, Lano and Woodley, views
Edinburgh not so much in terms of best and worst, but from a detached
Australian perspective.
''I always think there's a word missing from the festival's title. It
should be Edinburgh Fringe Stupid Festival . . . because for three weeks
you've 2000 shows competing in a city with a population of 250,000. It's
a madhouse of sell-sell-sell. And no matter how well established you are
in your own country, you'll inevitably find yourself standing in the
rain on the Royal Mile handing out leaflets,'' he says.
But what of those Edinburgh debutants who arrive only with hope. What
do they expect?
Rich Hall is the author of a series of quirkily-downhome tomes (Self
Help For The Bleak is the latest). He won a scriptwriting Emmy for his
work on Late Night With Letterman. A former cast member of Saturday
Night Live, Rich will appear nightly at the Fringe Club.
''From shows I've done in London, I know that you can't just walk out
on a British stage as an American, displaying the wrong attitude. For
instance, I did a routine in London about the Gulf war that ended with
me saying 'Desert Storm -- we won because we . . .' And by the time I
got to the second 'we', the room had gone cold. 'What do you mean by
we?' someone in the crowd shouted. At least I wasn't booed off,'' he
says.
''America, America . . . I was inspired to write Self-Help For The
Bleak by finding all these discarded self-help books in second-hand
stores. Lots of Americans are trying to figure out why they're unhappy,
to put the blame for it somewhere. I say just accept you're unhappy and
get on with it. If your arm's broken, it doesn't matter why: it's still
broken.'' In other words: it doesn't matter why Rich Hall is a funny
American, he just is.
A keen-eyed observer of Sex, Marriage and the American Woman, Diane
Ford professes to journeying Edinburgh-wards from California with low
expectations. ''That way, they might be met . . . I just want people to
laugh and not throw fruit.''
Fringe fruitfulness: let us all pray it will be attained.

JACK Russell is under starter's orders to captain England following
another series of twists and turns in the amazing summer thriller
against West Indies.
Skipper Mike Atherton and senior batsman Graeme Hick are on the
doubtful list for today's crucial fifth Cornhill Test at Trent Bridge
after having aggravated back injuries.
And while England sent out an urgent summons for Yorkshire's David
Byas to join them in Nottingham, Russell -- only recalled to the team
two weeks ago -- was told to prepare for leadership.
Even given that there has never been a dull moment so far this series,
yesterday's developments were amazing.
England had just about come to terms mentally with the loss of Robin
Smith, following a fractured cheekbone sustained at Old Trafford. But if
they now have to do without Atherton and Hick, the odds will once again
swing in West Indies' favour.
Atherton tried to make light of his latest worrying back injury
yesterday, dismissing it as ''just the odd twinge.''
On Atherton, chairman of selectors Ray Illingworth admitted: ''He is
not completely happy with his back and we want to make sure we've got
cover. Of course it's a worry -- it would be a big blow to go in without
him.''
Having nominated Russell as replacement captain if necessary, he said:
''I would have no worries about Jack skippering the side. He's an
experienced cricketer and has done a good job leading Gloucestershire
this season.''
At least the troubles are shared around this time with West Indies
facing four possible changes.
Jimmy Adams, whose cheekbone was fractured at Taunton last week, is
definitely out, while Carl Hooper looks doubtful. Wicketkeeper Junior
Murray seems set to lose his place to Courtney Browne and the tourists
are ''seriously considering'' playing leg-spinner Rajindra Dhanraj for
the first
time in a test match this summer.
* SCOTLAND B slumped to a nine-wicket defeat at the hands of Durham B
in Stockton yesterday. A second innings of 186 all out from the Scots
left Durham needing only 52 runs to win, and the county reached their
target off just 7.2 overs.

CHRIS Eubank yesterday stood by his controversial comment about not
being held responsible if Steve Collins dies in the ring when they meet
again in four weeks time.
The former world champion, still smarting from the loss of the world
title in March, has been ordered before the British Boxing Board of
Control next week to explain his comments which he made after his first
round win over Jose Barreutabera two weeks ago.
The former World Boxing Organisation super-middleweight champion, in
Cork to promote his return on September 9, said he had already written
to the Board.
''Sometimes my mouth goes off quicker than my mind,'' he said. ''But
what I meant to say was that if Collins resorts to hypnotism again next
time we meet and he loses his life because he doesn't know when he is
hurt, then I don't want his mother or the public to blame me.''
Eubank is still insisting that he was ''cheated'' when he lost the
title in March after Collins revealed that he had been seeing
hypnotherapist Tony Quinn. But while Eubank admitted to being
''spooked'' by him last time, he said he would knock him out early next
time.

CHARLIE Nicholas is poised to make his debut for Clyde against Ayr
United at Somerset Park on Saturday.
Clyde manager Alex Smith has revealed he had raised the cash needed to
land the former Scotland striker, and it is now up to the the
33-year-old Celtic player to agree personal terms.
Smith said: ''We should know something very soon and I am hopeful we
will be able to do a deal. I am just waiting for a decision from Charlie
and his agent.
''We have an agreement with a company to sponsor Charlie, but I don't
want to reveal their name until I confirm the player is going to become
a Clyde player. If things go through the way I hope they will, then
Charlie could play at Ayr.''
Smith, who was Nicholas's manager at Pittodrie, believes the Celt can
help lift Clyde into the second division promotion race. ''He has the
class to make those around him better players and he has a great
personality and bubbling confidence.''
* AIRDRIE could find themselves involved in yet another transfer
tribunal after having signed former Scotland under-21 defender Sean
Sweeney from Clydebank.
No fee has been agreed by the clubs for the 26-year-old, who has been
at Kilbowie for 10 seasons.
Airdrie are already due for an appearance at the tribunal tomorrow
week where they will learn the fee they must pay to Hamilton for striker
Peter Duffield.
* WITH striker Andy Smith out for at least eight with a broken leg,
Dunfermline manager Bert Paton has made a move for former Yugoslavian
internationalist Dino Valentic. The former Sarajevo player is presently
with French club Trasilik and is expected to have a week's trial at East
End Park.
''The loss of Smith is a terrible blow since he has started so well
with the club,'' said Paton.

IN her time as artist in residence at the zoo, Sara Gibbins has
concentrated on the links between man and the natural world as well as
those which man has instinctively designed for himself. Her coloured
studies and oils do, at first glance, seem to be typical views of
individual animals -- camels, penguins, bears -- but this is
superficial.
A stunning oil of a flock of penguins swimming under water, Flying,
like a view through a glass-bottomed boat, examines all our
preconceptions. Many of the works are of rare, endangered species such
as the Waldrapp ibis, studied in masterful detail. They are presented in
isolation, silhouetted against white emptiness.
The oils bring a warm palette and background, but even here the
animals look melancholy, with a sadness imposed by man, who has
imprisoned and endangered them. The set of 12 panels, Bestiary, draws
together various themes of the show -- the fading, repeated image of a
tapir, a zebra-striped sofa, an empty zoo enclosure and mythical
gargoyles and griffins are all illusions to man's impact on the animal
world.
The show itself seems to be a bestiary in the old meaning of the word
-- a moralising medieval collection of real or mythical beasts -- from
which man should draw painful conclusions and, hopefully, learn.
Until September 8.

* MUHTARRAM, injured in the Group One Coral-Eclipse Stakes last month,
has been retired to stand at the Nunnery Stud. John Gosden's
six-year-old, twice successful in Group One company abroad, has earned
more than #[1/2]m in total prize money.
As well as his successes in the top flight, the son of Alleged landed
the Group Two Princess of Wales's Stakes on two occasions, the latest
pictured above when getting the better of Eltish at Royal Ascot.
Said Gosden yesterday, ''He was really talented, with a good deal of
speed. He was a real Northern Dancer type who won both his races as a
two-year-old, so anybody going to him will be getting something with a
bit of speed.''
Muhtarram will take his place at the stud alongside Green Desert,
Nashwan, and Unfuwain.
Stud manager Richard Lancaster said: ''We are delighted that his
owner, Sheikh Hamdan Al-Maktoum, has decided that Muhtarram should stand
at Nunnery Stud. He was a high-class racehorse, with excellent form from
2-6 years, and has a first-class pedigree and extremely good
conformation.
''These factors must make him very attractive to breeders.''

For anyone thinking that Alan Ayckbourn's prolific quantity -- this is
his 46th play -- can come at the expense of quality, along comes
Communicating Doors to show us that there's life in the old dramatic
tank yet.
Theatrical ingenuity has always been one of his hallmarks, but here
it's as if he has found a new imaginative freedom to produce something
half approaching a fable, half a Chinese puzzle, about time travel,
female fortitude, and the possibilities for change.
Not that the prospects look too rosy at the start. Ayckbourn's initial
scene-setting lumbers into action with a story to do with a dying
businessman, domestic murder, corporate greed, and some rather weak
jokes tied into the arrival of a rubber-clad dominatrix.
But once Adie Allen's ''sexual specialist consultant'' has blundered
through the time warp and back in time into the bedroom of Julia
McKenzie, the businessman's second and shortly to be murdered wife, the
play takes off. Can the two women work out who they are and where they
are, and stop the future from taking its course?
In his usual way, Ayckbourn spins some wonderfully ingenious -- and
very funny -- tricks, adds a galumphing hotel security guard (John
Arthur in Jim Broadbent mode) as an unwitting aide de camp, and comes up
with a hopelessly optimistic ending.
Part sci-fi, part comedy thriller with Hitchcockian overtones, here,
however, women are shown acting in concert -- not against each other. As
in Woman In Mind, his last, highly successful play with McKenzie,
Ayckbourn shows what a remarkable sympathy he has for his female
protagonists. Needless to say, McKenzie is a delight, proving that as an
interpreter of comic vulnerability she is still without equal.

IT appears that some jockeys just never learn. For instance, the
vastly experienced Chris Rutter should know better than to cross the
sport's governing body, but apparently not, and after the rider appeared
before the Jockey Club Disciplinary Committee for the third time this
season, the powers that be took a dim view of his situation and
suspended Rutter for nine days.
And the lenghty bans did not halt there, for apprentice David McCabe,
making his fourth disciplinary committee appearance so far this season,
also was stood down. Perhaps both riders will now learn their lesson,
but don't count on it.
Yesterday, the committee decided Rutter was guilty of ''irresponsible
riding'' when partnering White Sea into second place behind Hurricane
Dancer in a maiden race at Yarmouth on July 27.
It was decided that White Sea had caused interference to Posen Gold
who was upsides and ''it should have been obvious to Rutter that
interference would result from this manoeuvre.''
If McCabe harboured hopes that the committee would be in a more
lenient frame of mind after lunch, hw was soon in for a big
disappointment. McCabe was pulled up because of his use of the whip on
Power Don again in a maiden event at Hamilton on July 29.
The rider was deemed to have used his whip with ''unreasonable
frequency and with his whip arm above shoulder height.'' He, too, was
given a nine-day ban.
These suspensions bring the number of jockeys currently serving or
awaiting bans to a staggering 22.
* PLEASANT Surprise, the subject of more than #15,000 in major bets at
Beverley yesterday and slashed to 6-5 from 7-4, justified the confidence
with a ready defeat of Belana in the maiden race.
Mark Johnston's colt was providing jockey Darryll Holland with his
fiftieth success of the season.

Hearts 0, Newcastle 1
DESPITE a summer of spending, it was Newcastle golden oldie Peter
Beardsley who earned the Geordies a victory over Hearts, with his neat,
second-half header.
John Colquhoun was the Hearts player who threatened to send Newcastle
back across the Border on the losing side, and in the third minute he
shot over from good position, after first testing Srnicek.
In the seventh minute the same player shot over from good position,
before Smith justified his recall 10 minutes later by blocking a Paul
Kitson effort with a foot.
Gillespie and Kitson were linking well for Newcastle and it took a
smart intervention by Dave McPherson after 32 minutes to clear an
opportunity for Kitson.
David Ginola, just as he did at Parkhead on Saturday, teased with some
wonderful flashes, but the Frenchman played only in snatches.
Hearts looked as if they had taken the lead in 64 minutes when a
Colquhoun corner was helped on by Craig Levein, and then substitute
Colin Cramb flicked the ball past Srnicek. However, with the former
Falkirk player celebrating, Beardsley popped up to clear off the line.
Sixty seconds later Newcastle broke with match winning accuracy, for
when Gillespie crossed from the right, Beardsley beat Smith with his
header from the penalty spot, to seal victory.
HEARTS -- Smith, Locke, Wishart, Levein, McPherson, Hamilton,
Colquhoun, Mackay, Robertson, Johnston, Hagen. Substitutes -- Wright,
Bett, Leitch, Cramb, Nelson.
NEWCASTLE -- Srnicek, Hottiger, Beresford, Barton, Peacock, Elliot,
Lee, Beardsley, Kitson, Gillespie, Ginola. Substitutes -- Fox, Harper,
Clark, Watson, Sellars.
Referee -- W Crombie (Edinburgh).

THERE are three things in Scotland that are beyond a joke. The first
is the Oban Times. The second is its readership, and the third is the
readership's drinking habits.
Now look what's happened! Two days ago You Know Who insulted two of
the three holies of that most holy trinity. ''How do you keep the
natives off the booze long enough for them to pass their driving test?''
asks Prince Philip. Ochone! Ochone! I've never heard the like of it in
all my life.
Oh yes I have. That was not just a royal joke. Yon was a special
category joke. Sitting in court I hear jokes like that all the time.
Royal jokes are like judges' jokes. Everybody laughs heartily at them
for fear of being seen to be odd man out. Later we take both joke and
joker apart. I'll say this for Prince Philip; his Oban joke is better
than most judges' jokes. I cannot praise fainter than that.
Of course, the real news story has been missed by all the scribblers.
The real happening is not that the royal made an Oban joke, but that he
found anything in Oban to make a joke about. I know Oban. I love Oban.
It's my adopted home town. I've been in Oban and of Oban and about Oban
for quarter of a century, and although to those who were born there I'm
still an incomer, to me the town is much more a home place than Paisley
where I was most truly born.
I know there are cynics who will say that even hell would be a better
home place than Paisley, but we ignore such crude remarks.
I hope Oban will ignore Prince Philip's remarks as easily. Somehow I
doubt it. I've been deeved for weeks and weeks by elderly Obanites
talking about the last royal visit 50 years ago. They say it rained all
the time. From much exposure to Oban rain I would not have thought that
a rainstorm was something to remember here for 50 years. This shows the
difference in the thought processes of an incomer.
Ach! I shouldn't have written that bit about Oban and the rain. The
trouble with places you love is that you cannot help making snide
remarks about them.
A few years ago when somebody knocked down Oban station I claimed that
if they did that to the rest of the town it would vastly improve it. The
station held the only public clock in the West Highlands, so for good
measure I added that no-one has kept an appointment on time since the
clock was taken away. No-one kept an appointment on time in Oban before
it was taken away, but that's another matter.
The truth about Oban should occasionally be told, and it's a very
simple truth. Oban is a wonderful place, and the view from MacCaig's
Folly across Kerrera to Mull is the most beautiful in the world.
Vesuvius blows fumes and smoke in envy over the Bay of Naples at the
very thought of Oban. The only better view I know than the one from
MacCaig's Folly is the same view from Pulpit Hill with a glass or two of
Oban Malt in my waim. I hope the royal prince had been to Stafford
Street before he made his grand wee joke. Sometimes a sensation or two
of Oban Malt has that effect.
I hope no-one's hurt by what he said or takes it too seriously. It's
what the people in universities call a periphery joke. People who live
north or west of centre are supposed to be glaiket, so jokes are made of
us. We children of MacCaig's Folly can take it.
Robert Drummond, the man to whom the joke was made, is a neighbour of
mine. We both live in the world-famous village of Connel, the
Bearsden-on-Sea of the whole West Highlands. He will have something to
tell his children about how he jested with the father of a dynasty.
The next time I see Bob I won't be asking him about the Duke of
Edinburgh's joke. He'll have a much harder question to answer. What I
really want to know is the answer to the duke's question. How, just how,
does he really manage to keep his customers off the booze long enough
for them to pass their driving test? Or should we really leave the
matter to those who find judges' jokes uproariously funny?

HAZARD A Guess can steal the headlines in the Rapid Lad Stakes at
Beverley this afternoon.
All eyes will be on Vindaloo in this race as he bids to set a
twentieth Century record with his tenth handicap win of the season.
Of Vindaloo's chance, trainer Jimmy Harris said: ''I'm semi-confident.
He's had a fortnight's rest which has done him good and he is well and
in good form with himself.
''Realistically I think he's about a 6-1 chance but we'll be giving it
a go.''
The presence of dual Cambridgeshire winner Mellottie and the Michael
Stoute-trained Senorita Dinero adds spice to a contest worthy of the
#8000 prize money.
However, Hazard A Guess looks a good bet to overturn each of that
trio.
Impressive victories at Beverley and Pontefract this term suggest that
he is better than ever at the age of five. He ran an excellent race when
a strong-finishing fifth to Yoush in one of the hottest handicaps of the
season at Sandown last month.
And a seemingly modest effort at Pontefract is best ignored as he was
held up too far off the pace to have any chance of victory in a
slowy-run race.
Jockey Kieran Fallon is unlikely to make the same mistake today when
Hazard A Guess can register his third course victory.
It is worth looking for a lightly-raced, progressive sort in the Tote
Bookmakers Handicap, in which most of the runners are either fully
exposed or handicapped up to their best form. None fits the bill better
than Prince of Spades.
He has improved in leaps and bounds this year and gained his second
win in three starts in a contest at Brighton last month.
Though he faced only two rivals that day, it still needed a fair
performance to beat the hat-trick-seeking Soviet Bride, and he is
certainly still on the upgrade.
The well-bred three-year-old will be seen to even better advantage now
that he drops back in trip to a mile, a distance which has always seemed
likely to prove his forte.
Front-running Cheyenne Spirit may well have been flattered when second
in a modest Listed race at Goodwood last month, and she is worth
opposing in the Stokesley Conditions Stakes at Yarmouth.
Tough and consistent Inzar looks a better alternative after his fine
effort to finish a close eighth under 9st 6lb in the Stewards' Cup last
time out.
David Nicholson can put one over Martin Pipe, his predecessor as
champion National Hunt trainer, in the Travis Perkins Handicap Hurdle at
Newton Abbot.
His Jathib looks more than good enough to complete a hat-trick in
receipt of 4lb from Pipe's Irkutsk.
* MARY Reveley's Foundry Lane has been cut to 8-1 by one leading firm
of bookmakers (from 10-1) following further support for the Tote Ebor
Handicap at York on Wednesday.

SERIOUS Hurry, the bargain horse who defied predictions that he would
never race again, gave trainer Robert McKellar his third winner of the
season at Hamilton last night.
McKellar bought the seven-year-old gelding for 500gns at Doncaster
Sales in September but was told he would never get him on a racecourse.
A vet who examined the horse at McKellar's Lesmahagow yard said he was:
''a goner.''
But the trainer and his wife, Linda, nursed Serious Hurry back to full
health and on his eleventh run this year he came good in the Scottish
Rifles Apprentices Handicap over five furlongs.
Serious Hurry (14-1) bounced out of the stalls last night to take an
early lead, and kept in front to the line beating Just Bob.
McKellar, whose three winners have all been at Hamilton, said: ''His
previous trainer, David Nicholls, said I would never get him on a
racecourse. When we got him home he lay in the paddock for a week and
never moved. My wife sat up with him and slowly but surely we nursed him
back to health.''
Bred by the Duke of Marlborough, Serious Hurry won six times at
Lingfield when trained at Newmarket by Sir Mark Prescott.
It was a day of mixed fortunes for Jack Berry. At Salisbury in the
afternoon Lucky Parkes won but was disqualified, and although
Traceability romped home, the trainer lost the two-year-old through a
''hostile'' claim.
Berry was at Hamilton last night to see Moi Canard win the Hyndford
Claiming Stakes at 11-4, but not before he had survived an objection and
a stewards' inquiry.
The #10,000 William Hill Scottish Trophy Handicap produced a
tremendous finish involving four of the 12 runners.
Sarmatian (6-1) hit the front two furlongs out and held on by a head
from Habeta, with Talented Ting and Thatched snapping at their heels.
Ally McCoist, otherwise engaged at Ibrox, was one of the four winning
owners of Sarmatian.
George Duffield appeared to leave it very late on Mister Westsound,
the 11-4 favourite in the Cameronians Handicap, but Linda Perratt's
three-year-old came with a tremendous burst of speed in the final
furlong to triumph for the second time in six days.
It was the seventh winner of the season for the Ayr trainer.
Favourite backers did not end the night on a high note when Opus One
could finish only third behind Vain Prince in the Earnock Handicap.
The Popular Milngavie, trained by Scot Mark Johnston, finished second,
and the places remained unaltered after the stewards had inquired into
the finish of the race.

SOME of the most memorable performances at the Aberdeen International
Youth Festival are never seen by the general public. For when the
participants have returned at night to the university campus where they
are staying they party -- and every night, it is the responsibility of
one of the national groups to entertain all the others.
At Tuesday's concert something of that spirit leaked through into the
official programme when the Royken Girls' Choir from Norway, in gorgeous
national costume, broke out of the customary choir formation and began
crossing and recrossing the platform in a perfectly timed step dance as
they sang, beautifully, a selection of Scottish folk songs.
Their accompanist, 16-year-old Jorunn Skaar, then played part of
Ravel's Miroirs, a stunningly mature performance on the piano that just
gave the girls time to change into crazy sixties gear for a riotous
medley of Beatles songs.
Earlier on, their programme did have its more serious side, but tended
to leave that side of things to the Dziannitsa Choir from Gomel State
University. A selection of Belorussian and Russian choral music,
including two pieces by the splendidly named Russian composer
Archangelsky, conjured up visions of incense-laden cathedrals with
candle-lit processions of venerable bearded Orthodox clergy in golden
jewel-encrusted vestments. The rich vocal sonorities and harmonies from
deep basses to soaring sopranos were endlessly evocative.
Their selection of ''foreign composers'' -- which meant Mozart, Elgar,
and Strauss -- was less successful, mostly far too slow, but the
concluding folk song section, including Kalinka, curiously upstaged by a
marvellous arrangement of Santa Lucia, guaranteed the choir a thunderous
reception.

IF one swallow does not a summer make, then one hot summer does not
prove global warming. Nevertheless, sightings of rare butterflies in
parts of Scotland -- although far more have been seen in East Anglia,
Suffolk and Norfolk -- are causing a stir among scientists who consider
them indicators of climate change.
The Camberwell Beauty, nymphalis antiopa, considered to be a very
exciting migrant butterfly, has been seen in Loch Leven, Culzean and
Galashiels, and at least three dozen times across England.
Bob Savile, of the Scottish Wildlife Trust, said: ''This is a very
rare butterfly from Scandinavia. We are trying to get as many people as
possible to record sightings of all migrant species and tell us about
them.
''Certain years are invasion years -- the last time we saw the
Camberwell Beauty was 1976, also a very hot summer.''
A tip from him to anyone hoping to attract one of these exotic
butterflies into their garden is to lay out a mash of ripe bananas and
beer, although he does not guarantee success.
The British Trust for Ornithology, which monitors rare sightings
across Britain, has reported large numbers of unusual butterflies and
dragonflies, particularly in the South of England. The most northerly
sighting of the Yellow-winged Darter dragonfly has been in North
Yorkshire -- although if the current heatwave continues, said BTO
spokesman Mike Crewe, they may well find their way up to Scotland.
Dr Allan Watt, a specialist in forest entomology at the Institute of
Terrestrial Ecology, said that the ITE and Aberdeen University had been
studying the distribution of rare butterflies and day-flight moths in
Scotland this summer and had more sightings of the Burnet Moth and the
Ringlet and Northern Brown Argus butterflies.
''Generally it is a very favourable year for butterflies. But, in
Scotland in particular, whether butterflies actually survive through a
whole life cycle is very weather-dependent. In the South of England a
lot of them will go through two life cycles when in Scotland it will be
only one.
''It is one thing saying they are doing well, but another that they
are spreading,'' he said.
Nevertheless, the Ringlet and Northern Brown Argus butterflies have
been moving farther north over the past two years, very possibly,
believes Dr Watt, because of increased summer temperatures.
The other side of the coin, of course, is that if long hot summers
increase some populations, they decrease others, particularly those that
live in wet, boggy areas, like the midge.
However, recent warnings by television weather forecasters that
malaria-carrying mosquitoes were spreading north are, said Dr Watt,
''completely over the top''.
Most people this summer have noticed a higher-than-normal wasp count.
But numbers of all similarly cold-blooded insects have risen.
''The wasps will go through their life cycles faster and their
survival is likely to increase, but because they are all likely to
respond well, that includes their natural enemies,'' he said.
Dr Watt added, however, that winters are probably much more important
than summer weather conditions generally when it comes to insects such
as the greenfly.
If, indeed, this hot summer is more than a fluke and is part of an
overall change in climatic conditions, there will be implications for
certain vulnerable species.
Any hot, dry summer can threaten the oblong woodsia, a small mountain
fern, already pinpointed by Scottish Natural Heritage as a threatened
species.
Arctic species can only move farther north to colder climes if the
geography allows them to do so. But agricultural and commercial forestry
practices mean that some plants cannot move north.
The Scottish primrose, for example, another of the species targeted in
SNH's action programme, is now found only on the northern coast of
Scotland and parts of Orkney. If temperatures heat up, the Scottish
primrose will have nowhere else to go.
Both the ptarmigan and the mountain hare go white in winter, but Dr
Vincent Fleming, SNH's senior bio-diversity adviser, is concerned that
both would suffer in a warmer climate. The ptarmigan would have nowhere
to go if temperatures rose, and the mountain hare would probably be
unable to compete with the brown hare of the Lowlands.
''Some species would not be affected -- the osprey, Scots pine, or
golden eagle -- which all occur in warmer climes,'' said Dr Fleming.
But what might we gain? More exotic butterflies, certain birds,
insects, and perhaps some of the orchids currently found only in the
South of England.
Yesterday, as fires raged across peat bogs at Longriggend, near
Airdrie -- one of a series of drought-induced fires this summer -- SNH
warned of the potential long-term damage to Scottish lowland peatlands,
among the most important areas of conservation in European terms that we
have in Scotland.
Already degraded by land-use patterns and deliberate fire-raising,
some of the peat bogs, with their precious stores of sphagnum mosses and
dependent life-forms, face extinction.

TUESDAY night at the hideous disco-cum-Cotton Club offered what was
undoubtedly the most consistently excellent bill of fare that jazz fest
followers have yet enjoyed. The reign of the apparently unstoppable
Swedish Jazz Kings came to a triumphant end, with a version of Papa Dip
which featured a memorable newspaper-ripping-over-the-mike solo.
They were succeeded onstage by an all-star ensemble under the
direction of pianist Dick Hyman. This was one helluva class act, and one
which was distinguished by the buoyant presence of New Orleans singer
Topsy Chapman, who has been making an impressive Edinburgh debut with
the Hot Antic Jazz Band.
Even on a blues like Billie Holiday's Fine and Mellow, Chapman's
sumptously rich vocals lifted the spirit.
On Basin Street Blues and the raunchy, stomping version of Everybody
Loves My Baby, complete with verse, Chapman -- an unfussy, natural and
unforced singer -- was reminiscent of Louis Armstrong; so infectious was
the smile that regularly seemed to wash all over her face. No wonder she
was happy: in Hyman, baritone saxophonist John Barnes, and her sturdy
British rhythm section she had the ideal combination of accompanists.
Just when it seemed that things couldn't get any better, they did, as
the same band was joined by a six-trumpet front line to perform
arrangements which Hyman wrote for a celebrated Louis Armstrong memorial
concert in the 1970s.
This was a delight from start to finish: the trumpeting sextet divided
into two trios for most of the numbers, the absolute highlights being
Weather Bird Rag as played by Hyman and the A-team (of Bob Barnard, Bent
Persson, and Bruce Adams) and a splendid joint version of Willie the
Weeper. Louis would have been grinning.

YES, dear reader . . . it's that time of the year when a magazine
editor's former life becomes a distant memory. Three issues in three
weeks, 500 shows to cover, and 650 Fringe performers plus assorted
publicists and promoters all coming at you with the doggedness of a
rabid pitbull.
Not that I don't love it -- of course I do. That rumour about a former
editor of The List keeping a sleeping bag under her desk for those
all-night festival vigils must have got out, and it's true -- some
nights it hardly seems worth going home.
Although one very good reason for escaping to the sanctity of your own
four walls is to get away from the phone, which does not let up, ever.
Full of festival fun, The List's 104-page preview issue hits the
streets today complete with an Eating Out guide and Book Festival
supplement. Before you can say: ''I say, Mr Newsagent, what a fantastic
magazine, give me a copy this instant,'' we'll be at it again,
commissioning a crack team of ace reviewers to get out there, pencils
poised and notebooks at the ready.
Between now and Monday, we will have reviewed more than 150 shows,
interviewed everyone from Mark Morris to Margarita Pracatan, and thrown
the annual List party, considered by many to be the party of the
festival.
Meanwhile, as various performers and their entourages arrive in the
city, the office speculates on who will pull off this year's best
publicity stunt.
We all agree that it's going to be hard to beat Jim Rose, who last
year treated us to a UK premiere of a show entitled Jim Rose's Organ
Origami (and when I say organ, I'm not talking the kind with a
keyboard). Jim performed his extraordinary bodily contortions for us
slap-bang in the middle of the office in the hope of securing a front
cover. It's incredible the lengths that some folk will go to.
So far, we've got our money on Club Swing (erotica with fruit on the
high trapeze). We have very low ceilings in The List offices, girls,
just in case you're thinking of paying us a visit.
By August 24, when our third issue is out, reality will suddenly bite
and my former life will come staggering back to me as I realise that I
have no clean clothes, and nothing in my fridge apart from a half bottle
of vodka.
I will also discover that I am, apparently, the most popular woman in
the world on account of the 50 telephone calls from people I haven't
seen for years, announcing ''please, oh please, can we crash because our
arrangements have fallen through at the last minute''.
Consequently, my flat will be trashed and ceremoniously strewn with
unidentified bodies. There will be strange men that I don't know using
up the toothpaste.
Last year it was three Bosnian film-makers who needed a place to
stayfor a few nights and ended up staying for two weeks. Thinking of
them now is good therapy. I wonder how they're doing in war-torn
Sarajevo and remember how the Edinburgh Festival, founded in 1947, was
intended as a symbol of peace and reconciliation throughout Europe. A
sobering thought, worth remembering now just as much as it was then.

A new, younger breed of councillor has emerged for Scotland's unitary
authorities, Frances Horsburgh finds, but women are still trailing
badly.
THE first survey of the background and attitudes of the men and women
who will run Scotland's new unitary councils is published this week.
These are the 1161 councillors who were elected earlier this year to
the 29 new mainland councils which take control of local government
services next April. Just over half of the new councillors belong to the
Labour Party.
The average Scottish councillor who has come into focus under the
survey's microscope is male and over 45 years old. He has a job and is a
homeowner with a college or university education. He is also likely to
have had previous experience of being a regional or district councillor.
But the profile is changing, with almost 40% of completely new members
aged under 45 compared with about 27% of existing councillors.
Just over a fifth of the new councillors are female, confirming that
women remain badly under-represented in local, as well as national,
politics in Scotland.
Changes, such as the introduction of a child-care allowance and
flexibility in council meeting times, could help more of them serve in
local government.
In the survey, one in every three women councillors indicated they
would have to make special child-care arrangements in order to conduct
their council business. Only one in 10 male councillors said the same
thing.
Although a larger percentage of women councillors were graduates
compared with men, a much higher proportion worked part-time and almost
half fell within the lowest income band of less than #10,000 a year
compared with a quarter of the men.
The survey was carried out by the Glasgow-based Scottish Local
Government Information Unit and the Scottish Local Authorities
Management Centre at Strathclyde University.
SLGIU convener Councillor Jean McFadden said it was a great pity women
were not better represented. They were greater consumers of local
government services in general than men, she said. For instance, they
tended to have the role of looking after children, which involved
education, or they cared for elderly relatives and used social work
services. They also used public transport more often.
''Local government requires input from both men and women. A few
enlightened councils have come to grips with the fact that most women
have family responsibilities. The rest must follow suit,'' she said.
The survey also found that almost half of Scotland's councillors
support a change in the local electoral system from first-past-the-post
to proportional representation. A majority also support the case for
constitutional change.
Within each party the level of support for PR was as follows -- 94% of
Liberal Democrats, 90% of SNP councillors, 26% of Labour councillors,
29% of Independents / Others, and just 2% of Conservatives.
More than 85% of councillors support change in the way Scotland is
governed. Almost 60% want a Scottish parliament with tax-raising powers,
and 21% want independence for Scotland.
Although only 14% support the maintenance of the status quo, this
includes a high percentage (36%) of Independent / Other councillors.
The survey also reveals widely differing perceptions of the main role
of a councillor in the new unitary authorities. Almost a third of all
members said that representing their constituents' interests was the
main role of a councillor today. The second most common perception was
the role of ensuring and overseeing the delivery of effective and
efficient local government services.
Councillors as policy makers was the next most favoured option,
closely followed by the wide function of serving the community.
The survey also shows that new councillors may be underestimating the
time they will have to spend on council business. While new councillors
thought they might have to spend an average of 24 hours a week in this
way, their more experienced colleagues anticipated having to put aside
about 40 hours.
The majority of councillors emphasised the high level of support and
training they would need to cope effectively with an increasing workload
and the changes brought about by the move to single-tier councils.
New council members may be getting younger but a quarter of all
members are aged over 60 with only 9% under 35. The largest group falls
within the 45-54 age range. Sixty percent of councillors have an annual
income of less than #16,000 a year.
A fifth of all councillors are retired, the largest group of 34% work
full time and 8% are employed on a part-time basis. One in 10
councillors is currently unemployed.
Of those councillors who have a job, more than a third are in
professional and managerial categories and only 8.5% are in manual or
unskilled jobs.
SLGIU director Paolo Vestri said the survey provided ''a unique
insight'' into the background of Scotland's new councillors and also
provided very interesting information about their views on key political
issues.
He added that the survey had confirmed there was still a large gender
gap among councillors and the political parties had much work to do to
bridge it.

MY first taste of the Fringe slips down nicely. A one-man show written
and performed by Michael Nears, produced by Salisbury Playhouse, it
tackles the prickly subject of the homeless being cleared from the
streets. It is particularly pertinent while Edinburgh's dossers claim
they are being hassled by the tourist police.
After a lovable rogue, Dicky, saves his life from a mugger, Quaker
lawyer Timothy tries to help a homeless group, at first gifting them
soup (the broccoli and stilton and carrot and orange varieties damned as
''difficult'' by Irish crone Patricia) then zealously campaigning for
houses for them -- well-meant intervention but ultimately disastrous.
Near's script is crisply intelligent and his performance, voicing six
roles, is vigorous, creating moments of pathos but never indulgent
sentiment.
A thoughtful, involving piece.

WILLIAM RUSSELL writes that Nato, under pressure to include former
Warsaw Pact states in its membership, appears wary of the inevitable
change
THE cold war ended five years ago with the fall of the Berlin Wall and
the disbandment, as the Soviet Union collapsed, of the Warsaw Pact. The
shape of European security and defence had been dictated since the end
of the Second World War by its existence, hence the need for Nato as the
organisation which bound the other super power, the United States, to
Europe.
But changed circumstances require that Nato also change, and that is
proving a slow process with the organisation hesitant in its attitude to
those former Warsaw Pact states who are anxious to join, although
accepting that there must be change.
The questions to be faced up to are how rapidly Nato should respond to
their knockings at the door; how precisely it should be enlarged, while
remaining manageable in size; how change can be achieved without
weakening American involvement; and how all this can be done without
unnecessarily alarming Russia about the implications for its security.
The Commons Defence Committee is in no doubt about the inevitablity of
enlargement in its report published yesterday, but argues that this
should not be simply to the east but also to the north and south.
The new states must be ''suitably qualified'' it says, calling for a
more open discussion of at least approximate target dates for
enlargement. The assumption, which is widely shared, is that some of the
newcomers will be admitted within the next decade.
One factor affecting change is the way the European Union is
developing. It too is in the throes of adding to its members, of
defining its powers, of looking at security policy and at foreign
policy. On the answers to those questions depend some of the answers to
the questions about Nato.
Nato is not a stagnant organisation, but a developing one, and changes
include the reductions in force levels, the realignment of force
structures, and the creation of new groupings like the Allied Command
Europe Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC). The crisis in the former Yugoslavia
has concentrated minds.
In 1992 Nato became involved there on behalf of the United Nations
acting, in effect, as an enforcement agency with its ships patrolling
the Adriatic to enforce UN sanctions, and its aircraft involved in
enforcing the no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina. Nato has the ability
to manage such operations and that is one reason for valuing its
continued existence. There is nothing to take its place.
Under the Washington Treaty, Nato was set up with a clearly defined
sphere of interest, but in practice the member nations have many vital
interests outside that area which have involved adapting its activities
to meet needs, as events in the former Yugoslavia have shown. Set up to
counter the threat of Soviet aggression it has no remit for operations
outside the immediate Nato arena, and the committee believe it is
important it should expand its horizons beyond the strict terms of the
Treaty.
The previously dormant Western European Union, the European
community's military arm, has been revived to bridge the gap between the
limitations of American foreign policy, the restrictions imposed by
Nato's remit, and EU concerns over the civil and ethnic conflict on its
frontiers. But it is by no means in a position to take over Nato's role.
The British view is that an enhanced WEU is a potentially useful link
between Europe and Nato's European forces, where the issues to be
tackled do not concern the United States, and that is probably the right
way to proceed.
The previous Foreign Secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, in a speech earlier
this year, said that Europe could not and should not expect direct
American involvement in every crisis or operation in Europe or on the
periphery. He cited WEU as the possible umbrella organisation for
action, suggesting that through it the forces to help evacuate people
from war zones, and help with humanitarian assistance might be
available. In the end the forces deployed would be those allocated to
Nato, but it would allow the US to stand back, as indeed it has over the
crisis in the former Yugoslavia.
France, however, sees the WEU as providing a way forward for a purely
European-led alliance. The stumbling block to such an ambition, however,
is the money involved. Even with the combined military resources of the
UK, France, and Germany, as well as Italy, Spain and the rest, the costs
of compensating for the loss of US contribution to Nato in logistical
support, transport and intelligence would be formidable. At a guess
Europe's taxpayers would have to increase their contributions to defence
spending by about $70 billion a year at a time when the budgets of all
concerned are falling.
Some idea of the scale is provided by the fact that Britain's entire
defence budget, one of the highest in Europe, stands currently at $21.7
billion. In other words, it is not on, and the foreseeable future lies
in Nato.
The 1996 Intergovernmental Conference will be looking at European
defence. It is important that both Europe and Nato take full account of
the changes taking place in the other. The future expansion of the two
organisations may be seperate issues, but they have a common interest in
ensuring a harmonious end result.
The North Atlantic Council last year was agreed about the pace and
manner of Nato expansion which should make the task of the IGC easier,
while Nato in its turn has to recognise there is a growing European
dimension to the defence and security issue. The 1994 Summit drew up the
concept of Combined Joint Task Forces and the report believes this
should be given concrete effect so that the WEU and the Nato ministerial
meetings this winter could ratify it.
What is in our interests, given the close relationship -- although the
closeness is variable -- we have with the United States is to guard
against any steps taken by our European allies which tend to weaken the
transatlantic link. The report, warning that nobody should assume the US
commitment to Europe is immutable, urges that Britain play, as it has
done in the past, the pivotal role in cementing the Alliance. It is up
to us to warn our European partners of ''the dangers of embarking on
fanciful chimeras which might irreparably weaken it,'' the report adds.
Nato has a future because there is no alternative. Other purely
European institutions may develop in time, but it will be a slow
process. It is a case of making the most of the institution we have, of
adapting it to meet the current needs rather than scrapping it in favour
of something untried, and of exploiting the Nato ties that bind the US
to Europe in the common interest. The way ahead lies through the
expansion of Nato, but gradually, and ensuring in the meantime that
greater attention be paid to the reform and repair of what we have.

AS A dissection of the motivations behind casual violence, this play
by Richard Turner and Kenn Price probes the male psyche impressively but
its execution, despite being directed by Turner, with Price performing,
is initially less convincing.
Its real-time progression means that the first 10 minutes are too
often wasted in silences which are neither meaningful nor tense but are
simply spent waiting for a kettle to boil, as two night watchmen, one
young and new to the job, share a cuppa and wearily psyche one another
out.
However, after a somewhat sluggish start it tightens up, distinguished
by compelling performances from Price and David Little, who bristles
with an engaging edginess.
Their confrontation eventually erupts in a surprising act of violence,
which hits you in the guts.

THE small town of Kirriemuir, gateway to the glens of Angus, basks in
the unrelenting sunshine yesterday luring a steady stream of tourists
into its pristine centre and long-established Italian ice-cream shop. A
picture-postcard scene of tranquility. Only some might say too tranquil.
A headline on a newspaper billboard crinkling in the hot afternoon sun
informs Kirrie's residents that the town is in danger of becoming one
big old people's home, a sort of fading Bournemouth in the glens whose
elderly population is on the increase and whose opportunities for its
young people neglected.
Yesterday's image crisis relates to the granting of permission of
Angus District Council for a new residential home in a town already
served by a clutch of old-age people's homes and whose age profile is
already higher than the regional average. According to Tayside Regional
Council 22.9% of Kirriemuir's population is over retirement age compared
with 20% for the region.
The proposal has been put forward by local solicitor John Sheriff and
subject to social work department registration. He says he is
considering transforming his property at Kirktonhill into a home for 10
elderly people.
It is a seemingly modest scheme but one which has drawn sharp
criticism in the form of a written objection from the town's four
health-centre doctors and opened debate on just how large an elderly
population a small town can accommodate.
Quick to kick up a close the idea that he has branded Kirrie ''one big
old people's home'', Dr Andrew Lendrum nevertheless feels Kirrie cannot
afford to carry on building residential homes. He said doctors at the
Tayside Health Board-funded health centre were concerned at the district
council's apparent lack of planning and future thought as to how the
town should develop. Kirriemuir, he says, has three residential homes
and one nursing home where, he asks, do the council intend to stop.
''We have a big community of elderly people and that is an extra
commitment in terms of health-care resources. Already half of our
patients are elderly and that involves time in terms of call-outs. Our
objection to the home was on the grounds of resources.''
Dr Lendrum described Kirrie as a vibrant place but said he would like
to see developments concentrated on the interests of its young people.
In his office in the town centre Sheriff maintained he was unaware
that the health centre had objected to the home and took something of a
moral stance on the provision of accommodation for the elderly. ''I am
amazed at the health centre and their attitude. The impression that has
been given is that the elderly are a burden. Instead of criticising
people like myself or the elderly or the council they should be taking
up the issue of funding with the Government.''
At the suggestion of being a burden eyebrows were raised among the
town's elderly ice cream-eaters enjoying a cone on the benches in the
town centre. A general discussion concluded that while Kirrie did have
an image of something of an old people's town the elderly had every
right to retire to pleasant surroundings in a town with a good bus
service, a golf course, and magnificent scenery.
A similar view was echoed by one of the town's ministers preparing
teas in the town's Pilgrim's Coffee Shop. Taking a break from the
kitchen sink, Pastor Albert Norris painted a picture of Kirrie as an
expanding dormitory town, home to a new breed of commuters snapping up
semis in the schemes sprouting up in the fringes of the town and working
in Dundee and Aberdeen.
As for the elderly, he agreed they placed an extra financial burden on
the health service but said: ''These are the people who paid for the
National Health Service while young people nowadays can take out
insurance. I think the health centre has an axe to grind.
But on Kirrie's streets and in its shops there was some sympathy for
the doctors' point of view and a feeling that Kirrie offers very little
to its young people. Employment is limited to small businesses, retail
and agriculture. In the estate agents -- yards from the birthplace of J
M Barrie, author of the ever-youthful Peter Pan -- Community Councillor
Gladys Wilson said: ''The doctors are quite right in the view that their
limited resources in a growing town are taken up with the elderly. I
would say that Kirrie has always had a high proportion of elderly people
as well a people who who retire here because it is a nice place. That is
a cause for concern. My view is that Kirrie should do more to develop
its image as a centre for tourists in the summer and somewhere to enjoy
winter activities.''

IN the world's biggest international festival of the arts, what better
than a play about the relationship between the war in Central Europe and
the theatre? But I think playwright Allan Sharpe has missed the point.
His ironic drama, about a Sarajevan theatre being turned into a
hospital, gives rise to a semi-focused bread-and-circuses kind of
debate.
Fifth Estate's production varies from scenes of gripping emotional
intensity to others of plain preposterousness and still others that seem
more like Casualty with guns.
But a fascinating aspect of the real Sarajevo is that the theatre
still survives, not as a miracle cure or a school for disguise, as
Sharpe seems to have it, but as a vital method of communication against
terrible odds. And that is surely a phenomenon worthy of closer
scrutiny.

Bob Crampsey highlights the difficulties when sport is played for
money's sake.
WE are at the beginning of the greatest ever revolution in team sports
-- or for that matter individual sports -- since the whole concept of
spectating came to us in the late nineteenth century.
The decision of the Scottish Rugby Union this week to pay top-level
players is certain to create as many problems as it solves. It is
another step on the journey from the Contest to the Event, the one
rooted in tradition and genuine rivalry, the other formless and
constantly changing with the sponsor's name.
Will any game survive on a largely amateur basis? It will not be rugby
union despite the doubtless sincere protestations of Scottish officials.
Hitherto rugby watchers, not all that strong numerically, have
transferred weekly club allegiance to three of four international
fixtures per season. Not no more! The figure offered to our top 50 or so
players has been put at #35,000 per man.
Already there are rumblings from some of the Scottish players that the
Kiwis are on four times that and they want parity of esteem. To the
objective observer they do not seem to possess parity of ability.
Pay them #35,000 or #100,000, it is certain that the cash dispenser,
the SRU, will want some control over how often and where the select
half-century plays in the course of the season. It seems likely that the
club commitments of such players will dwindle almost to vanishing point.
This process may be hastened by the fact that club fixtures may well be
between Glasgow South and Edinburgh West, two names to stir the blood as
the best talent clusters around a handful of honeypots.
Optimistically it is thought that the Murrayfield habitues will be
happy to cough up another tenner to fund Scott, Craig, and the other
lads. I wonder, especially when the bad times come. It may be left to
the Hillfoots, and the Panmures, to preserve the spirit of the game
along with those smaller historic Border clubs which will be unable to
compete in the new age.
Not much comfort in the world of association football either for those
who just like the game. One cannot cite Queen's Park, even as an
exception to the rule, for the stark reality is that Queen's have no
existence except in professional surroundings.
The game is now totally at the mercy of television and the
thick-and-thin spectator takes second place to the casually smart
attender who will pick his half-dozen or so matches a year.
This is not a whine against the inevitable and not all TV-led
initiatives have been harmful. It is thanks to them that we now have cup
finals decided on the day, a clear benefit to those who have taken the
trouble to come long distances. It is however a protest against the
trivialisation of prestigious trophies like the European Cup where the
whole thrust of the competition appears to be geared to the prevention
of top sides going out early.
We had better watch out in this small, fair land of ours, because a
very logical way of doing this would be to rig the draw according to the
number of TV receivers each country has.
Last weekend we were encouraged -- and astonished -- when the Scottish
amateur golf champion Simon Mackenzie turned out to have a normal job of
work during the day. Now there's a novelty. Doesn't stop the trend
whereby good amateur golf is merely the dentist's waiting-room for the
professional game.
Surely Scottish cricket then? Perhaps. Limited to one professional per
side, but on reading match reports each weekend I am struck by the
number of Australians, Indians, New Zealanders and Pakistanis fired by a
sudden urge to play cricket in a comparative backwater.
The great tussle in major sports over the next decade or so is going
to be the attempts of the various governing bodies to retain the control
which they have traditionally exercised. The governing bodies are losing
and in the short term will continue to lose.
Athletes will run when and where they like. There are hidden costs
here. If athletes are being handsomely paid -- although stand by for
this being the first sport to suffer the sponsors' cuts -- why should
timekeepers and judges continue to turn out for nothing, as they have
traditionally done? You must look elsewhere for the original motivation,
to the harriers perhaps.
In English football the Premiership is already virtually self-standing
to the extent that it is about to try to annexe one of the three
divisions which it graciously left to the Football League.
It makes its own rules about admission and its own agreements on TV
and whoever does that is king. In any club versus country situation it
will by definition favour the former, as will the Test &amp; County Cricket
Board if Ray Illingworth gets his way.
And yet I think the businessmen and the accountants will lose. The
office people will lose because they do not see that the great
attraction of professional sport is unpredictability. The winner has got
to change. Where it does not you have one club, admirably run, with
''house full'' notices every week and nine others who have spent the
summer in a state of almost total abstention from the transfer market.
In the long run there are only two certainties; water will run
downhill and creditors will call in debts. The latter truth is our
salvation and the reason the governing bodies will govern again, though
not exactly as they do now. There is not a rugby club in Scotland that
could draw 5000 every week but those who get even halfway there will
have players who will expect to be paid. In the long term they cannot
be.
Nor will the public be duped in perpetuity but contests between groups
with no sense of history or pride of posterity. Having attained his
broadcasting goals Kerry Packer dropped his cricketing Gaggle A versus
Gaggle B nonsenses like a shot. He would have done the same with rugby
had he succeeded. The robber barons bring chaos.
Probably shinty still survives as the last resort of the Simon Pures.
But, even as I write a car is Tighnabruaich-bound snaking in from
Ormidale. A foreign gentleman speaks: ''The plan, Mr Secretary, is for a
European league with Kyles Athletic, Andorra Camanachd, Lichtenstein
Lorne and five other clubs to play home and away. I am empowered to talk
in terms of #20,000 a man . . .''

<TEXT>
PLANS to establish Britain's first privately-run NHS hospital were
condemned yesterday as an ''easy descent into Hell''.
A top healthcare expert said the tendering of clinical services at a
proposed new hospital would be the start of a slippery slope towards
full NHS privatisation.
The criticism follows the Government's decision to introduce
competitive tendering for clinical services for the first time at a
planned new hospital at Stonehaven, near Aberdeen.
The proposals were part of a piecemeal approach designed to bring
about, step-by-step, a fully-privatised health service, said Emeritus
Professor Arnold Klopper.
Professor Klopper retired in 1987 after a lifetime of work for the NHS
in Grampian.
''If privatisation is allowed to gain a toehold in the NHS in
Stonehaven, it is inevitable that the Tories will push for more. Where
will it end?'' he asked.
Grampian Health Board's preferred option for future healthcare
provision in the Deeside town is to sell Woodcot Hospital, a former poor
house, and construct a new building on the site of existing Arduthie
Hospital.
While it appears to be generally agreed that new hospital facilities
are needed in the area, by offering the day-to-day running to the
private sector, Professor Klopper argued, standards of care would
inevitably drop.
''The concern is that the private contractor has got somehow to make a
profit out of the multi-million pound exercise of building that
hospital,'' he said.
''A business will always be looking for the ways to make money first
and foremost and not ways to provide first-class healthcare. It's as
simple as that.''
Professor Klopper was speaking at the launch, in Aberdeen, of a new
Scottish Labour Party pamphlet in its campaign against NHS
privatisation.
Labour's Scottish health spokesman, Mr John McAllion, said the
pamphlet, Healthcare USA: The American experience of healthcare market
madness, revealed the ''nightmare of market-driven health services''.
''This pamphlet details the nightmarish system of healthcare in the
USA. It points out the dangers of relying on market forces where, if you
cannot pay, then you do not get access to the best medical care
available.''
Mr McAllion claimed the Stonehaven scheme was a further step towards
the two-tier health system already in operation in the US.
''This is a situation which is already happening to millions of people
across America. The Tories have already started down that road. The NHS
internal market is already up and running.''
Mr McAllion said the Labour Party remained resolutely opposed to
anything which might threaten free and nationally-available healthcare.
''This Government's approach has always been to push back the bounds
step by step, so the changes are not obvious. I would not put it beyond
belief that the future free provision of health services is under
threat.''

Larnaca
THE boyfriend of a Danish tour guide bludgeoned to death in Cyprus
last year had to be wakened by police today to give evidence against
three British soldiers charged with killing her.
Bleary-eyed Michalis Vassiliades, 22, a Cypriot waiter, turned up at
the Cyprus Assizes Court here 80 minutes late saying he had been working
until the early hours and a friend forgot to wake him.
Vassiliades, who works at a bar in the coastal resort of Ayia Napa,
was hauled out of bed by police sent to his apartment when the minutes
ticked by at the court and he did not appear.
''What? So if you work that means you won't come?'' Judge Takis
Eliades asked angrily.
''OK, I won't go then tonight,'' said the witness, who starts work in
the evenings at 6pm and works until 5am.
''It is with great hesitation that the court has decided not to impose
any penalty on the witness arriving with great delay,'' said the judge.
Vassiliades has alleged that soldiers Alan Ford, 26, Justin Fowler,
27, and Jeff Pernell, 23, serving at a British base in Cyprus, abducted
Louise Jensen, 23, after knocking them both off their motorcycle on the
outskirts of Ayia Napa last September.
The defendants have pleaded not guilty to abduction, conspiracy to
rape and manslaughter. The woman's body was discovered in a shallow
roadside grave two days after she disappeared.
The soldiers, said by previous witnesses to be staggering drunk, were
arrested at a police roadblock after Vassiliades raised the alarm. They
were wearing bloodstained clothes.
Ford's lawyer accused Vassiliades of making up his testimony on the
incidents surrounding Jensen's disappearance.--Reuter.

Bangkok
A THAI judge is expected to deliver his judgment tomorrow on two
Britons charged with smuggling heroin.
Robert Lock, 30, from Cambridge, and Sandra Gregory, 29, from Sowerby
Bridge, west Yorkshire, are due to appear before a court in Bangkok in
the afternoon.
Both were arrested at Bangkok international airport in February 1993,
shortly before they were about to board a flight to Japan.
Gregory was found with 3.6 ounces of heroin in her possession.
Lock has denied smuggling. Gregory has pleaded guilty to heroin
possession, but not trafficking.
The Foreign Office said today it was likely the judge would deliver
his verdicts at tomorrow's hearing.
''The judge has suggested he has heard enough evidence. This may be
the final hearing,'' said a spokesman.
However, the pair might not be sentenced until a later date.
At a previous hearing, Lock claimed that he was innocent and accused
the Thai police of pressuring Gregory into testifying against him.
Gregory, meanwhile, told the court that Lock had paid her to act as a
''mule'' and carry the heroin for him.
Gregory said she was driven to smuggling by desperation over a
tropical illness she had contracted in Thailand.
She said she was suffering from dengue fever when she met Lock in late
1992. Gregory said Lock later told her he could help her get enough
money to cover medical expenses in London, after doctors advised her to
return home for treatment.
Heroin trafficking carries the death penalty in Thailand but the
sentence is invariably commuted to lengthy prison terms of at least 20
years.--PA.

Amman
TWO sons-in-law of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, including the
powerful industry minister, have left Iraq with their families after
differences in the ruling circle, a senior Jordanian source said today.
The source, who asked not to be identified, said Lieutenant General
Hussein Kamel Hassan, heading military industrialisation as well as the
industry and minerals ministry, left yesterday along with his brother,
Lieutenant-Colonel Saddam Kamel Hassan, who is in charge of Saddam's
guards. They are married to daughters of Saddam.
There was no independent confirmation of the report.
The source said there had been differences with Saddam, adding that
his information came from persons in contact with the Iraqi minister,
possibly the second most powerful man in Iraq.
''He has started contacting Iraqis in and out of Iraq to try to work
together to end the suffering of the Iraqi people and formulate an Iraqi
programme that guarantees radical change to the situation in Iraq,'' he
said.
Diplomats have long maintained that any serious threat to Saddam's
quarter-century in power would have to come from those close to him
because intense security measures make popular unrest difficult.
In addition to the two sons-in-law of Saddam, a cousin of the two men,
Major Izzedine Mohammed Hassan, had left, he said. They were accompanied
by their families and aides.
The source would not say where the men and their families were now but
Iraqi officials -- unable to fly out because of UN economic sanctions --
normally leave Iraq through Jordan.
The industry minister had been in Amman last month -- his first
foreign trip in about a year -- and diplomats said he appeared relaxed
and confident at the time.
He has held a series of key positions under Saddam. He was an army
commander in the 1980-88 war with Iran, built up special military units,
oversaw military industrialisation and directed the rebuilding of the
country's infrastructure since the devastation of the 1991 Gulf
war.--Reuter.

DISABLED workers and their employers would lose out if rumoured
Government proposals to scrap or change its Access to Work scheme go
through, warns the TUC, in a strong defence of the scheme.
Access to Work subsidises disabled workers and their employers when
they need changes in the workplace, special equipment or help with fares
to work.
In 1994-5, it helped 9000 disabled workers get or keep jobs, at a cost
of less than #15m compared with the #23.5m cost if these disabled people
had to rely on incapacity benefit.
The scheme, which came into effect in 1994, is undergoing a review in
the light of the new Disability Discrimination Bill, and the TUC fears
the Government will abolish it altogether, transfer much of the cost to
employers, or limit the scheme to those adjustments employers are not
required to make by the new Bill.
The TUC argues that if the Government shifts half the cost to
employers, some would be deterred from taking on disabled workers and
the effect would be to undermine the new Bill, as would limiting the
scheme.
At the same time, the TUC is seeking the removal of the upper limit of
#21,000 over five years which, its stresses, discriminates against the
most severely disabled.

Johannesburg,
ACTOR Hugh Grant's girlfriend Liz Hurley arrived in South Africa's Sun
City today to start work on a film about a stripper -- and said she was
relieved to have escaped the tabloid newspapers back home in Britain.
''It's always nice to be at work,'' she said when asked about the
press hounding she has endured since her boyfriend was arrested on
Hollywood Boulevard with a prostitute who said they were having oral
sex.
Hurley, 29, said she did not know if Grant would join her while the
film is shot during the next eight weeks.
But she told a news conference at the luxury resort 90 miles from
Johannesburg that she hoped to stay on afterwards and tour South Africa.
Grant was arrested last month in his car with 23-year-old prostitute
Divine Brown. She later denied a charge of lewd conduct and faces a
pre-trial hearing on August 18 in Los Angeles
He pleaded no contest to the same charge and was fined and placed on
probation.
In South Africa today Hurley said playing a stripper in the film did
not bother her or risk damaging her public image as the face of cosmetic
company Estee Lauder.
''To be quite honest most people have enough sense to make a
distinction between a movie and reality,'' she said.
The film -- unofficially titled The Spear -- is the story of an exile
returning to a crime-ridden South Africa to find his brother who has
double-crossed a drug cartel.
Hurley plays the missing man's girlfriend who teams up with his
brother, played by rap artist Ice Cube, on his search. The film is
directed by South African film-maker Darrell Roodt.
Asked by reporters whether she would be posing for the men's magazine
Playboy in South Africa, she said: ''If that's what you've heard, I'm
afraid you are very much misinformed.''
* Divine Brown's sudden fame after her arrest with Grant will last a
little longer. She has taped a TV commercial promoting the radio station
she claims the pair were listening to during their encounter in his
car.--Reuter.

ISRAELI Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said today he and PLO head

Palestinian self-rule later in the day.
Meanwhile, the Israeli army announced it would impose a closure on the
Gaza Strip Palestinian self-rule enclave from 1am tomorrow until Friday,
barring nearly one million Arabs in Gaza from Israel.
Israeli security sources speculated the closure may have been imposed
out of fears the prospect of a West Bank deal could spur attacks by
Palestinian guerrillas opposed to peace moves.
The last Islamic militant suicide bombing, in a Tel Aviv suburb,
killed six Israelis. It occurred on July 24, the day before Israel and
the PLO had hoped to sign a West Bank deal.
Peres flew to Jerusalem from the Egyptian resort of Taba to consult
with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Arafat was consulting with his aides
in Taba.
''The picture is not completed. We (the Israeli team) are now flying
to Jerusalem for an urgent consultation with our own government and our
own prime minister,'' Peres said.
He said the Israeli team was due to return to Taba. On arrival in
Jerusalem, Peres went straight to Rabin's office.
Arafat made no comment to reporters at Taba where the two men have
been meeting for the last three days to clinch an accord on Palestinian
elections and an Israeli troop redeployment away from Arab West Bank
population centres that is more than a year late.
Arafat spokesman Marwan Kanafani said: ''If progress is achieved the
negotiating teams would be instructed to finalise drafting an agreement
and then submit it to the leaderships.''
A PLO official, speaking during the recess on condition he not be
named, said there could be an initialling of an agreement in Taba but a
signing would be later.
The leaders must reach an accord on security arrangements in rural
areas, the fate of the town of Hebron and water rights.
Kanafani said Peres and Arafat telephoned Rabin. He did not elaborate
but added: ''We have a crisis on some issues that might delay the whole
process, especially Hebron. We hope Mr Peres will return with flexible
and positive attitudes.''
The agreement being worked out calls for an Israeli pull-out from Arab
population centres before Palestinian elections and further redeployment
from other areas after the poll.
But Israel does not want to leave Hebron, the only Arab town with
Jewish settlers living inside it. Palestinians want them out of Hebron
except for where the settlers live.
The issue of settlements is due to be negotiated in 1996.
Israel Radio said the trade-off that might be under consideration
would be more Israeli flexibility on transfer of civil powers for
Palestinian concessions on security.
Peres said as he left: ''The whole time our central problem was not to
move on security.''
On Tuesday, Arafat and Peres agreed that Israeli troops will redeploy
in three stages after the poll with six-month intervals instead of
three-month intervals as the PLO originally demanded.
Arafat's main opposition group, the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas,
criticised Arafat's agreement to a phased Israeli withdrawal as
''astonishing concessions''.
The talks are being held in the shadow of rising protests by Jewish
settlers opposed to the expansion of Palestinian rule. Many of the
100,000 Jews living among some one million Arabs in the West Bank oppose
the Israeli-PLO peace talks.

POLICE are treating as suspicious the death of a second Glasgow
prostitute within two months.
However, they are not making any link between the death on Monday
night of Ms Marjorie Roberts, 34, and the killing in June of 22-year-old
prostitute Leona McGovern, who was battered to death less than half a
mile away.
Shortly before eight o'clock on Monday evening, Ms Roberts's body was
pulled from the River Clyde near Jamaica Bridge by Mr George Parsonage
of the Glasgow Humane Society.
Police sealed off the scene while forensic teams scoured the area for
clues.
A post-mortem examination was carried out yesterday afternoon. A
police spokesman said Ms Roberts's death was still being treated as
suspicious but at this stage was not being considered a murder.
There was also nothing to suggest a link with the death of Ms
McGovern, whose body was found in the grounds of the Glasgow Arts Centre
in Washington Street in June -- a third of a mile from where Ms
Roberts's body was found.
Last month, murder squad detectives began rounding up prostitutes in
Glasgow's red light district.
They launched a crackdown on the women who they thought may be
shielding a killer but got no response from the prostitutes who work the
Anderston area.
Murder squad detectives have boosted the ranks of the vice squad team
who police the area.
The officer in charge of the murder inquiry, DCI Nanette Pollock, has
now been drafted into the new death investigation.
A report into Ms Roberts's death will be submitted to the
procurator-fiscal.

Washington
AMERICAN airports and airlines were tightening security today
following an order by federal authorities concerned about possible
terror attacks against the United States.
US Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said in a statement that no
specific threats have been made but ''it is prudent to ensure that these
additional measures are in place to prevent or deter possible criminal
or terrorist acts''.
It was the first nationwide security alert since the 1991 Gulf War,
Transportation Department spokesman Bill Mosley said. The State
Department suggested the alert was related to fears of domestic attacks,
rather than foreign extremists.
''It is not an international issue from our point of view,'' David
Johnson, a department spokesman, told reporters. The department is
involved in efforts to thwart attacks against US targets by overseas
groups.
Transportation Department officials declined to discuss the reasons
behind the heightened security alert, but Pena said it was based on
information provided by federal law enforcement and intelligence
agencies.
The Washington Post today listed Pope John Paul's visit to the United
States in October as a possible focus for the alert.
Air Transport Association spokesman Chris Chiames said there was no
reason for passengers to panic and expressed concern that the Federal
Aviation Administration directive being distributed to airports,
airlines and federal security forces might needlessly scare travelers.
''No specific threat against US airlines or US airports has been
communicated to the industry through the FAA,'' Chiames told a news
conference..--Reuter.

LABOUR MP Henry McLeish yesterday accused Railtrack, the central
monopoly in the proposed privatised rail system, of systematically using
its position to levy excessive charges on other parts of the former
British Rail.
Mr McLeish, the Shadow Transport Minister, said the levies made
Railtrack a more attractive prospect for privatisation.
He claimed that Railtrack's charges put the future of a number of new
lines and stations in doubt and said the Secretary of State should
ensure Railtrack was not permitted to jeopardise these schemes.
The Secretary of State should also investigate the additional cost to
the taxpayer of the Railtrack price structure for projects, he said.
If Railtrack were a local authority, he said, it would likely now be
the subject of an investigation by the National Audit Office or the
House of Commons Public Accounts Committee as a result of its recent
conduct.
There was an urgent need, Mr McLeish said, for the rail regulator
either to investigate Railtrack's project-pricing structure or to accept
that the regulator could not deal with the issue and refer the matter to
the National Audit Office or the Public Accounts Committee.
Mr McLeish said the cost of privatising the railway system was already
about #1000m. This was money which had been taken from the UK taxpayer
to pursue a political programme of no demonstrable benefit to the rail
system and no obvious use to the rail user.
However, a further cost would be the stations that would not be built,
the lines that would not reopen, and the improvements to services that
passengers would be denied.
Mr McLeish said the train-operating companies and the passenger
transport executives were key parts of the railway.
''The charging of excessive costs by Railtrack to these and similar
rail companies means that the UK taxpayer is being forced to hand over
the cash which Railtrack is now attempting to bleed from the rail
system.
''Why should the taxpayer subsidise Railtrack's profiteering and
preparation for flotation?''
Mr McLeish said the Conservative Government was determined to wreck
the hard work of ordinary people trying to improve their communities.
Railtrack charged employee costs to any scheme and was determined to
charge for all aspects of station design.
''The truth is that Railtrack is not interested in the future of the
railway, only in its bottom line,'' he said.
Among examples of Railtrack cost inflation given by Mr McLeish were
the following park and ride schemes in Strathclyde:
Ayr Kyle Street Station, initial cost #150,000, current cost #225,000;
Airdrie Station, initial #110,000, current #214,000; Bishopton Station,
initial #120,000, current #198,000; Croy Station, initial #150,000,
current #215,000.

Nagasaki
NAGASAKI today remembered the atomic bombing of the city with prayers
for those who died 50 years ago and a call to abolish nuclear weapons
for the sake of future generations.
As Nagasaki mourned the victims of the attack, Japanese leaders
criticised China and France for their nuclear weapons plans and
demonstrators scuffled with police outside the French embassy in Tokyo.
At 11.02am, the time a B-29 bomber dropped the ''Fat Man'' bomb on
August 9, 1945, 30,000 people began a one-minute prayer in Nagasaki's
Peace Park, as church and Buddhist temple bells rang and emergency
sirens blared.
The scene was dominated by a peace statue, a huge image of a
half-naked man with his right arm pointing skyward and his left
stretching forward in a gesture of peace.
Survivors of the bombing and bereaved families of victims offered
water at an altar, symbolising their wish to quench the thirst of those
who died crying for water.
''Has the message of Nagasaki reached the ears of the world?''
Nagasaki Mayor Iccho Ito asked at the ceremony.
''There is still a high wall standing between the aspirations of the
citizens of Nagasaki and the insistence of the nuclear states on the
concept of nuclear deterrence or security through the possession of
nuclear weapons,'' he said.
He delivered a peace declaration that demanded nuclear weapons be
abolished and nuclear tests abandoned, and said that if Japan did not
apologise to Asian nations it invaded during the Second World War, its
anti-nuclear message would not be received.
China's nuclear tests in May, and France's decision to resume test
blasts in September in the South Pacific have drawn condemnation in
Japan and throughout the Pacific.
In Tokyo, about 50 demonstrators, some wearing masks of President
Jacques Chirac, surrounded the French embassy as they protested against
his decision to resume tests.
The Nagasaki bomb killed about 74,000 of the city's 240,000 people
instantly or soon after with heat and radiation.
People are still dying from its after-effects, and a list of 3073 more
who died this year from bomb-related illness was presented at the
memorial, bringing the total to 105,348.
The attack came just three days after the world's first atomic bomb
flattened Hiroshima on August 6, 1945.

Washington
SPEAKER Newt Gingrich is in trouble. Vanity Fair magazine alleges that
the Speaker of the House had a series of sleazy affairs with various
women in the mid-1970s, when he was married to his first wife.
That was the lady who was in hospital, recovering from a cancer
operation, when Gingrich walked into her room to tell her he wanted a
divorce.
The article quotes a woman, Anne Manning, who was herself married at
the time, describing a sexual encounter with Mr Gingrich in 1977.
He allegedly took her to a hotel room. ''We had oral sex,'' she said.
''He prefers that modus operandi because then he can say 'I never slept
with her.'''
The magazine reports that Mrs Manning made the allegations about Mr
Gingrich now out of dislike for his position on family values.
The speaker, like other prominent divorced Republicans, is a great
believer in the sanctity of marriage.
She said: ''I don't claim to be an angel. He's morally dishonest. He
has gone too far believing that 'I'm beyond the law.' He should be
stopped before it's too late.''
The magazine also reported that Mr Gingrich had a number of other
affairs during the same period.
This is all too reminiscent of allegations made against President
Clinton over the past two years.
In a spirit of equal-opportunity sleaziness, the New York Post, owned
by Rupert Murdoch, gives the Gingrich story the same front-page
treatment it gave the saga of Bill Clinton and Paula Jones, while the
Washington Post and New York Times ignore it altogether.

Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia
CROATIAN Serbs arriving in Serbia said today they feared a dismal
future in an impoverished country swollen with refugees.
After the initial relief of escaping war and reaching safety in
Serbia, and though grateful for the emergency aid they have received,
many of the refugees are beginning to worry how they will feed their
families and where they will settle.
At a refugee camp overflowing with Krajina Serbs, one man said he
planned to take his family to relatives in Vrsac where his grandmother's
sister would try to help them make a new start.
But his relations lived on a meagre pension in a crammed flat. ''We
can't stay with them. We're not even expecting them to take us. It's
just temporary,'' said Dragan.
Stunned by the swift collapse of the Krajina region to Croatian
forces, Dragan and other refugees said Serbian authorities had a duty to
provide for them.
''It's up to the state. We don't have money. We have no work. They
have to take care of us,'' said Dragan, who fled Krajina in a truck with
12 relatives, including four children.
Local Red Cross workers said they were managing to provide food, water
and medicine to those pouring over the Serbian border.
But the tidal wave of refugees could further strain the country's
feeble economy and poses a potential political threat to Serbian
president Slobodan Milosevic whose opponents are keen to exploit the
plight of Krajina Serbs who feel betrayed by Belgrade.
The Yugoslav Red Cross warned yesterday that the 150,000 refugees
expected at Serbia's border could not settle permanently in Serbia. The
authorities have opened new border crossings to absorb the influx.
In an omninous sign, some refugees said Croats and non-Serbs living in
Serbia should be expelled from their homes to make room for the Krajina
Serbs.
This small town near the Serbian border has been transformed into a
tent city teeming with refugees, who have turned their tractors, trucks
and cars into temporary shelters.
Tractors hauling trailers piled high with belongings line the streets.
Refugees sleep under their vehicles to escape the blazing summer heat.
Women wash laundry in buckets and hang clothes out to dry on nearby
trees.
The local Serbs in Mitrovica said they were shocked at the influx of
refugees and some were trying to provide what assistance they could.
Borka Romandic, a shop assistant at a market, was clearly moved by the
spectacle unfolding in front of her.
''Three years ago I put up three children and their parents who were
refugees. And I would do it again,'' she said. ''When I see those
children, how can I just stand aside? I have to do something.''
Many Krajina Serbs, who fled a heavy Croat bombardment last Friday,
had left only with the clothes on their backs.
At a small shop in Mitrovica, a Krajina Serb soldier asked for
toothpaste. But he turned away, mumbling to himself: ''What am I doing?
What do I need toothpaste for? I don't even have a
toothbrush.''--Reuter.

Bihac, Bosnia,
HE IS only four years old, but Aladin Hodzic strides forward on his
crutches with the solemn air of a veteran soldier. The little Muslim boy
lost his right leg a year ago to a shell in the Serb siege of Bihac.
Now with the siege lifted by the Croatian victory in Krajina, he will
be able to get the medical help he needs and Aladin's father Abdulah is
making plans to give his child the normal future he craves.
''My first concern is to take care of his health,'' Mr Hodzic said,
strolling at his son's slow pace through a once-pretty town pocked by
shells and lined with sandbags.
''Now the road is open, I'll be able to take him to Zagreb to get a
first false leg fitted. That one alone is going to cost 1500 German
marks (#680), and he's so small I've been told he'll need 17 different
false legs before he grows up.''
The people of Bihac have been unable to leave their homes on the
border with Croatia since June 1992, when Serbs from both Croatia and
enemy areas of Bosnia launched fierce attacks on the town and closed the
roads.
Bosnian Serbs attacking Bihac from the hills have now been overwhelmed
by thousands of Serb refugees fleeing the Krajina region.
So Mr Hodzic, now a soldier but before the war a musician who played
the trumpet, guitar and piano accordion, made his crippled son a pair of
adjustable crutches himself.
As Aladin grows, detachable pins at the bottom can be screwed into
different holes bored through the wood of the curved crutches,
stretching them an inch at a time.
''There are at least 180 children here with amputated limbs and other
very serious injuries,'' Mr Hodzic said. Until last week, they had to
fend for themselves as best they could.
Fear and a terrible isolation have tormented the parents of Bihac for
three years, but children born under siege knew no other existence than
the boom of shells, the shattering of masonry, the wail of sirens and
perpetual semi-starvation.
''Nothing has changed yet. We haven't got any food supplies in town
yet. But we're beginning to feel freedom. Now we can at least tell the
children that they will have more than they had before,'' said smiling
35-year-old Jasna Lipovaca.
''All our best food went to the children . . . but a single
poor-quality chocolate cost five marks (#2.30).
''The younger children don't even know what a banana or an orange
is,'' she added.
Children thronged the streets at their parents' sides, most thin and
undersized for their age, their pinched faces contrasting sharply with
their parents' joyful expressions.
Shy little Edina Alidzic would not answer questions or meet the eye of
strangers talking to her.
''Why don't you tell them that what you want most is for your father
to come back?'' her mother prompted gently. Edina's father went away to
fight four years ago, when the youngest child in the family was only
five months old.
He has never come back, but his wife found out four months ago that he
was still alive. ''I just hope there will be a breakthrough now and he
will come,'' she said, tears glistening behind eyes, newly made-up to
mark the lifting of the siege. --Reuter.

Zagreb
AS ROUTED rebel Serb fighters handed in their heavy weapons to
peacekeepers today, the UN raised the first accusations of atrocities
against civilians in Krajina.
A UN spokeswoman said that, according to an eyewitness account, a
group of five old people, some mentally handicapped and one in a
wheelchair, were shot dead by soldiers wearing uniforms bearing Bosnian
army insignia.
The statement came as the UN-brokered peace deal saw an end to most of
the fighting in Croatia and paved the way for a further exodus of
exhausted refugees to Serbia.
UN spokeswoman Leah Melnick said the atrocities had been witnessed by
a member of the Danish peacekeeping contingent during fighting yesterday
at the border town of Dvor.
''They were shot at point blank range,'' she said. ''Clearly one man
was helpless. They were all elderly.
''The person in the wheelchair was completely helpless and it would
seem, given their age and the possibility that some were mentally
handicapped, that these people would have been helpless to defend
themselves.
''The UN totally condemns this as a crime against humanity.''
But Ms Melnick said the UN had not positively identified the killers
-- whether they might have been Bosnian army regular troops or possibly
irregulars.
The killers were reported to be wearing the insignia of a red shield
and a yellow V, the Roman numeral used by the Bosnian army 5th Corps
based in nearby Bihac. The UN has confirmed that Bosnian 5th Corps
troops have been in the area inside Croatia, fighting with their Croat
allies.
Fighting around Dvor subsided and Serb fighters cornered after
Croatia's victory surrendered to the UN, clearing the way for about
80,000 refugees still trapped in Croatia to flee to Serbia.
UN officials said the first column of refugees in five buses and 200
private vehicles escorted by UN police set out on the journey to Serbia
after the weapons were given up.
''They are exhausted, traumatised, dehydrated, hungry and urgently in
need of humanitarian help,'' UN spokesman Chris Gunness told reporters
in Belgrade.
In the former front-line town of Sisak, enraged mobs of Croats pelted
exhausted Serb refugees with bricks and chunks of concrete as police
stood by, some laughing. Several hundred people crowded in on a convoy
of about 400 cars on the south side of the town, which lies 25 miles
south-east of Zagreb.
Croat children, some as young as eight years old, threw bricks
directly through car windows at refugees. Not a car escaped unscathed,
and blood streamed down the faces of dozens of people inside.
One woman, her head bloodied, cringed in a car, trying to protect a
small baby from flying glass and bricks.
Nica Melikovic, 34, approached one car whose door already had been
ripped off. He grabbed the shoulder of the driver and spat in his face.
''That's what I think of you!'' he said.
Later, as the convoy temporarily halted, men and boys dragged Serb men
out and beat them. One man was repeatedly hit in the face, stomach and
genitals before police intervened and he was driven off in an ambulance,
dripping blood.
Another man repeatedly thrust a big rock through car windshields,
breaking them. He held back when he came upon a car with Orthodox nuns,
but the crowd taunted him and then pelted the car with stones and
bricks. At least one nun was hit.
The latest outpouring of refugees hope to join a vast migration
jamming the roads across northern Serb-held Bosnia en route to Serbia.
People in cars, tractors and on horse-drawn carts fanned out along
roads through northern Serb-held Bosnia on the slow journey from their
abandoned homes in Croatia towards the hope of shelter. UN aid officials
said 50,000 people had already crossed into Serbia.
But despite the lull in fighting, peace in former Yugoslavia still
seemed remote, with Serbia warning Croatia to stop its ''aggression'' or
face the consequences.
''Everything depends on Croatia,'' the Yugoslav foreign minister, Mr
Vladislav Jovanovic told Interfax news agency in Moscow.
''If it continues its aggression and threatens Yugoslavia's vital
state and national interests, then Yugoslavia will have no other choice
but to put a stop to Croatia's aggressive policies,'' he was quoted as
saying.
It was the strongest warning by rump Yugoslavia, which is dominated by
the republic of Serbia, since the Croatian army's victory.
The US hastily launched a peace initiative with President Clinton
despatching his National Security Adviser, Mr Anthony Lake, on a tour of
the capitals of the Contact Group on Yugoslavia whose members are
Britain, Germany, Russia, France and the US itself. He will not be
visiting Moscow.
But in Moscow Russian president Boris Yeltsin's peace proposals
suffered a body-blow when Croatian President Franjo Tudjman rebuffed his
invitation for talks with his Serbian counterpart, Mr Slobodan
Milosevic, in Moscow. However, Mr Milosevic did arrive later for talks.
The Croatian news agency HINA said Mr Tudjman believed Bosnian
president Alija Izetbegovic should have been invited as well. --

Washington
THE United States has evidence of a freshly-dug field near a United
Nations ''safe haven'' overrun by Bosnian Serbs, suggesting bodies could
have been bulldozed into a mass grave, officials said.
According to one official the evidence is an aerial photograph of the
field near Srebrenica, one of two so-called safe areas that Bosnian
Serbs overran last month.
The International Red Cross has said at least 6000 people are
unaccounted for since the capture of Srebrenica.
At the State Department in Washington, spokesman David Johnson said:
''We have some evidence from sensitive sources that tends to corroborate
accounts of atrocities against the men and boys who were detained in
Srebrenica.''
Mr Johnson said Washington's Ambassador to the UN, Madeleine Albright,
planned to present the evidence to the Security Council.
A Washington official who spoke to reporters anonymously said the US
had found disturbed earth ''that was consistent with a mass grave'' and
was gathering eyewitness accounts that might corroborate the existence
of such a grave.
He said there were estimates that up to 10,000 men and boys were
missing after the Serb takeover of Srebrenica but there was no way of
knowing how many were in hiding.
The official said the US evidence was an aerial photograph, indicating
it was taken by a spy plane. It shows a large, freshly-dug area about a
mile from Srebenica's football stadium.
Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck said after a trip to Bosnia
last week that he had heard credible eyewitness accounts that Serbs had
conducted mass executions of men and boys, mostly Muslims, and bulldozed
them into mass graves on the spot.
Mr Shattuck told a press conference that one man, who had a bullet
wound, told him of a mass execution of men and boys in a small stadium.
He said another man who had survived told him he had been on one of a
number of truckloads of 20 men at a time who were taken from a warehouse
and shot.
Another witness had told him that General Ratko Mladic had been
present at one mass execution and nearly all the refugees he spoke to
had told him Gen Mladic had been highly visible during the brutality
after Serb takeovers of both Srebrenica and Zepa last month.
Earlier today the Central Intelligence Agency said eyewitness accounts
of killings or detention of Muslims and other victims at Srebrenica and
Zepa were increasingly being corroborated. But the CIA's deputy director
for intelligence, John Gannon, would not say at a public Senate hearing
what corroboration the CIA had of recent atrocities.
Mr Gannon said the CIA had found a clear pattern of Bosnian Serb
''ethnic cleansing'' since 1992 and reports of torture, murder and rape
after Serbs overran Srebrenica and Zepa indicated the pattern was
continuing.
CIA analysis had shown more than 3000 settlements, mainly in
Serb-controlled areas of Bosnia, had been burned or destroyed in a
campaign of ethnic cleansing so that up to 90% of non-Serbs would have
no homes to return to.
* UN officials said in Sarajevo that Gen Mladic was the man they
called to get things done in Serb-held Bosnia, confirming that power is
ebbing away from civilian leader Dr Radovan Karadzic.
''We talk to Mladic, no matter whether it's utilities for Sarajevo,
convoys, access to prisoners of war or issues pertaining to the

''We never used to do this. We used to talk to the civilian

BOTH Russia and the United States have launched competing bids to
revive peace efforts in former Yugoslavia. But it remains to be seen
whether the major powers can overcome disagreements which have crippled
them until now.
Diplomats agree that Croatia's lightning victory has transformed the
picture and some countries, particularly the US and Germany, believe it
opens new opportunities for peace efforts.
But there is no hard evidence that the five-nation Contact Group will
be able to agree on the next step, despite a flurry of top-level
consultations between the members -- Russia, the US, Germany, France and
Britain.
Russia, which has more sympathy with the Serbs and is suspicious of
Western involvement in the Balkans, has launched its peace initiative by
seeking to draw Croatia's President Tudjman and his Serbian counterpart,
Mr Slobodan Milosevic, to Moscow for peace talks.
That initiative looked to be dead in the water yesterday after the
Croatian president refused to attend.
The US, which pointedly made no public comment about the Russian
invitation, announced yesterday that it was launching its own initiative
by sending a high-level delegation led by President Clinton's National
Securioty Adviser Mr Anthony Lake, to London, Paris and Bonn for talks
this week.
''It looks awfully like competition and we've had no real indication
that either the Russians or Americans have anything of real substance to
put on the table,'' said one European diplomat.
Desperate to end a war which has soured their relations and undermined
their authority, the major powers want the defiant Bosnian Serbs to
accept a peace plan that would divide Bosnia roughly evenly between a
Muslim-Croat federation and the rebel Serbs.
But Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has shown no inclination to
accept the plan. In fact, he and the defeated Krajina Serb leader Milan
Martic yesterday announced a counter-offensive to retake the lost
Croatian territories and to attack Croatian towns including the capital
Zagreb.
But without the help of President Milosevic and his powerful army that
seems unlikely.
Western hopes are now pinned on Dr Karadzic losing a power struggle
with his military commander, General Ratko Mladic, who has close ties
with Belgrade. Mr Milosevic might then persuade Gen Mladic to accept the
peace plan.
The Bosnian Muslims fear rumours of a carve-up in the Balkans between
Serbia and Croatia. These were fanned by reports in British newspapers
this week featuring a map scribbled by President Tudjman for Paddy
Ashdown, leader of Britain's Liberal Democrats, on the back of a menu at
a formal dinner in London in May.
It showed Bosnia cut in two, but Zagreb's ambassador to Britain, Mr
Ante Sicin-Sain, has denied that there is any such agreement. --

LABOUR must intervene and halt bitter in-fighting for nominations in
two new parliamentary constituencies on the south side of Glasgow, a
councillor demanded yesterday.
Boundary Commission changes will reduce the number of Glasgow MPs from
11 to 10, with new constituencies being created at Pollok and Govan.
This has produced an unseemly scramble for the parliamentary
nominations for the two new constituencies involving three sitting MPs,
Mr Mike Watson (Central), Mr Ian Davidson (Govan), Mr James Dunnachie
(Pollok), and a millionaire businessman and councillor, Mr Mohammed
Sarwar.
Allegations of dirty tricks campaigns and shady dealings have been
legion.
Last night, Mr Gordon Archer, 28, a newly-elected member of the City
of Glasgow Council and a supporter of Mr Sarwar, complained that the
situation was ''out of hand''.
He said: ''The Labour Party has to act to sort this out. That means
that, if Tony Blair is serious about a new modern Labour Party, then he
has to come down on all parties concerned and stop talking to the press
and get on with the job in hand and stop insulting voters with this
ridiculous rumour-mongering.''
In his view the party was taking substantial damage because people
were using the media to settle scores.
''People should be more responsible,'' he urged.
His comments came as Mr Dunnachie angrily dismissed reports that he
was at the centre of an investigation into how he uses the #43,000
allowance he gets from Parliament for funding a constituency office and
research and secretarial staff.
Mr Dunnachie said yesterday: ''It's a lot of rubbish. I do employ
people.
''There is nothing for me to answer. I notify the fees office about
who works for me and they pay them and that's it.''
It is understood the new constituency Labour Parties of Pollok and
Govan are writing to the MPs asking what facilities they have and what
they can make available to the new constituencies.
Mr Davidson commented: ''I'm very happy that the constituency Labour
Parties are asking me and other MPs to explain what we do with funds
Parliament gives us to run an office.
''I can tell them the address of my office and I can give them the
names of all my staff and I can let them see all the equipment that
Parliament has bought and paid for to enable me to serve my
constituents.
''I have nothing to hide. I do not believe anybody should shirk such
an investigation.''
* Tory Party chairman Brian Mawhinney is planning a summer campaign to
expose Labour's ''loony left'' councils across Britain after an early
publicity coup at Walsall.
While Mr Blair is relaxing on holiday in Italy, Dr Mawhinney will be
on the warpath taking aim at Labour's town hall record.
Dr Mawhinney claimed victory at Walsall after Labour announced it was
suspending the district party on Tuesday, the very day he arrived in
town to attack the council's ''loony left'' activities.
Yesterday, Walsall council's acting leader angrily demanded that
Labour chiefs lift the ''ill-judged'' suspension of his district party.

VISITORS to the Isle of May this month can learn about life as it was
lived there in the twelfth century.
The island in the Firth of Forth is one of the earliest Christian
settlements in Scotland. Its twelfth-century priory has been under
excavation for four years.
Now, for the first time in 500 years, most of the remains of the
priory are visible.
Fife Regional Council's archaeological officer, Mr Peter Yeoman, said
they wanted to encourage people to take an interest.
An exhibition telling the story of the excavations has been mounted in
the Scottish Fisheries Museum in Anstruther, the sailing departure point
for the island.

PROTESTERS celebrated a victory against ''condom culture'' when
Highland regional councillors ruled out the installation of condom
machines in secondary schools.
A lobby of more than 50, dominated by Free Church ministers and
members who stood shoulder to shoulder with Catholics, gathered outside
the council headquarters in Inverness.
They carried no placards and opted for a quiet protest, recognising
that councillors were already aware of their strong opposition to the
results of a survey of Highland parents which showed the majority wanted
condoms to be available in schools.
The survey by Highland Regional Council and Highland Health Board
showed most parents believed condom machines should be sited in senior
pupils' toilets, as well as in community centres or village hall
toilets.
Depute director of education Jack Findlay subsequently prepared a
report on the survey's findings but recommended machines should not be
installed in schools, fearing the implication that the authority was
condoning, if not encouraging, under-age sex.
He added: ''Secondary heads who have been consulted are strongly
opposed to any such move, foreseeing the practical problems as well as
the moral issues.''
Both the regional council and the health board were anxious to
discover parental views on sex education. The overwhelming response was
that the fullest advice should be given on the facts of life, including
the role of condoms in reducing the risk of pregnancy and contracting
HIV.
The Highlands has one of the highest abortion rates in Britain.
However, the group who met Highland education chairwoman Val MacIver
before the committee made their decision wanted the council to emphasis
moral and religious issues, rather than sex education.
After a 90-minute debate, the committee decided unanimously not to
provide condom machines in schools but will continue to develop a
balanced health education programme.
Afterwards, the leader of the opposition lobby, the Rev Morris
Roberts, of Greyfriars Free Church of Scotland in Inverness, said: ''I
am very happy with the outcome. Sense and wisdom has prevailed.
''Sex education should ideally be left to parents. In this day and
age, they do not do enough. I am afraid if condom machines were to be
placed in schools, innocent children might be coerced into sexual
encounters.''
During the meeting, virtually all the councillors voiced their
disagreement with the parents' recommendation for condom machines.
Mr Ian MacDonald waved a bible at his fellow councillors and said:
''There is something very wrong with condom culture.''
Highland Health Board general manager, Dr Gordon Stone, attended the
meeting. He said afterwards: ''The board has never debated the question
of condom machines in schools but we were aware it was an issue
supported by parents. We decided to await the outcome of the education
committee and we will discuss it as a board in September.''

The colony -- of the Daubenton species -- remained undiscovered in St

''I got a call from the police at three o'clock in the morning saying
that the burglar alarm had gone off in the cathedral,'' said the Rev

''There was no evidence of anyone having broken in. It was only when
we noticed a strange movement that we realised it had been set off by

<HEADLINE>A river runs through it: paradise for anglers becomes war zone for poacher and gamekeeper. Big fish fight small fry for control</HEADLINE>

<EDITION>3</EDITION>

THE historic if uneasy truce between poacher and gamekeeper lies
shattered in one of Scotland's most outstanding areas of natural beauty
which contains some of the Highlands most renowned salmon interests.
So far, the only losers in an increasingly ugly war between locals and
the establishment in Kyle of Sutherland have been the fish.
All signs point not to a truce but a deepening of the crisis which
threatens more poison attacks on rivers in an area often described as a
paradise for anglers.
There are too many principles -- and money -- at stake in the area,
ironically known locally as the Millionaire's View because of the
spectacular scenery.
Diametrically opposed views have destroyed the peace and calm, with
generations of salmon -- whose life cycle is extraordinary -- wiped out
in one swift, cruel strike last month.
A tinful of Cymag poison emptied at Glencarvie Falls on the River
Carron destroyed some 1128 adult salmon and grilse returning home from
as far afield as Greenland and the Faroes.
They suffocated to death over a two-mile stretch starved of oxygen.
Tens of thousands of this year's salmon fry, parr, and smolts up to four
years old also died as lethal hydrogen cyanide gas was released on
contact with the river.
It's claimed anyone swimming in the affected stretch would also have
been killed.
Deep-rooted prejudices between rich and poor are at the heart of the
controversy, although envy also plays a part.
Locals have for centuries poached the four major salmon rivers which
converge into the Kyle at Bonar Bridge, but now they are being dogged by
bailiffs armed with night sights and even video cameras.
The poisoning was a brutal warning to the successful authorities to
back off -- or it will happen again, perhaps next time at the Shin
Falls, a major tourist attraction.
The reasoning behind the grotesque overkill is as simplistic as that,
despite fanciful speculation ranging from former estate employees with a
grudge to modern day vengeance for the Highland Clearances.
However, the clampdown on poachers -- and their brutal response -- has
coincided with heated debates on who owns Scotland, a loss of jobs
associated with salmon netting changes at Bonar Bridge, and growing
disillusionment at absentee landlords raking in cash from English or
foreign visitors on rivers priced way beyond locals' reach.
A failure to provide a fish ladder at Glencarvie Falls has also upset
some in the local community, which is just more than 1000-strong.
It is alleged salmon face disease and death from overcrowding if
unable to leap the falls in low water and reach spawning beds.
Two people with close links to the poaching fraternity in Kyle spoke
of community outrage at being deprived of fishing even at the estuary --
unless prepared to pay #15-a-day or #75-a-week. Upstream, in freshwater,
the charges soar into four figures.
The other side in the argument told of futile and foolhardy gestures
which could cost the local economy millions of pounds and destroy the
fishing for 30 years.
Mr Sandy Chalmers, whose cottage includes a 200ft frontage to tidal
water at Invershin, near Bonar Bridge, is among Sutherlanders who
believe in a fundamental right to take wild salmon, even if poached from
''private'' or ''controlled'' stretches.
He said: '' I maintain every local person has a right to get a salmon
out of the water. I have been doing that since 1971, and will continue
to do so until they lock me up or until I die.
''The Red Indians retained rights to fish even after being put on
reservations, and it is not as if we are mugging a granny.
''But since 1986 there have been draconian penalties and punishments
under amendments to a Salmon and Freshwater (Fisheries) Act made in
1868. These fish are a renewable resource, and there are thousands out
there.''
He added that the Carron poisoning, which he described as a horrendous
act which he could not condone, was a demonstration by unknowns whose
message to the anti-poacher authorities was clear: Enough is enough --
back off or suffer the consequences.
Mr Chalmers feared more attacks throughout the rivers system if the
warning was ignored. Poachers, he believed, were especially frustrated
by salmon fishing rights in the hands of a few people who charge #1000
or more per rod.
He said the equilibrium between poacher and establishment altered
three years ago. Ancient, accepted practices which had served both sides
became taboo, with a hardline regime backed by the full force of law
determined to prevent even the removal of one fish for the pot.
He ridiculed landowners' claims that a salmon caught legitimately by
visiting anglers was worth #1700 to the local economy, arguing that the
bulk of income went directly to the proprietors for the hire of lodges
and beats on estates.
Ghillies, cooks, and cleaners who serviced the anglers reputedly
received #150-a-week, excluding tips. Very few anglers even strayed from
holiday homes, perhaps only to buy a few beers, some petrol, or a meal.
Mr Charles Menzies, river superintendent for the Kyle of Sutherland
Fishery Board -- financed by the proprietors -- was adamant the
authorities will not bow to threats.
The Carron incident had only made bailiffs more determined. The
poisoning, he suspected, was only the irresponsible action of someone
who wanted revenge for successes in anti-poaching.
Mr Menzies knew of local poachers who took fish for profit as well as
the pot, plus organised gangs from Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Fife.
Despite slumps in salmon prices, due mainly to farmed fish, it was
still possible for unscrupulous individuals to make #1000-a-week selling
to the black market at #1 a pound.
The legitimate wild fish price was about #2.25 a pound, but the
problem of poached sales is such the board repeatedly issues leaflets to
hoteliers and others that possession of illegally taken salmon can lead
to fines of #2000 and imprisonment for three months.
It is hoped the fishery board's hatchery -- subjected to an attack in
1990, when creosote was put in water pipes -- will help the Carron
recover. Up to 2.5 million ova are stripped annually from stock and
grown on at secret locations. Fewer than five per cent are expected to
survive to go to sea then return as adults.
Mr Menzies, with a staff of ''more than seven'' covering over 70 miles
of river and loch in remote Sutherland, said: ''A lot of poachers are
scared off because they know we are there. We will update to protect the
waters, with more men and more equipment if necessary.''
In the last fortnight, seven warnings have been issued to anglers
fishing without permission or using illegal tactics. Last year, 48
warnings were issued, with four people charged. Two were convicted.
The Falls Pool is part of the 18,000 Glencalvie estate owned by
Highlands' newspaper group publisher Peter Fowler, but the devastation
also spread downstream to the Amat estate which includes tenant
crofters.
Its proprietor, Mr Jonathan Shaw, who charges #1000-a-week per rod,
has already suffered a cancellation next year because of the poisoning.
He said the local economy will suffer if anglers stay away. They hired
cars, bought fishing equipment, petrol, and groceries in the area where
they also dined out.
Mr Shaw insisted the estate, even with angling income, merely ''washed
its face,'' and added: ''It is the irresponsibility that worries me
about the poisoning.''
He said owners of the river system have offered a #5000 reward for
successful prosecution of whoever was responsible.
Mr Shaw, who is sponsored by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust to
study fishery management, said he favoured an educational approach to
curb poaching rather than draconian measures.
Kyle of Sutherland Angling Association has agreed to impose a catch
limit on members and visitors of one salmon or grilse per day to
conserve stocks.
Mr Russell Taylor, who runs a supermarket at Ardgay, said he will
consider cutting staff if business is hit. He predicted tourism will
''feel the pinch'' should anglers stay away.
Mr Colin Murray, of Invershin, who also has knowledge of the poaching
fraternity, confirmed he had been interviewed by police in connection
with the Carron incident.
He denied any involvement in the poisoning, but speculated that it was
was a revenge attack on bailiffs, proprietors, or former estate
employees.
Mr Murray added that alterations to netting rights at Bonar Bridge had
upset the local community. Jobs had been lost, while more fish moved
into the rivers to boost incomes of lairds, some absentee.
He said: ''Salmon have no-one's name on them, and people around here
will take their share.''

THE number of Scots with Aids or HIV infection attributed to
heterosexual intercourse has jumped dramatically over the past year.
Figures published yesterday by the Scottish Office reveal a 66% rise
in numbers with the disease itself, 18% in those who are HIV positive,
and 55% in the number who have died as a result of heterosexual
infection.
The cumulative totals to the end of June are -- HIV, 348 (294 in June
1994), Aids, 93 (56 last year), and dead, 48 (31 last year).
Overall, the total infected heterosexually represents 15.1% of those
infected since 1981, but although gay sex and intravenous drug use
remain the main sources of infection the latest figures leave no doubt
as to the potential for spread within the community.
The latest figures covering April, May, and June this year show that
eight men and 10 women were infected heterosexually, leaving a total of
157 men and 191 women since records began. Two men and four women
infected heterosexually had developed Aids and two men and three women
had died.
The death toll from Aids in Scotland stood at 494 yesterday as the
Scottish Office announced 34 new cases of the disease during April, May,
and June. This brings the cumulative total to 680, of whom 81% are male
and 19% female, and a further 23 people had died from the disease.
Of the total, 40% of the cases are related to sexual intercourse
between men and 37% to injecting drug use. This compares with 75% and
four per cent respectively for the rest of the UK.
This leaves 186 people with Aids still living in Scotland, from a
total of 2298 people known to have become HIV positive, with 49 new
cases of infection recorded from April to June. In the rest of the UK,
22,155 people have now been identified as being infected, of whom 11,051
have developed Aids and 7571 died.

A BOY of two was critical but stable in hospital last night after
falling 30ft from a balcony of his third floor home in Wester Hailes,
Edinburgh.
James Todd, a twin, and one of a family of five, is in intensive care
at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children.
Police left his home in Clovenstone Park with a number of items,
including a clothes drying frame thought to have been used by the boy to
climb up.
Edinburgh District Council said the balcony was above waist height on
a tall adult and too high for a child simply to fall over. It advised
that young children left on balconies should be supervised at all times.

POLICE yesterday launched a search and inquiries after human bones
were found near a footpath at Port Glasgow.
The bones were found on Monday by a man walking his dog by the side of
the A761 road between Port Glasgow and Kilmacolm. Initial forensic
examination indicated that they might be from a human hand.
Police were trying to find out how the bones came to be there and more
tests were being carried out by forensic experts.
Police said they did not yet know how old the bones were and said the
hand theory was an ''early indication'' which had yet to be confirmed.

TWENTY-ONE people were arrested at the Royal Navy's submarine base at
Faslane yesterday near the end of a protest to mark the 50th anniversary
of the Nagasaki bombing.
Demonstrators began converging on the base on Tuesday night for a
torchlight procession and staged a demonstration outside the main gates
yesterday.
At 11am, around 80 protestors gathered at the north gate of the base
and observed a minute's silence. At 11.02 (the time of the bombing) many
lay down outside, effectively closing the gates to traffic.
A base spokesman said MoD police made two arrests when demonstrators
attempted to get through the main gates. Strathclyde police said they
made 19 arrests, mainly for alleged disorderly behaviour.
Four protesters were arrested in London yesterday after minor scuffles
with police during a demonstration against French nuclear testing in the
south Pacific. The arrests came after a handful of people tried to enter
the French Consulate in South Kensington.

SCHOOLGIRL Sophie Hook died of asphyxia after being manually
strangled, a Home Office pathologist told an inquest yesterday.
Dr Donald Waite told the hearing at Bangor, Gwynedd, that he carried
out a post-mortem examination on the seven-year-old child after her body
was found on a beach at Llandudno on Sunday, July 30.
Dr Waite said: ''I visited the scene at 9am on July 30 and saw the
body of Sophie Hook lying on a deeply sloping beach covered by stones of
various sizes, lying below the high water mark.''
He said his full findings were in a report which had been sent to the
coroner and added: ''In my opinion, this child died as a result of
asphyxia due to manual strangulation.
''A second post-mortem has now been carried out and confirms that
cause of death. That was carried out yesterday.''
Sophie went missing while camping overnight in a tent in the back
garden of her uncle's Llandudno home.
The child's parents were not present at the hearing.
Coroner Dewi Pritchard-Jones said there was now no reason why the body
could not be released for the funeral in her home village of Great
Budworth on Friday.
He formally adjourned the inquest, explaining there would be no
resumption as long as there was a trial.
* Howard Hughes, 30, of Yerburgh Avenue, Colwyn Bay, has been charged
with murdering Sophie Hook. Hughes is due to face Llandudno magistrates
for the second time on August 30.

EDINBURGH'S homeless yesterday claimed they were being swept out of
the city centre as the capital gears up for the famous International
Festival.
The allegations have provoked anger from homeless groups, who say the
apparent crackdown will not resolve the problem.
A spokeswoman for the homeless pressure group Shelter said: ''Shelter
is appalled. It is certainly offensive to Shelter that homeless people
are begging on the streets of Edinburgh but the argument is not to move
them on elsewhere and away from the visitors but to provide the
resources to find them homes.''
HOwever, both Lothian and Borders Police and Edinburgh District
Council strongly deny the existence of a festival policy towards the
homeless.
''Our policy does not change in relation to people on the streets at
festival time. We are understanding and helpful to people who are
genuine homeless but where people are causing an obstruction or causing
a nuisance by harassing people or swearing at them, we will certainly
move them on,'' said a police spokesman.
The force's view was echoed by the city council.
''Edinburgh is renowned world wide as being a cultural hotch potch of
art, tourism, and beauty. There is absolutely no truth in these
allegations. We welcome people from all background, cultures and ethnic
origins,'' said a council spokeswoman.
On the streets, the homeless themselves said police appeared to be
stepping up a gear with the festival opening only days away.
Michael, 42, orginally from Bradford, West Yorkshire, who has been
homeless for four years, said he had been moved on by police from the
city centre three times in the last week alone.
''They move you on now and again but it's definitely worse when the
festival's approaching,'' he said.
Deano, 42, a Big Issue vendor, said officers increasingly had been
moving on many of his homeless friends from the city centre streets in
recent weeks.
Mark, who is also homeless, accused officers of ''trying to sweep the
homeless under the carpet'' during the three-week arts extravaganza.
''The police are kicking people who live on the streets,'' he said.
Ms Elaine Campbell, of Grassmarket Advice Centre, which helps scores
of homeless people every week, said recent experience had shown police
appeared to be tougher on the street people in the weeks leading to the
arts extravaganza.
''It does go on all the time but the powers that be seem to be
stricter, if you like, as the festival approaches.
''We're not condoning the people that harass the tourists but there
are a genuine number of homeless people who don't have anywhere to stay
and are sitting out enjoying a bit of sun, not bothering anybody. They
should be left in peace,'' she said.

This is some peace, says 'punishment' victim in Belfast hospital with
bullet wounds.
THE Provisional IRA faced a wave of condemnation yesterday after what
is believed to be the first ''punishment'' shooting since it declared a
ceasefire almost a year ago. Fears are growing of a resumption of
violence as soon as the anniversary passes.
A 24-year-old Belfast man, Simon Murray, was kidnapped, beaten, and
shot in both elbows in the early hours of yesterday morning.
The incident was swiftly condemned by Ulster Unionists and the SDLP.
Mr Murray, an unemployed father-of-two, said he was making his way
home at 1.30am when he was dragged into a car by a number of men.
He was driven to the strongly republican Ardoyne area where he was
pinned to the ground and battered with sticks, he said from his hospital
bed.
''A couple of them held me down while the others beat me,'' he said,
''but after the first blow I sort of lost consciousness.
''I thought that I was just in for a punishment beating -- and I
didn't even see the gun.''
An ambulance found Mr Murray with bullet wounds to both elbows at
Herbert Street around 2.30am.
A year ago he was the victim of a beating administered by a
paramilitary gang.
He said last night that he did not know why he had been singled out
again. ''This is some peace indeed,'' he remarked.
Mr Murray refused to say if he knew who attacked him.
''I can't say anything about them. I am just too scared.''
The RUC said a number of men were being questioned about the attack.
Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP, said the incident was another
breach of the IRA's ceasefire and claimed it proved the terrorists had
embarked on a ''rolling resumption'' of violence.
''This was as much a signal to the Government as a punishment
attack,'' he said.
Mr Martin Morgan, SDLP spokesman in north Belfast, said the attack
stripped its victim and the community of their dignity.
Spokesmen for Sinn Fein were unavailable for comment.
The Families Against Intimidation and Terror organisation joined the
condemnation and challenged Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams to explain
what the attack meant for the peace process.
Nancy Gracey of FAIT said: ''This is very worrying as we are
approaching the anniversary of the IRA ceasefire. People are concerned
that this could be a signal that it is coming to an end.''
The shooting follows a series of brutal beatings carried out by gangs
in the Ardoyne area recently.
A 19-year-old man was hooded and beaten at Norglen Gardens in the Turf
Lodge district of west Belfast on Tuesday night. He required stitches to
leg wounds.
Mr Adams would not comment about the incident, but he called upon
Northern Ireland's Orange marchers to call off their parades through
places where they were ''not welcome''.
The move put renewed pressure on the Loyalist Apprentice Boys to call
off their planned parades this weekend through Catholic areas.
Mr Adams accused some loyalist marchers of taking part in
''coat-trailing exercises'' designed to provoke members of the minority
Catholic community.
''Surely at this decisive time in our history and after everything
that all sections of our people have endured, wiser councils within
Orangeism will prevail and parades into areas where they are not welcome
will be abandoned,'' he said.
Mr Adams said he upheld the right to civil and religious liberty, but
that no religion should be hijacked by sectarian elements.
''I know many Protestant people share my concern,'' he added.
Meanwhile, the RUC said it was investigating a threat from two
officers of the County Down Apprentice Boys that if marches in
Londonderry and Belfast were re-routed this weekend, they would blockade
Catholic chapels and prevent Catholics from attending mass.
The Apprentice Boys' governor, Alastair Simpson, denied they were
planning such action.
The County Down Amalgamated Committee should not have gone public with
the blockade threat, he added.
The statement issued by his colleagues comes before a general
committee meeting next month, said Mr Simpson.
''This correspondence which was sent was due to be discussed at a
meeting in September but somebody gave it to the press,'' he said. ''As
far as I am aware, there is no blockade of any chapel.
''We stand for civil and religious liberty and as far as I am
concerned that is being kept''
The Apprentice Boys have applied to walk on the walls of Londonderry
and along the Ormeau Road past a Catholic area in Belfast on Saturday.
So far the police have made no decision on the routes.

ANOTHER mass poisoning of salmon cannot be ruled out at a Highland
rivers system which contains some of Scotland's most famous and
exclusive fishing beats.
More than 1100 salmon suffocated to death on the River Carron in
Ross-shire last month when Cymag was released into the Glencarvie Falls
pool, wiping out all life for two miles downstream.
Chalked in block capitals on the riverside rock-face was the word
''THINK''. It was a warning to lairds, bailiffs, and police to allow
local poachers to go about their business unhindered, The Herald can
reveal.
It has also emerged that the attack could have taken place just as
easily on the Rivers Oykel, Shin, and Cassley which, like the Carron,
flow into the Kyle of Sutherland near Bonar Bridge.
The Carron was chosen to highlight a wide-ranging series of
deep-rooted grievances against some of its properietors and the
authorities, although other motives, including revenge or sheer spite,
cannot be ruled out.
Mr Sandy Chalmers, a school bus driver with close links to the
poaching fraternity in Kyle, said that the poisoning -- which he could
not condone under any circumstances -- was designed to ''point the
finger'' at people who were upsetting the locals over fishing rights.
He said: ''If they do not back off, I think it will happen again.
There is no dialogue between the locals and the bailiffs or the fishery
board. But there has to be some dialogue -- and locals' rights have to
be respected.''
Mr Chalmers, of Invershin, near Bonar Bridge, said that for centuries
locals had taken salmon for the pot, and even for profit, with respect
shown by each side. However, in recent years they had been ''pushed and
pushed'', and the Carron poisoning had been a warning that ''enough was
enough''.
He was flanked by neighbour Colin Murray, 23, an unemployed university
graduate who has been interviewed by police in connection with the Falls
Pool attack, which is claimed could cost the local economy millions and
damage the river's eco-system for 30 years.
Mr Murray strenuously denied any involvement in the poisoning before
speaking passionately about the ''rights'' of locals to poach fish which
''had no name on them'' until caught by visitors who paid the lairds
vast sums for landing wild salmon.
Both men complained at the failure of proprietors to provide a fish
ladder at the Carron Falls, where queuing fish -- a boon to anglers --
risk disease in low water en route to spawning beds.
They also protested at a loss of local jobs associated with changes to
netting practices at Bonar Bridge, where more fish are entering the
rivers -- allowing lairds, including absentee landlords, to charge even
more.
The warning that another poisoning appears inevitable unless
authorities relax their grip on local poachers came within hours of
river superintendent Charles Menzies declaring that such threats will
not work.
He said the poisoning had had the opposite effect than intended on
bailiffs. Far from drawing back, they were determined to protect the
rivers. More men and equipment would be brought in if necessary.

<TEXT>
A RECIPE for bombs like the one used to devastate the federal building
in Oklahoma City has been published on a Dundee University computer.
A student, whose name is given on the system as Allan John Paterson,
is to be investigated for adding the how-to guide to Dundee's Internet
site.
Computer users from around the world have been able to download the
guide, which explains how to build massive fertiliser-based bombs, since
Paterson appended it to the university's ''Home Pages'' earlier this
year.
An unnoticed addition to Dundee's mathematics and computer science
computer site led users to a section Paterson had composed himself.
There, they could access recipes for bombs and small grenades, get
information on pirate software and hacking, and view a picture of
Paterson himself.
Mr Richard Murphy, director of Dundee University's information
technology services, said: ''Systems like this one, which is attached to
thousands of other computers around the world, need to be reasonbly open
to be useful.
''If you start restricting access to them they stop having any value.
Having unfortunate items like this appear occasionally is the price you
pay for being so accessible.''
Mr Murphy said access to Paterson's pages would be closed off
immediately and an investigation begun.  University secretary Bob Seaton
commented: ''There is an increasing number of computers and access
points on campus and several staff members have expressed concern at
their proliferation. There have already been discussions taking place on
this issue and it may well be that stricter guidelines for computer use
will be drawn up.''

BBC reporter John Schofield was killed yesterday in Croatia near the
border with the Bihac region of northern Bosnia.
The journalist was shot and killed immediately by a single bullet
through the neck, the BBC said. Two colleagues were injured when
Croatian forces opened fire on them.
He and the three World Service TV colleagues, had just got out of
their armoured car to film what they believed were burning villages when
they came under small arms fire. All four were wearing flak jackets.
The shooting came as the UN raised the first accusations of atrocities
against civilians in Krajina.
A UN spokeswoman said that, according to an eyewitness account from a
member of the Danish peacekeeping contingent, a group of five old
people, some mentally handicapped and one in a wheelchair, were shot
dead by soldiers wearing uniforms bearing Bosnian army insignia.
Last night a UN-brokered peace deal saw an end to most of the fighting
in Croatia and paved the way for a further exodus of exhausted refugees
to neighbouring Serbia.
Mr Schofield, 29, was preparing a programme for The World Tonight on
Radio 4.
He had been working as a reporter for eight years, beginning his
career at ITN as an editorial trainee and joining the BBC in May 1994.
He had previously reported on the Gulf war for ITN.
The BBC party had been travelling with a British Overseas Development
Administration convoy heading for Bihac earlier in the day, but were
alone at the time of the attack.
They were travelling between Karlovac in Croatia and Bihac in Bosnia
and had got out to start filming, said the BBC spokesman.
''They spotted what appeared to be burning villages and got out to
film. They were lying down when they came under sustained small arms
fire from the Croatian army.
''John Schofield was killed immediately by a single bullet through the
neck.
''The Croatian army reached them and immediately summoned ambulances.
They were all taken to Karlovac hospital, where they received medical
treatment.
''The British Embassy in Zagreb has been informed and is assisting in
the recovery of the body. A request has been made to transfer it to
Zagreb morgue tonight, and it will eventually be returned to the UK.
''The UN in Zagreb have indicated that they will help and will conduct
an informal inquiry into what took place.
Colleagues Adam Kelleher and Omar Osawi, from BBC World Service TV,
suffered ricochet wounds, Mr Kelleher to the wrist and Mr Osawi to the
leg.
A fourth member of the party, Jonathan Birchall, also of World Service
TV, was uninjured.
There was no information about why the Croats fired.
In Zagreb, Croatian Defence Ministry spokesman Major General Ivan
Tolj, claimed rebel Serb soldiers were responsible for Schofield's
death. He charged the reporters ''illegally'' entered a dangerous area
where ''small groups of Serb paramilitary troops could be hiding''.
Mr Bob Phillis, deputy director-general of the BBC, said: ''John
Schofield was a fine and courageous reporter, who was held in very high
regard. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family.''
An ITN spokesman said: ''It is with great sadness that ITN learned
today of the death of John Schofield.
''John Schofield will be greatly missed by everyone who knew him at
ITN as a fine journalist and a colleague who made friends wherever he
worked.''
Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the BBC, said: ''The tragic death of
John Schofield in Croatia this afternoon has shocked all of us in the
BBC, as it will shock our viewers and listeners around the world.
''Our sympathy and prayers go out to his widow and family.
''Our coverage of this terrible war will continue, but we must never
forget the courage of all those who bring us the news.''

SCOTLAND'S hospital chiefs have reacted coolly to a proposal to offer
wage increases directly to staff as a way around the health service pay
dispute.
The plan is the brainchild of Mr Ken Jarrold, director of human
resources for the NHS Management Executive, who has been circulating it
among senior trust executives in the course of a ''road show'' aimed at
cracking the dispute.
Scottish trust directors were briefed on the proposal at a meeting
with Scottish Management Executive officials. One of them yesterday
described it as ''daft''.
It is aimed at breaking the deadlock caused by the unions'
unwillingness to accept the principle of local pay bargaining, even if
individual trusts were offering satisfactory increases -- 2% without
strings on top of the 1% base offered nationally.
Mr Jarrold has been telling trust directors in England and Wales that
if further discussions with staff representatives are unsuccessful, they
should give notice of their intention to offer individual members of
staff the amount to which they would be entitled from each local offer.
However, the health workers would not have the money stuffed into
their pay packets against their will.
Mr Jarrold's circular says: ''It is essential that payments are made
with their consent . . . make it plain in your letter that any member of
staff who wishes to defer receipt of the payment until there is a
national settlement will be free to do so by notifying the trust in
writing and that this will not be regarded in any way as offending
against his or her contract of employment.''
Mr Jarrold admitted there were risks in this approach: ''It is
possible that staff will accept payment and still engage in industrial
action because they still identify themselves as being on national
contracts and as not having accepted the principle of local pay.
''However, acceptance of payments by substantial numbers of staff will
make it difficult for the staff side to initiate or sustain industrial
action at either local or national level. It is important to be able to
demonstrate to the review body, the media, and the public that staff
have accepted local payments.''
The Scottish trust chief said: ''I think the consensus in the Scottish
health service is to reject Mr Jarrold's approach. We find it
unacceptable, when there is an opportunity for collective bargaining, to
introduce something that would be perceived as being imposed.''
Ms June Andrews, Scottish Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing,
described the Jarrold plan as a desperate move by the NHS management to
demonstrate to the Pay Review Body that they had delivered local pay.
The review body will begin taking evidence next month for next year's
award.
''We have taken advice on this and have detailed information to send
to RCN staff and stewards telling them how they should respond to such
an event,'' Ms Andrews said.
''We are pointing out that if anyone gives you money, even if you take
it, it does not mean you are accepting the principle of local pay.''

A COMPANY director who denied that a string of affairs led to the
breakdown of his marriage, has been divorced against his wishes.
A judge has also ordered that Mr Michael Murley transfer his
half-share in the #154,000 family home to his wife who was awarded
custody of the couple's two children.
At the Court of Session, Mrs Catriona Murley asked Lord MacLean to
grant her a divorce on the basis that the marriage had broken down
because of her husband's unreasonable behaviour.
The couple were married at St Paul's Cathedral, London, in March 1977
and separated in May 1993. Lord MacLean said there was no prospect of a
reconciliation.
Mr Murley, of Merkland Cottage, Thornhill, Dumfriesshire, is the
principal director of Pet and Garden Manufacturing Ltd, which has a
factory in Sanquhar, Dumfries-shire.
Mrs Murley, a graduate in fashion and textile design, is a freelance
consultant with a Bond Street firm at its mill in Innerleithen.
The judge said: ''Although Mr Murley maintained that he still wished
to be married to his wife, I have considerable difficulty in accepting
that assertion, not least because he is currently living with another
lady in rented property not far from the matrimonial home.''
Lord MacLean said he was entirely satisfied that the marriage was at
an end.
Mr Murley, who conducted his own case, denied his behaviour had caused
the breakdown of the marriage but Lord MacLean said the evidence more
than satisfied him that the husband had behaved unreasonably.
The judge added: ''Nowhere was that more eloquently expressed than by
Mrs Murley when she was cross-examined by her husband, who asked her
about the unreasonable nature of his behaviour.
''She responded by referring to his adultery and to the fact that,
during the marriage, he had had at least four affairs, none of which she
had forgiven.''
She had also talked of his concentration on his business ventures to
the neglect of his family and said that no sooner would he be back on an
even keel financially than another extramarital affair would be
discovered.
The couple have two children: Alex, 13, and Tamsin, eight. Mr Murley
currently pays #175 a month for each and the couple were agreed that
should continue under a court order.
The #154,000 family home at Sanquhar House, Sanquhar, is jointly owned
by the couple and there is no mortgage on it. Mr Murley wanted it to be
sold off but his wife wished it to be kept for herself and the children.
Lord MacLean said the total value of the couple's assets, including
#66,000 worth of shares Mr Murley owned in his company, was #260,000. If
that was equally divided, the Murleys were due #130,000 each.
Lord MacLean decided that Mrs Murley should get her husband's
half-share in Sanquhar House, which would give her a total of #154,000
and to balance the settlement, ordered her to pay her husband #24,000 if
the house was sold or when Tamsin became 18.
He also ordered Mr Murley to pay the legal expenses of the court case,
adding: ''I do so because I consider that, however valiantly he
conducted his case on his own behalf, he has failed in almost every
submission he made.''
Mr Murley yesterday declined to discuss specific aspects of the
judge's ruling when he spoke to The Herald at his Sanquhar premises.
Surrounded by members of staff, he said: ''I would ask you to treat
this case sympathetically. It is very unfortunate.
''I am anxious that this is reported thoughtfully because of the
children. I would ask you to read all the case papers very carefully
before you write anything.
''I am worried about the children and for that reason I have nothing
else to say.''
Mr Murley has built up the company in recent years with support from
Dumfries and Galloway Enterprise. He made news recently with a
revolutionary product to keep dogs and cats out of gardens.
There was no-one at home Sanquhar House.
A gardener working in the tree-lined grounds of the former manse said
Mrs Murley had left with the children after learning the result of the
case at the Court of Session.
He added: ''She was over the moon, very happy with what happened.''

A BROTHER and sister living in Scotland, who faced being deported to
their troubled West African homeland, have won a 12-month reprieve from
the Home Office.
Ms Julliett Robbin, 18, and her 16-year-old brother Valicious have
been granted atemporary stay that stops them being sent back to Sierra
Leone, from which they fled during the civil war there nearly four years
ago.
The decision to allow them to remain in Scotland for another year was
ratified by Home Secretary Michael Howard in London and the pair's
lawyers were notified by telephone yesterday.
Details of the visa to be granted the brother and sister will be
studied over the next few days by their legal team.
The move is looked on as an important step in the campaign to keep the
teenagers in Britain. Pressure is now likely to be stepped up to build
on the decision and try to end the uncertainty over their future.
In announcing the move, a Home Office spokesman said: ''We have given
the brother and sister involved a 12-month stay in this case. Once that
time is over, we will look at the case again.
''The paperwork has just been completed on the case and those involved
will be notified forthwith.''
The long-running saga began four years ago when the two arrived in
Scotland to be with their father. However, when they got here, they were
told it wasn't possible to live with him.
That led to Valicious Robbin having to be fostered by a family in
Balerno near Edinburgh. His sister, who has two young children, was
given a home of her own in Livingston.
Despite the unfamiliar surroundings and having no family support, both
settled in well. Valicious Robbin has just left Firhill High School,
where he had been praised for his academic achievement. His classmates
strongly supported his fight to stay in Scotland and collected a
petition which they presented to the Home Office.
The pair were due to be sent back to Sierra Leone on March 19 of this
year. That order was not enforced because of an application by them to
the Court of Session for a judicial review of the removal decision.
It is believed the Home Office has been having second thoughts about
sending them back.
During the Court of Session hearing two months ago, lawyers for the
two argued that the decision to return them to Sierra Leone was
unreasonable. The Home Office made it clear, however, that it did not
intend to send them back until it was considered safe to do so. Against
that background, Lord Cameron granted an order halting the court
hearing.
A spokesman for Glasgow-based Gray and Company, which is dealing with
the case, said he had not yet seen details of the decision and could not
comment. Neither Valicious nor Julliett Robbin were available for
comment.

MUSHY peas could lose their characteristic green colour unless a
manufacturer wins a David and Goliath battle with Brussels over the use
of a dye in the frozen version of the delicacy.
The Euro-ban on the dye, which does not affect tinned mushy peas,
comes into force next June and manufacturers fear they will lose
business.
Mr John Clark, sales director of Lockwoods of Ambergate, Derbyshire,
Britain's main producer with a #2.2m annual turnover, said: ''I don't
know what we are going to do. We have been producing mushy peas for 30
years and the dye we use is harmless.''
Mr Clark, whose firm employs 24 people, said they had not been
consulted over the ban. They have been told they must cease production
at the end of December and the product will not be sold in shops after
June.
The dye, which is used in other foods, is needed because marrowfat
peas turn grey or yellow when dried before reaching the factory.
The Ministry of Agriculture said yesterday Lockwoods may have been
overlooked in the consultation process, but said it would be difficult
to reverse the EU directive.

THERE seemed to be division in the ranks among Glasgow Airport taxi
drivers yesterday after discussions about a plan to improve the service
they provide.
As reported in The Herald yesterday, the airport has decided to
appoint a management agency to oversee the taxi operation there. Changes
to be introduced next month will include a strict dress code for
drivers, training courses in ''customer relations'', and a requirement
that no vehicle is more than four years old.
The successful bidder for the management agency contract is the
Cab-Fly company, set up by partners Mr Brian Connolly and Mr William
Stewart, both of whom have many years of experience as taxi drivers at
the airport.
Yesterday, Cab-Fly met representatives of the taxi associations, of
non-associated drivers and of the airport management to discuss the new
regime.
After the meeting, some drivers' representatives expressed
disappointment that all the changes were to be introduced as planned,
while others welcomed the new conditions. However, it seems all the
drivers are reconciled to the fact that the changes are going ahead.
The Airport Taxi Services association, which says it represents more
than half of the airport's 200 permit holders, feels some of the new
conditions are too strict, particularly the rule regarding the age of
vehicles.
Mr Charlie Mitchell, ATS chairman, said after the meeting: ''They are
going to implement all the rules to the full. We do not mind
co-operating with most of them but this will put some of the guys in a
very tight financial position.
''I am disappointed, on behalf of a lot of our members. It will put
them in difficult circumstances but if that is what the airport plans
then that is the way things will have to go.''
Mr Dave Clark, secretary of Paisley and Glasgow Airport Taxi Owners'
Association, which says it has about 30 airport permit-holders, said:
''We are in agreement with everything that the airport is doing. We feel
there has been a lack of enforcement within the taxi trade and the
airport is taking the bull by the horns.
''Standards have been dropping -- standards of dress, the type of
cars, the whole standard of the trade. The discipline has gone a little
bit. The new rules will improve the taxi trade in the district and
improve the image presented to the public.''
Mr Connolly of Cab-Fly said: ''The meeting went very well and everyone
seemed quite happy with the recommendations that we put forward. The ATS
people have some misgivings about the car age restriction but they are
accepting it. They realise that there has got to be an upgrading.''
* Meanwhile, a leading civil servant has been appointed to lead
Glasgow Airport Initiative, the project which aims to create Scotland's
first international business park in the hinterland around the airport
and so attract #400m of investment and generate 16,000 jobs over the
next 10 years.
Mr Ian McGhee, formerly head of exports, publicity, and technology
division at the Scottish Office, is joining Renfrewshire Enterprise on

A DEFIANT grandfather whose home is due to be demolished to make way
for an extension at Glasgow airport saw off another legal challenge
yesterday.
Glasgow Airport Ltd has served a compulsory purchase order on Mr Tony
Chalk, 49, whose flat in Douglas Terrace, Abbotsinch, is on the site of
a proposed new business park.
Last Saturday sheriff officers called at the flat, broke down the door
and evicted the family.
Mr Chalk claimed they were acting unlawfully following an order at
Paisley Sheriff Court to put the eviction on hold for 14 days.
He immediately took his case to the Court of Session, where Lord Gill
granted an interim interdict holding up the eviction proceedings until
Glasgow Airport decided to come back to court. The order also allowed Mr
Chalk back into his flat.

<HEADLINE>Bar-code scanner unveiled to combat benefit fraudsters</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

THE latest weapon in the fight against benefit fraudsters was unveiled
by the Government yesterday -- a supermarket-style electronic scanner.
Bar codes similar to those found on food packets in supermarkets will
be put on benefit order books.
These can then be read by the scanner, which is linked to a computer
data base and reveal whether the order book is a counterfeit or has been
stolen.
The new system will be set up in 1462 post offices across Greater
London and the South East at a cost of #7m.
However, fraudsters who flee to other parts of the country will not
escape the new technology as a mobile scanner will also be set up.
Tests on the Electronic Stop Notice System across 180 post offices in
London saved #29m in just nine months.
Junior Social Security Minister Oliver Heald launched the new device
during a visit to the nerve centre of the system in Euston Road, London.
He said: ''We are determined to eliminate fraud which is a most
selfish crime as every pound obtained fraudulently means a pound less
for those genuinely entitled to benefit.
''We believe about #300m a year is probably at risk through benefit
fraud involving order books which aren't valid.''
Sophisticated gangs of fraudsters are at work across southern England
and Mr Heald admitted: ''We are only one step ahead.
''Operation Tiptoe this year found 16 people using up to 2000
identities and #250,000 which they were taking out of the system and
luckily we caught them.''
Yesterday's new scheme is part of Social Security Secretary Peter
Lilley's campaign to lop #2000m off the amount lost to fraudsters over
the next three years.
The scheme covers only those claimants who use order books to collect
benefits, such as pensions, child benefit, income support, and
incapacity benefit.
The test on the system is said to have played a part in securing
prosecutions of fraudsters trapped by the new scanning device.
Mr Heald also announced further anti-fraud measures, including
re-designing Giro cheques.
Shadow Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar accused the Government
of launching its anti-fraud campaign for the ''umpteenth'' time.
''Labour strongly supports the sensible use of technology to combat
fraud, he said.
''What is tiresome is the constant attempt by Ministers to establish
their machismo credentials when the record in no way justifies the hype.
''Populist speeches from Mr Lilley on this subject have become an
annual autumn event.''

A HILLWALKER who spent five days trapped on a narrow ledge, after
falling 80ft and sustaining serious injuries, last night told how he
survived on one day's rations and sips from his water bottle.
Mr Robert Sparkes, 57, a lecturer at Stirling University, was found
yesterday afternoon on the third day of an extensive search in Glen
Etive, near Glen Coe.
Last night, he was recovering in Belford Hospital, Fort William. A
spokesman said Mr Sparkes was being treated for fractures to his back,
shoulder, sternum, and ankle and he may be moved to a hospital in
Glasgow today.
The spokesman added: ''He is pretty stable, and lucid but is generally
dehydrated and hungry.''
Mr Sparkes' wife, Margaret, who was at his bedside, said: ''Words
can't express my gratitude to everyone. My husband was well equipped,
very experienced, and very fit and that obviously helped him to survive
his ordeal.''
She said her husband often undertook walks alone but always put safety
first. His Christian faith, she said, would have played a large part in
helping him endure his solitude and suffering.
Chief Inspector John MacFadzean praised his courage, saying: ''He is
one of the few survival miracles we get in Lochaber.''
Mr Sparkes, of Culbowie Crescent, Buchlyvie, had set out on a solo
walking trip last Thursday. The alarm was raised when he failed to
arrive at Glen Nevis youth hostel on Sunday night.
Fears for his safety had been mounting after the 50-strong search
party, comprising five mountain rescue teams, search dogs, and a
helicopter from HMS Gannet, failed to locate him.
However, shortly before 3pm yesterday, the helicopter crew spotted him
lying at the bottom of a steep gully on Stob Dubh.
They decided against trying to airlift him directly, afraid that the
machine's down-draught might blow him off the ledge. Instead, rescuers
scrambled down to him and he was taken by stretcher to the helicopter
and flown to hospital.
The observer on the Sea King helicopter, Lieutenant Steve Wood, said
last night: ''We saw the injured man on a 5 ft-wide grassy ledge waving
to us. He had rolled and tumbled about 80ft down the crevasse on to the
ledge.
''Below him was another 75ft and if he had gone over that he would
certainly have been killed. He is an extremely lucky man to have escaped
death.''
Mr Sparkes told the crew he had been on the ledge since Saturday.
There was a trickle of water from a nearby waterfall but he relied on
sipping from his water bottle and eking out his rations.
At the family home in Buchlyvie, Mr Sparkes' sister-in-law Judith
David said yesterday: '' We had almost given up hope. We don't yet know
how he managed to survive -- and he must have been eaten alive by
midges.''

AN elderly man, who lay undiscovered for 30 hours last week in the
toilet of a Fife doctors' surgery, died in hospital yesterday.
Mr John Ross, 86, of Sea Road, Methil, was thought to have suffered a
stroke after attending the nearby Muiredge Surgery to collect a
prescription for his wife. His presence went unnoticed by surgery
cleaning staff.
Within the past few days, it was confirmed that his family had sought
legal advice.
Family solicitor David Ritchie confirmed Mr Ross's death in Victoria
Hospital, Kirkcaldy, stating: ''I have been authorised simply to give
the fact that Mr Ross passed away this afternoon.
''It goes without saying that the family are deeply upset. They would
prefer to make no further comment meantime.''
The surgery has already admitted that procedures for checking and
securing the practice were not followed and that the reasons would be
investigated thoroughly.
Fife Health Board, which announced recently that it would be
investigating why Mr Ross, a former docker, was not found, issued a
statement yesterday saying that it was deeply shocked at what had
happened.
''As a result of this tragic event, a working group has been set up to
look at the whole issue of security in doctors' premises in Fife. We
will do everything we can to make sure this sort of thing never happens
again.''
Yesterday, Fife Central MP Henry McLeish again called for a security
code of conduct to be introduced in all Scottish surgeries in an effort
to prevent a similar incident.

In Gothenburg
SCOTLAND'S Commonwealth 10,000 metres champions present and past,
Yvonne Murray and Liz McColgan, finished out of the medals last night at
the World Athletics Championships in Sweden.
Motherwell's Murray fell heavily after seven laps but though she
jumped up in pursuit she had been severely winded and suffered cramp,
dropping out with 10 laps of the 25 still to run.
Although she is Scottish record holder at 5000m and fifth fastest in
the world this year, there is no prospect of Murray running in that
event today.
''I suffered damage to my right knee and bruising and scrapes to my
side,'' said Murray through tears. ''I am pretty stiff and sore, but
that's nothing to the hurt I feel inside. Words can't describe that.''
McColgan, world champion four years ago but written off after illness
and injury, ran well to finish sixth.

A JOB is being created for the high-profile director of Strathclyde
region's education department, Mr Frank Pignatelli, whose present post
will disappear when local government is reorganised next April.
Mr Pignatelli has not applied for any jobs as he oversees the break-up
of Britain's biggest local authority education service and the transfer
of its work to the new councils.
However, the new City of Glasgow Council has moved quickly to create a
post for him and his #94,500 salary, which is about #1400 short of the
sum paid to Mr John Anderson, the chief executive of what will be the
biggest of Scotland's single-tier authorities.
Councillor Robert Gould, Labour leader of the new council, confirmed
last night that the authority wanted to use Mr Pignatelli's ''skills and
professionalism in the vital youth work, voluntary sector, and special
needs areas''.
The executive of the City of Glasgow Labour group agreed on Tuesday
that Mr Pignatelli's talents should be employed in these areas, which
will face severe challenges because of the impending loss of central
funding from Strathclyde and the region's strategic powers.
However, some members of the Glasgow Labour executive expressed
disquiet about the post being created at a time of cuts in services and
jobs ''being reorganised out of existence''.
Like thousands of other local authority employees, however, Mr
Pignatelli has a statutory right to be transferred to a new council,
with salary conserved for three years.
The Glasgow Labour executive has decided that it should exploit Mr
Pignatelli's experience and expertise in areas which may be fraught with
difficulties. It would clearly be unacceptable for him to be viewed as a
supernumerary in the new council.
If he accepts the post, he will report directly to Mr Anderson. Mr
Pignatelli would be responsible for local authority funding and
strategic management issues affecting such areas as day-time provision
for under-fives, ethnic minority groups, drugs forums, and uniformed
groups such as the Boys' Brigade and the Scouts.
Mr Pignatelli said last night: ''Co-ordinating funding after the
demise of Strathclyde will be a complex and big issue in Glasgow. I want
to ensure that there is a smooth transition of services to the new
authorities and if the Glasgow council believes there is a job I can do,
I would be delighted to do it.''
He said, however, that no detailed discussions about the post had
taken place and he expected to find out more when Mr Anderson returned
from holiday.
