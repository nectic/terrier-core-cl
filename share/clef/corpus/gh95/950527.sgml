COLOMBO: Tamil Tiger rebels killed 42 people in attack on a Sri Lankan
fishing village yesterday, the military said. The raid on Sinhalese
families in Kallawara by up to 200 rebels was the first serious attack
on civilians in three years. Earlier, gunmen also shot dead a leading
Buddhist priest who opposed the rebel cause.

THE Liberal Democrats forecast yesterday that they would do a Perth
and Kinross at the next by-election, Littleborough and Saddleworth in
the north of England.
But Mr Paddy Ashdown's declaration that his party would not keep the
Tories in office if there was a hung Parliament after the next General
Election has created consternation in the area among local party
members: they see Labour as the main enemy.
Mr Chris Davies, who cut the majority of the late Tory MP Mr Geoffrey
Dickens to 4494 at the General Election and is likely to be chosen as
the by-election candidate said: ''We and Labour are in deep and bitter
conflict in many parts of the country and there is no point trying to
pretend we can get any closer to Labour than we are.''
Ms Liz Lynne, Lib-Dem MP for neighbouring Rochdale, where she held off
Labour by a narrow 1800 votes, admitted she was unhappy about the
policy. ''I would have preferred it if Paddy had maintained our original
stance that we would not do any deals either with Labour or the
Tories,'' she said.
At Westminster senior Labour sources made much of the fact that in
Littleborough the Lib Dems and Conservatives work closely together on
the local council. ''It makes no sense for the Liberals to represent
themselves as the main challengers to the Tories in an area where they
are so close to them,'' one said.
A Liberal Democrat spokeswoman called this ''absolute rubbish''. She
said: ''We are the clear challengers and in a stronger position than we
were in Eastleigh in Hampshire which we won from the Tories last year.''
Labour, having fallen short of its highest hopes in Perth, will reckon
to do better in the seat, a suburban sprawl within the Greater
Manchester metropolitan area.
It polled nearly 20% of the vote at the General Election but the
Liberal Democrats were well ahead with almost 36% and will use the SNP
refrain: ''If you want the Tory out, we are the people to vote for.''
Conservative Central Office is likely to postpone the by-election
until late July or August, after the Commons rises for the long summer
recess. The Tories look certain to lose the seat, bringing the
Government's Commons majority into single figures.
Mr Paddy Ashdown defended his ''tilt towards Labour'' decision, backed
by the party's federal executive on Thursday night, at a Westminster
news conference.
However, in an article in Liberal News aimed at selling the move to
the party rank and file Mr Ashdown said: ''Opposition to the
Conservatives does not mean cosying up to the Labour Party.''
Despite this protestation, the Conservative party chairman, Mr Jeremy
Hanley, was not slow to say: ''This proves what we have said for a long
time that a vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote for Labour.''
The Littleborough by-election will provide the first test of the new
doctrine and show whether the Liberal Democrat's ''opening to the left''
will or will not hurt them electorally.
Former Rochdale Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith criticised Mr Ashdown's
statement saying the inference was that the party would prop up a Labour
government. ''That,'' he said, ''is absolutely ridiculous and daft.''
Party headquarters, however, said Mr Ashdown had given no undertakings
about supporting Labour.
He told the news conference that his party's position could be easily
summed up: ''No quarter for the Tories, no let up for Labour.''

There are still pockets of Thailand where the waves of mass tourism
have not yet eroded the unhurried way of life. David Wishart visited the
beguiling resort of Koh Samui, where a leading cause of death to
visitors is falling coconuts.
THE hotel guest at Baan Talin Nam sat on his lounger under a thatch
umbrella and soaked up the experience: a beach of soft, white sand, warm
sea the colour of sapphire, a clump of rocky islands standing starkly
against the cloudless sky, and at his elbow a uniformed waiter serving a
cold drink.
There was practically nobody else around, a not unexpected situation
as he was on a one-hotel beach on the quiet side of a tiny island in the
Gulf of Thailand.
Well, until the day trippers arrived, and the monkey.
But it being a Mandarin Oriental hotel, they of the Oriental in
Bangkok and of late the Ritz in London, the day trippers did not roll up
their pants, wear kiss-me-quick hats, and holler for fish and chips.
Stepping ashore from the Seabourn Pride, one of the most expensive
cruise ships afloat, they were quite at home here. They changed at
air-conditioned bungalows fronting the beach, had a swim and enjoyed an
exquisite buffet lunch at tables set with crisp linen.
When the monkey arrived they politely applauded as his owner put him
through his paces. Wearing a collar with a long lead, the monkey
scampered up a palm tree, selected a ripe coconut and pulled it free
with a few twirls of his paws. Others talked with the Swiss general
manager of the hotel, who, one imagines, can count on the
four-times-a-year Seabourn visits to land him affluent cruisers who want
to return and stay awhile. Then they were gone, the tide at Baan Taling
Ngam washed away the day trippers' footprints and the hotel guest, and
the coconut, had the beach to themselves.
It used to be like this on Koh Samui -- just coconuts, young
travellers and a small population of Thai fisherman and growers who
harvested the coconuts. The travellers were of that pioneering breed
that seek out cheap places in the sun. They had been to Bali, Goa and
nearby Phuket, but the word had spread, via cafes in Amsterdam and
Lonely Planet guidebooks, and mainstream resorts had followed, then
charter jets from Frankfurt, Paris, Stockholm and London. Hippie havens
gave way to Club Meds, para-sailing landed on their nude beaches, and
prices soared into the cloudless skies.
The inevitable migration eventually brought them to Koh (it means
island) Samui, a short ferry ride east of the Malay peninsula, probably
in the sixties. Thai fishermen rented them simple thatched huts for 10
bob a day. They frolicked in the shade of palm trees and lived a
Robinson Crusoe life with plentiful fish and cool, fresh milk from
coconuts. They might have done a little gardening as well, but whatever
they grew it wasn't turnips.
Nobody can say what spared Samui the fate of other tropical paradises.
Perhaps it did not have the rice-paddy vistas of Bali or Goa's air
connections to Europe, or maybe tourists to Thailand found it hard to
get beyond the randy bars of Bangkok's Patpong or the nearby Pattaya
beach.
Whatever the reason, Samui today offers a delightful escape for
tourists seeking an unspoilt tropical destination combined with a
comfortable bed, interesting food, and a little nightlife, all at a
reasonable price.
There is a remarkable range of hotels, from two five-star places at
#200 a night to the simple beach bungalows, now starting at #5. At the
former you'll find air-conditioning, 24-hour room service, and satellite
TV, at the latter a fan if you're lucky. But nowhere does it seem
crowded, and there is no clash between those who fall asleep between
fine cotton sheets and those whose lullaby is the sound of the waves.
If people meet up it's at the airport, where the Bangkok Airways
terminal buildings have thatched roofs, or at one of the handful of
shanty-towns that lie behind the island's long, white beaches. The best
known is Chaweng, where a strip of small resorts has grown up between a
dusty road and the beach. Here there is a bungalow or small hotel for
every pocket, including the new Poppies, a Thai version of the popular
Poppies at Kuta Beach on Bali.
Poppies combines a high standard of style and comfort with a small
hotel experience right on the beach. Each suite is a Thai-style bungalow
built around a peaceful garden with streams and rock formations. The sea
is wonderful for swimming, while Thai women offer massages on the beach.
Winter here is not hard to take.
At night tourists hop on the ''baht buses'', pick-up trucks with
benches, and ride into Chaweng where they pay the driver 10 baht, less
than 40 pence. If the seats are full you just stand on the tailgate and
hang on to an overhead bar at the back. Such a mode of travel makes for
a sense of shared adventure with other riders, which results in Swiss
bankers and Canadian engineers drinking amiably in pubs that look as if
they were knocked together from driftwood the day before.
The same goes for the restaurants and nightclubs, giving Chaweng a
faintly seedy but happily casual feel. The inevitable vendors selling
knock-off brand-name clothing and watches don't have the persistence of
the pests on Bali, and sickness seems rare, one reason being that
although Samui only has a septic-tank system, no waste goes into the
sea.
The biggest danger to tourists here is road accidents. Many rent small
motorcycles for about #6 a day but bigger machines are available and few
questions are asked. One hotel manager watched a young visitor struggle
to get on a 750cc motorbike and concluded that the last two-wheeler he
had been on was a bicycle. This, combined with primitive roads, makes
accidents common. For the record, the second leading cause of visitor
fatalities is death by coconut. As a man in a bar said: ''This small
island harvests two million coconuts a year and some come down at the
most damnable times.''
For some men the only fright they will get is at the Green Mango night
club, where in the half light it's hard to tell the gender of their
dancing partners. Down the street, the Taeng Corner is less subtle.
Here, amid flashing lights and rock 'n' roll, transvestite barmen (or
''ladymen'') are fond of undressing each other to demonstrate ingenious
surgery.
Other bars have more pedestrian lures such as live soccer via
satellite, and at one -- it might have been the Bulldog, GB 11, Cheers
or Hard Rock Cafe -- I watched the Scotland versus Wales rugby
international.
The drinker/spectator at my side, as it turned out, was a British
banker working in Singapore who was staying at Baan Taling Ngam and had
hopped on the hotel's shuttle bus for a night out in Chaweng. He'd had a
good meal of fresh fish then taken a stroll along the beach to check out
a friend's hotel. Amid the shacks, modest hotels and palms he was
surprised to come on a large construction site that is evolving into the
aptly-named Central Samui, a four-storey, 230-room hotel with all mod
cons, and presumably, tour buses and coconut monkey shows every hour on
the hour.
I'd go now while the going's good.

* INJURED sportsmen should welcome advances in repairing tendons which
are notoriously difficult to heal. A new tendon bandage is now being
developed using techniques discovered by Glasgow University researchers
investigating neural networks.
The bandages are composed of biodegradeable plastic with tiny grooves
etched upon the surface which diverts the growth of cells along them.
Working alongside Ethicon on the development of the bandage, the
university team hope to develop methods of encouraging the body to
perform its own tissue reconstruction rather than implant man-made
tissues.

* KNOW which fish has not had sex recently and you will be able to
choose the best quality. Skate, grey mullet, and bass have so far
abstained, according to Alan Watson (Galloway Smokehouses, Carsluith,
Newton Stewart), and are good quality.
Others may have lost up to half their body weight during spawning.
Flat fish, in particular, he says, are in poor condition. Crabs and
lobsters are in a much better state.
The first crop of Scottish-grown herb-greenery is now being harvested,
says Robert Wilson (Scotherbs, Waterybutts Grange, Errol,
Perthsire).This season's crop of mint, chives, oregano, thyme, tarragon,
flat-leaved parsley, rocket, sorrel, and basil has been grown in a
protective tunnel, but there have also been the first pickings of
Scottish lettuce grown outside.
From now on Scottish-grown salad vegetables will become more
available.

Hake is not an attractive fish, but Lady Claire MacDonald argues
that what it lacks in looks it makes up hamdsomely in flavour
when it presents itself on the plate
HAKE is a fish with which too few people are familiar. I first became
a fan of hake when we began to use it here at Kinloch on our menus, many
years ago. Hake is the classic example of how we shouldn't judge a thing
by its appearance. Seen whole, a hake is a menacingly unattractive fish,
and, years ago, our hake arrived with us as it had emerged from the sea.
The man who delivered our fish had a sense of humour (of a sort) and
he would line up the hake neatly, all facing forward. It's just as well
I have a stout heart when it comes to these sort of things, and Peter
Macpherson, with whom I've cooked happily these past 21 years, and I
would seize a hake in one hand a filleting knife in the other and set to
work. How spoilt we are these days with our hake and all our other fish,
with the exception of salmon, arriving conveniently filleted for us. And
it's just as well that when buying hake in fishmongers the prospective
customers aren't faced with the whole hake, because even fewer would buy
hake than do at present.
It can't be that there is a lack of hake, because we have never had
any difficulty in getting it, although admittedly we live almost
opposite Mallaig, and have an excellent fish supplier in Andy Race. I
have asked for hake on occasion in fish shops in Edinburgh and been told
that there is no demand for hake, but they could always order it for me
specially. So perhaps if more people asked for it regularly, fish shops
would stock hake, along with cod and haddock.
The reason I long for more people to buy and eat hake is that it is
such a delicious fish. I love cod -- and hake is a member of the cod
family -- but hake has a far closer texture than cod, and a far more
delicate flavour. Inside its drab and dull skin is a fishmeat with a
silvery broad strip down each side. Because the fish is closer textured
than cod it is more suited to stir-fried dishes. In such dishes cod
(when as fresh as it should be) readily falls into large juicy flakes as
soon as it is cooked, but chunks of hake hold their shape to a far
greater extent.
The flavour of hake is sweet, almost nutty. This description may seem
to border on the ridiculous when discussing fish, but taste hake and
you'll see what I mean. One of the best ways to cook hake is to dip
pieces of filleted fish in beaten egg then in pinhead oatmeal, and
shallow fry in butter with a small amount of sunflower oil. How long you
cook it depends on the size of the fish, but cook until the fish looks
opaque inside when you stick a fork and break into a piece. Turn it
over, and let it cook on each side. The pinhead oatmeal makes a far more
delicious coating than breadcrumbs. I love the crunchiness.
We serve this with a tartare sauce -- but not the type redolent of the
motorway service station restaurants, served in those individual
portions which are harder to get into than Fort Knox. True tartare sauce
is a most delicious sauce, with a good mayonnaise as its base and
containing chopped olives, capers, hardboiled egg, and plenty of parsley
and, if you like, garlic. If you prefer, you can substitute snipped
chives for garlic.
The only thing to beware of with hake served like this with tartare
sauce is that together they are very filling. Potatoes are rarely
needed. Stir-fried sugarsnap peas, with a small amount of ginger and
sliced spring onions, and a salad, make perfect vegetable
accompaniments. Hake fillets can be baked in a bed of parsley, with bits
of butter and grated lemon over them, then with the dish sealed -- this
is perfect when cooked in microwave oven -- the fish steams on its bed
of parsley.
You can serve any sauce you like with this fish, which should be
carefully lifted off its parsley bed on to serving plates. I like to
make a creamy sauce using egg yolks, butter, milk, more grated lemon
rind and mustard powder -- you don't notice the mustard, but it does
give the sauce a more interesting taste.
With all these ingredients -- to the ratio of two yolks to 2oz butter,
[1/2] pint of milk and 1 teaspoon mustard, and one lemon's rind -- all
whizzed together until smooth, then heated in a bowl over a pan of
simmering water until thick, then lastly a couple of tablespoons of
chopped parsley and snipped chives stirred in just before serving, you
have a sauce which is convenient in that it can be made at your leisure
and not at the last minute, as well as a sauce which both looks and
tastes good.
HAKE WITH TOMATOES, BLACK OLIVES, AND BASIL
* HERE is a favourite recipe of mine for an easily and quickly
prepared summer dish using hake.
Serves 4-6, depending on appetites. It is very good served cold, in
which case I gently -- so as not to break up the pieces of fish -- stir
in a couple of extra tablespoons of the best olive oil when it's cold.
2lb hake filleted, felt all over for bones and any bones removed, and
the hake cut into chunks about 1"
4 tablespoons good extra-virgin olive-oil
2 medium onions, skinned and sliced finely
1 large garlic clove (leave this out if you prefer) skinned and
chopped finely
8 tomatoes, skinned, each cut in half and the seeds scooped out, then
the halved tomatoes cut into four or six thin wedges
a handful fresh basil
salt and pepper to your taste.
Heat the oil in a large saute or frying pan and cook the sliced onions
until they are really soft and just beginning to turn golden. Add the
chopped garlic and the fish, and cook until the pieces of fish turn
opaque, about 3-5 minutes dependng on the width of your saute or frying
pan. Then stir in the sliced tomatoes and the stones and chopped black
olives. Just before serving tear up the basil leaves and stir them in.
If you add them too soon they lose their flavour in the heat.
This is good with either new potatoes, or with plain boiled basmati
rice.

Ken Gallacher reflects on the diverse influences that shaped clarinet
giants Bob Wilber and Kenny Davern
BY SOME strange quirk of fate -- helped by a little local difficulty
-- those two mainstream clarinet giants Bob Wilber and Kenny Davern will
be playing this week on consecutive nights in Nairn and Inverness.
Moves to pair the two in their classic Summit Reunion group fell apart
when the Inverness promoters decided they wanted nothing to interfere
with their Davern solo concert on May 31.
The previous night, May 30, Wilber will be at Nairn with his
London-based group: Mik Pyne on piano, Dave Cliff, guitar, Dave Green,
bass, and Bobby Worth drums. Then at Inverness Davern will be the
follow-up attraction backed by a Scottish rhythm section. Those of us
who are devotees of Summit Reunion will have to wait until the Edinburgh
Jazz Festival to see the two men perform together.
In the meantime, this week will be enough to whet the appetite for the
summer and to confirm that the clarinet, an instrument which has been
shamefully neglected in most of modern jazz, has a rich and continuing
tradition.
Davern will stress that most of all, having abandoned all other reed
instruments to concentrate solely on the instrument he fell in love with
after listening to a Pee Wee Russell solo on Memphis Blues when he was
in his teens.
Since that day Davern has gone by way of Russell, shunning the Goodman
approach that most clarinet players have followed. He is no clone, no
mere copyist, but has grown into one of the most distinctive voices in
the music business.
Where the Russell influence is most obvious is in the use of a
''dirty'' tone and the quite extraordinary squawks which are often heard
in his most emotive solos. And like the man who was his New York mentor,
Davern takes chances. No cliches for him, and little coasting, as he
goes about his life's work.
He learned the hard way, mind you. Playing around New York when a
fierce competitive streak ran through the jazz world, and when he found
himself one night standing next to Coleman Hawkins on the raised stage
behind the bar at the Metropole on Broadway.
He recalls now: ''I was standing there at the end of the stage, I
think Red Allen was leading the band and he had asked me along to play.
Red and I shared the same birth date and he used to encourage me; to
look out for me really. Anyhow, there I was, nervous enough being up
there with a whole gang of jazz legends, and then out of the corner of
my eye I saw someone else coming on to the stand. I felt this presence
and I was too scared to look round properly, but I knew it was Hawk.
''God, I didn't know what to do. I was too scared to play!''
Another time while he was playing at the Ferryboat Club in Brielle,
New Jersey, along with pianist Dik Wellstood and trombonist Eddie
Hubble, Davern asked Russell to take over for one night while he played
another job.
Pee Wee did so and, in the process, carved the younger man to shreds.
Says Davern: ''I got back from my other gig early and went along to see
how Pee Wee was doing. I wish I had not done that. At the end I got up
on to the stand with him and we started to play a blues number and he
cut me to ribbons. In front of my friends, my fellow musicians and the
audience. It was terrible.
''Going back to the city I asked him why he had done that to me and he
replied: 'You put me on the spot, chum. I had to do it.' What Russell
meant was that he had a reputation to defend, and he simply responded to
the challenge.
It was in situations like those that Davern learned his trade. After a
spell where he played soprano sax along with Wilber in the original
Soprano Summit group, which lasted through the l970s, he decided on the
clarinet-only approach he persists with to this day. He is a complete
original, with a sound which is utterly unmistakable. The good people of
Inverness are in for a treat . . .
As are the citizens of Nairn, when Bob Wilber appears there. His
career has been intertwined with that of Davern for the last 25 years or
so. But earlier they took seperate paths to jazz greatness.
Wilber began as a pupil of Sidney Bechet, and as a youngster he
eventually sounded so uncannily like his teacher on soprano saxophone
that the trombonist George Brunies nicknamed them ''Bash and Shay''.
By the time he came to Britain for the first time with the Eddie
Condon All Stars in 1957, he was playing a Goodman-inspired clarinet.
Ten years later with the World's Greatest Jazz Band he was back playing
soprano, but one with a difference. This was the small, curved
instrument, and on that he evoked memories of Johnny Hodges when he
played soprano with the Duke Ellington Orchestra.
Now, while Davern plays one horn only, Wilber spreads himself. The
last time I saw him, just over a year ago, he played clarinet, tenor,
alto, and both straight and curved soprano. He remains a master on all
of them.
It's just a pity that we must wait until August before we can hear
their contrasting styles on the same bandstand and in the same group.
Still, this week is good enough to be going on with, and Ken Ramage has
to be congratulated on his single-handed efforts to present jazz in
Nairn on a regular basis. There will be more on this Norman Granz of the
north at a later date . . .

They might provide welcome shelter in a storm but, for Bruce Sandison
there are certain dangers attached to the bothy
I AM going to regret saying this, but I have mixed feelings about
mountain bothies. To me they are unwelcome ''focal points'', magnetising
public attention on some of Scotland's most fragile areas. It could be
argued that by writing about these places I am equally guilty, but
bothies relentlessly concentrate the mind and many walkers plan their
expeditions round bothy locations. Consequently, the very thing which
draws us to the hills, silence and solitude, is degraded.
A ruined croft building near to where I live, Tongue in north-west
Sutherland, has recently been upgraded and made into a bothy. The
surrounding hills are modest, easily accessible from the road, and I
have walked this way for years without seeing another soul. Now, the
yellow-cagoule pack are appearing in ever increasing numbers and only
because of the presence of this bothy.
There may be some rationale for a bothy at the end of a gut-bursting
hike into the wilds, although I don't think so, but what is the point of
a bothy 15 minutes from a main road? Even more pointless when you
consider that there is an excellent Youth Hostel by the Kyle of Tongue
and inexpensive accommodation of all kinds, including a camp-site, in
the township itself.
This is not to denigrate the work of organisations like the Mountain
Bothy Association (MBA). They are motivated by the highest ideals:
companionship, courtesy, and respect for individual rights; and MBA
members give unstintingly of their time and labour on behalf of others.
The problem lies not in the work of the MBA, but in how others use, or
more frequently misuse, the facilities which the association provide.
Be that as it may, I would be the first to admit that I have tumbled
gratefully into the shelter of a bothy on a stormy day, thankful for the
comfort it provided, and I suppose bothies have a part to play in ''the
large religion'' of the hills. My only concern is that bothies might
become the first step down the path to the provision of ''proper
facilities'' in the wilderness.
The work of the MBA was featured some years ago in the series
''Discover Scotland'', published by the Sunday Mail, including details
and a photograph of A'Chuil bothy in Glendessarry, one of the few
bothies I have visited. My wife and I stumbled upon it while tramping
the hills to the south of the River Dessarry which drains into the head
of Loch Arkaig.
It was raining. After all, it was Lochaber, and Lochaber has one of
the highest rainfall levels in Scotland; but it was decent,
user-friendly rain, interspersed with bouts of warm sunshine and we were
having a splendid day. Most walkers here make for the heady heights of
Sgurr na Ciche (3412ft). We were intent upon an easy ridge walk, from
Carn Mor (2720ft), east by Meall nan Spardan (2132ft) to Monadh Gorm
(1568ft); overlooking the spot where supporters of Bonnie Prince Charlie
chucked barrels of French gold into Loch Arkaig in 1746.
And if you believe that you will believe anything. I know my Highland
lairds, and the possibility of them passing up the chance of an easy
buck, then or now, beggars belief. A similar story is told about Loch
Hakel in Sutherland, also involving barrels of French gold. The thing
these stories have most in common is that not a penny piece of treasure
was ever recovered.
I have no regard for BPC but he must have had strong lungs and a great
pair of legs. The area is littered with memorials to places where he hid
or slept: on Sgurr na Ciche; above Glenfinnan; in a cave on Sail
Chaorainn (3287ft); various other points east, west and south. Given the
number of locks of hair and bits of his kilt he left behind as presents
BPC must have arrived back in France bald and bollock naked.
The summit of Carn Mor is one of the finest viewpoints in Lochaber and
on a clear day an unforgettable experience. The four-mile walk east to
Monadh Gorm extends this pleasure mightily; easy going over peat and
heather tussocks with green Glendessarry to the north and the silver
ribbon of the River Pean to the south. Bog cotton whispers in the wind
by tiny, dark pools and the only difficulty is negotiating the forest
fence across the hill beyond Meall nan Spardan.
The descent from Monadh Gorm to the farm at Strathan and Loch Arkaig
is steep and tiresome and should be approached with caution,
particularly in wet or misty conditions. Once down, the crystal water of
the River Dessarry offers refreshment fit for a king and, no doubt, in
times past, a recalcitrant, fugitive prince.

ON the west end of Canna, with the long island laid on the luminous
western ocean and a huge blue sky overhead, we saw a ghost. In the
widest view in Scotland, space was defined by a great shadow gliding
without a flap 500ft above us. An eight-foot wingspan, a squared
trailing edge to the wings, a heavy billed head, a white wedge of a
tail: this is an Erne. This is its story.
The Sea Eagle was reputedly commoner than its golden cousin once -- as
a maritime scavenger among maritime clans, this may have been an
illusion. It was the ''wet winged eagle'' of the ninth-century poem, The
Seafarer, the ''grey-feathered, white-tailed eagle'' ripping the Viking
corpses after Brunanburh in 937. Its persecution came to the Highlands,
like the Clearances, with the sheep. The gentleman collectors of the
Victorian sporting estates did the rest. Scottish Ernes had an albino
gene: Charles St John saw a ''fine silvery-white corpse'' in 1848 and
one of the last Shetland pair in 1908 was white. But the last pair bred
in Skye in 1916. An authority on eagles wrote in 1955: ''We used to have
the Erne in Britain, but I have never seen one, except in the zoo.''
Yet we saw the ghost on Canna. For since 1975 between four and 10
Norwegian eaglets have been released each year on Rum. By 1983 they were
attempting to breed and a decade later eight pairs raised five eaglets.
Once again, from the newly empty coasts of the Hebrides, Ernes can be
seen tumbling in display with talons locked, or soaring on wings like
barn doors. And yet a gene pool has dried: if a white eagle had sailed
above us as we crawled across the island, it would truly have been the
ghost of something gone.

As the wild spaces of Scotland come under ever increasing threat from
over use and restrictive land ownership, the Rambler's Association is
fighting for freedom to roam. Peter Evans looks at its important role in
the outdoor movement and the determination which has made it a
formidable pressure group
ROWS of bobble-hatted clones dressed in orange anoraks, second pair of
socks rolled down neatly over the tops of their walking boots, striding
out along the lanes of the English Lake District, no doubt reciting The
Daffodils as they go. It's a common conception people have of ramblers.
In Scotland in particular, those who think of themselves as dedicated
mountaineers -- true men and women of the mountains -- place ramblers in
a different category altogether, drawing a bold demarcation line and
maintaining as much distance as possible.
It's a distinction of which Dave Morris was only too well aware when
he took the job as Scottish Officer for the Ramblers' Association in
1989. ''I was conscious when I first started that the word 'rambling'
was perceived as a term used in England, or southern Britain,'' says
Morris, whose own mountaineering pedigree includes trips to the
Himalayas as well as many years of climbing in Scotland.
He is scathing of the stereotype, arguing that rambling is ''walking
in all environments'', and pointing to the solid historical connections
the term has north of the Border. He stressed the important role Scots
had in the development of the outdoor movement in the 1930s, when there
was a Scottish Ramblers' Federation. Well before that, in 1892, a West
of Scotland Ramblers' Alliance had been formed.
Whatever anyone's perception of the typical rambler, there is no doubt
that the Ramblers' Association is one of the most powerful pressure
groups in Britain it comes to fighting for the interests of walkers and
promoting their enjoyment of the countryside -- a collective voice to be
reckoned with.
A head office in London and a well-oiled publicity machine make sure
the clarion call is heard in Parliament whenever the need arises.
Outside London, an extensive web of local groups -- 36 of them in
Scotland -- ensures the association's interests are well served; and
1995 is an important year for grassroots activity. To mark its 60th
anniversary, the RA has chosen to ''encourage and facilitate campaigning
at group level'', as David Morris puts it.
The RA's autonomous presence in Scotland took a big step forward in
1981 with the establishment of Ramblers' Association Scotland. A
Scottish Council now meets annually, when policy making is determined by
the Scottish membership, currently numbering almost 5000. Membership of
the RA as a whole stands at more than 100,000 had has doubled in the
last 10 years. Though still relatively small, Scottish membership more
than quadrupled in the same period, so there is a growing presence north
of the Border.
Some notable victories have been chalked up. Last year, RA campaigning
led to the abandonment of the sale of public forest areas near Glasgow,
and the association played a prominent role in the campaign to block the
Government's forestry privatisation programme.
Plans to extend the Ministry of Defence firing range in the Pentland
hills, on the outskirts of Edinburgh, which would have meant
restrictions for walkers, were defeated in 1990.
''Of increasing significance has been the protection of our finest
scenery,'' says the RA. That has involved restraining the extension of
downhill skiing in the Cairngorms and, more recently, giving evidence at
the Stornoway public inquiry in opposition to the ''Harris Hole'' -- the
giant superquarry proposal by Redland Aggregates for Lingerbay, which
has torn the local community assunder.
One of the most prominent achievements to date was the signing of the
Letterewe Accord at the end of 1993. An agreement drafted by Morris, in
consultation with other Scottish outdoor and conservation bodies, it
stands as a model of successful negotiation between a landowner and
those who want to use his land for recreation.
At the beginning of 1991, signs began appearing on the Letterewe
Estate, a magnificent mountainous area of wild land around Loch Maree,
asking walkers to confine themselves to certain footpaths. There was
also a proposal for a new estate track which worried conservationists.
After an initial approach to the estate's Dutch owner, Paul van
Vlissingen, meetings were held over a period of two years, and the
accord finally struck. It was rightly hailed as a breakthrough in the
often fraught relations between landowners and the outdoor lobby, and is
still a unique example of what can be achieved when opposing parties sit
down together to resolve the problems.
Fundamental to the agreement is the recognition that since the rural
environment is under growing pressure, ''a new approach is needed,''
involving ''co-operation between individual and community interests in
the sound management of wild land''.
Based firmly on the Scottish tradition of ''freedom to roam'', it
allows walkers access to all the estate's land, with agreed
qualifications for conservation and management. ''There is nothing said
that you should confine your walking to the footpaths,'' says Morris.
''What we are trying to do now is to establish a positive attitude among
walkers going to the estate so management of the land is understood.''
For his part, Paul van Vlissigen had this to say when the agreement
was signed: ''The accord is a very positive and realistic step forward.
It is a recognition on the side of the landower that if you are talking
about wild land, you can't say it is land you own in the way you own a
kitchen garden.''
Despite the significance of the accord, Morris emphasises: ''We do not
intend to go from estate to estate across Scotland negotiating these
agreements. The next stage is to establish those principles across
Scotland as a whole.''
To that end, discussions started mid-way through last year to frame a
''Concordat for the Hills'' are now nearing completion. Representatives
of outdoor bodies, local authorities, the Scottish Sports Council,
landowning interests and the Association of Deer Management Groups have
all taken part in the talks, presided over by Magnus Magnusson, chairman
of Scottish Natural Heritage.
Morris and the RA want to see the principle of freedom to roam ''on
the hill, in the forest and across agricultural land'' enshrined in law,
with certain safeguards. These include acting responsibly and not doing
damage, not invading privacy or entering areas where there is a special
conservation or security problem.
''We would anticipate this type of legislation coming in with a change
of government,'' says Morris, pointing to positive commitments from both
Labour and the SNP. ''Even in a position of a Conservative Government
continuing in office for many years, I would see legislation coming
about.''
He admits that ''about 40'' peers sitting in the House of Lords who
own land in Scotland would be a significant barrier, but argues that
there are too many votes to be gained from improving the access laws for
the barrier to be effective.
Arrangements with landowners like the Letterewe Accord are ''all very
well when particular people are sitting round a table together, but they
are not in any way binding on new landowners,'' says Morris. ''We do
need a framework of legislation to deal with those who are not willing
to follow the voluntary code.''
This is the Ramblers' Association at its most contentious and
political on a national scale. The main thrust of Jubilee year in 1995
is for members at grassroots level to get things done.
By the end of next month, the whole of the Fife Coast from the Forth
Bridge to the Tay Bridge wil have been walked by sections of RA members.
The object is to focus the attention of local authorities on any
obstacles en route so the quality of the coastal walk, which takes in
some impressive seascapes, can be improved.
Coastal and riverside walking have been singled out for special
attention as general themes. Whereas fishermen often have access to
sections of river bank on the great Scottish rivers like the Don and the
Dee, things can be difficult for walkers, says Morris.
''There are very few opportuniites to walk significant lengths of the
Dee unless you are particularly determined. North of Perth on the Tay,
there is some superb riverside walking you can see from the A9, but you
never see anyone walking along it.''
The health benefits of walking are also being stressed, and given a
disturbingly high level of heart disease and lack of exercise among
Scots, the message is especially poignant. Although it is estimated that
more than two million countryside and coastal walks are taken in
Scotland weekly, the figure is boosted significantly by visitors. Half
the population rarely, or never, goes walking.
Yet there are definite benefits to physical wellbeing. Regular, brisk
walking reduces blood pressure and keeps it down; lowers the level of
harmful cholesterol in the blood; tones up the body's muscles while, at
the same time, averting aching joints and potential bone problems.
Dave Morris and I improved our health a little by going for a short
walk when I interviewed him at Kinnesswood in Fife. It gave him the
opportunity to point out some local conservation and access problems,
multiplied in communities all around Scotland.
We stood on the edge of a field system next to the derelict shell of a
farm vehicle. The only other litter we saw on the walk was plastic bags,
again left by a farmer -- so irresponsible walkers are not the only
people who litter the countryside. The fields had no walkable paths
around them.
''We need a completely new system of legislation to secure walking
routes,'' says Morris. ''Existing rights of way legislation is decrepit,
and the proposals on the table from the Scottish Rights of Way
Association and Scottish Natural Heritage will not address that problem.
We are arguing that you have a right to walk on footpaths and that they
are kept clear and in good condition.'' He also wants to see walking
targeted as a major objective of public subsidy.
Dave Morris pulls no punches in promoting the principles of the
Ramblers' Association. It's an uphill struggle, and there are those who
would privately like to see him burned at the stake and his ashes
scattered to the winds. But he's not going to go away, and neither is
his organisation. The next battle is always just around the corner . . .
Like the one to save the London to Fort William sleeper service, which
had been set to end from tomorrow until an action by Highland Regional
Council at the Court of Session in Edinburgh succeeded in preventing the
closure.
At its National Council meeting at Warwick University in April, the RA
called on the Government to instruct British Rail to keep the service
operational until a public consultation exercise over its future could
take place.
The Ramblers' case was based partly on the value of the service for
walking excursions from stations between Glasgow and Fort William,
highlighted in a book by Chris and John Harvey, proprietors of a Loch
Lomondside guesthouse.
The Harveys are in their sixth season at Tarbet House, situated high
above the loch, with panoramic views across the water. Originally from
Cheshire, they came to Loch Lomond from East Anglia, where John was a
university lecturer. Both still lecture part-time at Open University as
well as running the guesthouse.
They wanted somewhere which provided opportunities for mountain
activities and sailing, and after loking at other parts of the country,
they decided Scotland was the place. ''We decided it had so much more to
offer,'' said John.
The idea for a book linked to the railway line came from a similar
situation in northern England several years ago, when the scenic line
from Settle to Carlisle was saved from closure. The Ramblers'
Association was involved in that campaign, too.
Chris and John approached publishers with their project and got a good
response. They set about looking at Ordnance Survey maps and existing
books and things began to take shape. ''We tried to identify what walks
there were between stations or from a station and back to it,'' said
John.
ScotRail offered free travel while the Harveys were testing the
routes, which took two years, with the walking done in the winter, since
the guesthouse occupied the couple's time during the rest of the year.
The end result Walks from the West Highland Railway, containing more
than 40 excursions from stations between Helensburgh, Fort William and
Oban. Most of the walks can be completed within a day's return rail
travel from Glasgow Queen Street station.
Most passengers travelling the line will view the scenery from the
train. What the Harvey's book does is provide detailed information and
guidance on experiencing it in the raw. The routes range from relatively
gentle walks to more challenging outings taking in Munro summits.
Indeed, those looking to increase their tally of Munros will find 18
listed in the book.
Research has been thorough and the guide is practical, without being
spartanly utilitarian. Each walk is graded from ''easy'' to ''serious'',
there are details of length, ascent, the type of terrain covered, access
and refreshments. In addition, the Harveys have added information on
geology, history, industrial archaeology, natural history and folklore.
There are maps to accompany the walks and the book contains pictures
taken by Chris and John themselves. ''It was a very worthwhile project
which we enjoyed doing,'' said John.
The Harveys and the RA would like to see ScotRail promoting the West
Highland line much more actively. John Harvey argues that ScotRail must
work together with the tourist authorities in this, and Dave Morris
believes there is a vast, largely untapped, market south of the Border.
With a little thought and planning, a fascinating and varied holiday
could be constructed around the book, using the railway to move on to
different stations and doing the walks suggested.
Britain Rail say the sleeper service, which has been running since
1901, loses #2.5m a year, and Lord Kirkwood's judgment may yet prove
only a temporary reprieve. But the fate of the Settle-Carlisle line
looked equally bleak, and efforts have been made to promote it since it
was saved.
Walkers are an often underestimated resource at times like these.
Inventive marketing and an enlightened approach could make all the
difference between lossses and profits. Dave Morris, Sue and John Harvey
will be watching what happens with interest.

Julie Davidson finds that a walk on the wild side can be a calming
experience
BY tradition and reputation the Scottish walker is a taciturn
creature; dour on the hills, sociable in grunts, reluctant to share the
solitude of the wilderness with anything more garrulous than the odd
whaup. But the growing popularity of walking as a pastime has forced the
reclusive rambler into a new freemasonry.
Only the most committed churl will refuse to swop hellos and trade
information with other consumers of the countryside when face to face on
a narrow path. I met one pupil of that surly school on Ben Alligin in
Wester Ross recently, and a host of friendlier types in Perthshire the
other weekend. And although I like my landscapes lonely and rarely have
the breath for vivacious gossip I know which I prefer.
The ramblers' club concept may seem a contradiction in terms for those
who walk to escape from people, but sharing the steep path to the top of
Ben Vrackie with some happy wanderers from Paisley made me conscious of
its benefits. Their age profile was mature; their levels of fitness
visibly varied; but they nursed each other along with good heart and
generous spirit, and they were clearly having fun.
All over Perthshire on that warm Saturday there were people having
picnics in car-parks; people who don't explore the countryside on foot
because, perhaps, they don't know how to set about it and -- cowed by
the doomy propaganda of the wilderness managers -- they are too timid to
try. For such people the ramblers' club brings liberation, and the
organised walking holiday the thrill of discovery. Here are some
pointers to operators who run programmes for clubbable walkers:
HF Guided Walking Hoidays: the most comprehensive. Something for every
social permutation and level of experience, including singles, twenties,
families, house-party holidays and gentle walks for the over-70s,
''Challenger'' routes and winter hillwalking throughout the UK. They
also hoof it in Europe, North America, Ecuador, New Zealand and
Australia, and have a programme dedicated to Britain's long-distance
routes. Brochures on 0181 905 9388.
English Wanderer: small-scale, specialist company offering guided and
independent routes in the UK, Brittany and Ireland (where they have the
sense to call their tours Irish Roamer, likewise here there's Scottish
Wanderer). Hotel and country inn accommodation, luggage transported.
Brochure on 01740 653169.
Countrywide Walking Holidays: special interest weeks centred on nine
guest houses. This summer's programme includes ''Daphne Du Maurier's
Cornwall'', based at Fowey, with undemanding walks on the moorland,
coastal and smugglers' paths which the writer explored. No more than six
miles a day guaranteed. Further information on 0161 255 1000.Backroads:
ambitious worldwide programme which will take you hiking (or mountain
biking) up the Canadian Rockies, across the Holy Land, into the rain
forests of Costa Rica and Belize, round the islands of Bali and New
Zealand's South, through the Arizona desert and the canyons of Utah.
Softies can stick to Tuscany, the Dordogne and the Cotswolds. Brochure
on 01425 655022.
Crystal Holidays: ''Hikers Heaven'' programme specialises in Austria,
where walking was invented and patented and hut-to-hut touring is the
classic way to go. Austria's 1000-plus mountain huts don't compare with
the Scottish bothy; most have hot showers and many have restaurants.
Book through Crystal's Lakes and Mountains brochure (hikers' hotels also
available) or get more details on 0181 399 5144.
And finally . . . a walk to serious purpose. Go pub-crawling round
Belfast with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, who offer routes to
some of the city's most famous boozers. Each guided tour lasts about two
hours and features five pubs and, by definition, five pints of Guinness.
General information on Northern Ireland holidays on 0800 282662.
* MARKETING'S the thing. Greaves Travel, who specialise exclusively in
India, have devised an elegant way to promote their tailor-made
itineraries on the sub-continent. Not for them the free brochure, but
the free travel guide. A Journey Through India is an 84-page digest of
India's most conspicuous attractions, printed on quality paper and
illustrated with sumptuous photographs.
Mehra Dalton, Greaves' managing director, explains its purpose with a
compliment to potential customers: ''The experienced traveller reads
books, not tour brochures. At the top end of the market we find we never
sell an itinerary as it stands. Everyone wants something a little
different. By reading the book the customer can decide first and then
let Greaves organise their trip.''
Budget holidays these ain't, but budget browsing is within the reach
of every pocket. Copies of A Journey through India on 0171 487 5687.
* MARKETING'S the thing. When ITT Sheraton bought Ciga's failing
hotels last year they wasted no time restructuring the management of
these gorgeous properties and within months launched ''The Luxury
Collection'', 48 worldwide hotels which group top-of-the-range Sheratons
with the best of Ciga. A series of promotions has followed, including .
. .
Seven-night packages to the Hotel Excelsior on Venice Lido with free
sports throughout the season. Half-board rates from around #835 per
person; golf, tennis, sailing and windsurfing on offer. Similar packages
available from #535 at the Lido's Hotel des Bains (not one of the Luxury
Collection, but still pretty smart). Prices exclude flights.
Special offers at the Collection's Sardinian properties on the Costa
Smeralda. Three nights' full board at the hotels Romazzino and Cala di
Volpe include tennis and water skiing (coaching available), hire car and
a boat for the day with  picnic lunch. Prices from #522 to #786 per
person, excluding flights. Available until June 17, and from September
17 to October 1.

It may not have been the setting for a
Jane Austen novel, but the Glasgow in
which he grew up was very different from
the one portrayed in more recent, prize
winning works, recalls Chaim Bermant
DURING a recent visit to Glasgow, I read two Glasgow novels. The
first, Swing Hammer Swing, won the Whitbread; the other, How Late It
Was, How Late, the Booker. Both are grim, but the first brought out the
stoicism, geniality, and native wit of the Glaswegian, the second only
conveyed squalor.
The first is a great book, the second only sensational. It has
originality and power but it does not amount to a novel, and certainly
not to a great novel, and I suspect it won the Booker partly because the
literary world needs a Lower Depths to confirm its vision of a depraved
humanity which, by common consent, is to be found in Glasgow.
I spent my formative years in Glasgow, and though I could not imagine
it as the setting for a Jane Austen novel, I found it almost
oppressively genteel, with more than a passing resemblance to Muriel
Spark's Edinburgh. I even had my very own Jean Brodie in the person of
Miss Alison Kidd, a formidable but elegant English teacher at Queen's
Park School, who pro-noun-ced Eng-lish with the pre-cis-ion common only
among Scots. She introduced me to English literature and encouraged my
first forays into English writing.
We lived in Battlefield (named after the battle of Langside), a fairly
drab area on the South Side of the city which, on Saturday afternoons,
quaked with roars from Hampden Park, about a mile down the road. My
father had a working-class income and middle-class aspirations, and our
neighbours were mostly artisans, clerks, commercial travellers, and
petty traders.
The whole neighbourhood was composed of four-storied tenements. Homes
were small, cramped, but well-kept, with brightly polished nameplates,
neat lace curtains, with sun-blinds half drawn -- against an absent sun
-- to keep the carpets from fading. Every livingroom seemed to have a
display cabinet of fine china, which was brought out for Sunday
afternoon tea-parties, with home-made scones and bannocks and crumpets,
and home-made jam.
There were few private gardens but the city abounded, and abounds, in
open spaces: Queen's Park, Maxwell Park, Linn Park, Glasgow Green and
Kelvingrove, Rouken Glen and Hogganfield Loch -- each with their
particular attraction. One had golf, another a boating lake, a third a
museum, a fourth an art gallery. Some had tearooms; all had tennis
courts and bandstands.
We were given coupons at school, which enabled us to attend the weekly
concerts of the Scottish National Orchestra for a shilling. They were
always packed, and anyone anxious to attend a performance of the Messiah
or St Matthew Passion had to book weeks ahead. I could never get tickets
to the celebrated, but now defunct, Glasgow Orpheus Choir, because they
only seemed to circulate among an inner circle of devotees.
Glasgow had its drinking dens and its drunks, but we lived in what was
called a dry burgh, which is to say it didn't even have a licensed
grocer, and as a city it was famous for its tearooms: Cooper's, Reids,
Peacocks, Skinners, Fullers. There were also a number of Italian cafes
-- or cafys, as we called them -- which offered a quality of ice-cream I
have not found anywhere else in Britain.
I saw Glasgow as a seat of learning. The old university, established
in 1451, moved to its new home in Gilmorehill in 1870. It is a
neo-Gothic building, designed by Gilbert Scott, and glowers down upon
the city like a grey St Pancras. Below it is the Glasgow Art Gallery, a
baroque pile of red sandstone, and half-hidden in a narrow cobbled
street are the many splendours of Charles Rennie Mackintosh's art
school. Round the corner from the art school was the Cosmo -- since
renamed the Glasgow Film Theatre -- where one could see the best
continental films in congenial company and comfortable surroundings.
The Gorbals, by lore, was still intact, and the memories of pre-war
razor gangs. A rather sordid play called The Gorbals Story and Arthur
Bliss's ballet, Miracle of the Gorbals, gave it a certain notoriety as
the home of murder and mayhem. It was, so to speak, the native quarter
of the city, and visitors experienced a certain frisson when they toured
it by night.
To me, Gorbals was the place where we bought pickled herrings, Russian
bread, kosher chickens and cheesecake, and the home of the much-loved
Citizens' Theatre. My father was rabbi of one of the four local
synagogues -- all since demolished -- and never witnessed a violent
incident. I can recall only one. I went -- as befits a son of the manse
-- to the rescue of a young woman who seemed to be molested by a drunk,
and they both turned upon me, she with her handbag, he with his boots.
We were, of course, aware of the rougher, tougher, darker, deprived
Glasgow beyond our doors, but it had no fixed address and it didn't
define its basic character.
I finally left Glasgow in 1959, so all this is a tale of long ago, but
since then the city has acquired another two universities, a major new
art gallery -- the Burrell Collection -- an opera house and a new
concert hall, which is hardly evidence of cultural decline.
In the summer of 1981 almost every major city in Britain was shaken by
riots, and in every case the causes were ascribed to bad housing, high
unemployment, and a large immigrant influx. Glasgow had all three, yet
remained tranquil, which brings me to the most important thing about the
city: the friendliness, geniality, and warmth of its people.
Friendliness, geniality, and warmth, however, are not the stuff of
prize-winning novels. And neither, of course, is gentility.

Jim Hewitson reflects on the enduring ritual of ensuring the safety of
newborn lambs
THIS has to be the scariest time of year for a boy brought up among
the sandstone canyons of Clydebank, where the nearest we ever got to
nature was our neighbour sweeping up the horse apples for his allotment
after the scrappie's cairt passed by, or the buxom Mistress K, three
closes along, hinging, gloriously and enormously, from the windae to
watch the world go by.
Scary because here on the Atlantic edge lambs have started popping out
all over the place. Being so far north and having had a seemingly
endless winter, they wisely waited until the first half-hearted burst of
sunshine illuminated Papa Westray. Nature is now running riot, and
they're arriving in droves.
Signs of imminent lambing on our isle are familiar enough. Crofters
rush about the place peering over dikes; in the dead of night a strange,
brightly-lit UFO (unidentified farming object) creeps below the Smithy
Park (Neil on his night inspection); the ''backies'', the huge
black-backed gulls, hover over the field at Tirlo waiting to pick-off
the weaklings and wanderers (what was God thinking about when he created
these brutes?); the 24-hour rota for lamb watch is organised and
snatched sleep is now standard.
As we monitor the northern skies -- for the drenching, withering
showers can chill the life out of a new-born lamb -- it's a sobering yet
inspiring thought that this planning and anxiety must have been a part
of everyday life for our predecessors who watched their flocks on this
distant island, long before the Pyramids were built or Scotland was even
thought of.
From midden remains at stone-built settlements like Skara Brae on
mainland Orkney, and our own farmstead of the Knap of Howar -- the
oldest standing house in Northern Europe -- we know that sheep were
raised along with cattle and pigs.
Viking arrivals 1000 years ago found numerous flocks dispersed around
the Orkney archipelago, and are likely to have brought some of their own
sheep with them. Wool combs were discovered in Viking graves. By the
1500s, Orkney sheep had gained a reputation as fearful breeders -- two
or three lambs being commonplace, and four occasionally. A bit of
exaggeration here, methinks, as two are the norm today.
Monitoring the expectant ewes would have been as important 5000 years
ago as it is now. Too long between the rounds might result in a
''hanging'' case -- a lamb dead with only the head showing. If a good
milking ewe lost her lamb, the skin would be flayed and put on an orphan
lamb, which was then introduced to its new mother.
I also like to think that even without the benefit of glass bottles,
drenches, powdered milk, and plastic teats, some ''caddie'', or orphan
lambs, would have been reared by the fireside in these Stone Age
settlements as they are at School Place today.
Here on Papa Westray we have an added bonus. I only have to walk a few
hundred yards to step back 5000 years. On the island we have a flock of
North Ronaldsay sheep, the seaweed-eating ''Bussie broos'' -- scraggy,
self-reliant moutons who look as if they might be blown away by the
first zephyr. In fact they are the hardiest of creatures and, according
to the experts, probably very similar to the sheep of those Stone Age
farmers.
The most unkind of Papay's farmers suggest that some of the Hewitson
flock are so aged they must have experienced the Neolithic era at first
hand. We have no time for insults. A ''caddie'' lamb in a cardboard box
in front of the kitchen stove wants his tea.

A WRITER on antiques learns to be quite dispassionate about the
subject. Lovely paintings and exquisite pieces of furniture can be
described without evoking a twinge of covetousness. What's the point of
eating your heart out for a Monet at several million?
From time to time, however, a sale takes place that really makes my
mouth water, and one was held this week at Christie's in London's St
James. Entitled Visions of India, it was a selection of paintings and
drawings done by, or for, British people living in India before the
Mutiny of 1856.
For someone who spent a long time in India, the evocative power of the
pictures was heart- aching because in up-country regions the country has
changed little in 150 years. The second reason why the sale was so
appealing was because many of the lots were expected to fetch modest
prices. Now is the time to buy those Anglo-Indian pictures before they
start catching up with the huge sums paid for Rajput works.
There were three types of artists working in pre-mutiny India. First
came Indian artists who were commissioned by British people to draw and
paint pictures for them, and they produced the sort of works their
patrons wanted -- painstaking and full of local detail.
There was a particularly prolific school of artists in the town of
Lucknow, and they were selling pictures to foreigners, French or
British, around 1780. In Christie's there was a magnificent Lucknow
study of a stork, inscribed in French and Urdu.
In Mysore there was also a small collective of artists who produced
naive portraits of Europeans and native officials at the Maharajah's
court in the mid-nineteenth century. Over 800 of those portraits, some
of them of European women and children, as well as their menfolk, were
collected in an album for the Mysore Palace Library, and it came up for
sale with an estimate of between #20,000 to #30,000.
The Calcutta school was very prolific and thrived under the patronage
of Lady Impey, wife of an eighteenth century Chief Justice, who
commissioned studies of birds, animals and the local flora and fauna.
Birds were also painted by local artists to the order of an
end-of-the-century Commissioner of Police, Sir Henry Leland Harrison.
Other patrons were keen to buy local pictures of native people going
about their day-to-day tasks: making pots, sawing wood, growing hemp,
playing musical instruments -- tasks that are still performed today.
The second type of artists in India were professionals from home, who
went out in search of local colour or rich patrons. Typical of them was
William Daniell and his nephew Thomas.
William's career at home was not taking off in the way he had hoped,
so, in 1786, he and his 16-year-old nephew set sail for Calcutta with a
view to making drawings for a book of engravings entitled Views of
Calcutta. India claimed them as her own and they travelled the country
making a magnificent series of drawings and paintings.
Two of the most stunning in the sale were the younger Daniell's oil
painting of an Indian rhinoceros (estimate around #20,000) and his
uncle's oil study of an elephant fight in the compound of the Nawab of
Oudh (about #10,000). Their exquisite drawings of Indian temples and
buildings fetched more modest prices of between #200 and #500.
Other itinerant artists included George Chinnery, who divided his time
between Indian, Macao and Canton, making pencil sketches of things he
saw there, and Johann Zoffany, RA, who travelled in India, mainly around
Calcutta and Lucknow, between 1783 and 1789.
His paintings were rich in detail, and as full of people and incident
as Firth's study of Victorian England. An oil painting by Zoffany of an
Indian widow sacrificing herself on her husband's funeral pyre was
painted in a classical style and estimated at around #30,000.
The third sort of artist of India is, if anything, even more
interesting than the other two -- they were the British themselves: army
officers, their wives and daughters, box wallahs and their friends, who
sketched what they saw -- often with great wit, and sometimes with
malice. They were particularly good at making fun of their fellow
compatriots, who had not yet come to grips with the country.
One adept caricaturist was Sir Charles D'Oyly Bt, who was Collector in
Dacca between 1808 and 1818. One of his drawings showed a man in fancy
dress being hosed down by his servant ''dedicated to the Patronesses of
the May Ball'', while a neat drawing of a young Englishman having a
terrible time trying to get into a palanquin borne by ferociously
squinting natives, had an estimate of around #1500.
Other British works were studies of local scenery by men and women,
including D'Oyly, who were obviously entranced by the strange new
surroundings in which they found themselves.
Some of the artists, particularly army officers, were extremely
skilled, and they have left behind a magnificent record of what life was
like in that mysterious country so long ago.
MARKET TIP
TENNIS fans will be interested to know that Christie's are holding a
sale dedicated to the game in London on June 16, just in time for
Wimbledon. On offer are rackets dating from the 1870's to the 1930's,
memorabilia and books.

WILLIAM McCANCE was born in Cambuslang in 1894, the seventh of eight
children. He studied at Glasgow School of Art from 1911-15, then took a
teacher-training course at Glasgow's Kennedy Street School. Instead of
going into teaching he spent his next years in a more unexpected manner
-- in prison as a conscientious objector.
On his discharge in 1920, he and his wife, the artist Agnes Miller
Parker, moved to London. McCance did some teaching and also found
employment as an art critic, writing a regular column for the Spectator.
His paintings of the 1920s occupy a special place in Scottish art, for
McCance was one of the few Scottish artists of the period to have
responded with imagination and vigour to the cubist, abstract and
machine-age styles which spread throughout Europe after the war.
One of his most remarkable paintings of the early 1920s is Heavy
Structures in a Landscape Setting, a vision of futuristic weapons
contained within a very unusual seven-sided framing device. He also
painted portraits, many of which depict figures reading -- no doubt
reflecting the artist's passion for writing and book design. The Gallery
of Modern Art owns a portrait of Joseph Brewer, an American who also
worked for the Spectator magazine. Painted in vivid reds, greens, and
violets, Brewer assumes the appearance of a robot with gleaming, tubular
neck and neatly articulated, mechanistic hands.
Through his writing and painting, McCance came into contact with many
leading artists and writers, including Stanley Spencer, T E Lawrence,
Edwin Muir and Francis George Scott. Like Muir and Scott, McCance became
involved in the Scottish Renaissance movement, then being orchestrated
by Hugh MacDiarmid. MacDiarmid was immensely impressed by McCance's
work, and in the mid-1920s entered into regular correspondence with him,
praising him as the most ''advanced'' Scottish artist of his day.
In 1930 McCance became controller of the renowned Gregynog Press in
Wales. This small private press produced superb, limited-edition books
featuring original wood-engravings, inventive typography, and unusual
bindings. McCance resigned in 1933 and the couple moved to a converted
windmill at Albrighton, near Wolverhampton.
Due to the heavy workload at Gregynog, he had stopped painting, but at
Albrighton he returned to writing -- not only about art but also about
economic theory, a subject close to his heart. In 1944 he and Agnesmoved
to Reading, where McCance was appointed lecturer in Typography and Book
Production at the university.
After the war he embarked upon a new series of paintings, his first
since the 1920s. Just as Heavy Structures in a Landscape Setting had
been conceived as an anti-war statement, so his paintings of the
mid-1940s responded to the horrors of the Second World War.
In Hiroshima, a figure derived from one of his own sculptures reclines
in the foreground next to an egg and flint, while in the distance a
darkened sun hangs heavily over an apoclyptic landscape. A neolithic
Venus figure appears in the opposite corner, symbol of the birth of
civilisation, now facing its greatest threat.
McCance and Miller Parker separated in 1955. McCance's first major
solo exhibition was held at Reading Museum in 1960 and featured over 200
items. He retired that same year and in 1963, following his marriage to
Dr Margaret Chislett, a colleague at the university, moved back to
Scotland.
The sheer range of his activities -- painting, printmaking,
book-design, sculpture, art criticism, teaching, economics and politics
-- meant that his achievement was never easily quantifiable, and when he
died in 1970 his position as one of the foremost modern Scottish artists
had been largely forgotten.

THOSE cute little micro-organisms that clean up afer us, in our sewage
treatment plants, might be used to deal with toxic waste.
The bugs which eat their way through organic matter, reducing it to
simple molecules, in principle at least, should be able to dine on
effluents from chemical plants. Unfortunately, they don't, and toxic
compounds can pass through treatment plants and endanger aquatic life.
Andrew Livingston, a chemical engineer at Imperial College, London,
believes bacteria are simply lazy and dine mostly on simple compounds.
His idea is to give the micro-organisms a take-it-or-leave-it choice.
Eat or die.
If the bacteria are only fed toxic materials, then they might digest
them, and if kept captive where the waste is, they will acclimatise and
adapt to the new diet. Livingston has now designed a ''bioreactor''
which has achieved a 99% clean up of toxic compounds from real
industrial effluents. A pilot scale version is about to undergo trials
at industrial sites.
Other friendly little bugs could be used in making useful chemicals, a
project shows. Huddersfield researchers, linked with Allied Colloids,
have designed a bioreactor where bacteria are being used to produce
polymers.
The knowledge that organisms can be cajoled into working for the
benefit of humans has long been known and appreciated. Whisky,
distillers have for centuries been using yeasts in the fermentation
process. The yeasts eat sugars. What they excrete is alcohol. Very
obliging of them too.

He might have been second choice but Jacques Santer is proving a model
EC President, writes Murray Ritchie
JACQUES SANTER'S first 100 days as President of the European
Commission passed earlier this month and no-one appeared to notice much.
Perhaps that says more about his style than 1000 words but it is helpful
to remember that only Britain is worried at his record so far.
Elsewhere in Europe Santer is an unremarkable figure, whereas in the
UK he is approaching demonology status among British nationalists. This
represents a ridiculous paradox. After all it was John Major who put
Santer, supposedly a cipher, where he is today. After Douglas Hurd
decreed there must be no more ''philosopher kings'' at the top in
Brussels following the retirement of Jacques Delors, Major vetoed
Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian Prime Minister, for the succession.
Santer was everyone else's second but enforced choice. Yet it is only
Britain -- or at least our Conservative Government -- which frets over
Santer's vision of the post-Maastricht 2 integrationist Europe. Some
puppet.
The United Kingdom's isolation in the European Union is reflected
vividly in the fact that Santer has spent more time trying to calm
British fears about the next phase of EU integration than on any other
task. Yet his reasoned, consensual approach and patent moderation (by
common EU standards) in all things European are flung in his face by
people like Lord Tebbit, who denounced him last week has an unelected
Brussels bureaucrat seeking to boss Britain about.
It really is a bit rich for someone like Tebbit -- himself an
unelected and pensioned-off politician who lifts a living in the
undemocratic Lords at the taxpayer's expense -- to denounce Santer.
Jacques Santer may be the product of a small European nation (pause for
bout of British Big Country arrogance) but he has been tuned into the
leadership of Europe for much of his political life in a more
constructive and informed way than the average Tory chauvinist could
ever understand.
His humour has not deserted him as he wrestles with the bigger league.
Asked about his nickname of Jacques Sancerre recently -- he is said to
enjoy night-clubbing in Luxembourg -- he replied that he was offended.
''I enjoy Moselle -- from my own area,'' he replied with the smile which
is his trademark.
There is nothing dogmatic about Santer's form of conservatism and
Europeanism -- and we should remember that most of the British Tories'
supposedly natural allies in the EU are on the right. He comes from the
European Christian Democrat tradition in which the old, pre-Thatcher
Tory one-nation philosophy is still held in some respect.
When Lord Archer blustered unconvincingly on BBC radio yesterday that
Tony Blair would sell Britain down the European river if he had the
chance at the coming Maastricht review conference, he was talking tosh.
Tony Blair would do more than implement Tory policy -- or at least the
policy which John Major and Jacques Santer and other Euro-conservatives
agreed when Maastricht was concluded.
There is only one obvious exception, and that is the social chapter
which the Tories -- to the mystification of their Euro-allies -- are
determined to resist when the treaty is renegotiated. Even this is
overrated. Anyone who sits down and actually reads the social chapter of
Maastricht soon learns how vague and meaningless most of it really is.
That is why Major cleverly opted out. He knew his refusal was
essentially theatrical, but as an earnest of bogus British nationalism
it would earn him plaudits from his back benchers in the Commons, and he
was right. Forget disputes about the single currency for which Major
took a rain check; economic and monetary union is not part of the
Maastricht renegotiation. That argument is for another day.
Major's acrobatics in leaning every which way to reconcile the
irreconcilable in his riven party must soon be seen to fail. Either that
or Santer's vision of a more integrated and therefore more workable
European Union will come about without British membership.
But we know that the very idea of the United Kingdom quitting the EU
because of the infighting of one political party on the skids must
surely be a non-starter. Driven as it would be by English nationalism,
it would spell national economic ruin for a generation at least,
hastening the break-up of the nation state which is the United Kingdom.
Don't ask politicians. We are still talking here of the European Union
as a capitalist club predicated on the internal market and market
forces, with a touch of politics thrown in belatedly. Ask the British
business community which is the real force to be reckoned with.
Jacques Santer, suitor of British business, knows that the Maastricht
2 talks will probably last until around the time of the British General
Election. The potential for a vast domestic political explosion in the
UK on this issue is obvious.
After next month's Cannes summit the EU presidency passes from Jacques
Chirac's European-minded France to the Spanish socialists (big net
receivers) and then to the founding member, integrationist Italians, and
then to the most pro-European nation of the lot, the Irish. There is no
hiding place there for the British as they prepare to cut up rough in
the inter-government conference on Maastricht 2.
Santer, in his calm, diplomatic way, has tried to explain that to
Major. In private Major must understand and agree, but the time is not
yet ripe for public retreat from his opportunistic back bencher-friendly
Eurosceptic stance.
Santer wants Major to live up to his word and place Britain at the
heart of Europe. Most of Major's Cabinet want the same thing. They
reflect on the fact that the Santer vision of a closer Europe with more
majority voting is shared by the other 14 EU members.
Santer knows Britain is committed to cutting up rough, promising to
veto moves to reduce the veto, dedicated to changing the voting system,
rather iffy about deeper co-operation in defence and foreign affairs.
The former Luxembourg Premier has never enjoyed the power to shape
Europe. Despite what Tebbit and his cronies say now, he never will. The
commission and the European Parliament will have zero input -- we are
talking realism here -- in next year's negotiation. But Santer does
reflect mainstream thinking in the EU these days.
He might not enjoy Delors's intellectual force which so upset the
British Conservatives but only a fool would fail to recognise he has
been at the centre of the EU for a long time in his many and various
capacities including Finance Minister, Social Affairs Minister and Prime
Minister of his little country. Whose views, as opposed to votes, count
for more -- Santer's or Major's?
Santer speaks French, German, and Luxembourgish all well enough to
feel for the culture and soul of the tongues. He speaks English fluently
but probably not competently enough to grasp the undercurrent influences
of little (as opposed to middle) England which are the mainspring of the
new anti-Europeanism in the UK. Who does?
More important, he knows the real forces -- Benelux, France, and
Germany -- which will shape Europe along with support from Italy and
Spain and the more romantic Scandinavians. He shares their vision.
Santer is no European parvenu: he has been a governor of the IMF and
the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
For a generation he has been at the heart of councils of ministers and
European summits, a confidante of most leading European politicians for
years now.
He might have been a second choice, a moderate, and belatedly
unelected. But he is in touch with the rhythm of Europe which is more
than can be said for the British Government as it strives to resist the
force it let loose at that fateful meeting in Corfu last year when Major
catapulted the bewildered Prime Minister of tiny Luxembourg into a job
he did not seek or want but in which he is performing rather too well
for the Tories' liking.

Bullets Over Broadway, Various (Sony)
* RELIVE Woody Allen's current comedy, which stars Dianne Weist, with
this superb soundtrack collection which comprises original recordings
from the 1920s and re-creations -- by walking jazz thesaurus, Dick Hyman
-- of speakeasy jazz. In the former category are two Bix Beiderbecke
numbers; a nice guitar-led version (by the New Leviathan Original Fox
Trot Orchestra) of Lazy River and Irving Aaronson's Let's Misbehave. An
evocative collection, though at #12.99 for 44 minutes an expensive one.
Essential Pavarotti 1 and 2 (Decca)
* IT ain't over till the fat man sings . . . again and again and
again. Anything you've ever missed by Pavarotti is likely to be on this
double CD compilation. In 36 tracks he comprehensively covers the
operatic turf; every aria associated with the Big Man is represented
here, and a selection of Neopolitan love songs. If you haven't bought
the CDs individually, or amassed a Pav collection en route through his
career, this is the definitive set.
Pavarotti and Friends 2 (Decca)
* UTTERLY bizarre line-up as il Grande Tenore assembles a set of
fellow singers for a bit of fun. Not Domingo and Carerras, but -- would
you believe -- Bryan Adams and others. Now, much as I love ole gravel
voice Adams, the cringe factor soars when he teams up with big Luciano.
Grotesque does not come into it. For one thing, Pavarotti should lay off
the crossover stuff -- his Moon River is appalling -- and when Bryan
Adams does the same (joining Pav in O Sole Mio) it is screamingly awful.
The one combination track that does work is All For Love, with Pav doing
his stratospheric, spine-tingling thing in the chorus.
I Won't Be Afraid Anymore, Nomos (Grapevine)
* THE umpteenth new Irish group of the 1990s, these five Cork
University students play traditional and traditional-styled tunes with
all the skill, discipline and imagination we have become almost blase
about hearing. The close partnership and carefree facility of Niall
Vallely (concertina) and Liz Doherty (fiddle) are particularly exciting.
But this is a group effort and, the odd indifferent song aside, an
auspicious debut.
Live 93-94, The Bill Wells Octet (Loathsome Reels)
* FALKIRK-based composer/bass guitarist Wells specialises in dark,
tightly drawn textures, stark themes, and jabbing riffs that, for all
their superficial menace, contain a certain comic-strip humour. His
band, featuring some of Scotland's leading young (and not so young) jazz
musicians, essays a suitable blend of reverence and obstreperousness but
I can't help feeling there's something bigger in there trying to get
out.
Don't Wear Suits, Assassin (Juce)
* A most mellifluous assemblage of pop reggae tunes which may do as
much to popularise the emergent highlife-dub genre as the Stereo MCs'
Connected album did for trip-house. It's got chanking guitars, spacey
drums, and echoing piano bits, plus a well-developed social conscience.
Anthems 2, various (Street Sounds)
* The only bad thing about this collection of 10 jazz-funk epics from
the mid-to-late seventies is the photograph on the album sleeve. The
picture features a packed dance-floor scene in which many young people
are sweating profusely and determinedly shaking their booties to an epic
beat. What upsets me is a gormless young man in the foreground. He has a
smudgy moustache and bad skin. He is staring shortsightedly, as though
he has lost his spectacles . . . he looks like me. I think he is me. Buy
this album; burn the sleeve.
Touching From A Distance, Deborah Curtis (Faber and Faber, pp 212,
#9.99)
* Fifteen years on, Ian Curtis's widow flatly demythologises his
suicide. It was committed on the eve of his departure to America for a
tour with Joy Division, the band whose plangent post-punk noise matched
Ian's alienated air and gloom-touched-by-glam lyrics. Deborah's husband,
a boy who would never grow up, had marginalised her more and more as Joy
Division's success increased. Taking himself a mistress, he confined his
wife to home, banning her from Joy Division shows. His self-inflicted
death at the age of 23 cast him centre-stage in a drama of his own
devising: the tortured artist whose suffering for his muse is greater
than anyone else's. The prat. A brave little book about a daft wee
laddie.
Black Talk!/Black Drops, Charles Earland (BGP)
* Organist Earland is shown getting on the good foot with this reissue
of two vintage vinyl albums, originally released on the Prestige label,
on one CD. Black Talk! dates from 1969, Black Drops from the following
year. Heavier than better-known names like Jack McDuff and Jimmy Smith,
as well as poppier and snappier. Paint your life an Earland shade of
black.

Hang onto your hats and get a firm grip on your courage as Adrian
Gardiner adds a little danger to his life and takes a white-knuckle ride
through the theme parks which attract millions of UK daredevils and
thrill-seekers each year
A STEEL harness clamps over our shoulders. The floor drops away
leaving our legs dangling in space. The carriage -- a dozen rows of
seats suspended from a monorail -- ascends a 45-degree incline to 80
feet above the ground. As with most ''white-knuckle'' rides, there's a
moment for reflection. Are our shoelaces tied tightly? Did the service
engineers remember to tighten that last nut and bolt?
Then we're off -- hurtling past skulls and simulated rivers of blood;
sideways, upside-down, heading straight towards a cliff face and veering
aside at the last possible moment. On the bends we feel the G-forces
suck out our cheeks. It lasts only 60 seconds or, to put it another way,
a lifetime.
This is Nemesis. It opened at Easter, 1994, at Alton Towers in
Staffordshire. It is the archetypal white-knuckle ride: short, fast, and
terrifying. In the opinion of my research team -- Alice, aged 9, and
Adam, aged 13, -- it is the best in Britain. ''You think you're going to
die,'' is Adam's description. It should be good -- it cost almost #12
million to design and build.
We have come a long way since the candyfloss fairgrounds of my own
childhood. Such fairs still exist. Driving through windswept Fife one
chilly November night last year, I saw one and stopped for a look. It
was all there: the dodgems, the waltzers, the posse of teenage boys
eyeing up the group of teenage girls who were pretending not to notice.
The electric smell of ozone mingling with the aroma of half-cooked
hamburgers. A time-warp. A journey to the centre of nostalgia.
Today's hi-tech, virtual-reality theme parks are a growth industry; a
dynamic sector, as marketing jargon has it.
Five years ago Alton Towers was barely half its present size. Visitor
numbers to the park topped three million last year. In between rides,
those three million consumed more than a million ice-creams, half a
million frankfurters, sticks of rock equivalent to 733 times the height
of the Eiffel Tower, and drank four swimming-pools worth of coffee.
The world's first theme park -- Disneyland in California -- opened 40
years ago. Disneyland came to Europe in 1992 with 29 attractions; when
Space Mountain opens in June this year it will be the 40th. We include
it in our survey because, with direct Air France flights from Glasgow
and Edinburgh, it is possible to reach the park, built in a loop of the
River Marne east of Paris, in less time than it takes to drive down the
M6 to Alton Towers.
No British park comes close to Disneyland in scale. Visitor numbers
have passed the 13-million mark and at peak times 18,000 staff are
employed. The vast complex comprises six hotels, an artificial lake, a
railway station, the theme park and Festival Disney: a downtown-USA mall
of shops, restaurants, and entertainment. In a blitz of red and blue
neon, Festival Disney stays open after the park has closed for the
night.
Frontierland, Fantasyland, Adventureland, Discoveryland, and Main
Street, all centred round Sleeping Beauty's castle, make up the theme
park. Main Street is an authentic reproduction of 1890s America. Among
the classic rides is Big Thunder Mountain, a runaway mine train. Pirates
of the Caribbean is an underground boat ride with holograms, robots, and
hundreds of special effects. Star Tours is a virtual reality simulator:
you travel through space aided by futuristic computer graphics. And
Indiana Jones et le Temple du Peril is probably Europe's most thrilling
rollercoaster.
At Disneyland Paris, the Father of the theme park meets the Father of
science fiction. Half a dozen rides are inspired by Jules Verne novels.
The Disney designers (they use the word ''imagineers'') have based Space
Mountain on Verne's From the Earth to the Moon and when it opens in June
it will be the biggest attraction in the park.
''We've had some challenging technical problems to solve,'' a Disney
press officer told me as we stroll down Main Street. ''No-one ever built
a ride like this before.'' Details are being withheld until later this
year, but we hear that the new Space Mountain combines a rollercoaster
with a catapult and travels at more than 50 mph. We can hardly wait.
My junior researcher's favourite attraction at Disneyland is not a
ride, however. It is breakfast. ''Character Breakfasts'' are held every
morning at the opulent Disneyland Hotel. Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Chip and
Dale and the others come round the room shaking paws, signing autographs
and posing for pictures.
Chip and Dale take great delight in spoonfeeding the children, and few
adults escape the indignity either. All in all, the combination of an
American experience with French style works well at Disneyland Paris,
and the attention to detail is superb.
The major theme parks in Britain are Alton Towers; Thorpe Park,
south-west of London; the American Adventure Park (AAP) in Derbyshire;
and Camelot which, in Lancashire, is the clostest to Scotland.
After Nemesis, my young researchers voted the Runaway Mine Train at
Alton Towers as the best ride in Britain. You rattle off into
authentically-dilapidated mine workings, pick up speed and plunge
downhill. One vicious bend leaves your stomach behind and you wonder how
the train stayed on the track. Just when you think it's over . . . no,
we won't spoil it for you.
The mine train theme is popular with park designers: the Yosemite Mine
Train is a highlight of the American Adventure Park. The Black Hole at
Alton Towers is a rollercoaster in the dark -- very fast, very scary.
The Beast at Camelot, also in the dark, has novel lighting effects.
Children enjoy getting wet. You find water rides at most theme parks.
The AAP has Nightmare Niagara, said to be the highest triple-drop log
flume in the world. Alton Tower's Log Flume is good fun, but the team's
favourite (''again, again!'') is the Congo River Rapids, also at Alton
Towers. Circular six-seater rubber rafts carry you down an approximation
of the Colorado River; there are a couple of mean waterspouts. No need
to wear a hood: you'll enjoy that gallon of cold water down your neck.
The humble ghost train has evolved into a state-of-the-art
masterpiece. Camelot's Dungeon of Doom might frighten very young
children. Not my pair, who dismiss it contemptuously: ''Not scary at
all''. Alton Tower's Haunted House, by contrast, is wonderfully gloomy
and Gothic. It somehow achieves an extra dimension of creepiness which
even Phantom Manor at Disneyland doesn't quite aspire to, excellent
though it is.
Holograms, skeletons, and sudden surprises kept us on the edge of our
seats. ''Makes your hair stand on end,'' said Adam -- adding, as he
moves out of swiping range, ''if you have any''. The Rack at Camelot, an
80-seater gondola, articulated in the middle, is pivoted telescopically
at each end to giant revolving cranks. The carriage is thus free to
swing and move simultaneously in several directions. The sensation is
odd: not unlike being in a small boat in a large sea, although safer. A
similarly clever piece of engineering called the Energizer will open
this year at Alton Towers.
Why do we do it? Why do we enjoy defying the laws of gravity or
plunging down a 60-foot water drop at 40 mph? One theory is there's not
enough danger in our lives -- though Nemesis compares favourably to some
airlines I've travelled with. Another reason, particularly among
teenagers, is bravado -- the ''I survived Nemesis'' syndrome.
Years ago a Californian therapist devised ''primal scream therapy''.
Screaming as long and as loudly as you can releases tension and reduces
stress. Screaming in public is not socially acceptable -- except in
newspaper offices or whenever Jeremy Beadle appears on television. But
if you are not screaming by the time you get halfway round Nemesis then
you are in the minority.
It is, of course, the illusion of danger which is being marketed. All
British parks have an excellent safety record. The only trouble in
recent years concerned a new rollercoaster at Blackpool which hit the
ground and the headlines more than once in 1994. For safety,
white-knuckle rides have harnesses or steel locking bars. Height
restrictions, usually about four feet, effectively rule out children
under about eight or 10.
There's much more to theme parks than Nightmare Niagara or the Runaway
Mine Train. Designers have created entertainment for the young and old,
the brave and the cautious. More gentle pursuits include cable cars,
miniature railways, and 3-D cinemas. Pantomime is popular too. Staged
shows such as the Jousting Knights at Camelot and the Silver City
Shoot-out (AAP) deserve their rapt audiences -- more for slapstick, good
old British farce, and genuine equestrian skills, than for historical
accuracy.
Theme parks cater for young children and toddlers with swings and
roundabouts both traditional and sophisticated. Alton Towers has
Gallopers Carousel; Disneyland Le Carrousel de Lancelot. The AAP offers
the Mason-Dixon Flyer and Camelot the Balloon Ride and Kingdom In the
Clouds, a ferris wheel of striped medieval gondolas. Toyland Tours at
Alton Towers is a leisurely boat ride through a toy factory. Like
Disneyland's It's a Small World, it is aimed at the very young, though
the sheer exuberance of primary colours and costumes impresses older
children and adults too.
Where will theme parks be in another 40 years? Computer-generated
virtual reality will play an increasingly-prominent role. The simulators
-- Star Tours at Disney and Motion Master at the AAP -- are among the
shape of things to come as we hurtle down the log flume of life towards
the 21st century and cyberfrenetic interactive hyperbolical space.
(Who's screaming now?) Or perhaps the plot of the movies Westworld
(theme park) and Jurassic Park, where the robots and dinosaurs get out
of control and go hunting down the visitors, isn't so improbable after
all.
FACTFILE
* Alton Towers, Staffordshire, ST10 4DB (signposted from M6 and M1),
telephone 01538-703 334. Direct trains Glasgow to Stoke-on-Trent. Hotel
due to open 1996. Open 9am to dusk, to November 5 (spectacular fireworks
display final two weekends).
Prices: adult #16.50; child #12.50; under-fours free. Next-day return
ticket #6.
When to go: end of June, avoid August and any bank holiday weekend.
Good points: high proportion of best rides in Britain.
Bad points: a victim of its size. Be prepared for a lot of walking.
Long queues in summer. Car-park located far away: monorail transport,
but a nuisance if you've left anything in your car. Have observed
increase in ''yob culture'', such as gangs of teenage youths queue
jumping, shouting and swearing. Sells large amount of junk food and
merchandising.
* American Adventure Park Ilkeston, Derbyshire, telephone 01773-531
521. Close to junction 26 of M1. Open 10am to dusk, April 8 to September
10, then weekends only until last week of October.
Prices: adult/child #1.99; under-fours free. Wristband for rides:
#6.99 and #5.50.
When to go: anytime.
Good points: relaxed, family atmosphere. Short queues. Lakeside ''Blue
Fin'' restaurant sets high standards. Plenty for under eights, and
pricing structure is more flexible than in other parks.
Bad Points: avoid the Missile if you have the slightest back problem.
* Camelot Charnock Richard, Preston, Lancashire; telephone 01257-453
044. Close to junction 28 of M6; direct trains Glasgow-Preston. Open
10am to dusk, every day in June, July, August, middle two weeks April
and last week October. Weekends only in May, September and October.
Prices #11.99 adult or child. Under-fours free.
Good points: short queues and family atmosphere. Unique spectacle of
the Jousting Knights.
Bad points: expensive for a large family.
* Disneyland Paris. Contact through UK booking centre: 01733-335 505
and ask for Disneyland Paris brochures. Open all year. Low season is
January 2 to March 30. Park opens about 9.30am and closes 6pm in winter,
later in summer.
Prices: many different packages available. See a travel agent or
contact Air France Holidays, Gable House, 18-24 Turnham Green Road,
London W4 1RF, telephone 0181-742 0303. As a guide, this summer one-day
admission will be #24 adult, #20 child, under-threes free. Reductions
are promised for October and through next winter.
Funds permitting, it makes sense to stay in one of the six hotels
which are within walking distance (or by shuttle bus) of the park.
Hotel prices vary widely, from #40 per night in an economy hotel in
low season, to #270 per night at the luxury Disneyland Hotel in high
season. This is per room (sleeping four), not per person.
When to go: avoid high summer, Christmas and New Year, Easter and last
two weeks of February.
Good points: it's all wonderful. .
Bad points: expensive. When Eurodisney first opened, it attracted
criticism for high restaurant prices -- in the USA, at least fast food
is cheap food. The management has revised its structure but still, for
example, #1.50 for a Coke and #3 for a half-pint of beer is the norm.
Moreover, you're not officially allowed to bring your own sustenance
into the park.
And note that a shuttle bus from the airport to the park and back for
a family of four will add #80 to the cost of your holiday.
FIVE ESSENTIAL TOURING TIPS
1. Arrange a meeting point before anyone gets lost.
2. Decide what you most want to do and go there first. Arrive at the
entrance before opening time: queues increase steadily through the day.
If it rains, go anyway. Queues will be shorter.
3. Take fruit, crisps, sweets, cold drinks. They help pass the time
while queuing.
4. Have at least one zipped pocket for loose change, car keys etc.
Pickpockets are rarely a problem, but you'll feel more secure while
upside-down.
5. Treat the day as a marathon, not a sprint. Let the youngest member
of the party set the pace, so no-one gets burned out.

Elizabeth Westcott looks at a new book which promises magical
transformaton of walls, floors and furniture
IF you are planning any home decorating at all, from a simple coat of
paint to more complicated work, The Decorator's Handbook by Jocasta
Innes is a source of inspiration.
On the glossy pages of this attractively presented book, Innes
demonstrates how having a paintbrush, a new idea and a trick or two up
your sleeve, can transform the most ordinary looking furniture, and the
most depressing looking rooms.
Rather than presenting a finished series of postcard perfect
interiors, Innes takes four rooms in varying states of disrepair from a
real home, and uses before and after shots to show how these
transformations are possible. Encouragingly, the sitting room, kitchen,
bathroom and bedroom selected are typical examples of what many people
have in their homes.
The results are dramatic. Different themes are chosen for each room,
providing for interesting stylistic variations. The sitting room is
richly painted in a yellow colourwash, with gentle red and green
details, while the bedroom becomes soft and romantic with cool
Scandinavian shades. The kitchen is decorated in blocks of primary
colour. For those of you who have inherited chrom-edged laminate from
the seventies, you will be excited to know that paint can work its magic
over this surface too, once it has been sanded and primed.
The most impressive metamorphoses of all is the bathroom. Its ghastly
interior of exposed pipes and crumbling lino is painted over in warm
terracotta, and a few glittering special effects -- like frosted stars
on the window and a gold striped mirror -- turn it from a hovel into
what is possibly the grooviest bathroom in Britain.
Jocasta Innes has the pragmatic approach to home decorating which
characterises the best DIY handbooks. She gives excellent advice on
developing an individual decorating style, using colour, how to assess
the light and features of rooms to their best advantage, and how to cost
projects. Also useful are the hints on confronting problems found in
more dilapidated properties.
However, don't be mislead into thinking that with this book you can
transform an ordinary abode into a charming home; decorating is a messy
and time-consuming affair, as Innes herself points out. First-time
decorators might be better off experimenting with smaller projects
before tackling a room, let alone an entire house. Using crackle glaze,
which splits the paint into alligator skin crazing, paint distressing
techniques, stencilled designs, or the trickier art of decoupage, you
can place your individual stamp on frames, chairs, tables and walls --
and in the process of experimentation you may discover something
entirely new!
* The Decorator's Handbook, Decorating the Paint Magic Way by Jocasta
Innes is published by Boxtree at #15.99.

SMALL is beautiful, quite deliberately so, in three new communications
gadgets launched by Ian Stevens. In fact the Gloucester company has
merged electronics with aesthetics to produce a revolutionary new
concept . . . . jewelotronics.
They've brought out designer devices offering style and function
combined. Pictured above (at the bottom), this ergonomically designed
little pendant, to be worn around the neck as a fashion accesspory, is
actually an FM radio, ultra lightweight, ultra-compact, and pretty
damned flash, if you ask me.
Above it, less than 10 centimetres long is a solar-powered radio which
eliminates the need for batteries altogether. It comes complete with
stereo earpieces and a belt clip. The solar cell flips up to reveal the
AM/FM band selector and tuning dial.
On the left, what looks like a key-ring fob is actually a pocket-sized
memo recorder, the latter-day digital equivalent of the knotted
handkerchief. This gizmo will digitally record a message up to 20
seconds long. All three items are available from Ian Stevens in
Cheltenham, 01242-577 257.

Introducing a regular new column by Joe Donnelly which will feature
all aspects of technology and the way it effects our daily lives. First,
a report on how scientists are putting drinks under the microscope
THIRTY-FIVE millilitres of grain carbohydrates converted to ethanol,
flavour compounds, volatile components in a malt distillate, on the bar,
soon as you like, please.
In other words, make mine a half, Scotch whisky, naturally. As you'll
have guessed, the aforementioned gobbledegook is what gives whisky its
bite, though repeating the recipe after an old fashioned gill is nigh-on
impossible. To most of us, whisky is a magical mystery, the water of
life, a drink surrounded by legend and folklore and followed by sore
heads.
Yet scientists John Piggot and Alistair Paterson, at the University of
Strathclyde, are working to unravel the secrets of smooth scotch.
The two doctors have immersed themselves in their subject, purely
academically of course, so one is led to understand. They've been
studying the liquid which has been distilled in Scotland for centuries
and now generates more than two billion pounds in exports.
Old distillers might think they know everything about our other
national drink; barley and wheat carbohydrates fermented to alcohol by
yeasts then concentrated by distillation and then matured in oaken casks
for a minimum of three years. Nothing to it? Not so simple.
John and Alistair, researchers at the Department of Bioscience and
Biotechnology's centre for food quality, have been doing some serious
investigative research into the aspects of ''smoothness''' and
''maturity'', qualities some of my colleagues are still aiming for. The
smoothness and maturity are standards used by connoisseurs, and the man
in the street, to judge whisky quality. As the market for premium
quality whiskies grows, the researchers aimed their study at
understanding the fundamental origins governing those sensory
characteristics.
In short, they wanted to find out what gives top whisky its edge.
Working with The Chivas and Glenlivet Group, the two doctors have been
able to model the relationship between the structure and composition of
whisky and the sensory data, comparing the substance to the taste.
''Conventionally, taste panelists are trained to quantify a flavour by
using chemical standards with particular aroma characters,'' Alistair
said. ''But this is different with complex attributes like smoothness.''
It seems that as we drink whisky, volatile compounds pass from the
mouth to nerve endings in the nose. The stimuli are then quantified in
the brain. Studies show that concentrations of different aroma compounds
in the air of the glass immediately above the whisky are affected by the
accumulation of non-volatile substances extracted from the wood of the
barrel.
More gobbledegook? No. Further research has discovered that wood
compounds themselves produce changes in the liquid structures and these
mirror changes in sensory quality.
''Our earlier studies show a relationship between smoothness and
concentration of compounds from the wood,'' Alistair said.
The doctors are confident they are getting close to the secrets of
smooth Scotch and they believe their research could have important
implications for other alcoholic drinks.
Well and good and very commendable. Hopefully they will also be able
to isolate the volatile hangover chemical while they're at it, as a
service to mankind.
Still on the scientific subject of exciseable liquor, the Institute of
Food Research has combined its expertise in physical and immunological
science with the specialist knowledge of major brewers to try to find
the perfect head for a pint of beer.
The IFR believes that a good head on a beer is an essential aspect of
customer perceived quality. To achieve this, brewers need to ensure that
the necessary natural components are present in the raw materials going
into production and that they are released efficiently during the
process to produce a desireable foam.
In one project, antibodies to beer foam proteins are used to boost
levels of the vital ingredients during malting and brewing. In another
study, the enhancement of foam stability is being avidly pursued. This,
the IFR, hopes, will increase the value of food crops and enable UK
beers to compete more effectively in the international market.
For the punter, it should help produce the perfect, long-lasting head.
Cheers boys.
A third study project -- these academics seem to like their drink --
has put the new Euro-measures under the microscope. Students on the
Hospitality Management Studies degree course at Caledonian University
held a recent conference, along with Strathclyde's Trading Standards
Department, on the effects of the new drinks measures.
The switch from the Gill and franctions thereof to metric measures
shows that some pubs are making more per ''half'' and that drinkers
following the guidelines relating to the number of units of alcohol
could be over the safety levels on their weekly intake.

* HOW many pounds of ripe, succulent fruit do you expect from your
tomato plants? Five pounds, 10 pounds, 15 -- or even more? Plants set
out two or three weeks ago should now be in vigorous growth, writes IAN
WALLS. How much, depends on the temperatures they have been in.
If you are like me and a bit mean with heating, your plants should be
12 to 18in tall. If you planted early in April, without stinting the
heat, you could have 3 to 4ft plants, with fair-sized fruits.
Specialised growers get 30lb or more of fruit per plant. They plant
early and have layering systems. The average gardener, planting in April
or May, is likely to have plants 6 to 7ft tall. Above this, they
invariably have their tops nipped out.
The secret of success is being very careful with watering and feeding
throughout the whole season. Start with balanced nutrient feeds.
Continue with high potash feeds.
Look at the three figures on your fertiliser: nitrogen, phosphorus and
potash. Chempak does a range of plant foods. I would suggest the ideal
combination is its balanced plant food, with a 20 : 20 : 20 analysis, to
start with. Go on to high potash, which is 15 : 15 : 30, once fruits get
well formed.
Getting flowers to set properly, for even trusses, depends on plants
never being short of water or feeding.
Furthermore, keep the atmosphere moist so that pollen does not dry up.
Otherwise, you will get a lot of chat fruit, never a decent size.
To ensure good setting, shut vents in the morning when the sun is up.
Spray the plants overhead, to moisten the atmosphere. Regularly nip out
side shoots, and keep plants properly supported.
Another factor is avoiding rapid fluctuation in water supplies. This
can result in black bottoms, detracting from plant appeal.
Intermittent water supply can happen in growing bags, unless you have
a system that keeps them constantly moist. This is why gardeners like to
use big boxes of soil and manure, or the greenhouse border. There are
greater reserves of moisture there.
You must also avoid disease. Watering plants at night, with moisture
trapped on the fruit, can cause rot.
In my plastic greenhouse I have an overhead spray line. I use it only
early in the season until plants are 3-4ft tall. Then I revert to
watering on the ground. If I water overhead in the morning, the foliage
dries out quickly, before any risk of disease.
The moist atmosphere in the west of Scotland is very conducive to
fungal diseases such as botrytis, however. It is difficult to avoid
unless you spray regularly with fungicide.
Another tip is to make sure liquid feed dilution is correct. It is
better to feed every time you water rather than intermittently. Along
with erratic watering, this can mean fruit splits.
Spotting can occur after July and August, from moisture drying on the
surface overnight. Fungal spores are enough to make minor inroads into
the skin of the fruit.
Removing leaves, to allow air movement, is a must. This means regular
snapping -- not cutting -- of lower leaves, up to or just beyond the
ripening truss. Cutting leaves can result in disease. Snap off cleanly,
first thing in the morning.
There is really quite a science in making a good job of tomatoes.
Frost-hit fruit
* THE late spring frosts have caused considerable damage across the
country. In Scotland, there is concern in the soft fruit growing
industry that damage may be severe, especially to raspberries.
Raspberries in gardens may be affected and you should look closely at
clusters of flower buds. See if they look black and scorched. If so, it
is unlikely that flowers will open properly.
. If the frosts continue, it would be worth it to get up early and
give raspberries a spray of water. This removes the frost.

* THERE tends to be a misconception about the role of chrysanths in
the garden, writes IAN WALLS. Many people consider them only as
show-bench material, instead of the beautiful decorative plants they
are.
My wife, for one, would be devastated if I did not grow sufficient
spray chrysanths to keep her supplied from late August to October. And
they are really very simple to grow.
I planted mine a few days ago, in a well prepared circular bed. It had
a good 4oz per square yard dressing of Vitax Q4 fertiliser. The plants
came from the specialist firm of Woolman of Dorridge,
They sent me a nice collection of garden sprays a few weeks ago, and I
potted them up and grew them on in my greenhouse, before planting them
out 12in or so apart, with the growing tops pinched out.
A bit of liquid feeding now and then will not go amiss, and that is
pretty well all there is to it.

* RECENT extremely cold weather has curbed enthusiasm for gardening
considerably. Add the loss of many half-hardy bedding plants, due to
overnight frost, and it provides quite a tale of woe.
Apart from weeds, many things seem reluctant to grow. It is all
related to temperature. Despite this, many shrubs have flowered
beautifully. The blossom on some, like rhododendrons, has been touched
by frost.
Several gardeners have asked me recently why pieris is not only
flowering well but has brightly coloured bracts. Whatever combination of
circumstances is responsible, it is very welcome.
There may be tasks you should have done, but have been neglected. The
other day I passed a garden where roses hadn't been pruned at all, yet
they were making away nicely.
Gardening Which? points out that, in a trial, roses pruned with hedge
shears, instead of with secateurs, have given a better performance than
those done meticulously.
So be it. Trials are trials, but as rosarian Alistair Urquhart, of
Greenhead Nursery in Inchinnan, has been at pains to point out on
several occasions, rose-pruning in a wet area must be done with a degree
of exactitude. Otherwise, there is dieback.
Pests are on the go again, and I notice greenfly on my tomatoes.
Aphids can cause trouble too, and spread virus disease. Fortunately,
several tomato varieties are more tolerant nowadays.
In the vegetable garden, remember to keep up efforts to deter cabbage
root fly. You can get cabbage collars if you don't like chemical
methods. A packet of 30 won't set you back much more than #1.50 and will
prevent the adult fly laying eggs at the stem.
Germination of some vegetable seeds is proving patchy. They didn't
like extremely hot weather. There may even have been germination and
seedlings were scorched by the sun.
I am also encountering poor germination in the annual border, sown out
twice in one particular area. There is still not a lot of germination.
It's thinning out time for many vegetables -- lettuce, turnips,
radishes and in early districts carrot and beetroot. It sounds wasteful,
but it's necessary.
Through in the Dundee area the other day, I saw fields of lettuce
under floating polythene film, being harvested. It shows what can be
done with a bit of warmth.

THE new president of the National Association of Estate Agents is part
of a very special team. As she formally takes office at the
association's AGM at Glasgow's Hilton Hotel this weekend, May Storrie
will be rounding off a unique double. Her presidency marks the first
time a husband and wife have both headed the NAEA. George Storrie, her
husband and business partner, was president in 1986.
Such teamwork is nothing new to the Storries, two of the most
successful property practitioners in the UK. Their involvement in estate
agency goes back to the sixties when May started her property career
with Clyde Valley Estate Agency. After training with the firm in Glasgow
for six months, she was asked to run their operation in Hamilton. As
business grew she offered to buy the franchise from Clyde Valley and
Donald joined her in the business at that stage.
''After that, the rest is history,'' she says. The firm went from
strength to strength and was sold to Nationwide during the eighties'
property boom when major institutions were buying up estate agency
chains. By that time the firm had grown to some 35 branches, a
remarkable success for the Hamilton-based couple who went into
Nationwide in senior management positions.
In 1988 the Storries bought back the right to use their own brand name
from Nationwide and set up in business again -- just before the property
bubble burst.
''We saw the recession coming and started to retrench our operation so
that we could run the whole thing from our office in Hamilton,'' says
May Storrie. ''If you looked at all of the signs it seemed like the boom
was set to continue. People were paying crazy prices for property, but
when we charted our progress we could see that things were going awry.''
While some other agencies continued to open new offices to expand
their market share, the Storries were busy scaling down their operation
in preparation for the downturn they saw coming.
''We'd been through the recession of the seventies, so we were
determined not to get caught out. It takes courage to close an estate
agency office -- there's a kind of false pride which makes you want to
show your competitors that you are going from strength to strength --
but this is a family business and you've got to look after it very
carefully,'' she says.
Both May and George admit that they have been surprised by the length
and depth of the current recession. Unlike previous slumps this one has
affected the middle classes, throwing many people out of work who were
not at risk on previous occasions: ''It's the middle managers who seem
to be getting hit,'' George says. ''They come in to ask us to sell their
#150,000 home -- precisely the sort of house that is hardest hit at the
moment. It really is very sad.''
The growth of short-term contracts is an area the Storries believe
needs an urgent response from the lending institutions. Banks and
building societies are wary about lending to people who are not in
traditional full-time employment, yet the tide of change is bringing new
waves of short-term contracts, freelancing, self-employment, part-time
working, and other ways of earning a living which the lenders
traditionally view as too risky for a standard mortgage.
May Storrie feels the banks and building societies will have to change
their attitude and introduce flexible loan arrangements if the new-style
workforce is to find the finance for housing.

YOU know the thing. A glossy magazine sends an unctuous writer and an
anxious photographer round to the residence that's been selected as
''house of the month''.
The place has been Hoovered, the lady is just back from the
hairdresser, and dressed as if for a tea-dance, the baby doesn't have
teething rash, and the man is nowhere to be seen. Even all the CDs are
in their boxes.
With cries of extravagant praise, the editorial duo throw themselves
into their work. Every swatch of fresh, summery wallpaper, every cotton
throw and every satin swag is twittered over and recorded for posterity.
Every brass gong brought back from Tibet and every South American fetish
doll is interviewed in depth.
I think the writer and the lady of the house must shout all the time.
Certainly when the piece is written it's thick with exclamation marks.
''What a lovely damask tablecloth!'' ''Yes, isn't it! Mark asked me what
I wanted for Christmas and I said a second Hoover! But he got me that
instead!'' And so on.
Later in the pub, the editorial duo are mulling over their hard day.
''I'm fed up churning out the same piece every month,'' moans the
writer, ''and just changing the names and the colours. And I've got a
sore throat from all the exclamation marks.''
''What about me?'' sighs the photographer. ''Why do these people grin
at me all the time? I'm getting a complex.''
So they cook up a scheme. Next time they will not warn the ''house of
the month'' that they're coming. The lady won't have been to the
hairdresser, the man will be on the couch with his socks off, watching a
video, and the baby will be eating from the saucepan with its fingers.
A marvellous idea: no more condescension, no more taste-superiority,
no more exclamation marks. I've been reading the glossy magazines
avidly, but so far the piece hasn't appeared.

Stewart Fraser puts the spotlight on some interesting developments
* TAKE an ordinary garden shed. Paint it in bright colours. Suddenly,
it's a playhouse for the kids and a place for them to store their own
garden tools. It's a wheeze from Gardenstore at Texas, to interest
youngsters in the great outdoors.
They could collect carrot tops. Plant them in moist soil. In a few
days, the tops sprout feathery leaves. Other fast movers to grow outside
include radishes, mustard and cress.
* ORDERS have been coming in from the Far East as well as the UK for a
popular new range of architectural trelliswork by Avalon Garden
Interiors of Devon. This range was launched in May, as a development of
custom designs first exhibited at the Chelsea Show in 1981 and now
available as standard. A feature is made of moulded frames with mitred
corners. A trompe l'oeil panel is available for #485, but other items
can be bought for less.
* SINCE statistics suggest that one in ten of us is left-handed, it
makes sense for Sandvik to come up with left-handed secateurs. Their
P6-20, ergonomically designed for prolonged use without strain, have
handles made from a mixture of carbon and glassfibre, which is lighter
than aluminium. The blade is steel, coated against rust and with a sap
groove. There is a thumb-operated safety lock, and a heavy duty spring
prevents clogging and gives a smooth cut. Price: #33.50.

ONE of Britain's smallest natural born killers is set to make a
comeback, with a little help from the tree-huggers of the Forestry
Commission.
The Merlin falcon, a spectacularly agile predator, has suffered a
population slump in the past few decades, possibly due to DDT and other
pesticides passed up the food chain and absorbed from prey. Now a
forestry study shows that numbers could be increasing and good forestry
practices could help this handsome and fierce little raptor make a
comeback.
Merlins normally nest on the ground, in heathers and moorland, but
research shows that they can be persuaded to take advantage of trees if
they can find old crow and magpie nests where their chicks will be safe
from predators such as foxes and stoats.
The forestry study shows that heavy activity around nest sites can
make parents abandon their young and suggests that the commission
establish disturbance-free zones around nests from April to July. It
also advocates that large areas of moorland be left unplanted close to
forests where Merlin falcons are breeding to give them the best chances
of finding food, and the optimum survival potential.
With luck, breeding numbers should increase, offering ramblers more of
an opportunity to see this little killer in action as it snatches its
fast-moving prey directly from the air.

ONE of central Edinburgh's oldest remaining family businesses --
Herrald Antiques, founded in 1882 -- is moving to Perthshire because of
high business rates and car parking problems, writes WENDY JACK.
Its closure next Saturday will mean the loss of one of the city's most
attractive shops, at the corner of Queen Street and Frederick Street,
where distinctive statuary standing sentinel above the windows have made
compulsive viewing for 70 years.
Edinburgh's loss is Perthshire's gain. Herrald will relocate to the
handsome Georgian mansion, King's of Kinloch, formerly run as a hotel,
on the old Perth-Aberdeen road four-and-a-half miles beyond Coupar
Angus, and half-a-mile short of Meigle. Two eagles adorn the gateposts
at the foot of the drive.
''We will probably become Herrald of Edinburgh at King's of Kinloch,''
says proprietor Bruce Herrald, the fourth generation of the family to
run the business founded by his great-grandfather in Howe Street in
1882. He bought the Queen Street shop in 1925 and the flat above the
shop a year later.
''Everything is subject to planning, but we intend to lay out room
settings on the ground floor of King's of Kinloch, to show our stock to
full advantage,'' says Bruce. His wife Joyce Paterson, a teacher of
ballet, tap and jazz, will create two studios in the basement ballroom.
''We'll live on the two upper floors,'' says Bruce, ''and return the
accommodation to the original.''
Herrald, he says has always combined antique and reproduction
furniture. ''I think that's one of the main aspects. If we decked out
totally with antiques in this size of showroom, we'd have #2m-#4m worth,
which quite honestly would be better in the bank. We have a lot of
reproductions because of the price.''
Are some customers adamant that they want antiques rather than
reproductions?
''Yes. We explain that the big pedestal table they are seeking is
going to cost them double-figure thousands in itself, then you start to
add on a set of antique chairs -- which in some cases with their age
should be looked at and not sat on if they're genuine -- and again,
you're well into double figures.
''They start to realise this is going to cost half the price of the
house -- that's why we have reproductions. For #2000-#3000 we can sort
them out with a very nice copy of a Regency table, a set of chairs and a
commode sideboard or whatever. If it's properly made, it's tomorrow's
antique.''
The Queen Mother has regularly bought from the shop, and Princess
Margaret still visits it. ''The Queen is the only one who hasn't come,''
smiles Bruce. ''She passes at 60mph these days. The Queen Mother, when
she was Queen, would stop the car and come in.''

BAFFLED reader Sam Leitch, of Highfield Drive, Clarkston, throws us a
scientific puzzler.
''Can you tell me how a whale breathes in?'' asks Sam. ''There doesn't
seem to be enough time after the ''blow'' and the whale seems to dive
down immediately after the spout rises.''
The instinctive answer is that whales have probably sussed out the
fact that several countries are still harpooning cetaceans, which is as
good a reason as any for getting down below the surface pretty darned
sharply. To stay down, they naturally need air.
Dr Andrew Kitchener, Curator of Birds and Mammals at the Royal Museum
in Edinburgh, helps us with this explanation: ''Whales don't fill their
lungs to stay underwater in the way that humans do, because they would
have to expend a great deal of energy overcoming the powerful buoyancy
to get under the surface. Also, contrary to what you might expect, their
lungs are not huge, but they are very efficient indeed.
''When a whale comes to the surface, it expels air in a series of
short bursts and the plume is not water, but condensation of the warm
vapour as it meets the cold air. In several rapid blows it manages to
expel 90% of the contents, compared to about 10% in a human exhalation.
''Whale meat is very dark in colour, almost black, because of the
concentration of myoglobin, which is similar to haemoglobin, but is a
hugely efficient storer of oxygen. This allows the oxygen to stay in the
muscles to provide energy for movement. The lungs collapse under the
pressure down in the deep which prevents the whale suffering from the
bends.''
Because of their adaptations for a marine life and their ability to
store oxygen efficiently in the muscle tissue, sperm whales can go down
to tremendous depths to hunt for giant squid and stay submerged for 90
minutes. Almost, but not quite as spectacular as the bottlenose whale
which doesn't come up for breath for two hours. Fair takes your breath
away, doesn't it?
Kids, don't try this sort of thing at home. Humans can hold their
breath for little over two minutes. After that, things become a little
difficult. Permanently.

Who can tell the difference any more? asks Wendy Ormiston
ARE you firmly against artificial plants and believe that you have
never seen a natural-looking arrangement? The chances are that you just
haven't noticed. Forget the gaudy colours and plasticy stems that are
usually associated with man-made flowers. Modern manufacturing
techniques, and the clever use of greenery, means that you can achieve a
natural and low-maintenance arrangement that will last for years.
Inscape shops in Glasgow and Edinburgh stock a stunning selection of
flowers, foliage and even trees and have trained staff on hand to advise
you how to achieve the look you want.
Once you've explored the possibilities, you can let your artistic
talents take over. Formal A-line arrangements are no longer fashionable
and this suits artificial flowers superbly. Don't worry if you're not an
expert arranger, you have all the time in the world to experiment and
add to your arrangements to make the most of colour and texture.
''The secret is to keep it natural,'' says Inscape's managing director
Roger Woodford. ''You can't really go wrong if you stick to natural
flowers and colours.''
From poppies and daisies to lilies and sunflowers, the range available
allows you to create an arrangement standing a few feet tall or a small
centre piece for the dinner table. Roger recommends that you pick a
simple vase or container. ''Baskets are making a comeback and are ideal
for the natural look,'' he explains, but remember that a strongly
coloured vase can set off flowers very well -- use a bright blue glass
vase, for example, with deep blue, red and white anemones.
Many shops now stock a good selection of silk and polyester flowers.
John Lewis in Edinburgh have a wide range and you will also find them at
many good garden centres. If you want your arrangements to look really
natural, though, be sure to go for high quality flowers, even if they do
cost a little more.
Inscape stocks a range of baskets, pots and vases. The selection of
flowers and foliage on offer means that any look is at your fingertips.
And you do not have to be terribly creative to produce an attractive
piece. ''A simple lily in a tall glass vase with chestnut twigs can look
very striking,'' says Roger.
He maintains that you should not worry about changing seasonal
flowers. ''You should regard these arrangements as part of the room,
similar to a painting,'' he stresses. ''Natural style is timeless and
suits any type of home.'' If you would rather leave it all to the
experts Inscape will make up an arrangement for you. Their flower
arrangers are trained in texture, colour and artistry, rather than
traditional rigid designs.
Polyester flowers are natural looking, robust and easy to care for.
Roger recommends blowing arrangements with a cool hairdryer to rid them
of dust. ''With polyester kitchen greenery and flowering plants you may
wash them gently with Lux powder and rinse with fabric conditioner which
will reduce static. Leave them outside to dry on a breezy day and they
will be as good as new!''
When you are buying flowers, it is wise to check exactly how you
should care for them.
Conservatories, which are often too hot for certain plants, can be
transformed with fake greenery. Inscape's foliage and trees are ideal
and provide shade for natural plants. Add some colour with a scattering
of hanging baskets to complete the look.
There are no set rules about where and when you should use artificial
flowers. Even the diehard fresh flower arranger would agree that most
arrangements could benefit from some fake greenery or a few buds,
especially as the arrangement begins to fade and wither.
If you want to be really sneaky, plant a fake flower in a barren
plant. Roger tried this trick with his own orchid which hadn't flowered
in a couple of years. ''Within two weeks the plant produced flowers of
its own,'' he claims.

'I look at it and think: I'm
glad I bought that piece'
* NEW furniture versus old? ''I believe the public is divided into two
categories, those who are interested in antiques and those who are
interested in new furniture,'' says Ally Black, a director of Shapes of
Edinburgh, which started out in the business of cabinet-making 21 years
ago.
''To be perfectly honest,'' he confides, ''I don't buy antique
furniture, it can pong a wee bit of somebody's old house. I'd buy new.
It might be more expensive, but I'd spend the right money to get the
right article.''
Within its leafy setting in Colinton, Shapes occupies 24,000sq ft
crammed with an eclectic and beautiful selection of tasteful furniture.
''Mahogony is our biggest seller still -- nice tables, good sets of
chairs, occasional pieces,'' says Black, pointing to a superb satinwood
banded table with fine detail and finish, and the kind of patina which
suggests a century or two of dedicated elbow grease.
''That's in the #2000 range,'' he says. ''Look at the colour in that.
There are people in the reproduction business who sell nothing but crap.
See that new writing table over there -- the quality of it, the colour .
. . ''
Waxing lyrical, he raises a hand and waves expansively: ''This
magonony-veneered range with satinwood banding is made solely for us by
one guy.''
No-one could deny that the quality of many pieces displayed by Shapes
is quite superb and, to the lay eye, very hard to distinguish from fine
antique pieces, apart from the fact that they are clearly in pristine
condition. Spotting a handsome Bergere suite, he asks: ''Remember these?
Look at that canework.''
With its own cabinetworks in Chelmsford, Essex, Shapes also wholesales
in the south of England, making a large range of middle priced
furniture.
''The other talent we have here is for designing furniture and knowing
the best place to get it made,'' says Black. ''If it's a boardroom table
for a big office and someone wants a solid top, I know the best people
to make that. Another person might want an ornate veneered top, again we
know the specialist veneer people.
''Our job is to dream up that design, get it made, then we put it
together. It's like a Jaguar car, it's got wee bits that they buy from
different people. The furniture trade's exactly the same.''
Shapes has scaled down from 35 employees to nine, and in the past
couple of years has added auctioneering and valuation to its portfolio.
Its latest turnover, according to Black, has been #3m, with about
#700,000 of that coming from the auction side. It is headed by Richard
Longwill, who joined the company from one of the big auction houses.
''User-friendly is how we tried to make our auction rooms below the
showrooms,'' says Black. ''A lot of people are scared to approach big
auction houses, they can be a bit snobby. We have a major antique, fine
arts and silver auction every three months here.''
Antiques are often cheaper than top-quality reproduction, Black
believes. Shapes, he says, ''have to be a wee bit different. We can't
compete with the big, big guys. We have a niche market which is called
quality. People want more solid timbers in their lives, they're fed up
with man-made composites.''
Are they reacting against the uncertainties of life today? ''Could be.
But I bought a black grand piano the other day -- I'm learning to play
-- I look at it and think, I'm glad I bought that piece of furniture.
''Putting something nice into a room, looking at it and feeling happy
to have it -- that's a good feeling.''

* COVETING a Leonardo da Vinci or a Botticelli nowadays doesn't mean
you have to hope for a win on the lottery, writes BEVERLEY BROWN. Thanks
to modern photo reproduction processes, high-quality art in the form of
prints has come well within everyone's budget.
Prints are essential decorations, an inexpensive way to add character
and atmosphere to a home. Everything from the bizarre to the Byzantine
is available to transform a plain, featureless room into one which
reflects the owner's taste and personal style in as long as it takes to
put a hook in the wall.
Limited-edition prints, however, can be confusing. Basically,
photomechanical reproduction is capable of producing a vast number of
prints at the touch of a button. Using the same process, a limited
edition means that the print run is reduced to a certain number which
the artist signs by hand in the margin. These should not be confused
with original works of art drawn by an artist and printed by hand.
There can be several editions of an original print but these are
usually very limited in number, hence the term ''original limited
print''. The latter can be seen at the Glasgow Print Studio, an arts
organisation with charitable status founded in 1972 to encourage the art
of printmaking. Its workshop provides a unique environment where famous
artists work alongside students and members who come to use the studio's
printmaking facilities from all over the world.
Jillian Booth, 28, is a Canadian artist currently working at the
Glasgow Print Studio and preparing for an exhibition in the King Street
gallery in June. Jillian's prime medium is printmaking, mainly from
stone lithography and etchings. Working directly on to large blocks of
limestone, she then manually reproduces up to five prints.
Scottish-based artist Jennie Tuffs is also expanding her print range,
but she has opted to use photomechanical reproduction on a large scale.
Her paintings of flowers have been widely exhibited around the world and
published on greeting cards, but it gives her more pleasure to know that
affordable, quality prints of her work are available for people to enjoy
at a fraction of the cost of an original painting.
So who collects prints? Daniel Shakleton has been a picture dealer for
30 years. He is an advocate of prints as a decorative, inexpensive means
of turning a house into a home. His own home in the Fife village of
Aberdour demonstrates his belief that prints should be bought, like all
art, because you like the image.
And then you should be creative. The stairs and hallway in Daniel's
home are a profusion of coats of arms (not his), walking sticks and top
hats, and black and white silhouettes. One wall has been covered in
portrait engravings.
''I love them all -- and they reflect my character, which is exactly
how prints should be used,'' he says. ''I hate the present trend of
having a home or a room done from top to bottom by an interior designer.
My immediate reaction to the client would be: That's someone else
imposing their taste on you -- what's wrong with your own taste?
''If someone likes botanical prints, that's fine; if they like wacky
prints, that's also fine. I once saw a ghastly room in a restaurant take
on a completely new character by the simple addition of some prints with
quirky captions added underneath. The result was instant atmosphere that
also made customers laugh. That's what prints are all about.''
Some prints can appreciate in value, although Daniel Shakleton
believes that if they are produced as a photomechanical process, they
shouldn't. One of the most collectable artists in the print market is
Sir William Russell Flint, whose signed limited edition prints can now
fetch high prices. But should prints be bought as an investment?
''Never,'' says Daniel. ''Forget about investment. You can have good
modern prints of an old picture which, in an old frame, looks great.
Given the choice between one expensive picture or dozens of prints, the
latter are usually far more enjoyable and will do more for your home.''
But it might be prudent to advise the children to keep their posters;
one of Charles Rennie Mackintosh's posters for The Glasgow Institute of
Fine Art sold at auction in 1993 for over #68,000 and rates as a
reproduction record.

A Finnish envoy
gives his verdict
to AILEEN LITTLE
* FINNISH consul and trade commissioner to Scotland Pertti Rajamaki
reckons it's quite appropriate he has spent his five-year term of office
in an Edinburgh new town flat with Charles Rennie Mackintosh
connections.
The garden flat, owned by antiques dealer Alan Day, has been rented
out to a succession of Finnish consuls. They appreciate not only its
proximity to the George Street consulate -- but also the white
''Mackintosh'' bedroom which Day had designed like the one in Hill
House, Edinburgh.
''Being an engineer, I'm very interested in houses and architecture,''
says Mr Rajamaki, who has a few months left of his posting to Edinburgh.
His wife, a lawyer, continues her work in Finland.
The master bedroom, complete with CRM's famously uncomfortable
ladderback chairs, rose motif and Glasgow Style clock, represents the
characteristic synthesis of past and present familiar to arts and crafts
devotees.
Pertti, the only consul outside London with a paid post, is now an
ardent CRM fan. ''The bedroom is far from practical, though it is
stylish.''
He much prefers the work of celebrated Finnish architect-designer
Alvar Aalto, who was at his peak in the thirties. ''My wife and I are
collecting furniture by Aalto,'' explains Pertti, who is particularly
proud of a trolley with storage basket, a dining suite and a ladder-top
table.
Interestingly Aalto, whose designs are available at branches of
Inhouse, was a Mackintosh disciple. For a time Aalto worked as assistant
to one of Finland's foremost arts and crafts exponents, Eliel Saarinen,
who designed a country house, Hvittrask, for himself, 15 miles west of
Helsinki. It is a place of pilgrimage for students of architectural
movements. In fact, the Finnish embassy in London is shortly to take the
UK's 16 honorary consuls and their wives there on a visit.
Saarinen was a friend of Mackintosh, and the Finn designed for his
children a nursery indistinguishable from the Glasgow Style.
Pertti Rajamaki recently bought his own country mansion in Finland, an
impressive lakeside pile he describes as 'nouveau classical'. It stands
less then 10 miles from the Hvittrask Museum. ''Having had this flat I
went to see it again recently, to look at the Mackintosh resemblance,''
says Pertti.
Finnish consuls are expected to possess business expertise with a view
to establishing trade links. As an electronics engineeer and former
managing director of a forklift truck company, Pertti and his staff of
four concentrate on electronics and health care.
''We pick up companies in Finland because we are knowledgeable about
market opportunities in the UK as a whole. I travel regularly in
Finland, visiting and evaluating companies. We bring 15 companies a year
to the UK, 50% to Scotland. Compared with other consul offices, we are
leading the field.''
Appropriately, it was a Scotsman, Crichton of Crichton of Vulcan fame,
who founded the famous shipyard in Turku, Pertti's home town; Finlayson
textiles is another big name.
When Pertti finally returns to his homeland he intends taking
something British with him. He doesn't mean the Harley bike he bought in
Scotland and which, through membership of the Dunedin Club, has won him
many friends.
He is referring to his taste for Smallbone fitted furnishings. He
intends creating a library with similar ''Georgian'' facings in his own
country house. It should bring back happy memories. ''I've spent the
best years of my life here,'' says Pertti. ''I even met the Queen.''

It was once a word for 'not so good'. But reproduction has won new
respect. The pursuit of quality has prompted the change, and
representing a case in point is a new generation of Glasgow Boys who --
writes Alexandra Kay -- are giving the much-abused designs of Charles
Rennie Mackintosh a new lease of life
* CHARLES RENNIE MACKINTOSH'S legacy as an architect, designer,
painter and craftsman has inspired a vast reproduction industry at home
and abroad. Now Anniesland College in Glasgow is training a new
generation of Glasgow Boys who are taking on European manufacturers in a
bid to prove Scottish superiority in the reproduction of Mackintosh's
furniture design.
The college runs the only SCOTVEC National Certificate in Mackintosh
furniture design and construction in Scotland, now in its second year.
Students are recreating chairs, cabinets, mirrors and windows from
original Mackintosh designs. Ash and oak are used extensively in the
construction of many pieces and completing a single chair can take a
student eight months of painstaking dedication.
Eric Byrne is the course organiser and joint founder. ''The college
had been running very successful general furniture making courses and
was looking to diversify,'' he says.
''At this point, Donald Judge, the previous course organiser, and I
put our heads together and developed a course specifically aimed at
making furniture Mackintosh style, which SCOTVEC accredited. The chairs
the students produced last year were of such excellent quality that we
have now incorporated cabinets, mirrors and windows.''
The ages of students on the course varies widely. Many of the present
students were unemployed and are now acquiring a practical skill which
will enhance their creative talents as well as their job prospects. Most
will have their fees paid by Strathclyde Regional Council in the form of
a bursary and, though there are no fixed material costs, students might
be asked to purchase specialised materials depending on the work they
undertake during the course.
Since qualifying, three students have successfully become
self-employed: Martin Burrish (35), Tony Martin (26) and Mathew
McIntyre. All have extremely healthy order books. Mathew has
concentrated on Mackintosh's high-back chair design which he constructs
in metal and modestly admits it is ''very popular''.
Lack of competition has allowed Italian furniture makers Cassini to
corner the Mackintosh market in recent years. John Dryburgh (36), a
student on the course, says: ''The quality and standard of Cassini
furniture is not particularly high and I think there's plenty of room
for new entrants to this market. I believe the production of Mackintosh
furniture should be encouraged in Scotland, with more college courses
and employment opportunies.
''After all, Mackintosh's original works were designed for use in
Scotland.''
Like most of the students who are on, or have completed the course,
John was an admirer of Mackintosh -- but he admits that the course has
given him new insight and appreciation into what he now sees as ''the
softness in Mackintosh's designs''.
Anniesland College is now hoping the results of the course will gain
wider recognition; students have been asked to submit three chairs to
the SCOTVEC offices in Glasgow. The high-back chairs will form part of a
display at a SCOTVEC exhibition to be visited by The Duke of Edinburgh
later this year -- and the students are hoping he may be tempted to try
one out.
The college has also received an invitation to send students on a
visit to Le CFA La Bonne Graine, the Paris university which specialises
in furniture-making courses and degrees. And a selection of chairs
produced by students past and present are to be taken by Andrew Stone,
of the Burrell Collection, to the USA to raise awareness of Glasgow as
the City of Architecture in 1999.
The most recent sale of an original Mackintosh high-back chair
achieved over #210,000. At prices ranging from a more modest #300, these
Glasgow Boys are bringing Mackintosh's designs well within the reach of
his ain folk.
* A selection of chairs will be displayed at Anniesland College in the
Balshagray Annexe, Broomhill Avenue, on Saturday, June 3. For details,

THE managers will pay the usual lip service, hoping it will be a game
to savour, a great Scottish finale to show off to the world, a delight
to the eye. Nonsense, of course. They want one thing, to win. If it is a
nice one, fine; if not, c'est la vie.
This is how it always has been, of course, because at this stage of
the country's major cup competition no manager is able to envisage any
other priority than seeing his own team enjoy the celebrations that are
the winners' right at the end of the last and biggest single game of the
season.
For the players and supporters, there will not even be lip service to
the niceties of the occasion. You don't pay #17 to #20 for a ticket to
come home with aesthetic appreciation of a fine afternoon's play. We're
gonna win the cup and nothing else will do.
For the rest of us, however, the climax of the 1994-95 term could do a
little something to redress the balance of a season that has been
notable for its mediocrity.
It would be a fine time to come up with a good Scottish Cup final, as
foreigners of all description will be looking in to see if the stories
they are hearing about the poverty of our game are true. Inevitably, now
that the two finals are staged on separate weekends, comparison with the
FA Cup final will take place, and after the Everton-Manchester United
show there really is not all that much to beat.
Some Celtic fans may think precisely that about their team's task
today, but that would be a dangerous tack to pursue, especially as the
Parkhead lot have no recent trophy-winning track record of their own to
offer as evidence of their superiority.
More than that, however, is the fact that Celtic will be taking on
perhaps the most experienced team that has ever played in a Scottish Cup
final. The likely side that manager Alex MacDonald will send on to
Hampden this afternoon are in what is best called the mature stage of
their football lives, 28 and over.
In fact, there is probably nothing more dangerous than a team of
players who know that this is likely to be Last Chance Afternoon,
particularly when MacDonald, claims that the overall feeling among his
troops is thus: ''We are just happy to be there.'' If you believe that,
you backed the Tories to win Perth and Kinross.
Celtic seem certain to be without a player who has been very much a
star turn for them this season, defender Brian O'Neil, who suffered a
knee twist in training, although manager Tommy Burns yesterday was still
willing to give him more time.
The manager is saying nothing about his decisions if O'Neil is out but
it may be that, with Peter Grant fit, he will use the versatile Rudi
Vata alongside Tommy Boyd in central defence, with Grant taking up an
attacking right back role. Up front he has to decide if Willie Falconer,
Andy Walker or Simon Donnnelly will partner Pierre van Hooydonk. It
could be that the fresh legs of Donnelly will be given preference.
For my money, the Celtic midfield hold the key to the outcome. If the
classy John Collins, who might well revel in the splendour of the
occasion, Paul McStay and Phil O'Donnell play to their form they ought
to be too inventive for Airdrie, but I believe it will still be a
close-run thing.

ROY Laidlaw and I got into our little hired car and drove the sunny
half mile through Cape Town's spacious, leafy suburbs to Rondebosch
school, an all-boy affair that looks like something out of paradise. It
is Government-aided, but parents contribute #400 a year to give the
school an edge.
An open-air pool, miles of open space and rugby pitches, a gym that
makes health clubs in Scotland look shabby, and acres of all-weather
surfaces combined to make us feel decidedly ordinary.
''Look at all that Jock,'' says Roy. ''How do we ever compete with
these people.'' Roy is fact-finding, as you all know, and he wants to
find out how they develop rugby in South Africa, and in the beautiful
Western Cape in particular.
We are met by Spencer King, a Currie Cup referee, who is deputy
headmaster and head of sport at Rondebosch, and the man is laden down
with video cassettes. ''We video and then edit all of our first XV
games,'' says King, ''and we study them after I have put a commentary on
them. Come, I'll show you round the place.''
We follow dutifully like schoolchildren. Just as we go out into the
bright sunshine again -- it's midwinter remember -- 20 or so youngsters,
barefoot and clad only in white shorts, come running past us clutching a
rugby ball. ''What's happening?'' asks Roy. ''Simple,'' says King.
''This is one of the PE periods, and we give the boys the option as to
what they want to do. They all want to play touch rugby.''
We blink a little. What we then witness is this group of lithe,
healthy under-16s play the most consummate touch rugby game you could
ever see. In bare feet, for goodness sake.
''They all look athletic,'' says Roy. ''They are,'' confirms King.
''Most of them are competitive swimmers as well. Our summer sports
include water polo, and they all make use of the gym two or three times
a week.
''We have a group of older boys who supervise the younger ones in
weight training. And they choose to play in bare feet as they prefer
it.'' We look at the twigs and hard grass on the pitch and conclude that
these are tough young kids all right.
Rondebosch is the school that formulated the playing style that the
world witnessed on Thursday as Joel Stransky, a South African
try-scorer, strutted his stuff at Newlands. Stransky is a former pupil,
and rugby means much to the old boys, and the parents.
That brings its pressures. ''Most people seem to think that if the
rugby is doing well then the school is doing well,'' says the head of
sport. ''I was brought in last year to the school only because they
hadn't beaten their great rivals, Bishops, for 10 years.''
If Rondebosch looks like something from paradise, then Bishops looks
made in heaven. We should know, as me and Roy train there every morning.
''The result of Rondebosch not having won for 10 years was that two
teachers resigned from coaching the team in four years after former
pupils and parents were asking what had gone wrong. We have now won the
last two games.''
The school's set-up is interesting, in that on any one match-day
Rondebosch puts out 17 different sides in league matches, but the
leagues have no result at the end of the season. ''In this part of the
country -- and it is different in Transvaal where it is win at all cost
-- whether you play in the top league or not depends entirely on how
many teams you are able to field,'' says King. ''There are no winners
and no losers at the end of the season. We want to breed rugby players
who can run, pass, and tackle. We measure our success on the number of
players who stay in the game after school. Most of them do. We teach a
love of the game.''
Roy looks at the youngsters run around. All of the fields are now
covered in a wide assortment of children playing rugby. ''These,'' he
says under his breath, ''are the best natural players I've ever seen in
my life Jock.''
The boys get up a sweat in the sun. They look like American swimmers,
every one of them. We get back in our car as it's time to go to an
Aussie press conference. We wonder at it all. We have now both written
back home to go back to school. This place is paradise.

Wentworth
NICK Faldo yesterday filled his anticipated role as the prodigal
returned to the European Tour which made him -- and which he, of course,
repaid by his immense contribution to its healthy development. He
celebrated renewed acquaintance with a 67, five under par, in the first
round of the Volvo PGA Championship at Wentworth.
On that score he was joined by Bernhard Langer, but even this
formidable pair were upstaged by Peter Senior. The stocky Australian
incorporated six 3s in eight holes from the ninth, four for birdies, as
he wielded his long-handled putter to consistent effect, continuing a
year that has been exceptionally rewarding.
Senior has had victories in Australia and Japan and also finished in
the first 15 in two European tournaments, yet he continues to compete
only because he enjoys doing so. Although not technically a millionaire,
Senior intends selling out in October his interest in what he describes
as ''an up-market pawnbrokers.'' Even then retirement is unlikely.
Few know the idiosyncrasies of the 6957-yard West course better than
Faldo. He has, for example, won one of his four PGA titles here and two
World Matchplay championships, but in a swirling breeze he tried ''to
make myself feel I'd never played it before, to keep myself awake and
concentrate on what I'm doing.''
Certainly, the bounce-and-run game and hard greens bore no resemblance
to the lush conditions prevalent on the US Tour, whence Faldo has
briefly returned after almost four months campaigning there. But unlike
too many of his European contemporaries Faldo retains the dedication and
drive to succeed at the highest levels -- which his finish exemplified.
After chopping a pulled drive out of trouble at the 571-yard
seventeenth he almost made a fifth birdie by hitting a No.2 iron to 15
feet, whereupon he signed off with a flourish at the 502-yard last,
where he hit a No.3-iron shot of 223 yards to 12 feet for an eagle -- as
if he had never been away.
Langer, who has won the championship twice at Wentworth, found shots
difficult to hold near flagsticks, especially if they were played from
rough. But he made his score at the long holes, five under for the four
of them, starting with an eagle 3 at the 501-yard downhill fourth with a
No.3 wood to eight feet.
Jesper Parnevik, runner-up in last year's Open Championship, the 1993
Scottish Open champion, and in the group on 68, thought that the key to
his score was the three successive birdies he made from the third when
the wind was at its most difficult. Not that he was anxious to disown
his eagle 3 at the twelfth, from a No.5 iron to 10 feet.
Colin Montgomerie and Gary Orr led the 15-strong Scottish contingent
on 70, but their reactions were in marked contrast. The former
complained: ''My holing out is not what it should be. I can't make a
score and it's getting to me.'' The latter, struggling this year, almost
gratefully declared: ''Instead of mixing the good with the destructive,
I kept it tidy.''
Gordon Brand Jr simply hung on for his 73 after having gone two over
in the first three holes whereas Paul Lawrie birdied three of the last
six for the same score.

Scotland 89, Ivory Coast 0
SCOTLAND have begun their World Cup campaign with a flurry of records
and by the end of a ruthless, 13-try rout, the Rustenburg stadium had
become the Elephants' graveyard.
Gavin Hastings, the record-breaker in chief, completed his day with an
interview session conducted by a host of school-children from
Rustenburg's Grenville High. Fairytales at bed-time would have been an
appropriate theme.
Throughout the week the Scotland management had been playing a canny
game of talking-up the opposition. On the day Ivory Coast were as
untutored as those of us who saw them in training expected them to be.
Maybe not too much should be read into Scotland's demolition job --
Tonga and France will provide sterner tests -- but, to their credit, the
Scots did display the ruthlessness which coach Dougie Morgan had
demanded and, as Hastings said later, one of the most pleasing aspects
of the match was that Scotland maintained their concentration throughout
and did not leak any points.
Hastings, with four tries and 44 points to his name, was, of course,
the star of the show. As he said later, he knew it that it might well be
his day when the ball -- seemingly radio-controlled -- bounced into his
open arms and he crashed over for the opening try.
Hastings aside, though, there were others who will be well pleased
with their afternoon's work.
Peter Walton, back from injury, grafted for his two tries and Kenny
Logan, looking ravenously try-hungry, took his brace well and laid on a
third.
Craig Chalmers' try, a charge-down affair, was merely the icing on an
extremely appetising cake. The fly-half was a commanding presence behind
Bryan Redpath and the deftness of his running promises much for the days
ahead.
So comprehensive was the rout that both props found themselves among
the tries. They will be drummed out of the front-row union if this
continues, Paul Burnell the more so as, unlike Peter Wright, he had to
steam all of 20 metres for his! Coach Dougie Morgan said later that the
Scots had waited so long for their entrance on to the world stage that
the first 20 minutes was always going to be a tentative period.
''Both sides were nervous at the start but then Gavin started the ball
rolling and it went on from there,'' he said.
The near capacity 31,000-strong crowd -- with most of them rooting for
Scotland -- provided a real Caledonian backdrop to the occasion.
Hastings said: ''No matter where you go in the world you find that the
Scots come out to support you. It was fantastic to see all those
Saltires and Lions Rampant out there today. That is absolutely fantastic
when you are so far from home and that is going to be very important for
us during the next couple of games.''
The captain, who will retire from international rugby once the world
cup campaign has ended, played down the personal role he played in the
Scottish victory.
''I've always said that the team performance is more important than
that of the individual and that's exactly what I told the guys at
half-time.''
The final word must rest with Ivory Coast vice-captain Jean Sathicq.
''We knew from the start that Gavin Hastings was a very great player and
we spent the whole of the first half looking at him.'' Scorers:
Gavin Hastings, 4 tries, nine conversions, two penalty goals. Craig
joiner, try. Tony Stanger, try. Kenny Logan, two tries. Craig Chalmers,
try. Peter Walton, two tries. Peter Wright, try. Paul Burnell, try.

GOOD news has been scarce in the Aberdeen zone for much of the season,
but their fans, still high on the play-off win over Dunfermline which
secured their premier division place next term, were given a double doze
of that welcome medicine yesterday when Tommy Craig was appointed as
first-team coach and star youngster Stephen Wright indicated he might
stay put at Pittodrie, writes Ian Paul.
Craig, who has been assistant to three managers at Parkhead, left the
club after Tommy Burns reconstructed the backroom staff, plans to
continue as the Scotland Under-21 manager. He was the first #100,000
teenager when he was signed from Aberdeen by Sheffield Wednesday 26
years ago and described his appointment as ''like coming home.''
He went on: ''It is a special move for me to return to where my career
started and where I know so many people. I worked with Roy Aitken at
Celtic and we are very much on the same wavelength. In terms of
leadership, I don't see the guy having any equal. He has always had this
ability, even when playing badly himself, to rise above it and lift
others.
''He is now managing as he played, in a very positive manner. He is
also very supportive of those around him. Just look at his record of
success. That speaks volumes about him. He lives by the motto that
nothing is impossible.''
Former assistant manager Drew Jarvie will take over the expansion of
the Pittodrie youth development programme.
Wright, the 22-year-old who had been expected to join Rangers in a
#1.5m deal, is out of contract next month but said yesterday: ''It is
rubbish to suggest I have played my last game for Aberdeen. When Roy
Aitken took over as manager there were more important issues to worry
about. I now plan to get down to some hard talking with the manager to
see if they want me to stay. There is a chance I will be with Aberdeen
next season.''

PART-TIME artist Peter Martin added his own unmistakable touch of
class after England's batsmen had produced a masterpiece at The Oval
yesterday. Lancashire lad Martin watched as county team-mates Mike
Atherton and Neil Fairbrother gave the West Indian bowlers their biggest
one-day caning of all time -- with a fair slice of help from Graeme
Hick.
Then the 26-year-old fast bowler celebrated his senior England debut
by dismissing Sherwin Campbell, Jimmy Adams and, best of all, Brian Lara
in the space of 17 unforgettable deliveries, and fiishig with figures of
four for 44.
Skipper Atherton tossed him the ball with West Indies roaring along at
68 for one, and Lara well set on 30. Half an hour later, Martin's
amazing figures read 4-0-6-3 -- and England's record-breaking total of
306 for five was beyond reach, despite a valiant attempt by the
tourists.
A 25-run victory squared the three-match Texaco series, setting up
tomorrow's encounter at Lord's as the decider.
But even with Atherton's one-day international best of 92, Hick's 66,
and Fairbrother's controversy-tinged 61, West Indies still gave England
a fright. And they might have scored an astonishing win but for
man-of-the-match Martin.
He stepped up to have Campbell caught off a leading edge at mid-on
with his fifth ball and then trapped Adams leg before. But the 6ft 4in
paceman saved his best delivery for King Brian.
Martin made sure of instant star status by returning late on to clean
bowl Curtly Ambrose and then force Junior Murray into a fatal run out
mistake as West Indies were dismissed for 281 with two overs remaining.
It was skipper Atherton who led from the front as England soared
beyond 300 for only the seventh time in 233 one-day internationals --
and West Indies conceded more runs than ever before at this form of
cricket.

TROUBLED footballer Duncan Ferguson found international team manager
Craig Brown ready to stand by him yesterday when he named the Scotland
squad for the European Championship game against the Faroe Islands on
June 7.
Ferguson, who had been sentenced to three months in prison just 24
hours earlier -- a verdict which is now under appeal -- was not in the
20-strong party of players.
But Brown, questioned about his absence, declared: ''Duncan Ferguson
is not named because he has played so little football over the past two
or three months.
''I know he played in the FA Cup final for Everton, but only in the
second half, and before that he had just one reserve game following his
operation. So the only reason he is out is because he lacks the match
sharpness we would want for this game.
''As regards the future, Duncan remains in my plans.''
Another striker who faced problems, Chelsea's John Spencer, sent off
in Japan, is also out. But Brown stressed this was not for disciplinary
reasons: ''He needed games to sharpen up after being injured.
''When he was sent off he had played for just 34 minutes, and we
cannot take him into a European Championship match with so little
preparation.''
Brown has retained three of the youngsters who broke through on the
Japanese tour, Paul Bernard of Oldham, Craig Burley of Chelsea, and Scot
Gemmill of Notts Forrest. Squad:
Bernard (Oldham), Boyd (Celtic), Burley (Chelsea), Calderwood
(Tottenham), Collins (Celtic), Gemmill (Nottm Forest), Jackson
(Hibernian), Leighton (Hibernian), McGinlay (Bolton), McKimmie
(Aberdeen), McKinlay (Dundee United), McKinnon (Motherwell), McLaren
(Rangers), McStay (Celtic), Martin (Motherwell), Nevin (Tranmere),
Robertson (Hearts), Shearer (Aberdeen), Walker (Partick), Woods
(Motherwell).

THERE'S still a lot we can improve on, but it was good to get the
first game out of the way.
I was desperate for tries -- I've got to keep myself in contention
with Jackie Joiner after all -- and I managed to get a couple.
It was good, too, to be able to do some creative running and lay on a
try for Gavin Hastings, not that he needed much assistance the way he
was playing.
The boys have been calling him 'Roy of the Rovers' and that was
another instalment in a Boys' Own story that just seems to go on and on.
It really makes a winger's day when he can get among the tries. That's
what we're there for, after all.
I enjoyed the first one. I gave a wee bit of a shimmy and burst
through the hole. The second one was really just a support try, but they
all count and I'm happy.
We took a while to get into our stride but, once we had achieved a bit
of control, we played some good rugby.
The wives and girlfriends will be coming down to the hotel in Pretoria
tonight from Sun City and, we may allow ourselves a wee bit of a party.

DOUG Rougvie is the new player-manager of Highland League club Huntly.
The former Aberdeen, Chelsea and Scotland defender bounces back into
management as successor to Steve Paterson, who this week joined
Caledonian Thistle.
Rougvie, who won a European Cup-winners' Cup winners' medal with
Aberdeen in 1983, has been a major player in Huntly's two successive
Highland League titles. He was disillusioned with football after having
been sacked as manager of Montrose, but later become an influential rock
in the formidable Huntly set-up.
The 39-year-old full back is no stranger to success, with two premier
division medals, three Scottish Cup medals, and one international cap,
against Northern Ireland in 1983, under his belt. His career also took
him to Brighton, Shrewsbury, Fulham and Dunfermline.
Rougvie sees his second crack at management as a ''natural
progression,'' but he is determined to keep playing. He said: ''It is a
fantastic job, the best in the Highland game, but it is important to me
to keep on playing. There is nothing better than pulling on the boots,
and I am better placed on the field to relay information to players.''

France 38, Tonga 10
FRANCE opened their World Cup campaign with victory over unfancied
Tonga, although they only clicked into top gear in the last 15 minutes
of an otherwise scrappy Pool D match in Pretoria.
Tonga flanker Feleti Mahoni became only the fifth player to be sent
off in World Cup history when he was dismissed in the sixty-eighth
minute by English referee Steve Lander. It was not immediately clear for
what offence, although it was believed he had raked flanker Phillippe
Benetton during a ruck.
For most of the 80 minutes France repeated the unhappy form of their
Five Nations' Championship campaign, but in the final quarter they ran
in four tries, two of them scored by centre Thierry Lacroix, who
accounted for a total of 25 points, against one try by centre Tevita
Va'enuku in injury time.
Tonga full back Sateki Tu'ipulotu finished with one successful penalty
out of six attempts.
France, leading 6-0 at the interval, were sparked into life by a
Lacroix try in the twenty-fourth minute, diving into the corner with an
outstretched hand after a jinxing run from a maul.
Scrum half Aubin Hueber dotted down seven minutes later, and in a move
starting near the half-way line most of the backs handled before Laurent
Cabannes, who came on for the injured Marc Cecillon, flicked the final
pass to captain Phillipe Saint Andre.
Lacroix scored once more in the final minute of regular time.
Canada 34, Romania 3
CANADIAN captain Gareth Rees inspired his team to victory over Romania
in their Pool A match in Port Elizabeth.
Rees scored 19 points from the boot and helped set up three tries to
put Canada level on top of the section with South Africa after the first
round of matches.
Prop Rod Snow scored after 20 minutes as he ran in off driving play by
the Canadians. Flanker Al Charron capped a fine running movement with a
try midway through the second half, and No.8 Colin McKenzie added a
third soon after, while Romania's only points came from a penalty by
fly-half Nicolae Nichitean.

have the whole close season to go away and mope about it'
TOMMY BOYD
TWO men will run on to the Hampden pitch today with clear memories of
the time they captained their teams in Tennents Scottish Cup finals, yet
neither will be in charge this afternoon.
Tommy Boyd, undoubtedly a key figure in the Celtic side, is not the
club captain, as he was when he led Motherwell to their memorable
victory over Dundee United in the final of 1991; Sandy Stewart will give
way to captain Jimmy Sandison this time, unlike 1992 when he had to
deputise for the Airdrie skipper as his team lost 2-1 to Rangers in the
final.
Considering how few of the Celtic side have experienced a Scottish Cup
final, Boyd's track record ought to be useful, and not just because he
will be able to describe to Paul McStay that inimitable feeling when the
team captain walks up the steps and lifts the trophy high.
Stewart, on the other hand, can only transmit the sensation he
relished of leading the team on the field, but the Airdrie man has a
genuine desire to see his team-mate do what he didn't manage, hold the
cup aloft.
Boyd knows only too well the contrasting emotions that are awaiting
the teams in cup finals. He was in the Celtic side that lost to Raith
Rovers in the Coca-Cola Cup final last November. ''The feeling I had
when we won with Motherwell was one thing, but the way I felt after
losing to Raith was another. I know which I would rather have on
Saturday.
''It was bad enough losing in November, but if you lose this week you
have the whole close season to go away and mope about it.
''When we won with Motherwell, even although it was my last game for
the club, it was a tremendously satisfying feeling, with people shaking
your hand and congratulating you in the street. I don't think I can
compare the way winning will feel until it happens, but with Motherwell
I had the extra responsibility of being captain. With Celtic the players
are bound to get a feeling of release if they win after all the pressure
over the past few years.''
Unlike many of his team's supporters and neutral observers, Boyd does
not believe for a second that Airdrie will be beaten comfortably. ''I am
sure it will be a lot closer than some people think. Airdrie are a good
team and did well when they beat Hearts in the semi-final.''
Even so, Boyd feels that in the Coca-Cola final Celtic maybe paid just
a bit too much respect to Rovers. ''I think we need to start quickly and
set the tone of the game ourselves. It can be very difficult if a team
score and get behind the ball. We saw that in the FA Cup final, when a
team of Manchester United's quality could not get back at Everton.''
When he arrived at Parkhead with that cup medal in his possession, the
international defender, who went to Chelsea after that Motherwell win,
did not imagine that he would still be without a match for it
three-and-a-half years later. ''You would have thought that coming here
I would have been at least getting to finals, but until this season it
hasn't happened. Maybe we can rectify if all by winning the cup now.''
Boyd's first game for Celtic was against Airdrie, when his team won
2-0. He would settle for a similar scoreline this time, but he and his
colleagues should beware a determined and genuinely confident first
division side, if Sandy Stewart is a guide.
''All the boys think that maybe this is our year. This is our
fourteenth cup-tie of the season and we have lost only one, on penalties
to Raith Rovers in the semi-final of the Coca-Cola Cup.''
Stewart has been doing his own homework on Celtic, watching them on a
few occasions since the two teams got through to today's final. ''Celtic
definitely blow hot and cold. I saw them against Hibs in the semi-final
and I thought they were outstanding, but I saw them again against
Partick Thistle four days before they beat Rangers and I thought they
were very, very ordinary. Maybe that is how their season has gone this
year. I just hope they are on one of their 'cold' days on Saturday.''
His memories of the '92 final are mainly on the overture rather than
the symphony, but that, as he says, is mainly because Airdrie lost. ''I
was told the week before that I would be taking over as captain from
Jimmy Sandison, who was suspended, but I had a wee inkling I would be
doing it when the previous week the manager gave me the ball and told me
to lead out the team against St Johnstone. It was a dream come true and
leading the lads on to Hampden was a fantastic experience. The day
simply flew in.
''I will be just as nervous about this one, but the experience will do
us a lot of good when we get started. All the pressure is on Celtic and
I reckon they will be even more nervous.''
Stewart is convinced that if his team can score in the first half they
will have a great chance of winning. ''I think we are more confident
this time simply because before the last game Rangers were firing on all
cylinders. Even then I think we only got going after we had lost two
goals.''

YACHTING
IN 20 years of Scotland's biggest annual sailing event the number of
opening offshore races from Gourock to Tarbert which have enjoyed
unbroken progress from start gun to finish gun could be counted on one
hand.
The Rover Series' opening race finished with the first Scottish boat
tied up in Tarbert at just after eight o'clock yesterday morning -- but,
true to form, there were two major light wind traps which snared entire
fleets, delaying their departure from the Clyde by up to two hours.
Escaping quickly from these calms was the passport to certain success
as was underlined by the top seeded past winners of the five-day
regatta's major trophy who finished at the head of their respective
classes.
In Class 0 the early pace was dictated by Regatta Team Scotland's IOR
50-footer, McLeod's Isle of Skye. Steered by Gourock's Ian Marshall, the
proposed Admiral's Cup contenders believe they were 25 minutes ahead of
the next boat on reaching Hamilton Rock, off Arran -- one third of the
way into the 75-mile race.
On the 32-mile downwind haul to Portavadie, 1990 Series Trophy winner
Geoffrey Howison, in his new Australian-built BHB 41 Local Hero X,
reeled the leaders in and went on to triumph in Class 0 by a comfortable
19 minutes.
Three-times series winner Jonathan Anderson scored a maiden race
victory in Class 1 in his new Beneteau 42 seven, while in the Sonata
Class 1993 trophy winner Steve Goacher, sailing Eric The Boat, won by
over seven minutes. Results (Gourock to Tarbert):
Class 0 -- 1, Local Hero X (G Howison) 14hr 45min; 2, Assassin (H and
M Griffith) 15-04.00; 3, Crackerjack (K Miller) 15-18.12.
Class 1 -- 1, Duckwall Pooley (J Anderson) 14-48.30; 2, Eclipse V (A
Duffus) 14-51.43; 3, Corwynt Cymru III (G Evans) 14-52.29.
Class 2 -- 1, Cahoots (J Killeen) 14-42.02; 2, Scarlet Fever (P
Foulds) 14-44.39; 3, Jumpin Jack Flash (S Moorhouse) 14-46.38.
Class 3 -- 1, Owl (P Bruce) 12-41.33; 2, Enigma (H Morrison) 12-53.46;
3, Naiad III (J Kelly) 12-56.12.
Class 4 -- 1, Valhalla of Ashton (A and F Dunnet) 12-46.31; 2, Starlet
(D Murray) 12-48.19; 3, Lightspeed (R Houghton) 12-51.25.
Class 5 -- 1, Crusader II (J Highcock)9-35.12; 2, Scanne (G Aikman)
9-55.00; 3, Sea-Quin (M Broadbent) 10-09.00.
Class 6: 1, Good Krack (D Forbes) 10.27.05, 2, Lindisfarne II (J
Pearson) 10.33.06, 3, Weekend Warrior (R Boyle) 10.33.14.
Class 7 -- 1, Kumallie (C Moore) 7-42.11; 2, Southern Comfort (B
Bocker) 7-567.29; 3, Midnight Star (E Forster) 7-56.30.
Sigma 33 -- 1, White Lightning (Fitzgerald/Jackson) 13-25.27; 2,
Phoenix (J Connelly) 13-26.28; 3, Makin Waves (K Aitken) 13-28.48.
Sonata -- 1, Eric The Boat (S Goacher) 12-09.24; 2, Saraband (D Clark)
12-16.57; 3, Kooshtie (G Campbell) 12-25.09.
Bangor to Tarbert: Sigma 33 -- 1, Sula of Arne (A Dean). Class 0 --
Sidewinder (D Best). Class 1 -- Mustang Sally (P Wilson). Class 2 --

SUE Lawrie produced one of her finest performances for Scotland last
night against world champions Australia in the three nations tournament
at Lisburn in Northern Ireland.
But it was not enough to prevent the Aussies winning 3-1 on what had
promised to be a historical day.
Earlier, Scotland defeated Ireland 4-0, and after some superb play in
the opening 15 minutes against Australia, Scotland could havescored a
double victory on the same day.
The Aussies struck after 18 minutes when Michelle Andrews was left
unmarked on the 25-yard line at a corner. The ball was played out to
Andrews who laid it off for Alyson Annan to score. Eight minutes later
Andrews again was left unmarked. This time she dragged the ball into the
circle and beat Lawrie with a brilliant drive.
Scotland got a goal back just after half-time. Susan MacDonald went
through on the left, and was fouled. She converted the penalty.
Just when it appeared as through Scotland were fighting back, they
suffered a cruel blow. Lawrie had just made another superb save. The
ball was played forward to Katrina Powell a yard from the line, and she
forced the ball into the goal.
Earlier in the day, Rhona Simpson had put Scotland on the road to
victory in four minutes against Ireland.
After 20 minutes, Pauline Robertson picked up a loose ball deep inside
her own half and after an interpassing move with MacDonald, the opening
was there for Alyson Ramsay to score.
Two goals in two minutes at the start of the second half put a truer
reflection on the game. Robertson, the team captain, scored the third
and MacDonald, who had set up the two opening goals, scored the fourth.
Results:
Scotland 4, Ireland 0; Scotland 1, Australia 3.

MANON Bollegraf and Rennae Stubbs recovered from a disastrous start to
beat former US Open finalists Patty Sendick and Jill Hetherington in
yesterday's semi-final of the Women's World Doubles Cup at
Craiglockhart.
The American-Canadian pairing took the first set 6-0 in just 26
minutes and looked to be heading for a quick victory, but Bollegraf and
Stubbs broke Hetherington in the opening game of the second set and
reeled off five of the next six games to force the first three-set match
of the $188,000 event.
Fendick and Hetherington were left to rue missed chances when they
failed to capitalise on breaks of serve in both the third and seventh
games as the second seeds clinched a 0-6, 6-1, 6-4 victory.
In today's final the second seeds have a chance to avenge a straight
sets defeat in the Paris indoor championships in February when they take
on the favourites Larisa Neiland and Meredith McGrath.
The 29-year-old Latvian doubles specialist and her lively American
partner are seeded four in next week's French Open and survived a close
first set before edging past former champions Zina Garrison-Jackson and
Katrina Adams 7-5, 6-1.
Neiland, who has played with a variety of partners this year,
including Gabriela Sabatini and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, is bidding for
her third World Doubles Cup title. She said: ''At 6-5 up in the first
set I had to serve into the wind which was difficult. At 40-15 we had
two set points then I double-faulted and Meredith misjudged two
overheads so we were almost in a tie-break.
''We got it on our fourth set point, and after we broke Katrina in the
first game of the second set, we really took control.'' Results:
J Lloyd (GB) and T Austin (USA) beat R Emerson (Australia) and J Durie
(GB) 5-7, 6-1, 7-5; J Kriek (South Africa) and V Wade (GB) beat R Taylor
(GB) and W Turnbull (Australia) 6-1, 6-4.

CIGARETTE giants Philip Morris, Formula One's biggest backers,
yesterday fired a warning shot by telling the sport to clean up its act.
A top official from the company, best known for their Marlboro brand,
revealed that they have been reconsidering their 25-year association
with the sport.
The company injects around #100m a year into motorsport worldwide with
many millions going into F1.
Walter Thoma, president of Philip Morris (Europe), hit out at the
sport's governing body, FIA, after a series of setbacks which plunged
the sport into crisis.
He said the company had decided to continue its investment despite the
deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand
Prix last year.
But he added they were dismayed at the allegations of cheating that
hit the sport -- notably involving world champion Michael Schumacher and
his Benetton team.
''Those accusations diminished the sport for the remainder of the
season,'' said Thoma.
''1994 will be remembered as a low point in the history of Formula One
-- a sad and damaging year, one that most of us would like to forget.''
Thoma also was critical of the way Schumacher was reinstated as winner
of this season's opening race in Brazil after he and Scot David
Coulthard, who was second, had been disqualified for fuel
irregularities.
The pair won back their points on appeal to an independent tribunal,
although their respective teams did not get their constructors' points
back.

WITH their chances of getting to the World Bowl reliant on results
from the remaining three weeks' fixtures, the Scottish Claymores will
play a game of win and hope for the rest of the World League season.
That starts tonight at Murrayfield when the Scots host Barcelona
Dragons in their first evening fixture, kicking off at 7pm. The
Claymores, with a record of 1-6, must beat the Spanish and hope that
London's Monarchs do them a favour in beating the 4-3 Rhein Fire, who
are 2-0 for the second half of the season.
The Claymores' head coach, Jim Criner, refused to concede that the
Scots' season was over after last weekend's 30-13 loss to league leaders
Amsterdam Admirals, but he did admit the Claymores were now a ''definite
long shot'' for the World Bowl, which will be held in Amsterdam on the
weekend of June 17-18.
The Claymores have lost two of their most influential players for the
remainder of the season. Quarterback Lee Williamson suffered a
dislocated shoulder against Amsterdam, and has returned to the United
States for treatment at the Houston Oilers, his National Football League
club.
Cornerback Jocelyn Borgella, arguably one of the Claymores' best
defensive players, has also rejoined his NFL team, Detroit Lions, after
a knee injury failed to respond to treatment.
That leaves quarterback Matt Blundin in charge of a battered and
bruised Claymores squad.

FORMER Scottish Open champion Craig Parry, rejuvenated after a
fortnight off, opened up a two-stroke lead after the second round of the
$1.4m Colonial Invitation tournament at Fort Worth, Texas, yesterday.
Australian Parry, the Scottish Open champion, recovered from an early
bogey to card a five-under-par 65 in breezy morning conditions at
Colonial Country Club. He reeled off five birdies in six holes, starting
at the sixth, before completing his round in style with another birdie
at the last.
Parry, who had an eye infection earlier in the week, is at nine-under
131, while American Lennie Clements is second on 133 after a one-under
69. Defending champion Nick Price -- also holder of The Open and US PGA
-- narrowly survived the cut after having shot a 69 for two-over 142.
Leading scores (US unless stated):
131 -- Craig Parry (Australia) 66, 65.
133 -- Lennie Clements 64, 69.
134 -- Jeff Maggert 66, 68.
135 -- Tom Lehman 67, 68.

THERAPY David Lodge Secker &amp; Warburg, #15
LAURENCE Passmore is rich, happily married and overweight. He is 58,
nicknamed Tubby, scripts a successful television sitcom, has a smart
London flat and a big house in Rummidge, the place Lodge's readers call
Birmingham.
Tubby suffers from middle-aged angst, male menopause, or a combination
of the two. He worries about approaching impotence and his self-esteem
has gone. He has been married to Sally for more than 30 years and has a
platonic girlfriend, Amy, who suggests therapy might help.
The trouble stems from a mysterious pain in his right knee. His sense
of anxiety and unease is scarcely placated by his therapists, one of
whom suggests he lists the good things in his life in one column, with
the bad things in another. The first column covers wife, children,
income, car, and holidays. The second column says: ''Feel unhappy most
of the time.''
So with everything both right and wrong, Passmore again takes Amy's
advice and embraces the notion of existential angst. By the time he gets
to Kierkegaard his wife has left and his sitcom is threatened by the
star's departure.
David Lodge can catch the mood of our times. He has developed a way of
looking beyond the individual and his predicament, often concentrating
on the condition and the reasons why such a condition exists. He has a
clear and engaging, readable style, though he always seems to be working
within his self-imposed limitations and seldom stretches beyond these
boundaries.
His previous books have been written in the third person. A therapist
suggested Tubby should begin a journal as the means of combating
depression and it forms the basis of this novel. The journal is
obviously written in the first person which gives Lodge freedom to
excavate new areas of awkward intimacy and personal difficulties, though
the journal format also forces Passmore to explain to himself things he
would have known.
The journal is abandoned in the second part of the novel and replaced
by a series of reported statements from those implicated in, or affected
by Tubby's separation. This exposes a weakness, for the introduction of
other voices simply highlights Tubby's self-obsession and the fact that
everything has been filtered through his voice.
Like most writers, David Lodge has an extensive repertory of subjects
which inspire or annoy him and once again we find he is at his best
teasing Roman Catholicism or contradicting himself about Birmingham.
Yet, even here, there is a feeling that he is doing no more than is
expected and when he settles on a subject for satirical attack it is as
familiar and obvious as British Rail. He also explains a number of
subjects, such as negative equity, which would have inspired more than a
definition in the past, yet is wonderfully accurate on the National
Health Service. Tubby has his knee operation in Rummidge General
Hospital because the BUPA place is full.
The problem is structure rather than narrative. Lodge's great plotting
abilities, his skill in devising a structured framework for strong
characterisation and sharply relevant social observations, have been
abandoned for a solitary voice and a seemingly random series of
recollections and implausibilities.
His zest and energy are occasionally glimpsed, though his ability to
exploit embarrassment in all its features is devastatingly intact, and
Passmore's reunion with the first girlfriend and the resolution it
brings are both convincing and surprisingly moving. But what seemed so
effortless now takes time and what was invisible is all too transparent.

* TV Presenter Viv Lumsden tells ANN DONALD what she reads before
dropping off.
I'M going through a bit of a biography phase. At the moment I'm
reading Judy Garland's Life Story because I'm a very big fan of hers.
It's really a psychological profile -- which is what a biography should
be rather than a straightforward chronological breakdown of what someone
has done in their life. This biography is quite academic, quite studied
in its approach with almost too much detail on the people who mattered
to her and those who let her down. It's really looking back to what must
have been a horrendous childhood and teenage life because Garland had
such awful problems with drink, drugs, and relationships later on. She
was such a casualty of the star system as it was then.
I've always been a bit suspicious of autobiographies because they give
such a slanted view. In fact, the worst book I've ever read was Ginger
Rogers's autobiography. It was shockingly written and she came across as
one of the most self-righteous opinionated, pleased-with-herself
individuals I've ever read about.
One of the best autobiographies you could possibly hope to read is by
Dirk Bogarde who must have written about six phases in his life. He
doesn't actually talk about himself as you see him through the eyes of
what he's talking about. You get to know him just by the nature of his
writing and how he feels about people and what kind of lifestyle he has.
I seem to have got into a real Hollywood mood. I do read other
sensible books when I have the time. I'm really a holiday reader.
Because of the nice weather and because I've got a nice garden to sit
and read in I've been going back and dipping into the 140 books that
I've still got from a few years ago being a judge of the McVities Prize.
I've just re-read Elspeth Barker's Oh Caledonia which is very well
written. To be honest, being a McVities judge two years in a row and
having to read so many books kind of sickened me slightly. I went really
shallow after that!
I wouldn't claim to be a terribly intellectual reader. I like to be
entertained. I like the dimension of reading. I think it's like radio
where you work at your own images, unlike TV where it's laid at your
feet. Reading is a much more engaging way of conjuring up pictures.

LARRY Gilbert rallied from an inconsistent start with four birdies on
the back nine yesterday to take a one-stroke lead on the first day of
the $1.1m Quicksilver Classic golf tournament at Midway, Pennsylvania .
Gilbert, a two-time winner in three years on the Senior PGA Tour, shot
a five-under-par 67 at the soggy Quicksilver Country Club, almost five
strokes under his average in 33 rounds this year.
In second place on 68 were Tommy Aaron, Buddy Allin, and Isao Aoki.
George Archer, Jerry McGee, and J C Snead, who lost a lead and finished
second in last week's Bell Atlantic Classic, shot 69.
It rained part of Wednesday, Thursday and yesterday at Quicksilver, a
former surface coal mine near Pittsburgh. In a late rule change, golfers
were allowed to move balls that rolled into wet fairway spots. Golfers
said the leftover water helpfully shortened putts on the course's
notoriously hilly greens.
The course yielded only one eagle, to Simon Hobday, on the par-5
fourth.

JAMES BOSWELL'S LIFE OF JOHNSON, volume 1
Marshall Waingrow (ed.)
Edinburgh University Press &amp; Yale University Press, #75.
THIS book is the first step in a long journey, of publishing the
entire private papers of James Boswell, who left behind him probably the
biggest archive of anyone who lived in the eighteenth century.
The abridged, so-called, trade edition, intended for the general
reader, is already complete, in 14 volumes. This research edition may
stretch to 30 or more, and can only reach its conclusion long after we
are all dead. It will rank as an outstanding achievement of scholarship,
and all credit is due to the two academic presses involved.
The series kicks off with the first of four volumes, in essence
setting out the history of the composition of Boswell's Life of Johnson,
his most substantial work -- the one which has won him immortality, and
which in many ways provides the model for all modern biography. It is
done by tracing the textual variants between the author's manuscript and
the final printed version.
That general reader, perhaps wondering if 14 volumes are not enough,
may well ask why the task should be thought useful. Boswell, obsessed
with getting his subject right, was after all a tireless corrector and
reviser of his own wording, and may be presumed to have left what he
wished others to find. An architect who finishes a magnificent monument
does not keep the scaffolding up right round it.
There are two answers. First, just because of the complex mechanics of
composition, errors of one kind or another were bound to creep in, some
of which even Boswell failed to notice. An absolutely definitive text
can now be established.
Secondly, as the editor points out, we can view the text as process
rather than product. Since the sources, where available, are given too,
we can see exactly how Boswell dealt with and recast them. For the parts
original to him, we can observe how he tried out various formulations
until he hit on just what he wanted: though often he seems to have gone
back to what he first thought of.
Altogether, as examples of genius at work, these volumes will be
difficult to surpass.

A LIFE OF FORMS Sally Festing Viking, #20.
WE HAVE biographies aplenty of Epstein, Henry Moore, Sutherland,
Nicholson: all the grand old men of modern art. Now, at long last, we
have a welcome and very readable big book on Barbara Hepworth, the first
great woman sculptor.
Before she died, Hepworth discussed her biography with her son-in-law,
Alan Bowness -- later director of the Tate. Twenty years on his
definitive book has still not appeared. Hopefully it is a treat in
store. Sally Festing has found her own way round the problem and is to
be congratulated.
Gripping in its roller-coaster account of Hepworth's life and loves
(she was first married to John Skeaping, whom she left for Ben
Nicholson), it is by no means all a paean of praise; nor is it perfect.
A bit silly and much given to supposition, it is still very welcome, for
it paints a vivid picture in fluent, engaging style, of a woman in a
man's world, determined to succeed.
''Barbara was 31, the only woman among the exhibitors, conspicuous by
her sex and perhaps, in deference to it, promininently placed. Beneath
finely stencilled eyebrows in a pale triangular face, the Haverstock
Venus, as she was known, stared out coolly, beautiful in a Garboesque
way; strong but guarded.
''The mouth is, as ever, firmly set. Whatever uncertainties she may
have felt, the pose implies resolution. It was a face of
self-possession; there are no loose ends. Barbara Hepworth is
forward-looking, complete. The image was truthful without being the
whole truth.''
Sally Festing is not an art historian, but she has done a huge amount
of research, interviewing 70 of Hepworth's stepchildren, assistants,
friends and aquaintances, some now dead. ''Margaret Gardiner of Orkney,
Margaret Mellis. Wilhelmina Barns-Graham was cautious; Terry Frost
wasn't.''
She puts their recollections to good use to flesh out the restrained
and reverential story normally accorded to Hepworth in monographs --
even as recently as last autumn -- which saw, at Liverpool's Tate, the
first retrospective since her death.
Hepworth may have been a single-minded workaholic: moody, difficult to
live with, tyrannical as an employer, ''like a quivering violin string
stretched out to the point of highest tension''. But she was a
world-class artist whose guts and breadth of outlook created a new form:
the abstract hole in modern art.
A sculptor of interior landscapes, ''probably the most compulsive
tunneller in the history of sculpture'', she made mysterious rooms and
chambers, so that ''one's sense of scale collapses and one finds oneself
on the verge of a landscape of the mind, infinitely larger than the form
which encloses it''.
Other carvings, ''as precarious as a stork on one leg'', were inspired
by the radiance and light of Italy, where ''luminescence drops into
cities at dawn, invading their quiet streets, slipping beneath arches,
opening courtyards and piazzas, pouring on to the hats of their pantiled
roofs. One imagines her, dressed like a cross between a Pre-Raphaelite
painter and an archetypal shepherdess, inhabiting museums, pencil in
hand''.
What a relief not to have to wade through academic jargon. Festing
writes easily, juggling evocative descriptions of contemporary art with
historical and personal asides; cutting great swathes through the
twentieth century as she humanises Moore, with his schoolboy sense of
fun, playing shove-halfpenny, baiting goldfish with worms in the garden
pond; Mondrian (conducted to London, contemplating delightedly, from the
windows of the train, the grid made by telegraph poles); or the St Ives
group, with their intense rivalries.
Festing's objective eye allows her to record the good and bad, and to
ask dangerous questions, like, ''Was Moore her lover?'' Family problems
with her four children are included but not dwelt on.
In 1966 Hepworth was made a Dame of the British Empire -- the first
public recognition that a woman artist could excel. ''Barbara wondered
whether to make a tiara from wire and fish line for a second visit to
Buckingham Palace.'' She always broke the rules over the way women
should behave; even the gravestone she had carved for herself came above
the permitted height!
She was ahead of her time: not only with abstraction, but with
site-specific work and much more. She paid the price for her fame, but
in paving the way for today's artists, led the life she wanted. One can
but admire her resolution.

CROMPTON HILL has been laid out for the Tote Silver Bowl at Haydock
and trainer Neil Graham could not have been more pleased with his
preparation.
On his reappearance, he won readily in a smart time from a large
field. In that race he was getting a stone-and-a-half from runner-up
Ihtiram, but last season he came home only two lengths behind the same
rival at levels. He should be able to score again off another light
weight.
Mezaan is the danger, but may prove to have more stamina than the pace
for this fast mile.
Loyelize may start favourite for the Listed race on the strength on
her wins last year, but looks worth opposing on the form of her runs
this season.
Katya could be the value bet. She won over course and distance in
April and ran a creditable second last time out when she found the trip
a furlong too short.
Sanmartino looked ready to score last time out when finishing a close
second at Chester. His breeding is promising for success over middle
distances and he should open his account today in the Eccles Maiden
State.
If Crompton Hill lands the Tote Silver Bowl, it will strengthen the
claims for Ihtiram in the Listed race at Kempton.
Last week he won in his own time, leaving the rest of the field in a
race for second place. He can make it two in a row today and confirmed
the top form of John Dunlop's yard.
Halkopous has had a disappointing jump season and ran a lacklustre
race at Aintree but he put that behind him when staying on fifth to
Midyn Blue at York recently.
With a 4lb pull and a return to two miles, Halkopous looks set for a
return to winning ways in Doncaster's Harewood Rated Stakes.
Don Corleone, fourth to Celtic Swing in the Racing Post trophy,
reappears in the Sunday Market Stakes. He ran below his best that day,
but even on that form he should be too quick for these inexperienced
rivals.

MICHAEL Roberts returned to winning ways in Britain yesterday,
insisting that he had no regrets about missing the first two months of
the turf season to ride in Japan.
The 1992 champion struck aboard Red Bustaan at Haydock Park after
missing out at Goodwood on Thursday -- his first day in action in this

South African-born Roberts, who rode 21 winners in Japan, said: ''I'm

JOHN KEATS: A LIFE. Stephen Coote. Hodder and Stoughton, #18 (pp 356)
THERE is a tale told about a sergeant ordering the soldiers at his
mercy to behave at a talk to be given on Keats. ''You're an ignorant
lot,'' sneered the sergeant, ''and I bet not one of you knows what a
Keat is.'' We should not sneer at that sergeant, as the subject of Keats
has often caused confusion.
The popular image of the poet as a fragile creature incapable of
surviving for long in a cruelly critical world was largely created by
the suicide of Thomas Chatterton and the life and legend of Keats -- who
dedicated Endymion (1818), that thing of joy and beauty, to the memory
of Chatterton.
Keats composed his finest poems in a fury of creativity that lasted
for the last three years of his life. In 1818 he looked forward to being
remembered ''among the English poets after my death'' but admirers
thought he really looked forward to ''easeful Death'' as an escape from
a psychologically tortured existence. After Keats died, of consumption
in Rome in 1821, Shelley's elegy Adonais eulogised a man who found in
death the peaced denied him in life: ''And that unrest which men miscall
delight/Can touch him not and torture not again.'' Keats could rest in
peace.
On Keats's tombstone in the Protestant Cemetery in Rome is an
inscription supplied by the poet himself: ''Here lies one whose name was
writ in water.'' Shelley was impressed by the serenity of the cemetery.
''It might make one in love with death,'' wrote Shelley, whose ashes
were placed in the same cemetery after he had been found drowned with a
Keats collection in his pocket, ''to think that one should be buried in
so sweet a place.'' Death, Shelley suggested, was a romantic affair
compared to the reality of poetic life.
According to Shelley and Byron, Keats was killed off by criticism. The
author of Endymion was, in 1818, ridiculed as ''tiresome and absurd'' in
the Tory Quarterly Review; condemned as ''a young Cockney rhymester'' of
''drivelling idiocy'' in the Tory Blackwood's Magazine. Hostile critics
mocked the supposedly inferior social status of Keats, resented him as a
man who confronted the collective power of the establishment with the
individual power of his imagination.
In his preface to Adonais Shelley stated: ''The savage criticism on
his Endymion . . . produced the most violent effect on his susceptible
mind; the agitation thus originated ended in a rupture of a blood vessel
in the lungs; a rapid consumption ensued.'' In Don Juan, Byron came to a
somewhat similar conclusion: '''Tis strange the mind, that very fiery
particle/Should let itself be snuffed out by an article.''
However, Keats did not die a creative death after the attacks of 1818.
He published his most memorable collection in 1820 -- Lamia, Isabella,
The Eve of St Agnes, and Other Poems. This volume included, in addition
to the title pieces, the great Odes, (to a Nightingale, on a Grecian
Urn, to Psyche, on Melancholy) and established Keats as a poet who had
finally solved the formal problems that had bothered him before. Even
antagonistic critics had to admit they had been wrong in writing off a
man who had the measure of his times.
The earliest biographical sketch of Keats appeared in Leigh Hunt's
Lord Byron and Some of His Contemporaries (1828). A close friend of
Keats, Hunt should have known better than to write: ''Mr Keats's origin
was of the humblest description.'' In fact Keats's origin was far from
humble as his father helped run the family business and stables attached
to the Swan and Hoop Inn in London. Still, the myth -- of the poor boy
who remained a poor soul -- persisted and Keats became the darling of
Victorians who drooled over his rich verse as they lamented the plight
of a poor sacrificial victim.
Modern biographers -- Robert Gittings in 1968, Walter Jackson Bate in
1979 -- tried to tell the truth about a poet who thought truth
synonymous with beauty. Under the influence of Gittings and Bate,
Stephen Coote finds that the truth about Keats is brutal as well as
beautiful. Coote describes the poet dying, not from the unkind cuts of
critics, but from violent haemorrhages and associated agonies so severe
that friends were certain Keats would end his life in suicide.
Keats was a tougher character than those who criticised him. As a
schoolboy he was a battler, not only outboxing other pupils but once
striking a teacher who had boxed his brother's ears. As a medical
student he witnessed the horrors of the operating theatre. He championed
Leigh Hunt though Hunt had been imprisoned as an enemy of the
establishment. He weathered a stormy relationship with his beloved Fanny
Brawns.
The proof of Keats's strength is in his poetry. In 1817 he formulated
the theory of ''negative capability'' to explain his approach to poetry.
His negative capability was a positive quality of remaining open to
experience, forever exercising the imagination. Keats produced a new
kind of poetry -- seemingly spontaneous but cunningly constructed by a
master technician -- so sensuous it was interpreted as an indecent
threat to a literary establishment conditioned by the restraints of
English as perfected in the ding-dong verse of Pope. Even Byron was
initially inimical to Keats, calling his work ''a sort of mental
masturbation''.
Coote defends Keats as a politically liberal and poetically innovative
force strong enough to survive a ''united Tory attack on (his) manhood,
morals and politics'', but cursed by a wretched constitution. This is a
sympathetic, stimulating account of one whose name was writ in water and
whose fame is securely preserved in print.

WHATEVER else he does in his career, Les Mottram knows that he will
have to live with the mistake that has become a part of Scottish
football folklore, the day at Firhill when he didn't give a goal after
the ball went into the net and back out again.
It has become far more notorious a miss than anything Ally McCoist,
Mark Hateley, et al have achieved in careers spent missing more than a
few goals. Yet the only Scots referee who was considered good enough for
the World Cup in the US last year has learned to shrug his shoulders and
accept the inevitable.
It says a great deal for his resilience that this one-time Airdrie
player has taken all the slings and arrows that followed his error three
years ago and gone on to become the country's No.1 ref.
It is perhaps no great surprise that Mottram, who will have the job of
keeping the peace and trying to ensure Scotland's showpiece cup final
today will be worthy of the occasion, has been able to come out from
behind the wagons after his faux pax. Anybody who takes on the task of
the referee in the professional game knows that a hard skin has to be
grown, cultivated and regularly renewed if he has to have any chance of
surviving in the ultimate sporting exercise for masochists.
Mottram has an interesting answer to that oft-asked question about
refs. Why do it when all you get is stick? He points out that nobody
ever goes into the business thinking that he will get to the
high-profile status that brings the raspberries, the taunts, and the
abuse which is life at the top for the men in the middle.
Mottram, who is head of the technical department at Calderhead High
School, Shotts, played football for Airdrie Academy before he was asked
to sign for Airdrie, where his professional career began and ended.
Mottram (''I was a skilful defender who played keepy-uppy with
players'') spent two years at Broomfield before being given a free
transfer and never quite made it to a first-team place.
He was reinstated to Junior level where, during the next decade, he
played for a whole collection of teams, including Shotts Bon Accord,
Thornliewood, Armadale, Bathgate, and Forth. It was after his playing
days ended that he meandered into refereeing, via schools football. That
came after he had trained as a design draughtsman at Honeywell but
hankered after the teaching profession and eventually started in
Caldervale School in Airdrie before moving to his current post 13 years
ago.
''When I started taking school teams I found that half the time I had
to referee them as well and I thought I might as well take the exam and
see what happened. It has just gone from there. At the end of the day we
all love football and this is a way of being involved.''
He has a quiet pride in reaching the top as a middleman, particularly
representing his country in the USA last summer. At 44, he has six years
left to referee in Scotland but comes off the FIFA list in December,
1996. ''I will have to think about what to do after that. You get used
to the foreign travel and the exciting appointments, but if I feel fit
enough and enthusiastic enough I will probably still go on. I intend to
take it as it comes.''
Mottram will not be able to follow his normal Saturday routine --
breakfast, a mid-morning coffee and a general relaxation before kick-off
time. ''I can't do that this week, because there is a pre-final lunch at
a hotel in Glasgow with the supervisors, which has become the cup-final
routine. It means that I will have to sit and pick at a lunch that I
don't really want to eat, but I understand why it is done. They are
trying to make it an occasion for everyone.''
The appointment to the final, his first, means a great deal to the
articulate Mottram as he sees it as a recognition from his own country
and, in any case, it is the peak appointment for any referee in
Scotland.
He will go into each dressing room before the game this afternoon,
check their studs and have a wee bit banter with them. ''There will be
no particular instructions. They know me, I know them. I won't be
pontificating. They should know the laws of the game and they know how I
referee. It will be a case of wishing them good luck and getting on with
it.''
He belongs to the school of thought that believes communication
between referee and players is paramount. ''As long as the players
accept that you will have a wee word with them occasionally, it will be
fine, but if they ignore you then you have to act.
''I hope Peter Grant is playing for a start. He is one you can talk to
in the middle of the park, and some of the Airdrie players are quite
sociable, shall I say.
''Professionals are professionals. They have a job to do and I suppose
it depends if it is their nature to talk to you. I think if we can get
things sorted out with a few words it can prevent disciplinary action
later.''
Mottram, who knows that the first question he will be asked when he
appears on a sports panels will be about that goal scored by Dundee
United which he didn't see. ''I have got used to that now but all I can
say is that it was a mistake, but it was an honest one.
''If I could go back now and give Dundee United a goal I would but I
have to hold my hands up. My conscience is clear. I didn't cheat anyone
or do anything dishonest. If you come away from a game knowing that you
did everything honestly you can go back on to the football field. Baresi
didn't become a bad player by missing a penalty in the World Cup
final.''
The fact that he was once a player for Airdrie may worry some folk
concerned about neutrality in the final, but Mottram dismisses those
notions. ''I have refereed Airdrie many times and there is no chance of
any bias on my part. Apart from the fact that it was a long time ago
when I was with them, I have a simple philosophy about our job. Referees
don't think, they react, and in that context colours mean nothing.''
Mottram will receive #300 for his big-day appearance, almost #200 more
than the League pay for the weekly grind, but money could never be a
motivating factor for this rare group of men.
He has no great ambitions. ''I never really had any to begin with,
although I did want to become Class 1. Once that was achieved I was
quite happy. In this business you never know what is coming next so it
is best not to be ambitious. Saturday could be my last game. It has
happened to players and referees before me.''
Calderhead High School has been a home from home for the Mottrams. His
wife, Joy, is a PE teacher there, daughter Sarah has just left to start
Edinburgh University, and son Christopher is a pupil there.
All of them will be there to see dad in action at Hampden, but if
there was any danger of Les being overcome by self-esteem as he
approaches his biggest moment his mother, as mums will, removed it
efficiently.
''I told her about me and the final and asked if she would like to be
there. She said 'yes', but a few days later she called me back to say
she couldn't. 'I forgot,' she said, 'it is the Women's Guild trip to
Aberdeen.' ''

All decent estate agents want to see a minimum standard of entry into
the profession.
ESTATE agents have an image problem. Like MPs and journalists, they do
not rank highly in the public's esteem, yet their job is an important
one. For most of us our home is by far our biggest asset and when we are
buying or selling we need to do so at the best prices we can get.
In a bid to improve the standards of the UK's estate agents, and to
weed out the cowboys, the National Association of Estate Agents is
calling on the Government to introduce legislation which would set up a
licensing system. Such regulation would encourage greater
professionalism, promote good practice and training, and force any
fraudulent practitioners out of business, believes the NAEA.
At its AGM at the Glasgow Hilton this weekend, it can take some
satisfaction from the progress made so far. Membership has more than
doubled in the last few years, from under 4000 in the eighties to almost
10,000 currently. Anyone wishing to join now has to prove they are
worthy, and an increasing number of members are taking part in formal
education courses.
But the new president, May Storrie of Hamilton-based estate agency
George Storrie, wants to see even more strides made during the next 12
months of her term of office.
Her key aim is to achieve Government regulation of estate agency.
''I'm realistic enough to see that we are unlikely to achieve this by
next year. But we have planned a four-year programme which will keep the
pressure on Government to introduce the kind of regulations which would
ensure higher professional practices in estate agency.''
She believes that the public is behind the NAEA and is puzzled as to
why the Government does not act to improve the industry by introducing a
licensing system. She points to a recent MORI survey in which almost 90%
of those polled said that if they were going to buy or sell property it
was important the estate agency should belong to a recognised
professional body.
Section 22 of the Estate Agents Act calls for minimum levels of
competence in the field of selling houses. ''All decent estate agents
want to see a minimum standard of entry into the profession,'' she says.
''But so far the Government has refused to enact section 22. The Office
of Fair Trading says that to do so would be to create a closed shop, but
our argument is that a properly regulated profession with its own
standards and disciplinary procedures would be no more a closed shop
than that of other professions.''
As part of its bid to improve its own standards, the NAEA now insists
anyone applying for membership should undergo an entry test. The aim is
to demonstrate long-term commitment to the business and to prove
knowledge and experience on key aspects of the buying and selling of
homes.
''The only way we can improve our standards is by putting our staff
through exams and by ensuring that they are getting a good training,''
says May Storrie.
The NAEA is deeply involved in the vocational training of its members
and strongly supports external courses set up under SCOTVEC and, south
of the Border, the NVQ system. But the new president would like to see
stronger Government backing for these attempts to raise standards.
''We are encouraging our members and their staff to take part in
education courses -- but to some extent we are undermined by the fact
that it is not compulsory to be qualified in order to open up shop as an
estate agent. A lot of people want to come into this industry, but we
need an incentive which recognises the hard work put in by those who get
involved in the training courses,'' she says.
Training courses include property selling, preparing a property for
sale, negotiating the sale, securing sales, health and safety,
recruitment and selection of personnel, and management of information.
They are designed to take account of the different legal systems and
selling practices north and south of the Border.
The association would like to build public confidence to the point
where buyers and sellers seek the security of an NAEA member in much the
same way as most people prefer to book their holidays through
ABTA-registered travel agents.
May Storrie believes that it all comes back to the need for
legislation to restrict estate agency practice to those who are
qualified. ''What we want is a system where we are left to get on with
our job of selling properties -- but can be struck off if we are guilty
of malpractice. Such a system would be fair to buyers, sellers and
estate agents. Until the Government introduces a licensing system, I
would urge buyers and sellers to use only members of the NAEA, which is
raising the standards of estate agency.''
She says the less-scrupulous agents tend to avoid membership of the
association. ''We have our own disciplinary system. Members can be fined
or even expelled from the NAEA. Expulsion is a tough sanction and
members facing disciplinary hearings will usually fight hard to stay in
membership. This shows an encouraging increase in the regard for the
association and its standards.''

WITHOUT having raced for eight months, and despite the fact that she
last contested the event in 1983, Yvonne Murray revealed yesterday that
she has been offered the single place at 5000 metres in Britain's team
for the Europa Cup final next month in Lille.
That kind of advance endorsement is afforded by the UK athletics
establishment to very few -- to Coe and Ovett at their peak, to Christie
and Jackson, or Gunnell.
Yet immediately before last year's Commonwealth 10,000m gold, Murray
was dismissed, by a publication in her home city, as ''unlikely to
fulfil her potential.'' This was just a few weeks after she had run the
second fastest 2000m ever -- in Edinburgh.
Being a prodigy accorded little honour in her own backyard is
depressingly familiar, but the verdict fell on deaf ears and unseeing
eyes. For Murray no longer reads newspapers -- or at least nothing that
relates to her. ''I've been wound up too often by negative comment,''
she said on the eve of her seasonal debut today at Portsmouth, in the
BUPA International 5000m road race.
She saw enough this week however to get herself wound up regarding her
sport. Murray is incensed that the International Amateur Athletic
Federation, the world governing body, has just reduced the minimum
sentence for major doping offences from four years to two.
''It's ridiculous, really disappointing,'' she said, then, giving vent
to a very rare expletive, added vehemently: ''It should be bloody life
for these offences. The cheats are making a mockery of the sport. The
level of testing is going to have to be stepped up.''
If that means more intrusion in her life, she is prepared to accept
it. Murray had just put her feet up in the Lanarkshire home she shares
with fiance Tom Mooney, having demolished a curry after training
recently. ''It was 9.10pm when the doorbell went,'' said Yvonne. ''It
was the IAAF dope-testing team.
''I don't mind. Unfortunately, it has to be done, but it was my third
out-of-season test this winter by the IAAF. Including British tests,
I've had one, on average, every three weeks since January. In 16 years
as an athlete I've never been tested so often. I think all negative
results should be publicised.''
Murray revealed she has accepted the Europa Cup 5000m place, which
means missing the Scottish Championships the same weekend, June 23 and
24.
Last year, sticking her toe in the water at 10,000m, Murray pulled out
Commonwealth gold. But now the dabbling has stopped, and the 25-lap race
is her main event, her goal this summer at the World Championships in
Gothenburg. Today at Portsmouth she is in at the deep end, facing the
Ethiopian Derartu Tulu, the Olympic 10,000m and world cross-country
champion, who will also be a principal rival in Sweden. Today's field
also includes City of Glasgow's Vikki McPherson, the Commonwealth team
captain.
''I don't look on this as a major test because Tulu is running,''
insists Murray. ''The important one is Gothenburg -- this is just a
guide to see how the winter has gone. It's eight months since I raced,
so I'm excited, but I am more relaxed. In the past there was so much
pressure that excitement turned to fear.''
Despite successes including European titles indoor and out, a world
indoor crown, and Olympic bronze, there are races she would rather
forget, most notably the advent of the Chinese at the last World
Championships, where she shared the lead until 600m to go, then
disappeared back through the field, finishing ninth after the Chinese
swept past.
''I've analysed these races to death, and you can't change what has
happened. The Chinese element of surprise floored me. But this year I
will be prepared, able to look at it logically, rather than
emotionally.''
Inevitably this year, the burden of expectation on Murray will again
be heavy, and it will intensify if Liz McColgan fails in her stated
ambition of lining up alongside her in Sweden.
''I really hope Liz makes it,'' said Yvonne. ''Both of us have done
many of our best times running against each other.''
It is exactly two years this week since they last raced one another,
at Aberdeen, and there was a heated exchange afterwards, McColgan upset
over a too-close encounter. You can take it there will be no more
room-sharing.
''We've produced phenomenal times together. Every time I meet Liz, I
know it's going to be a battle -- there's so much at stake, pride-wise.
Inevitably, in such circumstances, we are not going to meet socially,
though I was a guest at her wedding. But you are hardly going to go out
for dinner with a rival. It's not the thing to do. There is a great
affection, but it is one born of mutual respect.''

AMONG the many other threats to personal financial security are the
changes which have just been made by the Government to Incapacity
Benefit. These have made it more difficult for people who are forced to
leave work through ill-health to claim the benefits they need.
Incapacity Benefit now operates on a three-tier system. Low rate
short-term benefit is for anyone who has to leave work for up to 28
weeks. High rate short-term benefit is available to anyone who will be
unable to work for 29 to 52 weeks.
High rate long-term benefit can be given only to those who will not be
able to earn a living for more than a year. Qualifying for the new
higher rate benefits is much harder than for those they replace.
''Claimants will need to satisfy stringent qualifying conditions by
medical assessment,'' said Graham Grant, an IFA in Dunblane. ''This will
measure the ability of a claimant to perform any occupation.''
High and long-term Incapacity Benefits -- and the adult dependant
benefit which sometimes goes with them -- have become taxable. An Adult
Dependants Allowance will only be payable if the person is over pension
age or has dependant children.
Benefit levels now mean that if the claimant is single the maximum
amount he or she can receive is #3060 a year. The Government has done
this to cut costs in the DSS budget. Whatever the reasons, the changes
mean the individual's best defence against long-term absence from work
through illness is to take out permanent health insurance (PHI).
''The last time the Government told people to look after themselves
they shouted it from the rooftops and thousands bought personal
pensions,'' said Mr Grant. ''When things started to go wrong the
Government took no responsibility for its actions and told the pension
industry to sort itself out. The pension industry was regulated by the
Financial Services Act, and they and the Government are still arguing
about it.''
This time there is no shouting from the rooftops. The Government is
not advising people to take out PHI cover. The PHI industry does not
come under any form of regulation, so who protects the customer if
things go wrong? Arranging cover is not quick and easy. The client needs
to be able to consider carefully all the options open and choose that
which best suits his or her needs.
''When the only thing you can be sure of is that the Government won't
pay your bills if you are ill for any length of time, your best
alternative is to take out PHI cover,'' said Mr Grant. ''You can consult
with your bank, building society or IFA who will be able to assess your
needs and make sure you get the cover which is right for you.''

Unless a woman starts planning for retirement earlier than her male
colleagues, she is inevitably going to end life less well-off
THERE is no difference between women and men as far as the need to
plan their financial futures is concerned. But women can face a range of
specific problems not encountered by men in arranging their pensions.
The Government's decision to bring the retirement ages for men and
women into line made a financial impact only on women as far as planning
their pensions was concerned. More women than men take career breaks and
will have a serious impact on their future financial well-being.
Changes in divorce laws and the lessening of state pension benefits
have also had their effect, and the result is that women now need to
seek advice on planning their futures much earlier than they might have
thought.
''The crunch invariably comes at the end of the marriage, either
through divorce or widowhood,'' said Mark Morpurgo of Personal and
Corporate Solutions in Glasgow, who is author of Women and Pensions -- a
Guide to Financial Independence. ''The average woman takes seven years
of career breaks in her life. Unless she starts planning for retirement
earlier than her male colleagues, she is inevitably going to end life
less well-off in retirement.''
Already there are four women to every man claiming income support in
retirement. This situation is likely to get worse as the effects of
raising the retirement age for women work their way through. The
decision to raise the retirement age to 65 will adversely affect all
women who are under 45 at the moment. The change will save the
Government an estimated #5000m a year, and has been solely at the
expense of women.
Women in their thirties who still want to retire at 60 will have to
invest substantially more than they do now to make up for the loss of
five years of state benefits. This amounts to more than #15,000 for each
woman.
Michael Portillo, the Secretary of State for Employment, has said that
by the next century the state pension will be worth ''a nugatory
amount''. In other words, don't rely on the state to support your
retirement.
''Elderly women, particularly those who are widows, are among the
poorest members of our society,'' said Mr Morpurgo. ''While an
independent financial adviser may be able to do little for those who
have already retired and are reliant solely on the state, they can do an
enormous amount to help women who are still working or taking a career
break.''
For women who rely on their husband's pension plans, the IFA can
explain all the possible benefits and shortcomings. ''An unfortunate
reality of modern life is that more than one in three marriages end in
divorce,'' said Mr Morpurgo. ''At the point of divorce the most valuable
assets the couple have are usually the matrimonial home and pension
schemes. Too often the divorcing wife gets the home but no future income
for her retirement, and the man has no home but keeps his pension.''
Divorced women, therefore, suffer because they lose widows' pension
benefits and life assurance benefits under their husbands' pension
schemes. To avoid this financially disastrous eventuality, IFAs can help
married couples develop a pension plan which will be of benefit to both
parties should the marriage break up.
The bottom line is that women shound not rely on their husbands or on
the state to provide for them in retirement. To be financially stable
and secure, women should take control of their own pension arrangements,
although these can be particularly complex.
''The right product for a woman in her forties whose children have
grown up, and who has a secure job which she intends to stay in, might
be disastrously wrong for a woman taking a career break to bring up
children,'' said Mr Morpurgo. ''An ideal investment for someone who is
self-employed would be totally inappropriate for those who are not
earning.
''Whether women are employed, self-employed, taking a career break,
married or single, they need the professional advice of an independent
financial adviser now as never before.''
Unless a woman starts planning for retirement earlier than her male
colleagues, she is inevitably going to end life less well-off

CLOUDS of sunlit canvas or gaunt reefed spars in the Roaring Forties
-- tall ships evoke in the most lubberly of landsmen nostalgia for the
days of sail. The lofty square-rigged ships that ran down to Chile for
nitrates, the racing clippers of the tea trade fetching home from China,
are now history -- the silent power of sail, a heroic chapter in the
combat between man and nature, long gone.
But this summer the best of the last will hove in to Leith, 100
sailing ships ranging from mighty full-rigged vessels and graceful
topsail schooners, stout barques and brigs through to busy ketches and
cutters, modest sloops and yawls. It will be the biggest spread of sail
that has ever moved across the waters of the River Forth.
The Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Races have attracted 100 sailing ships to
the Port of Leith for the biggest single draw in Scotland's calendar of
outdoor events -- and that includes all football and rugby matches in
the year combined.
It is expected that more than one million people will make their way
through the dock gates during the period July 15 to 18 for a quayside
view of the world's largest sailing ship, the 407ft Russian-owned Sedov,
and the entire range of hulls and rigs moored side by side, right down
to the smallest entrant in the race, the tiny German Peter von Danzig --
seven or eight feet of bowsprit included in its 41ft. Time to think of
blue lagoons and slashing winds, salt horse and snow-white decks, and
wish that one had, after all, run away to sea.
The pungent aroma of Stockholm tar and more than a whiff of adventure
will accompany the ships and the almost 3000 young people who will make
up the crews -- schoolboys and girls, students and office workers,
factory hands and farmers drawn from all over Britain, Poland, Germany,
the Netherlands, Russia, Portugal, Denmark, Belgium, Ireland, Sweden,
Spain, and Estonia -- all the world on its way to Leith. The rules lay
down that at least 50% of every crew is made up of young people aged
16-24.
Bus tours, parties, receptions, dinners, and entertainments with no
apparent limit are being prepared for the young crews and the full-time
officers and afterguard of the ships -- the first-voyagers fusing
together on board each vessel as an effective team, anxious to be off on
the first leg of the race, Bremerhaven bound, 440 miles to dry land.
From that North Sea port, where the ships will regroup and go on show
between July 23-26, there will be what the race organisers call ''a
cruise in company'' up to Frederikshaven in the Baltic. Leaving there on
August 3, it will be back to racing rig, teamwork essential if a ship is
to win its class and score over rivals in the many friendly contests
that inevitably develop, good-natured competition building as the young
crews settle in and ''adopt'' their ships.
Destination on the second racing leg is Amsterdam, another 440 miles
of sailing as close to the wind as the ships' masters think prudent, the
halyards as hard up as the muscles of the crews and their new-won
expertise will permit. In that port they will find themselves part of an
annual jamboree, ''Sail Amsterdam'', in which 1000 ships celebrate the
delights of seaborne, wind-driven trade.
That marks the end of the racing but not the finale of the event for,
on August 14, the ships will put to sea from Amsterdam for another
''cruise in company'' -- fetching into Zeebrugge between August 16-20.
There sails will be reefed, kitbags packed, addresses exchanged, and
farewells made -- the experience of a lifetime and a new outlook on the
future.
The two British top-sail schooners, Sir Winston Churchill and the
closer-to-home Malcolm Miller, are being crewed by young people drawn
solely from Edinburgh and Lothian -- the boys doing their bit aboard the
Sir Winston Churchill, which they will join in Teesside, the girls,
going aboard in Aberdeen, favoured to win aboard the Malcolm Miller.
Tall Ships' project director John Ling explains: ''Experience shows
that while the boys have great get-up-and-go as individuals it is the
girls who take their time to work out the best way to tackle a job and
then get on with it as a team. The smart money is on them to win the
race within a race that will undoubtedly develop between the two
ships.''
Both crews -- 78 young people in all -- are being sponsored by Lothian
and Edinburgh Enterprise Ltd and others under the banner ''Tall Ships'
Challenge''. LEEL's Cathy Malone is looking for great things. ''We are
very involved in training young people and this is the ultimate training
experience. There are tremendous opportunities for personal development,
building confidence, and learning teamwork -- in fact, changing people's
lives in a short period of time.''
Each young person has to raise #100 towards the cost of their trip.
''We feel that is important and makes for more commitment,'' says Cathy
Malone, who helped to vet the 400 who applied for berths. ''We wanted to
give the opportunity to people to whom it would make a difference, whom
we felt would gain something: not necessarily the same thing, but
something. It was an event and an opportunity on our doorstep too good
to be missed.''
Claire Nelson, 16, is training as a nursery nurse, has only been at
sea before on a ferry running from Portsmouth to Zeebrugge, and hopes to
be able to use her initiative and learn to work as a team while on board
her topsail schooner. ''Hopefully I will enjoy the experience,'' she
says.
Tim Aikman, 20, wants to train as a child-care worker for children
with special needs but is presently working as a self-employed gardener.
''I am looking to build better leadership and communication skills, work
as a member of a team, and make friends,'' he says. Tim, who has never
sailed before, is making up for lost time. After the Tall Ships' Races
he is shipping aboard the 138ft training ship Astrid, Barbados bound.
Gillian Thomson, 24, works in insurance and enjoys it -- ''quite a
challenge''. She too has never sailed before and believes it will be
''the experience of a lifetime''. She is, she says, looking forward to
working with others.
Derran Beer, 23, says he is the physical, outdoor type. Two years
unemployed, he is looking for a sense of enjoyment from his Tall Ships
Challenge. ''I know how to conduct myself -- I'm looking for
adventure,'' he says.
Both the Sir Winston Churchill and the Malcolm Miller, sister ships,
will be carrying a great deal of enthusiasm and expectation in their
powerful hulls. But what of the other vessels taking part? With a
trainee crew of 164, officers and after-guard numbering 68, and a length
of 407ft, the Russian square-rigged ship Sedov is the world's largest
sailing vessel.
Almost three times the length of the Sir Winston Churchill and her
sister ship, she will tower above every other vessel in the Port of
Leith, dwarf all comers as the tall ships parade in a gaggle --
mother-duck-and-duckling style with one huge square-rigger leading a
brood of smaller ships -- up the river to a royal review before being
led from the Forth at the start of the race by the Cunard flagship QE2.
Another eye-catcher will be the square-rigged Sagres from Portugal,
large red crosses on her sails, one of four sister ships built by the
Hamburg yard of Blohm and Voss prior to the Second World War. Also in
port will be the magnificent Gladan from Sweden, a beautiful example of
fore-and-aft schooner rig. Built in Stockholm in 1947 as a training ship
for the Swedish Royal Navy, she is a worthy representative of that
country's fleet of sailing ships.
A very tall ship is the Kruzenshtern, also Russian, which carries 150
trainees and measures 377ft -- almost, but not quite, as big as the
Sedov. The Kruzenshtern, one of the most magnificent sailing ships in
the world, began life as the Padua, built in Hamburg in 1926 for the
famous Laeitz Flying ''P'' Line, so called because all their vessels,
many of them engaged in the Chilean nitrate trade, were named with a
capital ''P'' -- from the mighty Preussen to the modest Puck. Taken over
by the Soviet Union in 1946 and rebuilt as a school ship to train
merchant sailors, the Kruzenshtern is named for a famous Russian
explorer.
Britain has a creditable list of entrants for the Tall Ships' Races --
a quarter of the fleet so far. Leith's only entry is the Jean de la
Lune, a French-built tunny fisher from the Azores recently converted to
square rig by her owner, John Reid. The 106ft ship is currently going
about her usual business of taking paying passengers on cruises off
Scotland's west coast but will be back in good time to take pride of
place at the head of the convoy of tall ships when it sails past for
review before the Princess Royal. John Reid says he is still seeking a
few volunteer crew for the Tall Ships' Races -- a hearts-of-oak
invitation to adventure.
For those visitors to the Tall Ships event at Leith who have no plan
to stow away and live out a dream there are plenty of other
entertainments -- one of them a massive water-borne firework display for
the grand finale of the ships' visit to the port, Monday, July 17, very
handily hitting to the very day the 300th anniversary of the Bank of
Scotland which is paying for the big bang.
Freefall parachuting, military bands, entertainers, open-air eating,
and all the fun of a cosmopolitan jamboree will be laid on in, around,
and over the flag-decked fleet. But it is the tall ships themselves, the
big boys and the tiddlers, that will take the eye, hold the attention
and, regardless of racing success, win the day.
THE THROUGHBRED OF THE TEA TRADE
ROBERT BURNS'S witch Nannie entranced Tam o' Shanter with her wild
abandon, short shift, and fleetness of foot. The Dumbarton-built clipper
ship named after the young wanton of Tam's drouthy dream inherited those
very values and, in turn, won the hearts of generations of seafarers.
Today, copper sheathed and fully rigged, she lies in a tailor-made dry
dock at Greenwich, the most famous clipper ship in the world --
figurehead of the Tall Ships' Races and a legend from the days of sail.
The Cutty Sark's fame came about, in part, through the speed of her
passages in the tea trade from China, but above all, among sailors, for
her ability to be driven harder than any other ship of her time. With
all her 29 sails set -- an area of 32,000 sq ft, the equivalent of
three-quarters of an acre -- the Cutty Sark could make 1000 miles in
three days with no great strain. Her huge expanse of canvas produced
3000 horsepower when the ship was driven hard at 17 knots.
The composite clipper, which also saw service in the Australian wool
trade, broke the firm that built her. Scott and Linton of Dumbarton put
their all into Cutty Sark, found the contract price of #17 a ton just
too tight and went bust. She was launched from their yard in November
1869 but the final fitting out was completed by William Denny and
Brothers.
Today, though out of her element, her decks the play-place of
tourists, Cutty Sark is by no means stranded on a lee shore: #2m is to
be spent in the next decade to save her from decay and make her worthy
of an A1 listing at Lloyd's.
Oddly, given Cutty Sark's Scottish origins, little interest has been
shown north of the Border in the Maritime Trust's appeal for funds to
preserve the vessel. Just one Scottish charity has responded, the
Robertson Trust in Glasgow sending a cheque for #15,000 -- just #1150
short of what the vessel cost to build 126 years ago.
The famous tea clipper, now a museum open to the public and a major
tourist attraction, is recognised as the mercantile equivalent of
Nelson's Victory. Mariners manque stand by her wheel and dream of record
passage from Woosung to the London River, winning best price for being
first with the new season's tea. On a broader reach the spirit of Cutty
Sark lives on -- the toast of something stronger than tea of lips
worldwide.
A LANDLUBBER'S GUIDE TO SAIL
NEVER sailed before the mast or run your Easton down, lived on duff
and salt horse, or served a trick at the wheel in the Roaring Forties?
Never mind, below is The Herald's guide to cheating your way as an old
salt -- just don't sign as crew on board a tallship, that's all.
* POOPED -- not what dog owners might think. It is what happens to a
ship when she takes a heavy sea on to her afterdeck.
* SCANTLINGS -- this has nothing to do with short commons, tiny
portions at mealtimes, or weevily biscuit. Scantlings are to be found
underneath ships -- just hope you never see them.
* BAGGYWRINKLE -- not the way you look in the mirror on the morning
after a run ashore but all that fluffy stuff made from old rope which
hangs in the rigging to prevent chaffing.
* SCUPPERS -- that part of the vessel in which the mate will throw you
if you make a slippery hitch: thus ''I'm scuppered''.
* SLIPPERY HITCH -- a knot that doesn't hold, a shabbily executed task
that will lead you, faster than you can pull on your seaboots, to the
scuppers.
* STUNSAILS AND SPANKERS -- not acts of violence of a peculiarly
nautical nature but, simply, sails.
* CATHEAD -- not something which consumes a fish tail but the manner
in which the ship's anchor is hoist up to the bow or put on the
foredeck.
* SHEETS -- do not go with pillow-cases on board a sailing ship but
are used instead to regulate the tension of a sail. Landlubbers will
call them ropes.
* EIGHT BELLS -- must not be confused with something that you knock
out of someone you don't like. What it means is 4am, or 8am, or midday,
or four in the afternoon, or eight in the evening, or midnight -- you
rings your bell and you takes your choice.
* LUBBER -- an unhandy, cack-handed fellow not welcome on board a
ship. Someone quite unlike yourself.

The key to eliminating money worries in later life is getting sound
independent financial advice before old age sets in. Joan Grady and Sean
Francis listen to words of wisdom from those who know.
WHEN did you last sit down and review your life assurances and
savings? You might think you are prepared for all eventualities, but
staying financially secure throughout your life may be more difficult
than you thought.
Today three independent financial advisers -- John MacPhail, Graham
Grant and Mark Morpurgo -- give advice on three aspects of financial
security. In addition, all the firms listed below have agreed to give
Herald readers a free financial check-up.
Financial security depends on many factors -- feeling safe in your
job, having savings to fall back on, making adequate retirement
provision and providing yourself with financial protection in the event
of ill-health. If you're not prepared, it could be more than your
physical health that will suffer. Independent financial advice could
help you protect yourself against unpleasant eventualities.
''There are many ways in which people can help themselves towards
greater financial security,'' said John MacPhail of MacPhail &amp; Co in
Helensburgh. ''Saving more, investing wisely, boosting pension
provision, checking that you are protected against the downside and
making the most of your tax allowances. If you need to raise extra cash
you normally have three options: to increase your income, draw on
savings, or borrow. This is where your financial adviser can help you.''
By pointing out the pitfalls and helping you choose the best savings
plan for you, independent financial advisers (IFAs) ensure you make the
most of what you've got.
MacPhail &amp; Co has a set of guidelines for producing financial reports.
To begin with, it recommends that you have a reserve fund which is
secure but easily accessible: a bank account or National Savings, for
example.
Then it considers the amount of risk you are prepared to take with
your savings. ''In order to spread your risk it is a good idea to build
yourself a pyramid of investments,'' said Mr MacPhail. ''You can start
with a broad foundation of low-risk investments, then if you have
sufficient funds available, follow up with some medium-risk equity
products. If you are prepared to risk losing some of your money, you can
cap your pyramid with a small exposure to high-risk investments.''
Low-risk investments include building society accounts, TESSAs,
National Savings and guaranteed growth bonds.
In the medium-risk category there are with-profits policies, which are
traditionally only available to regular savers. These invest in a
mixture of shares, property and fixed-interest securities. They usually
provide a guaranteed minimum return plus annual and final bonuses,
depending on the insurance company's investment performance. This type
of policy normally runs for a minimum of 10 years, although the holder
is not usually locked into a lump sum with-profits bond for a fixed
period. It should, however, be viewed as at least a five-year
investment, as penalties may be incurred on surrender if stock market
conditions are poor.
Guaranteed capital investments are also medium-risk. They allow the
investor to profit if share prices rise, but guarantee capital won't be
lost if the stock market falls. These usually run for five years, and
the guarantee does not apply if the investment is surrendered early.
Tax-exempt Friendly Society savings plans run for 10 years. ''The
attraction of these plans is that any investment growth is tax-free,''
said Mr MacPhail. ''However, the level of risk can vary. Some companies
offer low-risk with-profits or fixed-interest plans, while others
provide a more risky share-linked scheme.''
The medium to high-risk investment range includes personal equity
plans (PEPs), unit and investment trusts and unit-linked investments.
PEPs were introduced in 1987 to encourage investors to buy shares. All
gains made on a PEP are tax-free but it is important to remember the
value of investments can fall as well as rise. Unit and investment
trusts were developed to give smaller investors access to the stock
market by allowing them to pool their money and invest in a portfolio of
shares.
The most obvious provision for financial security later in life is
your pension. There are many types of pensions and pension provision
plans -- for example, joining a company scheme, opting out of SERPS (the
state earnings related pension scheme), making additional voluntary
contributions, and starting an individual personal pension.
With such a range to choose from, deciding which is best for you can
be difficult. This would be covered by a specialist pension report
prepared by your IFA.
''If you want a good retirement income you cannot rely on a state
pension alone,'' said Mr MacPhail. ''Even a member of a company pension
scheme cannot afford to become complacent, especially if he or she has
moved jobs in the past. Although people are becoming increasingly aware
that they need to make extra provision themselves if they want to
maintain their standard of living after retirement, many are still not
doing enough.
''It is not always easy to know how much to contribute to your pension
but bear in mind that in order to provide a pension of #10,000 a year, a
fund of around #100,000 or more will be necessary if interest rates are
low when you retire.''
The basic state retirement pension at the moment is #57.60 per week
for a single person and #92.10 per week for a married couple. To qualify
for the state pension, National Insurance must have been paid or
credited for 90% of the individual's working life.
Investing a lump sum for income on retirement is where most people
need advice. However, more often in recent years people who have been
made redundant require help investing their payment or advice on living
on a lower income.
The range of advice available from IFAs covers everything from saving
to life insurance. ''Financial disasters can strike at any time
regardless of whether there is a recession or not,'' said Mr MacPhail.
''If a death, illness or accident occurs it can have a devastating
effect on your family's standard of living. Many people assume that
either the state or the employer will provide the financial support they
need, but this help is often more limited than they realise.''
Many people still underestimate the importance of making a will,
assuming they are not wealthy enough or that their spouse will inhert
everything. The laws of intestacy decide how your estate is divided if
no will is left, and inheritance tax of 40% is payable on estates worth
#150,000 or more.
Even life assurance may not be sufficient to support survivors. Most
people have enough to at least pay off the mortgage loan, but if not
then MacPhail and Co recommends a term assurance policy. ''Term
assurance is taken out for a fixed period and if you die during that
time, it pays out,'' said Mr MacPhail. ''However, there is no savings
element, so if you don't die you get nothing back.
''We would also consider critical illness assurance, income protection
insurance, personal accident insurance, private medical insurance and
long-term care in any report for our clients.''

* GINKGO biloba, the world's oldest living tree species was introduced
to Britain in the eighteenth century. It is alleged that an extract from
its leaves may help to maintain a healthy circulation. The special
properties of Ginkgo leaves were recognised thousands of years ago by
herbalists in China, and the tree became revered throughout the Far
East.
Studies have shown that taking standardised Ginkgo biloba extract --
present in Idoloba tablets -- can help keep the blood flowing more
freely. This is especially important for the brain, where an active
circulation helps ensure it receives the oxygen and nutrients it needs.
Idoloba is available from Boots, Holland Barrett, pharmacies and health
stores priced #9.45 for 30 concentrated tablets.
* GREEN Things was established in 1980 manufacturing an extensive
range of natural-based beauty-care products. They believe that by
harnessing and combining different plant properties, greater care of the
skin and hair can be taken over a longer period of time. Green Things
have never tested products on animals and this is supported by supplier
statements back to 1976.
The company supports the British Union for the Abolition of
Vivisection. It sells a huge range of body care, cleansing, bath care,
hair care and essential oils. Marigold Facial Cleansing Gel is 65p for
30ml and #2.75 for 150ml. Frankincense &amp; Rose Moisturiser for dry skin
is 65p for 10g, and #3.45 for 60g. Other products include Juniper and
Orange Body Shampoo, Neroli Eye Cream and Citronella Insect Repellent.

* BOURJOIS introduces new Duo Liner, two colours which double as
eyeshadows and eyeliner. There are four colour combinations: Esprit de
Printemps, pine green and light ochre; Esprit D'Automne, brown and
vanilla; Esprit d'Hiver, violet and shell pink; and Esprit de Lumiere,
golden brown and pale yellow. The box costs #4.25.
* RIMMEL Silks has brought out a new Colour Performance Lipstick which
provides a velvety demi-matte finish. Enriched with Shea Nut Butter and
Jojoba Oil, the navy and gold packaging is slim and sleek, ensuring that
the right amount of colour is dispensed for each application. Shades
include caramel, true blue-red, pink, damson, raspberry and peach.
Priced #3.99.
* THE Body Shop's new Animals in Danger hats are hard to resist. Made
from 100% cotton in vibrant orange and green, they are perfect for both
adults and children for keeping the sun's rays at bay. They are also
designed to raise awareness on the plight of endangered species around
the world. All branches have Beanie Hats at #3.95, Bandannas at #2.95
and Baseball Caps at #2.95. There are cotton T-shirts in white and
carrying the new bear image in bubble gum brights. Available in both
children's and adult sizes, #6.95 and #8.95.
* SETTLING in to surroundings of Shaker-style simplicity next week
will be Racing Green, that source of classy mail-order casuals, which
opens its third British retail shop in Glasgow on Tuesday at Buchanan
Street, writes Anne Simpson. Buttermilk walls, oak floors and sisal
matting are teamed with cherry-wood furniture in beautifully unfussy
shapes, the decor reflecting exactly the Racing Green philosophy for
pared-down separates, sophisticated in cut and colour.
This latest arrival on the Glasgow shopping scene further strengthens
Buchanan Street's renaissance which aims to make this one of the
smartest thoroughfares in Britain. Meanwhile, in Glassford Street, there
are more name changes to that distinctive art deco building which was
once home to The Warehouse.
A year ago Rita Britton took over the site, calling it The Gallery.
However, after numerous requests and some confusion among customers, she
is reverting to the title, Pollyanna, the name she gave her famous
Barnsley shop 26 years ago, and which remains synonymous with her
reputation as one of Britain's shrewdest fashion savants.

* NEC, one of Japan's largest electronics companies, and VideoLogic,
the UK based multi-media company, have signed an agreement for the joint
development and licence of advanced 3-D games and virtual-reality
technology for home systems as well as arcade and theme-parks. Games
Machines and personal computers equipped with the new technology will

NEC. VideoLogic's new technology, PowerVR, licenced to NEC, has been
under development for three years. It is an advanced 3-D graphics and
virtual-reality system said to be way ahead of conventional
technologies.
* USA scientists used video cameras to monitor cricket and baseball
fielders running after batted balls in a study of how they make a
perfect catch. Apparently players follow a curved path and vary their
speed as they run to catch a ball. The researchers used complex geometry
to show that fielders, as they run, try to make the ball appear to
travel in a straight line. This, apparently, makes sense. Fortunately,
sportsmen do not have to understand this logic, and Frontiers cannot
even pretend to. Apparently it explains why baseball players often run
into the boundary walls while chasing the ball. And here we always
thought they just weren't looking where they were going.
* A four-year salmon study , co-ordinated by two Scots marine labs,
and costing #1 million, could be a boost to fish farming and salmon
fishing in Scotland. The study, co-ordinated by the Marine Labs in
Aberdeen and St Andrews, follows serious concerns that escaped salmon
might breed detrimentally with wild stocks. Scientists plan to rear
sterile salmon which had an abnormal set of chromosomes and would be
unable to breed with wild fish.

the phones are held. Scientific studies show that the cellphones have
only to be a couple of centimetres away from the pacemakers to have an
adverse effect. The good news is that the interference is not great
enogh to cause medical difficulties. Most volunteers didn't even notice.

THE RAINMAKER by John Grisham.
Century. #15.99p
GOD had a hand in writing this the first time round. David and Goliath
He called it and, ever since, scribblers good and bad have been making
variations on the same old theme. Still, most of them have the good
grace to do it only once. John Grisham, on the other hand, makes a habit
of it. And a fortune from it.
Still, if it works once it'll work again. And again. And again. What
saves Grisham from literary mediocrity is the fact that he always finds
a new hook on which to hang the thread of suspense for his vast (and
still growing by the minute) readership.
Now, we are not talking serious literature here. Nothing obscure;
nothing particularly challenging. But, if truth be told, that is not
what most of us want . . . . of a holiday, of a long transatlantic
flight, of a sea cruise, of a night in without the telly. No. What we
want is something which grips us by the throat without any great
intellectual demand. This book fits the bill. Which is why Grisham's
work sells in zillions.
Anyone could have written this. Providing he or she had the
imagination to think up the plot, the ability to sustain the suspense,
the talent to create the words, and the vision to know that the whole
enchillada would work a treat.
The Rainmaker is the diametrical opposite of Grisham's last
blockbusting novel. In The Chamber you had a lawyer attempting, through
the courts, to save the life of an old man who was scheduled for
execution. He failed because, at every turn, the American judicial
system was against him. This time you have a lawyer attempting, through
the courts, to obtain justice for a young man whose life cannot be
saved. The problem is that, at every turn, the American judicial system
is bending over backwards to assist his case.
And it is a problem. It is the gaping flaw in the book. Up until the
last few pages there is never any remote doubt that justice will be seen
to be done. The lawyer hero, ably assisted by a peculiarly partial
judge, just keeps on winning. There is, to be fair, a not insignificant
measure of loss in the (slightly ironic) ending but it comes so late in
the tale that it's almost like an afterthought.
Donny Ray Black is the teenage son of poor, simple white folks living
in the Memphis 'burbs. And he is dying, slowly and painfully, of
leukemia. There is no chance of recovery. But the tragedy is that there
might have been. Some years ago the family took out a medical policy
with the giant Great Benefit Insurance Company. When Donny Ray's
condition was first diagnosed, his doctor started making plans for a
bone marrow transplant (the boy had a twin brother who was eager and
willing to help) which would cost $200,000.
But the wicked insurance company continually denied the claim,
blinding the family with a series of spurious excuses. In so doing, the
fat cat insurers effectively signed the young man's death warrant.
Enter Rudy Baylor, a young man who's not short of problems. Weeks ago
he had the world at his feet. Having just finished college, he was all
set to join a preppy law partnership downtown. Then the firm was taken
over and the new management ditched him immediately. Now he's up to his
neck in debt with no job and no prospects.
With Donny Ray wasting away on his death bed, his mother wants
justice. She wants to bring those giants at Great Benefit to their knees
-- so she gets Rudy to sue them (for about as much money as Grisham
makes on a paperback deal). When Rudy discovers that the insurance
company is represented by the very same Ivy League legal firm who
reneged on the job promise, well, that's just sweet poetic justice for
the young lawyer.
The Rainmaker, despite its faults, is a compulsive, if
easy-on-the-brain-cells, corporate thriller. Grisham neatly maintains
the book's pacy immediacy by writing it in the present tense. He has
created a satisfying tale of revenge which is also something of an
indictment, and a shocking one at that, upon American society. A decent
and innocent young man's death, which could have been avoided, becomes
inevitable because the health service demands cash for life. The
technology, the medicine, and the surgical expertise are all in place --
but a greedy and unscrupulous insurer prevents their use in order to
make a fast buck.
John Grisham, ''the world's bestselling author'' according to the
claim upon the dust jacket, makes no apologies for writing the kind of
book which has now become known as ''the airport novel.'' Why should he
be sorry for his success? He doesn't win literary awards; he wins fat
cheques from his publisher. Grisham's saving grace is that, in a cheap
box of cigars, he provides the $5 Havana.

REPORTS FROM THE PRESENT: Selected Work 1982-94
Tom Leonard
Jonathan Cape, #9.99
IN one of the short pieces in this book Tom Leonard, talking to
himself in the form of notes, rebels against literary conformism in
these words: ''One is not allowed to ask five minutes to be a person, in
freedom alone in the world to read him''. The him is MacDiarmid and the
thought police are the academics and critics who can't see the poetry
for the ''contribution to Modern Scottish Literature'' (Leonard's
quotation marks). He wants the poetry to speak personally to you and me.
Of course, it's up to us to let it happen.
Sitting apart, metaphorically, and thinking straight is Tom Leonard's
strength, whether the subject is literature (he spells it with a capital
L), social justice, or war. Leonard is prickly and thrawn, which may not
make comfortable reading, but it cuts through cant.
The Gulf War dominated the later years of the period covered by these
essays and poems. No prizes for guessing where Leonard stands on that.
Observing that he was brought up in ''the slightly comfortable belief''
that the German people shamefully turned a blind eye to Nazi atrocities,
he is appalled at our indifference to the inhumanities of the Gulf War
perpetrated and sanctified in our name: ''Now I know only too well that
my own country can be firing Cruise missiles into foreign cities whilst
the topic hanging over Glasgow whilst this is going on, is whether or
not Ally McCoist will be on the bench or the park that afternoon''.
This is from a piece titled: ''What I Hate About the News is its
Definite Article''. The news, as distinct from just news, is the
packaging we give it, conditioned by all sorts of prejudice and
hypocrisy.
A less momentous event than the war on Iraq, Glasgow's elevation to be
European City of Culture in 1990, had its own share of hype and
doublespeak. Leonard was famously one of the band of malcontents who
opted out of the celebrations. He produced a cut-out ''Handy Form for
Artists'' to be used when asked to support, comment on, or contribute
work to the programme, complete with alternative responses to be deleted
as appropriate. The options include ''the slogan is a nasty piece of
advertising language'' and ''City Culture yes City of a Culture yes City
of Culture no''.
Another slogan which aroused his ire is Glasgow's Miles Better, or
rather the Mr Happy who trots along beside it. One of his most telling
pieces is the satirical little tale -- in ''are you sitting comfortably,
children?'' mode -- ''Mr Chesty Burns the Fried Bread''. Mr Chesty, who
rises early in the morning, turns out to be a blob of phlegm not a
million miles away from the happy wee chap who once again graces the
facade of Glasgow City Chambers.
The poetry and prose in this collection -- some of the verse only a
few lines -- have appeared in a variety of outlets from satirical
political pamphlets to the newspapers. In one case, not -- it's a
response to the Independent declining to contribute. Other pieces such
as Mr Chesty have been performed by Leonard.
The stripped-down poetry can be haunting and vivid, even when it's a
trip round the supermarket and barely more than a list of items on the
shelves. I lost the drift in some of the weightier pieces and I'm not so
keen on the straight lit crit. For me, Leonard works best as a thorn in
the flesh.
There's a spin-off. Thanks to this book I'm now going to catch up with
the American poet Charles Reznikoff, whose work I don't know. And I want
to get Leonard's anthology of worker poets called Radical Renfrew
(published by Polygon), the introduction to which is included in this
book, together with some good excerpts.

With domestic milk deliveries becoming a rarity, an unusual
exhibition displays bottles of a fine vintage. William Hunter explains
WAITING to be lifted at John Malden's front door were museum pieces.
Day after day and in all weathers they stood there on the step. Not
thinking, he picked them up and took them in. It's what most people do
with milk bottles, but not everybody.
John Malden found he was starting to treasure some empties.
It is not a proper way to treat milk bottles. Good customers
afterwards give them a wash and put them promptly out again for the
milkman. Hoarding is wrong behaviour. His excuse for it is that his
magpie eye had been attracted by how some bottles had advertisements on
them.
''Because they were unusual, I kept them,'' he confessed. ''Gradually,
over about three years, I had about 20 varied milk bottles.'' When that
many empties are in one place, they breed. He became further hooked when
he heard that a collection of pretty bottles in Northumbria had been
offered to the Milk Marketing Board, who did not want them.
''The next thing I knew was that 11 crates of English bottles had
arrived,'' he tried to explain. ''And so my interest grew. Then my
museum hat came to the fore. I wondered why not have a wee display?''
Which is why at Barrhead Museum, where John Malden is the curator,
there is a summer show called Please Rinse and Return, a sparkling
little exhibition of milk bottles with adverts on them. Some bottles are
of 70-year vintage. Together, they are doorstep history.
Some are beautiful, some quaint. Others contain nostalgia in the names
they have of long-gone dairies. All of them carry messages which the
past, like a shipwrecked mariner, has put on bottles.
Among the survivors are little ones that held one-third of a pint of
school milk. ''They don't seem nearly as large as they used to be,''
Malden mused.
For his Barrhead exhibition he has amassed about a gross of bottles,
most of them from the private museum of an Ayrshire collector, Margaret
Barber. She used to have thousands and thousands, she said. There were
American bottles, some Turkish, many of other nationalities, lots of
English ones, all sorts of bottles. She has since melted down the total
on her farmhouse shelves to 700 or so, all Scottish.
She said there were only three other collectors in Scotland.
Elsewhere, however, are serious numbers. Throughout Britain she could
count 100 bottle people. They even have their own quarterly newsheet,
Milk Bottle News.
''There is a whole world out there,'' Barber said.
Most of the enthusiasts are former milkmen and dairy farmers who used
to have a milk round. She breeds Suffolk sheep. It does not make her
hobby easier to explain.
''I would like to collect antiques but I can't afford them,'' she
replied to a question she may have answered a million times before.
Early bottles had wide necks which were stoppered with cardboard
discs. At Barrhead they steal the show. They have a vase-like elegance.
In their mouths a rose would not look out of place.
When aluminium caps replaced cardboard, bottles were given narrower
lips. Really, they evolved from the neck down to their dumpy modern
shape that is handier and cheaper to transport.
It was also for economic reasons that early bottles began to be
decorated. Dairymen had their names embossed on them because they were
their bottles and they wanted them back.
Extra artistic touches in time came to be added -- flowers, thistles,
and other little flourishes. Balgownie Dairy moulded on a view of the
Brig o' Balgownie. For its railway family customers the Cowlairs Co-op,
Glasgow, pictured a steam train with The right line for health for a
legend.
Violetbank Milk, Annan, came with the scene of a kiltie and his lass
hiking past a road sign that pointed To Health. McGhies, of Lochmaben
and Dumfries, greeted customers with a bright, red-lettered Good
Morning!
Commercial ads for other products started in the 1950s, faded for a
while, then revived. Just about anything that can be advertised has
since been given a milk base.
It was too good an opportunity to miss. Even genteel families who
decanted their pints into jugs for the table took time to read the
bottle label.
Door locks, computerised horoscopes, toothpaste, and even a Sunday
newspaper have bought bottle space. For customers who had got home only
a little before their early-morning milkman, one dairyman carried a
commercial for liver salts. It showed a Pink Panther, except it was
green.
Good advice was sometimes attached. One bottle had a Highway Code
lesson. Another gives a nine-line lecture on taking care with fireworks
on bonfire nights.
John Malden has found room for a showcase of the cardboard caps, which
tended to be didactic about keeping healthy and fit. But they also made
gambling chips for playground games at school that included a kind of
juggling and a form of hoopla. Wool pompons were created on them.
Apart from scrap, aluminium foil caps have much less utility, although
Malden said they were good for scouring pans that milk had been boiled
in. It was something he learned at boarding school.
Barrhead claims to have the first museum exhibition ever in the UK
devoted to milk bottles with advertising on them, which may well be so.
Please Rinse and Return runs until September 2.

I have always been very ambitious and I've always worked hard and I've
always had a restless sort of search for knowledge, I suppose.
SIMON Heffer is 34. It is necessary to emphasise this because it is
remarkably easy to forget. He is a clever young man who does not, and
appears never to have, suffered from the problems of moral indiscipline,
political doubt or fools. Heffer is the person whoever it was had in
mind when he or she invented the phrase ''young fogey.''
He has written an impressive book about Thomas Carlyle, which appeared
last month to critical acclaim, although not in this paper where John
Campbell gave it a distinctly hostile review. Heffer is deputy editor of
the Daily Telegraph and former deputy editor of the Spectator. He writes
a fluent column of political polemic, is a close personal friend of
Enoch Powell, and despises John Major only slightly more than Tony
Blair.
In many ways he appears to be a complete monster. His political
certainty gives him an arrogance that gets way up people's noses. And
yet, despite all his pomposity and his attitudes and his convictions, he
has a huge sense of fun. He enjoys himself: he likes the company of all
manner of people whose views he does not necessarily share, he likes
entertaining, he delights in food and fine wine, he relishes his home,
his wife Diana, and their 18-month-old son Fred. He enjoys life (which
makes it all the more difficult that he is an atheist).
Yet even despite this appreciation of tangible, earthly delights, his
intellectuality seems to have repressed something natural about the
spirit of youth. Indeed, he never seems to have had much youth.
He has no interest in modern culture: he never goes to the cinema or
the theatre -- although he has a cupboardful of old British films from
the 1930s and 1940s, mostly one suspects to help reinforce his
prejudices about the country's decline. He is out of the house (a
charming, hospitable old farm house -- listed, of course -- complete
with gumboots and plans for an Aga, surrounded by grass appropriate for
croquet and beyond that the flat farmland of rural Essex) for at least
12 hours a day; and in the evening, now that the book is written, he
reads and talks to Diana.
He has always had very sophisticated tastes, he vouchsafes, and has
read no work of fiction published since 1960 (the year, incidentally, of
his birth).
Certainly nothing, he tells me, that I would call popular fiction,
never. He shudders if you mention Martin Amis. He reads very little
fiction at all ''because I read it all when I was younger'' and now
therefore, if he is driven to consult a novel, it is only for purposes
of historical documentation.
He loves classical music -- Wagner provided the aural wallpaper while
he wrote his book about Carlyle -- but has no interest at all in popular
music. ''I always looked down on long-haired smelly people who went to
pop concerts,'' he said when I questioned him about this. I point out
that I went to pop concerts and have always been fastidious about
personal hygiene; he waves away my irrelevance. He did work in a pub
during his university vacations, but the only racy thing he seems to
have done is secure expulsion from the Cambridge University Conservative
Association for electoral malpractice.
''I have always been very ambitious and I've always worked hard and
I've always had a restless sort of search for knowledge, I suppose.'' He
feels, to some extent, fulfilled now that he has committed some of that
knowledge into a scholarly biography and this has a particular relevance
to his atheism.
He believes there is a logical explanation for everything and much
envies his wife and older friends, like Enoch, who are reassured by
their faith. ''It's very depressing for me because I have nothing to
look forward to. I just find it bloody depressing''. His logical
approach is one reason why he does not enjoy the theatre, and
interestingly his explanation of this produced a revelatory admission.
''I don't have a very vivid imagination. It's a great problem: I can't
suspend reality.''
He grew up in a comfortable home, the child of tax inspectors (''they
met inspecting taxes''). His father, who was 62 when Simon was born,
died when he was 10. He had no urge to rebel and seems genuinely puzzled
about why anyone from a middle-class home should wish to do so. Define
middle-class ? ''We have always owned our own homes, we spoke Received
Pronunciation and held our knives and forks properly,'' he said with
great precision. He had lots of girlfriends before he was married and
got his kicks in rather conventional ways, he said. ''I didn't have to
go to pop festivals to pick up totty.''
Now you can make of this what you will ? Is it cultivated image?
Certainly all his pastimes are of a piece. What are his other leisure
pursuits? He watches cricket, he shoots (What? ''Anything that moves,
really''), he is fascinated by architecture (he waves at the collected
Pevsner in his meticulously organised book-lined study).
And now: why Carlyle? A central figure of mid-Victorian letters who
Heffer accepts was ''in many regards an appalling man'', he has been
somewhat neglected by the biography trade, largely because he wrote in
such a tortured style, he was so idiosyncratic and there was so much of
it -- 30 volumes, including the eight-volume biography of Frederick the
Great which took him 13 years to write, and 21 volumes of letters. It
was obviously worthwhile writing about a man who was immensely important
and has not been much studied, rather than, as Heffer says, producing
yet another book about Dickens or Ruskin.
In his first term at Cambridge, under what he subsequently discovered
was a foolhardy understanding that it was requisite upon undergraduates
to attend lectures, he had embarked upon a course on ''The Victorian
Social Problem Novel''. He found that he profoundly disagreed with all
the lecturer's judgments on individual authors, so when he excoriated
Carlyle, Heffer sat up and took an interest. He spent the next 10 years
reading 150 books either by or about Carlyle, was commissioned by Lord
Weidenfeld in 1992 and wrote 60,000 words in the first month.
Heffer says of his subject: ''He was a fascist in some respects. He
was a whinger, a hypochondriac and was saturated in self-pity. That made
him interesting. With all those moral failings and psychological
failings he still had all the energy and commitment to produce the work
that he did.''
He was a man permanently struggling with himself, partly as a result
of the particular Calvinist sect to which his family belonged and which
was, Heffer says, ''pretty barking, even by Scottish standards.'' The
family made huge sacrifices to send Carlyle to study divinity and he was
due to go into the church. The problem with which he wrestled for seven
years, from the age of 19, was his realisation that he did not believe
in Jesus Christ.
Then, in 1821, while walking down Leith Walk from the centre of
Edinburgh to swim in the Firth of Forth as he did every afternoon, he
had some form of intellectual revelation, a great moment of truth; what
he was to call ''the everlasting 'No' ''.
It was that God existed, but that Jesus Christ did not. He was, says
Heffer, a bit like the last Bishop of Durham in that respect.
One wonders if there is some sort of symmetry between author and
subject, although it is also clear from our conversation that Heffer did
not come to like Carlyle, or feel much sympathy for him. He agrees that
this is the case. But while he did not share a lot of Carlyle's views,
he still found him to be greatly entertaining -- and that, oddly enough,
is a view that many people have about Simon Heffer.

A #2m advertising campaign is to be launched in the autumn emphasising
the importance of meat as part of a balanced diet.
Speaking at the Scotsheep '95 event at Weststruther, Berwickshire,
yesterday Don Curry, chairman of the Meat and Livestock Commission said:
''We have tolerated too long the misinformation on the healthiness of
meat.''
There was now real concern in the Department of Health at levels of
anemia in the population, he said. Children, young people generally and
young mothers were particularly susceptible.
''It is a serious problem of iron deficiency and for that reason the
department is very willing to support this campaign of ours.
''Iron in meat is very easily assimilated into the body. This message
hasn't been promoted strongly enough and we now need to promote meat as
the best source of iron.''
Medical opinion had identified fat as a serious problem and the
message had gone out that meat should be avoided because it contained
fat, he said. However, a great deal of effort had gone into ensuring
that meat was no longer as fat as once it was.
Farmers were being encouraged to produce lean animals.
Before the launch of the press advertising campaign the MLC will be
targeting doctors and other health professionals with the healthy meat
message. Every doctor's surgery and health centre will receive material
on nutrition, fat, and iron.
''We have worked very closely with the department of health to ensure
that our information is factual and endorsed by them,'' said Mr Curry.
In his opening speech at Scotsheep, which attracted an attendance of
more than 10,000, he emphasised the need to produced lean, well fleshed
lambs. Using industry funds the MLC was prepared to go on the offensive
on fat, he said.
''But this is a partnership -- we all need to play our part so there
must be a regular supply of good, lean, lambs to support the advertising
messages and help build the image.''
Despite the success of promotional campaigns and export drives it was
irritating that production constraints within the quota system had
resulted in a smaller productive flock at a time when market
opportunities were available.
It was a matter of concern that over the last three years the number
of lambs marketed had fallen substantially. The British industry was the
most efficient in Europe and should be allowed to exploit market
opportunities in Europe, he said.
''I do think the issue of quota transfer between EU member states
should be further examined,'' he said. ''Any shortfalls across Europe
should be available for member states like ourselves who produce more.''
Farmers might have to look very closely at the financial viability of
producing outwith quota, he suggested.
The advisory bodies could perhaps help in increasing output without
consequent rises in overheads.

<HEADLINE>Craig ups offer for Wallets. New price tag is 50% more at #1.5m</HEADLINE>

THE takeover battle for the Castle Douglas auction firm of Wallets
Marts has been stepped up with James Craig increasing their offer by
almost 50%.
The Ayr-based auctioneering of Craigs has boosted its bid for the
shares of Wallets to #12 each in the latest round of the takover battle.
The new offer values the Castle Douglas firm, famous for its Galloway
cattle shows and sales, at #1.5m compared with the first offer of #8.50
a share which put a value of just over #1m on it.
Craigs says that the offer is double the most recent price at which
Wallets shares have been traded and they have given shareholders until
June 9 to accept the new and increased final cash offer.
In a letter to Wallets Marts shareholders, Michael Craig, chairman of
James Craig, says the offer is made in response to a number of Wallets
shareholders who approached them with view to taking over what they saw
as a poorly managed company.
Since making the original offer, the directors of Craigs have elicited
substantially more information about the Wallets Marts operations and Mr
Craig adds: ''We believe we have now unearthed the true value of Wallets
Marts shares.''
In its offer document, James Craig comments: ''Wallets' overall
profitability appears to depend heavily on non-core activities such as
commissions on property sales and valuations fees. Both turnover and
operating profits have dropped in the last financial year yet Wallets
directors propose to distribute more than two thirds of profit after tax
as dividend.
''In contrast James Craig displays an excellent financial record.
Profits in the year to January 31 this year increased by 47% to #190,000
and, in the previous year, #2.2m of exceptional profit was invested in a
new, modern mart at Ayr.''
James Craig, says the chairman, also questions why two separate
valuations of Wallets Marts properties were carried out and why only one
has been made available to shareholders.
The directors of Craigs have stressed their commitment to Castle
Douglas which would run alongside the existing operations at Ayr and
Newton Stewart. If the offer is successful they say they plan to expand
the services available at Castle Douglas and develop a more competitive
mart.
Mr Craig has invited all of Wallets shareholders to a meeting at
Castle Douglas Town Hall next Wednesday where he and his fellow
directors will be on hand to answer any questions.
There was no reaction from the Wallets board last night but so far
they have advised their shareholders to take no action on any offers.

GLAXO Wellcome, the world's biggest drugs company, received a boost
yesterday with news that the US Food and Drug Administration had
approved a patent extension on its ulcer drug Zantac to 1997. Shares in
Glaxo Wellcome rose 3p to 729p following the announcement.
Generic drug makers and suppliers said they were shocked by the
decision. The National Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and
the National Pharmaceutical Alliance in the US, said the decision could
cost consumers using generic drugs as much as $6000m.
The extention means that Glaxo will have the benefit of an extra six
to seven months trading with no competition in the US, the world's
largest pharmaceutical market.
Under world trade regulations, competitors with generic versions of
Zantac could be permitted to launch their products before the new patent
expiry date if they fulfil certain criteria. In March, Glaxo called for
a delay in granting approval to new generic versions until these
extended patents expire.
The extra money earned as a result of the extention will come in handy
given the huge costs associated with integrating its recent #9100m
Wellcome acquisition. The company is due to publish a full statement on
the pace and cost of integrating the two drug businesses in September
when it publishes unaudited second interim results.
As many as 15,000 jobs could be lost out of a combined workforce of
62,000. Potential cost savings from combining the two companies,
estimated at as much as #1000m per annum, will be a key driver of
earnings growth over the next few years. The board of Glaxo Wellcome has
changed its year-end to December to facilitate comparisons with other
pharmaceutical companies.
Zantac was launched 14 years ago for the treatment of peptic ulcers
and gastric acid related diseases. It has been the world's best-selling
prescription medicine and a major contributor to Glaxo's earnings for
several years.
Although it remains a best-seller, increasing competition from cheaper
generic or unbranded drugs, and growing use of new types of ulcer
treatment, proton pump inhibitors such as Losec and antibacterial
treatments effective against Helicobacter pylori, are nibbling away at
its market share.
Last year, Zantac accounted for 43% of Glaxo's sales at #2442m. Its
share of the world anti-ulcer market slipped to 35% from 37% in 1993.
Losec, produced by Astra of Sweden accounted for 4% of the British
pharmaceutical market last year, overtaking Zantac which took under 4%
after peaking at almost 5% in 1991.
The days when companies could launch a drug and then just sit back and
watch the money roll in year after year are long gone. A greater
emphasis on value for money by the world's largest industrialised
nations coupled with the growing inroads being made by generic drugs has
made life tougher for the industry. All companies whatever there size
are aware of the need to be clearly offering value for money.
Larger pharmaceutical groups such as Glaxo, Zeneca, and SmithKline
Beecham, have traditionally had a heavy focus on research and
development to produce a steady stream of innovative products. The cost
of such drug treatments is invariably less than the cost of having to
admit patients to hospital. This trading approach is even more important
these days if companies are seeking premium prices for their products.
However, the cost of bringing a product to market is upwards of #100m
taking into account the costly clinical trails that have to be carried
out before regulatory approval will be given. These costs have to be
recouped in drug prices in order to provide funds for future R &amp; D
projects.

HYDRO-ELECTRIC has won a contract worth more than #20m a year to
supply electricity to 260 Tesco supermarkets in England and Wales.
Last year Tesco acquired the Dundee-based retail group William Low
which was already supplied by Hydro-Electric. Now the Perth-based power
company will supply more than 300 Tesco stores throughout the UK.
Industry sources said the new contract would boost Hydro-Electric's
revenue by #20m to #30m per year.
Sales manager Richard Seddon said yesterday: ''This contract gives a
major boost to our rapidly growing position as a leading UK-wide energy
supplier.
''At present 19% of our business comes from south of the Border and
our success in adding this prominent contract to our portfolio is a
further strong step towards a significant share of the UK energy
market.''
In April last year, the electricity market opened up to allow
customers with a maximum annual demand above 100kw to buy their
electricity on the open market.

The extent of the problems facing retailers of electrical goods was
brought home yesterday with the announcement that Powerhouse Retail was
seeking a buyer for its electricals business. It is believed that
Powerhouse will be sold because of a continuous decline in retail sales.
The business consists of the retail activities of three privatised
regional electricity companies (RECs) Eastern Group, Midlands
Electricity, and Southern Electric.
In a statement, Powerhouse said it was in discussions with a number of
parties about the potential sale of the company. ScottishPower could
well decide to expand its retail franchise into areas outside its
existing Inverness to Bury St Edmunds axis. Its retailing business is
profitable. Last year, it made #9.9m although profits growth of #1.5m
was held back by the costs associated with refurbishing its acquired
Clydesdale shops. A margin improvement is expected in 1995/96.
The company expects to report a loss of #7m in the year to April 1995
and will incur one-off charges of around #16m before interest and tax.
The three companies will be making provisions in their annual results to
cover the costs. Eastern and Southern Electric will be providing #50m
before tax -- #40m after an associated credit -- and Midlands
Electricity is setting aside #40m before tax -- #30m after
tax-associated credits.

ON June 6, 10 young Aberdonians are due to embark on a pioneering
course intended to turn them from raw school leavers into junior
entrepreneurs. They will be the first Scots to undergo the NFTE
experience.
For the uninitiated, NFTE (known to its friends as Nifty) stands for
the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship. It's a US
invention, founded by Steve Mariotti in 1987 as a mechanism to help
young people escape from inner city deprivation and depression. It has
been brought to Scotland by Scottish Enterprise, which has negotiated a
deal with Mariotti to launch 20 pilot programmes this year.
The Aberdeen youngsters, from the Tilly Youth Project, will spend 80
hours over three weeks learning the essentials of starting a business.
They will receive the famous NFTE ''biz bag'' containing guidebooks,
calculator, pencils, sales receipt books and a watch -- the latter to
reinforce the message that, perhaps for the first time in their lives,
time is money.
When they emerge they should have the basic knowledge required to
start a business, and an idea for that business. Hopefully, most of them
will have also acquired the essential accompaniments of aspiration and
confidence.
In America one in seven of NFTE's students start a business that goes
on to survive beyond the first year. That may not seem a high
proportion, until you consider that the organisation is working with
young people who possess no previous knowledge of, or interest in, the
world of business.
Naturally, Scottish Enterprise hopes NFTE translates happily to
Scotland and our less than positive cultural environment. That's a
significant unknown quantity, although logic suggests that as young
people are only too aware of how bleak their prospects are outside
school, they should be motivated to make the most of this opportunity.
The initiative is the latest in a veritable stream of projects aimed
at boosting the enterprise culture through our education system. This
year, for example, some 3000 teachers -- 7% of the total -- are expected
to experience a three-day placement with a local company.
Similarly, a growing number of 15 and 16-year-olds have their own work
experience exercise. Such links are being encouraged by the Education
Business Partnerships that operate in every local enterprise company
area.
Last Monday saw the launch of the important Schools Enterprise
Programme, which will provide special training for teachers and support
material for their pupils about the topic of entrepreneurialism.
Spanning the spectrum from five to 14, the programme encourages classes
to set up their own businesses, thus tying in with the successful Young
Enterprise Programme under which final-year secondary pupils establish
and operate actual companies.
One of the most impressive components of Schools Enterprise is the
Journey to Enterprise pack for primary schools in which the concept of
business and wealth creation is introduced sensitively and positively. I
am continually appalled at the number of children's books which purport
to be about the world of work, but in fact deal only with the
old-fashioned concepts of employment and bosses.
And still there's more. The Understanding Industry programme
introduces fifth and sixth year secondary pupils into companies to spend
time tracking their senior people. Meanwhile, later in June Scottish
Enterprise is due to announce the universities that have won support
funding to establish two Centres of Entrepreneurial Study based on
Babson College in Boston.
It goes almost without saying -- so to be pedantic I will repeat it --
that a huge task still lies ahead to reorientate our education system so
young people emerge properly equipped to tackle the uncertain future of
work and enterprise. There seems a consensus among teachers that while
the spirit of creativity and initiative is allowed to flourish at
primary stage, it is squashed at secondary schools thanks to the
curriculum's rigid focus on subjects and exams.
The essential question that remains is how to amend the curriculum so
this spirit emerges from schools not just intact but positively
reinforced. We have to work towards a situation where the concept of
business and wealth creation becomes as much a part of our learning as
reading and writing. In other words, we must offer our young people a
smooth path from P1 to Plc.

WHEN Charter Group sold its mining equipment interests, including the
Motherwell-based Anderson Group, to American buyer Marmon in February,
it appeared Charter's impact on the Lanarkshire economy had passed with
the transfer of ownership across the Atlantic.
But, last August, in a much bigger acquisition, Charter had bought
Esab, the Swedish world leader in the manufacture of welding equipment.
That #286m deal, regarded by some observers as an inspired move, means
the group retains a distinct, if indirect, influence on Lanarkshire's
economic fortunes.
For the area boasts one of only two Scottish-based manufacturers of
welding rods, the consumable electrodes market dominated by Esab. WB
Alloy Products is an independent company which has been in the business
for 21 years. In June 1993 it was the focus of a management buy-out by a
team which has since opened a branch in Darlington, in the North-east of
England, and now plans a further expansion into Birmingham.
That team, led by managing director John Oliver, himself a trained
welder who once worked on the ill-fated Iolair semi-submersible
contract, the last job to leave the Scott Lithgow yard on the Lower
Clyde, competes with the might of Esab and other industry leaders by
emphasising the diversity of its product range and its ability to come
up with a special rod for each and every exotic welding seam devised by
fabricators.
Coatbridge-based WB claims to make the widest range of welding rods of
any manufacturer in the UK, some 60 in all. But neither Oliver nor the
rest of the WB management team -- Neil Ward, the sales director; Alan
Bruce, the production director; John Sinclair, the finance director, and
Alan Blackley, the non-executive chairman -- would claim for a moment
that the David and Goliath battle against the likes of Esab is easy.
As a relatively small player in the sector -- the average order size
in a projected #1.5m turnover this year is around #200 -- WB faces a
long, slow struggle to prise open the procurement channels of major
fabricators and engineering groups used to specifying rods from industry
leaders such as Esab.
And the WB team, although strongly committed to their Scottish roots
and their Coatbridge manufacturing base, recognise that decades of
industrial decline here have shrunk the demand base for their particular
product range. The Darlington opening and that planned for Birmingham
are designed to compensate for the shrinking business base north of the
Border.
When the team bought control of WB, the company had a small, but
poorly located, sales presence in Berwick-on-Tweed. That was shut and
the search began for a more effectively sited outpost. Oliver recalls
their first visit to Darlington. ''We got out of the car and the place
really seemed to be buzzing. We could feel the industrial estates we
looked at throbbing with work. But the locals said: 'Why do you want to
come down here? It's dead down here.' By our standards, it was really
alive.''
Last year, #300,000 of WB's #1.13m turnover was generated by
Darlington. The team have high hopes that a Birmingham base, pencilled
in for opening this autumn, will add to the trend.
And, after persistent but unavailing efforts to open up the really big
customers, such as the North Sea fabricators, to what WB's product range
has to offer, Oliver is just beginning to detect some chinks in their
armour which may yield positive results.
The benchmark rod for the North Sea, he points out, is the 56S
developed by Philips, the multi-national better known for its consumer
electronics. ''The North Sea was built on the 56S,'' he says. Some eight
years ago that particular Philips business was acquired by Esab, which
now dominates supplies to the offshore sector.
Oliver speaks with feeling about the way the old Philips 56S rod is
still specified by name on rig and platform drawings and built into
rigid order procedures by the fabricators. ''If they can't get supplies,
procedures don't mean a thing. But if we go knocking on the door
offering an alternative, these same procedures stop us breaking into the
market.''
Now, with a non-standard rod designed for stainless steel welding
which has been tested favourably against rival offerings from the big
boys, WB has high hopes of a breakthrough order with one of the major
Scottish-based fabricators. ''That's just sheer persistence,'' says
Oliver.
Making welding rods is something of a black art. The core wires are
bought in by the thousand. They come in various grades of steel, have to
be perfectly round, free of grease and any ragged edges. Ironically,
despite persistent attempts to get supplies from British metal
companies, WB has found its best source of reliable quality wire is
Sweden.
The cores are then coated with a chemical mix of materials such as
sand, calcium carbonate, felspar, wood flour and iron powder. The art is
in mixing them to the precise specification needed for a particular
welding task. When a thin layer of the material -- at this point like a
low moisture dough -- is extruded on to each wire, the rod is then
air-dried and baked in an oven.
The completed rods can cost as little as #3 a kilo or as much as #40,
depending on how exotic the specification is. WB currently sells around
80% of its output -- 500,000 kilogrammes this year -- in the commodity
end of the business. But, in its competitive battle with the big boys,
that ability to turn the group's expertise to the more complex rods (the
other 20% of sales) may be where the real expansion and certainly the
best margins are to be found.
There is even the prospect of sub-contracting the manufacture of some
of the more exotic rods from the major players who are increasingly
geared up to volume production.
Apart from making and selling rods, the WB business also gets around
20% of total turnover from merchanting a range of welding supplies, from
gloves and helmets to whole items of welding plant, and from a service
facility for the repair and exchange of gas equipment, including torch
nozzles and gas regulators. WB is one of only two companies officially
approved by the British Compressed Gases Association to do that kind of
work.
WB Alloy Products was set up by Bert Ward in 1974 as a distributor of
welding products. First based in Gartcosh, it then moved to Queenslie
and finally to Coatbridge, to a 20,000 sq ft redundant chemical works.
Its move into manufacturing its own rods really took off when the
company acquired an experienced lab manager from the Philips business in
the eighties. The company then gained BS5750 accreditation.
Ward wasn't getting any younger. And the question of what would happen
to the business longer term was raising its head. John Oliver, who had
moved from welding on his own account to sales with WB, and colleague
Neil Ward first made an approach five years ago about a buy-out. They
were rebuffed. But later Ward came back and said he was ready to talk.
It was a protracted process, lasting at least a year. Advised by Alan
Blackley, now their chairman, the team first moved down the road of a
conventional commercial buy-out, backed by 3i. During the process
Ravenscraig closed. The would-be backers took cold feet at a deal
involving such a traditional craft as welding. So the team had to start
again.
This time they managed to put together a deal with backing from
Scottish Enterprise, the Lanarkshire Development Agency and Bank of
Scotland (through Lanarkshire Action). The Royal Bank and Strathclyde
Region came up with loan support. John Sinclair, with 25 years of
contracting experience with Hamilton-based EJ Stiell, came on board as
finance director. The deal was done, and a business employing 46 people
became the team's responsibility.
Yes, welding is changing, says Oliver. In particular MIG welding -- in
which a reel of wire is fed to a gas-shielded welding head -- is
becoming increasing commonplace. ''Every backstreet blacksmith now has
his MIG plant,'' he says. ''But there's still a lot of years left in
stick welding. We are a bunch of young guys bursting with ideas. This is
a very good little business. There's a lot of mileage left in us yet.''

DROUGHT in Australia, falling beef prices in New Zealand and lower
margins in Germany, hit Grampian Holdings' vetinerary medicine business
during the first part of this year.
But the Glasgow-based group reported brisk sales of animal healthcare
products in the UK and a good performance by its sports equipment,
knitwear and transport divisions.
Chairman Bill Hughes told the group's annual general meeting in
Glasgow yesterday that Grampian had made a ''promising start'' to the
year.
Grampian Holdings announced pre-tax profits of #8.5m last year on
turnover of #138m. Sales of animal healthcare products amounted to #48m
and brought in half of group profits.
Explaining the current downturn in export sales of vetinerary drugs,
Mr Hughes said the drought in Australia had reduced the number of
parasites on livestock and had therefore reduced demand for Grampian
drugs to treat them.
Falling beef prices in New Zealand had, meanwhile, cut farmers'
incomes leading to a cutback in spending on animal healthcare products,
he added.
Mr Hughes said sales of vetinerary medicines in Germany remained
buoyant, but margins had been squeezed by recent investments in product
improvement and quality control that Grampian had not yet passed on to
customers.
''It's a volume problem in Australia and New Zealand and a margin
problem in Germany,'' he concluded.
Mr Hughes said sales of golf equipment were doing well, partly because
1995 is a Ryder Cup year and Grampian clothing is used by participants
in the event.
The chairman said royalty income from the group's Patrick sports
shoes, most of which are manufactured in the Far East and sold in
Scandinavia, Germany, and Japan, was on schedule.
Knitwear sales by Edinburgh Wollen Mill, in which Grampian has a 25%
stake, were up during the first four months of the year, he added, and
the group's road haulage business WH Malcolm, was thriving.
Mr Hughes said Grampian had also been able to reduce its debt because

CORPORATE tax lawyer Angus Wright of Maclay Murray &amp; Spens is off to
Russia next month with his bike. He will climb aboard to cover the 700km
between St Petersburg and Moscow to raise funds for a Russian children's
charity.
Around 80 people are taking part in the marathon event which starts in
St Petersburg on June 22 and finishes in the first city on July 2. Each
participant must raise #2000, but thanks to the generosity of his firm
and its clients Wright, a former triathlete, has already been promised
#3000. Quite rightly, however, he is looking for more.
Friends of Russian Children and Project Hope, the organisers of the
bike ride, will use the proceeds to help children with burns in Moscow,
where the treatment for injuries of this type is sadly lacking.
Anyone who would like to offer a donation should contact Michael
Walker at Maclay Murray &amp; Spens on 0141 248 5011.
Go-ahead gents
hit City road
WE have all heard about fast movers in the City but are Angus Grossart
and Tom Farmer not really past that stage of their careers?
It seems there is a new ''kwik'' transport service between Heathrow
and London, which entails the passenger getting astride the pillion of a
motorbike complete with helmet and zooming past all the other execs
ensconced in their traffic-bound limos.
I would never suggest that either man should slow down, but there
comes a time when we all have to accept our age. Meanwhile, Business
Diary would be grateful for a photo of our go-ahead City gents proving
that they really are the ''oldest swingers in town''.
Knocked out for
a good cause
DO all your best ideas seem to come when you are soaking in the bath?
Certainly this is what happened to David Sellyn of Pannell Kerr Forster
last Saturday when he was reading the weekend's Business Diary.
Sellyn, who tells me he was alone in the bath at the time, was
recovering from a hectic day participating in a charity It's a Knockout
event, when it struck him he should send us along some details of the
day's activities.
It may be, he admits, that he was motivated by the fact that the PKF
team captained by Amanda Nottingham had won the contest, beating around
30 other teams including ScotRail, TSB, Slater Hogg and Babcock.
The PKF entry was truly a team effort as staff from PLC, the firm's
grant specialist and joint-venture partner, helped make up the numbers.
Sellyn believes its hard fought win was a triumph of age over youth as
with him in the team were managing partner Bryan Jackson and director
Charles Raskin. Between them the trio have a combined age somewhat in
excess of 120.
The event was a great success and raised more than #5000 for child
victims of crime, although Sellyn admits that many of the younger
spectators in the 1000-plus crowd at the Crownpoint Arena seemed more
interested in getting the autographs of Gladiators Trojan, Panther and
Cobra who were in attendance, than in watching the heroic antics of
PKF/PLC.
Irish tale of the
Scots English
I KNOW that just about anyone, even myself, qualifies to play for Jack
Charlton's Irish football team, but the English Ladies' Curling
Champions really take the biscuit in that department.
Everyone in the team lives in Scotland, and they won the English
championship in Perth earlier this year. But Business Diary is assured
that each of the ladies was born in England and has English parents.
CALA Homes, which is sponsoring the team with a #1000 donation to help
them compete in the European Championships at Grindelwald in Switzerland
in December, explained that the English championships were held in
Scotland because it is cheaper to hire a curling rink up here than to go
to the expense of putting markings on one in England for the occasion.
To add to the confusion, it appears that the team has no proper name.
In which case they are likely to be introduced at the European
Championships as ''the English champions who have travelled all the way
from Scotland''.
The four bonny fechters in our midst are skip Janice Manson, Sarah
Johnston, Pam Wright and Jane Johnston.
Touching story
of rugby rout
A FIRM of property consultants is in danger of finding itself in the
embarrassing position of winning the Edinburgh Touch Rugby League which
it sponsors.
Seventy-six teams are involved in the league, whose matches are played
on Boroughmuir RFC's ground at Meggetland and are part of the Bells
Touch Rugby Tournament.
The DM Hall team have won their first two games, and rumour has it
that their bosses would be happier if they started losing or they might
find themselves on the carpet on Monday being confronted with the
question: ''What do you mean you won again?''
For those readers, like myself, who are not au fait with what touch
rugby is all about, it involves teams of 10 players, six of whom are on
the pitch at the same time.
It seems the players attempt to touch their opponents between the
shoulders and knees instead of tackling in the conventional manner.
Sounds like a game of tig to me.
Jammy party to
mark birthday
WALLACE Mercer is arriving in Scotland this weekend for what will be a
busy time.
Chartered quantity surveyor Eddie Cobb, a long-time Hearts supporter,
invited Wallace and his wife Ann to his 65th birthday party in Gullane
Golf Club on Sunday evening, but he tells me: ''To be honest I think I
was the third reason why Wallace is coming over. I think there is also
the question of a Scottish Cup Final and a silver wedding.''
Around 150 guests will be in Gullane to watch him getting his pension
book and bus pass. But says Cobb, whose firm Cobb McCallum &amp; Co is still
very active, ''I feel more like 29 than 65.''
It must be watching the Jam Tarts that keeps him so fit.
Time to take a
chance on Chile
THE Earl of Dundonald will be among the guest speakers at the Glasgow
Chamber of Commerce evening seminar on business opportunities in Chile
later this month.
The Earl, whose other titles include Honorary Consul for Chile in
Scotland, will be speaking alongside Homero Sotomayor, a commercial
counsellor who will explain Chile's economic situation and the business
opportunities his country can offer Scottish importers and exporters.
Chile has the fastest growing economy in the southern hemisphere but
its trading with the UK has fallen to 2% compared to 50% previously.
The seminar is being run in association with the British Chilean
Chamber of Commerce and will be followed by a question and answer
session. The cost is #21.15, which includes a buffet washed down, we are
told, by some fine Chilean wines. Anyone interested in attending on May
30 from 6pm until 8.30pm should contact John Lyon at Glasgow Chamber of
Commerce on 0141 204 2121.
Saudi mission
comes to town
STILL with Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, a Saudi Arabian trade mission
will be in town on June 12, and the chamber's David Atkings would like
to hear from West of Scotland companies interested in importing goods
from Saudi Arabia.
The mission is being sponsored by British Aerospace and the
Arab-British Chamber of Commerce, and the 40-odd companies participating
offer a wide range of goods from pharmaceuticals to building materials
and food products.
The mission will be based in the Glasgow Hilton. If you are interested
in going along give David Atkings a call on 0141 204 2121.
Hard-headed
view on safety
DR Ian Preston, the new chairman of the Scottish Coal Company, and
Brian Paget, operations manager at Longannet Power Station, were taking
no chances earlier this week when they presented Nicky Wilson, Scottish
secretary of the NUM, with a #7000 cheque.
They both wore hard hats, not because they were frightened Wilson
might thump them over the head because the cheque was not big enough,
but as a precaution in case Edinburgh stilt-walker Michael Angelo made a
slip as he juggled lumps of coal above them.
No-one was saying if any of the hefty lumps, freshly mined from the
Longannet pit, came tumbling down, but Wilson was delighted with the
donation towards the Scottish Miners' Gala which is being held in
Edinburgh on June 10.

If we are to see, and let the rest of the world see, the best that our
theatre is capable of producing, we need a national company which can
give to our best plays the resources they require, argues Paul H Scott
A SCOTTISH National Theatre has been a cherished aspiration for most
of the present century. Our leading dramatists, directors, and actors
have campaigned for it, such people as Tyrone Guthrie, James Bridie,
Duncan Macrae, Robert McLellan, Tom Fleming, Edith Macarthur, Gerda
Stevenson, Bill Bryden, Jector Macmillan, Donald Campbell, Peter Brook,
and Kenny Ireland.
Several times we have been very close to it with the Scottish National
Players, the Glasgow Citizens', the Lyceum and the Gateway in Edinburgh
and, most recently, the Scottish Theatre Company.
In May 1987, a conference was called by the Advisory Council for Arts
in Scotland (AdCAS). This was widely representative of the theatre
community in Scotland and it resolved unanimously that there was a
pressing need for a Scottish National Theatre. It launched a campaign
which still continues.
This campaign has enlisted substantial support, particularly of
Scottish Equity, which represents the acting profession. In 1991, the
Scottish Arts Council (SAC) began a detailed inquiry into the future of
the arts in Scotland. The findings were summarised in a report by Joyce
McMillan, Arts for a New Century, which recognised that: ''The growing
confidence in Scotland's indigenous culture is reflected in a strong
campaign for a Scottish National Theatre.'' In response the SAC set up a
feasibility study by the consultants, Bonnar Keenlyside, of which I
shall say more later. Their report was accepted in principle by the SAC
last December. They announced they would ''now undertake further work to
establish the practicability of a Scottish National Theatre
initiative''.
So far, nothing has been heard of this ''further work'', but clearly
the time for action has arrived after years of discussion and hope.
During the last General Election, campaign arts spokesmen for all four
of the main parties in public meetings in Edinburgh and Glasgow
committed themselves to a Scottish National Theatre. More recently, the
Lord Provosts of both cities have pledged support.
There are many reasons why so many people are anxious to achieve a
national theatre for Scotland. Joyce McMillan referred to one of them in
her report ''the case . . . rests on the contention that it is absurd
for Scotland, which has little indigenous tradition in ballet and opera,
to support major national companies in these areas, while having no
national theatre to protect and express our much richer inheritance of
Scots drama and theatrical tradition''.
This is a very fair point. We are delighted to have Scottish Opera and
Scottish Ballet, but it has to be admitted that there is very little
which is Scottish about them, apart from the geographical location and
the names. This could, and I think should, change. There are, after all,
a few Scottish operas and we have composers capable of writing more.
There are many others which have Scottish affinities such as the great
number derived from the Waverley Novels. The ballet could draw on our
own vigorous dance tradition, as Covent Garden did in Donald of the
Burthens many years ago. Unfortunately, neither company has so far shown
much interest in aspiring to Scottishness now and again. This is a pity
because diversity is better than uniformity and originality better than
imitation.
In drama the position is quite different. During most of the
nineteenth century there was in practice a thriving national theatre,
based mostly on adaptations of Scott's novels. In this century hundreds
of plays have been written, but usually they were given a few
performances and never heard of again. Many of them are well worth
reviving, as the national theatre campaign demonstrated in a very
successful series of readings in the Festival Theatre in Edinburgh last
year. There is also a Scottish style of acting which has very deep roots
in our tradition and still accords perfectly with David Lyndsay's Ane
Satyre of the Thrie Estaites. What we do not have is a company committed
as a principle, but not exclusive, objective to the development of this
repertoire and tradition, both in revivals and in new work. John
Linklater rightly said in an article in this newspaper on August 9,
1993, that the systematic neglect of our heritage of plays is a national
disgrace.
Scottish drama today is very much alive. It would be very easy to draw
up a list of recent productions which delight, illuminate, and linger in
the mind. But this is another reason why we need a national theatre and
not one why we should rest content with what we have. The productions in
our theatres are hampered by severe financial restraint. They can afford
only small casts and short rehearsal time. If we are to see, and let the
rest of the world see, the best that our theatre is capable of
producing, we need a national company which can give to our best plays
the resources they require.
There is another even stronger, if less obvious, reason. It was well
expressed at the AdCAS conference in 1987 by David Daiches, our most
distinguished critic and historian of literature: ''Without a national
theatre the arts tend to fall apart. To focus Scottish literary culture,
to redefine it, to develop its relations with other cultures and to
enable its languages and the literary imagination to be nourished with a
new kind of richness, we need a Scottish National Theatre.''
At the same conference the directors of the national theatres of
Iceland and Finland (suitable models for a small northern country)
agreed with Daiches. Their experience, like that of many other
countries, has shown that a national theatre is a great stimulus to
artistic self-confidence and expression. A theatre directed to the life,
conditions, and ideas mainly of its own country is a powerful aid to the
understanding and enhancement of that society.
As Hamlet told the players, the function of drama is ''to hold, as
t'were, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn
her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and
pressure''.
We can only do this when we hold the mirror to our own face; in other
words, when the plays are mainly directed to our own condition and
experience. Of course, we also want to see plays concerned with other
places and other times, but it is disorienting to see nothing else.
We are familiar with this from our television screens. They are
usually occupied with programmes made elsewhere about other people, but
they suddenly become relevant when we hear a Scottish voice talking
about a Scottish subject. We also have obligations to the rest of the
world. We are contributing nothing, or very little, to the total of
human diversity when we merely imitate others. As John Ramsay of
Ochtertyre said: ''Professed copying ever implies inferiority.''
That is what we are doing when we try to reproduce a production from
Broadway, or Shaftesbury Avenue. If we are to produce work that the rest
of the world will want to see, it has to be distinctive. The intelligent
tourist, too, wants to see something which he is unlikely to see at
home.
We are well provided with major cultural institutions, national
galleries, museums, library, opera, ballet, orchestras, universities,
and so forth. A national theatre is the only component which is missing,
but it is a vital one. Why has it taken so long? In the days before
state sponsorship of the arts, there was little prospect of funding. In
1945 when a Scottish sub-committee of the Arts Council of Great Britain
began to sponsor the arts, little consideration seems to have been given
to the particular conditions of Scotland.
It may have seemed more important to those responsible for policy to
bring to Scotland art forms which hardly existed there at all than to
encourage indigenous creativity. They made little distinction between
art in Scotland and Scottish art. The SAC became an autonomous
organisation responsible to the Scottish Office in April 1994 and for
some time it has been giving more attention to indigenous work, but it
is restricted by financial limitations and established commitments.
Under present conditions the SAC does not have the funds to satisfy
the present clients, let alone new developments. It has even felt
obliged to withdraw the comparatively small amount of revenue funding
from the Brunton Theatre, although it has made an outstanding
contribution to Scottish drama. All the other companies which depend on
SAC funding are naturally anxious about their own future. It is no
surprise that some of their directors resist the idea of a national
theatre because they see it as a threat to their own funding.
For the present at least, money from the Lottery offers very little
help. But the allocations through the SAC and through the Millennium
Commission are restricted to capital expenditure. The trouble is that
for the arts it is not so much new buildings which are needed as funding
for the activities inside them.
Is there a way out of this impasse? I should like to refer again to
the Bonnar Keenlyside report. This suggested three options: a new
touring company or an existing building-based company or a fund to
finance national productions. In fact, these are not really options, but
complementary characteristics, all of which would be required in any
satisfactory solution.
A national theatre would certainly have to tour within Scotland and to
other countries. But it must also have available to it a theatre
building or buildings, for practical purposes, to give it a visible
identity and develop audience loyalty and, above all, so that it can
stage its own productions without having to persuade any other
organisation to accept them. (The lack of their own theatres undermined
both the Scottish National Players and the Scottish Theatre Company.)
Finally funds would certainly be needed to finance work of the scale and
quality that is needed, and this must not be at the expense of the
existing companies.
There is a way in which progress towards the objective could be made
almost immediately. The SAC already help to fund seven building-based
companies. Five of them (Citizens', Dundee, Perth, Pitlochry, Lyceum)
are fairly large theatres with a capacity of about 500 or more. Their
directors, and perhaps some of the other companies as well, could
co-operate on joint national productions which would tour round the
theatres. There have already been tentative moves in this direction.
Such productions would receive special grants to reduce the usual
financial restraints. The group of directors would form the management
of the National Theatre and they would gradually establish a team of
actors specialising in Scottish drama. In this way the national theatre
would evolve, as it should, out of co-operation between the existing
companies and all would benefit in the process.
Where, you might ask, would the money come from? Since these theatres
are already funded, the extra required would be much less than the cost
of forming a new company from scratch. The Scottish Office could be
asked to find it from its budget. The Government spokesman at the second
reading of the National Theatre Act in 1949 said that he hoped Scotland
and Wales would soon follow the English example. Almost 50 years later
the Government should accept an obligation to find the money. Then there
is the Millennium Fund. At a meeting in the Royal Society of Edinburgh
last October the Earl of Dalkeith, the Scottish member of the
commission, held out some hope that exceptions might be made to the
rules about capital expenditure. It would be difficult to think of a
better celebration in Scotland of the new millennium than the adequate
endowment of the national theatre.
At the conclusion of the AdCAS conference in 1987, Tom Fleming said:
''A nation must have a theatre if it is going to have a heart. The
Scottish style of acting is appreciated throughout the world. Do not be
put off by lack of money.
''The will has to be shown, and the rest will happen. There will be a
Scottish National Theatre, but what we have to decide is: Does it happen
when we are all alive? Is it to be in this generation? It will happen
one day. I am sure of that.''
Now is the time to show the will.

* My wife and I are moving to a smaller house as our family have now
grown up and set up on their own. As a result of a recent inheritance
and an endowment policy maturing in the autumn we should be in a
position to purchase a suitable property without having to take out a
mortgage. This would give us peace of mind as I am now in my mid-fifties
and at the age when one fears becoming the target of a redundancy
programme.
However, it has been suggested to me that we should arrange a #30,000
mortgage and invest this amount for our future. What would you advise?
* Ten years ago we would have urged you to take the mortgage and
invest the funds. Your house would have increased in value and your
investments would have risen too. Your debt would have remained the
same, and mortgage interest relief would have eased the burden of
servicing the loan.
The situation is now radically different. House prices are at best
stuck in the doldrums. Inflation is historically low, and investment
returns are only moderate. Mortgage interest relief has been eaten into
by hard-pressed Chancellors seeking to restore order to the public
finances. The tax relief on a mortgage is not even worth #400 a year.
Surpluses on endowment policies are not the prize they once were either,
and it is difficult to think of a walk of life that is free from the
threat of redundancy.
In the circumstances, we think you should follow your own inclination
and, if possible, avoid taking out a mortgage on your new home,
particularly if this will bring you piece of mind.
We would add one proviso, especially if you end up having little or no
money left over for investment. The money you save by not having a
mortgage should be invested in order to build up a nest egg. This way
you may well be able to have the best of all worlds.
* My wife died in October 1994 leaving a will totally in my favour.
The estate included 55,000 shares in an unquoted limited company which
are not readily sold on the open market. I understand the trading value
of the shares is unlikely to increase substantially over the next year.
I would like to gift these shares now to my five children, but if I
did so what capital gains or inheritance tax implications could there
be?
* If you want to gift the shares now to your five children, the
disposal would be liable to capital gains tax. The gain is likely to be
negligible as you would be deemed to have acquired the assets at market
value at the date of your wife's death, and even if there is a taxable
gain, you can elect for holdover relief to apply.
If you were to die within seven years of making the gift there could
potentially be inheritance tax implications, although that would depend
on the extent to which the shares qualified for something known as
business property relief. There are no inheritance tax implications if
you die more than seven years after gifting the shares.
Depending on your wife's other estate, the value of the shares and the
extent to which they qualify for business property relief, you may be
better off gifting them by means of a deed of variation which would
alter the terms of your wife's will. You have two years from the date of
your wife's death to sign such a deed (which must be in writing).
If the appropriate elections are made on time, the effect of such a
variation is that for both capital gains tax and inheritance tax
purposes it is as though the shares were left directly to the children
on your wife's death.
As this could be advantageous or disadvantageous, you need
professional advice about whether this is worthwhile as well as on the
formalities that need to be observed.
* On your finance page on April 29 a reader asked for information
regarding inheritance tax on National Savings. Included with your reply
was the statement that an individual's main residence is exempt from
capital gains tax but on death is part of that person's estate and
potentially liable to inheritance tax.
If a person's residence is left in his will to his wife, is the house
still liable to IHT? If it is and the wife dies shortly afterwards, do
her executors also have to pay IHT? If so, surely the value of the
residence is being taxed twice?
* Fortunately in the circumstances you describe the residence would
not be taxed twice. Even though it forms part of your estate on death,
you can deduct exemptions and relief to which you are entitled to arrive
at the taxable estate.
Assets which are left in your will to your spouse are exempt from tax
(unless your spouse is not domiciled in the UK). The house would be
included in your wife's estate on her subsequent death and inheritance
tax would thus only be paid on the second death.

A phrase that I've heard adults use as long as I can remember is:
''The telly's just rubbish these days'' is a phrase that I've heard
adults use as long as I can remember. The tone in which this is said
might suggest that the programmes' cruddiness is some sort of recent
development. Speaking as one who, as an eight-year-old used to sit
amazed that crap like Animal Magic passed as entertainment, I can vouch
for the fact that we have always had to watch rotten telly programmes.
I know that this is usually a terrible chat-up line, but I sense that
when we're watching TV, my wife doesn't understand me. Like most people
I know, I lose the rag at anything on the box if they're not realistic
in every way. I can stand a bit of improbability, but when people
express amazement at how clean their laundry is, or wax lyrical about
toilet paper, then I can't take it.
Do people actually care how soft toilet paper is? How white can a
T-shirt get? No matter how tolerant you are, that sort of thing is sure
to get your goat, especially when you've got 1200 words to write every
week. My wife, on the other hand, seems unconcerned, refusing to get
uptight about something that's ''only an advert''.
If the adverts annoy, what really makes me blow my top are consumer
programmes or, as they're known in the business, ''tosh''. It all
started with That's Life, a mixture of controlled outrage and double
entendre. Item one, charity fund embezzlement: item two, photo of a sign
in Spain for a Dr Fart: barely suppressed mirthful hysteria: item three,
liver transplant needed for toddler. And so it continued, week after
week for almost 20 years.
Then came Lynne Faulds Wood, Esther Rantzen with a touch of Calvinist
outrage, fronting the Monday Night Mad Neurotics' Half Hour, or Watchdog
as it was known. The problem with consumer programmes is that they're
all made by people arrogant enough to believe that a large part of the
general population needs protecting, and that since religion and science
have both failed, then it's time for journalism to step in. It may be
more accurate to say that everyone is a bit stupid at some time or
another, but whether that's helped by Esther Rantzen meddling, I'm not
too sure.
There are people around who can spend #30 on a hundredweight of pills
that are supposed to make you lose three stones, get you a new job, and
cure world hunger. If, in a moment of weakness, you succumb and pay the
wad you don't want the whole country knowing about it. Letting the whole
country know about it is not the best thing. If you end up being forced
into buying a timeshare in Cumbernauld, a quiet promise to yourself
never to be so stupid again will make you much better than a month's
worth of some journalist's phoney sympathy. The programmes don't do
themselves any favours when they concentrate on cases that are dead
losses from the kick-off.
What next? Revelations that those Bazooka Joe X-ray Specs won't really
let you see women's underwear! Shock! . . . Usually they make you laugh,
with items about self-evident dangers. Mr Brown of Rugby bought himself
a new kitchen knife. No-one had warned him that it was a sharp cutting
implement. You can just imagine how surprised he was on picking it up,
he cut his finger. We spoke to the man who sold him the knife, a Mr . .
. etc, etc.''
On Monday night I saw the second programme where Watchdog has mutated
into Watchdog Health Check. Monday night's episode was a classic example
of the consumer programme genre (Genre: French, meaning ponce.) It
started with an item about mothers who had noticed that their children
were not too good at things like tying shoelaces or tidying their rooms.
Being middle class, and with nothing else to worry about, they
couldn't accept that their child was not exactly like everybody else's.
So they dragged the kids to the doctors' who were of the opinion that
the child was just ''clumsy'' or ''a bit unco-ordinated''. Of course,
being ''concerned'' parents (Concerned. Old Latin word meaning
''interfering''), they couldn't accept this. These otherwise normal
children were taken round a string of doctors, continually denying the
diagnosis of mere ''clumsiness''. Eventually some highly paid expert
specialist gave them a ''proper'' label of ''dyspraxia''. (Dyspraxia.
Greek: meaning ''Clumsy brat with overbearing mother''.)
This expert came up with the brilliantly simple, simply brilliant plan
that if the child was bad at tying shoelaces, then another therapist
with special counselling skills should help them . . . by teaching them
to tie shoelaces! If the child was, for instance, bad at writing, then
-- and what a mind this bloke must have -- they should use a word
processor! Doesn't it make you glad that we have these experts to help
us through life?
I'm an expert in this, I was about eight when I learned to tie my
laces, approximately four decades after the rest of my class. They were
all doing advanced Origami, making working models of swans and the City
Chambers, and I still couldn't tie a bow. I thought I was just clumsy,
and here all this time I've had something Greek. I've been cheated.
Maybe I should sue.
The next item on WHC was even funnier. Apparently there have been 30
cases where members of the public turn up to accidents posing as
paramedics. Thirty cases! These guys will turn up in an old Ford Escort,
and put in drips and reassure the punters.
This solves a mystery. There must be a huge gang of guys who hang
around my area posing as plumbers, roofers, and video repairmen. None
had any training, experience, or even skill, but it didn't matter. You
don't have to train for years to learn how to remove digestive biscuits
from a video. Even worse, I saw some people posing as presenters on a
medical information programme when they quite clearly had little or no
knowledge of what was going on. I think we shouldn't be told.
* THE Scottish Cup Final is upon us today, as usual it gives every
true football fan something to celebrate, usually that Hearts aren't
anywhere in the final. While a minority of the population try to kid us
all into believing that the Rugby World Cup is of any interest, the true
sports fan can settle down this afternoon with a few beers hoping to see
what all football fans want. Goals. And a good fight. And some more
beer. Never mind your play-up nonsense, this is the thrill of the cup
manoes a manoes and, just to sauce it up, Celtic are in the final so
there's a nice wee bit of bigotry in there too.
The male (and a large part of the female) audience will be glued to
the screen. Having watched the English with their watered-down version
of the season's climax (Liverpool against Manchester, where's the
religion in that?) . . . Hold on, you'll have to excuse me . . .

* I am a 70-year-old non-taxpaying housewife with modest holdings in
the following companies: Standard Life Management Trust, Murray Income,
BT, British Gas, ICI, Devro, 3i, ScottishPower and Cable &amp; Wireless
amounting to #22,000 in total. I have a 10% interest matured N&amp;P bond,
of which I would like to re-invest #5000 for a similar return.
A friend suggested a long-dated gilt through the National Savings
Register giving the same return and letting my heirs worry about the
redemption. Alternatively, in view of the rumour with the takeover or
break-up of Cable &amp; Wireless, I thought about some Cable &amp; Wireless 7%
convertible loan stock 2008.
* Getting 10% with security will be difficult if not impossible
nowadays. Some corporate bond unit trusts may approach this but they are
not without risk. As regards the gilt suggestion, Exchequer 12% 2013-17
has a running yield of almost 9% until 2013 at the earliest, though any
rise in interest rates would leave you with a capital loss should you
sell it. If held to maturity there would be a capital loss of 25%.
If you are not concerned for your heirs, you could consider building
society permanent interest bearing shares which can yield double
figures.
The Cable &amp; Wireless convertible would be a less risky way to take a
punt on takeover activity than buying the Ordinary shares, though it is
a dead loss for income as it yields only 3.5%. There certainly have been
rumours of interest in Cable &amp; Wireless, but whether a bid will actually
arrive is anyone's guess. However, the company is a sound long-term
investment in any case.
* On November 1 I commenced a Rainbow Mortgage Endowment Plan with
Eagle Star Life Assurance Company. With an initial premium of #83 per
month and 20% increase per annum my total investment to date is #4579.
On making enquiries by telephone I was shocked to be informed that the
total present value of the policy was a mere #667.54.
If the figure quoted is accurate, in you're opinion could the charges
involved be described as excessive or standard, and would I be advised
to change from the present policy over to a personal equity plan or
could things hopefully only get better?
* Surrender terms in the early years of an endowment policy are
notoriously low, though they do vary from company to company. We presume
this is what you have been quoted. However, Eagle Star itself says that
the figure does seem unduly low on the basis of the figures given.
Therefore, we would suggest you re-approach the company for a fresh
appraisal. The place to enquire is Customer Client Services (Life),
Cheltenham, telephone 01242 221311.
As to whether you should switch, this would mean a substantial loss of
capital even if the figure you quote is inaccurate. You should hold your
endowment as long as possible, and you should find that the position
will indeed improve noticeably over time.
* Some seven years ago my company entered into a personal pension plan
with London &amp; Manchester (Pensions) Ltd. It decided some two-and-a-half
years ago to change to another company owing to poorish performance.
However, it was decided to keep any accumulated funds with the London &amp;
Manchester.
I was advised that the value of the fund at January 1, 1995 was
#20,500, which compares with #22,000 on January 1, 1994. This means that
in the course of 12 months my plan has diminished by some #1500, which
is a bit of a blow, as I am dependent on such a plan to provide a
pension.
Do you consider that such a decrease against a balanced fund is
acceptable, taking into account the vagaries of the stock market?
* The decline in value of your fund over the 12 month period is, of
course, unfortunate. But share markets in general did show a 10.5% fall
over the period as measured by the FTSE-100 share index, so it looks as
if the fund has followed the market, which is not really surprising as
it is just an accumulated fund and not being managed on a hands on
basis.
It should be some consolation, though, that since the beginning of
this year the market, again as measured by the FTSE-100 share index, has
risen around 9%, so much of the lost ground should have been made up.

ROBIN Angus of NatWest Securities is clearly a man who likes to look
ahead. Naturally he does, he would not be one of the gurus of the
investment trust world if he didn't. So it is not surprising to find
that as we have to have a General Election some time in the next two
years, he has been pondering the political scene and the problems the
approach of the poll could potentially bring for investors.
The good news is that there is, in his opinion, a situation out there
which should work out at ''heads I win, tails I don't lose''. To find
this satisfactory arrangement of chances you look among the investment
trusts specialising in overseas shares.
But first we need to know why we should be thinking overseas at a time
when the UK market is doing well. Mr Angus does not, of course, say ''do
it now''. He simply sets out the case for making adjustments some time
before election worries start upsetting things.
Noting that most people expect Labour to win the election, he goes on:
''They may be wrong. But if they are right it will tend to be seen as
being bad news for the UK financial markets. And even if Labour merely
seems likely to win it could be bad news too.''
Mr Angus is clearly unimpressed by the ''bunch of clowns'' currently
in power, but he points out: ''Few overseas observers expect Labour to
be as disciplined about inflation as the Conservatives are. This
suggests that at some time during the next two years foreigners will
lose confidence in sterling, interest rates will rise, gilts will fall,
and UK equities will be dragged down along with them.''
For good measure he also sees a risk that PEPs might be stopped or
altered in some unfavourable way by a Labour Government.
Not everyone will agree with his assessment for the stock market, as
there is a school of thought which argues that share prices often rise
under Labour. That might be because inflation rises and share prices
eventually adjust to that. It seems worth bearing in mind when
considering the possibility of inflation that Labour leaders, along with
their policy of seldom saying anything which might be mistaken for a
statement of policy, have carefully avoided promising to make the Bank
of England independent.
To be fair, Tony Blair this week set out to win over the doubters with
a strong emphasis on low inflation and fiscal prudence, but we still
have to see how ingrained the suspicion is.
Mr Angus' advice is: ''Prudent UK investors will be likely to be
looking overseas if only as a 'safe haven' or as a hedging of their
bets.''
Investment trusts are ''the classic way of diversifying overseas for
UK-based equity investors''. Within that sector he highlights in
particular the ''general overseas'' specialists -- such as Dunedin
Worldwide, Fleming Overseas and Kleinwort Overseas -- and the ''Far East
including Japan'' specialists -- such as Fleming Far East, Foreign and
Colonial Pacific, Govett Oriental and Martin Currie Pacific. All these
''offer a very high degree of overseas market and currency exposure''.
These trusts are ''reassuringly'' selling at discounts, he adds.
All this is the ''heads I win'' side of the argument. The ''tails I
don't lose'' bit comes in when you consider the precedent set by the
splitting of Drayton Far Eastern into two trusts, one concentrating on
Asia and the other on Japan. The decision to split followed pressure
from a large institutional shareholder which originally wanted the trust
split into two OEICs, the new Continental style Open-Ended Investment
Companies which look very much like unit trusts in that they have the
attraction of being dealt in at asset value.
This gives the ''double fall-back'' of focus sharpening and conversion
into OEICs if discounts persist.
Mr Angus makes it clear that he is ''very far from saying that they
are all shortly going to be restructured along the lines of Drayton Far
Eastern or that their boards are planning to convert them into OEICs.
But I do nevertheless believe that the investment case is a compelling
one.
''These stocks in any event offer good value. If Labour gets in, or
looks likely to get in as the General Election nears, they are stocks
one would want one's portfolio to be heavily weighted towards.''
If they failed to perform or carried on selling at significant
discounts for a lengthy period, shareholders would have ''two insurance
policies -- restructuring in order to enhance value, which now has a
clear precendent, and the possibility of becoming an OEIC which did not
exist before''. On that basis he says: ''They are worth a look.''
The point about OEICs is of interest across the whole investment trust
sector, particularly where trusts have little or no borrowing. Mr Angus,
in his Corporate Activity Review for the year so far, notes sadly: ''No
new gearing worth speaking of has been raised.''
He sums up that OEICs may in the future ''provide a way of ensuring
the continuance of worthwhile trusts which do not make much use of what
trusts can do but OEICs cannot and which have tended to sell at
discounts which shareholders find irritating''.
On a different tack but still looking overseas, Credit Lyonnais Laing
notes that a sense of optimism has returned to emerging markets and
premium ratings have started to re-appear for trusts specialising in
these exciting but risky areas. In its latest review of emerging markets
trusts its brokers throw the spotlight on Old Mutual South Africa Trust,
a focus trust launched just under a year ago. You have to make up your
mind about how risky South Africa may be, but there is little doubt that
it is rich and full of potential.
The trust is managed by Old Mutual, the country's oldest life
assurance firm and aims to find capital growth from investing in mainly
South African companies. It has almost half its assets in medium and
small companies and its asset value has out-performed the Johannesburg
Stock Exchange index although its shares trade at a sizeable discount.

PLAYING the lottery is almost certainly going to be a case of hope
triumphing over experience. According to the odds, for the one person
who wins the jackpot, 14 million people will lose their stake.
And the experience of most punters is that it tends to be an
expensive, unrewarding one.
The most likely winners are the lottery organisers, and the inventors
of the new rash of electronic prediction tools, whether computers or
books.
Serious gamblers who like to use systems reckon that the odds of
guessing the six balls that will tumble from a crudely mechanical wheel
are far too long to be interesting.
According to Camelot, the chances of winning the jackpot (the six main
numbers) which carry an expected win or share of #2m or more, are one in
13,983,816; five main numbers plus the bonus number (#100,000) -- one in
2,330,636; five numbers (#1500) -- one in 55,492; four numbers (#65) --
one in 1033; and the three main numbers (#10) -- one in 57.
Camelot claims that the overall odds of winning a prize are one in 54.
It is more difficult to produce statistical odds for the football
pools, as they depend upon the games played. Dr Barry Blight, a
statistics expert at the London School of Economics, was asked by
Littlewoods to make an objective comparison of the chances of winning
the lottery with the chances of winning on Littlewoods pools.
''My results are solely based on the chances of winning over #1m for a
#1 bet,'' said Dr Blight. ''For the National Lottery this is about one
in 15 million. For Littlewoods pools, the chances of winning over a
million are one in six million, and so for this particular comparison,
the pools are far better.''
To take the number-crunching a step further, there is also Ernie, the
churner-out of premium bond winnings, to consider.
The monthly chances of Ernie dishing out #1m on a #1 stake are one in
4.93bn.
The odds given for the chances of winning the first Instants game
were:
Prize................number of prizes..............odds (one in:)
#1......................30,240,000..................10...........
#2......................15,120,000..................20...........
#5.......................5,292,000..................57...........
#10......................3,024,000..................100..........
#20......................1,512,000..................200..........

#200........................25,200..................12,000.......
#1000..........................630..................480,000......
#50,000........................126..................2,400,000....
Statistically speaking, with a #1 holding in Premium Bonds, the
chances of winning are as follows:
Prize................Number of prizes in May 1995.....Odds
#1,000,000.......................1...................1 in 4.93bn
#100,000.........................2...................1 in 2.47bn

YOU may be wondering why I am wearing a purple Crimplene pelmet, mat
black nail varnish with bullseye motif and tie-dye knickers. Oh you
noticed? Good. It's my mourning gear.
You will perhaps be aware that I rarely intrude my personal life into
this public column (the death of the goldfish and the Aga saga being
diversionary blips). This is because my personal life is of an
ordinariness so excruciating that if I were to go on about it all Herald
readers would immediately hurry off for light entertainment to the Times
Literary Supplement.
Anyhow, rules were made to be broken, especially those self-imposed in
a spirit of professional improvement and in the panic-stricken face of a
looming deadline.
So, since everyone else is at it, doing the Hippy Hippy Shake on
Harold's coffin, I thought I'd sling in my sixpence worth (you remember
the tanner: small but satisfyingly round coin with which, in 1966, you
could purchase the entire contents of Woolie's cosmetic counter and
still have something left with which to buy a copy of Fab 208).
I am a sixties child. There it's said.
The wisdom of hindsight is indeed a wondrous thing. After years of
enforced penance, when all through the eighties the demonology of the
prevailing political counter-culture blamed our poor benighted decade
for every moral and social evil, from single mothers to hipsters,
toe-jobbing politicians to Herman's Hermits, we learned to hang our
heads.
Like all dissidents, it was easier to dissimulate than own up to
politically incorrect values such as social decency, political
integrity, and old-fashioned tolerance.
We, the first graduates of comprehensive education, can come out now
to confess that, yes, those dangerous radical educational ideologues who
inhabited Portobello school, such as Miss Crawford and Mr Trotter, did
indeed manage to inculcate us with the revolutionary notion that we
could give up tugging forelocks, be whatever our abilities allowed us to
be, get a job and, what's more, decline Latin verbs in joined-up
writing.
So shake out the Parkas, polish up the bells, find a needle for the
Dansette: for like all those forced to recant that which they secretly
cherish, such as Vespas, common decency, bell-bottoms, political
probity, and Cathy McGowan's fringe, we are in for a mass outbreak of
hope, Wilsonian revisionism, and a celebration of the cultural
revolution of the sixties.
In the City, sod-the-rest credentials and red braces will be tossed
aside in favour of integrity and collarless suits cut tight at the
crotch. Sapped teachers and staff nurses spotted at night crying on the
top decks of buses and at railway stations where no trains run will be
met by a beatific Virginia Bottomley and Gillian Shephard in hotpants,
handing out gardenias and a 10% pay rise. Oh, all right, maybe that's
taking hope too far, but you catch the incensed drift.
As Harold never said: where two or three are gathered together in my
name . . . and all week, sixties children have been gathering to
reminisce, eyes moistly gleaming (like Sarah), to recall fondly how he
stood on her toe at a rally; of how Gannex's (Frances, aglow) were de
rigueur on university campuses: showing off faint but proud battle scars
(Dave) where a police horse trod on a sandal-shod foot during an
anti-Vietnam demo in Grosvenor Square.
Harold Wilson was, after all, the last Prime Minister we had a good
time under and it's my firm belief that he invented the political
''Feel-good Factor'', that elusive metaphysical sense of wellbeing and
security that springs from political decency.
This of course assumes that at the moment the British public don't
feel good.  I'm not sure this is the case.  For, as I look around me, I
see more and more faint traces of a smile on people's faces.  It is not
one, yet, of financial security or social wellbeing. Nor is it because
they have relearned the forgotten skills of rolling Rizla paper.
It is stimulated by a growing sense of certainty among us that in two
years' time the whole damn load of clammy, cheating, utility-whoring,
supergun smuggling, toe-jobbing incompetents who've been slabbering
around the corridors of power for the past 16 years will be really,
actually, and objectively out on their bahookies. And it makes me feel
good just to say it. So thanks Harold. Your living has not been in vain.

UNIT trusts are dead -- long live unit trusts. That's the message
emerging from the unit trust industry as it faces up to a large-scale
modernisation programme.
Unit trusts have been around for 30 years or so and manage the best
part of #100bn on behalf of investors. They struggled to attract funds
in the late eighties against a background of soaring interest rates, but
have been given a new lease of life recently by PEPs (personal equity
plans) which boosted sales to record levels over the last couple of
years.
Sales of unit trusts are set to boom again this summer when the new
style corporate bond PEPs go on sale. With a potential market estimated
at some #27bn, corporate bond PEPs are poised to become a hugely
important part of the investment scene.
But, despite the massive opportunities ahead, unit trusts may not have
long to survive in their present form. Plans for a shake-up of the
industry have already been unveiled by the Government and a detailed
report on new regulations and charges is expected soon from the
Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the main watchdog of the
financial services industry.
The SIB regulations will be the key that unlocks the way forward for
the unit trust industry. By the end of this year half of the money now
invested in units could be heading for the new Open-Ended Investment
Companies, or OEICs as they've been dubbed.
A change of name is certainly on the cards -- after all, who would be
happy for their hard-earned cash to be associated with something that
sounds like a brainless hooligan -- but the suggested alternative of
Investment Funds is likely to be fiercely resisted by the investment
trust industry.
Finding a suitable name could be the least of the unit trust
industry's problems. Trying to explain the development to unit holders
-- and, in most cases, securing their agreement to changes -- is going
to be a much bigger challenge.
''OEICs will be very similar in purpose to unit trusts, but different
in structure,'' says David Graham, head of marketing at Scottish Widows.
''The main difference UK investors will notice is that the old dual
pricing system for unit trusts will be replaced by a single price at
which you both buy and sell. If there are any charges for buying and
selling these will be quoted separately.
''The move from the old and sometimes confusing system of bid and
offer prices for unit trusts to a single pricing system will be much
simpler and clearer for investors to understand.''
The end of the ''spread'' between these prices could bring real cost
savings for investors. At the moment an investment in a unit trust
typically needs to grow by 6% to 7% before you can sell your units for
the same price as you bought them. That's because, on any given day,
there's a difference between the cost of buying -- the offer price --
and what you get if you're selling -- the bid figure.
Under single pricing the same one is quoted whether you're buying or
selling. There are likely to be dealing charges too, but these could
make much less of an impact on the value of your investment than the old
dual pricing system.
More information about unit trust charges and the effect they can have
on your investment over time should be available later this year, when
unit trusts will have to disclose information in the same sort of format
as life insurance and pension policies.
If OEICs are going to be pretty much the same as unit trusts, what is
the point of them replacing an investment which has worked well enough
for three decades? Well, while investors in the UK are quite happy with
the way unit trusts are structured, overseas investors are not -- and
the UK unit trust industry cannot afford to be left behind as the market
for personal investment expands worldwide.
The new funds will have all the old features of unit trusts which have
stood the industry in good stead -- they will be easy to buy and sell,
with daily pricing and investor protection -- but they will be able to
adapt quickly and more easily to attract overseas investors too.
In fact, a version of OEICs is already sold in the UK. These offshore
funds work very much like unit trusts, but are registered outside the UK
so they do not have the same level of investor protection.
By allowing OEICs to be based onshore, investors will benefit from the
safeguards already available to unit trust holders. The assets of unit
trusts are looked after by a separate trustee, for instance. This is
crucial for safety if the trust managers get into trouble, as the
Barings debacle highlighted.
If a unit trust converts to an OEIC, the name of the trustee is likely
to be changed to a depository, but the general principle of securing
assets remains the same and there may also be independent directors
overseeing the activities of the manager.
''From a private investor's point of view there will be no difference
in the purpose or function of the two products,'' says Philip Warland of
the Unit Trust Association. ''But the changes mean the industry will be
able to devise products that are better attuned to customer needs both
internationally and in the UK.
''The key criteria against which we assess the proposals is whether
they bring the same level of investor protection as unit trusts,'' he
adds.

FRIENDLY societies get a lot of street cred for being tax free, but is
this historical freedom really the benefit it is cracked up to be?
Friendly societies are given tax-free status because the Government
restricts the size of their savings plans.
From the beginning of May these investment limits have been raised
from #200 to #270 a year and from #18 to #25 a month. But these remain
very modest amounts, and collecting small savings is a costly business,
especially if many of your plans are sold by commission-hungry financial
advisers.
Friendly societies don't offer tax relief on the money going into
their plans but your savings do grow in a tax-free fund and there is no
tax to pay when you cash in your plan so long as you keep it going for
10 years.
Homeowners Friendly Society, one of the largest, has recently cut its
charges. Even so, if you save the maximum of #25 a month you still stand
to lose 45% of your first year's premium in charges. If you can only
afford to save #10 a month, you lose a massive 60% of the first year's
premium. Couples get a discount if they both take out a plan, but the
least you can lose is 35% of the first year's premium if you both take
one for #25 a month.
Homeowners Friendly Society imposes other charges too. These include a
50p a month administration fee and fund charges amounting to 1% a year
with a spread of 5% between the buying and selling price of units in the
investment fund.
The other big disadvantage of a friendly society savings plan is that
you are committed to save for at least 10 years. You can cash in the
plan earlier but the surrender value will be low in the early years and
you are unlikely to get your money back.
Most small savers do better saving regularly with their bank or
building society. Anyone who likes the idea of enforced savings can do
it by standing order -- banks and building societies are only too happy
to accept regular monthly savings in this way. And if you don't mind
locking your money up for five years, try a tax-free TESSA instead.
These are bank and building society deposit accounts and, if you cash in
early, all you lose is your tax relief.
If you want to be more adventurous, the best option is a monthly
savings scheme into a unit trust or an investment trust. The charges on
these are relatively modest when compared with friendly societies. Unit
trusts and investment trusts invest on the stock market and the value of
the units can go up and down, although in the long term, if you can keep
your investment going for at least seven years, you should do better
than leaving your money in the bank or building society. There are still
plenty of fund managers who will accept small regular investments of #25
a month.
Most friendly society savings schemes are linked to stock market funds
which work in a very similar way to unit trusts and investment trusts.
You can check the performance of these funds in Money Management, the
monthly investment magazine produced by the Financial Times which is
sold in larger newsagents.
Some, like the Tunbridge Wells Equitable Friendly Society, still offer
the traditional with-profits endowment policy, with bonuses each year
and a final bonus added when the plan matures.
The Tunbridge Wells is one of few friendly societies where freedom
from tax is reflected in performance. Its policies regularly appear
among top performing endowments. It has also got round the friendly
society savings limits by running non tax-exempt funds alongside the
tax-free ones. For example, someone wanting to invest #50 a month will
have #25 invested tax free with the other #25 taxed like any other life
insurance fund.
A recent survey in Money Management shows that at #50 a month, the
Tunbridge Wells achieves lower than average charges. The average
reduction in yield -- the amount by which the fund must grow each year
to recoup the charges -- for a 10-year endowment policy is 3.31%,
compared with 3% for the Tunbridge Wells. But this is still a lot of
money to lose and, of course, there is no guarantee it can continue its
excellent investment performance.

Allan Laing meets an actress acclaimed for dying on screen, and doing
so with incomparable style
SYLVIA Syms, seductive screen siren of the fifties and sixties,
explaining her latest film role, declares: ''It's all about how you end
your life. You are an old woman, an independent spirit, and you know
that you are dying; and you approach it in a very unsentimental way
because you have decisions to make.''
It seems at first curious to cast Syms as, not only an old woman, but
an old woman approaching her final days. For although she may be 60, she
is far removed from old. Perhaps her secret lies in the fact that she is
an actress who has had the good grace -- and common sense -- to age
well.
Her beauty remains, shining through in the flesh without the dubious
benefit of soft-focus cameras, heavy-duty cosmetics, or the plastic
surgeon's scalpel. She looks her age -- and that is as it should be.
With her there is no youthful sad pretence.
Still, she does die with style. In ITV's Peak Practice, as Beth's
lifelong friend and soulmate Isabel de Gines, she popped her clogs
beautifully. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. There was an elegance
in her death. It became her.
Now she is dying again, in Glasgow, for Dancing -- one of this year's
BBC Scotland/Scottish Film Production Fund Tartan Shorts. In this
tender, touching story, written and directed by Steven Rimkus and
produced by Pamela Wilson, she plays Rose, a woman who has lived a rich
and full life, but who is now approaching its end, alone.
Sylvia Syms once said she wished she had known she was beautiful when
she was beautiful. Noel Coward knew she was beautiful. In her first West
End stage role in 1953 (in Shaw's The Apple Cart) she had a small part
opposite the great man. He took her out to lunch in the Savoy because,
it is reputed, he liked the hat she wore. It was, she recalls, the first
posh restaurant she'd ever been to.
But beauty was not all there was to Sylvia Syms; and today it is not
all there is. There was -- is -- also genuine acting talent and
intelligence. She quickly made the transition to feature films.
With performances in movies like Ice Cold In Alex, Woman In A Dressing
Gown and (alongside Cliff Richard) in Espresso Bongo, she firmly
established herself as one of the leading actresses of her generation.
She was a classic English rose in that vast vase of British talent.
''You know,'' she says, laughing at some secret knowledge which she is
about to share with you, ''I got #30 a week for Ice Cold In Alex! #30 a
week! My stand-in got paid more than I did. In fact, I got a great deal
more money when they used a clip from the film for a Carlsberg advert on
television recently.''
In recent years, she has carved herself a career as a distinguished
character actress in British television. Two performances stand out
above the rest. One was in the aforementioned Peak Practice which, she
candidly admits, ''earned me some loot and then it came to an end''. The
other was her convincing portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in Thatcher --
The Final Days.
She says: ''You know one of the things which a lot of people resent is
the fact that there don't seem to be too many acting parts for people
between the ages of 45 and 60. But there are plenty for people who are
older or younger, and yet where would the country be without us? The
place would fall apart. That's the age when people run the country. Look
at social services, at charities, at hospitals . . . it's all people
between 45 and 60.''
Sylvia Syms is a woman who, on the strength of her British film
success, could have found even greater success in Hollywood. But she
eschewed the idea of Tinseltown, preferring instead to remain here with
her family (she married and had children at a young age).
In a showbiz world where personal relationships are often so
transient, her's was a most durable marriage. She and her husband Alan
Edney, who had met each other when she was only 15, remained married for
33 years. Then came the bombshell. Five years ago she discovered that
Alan had fathered a child to another woman. Though he wanted the
marriage to survive, she decided to divorce him.
''When that happened, after more than 30 years, it was obviously
dramatic. It was like finding a second life. I was on my own and
responsible for myself; having to make my own decisions.
''Now I'd find it very difficult to marry again. And yet I am still
ever so loyal to Alan. Bitter but loyal. We might have gone on if I had
not been forced into making a painful decision. But once forced into it
I moved with speed. We still speak on the telephone. We both love the
children,'' she says.
With that, she brings the conversation about her marriage to an end
and returns to happier thoughts. Dancing, which is why she is in
Glasgow, after all.
''The great thing about this film is the fact that it is young film
makers who are involved. The fact that it is Scottish is, well, just a
fact. I don't consider nationalistic boundaries; all I know is that it
is a wonderful story with wonderful characters.
''Rose is a woman of enormous intellect and energy who has travelled
greatly and had a career. But now she is nearing the end and wants to
control what happens to her,'' she explains.
Sylvia Syms is clearly a champion of the younger generation. It
worries her greatly, she says, that young student actors find it so
difficult these days to obtain financial grants and find openings in the
theatre and television.
''It is such a wasteful industry and lots of young people will fail
but there will be some who succeed. We don't have the training schemes
we used to have in television. We are not allowing the next generation
of actors to develop properly,'' she says.
* Dancing will be premiered, along with its companion Tartan Shorts,
during the Edinburgh International Film Festival in August. Sylvia Syms
can be seen in the 1958 film Ice Cold in Alex on Channel 4 on Monday
evening at 6.35pm.

ON Speaking Out (BBC Radio Scotland) this Thursday a listener phoned
in to describe how she, in full knowledge of the risks, had had
unprotected sex. Her fear of rejection had been stronger than her
resolve when she had suggested condoms and she had been, in that
respect, dismissed. The woman was dismayed at herself for the
irrationality of her behaviour, and she articulately offered her
confusion for discussion.
Knowledge of the facts had been no help, so the speakers, rightly,
instead of being uselessly judgmental, wondered aloud with Ruth Wishart
(and for us all) what strategies, cultural, educative, helpful, could
assist when such a combination of desire and insecurity could lead to a
potentially terrible consequence.
Karen Clark, in The Slice later that morning, was asking who had been
told what about sexuality when little: was it the book left around
discreetly by the embarrassed parent, the lurid playground-learnt
inaccuracies, the biology-class diagram -- the stuff of hilarious
hindsight anecdotes, if you were lucky, part of life-damaging ignorance
if you were not. Our teenage pregnancy figures are no giggle at all: in
the West the States earn the largest number of notches there, followed
by England, then Scotland. Being too puritan-protective of information
leads not to self control but the arbitrary unfairness of chance: lust a
lottery instead of being part of informed growing up.
So then to the wish that bishops could be informed and grown up:
keeping to their laudable ecumenical hopes, railing politely against
prejudice, and not embarrassing the intellect and the groin with their
latest thoughts on sin, science, and liberalism.
Richard Holloway, discussed in both programmes, set himself up with
his nonsense recently about ''promiscuous genes'', and all his pompous
huffiness about the tabloid response was irrelevant. To be so muddied in
his thinking to attribute the complexity of sexual behaviour to a
past-sin determinism brought about by badly understood scientific
knowledge is as dangerous as those inquisitions from which he would
distance his liberal soul. From considering his sermon on the
genetically mounted to listening to an essay on eugenics by Professor
Sheila Maclean was a blessing. (Future Perfect, BBC Radio Scotland).
To manage, in 30 minutes, such an economic summation of the grim
ironies in the history of genetic science was impressive indeed. Our
bodies are carriers of blood groups, of cystic fibrosis, of traits that
make for family resemblance; but when grotesquely oversimplified, the
eugenic facts can be distorted to terrifying ends.
SIDNEY WEBB was terribly worried that while people of his sort were
using birth control to limit their families, ''denizens of the one-room
tenements'' were breeding away. The Irish Catholics and the Jews (he was
quite specific) were proliferating, and he warned of a national
deterioration that needed halting.
The Nazis, hell bent in their goal for racial purity, held meetings
where the scientists, with their Phds and bogus rationality, argued for
the euthanasia of the mentally ill. As the programme illustrated, human
genetics has an outrageous and disastrous past.
And meanwhile, back at home, Churchill and Bernard Shaw, those figures
we are meant to venerate, freedom fighters of culture and state, were
pretty impressed by the body fascism of enforced sterilisation.
Last week a radio producer in Mike Lloyd's Usual Suspects talked of
radio as being ''dreaming travail''. Terry Waite bore witness to that in
Private Passions (R3) in which he described the joy of being allowed a
transistor after four years of solitary confinement. He balanced it on
the metal bar which attached the chain to his leg -- and he listened to
Elgar.

Theatre
PREVIOUS productions of Strindberg's bemusing, confusing
dream-inspired narrative have either emphasised the spectacular elements
of this fantastical play, peopled by over 45 characters, or opted for a
tightly-focused studio theatre approach -- as Ingmar Bergman did in 1970
with Dramaten, the Royal Dramatic Theatre of Sweden, and the Traverse
did in '74, using only nine actors. Intriguingly, and with astounding
success, Robert Lepage incorporates both interpretations into one
vision, directing Dramaten in an exquisite piece of theatre.
He paints with broad strokes but exquisite detail; bold effects
combined with the subtlest, critically effective, observations. Sound
seems to boom out from every crevice of the Tramway and the lighting
effects are overwhelmingly breathtaking, but the action is meticulously
staged within the cramped confines of a suspended 3m-wide cube. This
strange stage spins on its axis, transformed by that stunning lighting
design from scene to scene, as Agnes, the daughter of the Indian god
Indra, descends to earth and traverses the globe exploring human
frailities
Lepage's experiential style is uniquely appropriate to Indra's quest;
as she engages directly in the pains and pleasures of human interaction
we too are absorbed into the various dramas which form the surreal
string of encounters. That this is so is a tribute to Lepage's skill and
the company's talent; the technological illusions are never allowed to
overpower the intensity of the drama.
The stagecraft facilitates Strindberg's stream of consciousness
narrative, with fluid links between contrasting scenes -- one erotically
charged, blood-red, sexual depiction segues seamlessly into drab
domestic misery -- which yet have strong individual resonances, with
stolid performances from the 16-strong cast, Francesca Quartey playing
Agnes with luminous grace.

OVER the years, opera, pantomime, Disney's cartoon, classical ballet
have all dipped into the pages of Cinderella, briskly extracted what
they needed -- and just as promptly altered what they wanted. For their
version, Cwmni Ballet Gwent have sided with folklore and the Brothers
Grimm: here the power that sends Cinders to the ball isn't fairy
hocus-pocus, but Christian faith and the guardian love of a dead mother.
The first thing you see when the curtain rises is a thoroughly
cherubic angel sitting amid the ashes . . . Cinderella herself is
kneeling, lost in prayer. Female vanity, malice and cruelty arrive in
the unholy trinity of the stepmother and the sisters -- a trio given an
interesting twist by having one sister danced by a man. Craig Brown does
this with spritely mischief and a welcome lack of grotesque
exaggeration.
More surprises lie in the choice of music: Vivaldi. This is probably
most effective when the solemn grandeur of a chorale swells under
Cinderella's moments of pious devotion, or when Darius James has his
small ensemble assume the courtly gestures and neat steps of period
dance. But there is scant romance surging around in Vivaldi and this
tends to dry and deny the poignancy of Cinders's first encounter with
the Prince.
True, he sweeps her off her feet -- many times, and with spectacular
lifts . . . but it's dramatic, rather than tender. Despite my
reservations about the music there are some fine, imaginative elements
in the staging and some very attractive performances.
This is a small company of real integrity, the standard of dancing is
very sound throughout and the quality of characterisation is often
admirable. Glenrothes has the chance to see for themselves how spirited
and enterprising this company is; they are at Rothes Hall tonight.

WITH the spring migrant season still in full flow, the Shetland Isles
and the Ythan Estuary remain the best places to see rare bird species.
This week's highlights include, Lesser White Fronted Goose, Stone
Curlew, Spoonbill, Black-Browed Albatross, Forsters Tern, reports of a
Red Footed Falcon and several reports of Marsh Harriers throughout the
regions.
Reports are listed in their approximate order of rarity or interest of
the species, giving dates seen. Unfortunately no guarantees can be given
that the birds will still be present at this time.
REGIONAL REPORTS
Shetland -- On Fair Isle rarities included a Stone Curlew (14th) along
with a Turtle Dove, Nightingale, Bluethroat and several Shore Larks
(14th). On Shetland the Black-Browed Albatross was still present along
with two drake King Eiders (18th) and a White Billed Diver (14th). There
were also sightings of up to 30 Pomarine Skuas and five Long Tailed
Skuas on passage.
Fife -- A Black Redstart was seen near Upper Largo (14th) and a
Bluethroat was reported from the Isle of May (17th). A Black Redstart
was also present at St Abbs Head in the Borders.
Strathclyde -- Eleven Ruddy Ducks including seven drakes were at
Frankfield Loch in the north east of Glasgow (19th). Measures have now
been introduced in an attempt to control the numbers of breeding Ruddy
Ducks in this country. This is due to the occurrence of hybrids between
this species and the threatened White-headed Duck in Spain. A report of
up to six Dotterels seen on Blackcraig Hill near New Cumnock in Ayrshire
and an immature Common Crane (19th) was seen on Islay.
Grampian -- A single Lesser White Fronted Goose (leg-ringed) was
reported near the Ythan Estuary along with the Forsters Tern and King
Eider (21st) seen there last week. Also near the Ythan a Sabines Gull
(17th), a Curlew Sandpiper (16th) and reports of a Bee-Eater seen flying
overhead near Tiree. At the RSPB Loch of Strathbeg reserve a single Ruff
and Greenshank along with two Ruddy Ducks and a Ruddy Shelduck were
reported (19th).
Lothian -- A rare sighting of a Red Footed Falcon was reported from
near Dunbar (15th) but the bird could not be relocated. A Little Stint
was seen (16th, 17th) the wader scrape at the Musselburgh lagoons along
with some of the more common waders and gulls.
Tayside -- A Marsh Harrier was seen over Montrose basin along with a
Ruff there (19th). A Honey Buzzard was also seen overhead near
Kirriemuir. At the RSPB Vane Farm reserve a Little Egret was still
present (15th) along with the single Bean Goose. Up to eight Black
Necked Grebes remained at the Loch of Kinnordy and a female Marsh
Harrier was again reported there (19th).
Dumfries and Galloway -- At the Caerlaverock Wildfowl and Wetlands
Trust reserve a Spoonbill was present throughout the week last being
seen 19th.

The first movie
to be suppressed
in Britain was
a short film
about cheese
About 10% of all
18-certificate
movies are
cut before they
are released
CONFESSION time. This reporter must be one of the few adults in the
United Kingdom -- perhaps even the entire uncivilised world, who has yet
to see Reservoir Dogs. Fortunately, I have caught the ear-slicing clip
on the telly and, having heard my chums rave on about the movie so
often, I can recite the ''I don't wannabee Mr Pink'' scene word perfect.
The upshot is that I can now confidently bluff my way through any
conversation about Quentin Tarantino and the wee film which made him
famous.
Now, I have no excuse, reasonable or otherwise, for not seeing
Reservoir Dogs. I've nothing against its excessive, not to mention
gratuitous, violence (the rarified air way up on the moral high ground
is too heady a mix for the likes of me) and I know that when I
eventually sit down to watch the movie, I'll thoroughly enjoy it. No.
The reason why I've never seen Reservoir Dogs is that, silly old me, I
thought I'd wait until it came out on video.
The problem is that no-one told me it would be years rather than
months before it eventually gained a certificate for home viewing. The
movie, I am reliably informed, is finally scheduled for video release
within the next few weeks. Britain, I believe, is one of the last
countries in the world to see the video. Everybody else, from New York
to New South Wales, had it yonks ago.
The reason for the delay, of course, is well-known and, I suppose,
understandable in the circumstances. The movie suffered the moral
backlash from the Jamie Bulger case (you may recall that during the
trial there was some talk about the two child killers being influenced
by the video nasty, Child's Play 3).
But it highlights the fact that Britain boasts the most rigorous film
censorship rules in the Western world. It is estimated that about 10% of
all 18-certificate movies get the scissors treatment before they are
released. It's even worse when they reach the small screen, where it
often leads to some laughable dubbing, almost always to disguise the
f-word.
As part of its continuing celebration of 100 years of the cinema, BBC2
devotes much of its airtime on Sunday and Monday to Forbidden Weekend, a
series of documentaries and movies which explore in detail the issues of
taste, morality, and censorship in the film industry (cynics might
suggest that it's simply a ploy by the Beeb to brighten an otherwise
dull Bank Holiday weekend by showing a handful of dubious movies which
they've had neither the excuse nor the bottle to show before).
One point that is conspicuous by its absence in Empire of The Censors
(Sunday and Monday), a two-part examination of the history of British
film censorship, is that a brush with the movie police has never in 100
years done any harm to a film.
So long as the censors do not actually ban a film (and that is a rare
occurrence indeed), it is usually worth its weight in gold at the box
office, often providing a welcome notoriety and street cred to otherwise
mediocre movies.
Dozens of obscure, low-budget, films (Driller Killer, Romper Stomper,
Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Sound of Music etc.) would have sunk
without trace were it not for the ''adverse'' publicity which surrounded
them. The Sound Of Music bit was a joke, by the way.
Empire of The Censors includes interviews with film makers,
journalists, writers, and actors and it attempts to illustrate how
censorship has developed over the years, reflecting the effects of
violence, sex, political unrest, sex, blasphemy and, of course, sex at
any given time in the twentieth century.
It also shows some scenes which were cut from certain controversial
films, particularly Sam Peckinpah's excellent Straw Dogs. In that case,
as I recall, it was not so much because Susan George was brutally raped
during the siege at Trencher's Farm; it was because she appeared to
enjoy it.
Other clips lifted from the cutting room floor include Eisenstein's
classic Battleship Potemkin (banned by the British censors in 1926, the
year of the General Strike, because it was perceived to be a
pro-Bolshevik film), Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange (which the director
himself effectively banned because he believed that it had inspired
real-life violence), The Exorcist, Women In Love, and Oliver Stone's
Natural Born Killers (a thoroughly nasty film if ever there was one).
Falling very much into the ''not-a-lot-of-people-know-this'' category
is the fact that the first movie to be suppressed in Britain was a short
film about cheese. In 1898 Charles Urban (very much the John Grierson of
his day) filmed a slice of Stilton through a microscope. For the best
part of 90 seconds, the screen heaved with bacterial activity magnified
100 times. The cheese industry, worried that the sight could have an
adverse effect on sales, quickly had it withdrawn.
Contributors to the programme include directors Bernardo (Last Tango
In Paris) Bertolucci, Roman (Repulsion) Polanski, and Ken (The Devils)
Russell. Curiously, none of these men has ever made a film about cheese,
but they have all fallen foul of the censors.
The flamboyant Russell discusses the outcry and accusations of
blasphemy which followed the release, in the early seventies, of his
notoriously vulgar, The Devils. The movie, never before seen on
television, will be shown in its uncut version as part of the weekend
series (BBC2, Monday). It is not for the faint-hearted. Nor is it for
those with a modicum of taste.
Based on Aldous Huxley's novel, The Devils of Loudun, it is a
completely over-the-top, and occasionally very sick movie. A ''farrago
of witless exhibitionism,'' according to one critic at the time; ''A
garish glossary of sado-masochism . . . the masturbatory fantasies of a
Roman Catholic boyhood,'' according to another. I remember going to see
it as a teenager and loving it.
According to rumours, during the filming some female members of the
cast fled the set in shock, while others demanded an Equity
investigation into the alleged sexual assault of some of the performers.
Not surprisingly, the movie was severely trimmed by the British Board of
Film Censors before it gained a certificate. It is, however, something
of a cinematic novelty, being one of the very few films in which Oliver
Reed delivers a memorable performance while sober.
Other controversial films shown over the Forbidden Weekend go from the
sublime to the ridiculous. They include New Zealand director Peter
Jackson's aptly-named Bad Taste (a sci-fi shocker about an intergalactic
fast-food chain which specialises in manburgers); The Night Porter (Dirk
Bogarde as a sadistic former SS officer now working in a Viennese hotel,
and Charlotte Rampling as the concentration camp victim who becomes his
lover); and Performance (Nic Roeg's disturbing and violent psycho drama
which featured Mick Jagger in his first -- and last? -- acting role).
More instructive perhaps is a revealing documentary, Children of The
Video (Monday), which examines the effects which adult-certificate video
movies have on minors. It shows the peer pressure which is placed on
kids to watch the latest schock-horror videos and how Halloween or
Nightmare on Elm Street become required viewing for youngsters caught up
in a playground game of one-upmanship.
An accompanying survey of children aged between 8 and 11 in the
Manchester, Bristol, and London areas reveals that 43% had seen videos
of Terminator, which had an 18 certificate; 31% had seen the Lethal
Weapon (cert 15 and 18) films; 23% the Alien series (cert 18); and 15%
had seen Child's Play (cert 15).
The programe also reveals a somewhat complex range of emotions about
the violence which children see on the screen. Some of them have
nightmares, while others are able to distinguish between the horror
fantasy and real life.
Lastly, and on a somewhat lighter note, Forbidden Weekend presents a
not-entirely-serious examination of those peculiarly English soft-porn
movies of the post-war years. In Doing Rude Things (Monday) the
ubiquitous Angus Deayton takes the viewer on a guided tour of those
excrutiatingly embarrassing, nudge-nudge, naughty pictures from the
Health and Efficiency school of film-making.
It starts in the fifties with a look at the corny black-and-white
naturist films of that era, which rejoiced in such titles as ''Eves On
Skis'' and ''Sunswept''. These shorts, which were usually filmed in
nudist colonies, managed to evade the censors' scissors by attempting to
concentrate on healthy outdoor pursuits. Which is why they usually
involved naked women with huge busts playing volleyball, badminton, and
trampolining.
This short history of tat then moves on through the rather more sordid
Soho sex film industry of the Swinging Sixties (aptly named in the
circumstances) to the awful Confessions of a Window Cleaner series of
the early seventies.
In retrospect, there is something rather quaint, not to mention
innocent, about it all. Remarkable to think that, just five years later,
the devilish Mr Russell (nowadays a cuddly old grandad) would come along
with masturbating nuns, burnings at the stake, nails through the tongue,
and all manner of perversion.
* PAULA MILNE'S delicious tale of revenge, The Politician's Wife
(Channel 4, Tuesday), finally reaches its conclusion. Will the odious
philandering Duncan Matlock (Trevor Eve), a man so slimey that he could
crawl under a snake's belly with a top hat on his head, get his just
desserts at the hands of his once-dutiful wife, Flora (Juliet
Stevenson)? Or will the Tory Party machine gang up to save the
sleazebag's political career? Prepare yourself for a devious denouement
to this unmissable series.
* AVOID at all costs Castles (BBC1, Wednesday), a new 24-part drama
series so turgid that it makes you think perhaps El Dorado wasn't so bad
after all. It's a soap of sorts, but it's more carbolic than Cussons. A
bit like The Brothers only worse.
James and Margaret Castle (Tony Doyle and Anna Cropper), are a
well-healed middle-aged couple with more grown-up weans than you could
shake a stick at. In the exceedingly dull opening episode the whole
family is preparing to descend upon the Castles' castle for Margaret's
surprise sixtieth birthday party.
Unfortunately, the poor woman picks that particular moment to accuse
her hubby of having it off with a younger woman. It fair puts a damper
on the proceedings. Wednesday's opener to this family-feuding saga is an
hour-long; subsequent episodes will be 30-minutes long and shown on
Tuesdays and Thursdays.

THE man with the sort of grin you generally find only on traps
designed to maim small mammals was spot on: '' 'Am tellin' ya something,
the BBC2's gonna snap this crap up like that!'' And they did, of course.
Content, yet again, to settle for Sky's scraps, the corporation gave us
an entire week of Letterman in London (BBC2), as though just to prove
that his charm doesn't travel, after the satellite station was done with
him. He came, we saw, crap conquered.
Such leavings were here, such crumbs. Quality television as they know
it, direct from the US of A and straight into your livingroom like a
brick through the window. It's not enough to say that Letterman is awful
-- we knew that already, and the Oscar ceremonies only confirmed it --
but the unique nature of his awfulness requires some explanation.
Jonathan Ross was as slimy as the trail of a snail before he stole the
format. Danny Baker was as irritating as shingles before he began to
preface every remark with ''Let me tell you, people''. Neither was
funny, engaging, or at ease hosting chat shows.
So what made them believe, when they copied everything from the dumb
house band to the puerile lists and the revolting animal acts, that
Letterman's was a style to which they should aspire?
Americans love him. ''Dave'' is the king of plugathons, paid millions
of dollars a year to stand in front of an audience with a ''monologue''
(four jokes and a drum roll) before ensuring that a stream of
celebrities say nothing about anything, and certainly nothing that might
outshine their host -- even when that must seem impossible to avoid. If
it was good enough for the States it, like crack cocaine, hamburgers,
and cruise missiles, must be good enough for us.
The much-missed Larry Saunders Show sent Letterman up in fine style
(the result being that Gary Shandling was offered a real chat show of
his very own), but Dave is unabashed. This week he had his dear old
''mom'' despatched around the sights of London while he paraded every
bit of old tat that an especially ignorant American tourist might just
associate with England, a small city on the banks of the Thames.
The only question left begging was whether he brought his own audience
with him or whether squads of production assistants scoured the hotels
kidnapping fat couples from Iowa suffering from Dave depletion. This lot
howled and applauded as only aggrieved chimps and US TV audiences can.
Letterman ran his running gags into the ground, but each time he said
''knackered'' they laughed as though they had never laughed before in
their lives.
Peter O'Toole, like a cadaver with attitude, was the only guest in a
long week to make a dent in his host's tumour of an ego, and the old
droll had to arrive on a camel to do that. Otherwise, stars were marched
on and off like bit players: hug the host, plug the product, prove you
can still speak, and get off.
The point is that Letterman is taken seriously. Judging by the
laudatory profiles which appeared in the London press before he arrived,
British media folk, not least those charged with running BBC2, regard
him as a master. But of what, precisely? Not conversation, for Letterman
approaches the art with a demeanour that makes his entire face look like
a nervous tic.
Not wit, for even with squads of writers he delivers a joke as though
it were a death threat.
Blame the sort of cultural cringe that allows Britons to believe
Americans invented everything in television worth watching. It expresses
itself in the shallow boast that British TV is the ''best in the world''
while British viewers are being force-fed American imports. Suffice to
say that on this showing, Letterman made Wogan look good. I can think of
nothing more obscene.
And yet, and yet. . . The terrible irony is that when an intelligent
American is invited to do things in what might be called the British
way, the result is spellbinding. A Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese
Through American Movies (Channel 4, Sunday) was nothing more than a
lecture with illustrations.
Marty, as we-met-him-once namedroppers like to call him, just sat in
an armchair and explained, patiently, why cinema is the quintessential
American art, born out of the American experience of the west, Broadway,
and organised crime.
He knows all there is to know, yet Scorsese insisted time and again
that he would only describe the American century in film through his own
experience. This was sensible. Anyone who sits in a darkened cinema is
essentially alone; the experience is always personal. Equally, when
Marty discourses on the ''director's dilemma'' -- one picture for
yourself, one for the studio -- you realise he's talking from the heart.
Personally, I'd give him his own chat show.
Once upon a time Clive James knew what he was talking about. Now he
just knows the side on which his bread is buttered. Thus he reappeared
on ITV on Sunday with the Clive James Show, a programme which was, in
every miserable respect, the same smirking, self-obsessed package he
used to deliver on the BBC. Money, if not talent having changed hands,
James has lost another bit of his dwindling self-respect.
He's a clever man. We know this because he likes to prove it. We know,
too, that he has views on the degradation of culture and public life.
His excuse for this too-familiar, witless trawl through the funny ways
of foreigners must be something to hear.
Finally, in a thoroughly awful week, a little bit of praise for True
Stories -- The Class of 62 (Channel 4, Thursday). Marilyn Gaunt's
exploration of the effects of middle age on her former Leeds schoolmates
at first seemed content to prove that ordinary life is blindingly
ordinary. By stages, however, it revealed itself as a touching essay on
hope, loss, and love lost and found.
Whatever their misfortunes, each of these women seemed a living
demonstration of inner strength and calm, simple courage. It was worth a
year of Lettermans.

THERE was a significant difference throughout this year's General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland which ended in Edinburgh last night.
Normally the best ladies' hats are to be seen in the throne gallery to
the Queen's High Commissioner's left hand, where the nobility, the VIP
guests, and the flashy uniforms of the equerries are to be found. To her
right are the wives of the Moderator, ex-Moderators, and committee
conveners who exude bonhomie but whose bonnets do not usually reach the
heights of haute couture (with the exception in recent years of the
elegant Mrs Wyllie).
This year it was different. With the election of former Army Chaplain
General, James Harkness, as Moderator there arrived a sparkling array of
ladies' fashion and the conveners' wives rose to the occasion. (I rather
liked the dark blue hat worn by the lady doctor from Dumbarton.)
Military wives and daughters sure know about millinery.
However, the Kirk is supposed to be neither military nor millinery. It
is supposed to be part of the Church Militant, marching to the sound of
the trumpet which should not make an uncertain sound (as Mr Harkness
reminded us in his sermon on Sunday in St Giles'). The trouble this year
was that the note sounded by many of the leading committees was
cancelled by many of the votes taken and has left me with the impression
of an army which is uncertain whether it is retreating or being fired on
by its own troops.
Let us look at what happened. The Assembly Council had its schemes of
priorities voted out. The Board of Practice and Procedure had its plans
shelved to make 75 the upper-age limit for presbyters and commissioners.
In an array of cases (Stirling, Alloa, Shetland etc) the plaintiffs won
against the might of committees and presbyteries. Was this then a sign
of an underdog Assembly, an anarchic one, or an example of democracy
making bureaucracy think again?
None of these explanations seems to me to fit the bill. Although
officially there are not groups or parties within the Kirk, historically
the Assembly used to be divided on party lines between moderates and
evangelicals in the way the House of Commons is divided between Tories
and Labour. Yes there were crossbenches but in a crisis people would
usually vote one way or the other. In more recent years it would be more
accurate to divide the Kirk into three groups.
First, the Auld Kirk moderates who had dominated since the
mid-nineteenth century, when the Disruption removed nearly all the
evangelicals. They were the movers and shakers, deciding things on
practical grounds and inclined to a love of the establishment. In more
recent years they held sway in the committees which ran money and
buildings, ministry and pay, practice and procedure.
Second, the evangelicals, who re-emerged after the 1929 Union but who
have never seemed to get their act together to take the Kirk from its
mainstream position on doctrine and morals into a more fundamentalist
stance. Their traditional areas of influence are mission, social
responsibility, and doctrine. The reason they have not made greater
progress despite having been augmented over the years by a greater
proportion of the intake for the ministry is probably due to the rise of
the third grouping -- the Lib-Lab liberals.
Their habitat is Iona and the Church and Nation Committee but in
recent years following a reshuffle of boards, they have become
influential in education, at parish and political level, and in the
World Mission and Unity area. Indeed there is a new establishment of
committee people and ''121'' administrators who are drawn from the
charmed circle of Edinburgh's chattering classes. They were the ones who
slashed the Assembly Council to pieces last week as it tried to steer a
course through this power triad.
All these groups have their unacceptable faces. The moderates (among
whom I usually find myself sitting and voting) sometimes decide issues
for unspiritual reasons and are all too human. The evangelicals are
sometimes tempted into fundamentalist extremism and not human enough.
The liberals seem indistinguishable at times from a political party and
harbour phoney liberals who seem to love the pagan headhunter in
Bongobongoland more than their neighbour who is a freemason.
You used to be able to tell the different groups not only by the way
they voted but where they went for lunch. Moderates went for a pub
lunch. Evangelicals used the in-house facilities and liberals went to a
hunger lunch for the Third World.
The rise of the liberals has come at a time of reaction to the
Thatcher years in government. They have recently captured the citadel of
doctrine and under Principal Newlands will probably provoke some
crusades by evangelicals when their report on the authority of scripture
comes out. At present the centre still holds, but moderatism is weaker.
At present the cash crisis has not holed the ship beneath the
waterline but before a prosperous voyage can be undertaken the wind must
be seen to blow in a particular direction. My impression after last week
was that no definite direction can yet be discerned. The changes, like
the fashions, were cosmetic.
The most interesting future prospect was unveiled by someone with a
red hat who belongs to none of the parties of the Kirk. Let's hope the
Christian Assembly called for by Cardinal Winning will not end up
divided on party lines.

DAVID SAINSBURY'S claim that planning constraints are frustrating his
supermarket chain's expansion plans should be taken with a pinch of salt
(May 23).
Your report states that he says that very restrictive planning
procedures have prevented Sainsbury from expanding as quickly as it
would have liked; however, it fails to mention that these guidelines
have only recently been drafted in response to very valid concerns, and
that he is concerned purely with out-of-town stores.
The new guidelines are to be implemented because of increasing concern
for the vitality of our town centres given the growth of out-of-town
superstores and the associated redistribution of investment away from
town centres.
The demise of many of our town centres has been, in a large part, due
to previous Government policy allowing retailers to locate in greenfield
sites and therefore it is vital that these retailers are encouraged to
re-establish themselves within our town centres so that they become the
vibrant foci for communities that they once were.
Town centres are better locations for shops in both environmental and
social terms: they minimise the loss of greenfield sites and they are
better served by public transport. Therefore they are more accessible to
all sectors of society and reduce dependency on the car, and they
provide the town centre with an area which acts as a heart for social
and community interaction.
These new Scottish Office guidelines demonstrate that planning
procedures are, more often than not, used in a positive manner to help
our communities. They are not always a negative process. Perhaps Mr
Sainsbury should take a look beyond his company's own ideals and bear
this in mind.

I REFER to the article on licensed conveyancers by Stewart McIntosh
(May 24). Why should it be assumed that the introduction in Scotland of
licensed conveyancers would lead to a reduction in conveyancing fees?
Would their overheads be any less than those borne by solicitors?
Would not licensed conveyancers have to maintain business premises and
employ staff in the way which solicitors have to do at present? I cannot
see how the level of fee charged can be divorced from the question of
overheads.
One significant overhead which solicitors have to bear is the cost of
professional indemnity insurance. In terms of the relevant Act of
Parliament, it is clear that licensed conveyancers would have to make
similar arrangements.
No doubt the business would ultimately be placed with the same
insurance companies and the premiums would probably be just as heavy.
The practice of conveyancing inevitably involves the handling of
considerable sums of clients' money. Solicitors have to comply with very
stringent accounts rules, necessitating the employment of cash-room
staff. It is reasonable to envisage that licensed conveyancers would
have to comply with similar regulations.
Many members of the public seeking conveyancing services do make
inquiries of a number of solicitors' firms for conveyancing quotes. It
is wrong to suggest that there is no competition. The competition is
amongst solicitors.

THERE is no harm in having conversations with the Scottish Episcopal
Church ''to see where the Spirit leads'' (May 23).
The Episcopal Bishop of St Andrews claims his church has put its house
in order by having women priests and the Rev Maxwell Craig, of the
Church of Scotland, claims that the Episcopal Church's bishops, being
elected, could be congenial alongside supervision by one's peers.
Let us look behind the scenes. Why has the Scottish Episcopal Church
made its proposal? On behalf of church unity, yes. Claiming that its
bishops are not like other bishops? That remains to be seen. But even if
its bishops are elected, are they consecrated by other bishops and does
this imply a different view of apostolic succession from that of the
Church of Scotland?
If the Anglican type of historical episcopate no longer matters, there
is certainly no need for the Church of Scotland to set its house in
order as regards the form of ministry.
Behind all this, of course, is the World Council of Churches' approach
which has by-passed the simple solution of mutual recognition as the
historic denominations stand.
The United Reformed Church has made room for provincial seven-year
moderators who can sometimes be reappointed for five years. This is one
of many ecumenical gambits ultimately tending to converge on a threefold
ministry with bishops.
No doubt the Scottish Episcopal Church is well aware of this, which
may account for part of its proposal. Whey doesn't it just become a
diocese of the Church of England?
Spiritually I see no evidence to suggest that bishops would improve
the Christian life of any denomination. Spiritual unity needs nothing
more than acceptance of the Lordship of Christ, with inter-communion for
all the historic denominations, which includes the Church of Scotland.
Even some ecumenical scholars concede that diversity of structures is
possible but the wording of documents often allows for a thin edge of
the wedge in favour of episcopacy.
And we do have supervisors in the Church of Scotland, in the form of
presbyteries and assembly.

ONCE again the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland has sunk
into its usual mediocrity convincing me that the silly season takes
place annually in the third week in May. I refer to your report of
Tuesday's proceedings (May 24).
Does the Rev Alan Sorensen, of Househillwood St Christopher's, really
think that the purchase of a modern digital computerised keyboard is the
answer to providing decent music in the church? I am baffled as to why
his congregation went to the expense of buying an organ for his church
without first ascertaining the availability of an organist to play it.
There is no substitute for the live musician in the church and, if he
was honest with himself, he would admit it. I am delighted that the Rev
John Bell, whose own ideas of music for the Church are what we have come
to expect of him -- see Songs of God's People -- opposed the motion that
the Panel on Worship should investigate replacing traditional organ
accompaniment with some kind of alternative.
There is nothing finer than congregational singing led by a competent
organist. Perhaps Househillwood St Christopher's should think about
proper remuneration for the services of an organist next time they
advertise for one.
Alternatively, if members of his congregation wish to hear decent live
music there are many churches in the Glasgow area which provide it.

HUMANISTS indeed are opposed to segregated education and religious
observance in schools. Our position here does not justify Mr Blackshaw's
response to Mr McSherry calling humanists historical illiterates (May
12). Mr McSherry appears to be writing from a religious standpoint.
Our movement is rooted in the past, drawing inspiration from classical
times and onwards. Most of our members are aware of this intellectual
background.
The term hypocrisy might be more aptly applied to those church members
who fail to live up to the precepts of their founder.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if the Scottish people -- those with and
those with no religious faith -- could work together to eliminate
sectarianism?

ALEX SALMOND'S article is a classic example of how, by the selective
use and misuse of facts, parties who have followed all the due processes
of law can be made to appear as if they are acting illegally (May 24).
Before the decommissioning of any offshore structure in UK waters can
take place operating companies must obtain Government permission to do
so. This is only secured after the most rigorous investigations and
assessments of all the viable options have been completed and an
abandonment programme submitted.
The programme will include a safety case identifying the potential
hazards and demonstrating how the risks to people employed in
decommissioning will be reduced to as low as reasonably practicable.
Operators will also assess the potential environmental impacts,
including those that will occur both offshore and onshore.
This assessment will be evaluated in conjunction with the safety and
cost implications to arrive at the best practicable environmental
option. Furthermore, to obtain Government approval operators'
abandonment plans must comply with the International Maritime
Organisation's requirements.
After several years of examining Shell's abandonment plan the
Government agreed that the safest, most viable, and best practical
environmental option for disposing of Brent Spar is by sinking it in
very deep water. This decision took all the environmental aspects into
account as well as ensuring that there would be no danger to any users
of the sea.
Only a handful of structures similar to, but smaller than, the Brent
Spar exist offshore and, therefore, its disposal in deep water will be a
one-off.
The vast majority of offshore installations will be totally removed
and taken ashore when they reach the end of their economic life. The
Government has agreed that the decommissioning option for each of the
remaining 50 installations will be prepared and assessed on a
case-by-case basis.
The UK Offshore Operators Association deplores the dangerous and
illegal occupation of an offshore installation to delay its
decommissioning after all the national and international processes
governing such action have been complied with in full.
We would assure you that Britain's offshore oil and gas industry
remains committed to doing all that is reasonably practicable to reduce
the risk of damage to the environment in which it works.

<ARTICLETYPE>CORRESPONDENCE</ARTICLETYPE>
<RECORDNO>978190529</RECORDNO>

IN his review of A Union for Empire: Political Thought and the Union
of 1707 Michael Fry claims that ''perhaps the main point to emerge is
that there was no outrage 300 years ago'' (May 22).
If he means outrage in the older usage of the word, ''violence beyond
measure'', then we know that he is correct in that there was no general
uprising against the Union at the time -- though violence in the shape
of the English army was undoubtedly threatened.
But if he means outrage in the modern usage of the word, ''profound
indignation, anger, or hurt'' his claim is quite preposterous.
A fundamental, long-lived, and pernicious ''hurt'' caused by the Union
is, I suspect, not covered by any of this new book's contributors. (I
will read it in due course and find out.) I refer to the deep feelings
of shame and guilt which the Union repressed individually and
collectively in the national psyche in the eighteenth century.
They resulted from defeat without battle for the  honourable and
proudly independent-minded Scottish nation, with its rich store of tales
of valour and successful defence against English aggression down the
generations. Those repressed emotions, mostly in the subconcious,
continue to be a source of weakness in the national psyche.
By his regular writings Mr Fry seeks to uphold the Union. He and his
like have drawn for centuries on the repressed shame of 1707 to maintain
the Union and prevent the evolution of a modern, democratic, and
independent Scotland.
But now that more and more people understand the powers of repressed
guilt and shame, at personal, family, and collective levels, and are
thereby enabled to overcome them, the days of the Union are numbered and
it will be replaced with a new and dignified partnership with our
neighbours south of the Tweed, and with the rest of humanity.

MR ALI shows an astonishing naivety in his letter criticising general
practitioners (May 23).
The doctor/patient relationship is the fundamental basis of the
consultation and ensuing medical care. It involves co-operation and an
understanding in both parties. Without this it cannot function.
Over the past few years, more and more doctors have been subjected to
abuse, threats, and are having to tolerate unreasonable behaviour in the
course of their work.
In this sort of situation, the doctor/patient relationship can be
irretrievably damaged. If the patient is dissastisfied with his or her
doctor, he or she is free to change doctor without giving any reason.
The doctor has a similar right.
Mr Ali feels that the law should be changed so that GPs fulfil their
obligations to their patient. He is clearly unaware of the fact that a
patient, no matter how aggressive or unreasonable, or whether or not
have a history of violence against doctors or health-care staff in the
past, will be provided with a general practitioner by the health board.
Perhaps this is a right which needs to be reviewed.

AT a recent gathering of, admittedly, some senior readers of The
Herald, I discovered that I was not the only one who found William
Hunter's derisive mini-biography of Vic Oliver more acerbic than
accurate (May 9).
Hi Gang, the radio show in which he worked with Bebe Daniels and Ben
Lyons, was funny, and the ongoing gags and catch-phrases are no more or
less ridiculous out of context than lines from any other popular radio
series then or since.
I remember a concert in St Andrew's Halls in Glasgow in 1946, when he
conducted extremely well a classical programme with an orchestra of
Polish musicians. This concert was also given in the Albert Hall in
London where his musical ability was accepted enthusiastically, as had
been his talents as a leading man in several long-running revues in the
late thirties.
As for his craggy appearance, perhaps that, as well as his acting
ability, equipped him to play in a tour of Robert Sherwood's Idiot's
Delight in 1938 (as Robert Van -- the part played by Clark Gable in the
film).

triumphantly that the SNP victory was a vote for independence. Somehow
we doubt it. This seems a churlish, even contradictory, thing to say in
the aftermath of the overturning of a Tory majority and the setting out
of a sound SNP majority of 7311 votes. But the SNP majority was not
quite the bell-ringing triumph which some assessments had led us to
expect. The uneasy feeling remains that the SNP has been chosen by the
voters in that constituency as the best vehicle to convey a message of
severe resentment to the Government. Nor is it likely that in their
disgruntlement the voters of Perth and Kinross are much different from
any roughly similar constituency around the country. What is this
message which the electorate wishes to send? Any election is an
imprecise way to measure the true feelings of voters as far as
individual policies are concerned. There is too much baggage in the way
in the form of old loyalties, multiple-policy platforms, and individual
personalities, for the marking of an ''X'' on the spot to convey
anything other than general acceptance of a party. Therefore we must
look for other evidence of anomalies to give a clue.
Quite the most startling set of figures to fit this bill was included
towards the end of our own poll of voting intentions earlier in the
week. This showed that, of those planning to vote SNP, some 49%
preferred a Scottish parliament with substantial powers, while only 43%
wanted a completely independent Scottish parliament. This at least
raises the possibility that the excellent vote for the SNP comprises a
substantial number of people who would prefer devolution to
independence. Quite what the SNP makes of this is of some interest for
the future. It is possible that Roseanna Cunningham might, as the Tories
allege, have some difficulty holding on to the seat if so many of those
who voted for her have problems with independence. Then again, all the
signs are that she will be an excellent constituency MP and quite
persuasive enough to stand at least an even chance of hanging on to
enough of her support at a General Election. It will be interesting to
watch, as will the development of the devolution and Union arguments in
Scotland over the next few months. In this respect the Tories, who are
heartened by anything other than lost deposits these days, might allow
themselves a measure of quiet hope. There are sufficient rumours of
consultations on a change of emphasis for their Scottish policies which,
taken together with pressure from both the right and the left of the
party, might yet result in a shading of Mr Major's fevered
anti-devolution rhetoric.
This would be welcome, but probably deceitful. Scattering a little
glitter over the Scottish dimension without any substantive policies to
support it would be useless. Stressing the value of the Union might
chime in with a good deal of Scottish thinking, but the Tories are not
the only pro-Union party. Their support for the Union is a stifling one,
denying the need for proper domestic control of Scottish affairs.
Various small tracheotomies might be performed, sufficient to allow a
little oxygen into the thrapple of Tory policies, but the outcome would
be the same; suffocation. Next time around Mr Godfrey will either have
to stand down or acquaint himself with the realities of Scottish
politics which exist for the main outside the briefings of his own
party. The Liberal Democrats did not do well, but the important
announcement by Mr Ashdown yesterday, dissolving the policy of
''equidistance'' from the main parties and pledging not to support a
minority Conservative Government, is of the highest significance. It is
the right decision for his party, demolishing the argument that a vote
for the Liberal Democrats is wasted, and it may earn them the gratitude,
and votes, of a nation which clearly wants almost anything in the future
other than another Conservative Government. A Liberal Democrat candidate
in Perth and Kinross would also benefit from this.
For the Labour Party, in a very non-Labour constituency, the puzzles
remain. Mr Alexander did well, but there are other constituencies where
he would have done better. Nor was he helped by an over-hyped Labour
campaign and the surprisingly ineffective visit of his party leader.
Where we go from here in terms of Scottish politics is anybody's guess,
but at least there is life, the galvanising effect of issues, and
sufficient puzzles to keep this yeasty broth bubbling for the next two
years.

THE credibility of the UN mission in Bosnia is now balanced acutely on
the line between possible success and abject failure. The bombing raids
on Serb munitions bunkers outside Pale are merely the outward
manifestations of a struggle over policy which will result in the
presentation of new options to the UN Security Council and their
discussion in the next few days. Three years of confused, ineffective,
and frequently disputatious ''peacekeeping'' lie behind what may be a
welcome shift in policy. The problem is that the new policy directions
are far from clear, and will not work if they imply any political
message which can be interpreted by the obdurate Bosnian Serbs as
weakness or as a willingness to withdraw under pressure.
The bombing of the munitions bunkers was, in every way conceivable, a
just response to barbarity. If it has been as effective as the UN hopes
it will also reduce Bosnian Serb capacity to carry out more outrages,
thus delivering a political message with the effective addition of
force. The Serb shelling of Tuzla, which appears to have triggered the
second attack by Nato jets, killed 71 people ranging in ages from
two-and-a-half to 28. Among the many dreadful massacres of a very dirty
war, this one is prominent in its ugliness.  The ugliness will not,
however, go away because of wishful thinking, appeasement of Serbs, or
the slightest suggestion that the UN forces will either withdraw or
reduce their forces under pressure. The UN Secretary General Mr Boutros
Boutros Ghali appears to have inclined towards these options in recent
days. They are at variance with the new, tougher policy of bombing the
Serbs in retaliation for their murderous attacks. What this rather
contradictory message conveys is open to interpretation; in other words,
it is a mystery.
The United States is as vigorous as ever in its demands to punish the
Serbs but, as has been pointed out on numerous occasions, there are no
US ground troops there, either as peacekeepers or as hostages. The new
willingness to use air strikes to reinforce UN demands is welcome but it
must be accompanied by renewed political pressure. The UN, for all its
faults, is the only worldwide organisation which ameliorates the horrors
of the situation. Now, as the Bosnian Serbs are at possibly their
weakest point, is not the time to withdraw.

As Strathclyde makes way for a new unitary authority, its education
director considers his prospect
FRANK Pignatelli, Strathclyde region's director of education, flew out
to South Africa yesterday to take part in an initiative aimed at shaping
the education service in the post-apartheid democracy. The country faces
huge problems as it seeks to build a fair, equitable, and
properly-funded service which, despite the demise of apartheid, remains
the preserve of privileged white pupils.
It is a measure of the esteem in which Pignatelli is held that he was
invited by the Overseas Development Agency to be the UK's representative
at a major two-day conference in Cape Town, whose participants have the
task of coming up with proposals for the organisation, governance, and
funding of education in South Africa.
Over the years Strathclyde's education department, the biggest local
authority department in the UK, has given advice and support to the
African National Congress and, more recently, officials and ministers of
the South African government of national unity on such educational
matters as setting up administrations, inspecting schools, staffing, and
decentralising to school level.
South African President Nelson Mandela recognised Strathclyde's
assistance when, on his visit to Glasgow last year, he thanked
Pignatelli personally for the authority's support, which he hoped would
continue.
Mandela spoke about the cultural and racial problem of ownership for
schools in a system which continued to be managed predominantly by white
bureaucrats used to running an apartheid education service essentially
for the white elite.
Pignatelli's presence in Cape Town will be confirmation of
Strathclyde's continued support, but it will last only until next April,
when the regional council will be broken up and replaced by 12 unitary
authorities in the Scotland-wide reform of local government.
The paradox is not lost on Pignatelli. In South Africa he will address
a 17-strong committee about the statement of aims -- promoting quality,
equality, access, and partnership -- which has shaped the education
department's policies and given it a reputation beyond its extensive
boundaries.
Yet, on his return to Glasgow, he will go back to the melancholic task
of running down the service for which he has worked for 26 years,
initially as a classroom teacher and ultimately as director responsible
for an annual budget of #1.3 billion, 36,000 staff, and 2090 schools and
other educational establishments.
Talking earlier this week about his visit to South Africa, Pignatelli
explained that he was one of four international experts nominated by the
ODA to make presentations and take workshops which will also impinge on
cultural, racial, and equity issues.
''That's quite encouraging in a period of deep depression,'' he joked.
If you believe, as he does, that you have the best job in the world, and
if you tell your colleagues, as he does, that you would not give it up
even if you won the lottery, then overseeing the orderly disintegration
of the service you run cannot be the most uplifting of tasks.
When it became apparent that the authority's campaign against the
Government's reform had fallen on deaf ears, and that John Major's
''monstrosity'' would indeed go, Pignatelli gave the council a
commitment that he would stay on to manage the demise of the education
department and ensure the smooth transition of services to the
single-tier authorities.
That has also involved helping to secure posts for his colleagues in
the new councils and it is a measure of the pace of change that the
department's senior management team of 13 is now down to four members,
with the possibility of further reductions in coming weeks.
What of Pignatelli himself? The rumour factory has been working
overtime to place him in a variety of jobs. He will join the Scottish
Office, perhaps as chief executive of a curriculum and assessment
council (which does not exist, at least as yet); he will take a senior
post in one of the single-tier councils; he will go into the private
sector, perhaps in a senior personnel position with a multinational; he
will become an academic (he actually is visiting professor in the
department of education at Glasgow University); he will establish a
consultancy.
But the scuttlebutt has no basis in fact. Pignatelli has not applied
for any job, either in any of the unitary councils or elsewhere. Nor has
he been made any offers of employment. If these circumstances prevail
through to vesting day on April 1 next year, he will comply with the
regulations for council employees and make himself the subject of a
statutory transfer order.
Procedurally, and because of the scale of his job, he will be
transferred to Glasgow unitary council, the biggest authority to emerge
from Strathclyde's demise -- which will no doubt promptly make him
redundant because it will be unlikely to be in a position to accommodate
him and the #94,000 salary he earns.
That salary; and what about that big one-off payment and pension deal
he will inherit next April? Again, scuttlebutt. The regulations state
that because he is under 50 he will receive the basic redundancy deal of
one year's salary, taxed -- and he will not receive his Strathclyde
pension until he is 65.
When he gave his commitment to the council there was the possibility
of a package emerging for 49-year-olds who would just miss out on the
redundancy arrangements for those aged 50 and over, who receive a lump
sum and a generous annual pension.
But the special deal did not materialise and Pignatelli had to think
again about his future, because of the financial shortfall associated
with the range of options likely to be open to him.
In a sense Iain Drysdale, leader of the Conservative group on
Strathclyde region, got it right when he told Pignatelli that he had
just been priced out of the market when he learned of the salary levels
for senior officers recommended by management consultants after a review
of their responsibilities.
The job itself has also mitigated against the education chief. Aside
from its sheer scale, there is probably not another post in the public
sector in Scotland which would allow him to exercise such a range of
management responsibilities and give him the freedom to develop
services, in line with Strathclyde's social strategy to invest in
education as a means of combating deprivation.
When he was appointed at the age of 41, he was charged with the task
of changing the culture of the education service; of adopting an open,
consultative approach. But it is not in his nature to shirk issues, even
if it leads to confrontation with the teachers' unions on such issues as
absence cover or with parents over school closures.
''I quite enjoy risk-taking and the rough and tumble that can go with
it. All I have done in my life is get the head down and work in the
expectation that you will meet challenges and get more and more to do,''
he said.
When the management consultants reviewed his job they took into
account the discretionary element it involved and the fact that much of
it was public-relations related. Pignatelli regularly works an 18-hour
day. Conferences and meetings of the parents' consultative group on the
curriculum which he chairs mean that he rarely has a free weekend.
Involving parents in curricular issues -- an initiative which is being
extended throughout Strathclyde's divisions -- is one of many
innovations introduced under his stewardship. The authority was ahead of
the Scottish Office in devolving budgetary decision-making powers to
headteachers.
In line with a commitment to give value for money and make the service
more accountable to the public, it has a quality assurance system which
is involved in monitoring school performance.
Among social strategy initiatives, the supported study scheme -- which
enables pupils from disadvantaged areas to work in school after hours,
supervised by teachers -- has already reaped rewards in terms of
improved examination results.
Pignatelli's commitment to instilling entrepreneurial skills in pupils
as a means of improving their prospects has won him many admirers in the
business community. You have clout when you can remind your audience
that you are ultimately responsible for the education of half of
Scotland's school pupils.
And it is no coincidence that he chairs the group given the key task
of shaping the curriculum and assessment procedures with the minimum of
disruption for the forthcoming reform of upper secondary schooling.
Looking back on his department's work, he said: ''We are just
beginning to see the benefits of what we have done. I feel sad that we
did not get the chance to see the full fruition, but it is a good legacy
to pass on to others.''
In a sense it was inevitable that he would work in education, although
he recalls that he ''kind of drifted'' into teaching. A third generation
Scot whose grandfather emigrated from Italy at the turn of the century,
Pignatelli was brought up in Anderston, in Glasgow.
''Youngsters from working class families who went to university became
teachers, engineers, or doctors, because these were the professions they
came into contact with. I didn't have the qualifications for anything
else, so I did French and Italian, which I had done at school.''
But he spent 18 months working as a bus conductor between leaving St
Mungo's Academy after sixth year and going to Glasgow University -- from
which his son, Paul, and daughter, Angela, have also graduated, and at
which his wife, Rosetta, is completing a course in counselling. ''I did
not get enough to get into university when I was at school because I
spent too much time with Rosetta.''
Again in lighter vein, he said he realised there was something better
than the buses when he was going out at 4am to start his shift and
meeting his brother Willie coming in after seeing his girlfriend. But he
studied in the evenings and got the Highers he needed for university. He
became a modern languages teacher after graduating and rapidly climbed
the promotion ladder to become an assistant head, the post he left to
become an education officer in Renfrew division.
The rest is history. Well, not quite. Pignatelli has been attending
valedictory functions with staff from the various divisions. Addressing
a group of secondary heads recently, he noted that the single-tier
authorities were advertising for directors of education at salaries
which were working out at about 80% of the remuneration for chief
executives.
There are 12 chief executives in the councils emerging from
Strathclyde's demise, and their annual salary bill will be #923,000. So
the 12 directors of education will cumulatively be earning about
#728,000 a year.
Pignatelli said, somewhat facetiously, that he would do the job for
half the amount. In truth he would do it for much less: #634,000 less,
in fact.

As the snow melts and the flowers bloom, Winter yearns for the
love-affair with Spring to continue. Spring however, feels alive and
free and as Marcella Evaristi reports, blinded by the sunlight and
warmth before her as Summer approaches
There is a point where a lovers' quarrel stops being a quarrel between
lovers and becomes an exchange between one bored person and one
despairing person.
Green as new paint, predictable as grass and stupid as the daisies.
And there was me -- thinking youth was strength
Spring -- Poem for Molly
Spring to new beginnings
if the winter's let you out
of March and clouts
and shivering, calendars and doubts.
Spring to new recordings,
to the song on shakey legs,
the eyelash of the stranger
and the grass below us yet.
There are hailstones in the morning
and flicker hope at noon,
there are bargains in the travel agents,
hope against Dunoon.
There are girls glad-eyeing dresses,
strappy cotton for their boys,
there are early morning wakenings,
streaming light before the noise
of the traffic on Great Western Road
and chilling brittle bills,
there's a dancer, floor above me,
who gave birth to her new girl.
Brill new baby, said my daughter.
an enternal six years wise,
tap dancing with her brother
who kick starts the past's demise.
* * *
YOU can't tell me anything, said Spring to Winter, and before he could
open his mouth she said, You bore me. Everything is before me, she said,
and you, with your old hoary breath of experience just tell me sad old
tales with moral endings. I fancy dancing, and you proffer Horlicks, I
want to salivate and you offer scones and the dry bones of sense.
You'll regret this, said Winter. That's the point, said Spring. We
were happy enough, weren't we? he said, trying to make the yearning in
his voice sound reasonable. You had your odd little foray, wee sunshine
splashes, and then my rain came down and we were safe together again,
home for tea.
I don't want tea, I want wine. You're too young, said Winter. Too
young for you, said Spring, her voice cork-screwing his heart. He had
been side-by-side with her for a while, when the humans in the co-op
complained of the changeable weather, dithering between wool and
brollies and cotton, because of their odd alliance.
How he had loved those days when she was too insecure to go out very
far, when she still respected his distinguished frost, and the skeletal
grace of his trees. She was like an apprentice skater then, looking back
at him over her shoulder, checking his presence, asking precisely where
the thin ice was. Wobbling and coltish she would only twirl a little
then, before falling back to him, laughing admittance for her need, her
old dear prop. And then home. But not now.
The distinguished now looks feeble in her wide eyes. You are so
selfish, he said, petulantly. I kept you safe, he said, dying. Well, I
kept you warm, she said, looking at a point past his shoulder. What are
you looking at? He tried to sound reasonable, but he was jealous of the
very air around her, those molecules bobbing like a dance he could not
join around her head.
I'm just looking, she said. I'm Spring, it's new, all of it, and I'm
looking. OK? Don't be vulgar, he said, defeated.
You are sculpted out of Deja Vu, and I'm new. I'm impressionable, I'm
impressed, I'm mesmerised, I'm ganting, I'm as vulgar as Bambi, I'm a
pushover for Mister Next Stage.
Who is he? cried Winter. I don't know, said Spring. Don't lie to me,
he said, He won't treat you as well as I did, you know that, don't you?
He won't, whoever he is.
I don't know who he is, said Spring, an unfamiliar boredom budding in
her heart.
He'll burn out, he said, and with the unfairness of youth she liked
the sound of that. He will, he rallied, uselessly. (For whether you are
a season or a person, trying to get the upper hand when you are being
dumped, is as helpful as skating boots in the desert.)
You are vulgar, pomped Winter, pretending his dignity was a kind of
cashmere. (He wanted a cashmere of a girl, you see, not a mad lamb.) My
perfect white was too pure for the likes of you! I made a stillness that
stopped time for a while, my coldness turned outline into silhouette, my
perfect light made children gasp. I am the real new, not you, he said,
like the Lear he was, with all the incapacity of failed surrender.
It's not a competition, she said, winning. She was now looking solidly
into the middle distance. There is a point where a lovers' quarrel stops
being a quarrel between lovers and becomes an exchange between one bored
person and one despairing person, and that's when you know the whole
pact is irrevocably dead. And that's where Spring was now: fearful,
expectant and deliriously looking.
Winter's possessiveness had turned her curiosity into full-blown lust.
Spring lusted wantonly now, with no need for the fact of him, whoever he
was. For desire is a free-floating thing, it exists before the love
affair, a curtain up before the unknown audience arrives. Innocence does
not exist, only credulity, and her carnival heart was singing: ''Lie to
me, lie with me, melt me with deceit.''
And Winter, hearing that song, gave up Christmas, gave up Dickensian
kitsch with its sleigh bells and claret, its toddies and sledges, and he
hated her with purity that felt like home. He would oversee her demise,
for he could not let her go. No, Winter could not see her skating on
when she did not look back at him. I am not Santa season, he keened to
himself, I am cold celibacy and death and I will win, Mistress Rosebud.
Go bugger up some crocuses as a last little power thrust, she said,
I'm out of here.
Vulgar, he said, marrying his loss. Who is he?
Look, she said, there he is at the end of the field, and Winter looked
there, blank and hopeless as a snow drift. He did not know what to do
with himself, he was not even a pen pal to his own heart, he just stood
and looked. It was as if he had died, he the signore of the birds who
had failed to travel to warmth, the lord of the icicle's perfection, the
experienced blanket tossed away, superfluous in the face of a young
girl's fever. His cynicism, as like a Sunday Post single slipper,
laughable, making his old toes sweat.
Look, I am about to run, said Spring. What is it about him, Winter
said, can you describe it before you go? I would like to kill you, but I
don't think I have the stamina. I would like to love you, she said, but
I don't have the patience. I do not want patience, though your
protective sheets were nice, what is it about him you ask?
He is what I am not -- yet, he is the unfairness of perfect shoulder
blades, he is the boy on the balcony, he is a selfish peach. And that's
what you want? said Winter. I could give you a roof. Like a bad hat, she
said, cruel as Hedda Gabbler. Winter, you are Judge Brack, I will not
sit on the chaise longue masturbating hope into coffee cups.
You quote badly, he said. I don't care, said Spring.
Well go for him then. There's a twig who needs my attention, a perfect
angle against a distillation of sky. Lord give me a cad, old man, it is
preferable to this dry talk.
End in tears it will, Winter said. Yes, said the girl, but at least I
will burn.
LORD, I KNOW what he felt like now. This is what he felt when I was
hair-tossing running across the corny field to Summer. This is the
demise Winter cursed for me, when the boy floored me, on my back in the
meadow. Green as new paint, predictable as grass and stupid as the
daisies. And there was me -- thinking youth was strength.
My cruel hot lord made a Barbie doll of me, rivalled by Jackie
Onassis, cool and dead and elegant. I am a Hollywood extra, whilst his
very De Niro vest mocks my aspirations. Look at me, Winter and laugh. My
oxygen is his bored exhalation now and I am lost.
Nothing I describe nudges his shades, nothing I can become shifts his
disdain. Maybe there is a cruelty in us that needs to be discarded
before breathing can begin.
In the beginning, when we were blossoming, when he thought me the bees
knees, my youthfulness struck him as fresh as gingham, drew out a
tenderness from raging Summer I believed would last.
But now he thinks my gawkiness is gauche, he cannot be contained by my
light prettiness and I watch him swell and salivate for headier stuff.
He wants to sink his teeth into bursting fruit, and my frilliness leaves
him unsatisfied. But I continue to melt into him, though I know I am
disappearing from view, like a daft bunny at the end of a shimmering
field.
Ecco la primavera -- I am still here, just. And I do not regret him,
Winter. We are connected so deeply, you see, and since when did youth go
wild with self-protection?
Spring to new beginnings
Send nostalgia to the dogs
Wild horses could not drag me back
To those romantic fogs
Of masochistic memories
Old photographs and songs
Of 'weren't we happy then, dear
And 'where did we go wrong?'
That was then, and this is now, dear,
I will buy posh strappy shoes
And Chablis, fruit and hampers,
Pack a picnic of the new.

TERRORISM has been much in the news lately, but sadly we have all
become used to that. The stories and pictures shock us much less than
they used to, unless we are personally involved.
But it is high time we became more concerned about terrorism. It is
dangerous to take it for granted, as we have by no means yet seen the
full potential of this dreadful weapon. We will have to reconsider our
attitude to it as a crime.
Historically, the worst crime in almost any country is that of murder.
It attracts the death penalty in many countries still, and elsewhere
usually results in ''life'' imprisonment, however that is defined. The
reality of most murders, however, is that the attacker is known to the
victim and that drink or drugs are very often involved. The victim may
be killed for personal reasons, or in the course of a robbery, so there
is almost always some link, however tenuous, between murderer and
victim.
This is where the vital difference between murder and terrorism can be
seen. Terrorism often involves murder but this is, by definition, murder
of people totally unconnected with the murderers or their cause. It is
indeed worse than this, because it is not a case of innocent people
being accidentally caught in ''crossfire'' -- they are actually targeted
for killing particularly because they are unconnected.
The murder of innocents, especially but not exclusively women and
children, makes bigger headlines. It also, of course, makes it virtually
impossible to protect us all from these attacks. No-one can organise
protection for people whose location and identity are unknown.
At the moment we have to live with these horrors because we have no
answer to the weapon of terrorism -- but for how long will society in
the free world accept this?
I suspect that as long as it remains on the present scale, it will be
judged to be tolerable when the costs and difficulties of pre-empting
terrorism are considered. If the stakes were raised, however, there
would quickly be a change in attitude.
If the Tokyo subway nerve gas attack had killed, say, 5000, as it
could well have done, or if someone explodes even a tiny nuclear bomb in
a city centre, current precautions such as they are would be judged to
be quite inadequate. What further actions could we take to prevent or
deter such attacks?
Prevention is very difficult for the reasons I have given, but any
attempt to do so would mean an enormous restriction on normal freedoms.
I doubt, even so, if they would be very effective.
As regards deterrence, it would clearly have to start with the penalty
for murder, either death by execution or life imprisonment, according to
which country the offence had taken place. But public opinion would
demand more than a life sentence where there is no death penalty.
I believe we would have to address the question of how to add to a
''life'' sentence additional penalties to apply after the life prisoner
is released from prison. Perhaps a convicted terrorist should never
regain his full civic rights.
He could be denied a right to hold any public office or any position
in business. He could be refused a driving licence or a licence for any
vehicle, or perhaps for a hotel or public house or many other similar
privileges. He might also never again be granted a passport.
In short, society would literally outlaw the convicted terrorist who
would be allowed to live out his life with the basic essentials but no
social rights from the society he had once tried to destroy.
Such measures would be pretty draconian by our free and liberal way of
thinking, and, as of now, most of us would recoil from anything so
drastic. But I think the implications of unrestricted and well-funded
terrorism based on lethal weaponry are so far-reaching that sooner or
later we will be forced in sheer self-defence to face up to some pretty
unpalatable options.
I only hope that someone, somewhere, is thinking about these issues,
because if, or when, they hit us we cannot expect much prior warning.

An advertising campaign employing female sexual imagery to deter men
from rape is about to be launched. Jean West highlights its absurdity
LAST Saturday morning there was no milk in the fridge. It was 9.30am.
I was hungover -- I looked like I'd been wrestling the cat. My hair was
stuck up in a feather duster coiffure, my eyes were puffy, and a huge
crease like a deep scar ran over my face from hugging the pillow. I was
desperate for a cup of tea, and, as it was the weekend, a bowl or two of
Sugar Puffs. I'd tried eating them raw but it was torture. My partner
was snoring. It looked like it was my turn to go to the shop. Throwing
on some paint-stained old jeans used for cleaning up and a shapeless
jumper, sockless in my ripped sneakers, I thought if I made a dash for
it I wouldn't bump into anyone. I could be a slob and no-one would
notice me.
I looked rough; in fact, it was hard to distinguish whether I was
male, female, or werewolf for that matter. But workmen are not easily
fooled. As I turned the corner at the bottom of my street, I heard the
words ''Give us a kiss'' proferred by a dusty, scruffy-looking brickie,
far better dressed, I might add, than me. His have-a-go mate then piped
up: ''Can I have one too?''
I was furious to find their words accelerating my step. I was out of
breath when I reached the shop and I had to pass them a second time on
the way back. Then I thought: ''I suppose these are the polite ones; at
least they asked?''
Some men don't need much excuse to stir their sexual organs into
arousal. I was female -- fair game, fair competition. What, I wondered,
if I had wandered down past them in a Wonderbra and shouted ''Hello
Boys!'' What of their restraint then?
I would have liked to have believed the assurances of Trevor Beattie
of London's TBWA ad agency -- of the brazier ad fame -- that I would
have felt empowered and proud of my sexuality. Indeed, it would have
been a lot more practical for me not to have bothered dressing before I
went out. It was a lovely day, after all. But would I have felt in a
position of strength and sexy? I don't think so!
The thought of half a dozen workmen slavering over my bare skin is not
quite the stuff of raw orgasm. Vomit is about the only physical faculty
I could have mustered. It is with laughable disbelief, therefore, that
Mr Beattie expects support from women's organisations, like Zero
Tolerance and Rape Crisis, for his latest project without some
criticism.
On the back of a move by TBWA's sister company in America, Chiat Day,
the young entrepreneur has made the realm of rape his business. There,
director Charles Hall has come under fire for his use of overtly sexual
imagery to tackle the subject in a controversial campaign. His move was
a knee-jerk, one-man-band reaction to the rape of a close friend.
Close-up shots of women's breasts, bums, and even crotches, with the
words ''This Is Not An Invitation To Rape Me'' aims, he says, to show
women are not commodities to be grabbed, owned, and screwed. They are
human beings with as much right to choose how they exercise their sexual
organs as anyone else. Magnanimous, hey?
What at first worried Evelyn Gillan, creative director of Zero
Tolerance, apart from the obvious, was a comment made by Mr Hall -- who
has become, with Beattie, something of a superstar -- in the Guardian
last week.
He said that the sexy images were ''an attempt to draw in men,
inviting them to look closely before dealing them the blow'' -- by
titilation, in other words; by pandering to their fantasies and by
posing women as potential victims.
In the same interview, Mr Beattie said: ''Some feminists believe these
images turn women into sex objects.'' (Would a picture of a fat mother
of four, all lumps and bumps of cellulite have been used by these
marketing men?) He added: ''But these are images from women's magazines,
images that are already out there. They are not how men portray women,
but how women portray themselves. These ads do not reinforce a
stereotype but upturn it. The point is, if someone is dressed this way,
no man has the right to rape her.''
Despite this, Beattie has played down the imagery for the UK -- a
strange move -- driven, one suspects, by the scores of complaints to his
American sidekick and the 115 to the advertising watchdog about the
Wonderbra posters. He hopes to cause less offence using blander
pictures; for example, a shot of newly-weds, not resisting though, the
obligatory bosom shot.
It is understood he has expressed interest in joining forces with Zero
Tolerance -- started in Scotland in 1992 and now employed across Britain
and as far afield as the state of South Australia. Even cult author
Irvine Welsh has adopted the initiative to conclude his new book,
Marabou Stork Nightmares, such has been its impact.
Zero Tolerance was unique in that it took the glamour and horror-film
sensationalism away from rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence.
Adverts did not go for sexy, lithe, long-legged females to get across
the facts. They used everyday images: two little girls playing with
their toys in their bedroom with the words: ''By the time they reach 18
one of them will have been subjected to sexual abuse.'' Or a picture of
a granny and her granddaughter and the line: ''From 3 to 93 women are
raped.''
All these ordinary pictures of women aimed to dispel the myths that
women who wander the street alone are the main victims of rape. They
wanted to show they were more at risk from someone they know, in bigger
danger in the home not from sex monsters, beasts and perverts, but from
boyfriends, husbands, fathers, next-door neighbours.
This campaign deliberately eschewed material later adopted in a
Scottish Office drive, zooming in on battered women's faces, women
reduced to no more than victims, helpless and passive.
Gillan said: ''I think it's important to challenge the view expressed
by these advertising executives that the use of sexual imagery 'does not
reinforce overtly sexual stereotypes of women but upturns them'.
''Their fundamental misunderstanding of the issues has led them down a
wholly irresponsible creative path which is depressingly predictable. It
serves to confirm that the advertising industry has two standard
creative responses on the issue of male violence against women. When
bruised, battered and bloody faces fail, the admen wheel out that
reliable old chestnut, sex.''
She added: ''The creative path Zero Tolerance chose, on the other
hand, deliberately challenged men and empowered women. It has been
braver and more imaginative in this respect.
''In the wake of this move towards naming the problem, not through
battered, beaten faces or by confusing the issue with further sexual
reference, the American campaign can only prove a retrograde step. These
men display a supreme arrogance in their approach.''
Shocking statistics were used too in Zero Tolerance, such as the fact
that more than one in five women are raped by their husband or partner.
Or that 82% of abusers are known to their victims and 19% are relatives.
The facts speak the plain truth -- they needn't be enhanced with
prurient graphics.
So, with phase two of Zero Tolerance's campaign just launched, in the
same month as Beattie's kicks-off, are we to believe the man really
cares or is this some self-centred publicity stunt?
Let the campaigns speak for themselves.

DR ORWELL AND MR BLAIR. David Caute (Phoenix, #5.99)
* THOSE readers who have found other accounts on the personality of
the author of Animal Farm and 1984 somewhat off-putting -- and there was
much about George Orwell/Eric Blair to put people off -- may take a
kinder and perhaps truer view of the crotchety Old Etonian from reading
this gentle and touching pseudo-biographical fiction. Fragments from
seven years of his life (1943-1950) are seen through the eyes of a
12-year-old boy living on a farm near which Orwell is writing Animal
Farm, and the quirky friendship that grows between them shows Orwell --
who speaks largely in the words of his essays -- in a kinder, more human
light than he ever managed to shine on himself.
THE REPUBLIC OF WHORES. Josef Skvorecky (Faber, #6.99).
* Being the Schweik-like adventures of the noted Czech dissident and
humorist's unsoldierly soldier Danny Smiricky -- commander of a Czech
tank in the Cold War and doughty champion of the socialist cause against
the threat from the bourgeois warmongers of the West, at least while his
officers are within earshot. Combining rough Rabelaisian barrack-room
humour with hilarious satire upon the insanities of the old Eastern Bloc
communist system, Skvorecky defies the gloomy image that attaches to
modern European writing and creates a truly laugh-out-loud funny book
whose hero is nothing less than the Sergeant Bilko of the Warsaw Pact.
AGAINST ALL HOPE: Resistance In The Nazi Concentration Camps
1938-1945. Hermann Langbein (Constable, #12.95).
* Despite much evidence to the contrary -- not least that of plain
common sense -- it seems always to be assumed that the Holocaust took
place without serious resistance on the part of its victims. Although
not in itself a malicious notion, there is something patronising if not
actually dehumanising about this idea of millions sleepwalking
fatalistically towards their deaths, and Hermann Langbein -- himself a
survivor of Dachau and Auschwitz -- nails it firmly in this
comprehensive account of the organised and frequently violent struggle
against the Nazis by almost all categories of prisoner in the death
factories. Painful and pitiful reading, but uplifting and heartening
too.
FLICKERS: An Illustrated Celebration Of 100 Years Of Cinema. Gilbert
Adair (Faber, #14.99).
* Taking a single film still for each year of cinema's life, from
1895's Workers Leaving The Lumiere Factory to 1994's Ed Wood, the
elegant post-modernist critic Gilbert Adair weaves around these luminous
phantoms a web of miniature essays, not only on the films themselves,
but on cinema itself and life and everything. His choice of milestones
along the road to the present is provocative but not precious -- for
every Celine And Julie Go Boating there's an Unforgiven or The Nutty
Professor -- and his style is light-hearted, discursive, funny, and fond
-- the very highest kind of camp.
THE MEXICAN TREE DUCK. James Crumley (Picador, #5.99).
* Up in Montana, where the wheat stretches all the way to the edge of
the sky, a man's gotta do what he's gotta do as much as if he were in
Bay City, and the smalltown streets down which a private eye must go are
every bit as mean. James Crumley's latest adventure of Vietnam-veteran
private eye C W Sughrue is the usual rambling but fascinating shaggy-dog
story of murder and bad craziness in the boondocks. It is full of
mordant reflections and insights about America and the way it's going:
as in all Crumley's books, the real case under investigation is the
death of the kinder, gentler America he used to know. And C W Sughrue's
a great guy with whom to go looking for clues.

Catherine Brown argues that Scottish farmers should be stressing the
quality of their products.
I CAN pick from a number of tags which suggest that this supermarket
sirloin steak might be worth treble the price of common mince. But which
one to choose -- Aberdeen Angus, Selected Aberdeeshire, Angus, or just
Specially Selected Scotch Beef? One is too pink with hardly any fat
marbling so that could be dodgy. Another looks wet -- why pay a premium
price for water? There is only one which looks dark enough to have hung
for longer than the minimum seven days, which the Meat and Livestock
Commission recommends will produce good eating quality in a steak. In
the end I buy all four and go home for a steak-tasting.
They are grilled rare, unseasoned, and the four tasters, aged from 17
to 60, are hard put to find much difference between them. They are
certainly all tender, some more succulent than others. But flavourwise
even the dark, well-hung-looking ''Angus'' (M &amp; S, #6.99lb) rates little
higher than the cheaper pinker ''Selected Aberdeenshire'' (Tesco,
#5.68). Of the other two, which come from Safeway, the ''Specially
Selected Scotch Beef'' in a pre-pack (#5.08) rates only marginally
better than the ''Aberdeen Angus'' which comes from a butcher's counter
at a discount price (#4.78).
None are outstandingly bad. Yet none, the tasters agree, rock them
with brilliant flavours. Twelve hours in a spicy marinade would improve
the flavour, but quality Scotch beef shouldn't need that sort of
treatment.
Perhaps Safeway's chairman, Sir Alistair Grant, was right then when he
reported recently to the Agricultural Scottish Affairs Committee that he
thinks native beef breeding has taken a wrong turn in the last decade.
''The intermingling of French breeding stock, particularly Charolais,
has produced a beef type which is not particularly Scottish.'' he says.
''Over a long period we could attend to that, so that we produced a
Scottish breed which has been adapted to produce a slightly larger
animal, but at the same time retains the native characteristics of good
fat-marbling for flavour. Then we could have the best of both worlds.''
The problem developed, he admits, about 20 years ago as a result of
the first customers for supermarket beef who wanted lean, pink,
fresh-looking beef. The movement back to breeding native cattle with
more fat and flavour is one, he believes, which has momentum. He has
just bought his own first pedigree Aberdeen Angus heifer.
Of course farmers like Michael Gibson of Forres, who also reported to
the Scottish Affairs Committee as Highland Chairman of the Agricultural
Committee of the Scottish Landowners' Association, regard with some
irony this back-tracking to native breeds in the search for quality
beef. As do our friendly, neighbourhood, traditional butchers, who have
always kept their eye on the native breed's ability to produce quality
flavour rather than quantity, tasteless (and cheap) lean meat.
''Ten years ago,'' says Gibson, who also owns MacBeth's butchers in
Forres, ''we wanted to do a presentation on the quality image of
pedigree Highland beef at a farming exhibition in Hyde Park and were
warned off because we were seen as old- fashioned.
''All we wanted to do was get across the point that small native
Scottish breeds which forage naturally on Scottish mountains produce top
quality beef. But that was out of step with the MLC line at that time.''
Both Grant and Gibson are in agreement now, however, on the need to
protect native breeds. Grant wonders what would happen to the image of
Scotch whisky if it was discovered that it was being mixed with French
brandy.
Throwing another argument into the ring is Colin Smith, Tesco's
commercial director, who reported to the Scottish Affairs Committee that
while Scottish beef still enjoys an undeniable demand, the breed is far
less important than the treatment of the animal before and after
slaughter.
Scientifically this gets the backing of the MLC, whose research work,
done throughout the world, on the eating quality of beef has produced a
blueprint for treatment before and after slaughter.
What the blueprint does not provide, however, is any sort of guide as
to what farmers should do on the question of breeding.
''Quality differences between beef breeds,'' says Basil Lowman, senior
beef specialist at the Scottish Agricultural College, ''cannot be
supported by scientific evidence, so it's really up to the farmer to
decide what to go for. I think they have been confused by the messages
which have been coming from consumers.
''Of course there are as many arguments as their are farmers, but it
seems to me,'' says Lowman, ''that there has been some damage to the
perceived quality image of Aberdeen Angus beef by the trend towards
fresh, pink, lean beef. I think farmers need to take much more interest
in the finished product and its eating quality.''
So instead of the supermarket coming along with news that what their
customers want is immature, lean, pink beef with no fat, the boot should
be on the other foot.
If the farmer has a supply of meat which comes from predominantly
native breeds he should be making a noise about it, striking deals with
retailers based on his quality product.
Then perhaps we can believe that the Scotch tag -- of whatever
permutation -- always means tender, succulent, flavour-rocking steaks
worth their premium price.

As the football season reaches its climax today
NEIL ALEXANDER considers one loyal group of Rangers fans who have
never seen their heroes play
THERE can't be many people on the South Side, or indeed in the whole
of Glasgow, who are not aware that Rangers are champions again -- for
the seventh year running. Almost everyone will have seen the ground, and
many will have seen the team play.
However, there is one group of about 50 loyal (some would say
fanatical) supporters who attend every home match, sitting by the
tunnel, and yet have never seen any of their heroes play. They have
never even seen the magnificent stadium that they sit in every week,
because they are blind.
The Rangers Blind Party, as they are known, sit in the Main Stand just
behind the dugout, and are some of the most vocal supporters at Ibrox.
They have their own sighted commentator who shouts a ball-by-ball
coverage at them, and there have even been complaints -- from sighted
supporters sitting behind the Blind Party -- about the somewhat
colourful language used by some of them.
Blind and visually-impaired football supporters throughout Scotland
owe their weekly visits to their favourite clubs to Rex Kingsley, who
worked for the BBC and was a sports writer for the Sunday Mail. Rex
founded the original blind parties in 1937, and the organisation now
bears his name. The Rex Blind Party.
Most of the bigger clubs in Scotland have blind supporters, and the
Rex organises commentators at Rangers, Celtic, Partick Thistle, Falkirk,
Hibs, Hearts, Dundee and Dundee United, Aberdeen, Kilmarnock, and
Clydebank.
Davy Tanner, chairman of the Rangers Blind Party and the Rex Blind
Party, has been involved for as long as he can remember, and did his
first commentary at the age of six: ''Both my parents were blind, and my
dad used to take me to Ibrox every week. One week the sighted
commentator didn't turn up, so I did the commentary while sitting on
Dad's shoulders.''
There is no maximum or minimum age for membership -- and the group has
members from 11 to 85. Tanner said: ''We have one member, Drew Herbison,
who is totally blind and travels down from the Black Isle, north of
Inverness. He comes down for most home games. We also have supporters
from Ayrshire, Dumbarton, Edinburgh, and Grangemouth. In fact, they're
just like the ordinary sighted fanatics in that they will travel almost
anywhere to support their team.''
The style and content of the commentary is very important. ''The thing
about commentating for the blind is that you have to keep up with play.
There's nothing more frustrating than when you hear Archie McPherson or
one of the other commentators say 'Goal!' and you don't know whether
it's in your goal or the other goal.''
The secret, according to Davy Tanner, is speed: ''The blind supporters
like a fast-moving up-to-date commentary, and they also like a biased
commentary. For example, the other week I said the referee had given
Rangers a free kick just outside the penalty box, and added that I
didn't think it was a free kick. One of the younger blind supporters
answered: ''It looked more like a penalty to me!''
Rangers provides the 50 seats free, and access for the Blind Party and
ambulatory disabled supporters was considered when the stadium was made
all-seater to comply with the recommendations of the Taylor Report.
Tanner said the Blind Party's seats are situated in an area where they
will be safe if any missiles are thrown, and where they could be
evacuated quickly from the ground by security personnel if there was an
emergency.
However, the wall of noise which surrounds the Blind Party has made it
increasingly difficult for them to hear the commentary, and they are in
the process of raising funds for an audio-assisted broadcast system, so
members will have an ear-piece through which they can hear the
commentator.
Davy Tanner said: ''This system will mean we will no longer have to
choose the commentators with the loudest voices. The commentator will
still be at the game with them, but they won't have to shout.''
Rangers supporters clubs heard about the scheme and have already
raised about #2500 to pay for the equipment, although the Blind Party
have not yet made an official request for help with fund raising.
Because of the help of all those involved with the Blind Party, it
looks as if Rangers' visually impaired and blind supporters will
continue to watch their team play from the seats by the tunnel for many
seasons to come.

YEARS ago the neighbouring towns of Girvan and Maybole had a fierce
but friendly rivalry. Girvan folk were called the ''Hungry Ciboes'',
probably because they were so poor they ate a lot of scallions. The main
industry in Maybole was boot-making, and the locals were known as
''Tacketies''. The townsfolk nurtured, preserved, and took pride in
their local identities. The same thing no doubt applied all over rural
Scotland.
I suspect that life used to be more colourful and have a richer
flavour than in the anonymous nineties. I also suspect that many of our
sociological troubles arise from a lack of individual identities, town,
family, occupation, religion, even football team support. People move to
indeterminate housing areas in anonymous cities, to indeterminate
occupations (or none). They eat in anonymous fast-food restaurants, shop
in chain stores, holiday in anonymous foreign hotels where they scarcely
touch the foreigners or their culture. We are in great danger of
becoming grey people in a grey world.
Too fierce a local patriotism can of course lead to arrogance and
intolerance, ''Wha's like us'', or the campaign against the ''White
Settlers''. The adequate person has a strong sense of identity, but can
appreciate and enjoy others different identity.
I like foreigners because I get bored with my own sort. In Tokyo I
take off my shoes and eat with chopsticks, drink communal Kava with
Fijians, sail on Dutch canals, take scalps in America. Vive la
difference! Cultural diversity is a treasure we must preserve. Mix all
the colours in the paint box and you get khaki. Who wants to live in a
boring homogenised world?
But nationalism can be ugly and dangerous. Most wars have been between
nation states. The well-focused identities of Serb, Croat, and Muslim in
the former Yugoslavia has been a source of great grief. If you preserve
national identities must you risk strife? I think it is possible to
lobotomise the bad bits of nationalism in a simple manner which I do not
think has been widely recognised -- I refer to free trade.
Does this sound simplistic? Well consider what free trade involves;
the free movement of people, goods, money, and services across national
boundaries. Fine for the growth of trade you may think, but it goes much
further, for what free trade does is to weld the economies of
participating countries together, with scarcely any effect on their
intrinsic political and cultural integrity (political integration is
totally different). The unique national characters are preserved,
perhaps even intensified. Against this argument, things like
metrication, for instance, destroyed our traditional weights and
measures, but sacrificing our nonconformity produced a clear balance of
advantage.
MORE people will cross borders. Will they submerge the indigenous
culture? I think not, I suspect the people who are keen to preserve
their cultural heritage are those who enjoy cultural diversity. The ones
who hate and fear foreigners have a low cultural identity.
The mainspring of nation state trade and bullet wars can be removed at
a stroke. Most quarrels are mainly for economic advantage, or for
national/cultural preservation. In a free-trade area, war will severely
threaten a nation's economic self-interest, and a larger country which
has free economic access to a smaller has no need to try to swallow it
politically. Deodorised nation states, benign as neutered butterflies,
are no threat to each other, and non threatening nationalisms can
proliferate, even sub-divide, without contradicting economic logic or
producing dissonance and conflict.
What then of the new free trade areas in North America, Asia, and
Europe? If they are staging posts for an eventual free trading world,
then they are good; if they are new superpowers in the making, I think
they are bad. On what premise do we assume that future superpowers will
not go to war?
Meantime, like all exclusive clubs they exist, not for reasons of
international altruism, but to confer favours upon their members, and to
exclude non-members, often from the Third World, impoverished Eastern
Europe, or Newly Industrialised Countries (NICs). This I think is bad,
not to say racist. The new single markets, still pecking their way out
of their shells, already look protectionish. If they now work together
with the new World Trade Authority to reduce world tariffs, the worst
effects can be mitigated.
If the EU, the Americas bloc and the Asian bloc amalgamate politically
into new superstates, who can doubt but that they will put perceived
area interest above world interest. I foresee the seeds of future global
rivalry and conflict, the old nation state wars but writ larger.
Alternatively, they may collapse like the red giant USSR superstar, in a
supernova of civil wars and chaos.
If they stop at economic integration, spreading the free trading area
ever wider, preserving vital national cultural essences, avoiding the
bureaucratic and arthritic penalties of bigness, the frightening danger
of the emergence of new superpowers then the highly desirable goal of a
global single market is possible, a peaceful, prosperous, economically
integrated world.
I believe in the brotherhood of man, but brothers live separate lives
in separate families. I also get on well with the neighbours, but have
no plans to knock the houses together. That way lies conflict and
discomfort.

A TEAM of scientists are hoping, by genetic alteration, to develop a
new strain of potato that will not turn brown when it is fried.
Between eight and 10 scientists are working on the problem at the
Scottish Crop Research Institute at Invergowrie, near Dundee. They are
being financed by a grant of #250,000 from an EU fund designed to
promote research into farming and food technology.
Another #250,000 is being contributed by UK and European crisp
manufacturers.
The goal is to develop a potato that can be kept at low temperatures
without its starch being naturally converted to sugars such as glucose,
which makes crisps too brown when they are fried.
This effect can be halted by storing the potatoes at above 40[DEG]F.
But problem then is that the tubers think winter is over and spring is
on its way, and they start sprouting naturally.
At present crisp-makers use a spray of chemicals to halt this growth,
but Golden Wonder, Smiths, and other firms would prefer to present a
''greener'' image to the buying public.
The idea of targeting the potatoes' genes came from an earlier study
involving scientists in Germany, Holland, and Denmark as well as
Scotland.
But the Scottish scientists have won the contest to take the study one
stage further and do actual trials on the ''clone'' tatties produced so
far.

CUTE kids in the movies -- especially cute endangered kids in the
movies -- tend to bring Couch Potato out in a nasty attack of Anne Frank
Syndrome. You don't know about Anne Frank Syndrome? Well, it's a
condition whereby cinematic exposure to unsympathetic tots in peril
causes the viewer to start rooting for the bad guys (Yea, Richard III!
Give those little princes hell!) instead of the white hats.
The name is derived from a long-ago off-Broadway dramatisation of The
Diary of Anne Frank, in which -- so the story goes -- the girl who
played Anne Frank was such a gloriously, epically lousy actress that,
when the Gestapo entered stage left to search the Dutch hiding place for
Anne and her family, some anonymous critic in the cheap seats yelled
She's in the attic!, thereby bringing the proceedings to an early
conclusion.
You can't do that with video or cinema productions, unfortunately --
this may come as a shock, but the people on the screen can't actually
hear you. Fortunately, there is no call for such drastic interjections
in the kid thriller The Client (rental, cert 15), veteran heartwringer
Joel Schumacher's swift and streamlined adaptation of John Grisham's
witness-in-peril blockbuster (minus the more obscure complications of
Grisham's original plot) about an 11-year-old boy who accidentally
witnesses the confession and suicide of a corrupt Mob lawyer, and
therefore becomes a person of great interest to both the Mafia and the
FBI, neither of whom really has the kid's best interests at heart.
Young Brad Renfro makes an unusually likeable pre-teen hero, neither
nauseatingly sweet nor unpleasantly coarse as Hollywood kids tend to be,
and you can see in him the qualities of honesty, guts and moxie that
make his lawyer Susan Sarandon (does that woman get better as she gets
older, or what?) so much more than professionally determined to keep him
from being wasted by the bad guys -- led by Anthony LaPaglia, owner of
the best sneer in the movies today -- or endangered by the Feds.
Joel Schumacher, who directed Ghost among other things, juggles
suspense, action, pathos and comedy to great effect in what is as
effective a thriller as we've seen this year.
You won't remember it for longer than 15 minutes, but you'll enjoy it
while it's on.
Roger Avary, co-writer with Quentin Tarantino of the truly humungous
Pulp Fiction, shows what he can do on his own in Killing Zoe (rental,
cert 18), a Paris-set caper thriller in which -- how original -- a bank
robbery goes all wrong when some of the boys lose their cool and start
shooting anything that moves. Hey, Roger: ever see a movie called
Reservoir Dogs?
Unfortunately, the scenario is about the only close resemblance
between this gory stick-'em-up and Tarantino's mobster masterpiece: all
the things that make the latter memorable, such as crisp dialogue,
characterisation, humour and restraint (yes, restraint) are posted
missing here. Safecracker Eric Stoltz, big boss Jean-Hugues Anglade, and
hostage hooker Julie Delpy do their best to give Avary's script the
wacky resonance of Dogs, but to small avail: Killing Zoe is simply
violent, clumsy, and dull, interesting only as proving that there's much
more to the popularity of Tarantino's films than just a cheerful
attitude to violence. If Avary doesn't want to go down in the film
guides as merely the Kenneth Halliwell to Tarantino's Joe Orton, he'll
have to do better than this.

Children's novels shortlisted for this year's Carnegie Medal deal with
some hard-hitting subjects, reports Jennifer Cunningham
IT IS one of the few literary prizes which does not mean fame and
fortune. Appropriately for a children's author, the winner of the
Carnegie Medal receives just that -- a dazzling, round, golden medal.
There is also #1000 worth of books -- to be donated to an organisation
of the winner's choice.
Dubbed ''The Booker of the Playground'', the award can be as
controversial as the grown-up version. Last year's winner, Stone Cold,
by Robert Swindell -- the tale of a homeless teenager in danger from a
serial killer -- provoked uproar among the nannying tendency.
The book was prompted by Sir George Young's famous definition that the
homeless were the people you tripped over coming out of the opera. To
research his subject, Swindell lived on the streets for several days --
albeit with the precaution of having his credit card in his back pocket
and phone numbers he could ring if in real trouble.
He discovered that to appear homeless was to be treated with complete
contempt. The authenticity imbued the book with conscience-pricking
powers among readers of all ages. At least one of last year's judges now
buys The Big Issue more regularly.
This year's winner -- to be announced on July 12 -- could be just as
contentious. There are well-established and new authors among the eight
on the shortlist, which are all fiction, and they do not shrink from
war, murder supernatural evil, moral dilemmas or, once again,
homelessness.
With an age range of eight to 14 plus, and subject matter ranging from
Arthurian Britain and the Middle East to a parallel alien world, judging
is no easy task.
Strathkelvin District Council's youth librarian, Margaret Bell, is the
co-ordinator of the judging panel. The 13 judges are all librarians,
regional representatives of the youth library association, plus the
president as chairman. They are no literary high-fliers settling old
scores or pursuing their private causes, but the two-day shortlisting
meeting and final selection unleash fierce passions and much heated
debate.
The Carnegie Medal, instituted by the Library Association in 1935 for
''an outstanding book for children written in English'' published during
the preceding year, is the oldest children's book prize. The Kate
Greenaway Medal, awarded since 1956 for distinguished illustration, is
decided by the same panel.
Both shortlists are particularly strong this year. Among the
best-known writers selected for the Carnegie, which can be awarded to
previous winners, are Lynne Reid Banks, Berlie Doherty, Michael
Morpurgo, and Robert Westall. A difficulty for Margaret Bell is that
among them is a Strathkelvin colleague, Theresa Breslin, who has rapidly
established herself a reputation as a wide-ranging children's author.
''I can't favour her book, Whispers in the Graveyard. It is excellent,
but so are the others,'' said Margaret.
With children's fiction no longer shy of conflict and terror, picture
books are shaking off their safe, nursery image. The eight on this
year's list include two for the over-10s, both packed with challenging,
sophisticated images. Gregory Rogers's illustrations for Way Home, by
Libby Hathorn, evoke black and white press picture images in a sharp
illustration of another homeless tale of the triumph of human spirit.
Anthony Browne's King Kong takes a new look at the film, and in a
style which dips from the graphic to the surreal to challenge previous
perceptions: who are the real victims? When he won two years ago with
Gorilla, he gave his prize books to the Born Free foundation. A library
threatened with closure in Sheffield received Berlie Docherty's prize in
a bid to keep it open. Anne Fine, who won with Flour Babies, had her
#1000 worth of books transcribed into braille for a school for the
blind.
The judges' task becomes more difficult every year. Margaret Bell
recalls that when she became a librarian 20 years ago, 7000 new books
were published every year in the UK; now there are 7000 for children
alone. Nominations for the medals, which must be from librarians, have
also increased, particularly in the past few years.
Being a judge is a distinctly onerous honour. For seven weeks they do
little else except read children's books -- a total of 99 this year.
''At the end of their two-year stint most judges are sorry because they
like being in at the kill, but there is great relief that they do not
need to read all these books next year,'' said Bell.
''We want them to be opinionated and people do have very strong views.
Two of the judges were very disappointed at the last meeting because
they were very keen on two books which the rest did not like. You do get
someone saying: 'I cannot believe that you are going to vote for
this'.''

THE tiny group of lottery winners are far outweighed by a vast army of
losers. The odds show that the huge proportion of players in this game
of chance will never recoup their initial outlay.
But this takes no account of the starving refugees in Third World
countries who will suffer because charities' donations are down; the
medical research charities which have been ruled out by the grant-giving
National Lottery Charities Board; the local corner shops whose customers
are going to supermarkets to buy a ticket and, since they are there
anyway, buy the rest of their groceries; and even the cinemas.
Scottish charities report takings down 16% since November -- the
plight of a centre for sufferers of multiple sclerosis in Maryhill,
Glasgow, which is having problems paying its staff because collecting
cans are coming back empty, is only one charity highlighted in The
Herald.
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts finds that with fewer people
playing football pools, the pools companies have less money for charity.
Mr Gratton Endicott, secretary to the trustees of the FSA, said that
while it had #70m to give out last year, this year's figure is expected
to be 17% lower.
The victims are usually the smaller charities or organisations --
those not entitled to lottery hand-outs and which have now been deprived
of their previous source of income from pools-generated grants. But
there have been other losers:
* The Cinema Exhibitors Association, which represents chains such as
Odeon, MGM, UCI and Warners, said that audience figures for the first
quarter of the year are 20% lower than the same period last year;
* Littlewoods in Hillington has already cut 90 jobs, although the
company claims to be turning the corner competitively and winning back
the 15% of business it has lost; * Financial markets believe the lottery
is responsible for continuing sluggish sales in the retail trade.
Analysts say that #100m a week is disappearing into the lottery -- money
that would otherwise have been spent in shops;
Slowly, however, public opinion is turning towards the church's
viewpoint that this latest form of gambling is causing incalculable
damage to society, and particularly to the unemployed and desperate, the
very people who can least afford lottery losses.
The Rev Bill Wallace, convener of the Church of Scotland board of
social responsibility, believes Britain is following in the wake of
other countries which have found large prize jackpots attracting mainly
punters from low-income brackets.
Scratch cards are causing particular concern, he said, because as soon
as someone has one win, he or she buys more tickets. ''The Irish
experience indicates that if you are unemployed, you are four times more
likely to buy a lottery ticket.''
People who are down and desperate to get out of their situation are
the people who spend money they can ill afford, sometimes at the expense
of household essentials, in the forlorn hope of escape.
''When the State starts to encourage greed and covetousness and to
exploit people's despair it is a sad day for society,'' he said. ''Even
if it does settle down, it will take an awful shift to get it to stop.''
The lottery has already produced the tragedy of one suicide -- a man
who bought a ticket using the same numbers every week but forgot to buy
one the week they came up.
Gamblers' Anonymous says its English branches, over the past three to
four months, have had 20% more calls than normal.
A spokesman said that calls referred almost entirely to scratch cards,
which seem more addictive than the weekly draw. Gamblers' Anonymous
meetings are also beginning to see people turning up who admit that,
while they gambled compulsively in the past, their addiction has now got
out of hand.
''The existence of another form of gambling generally available is
going to mean there will be more casualties of compulsive gambling than
there were before. It does reinforce something we have been saying for
years -- that the public is not made aware enough that gambling is not
totally harmless.'' Last, but not least, there are the Scots who failed
to claim #1.6m of prizes -- they lost too.

A VOYEUR who shot a farmer as he had sex with his son's teenage
girlfriend was yesterday jailed for seven years.
Philip Somerville, 32, was convicted of attempting to murder the
45-year-old farmer while he made love to the 19-year-old woman in his
car in a secluded lane.
Somerville, a married man who is unemployed, fired two close-range
shots at the car. He was cleared of attempting to murder the woman.
He was convicted of the single charge by a 10-2 majority last month at
Winchester Crown Court.
He was told by Mr Justice Tuckey passing sentence yesterday:
''Although I accept your original plan was to speak to the couple and
scare them off, in the event you went much further than that.
''You fired both barrels of your shotgun at close range, and if the
shot had not passed through a seat your victim would probably have been
killed.''
The court had heard how the shot ripped through the car's headrest
before hitting the farmer.
The farmer had told the court how he and the woman had driven to the
lane at Headley, near Basingstoke, Hampshire, for an early morning sex
session.
But after they had removed their clothes they noticed a man peering
through the window. When confronted he claimed he was looking for his
dog. Minutes later the man reappeared carrying a shotgun.
Before he had a chance to drive off, the farmer saw a flash of light
in his rear-view mirror and was showered with glass.
The woman ran to a nearby house where she raised the alarm.
The farmer was taken to Basingstoke District Hospital where he had
surgery to remove shotgun pellets.
He said he broke the news of his affair with the woman to his
22-year-old son when he came to visit him in hospital.
''My son was very surprised -- he didn't know what was going on,'' he
told the jury.
Somerville, of Headley, Hampshire, denied the attempted murder of the
lovers on September 24 last year.
He told police he ''got a buzz'' from sneaking up on courting couples
and startling them. But he claimed in court that he made the story up so
he would be released from the police station.
His counsel, Mr Dorian Lovell-Pank, had told the judge that Somerville
lived a ''quiet and unobtrusive life in the country with his wife and
children''.
He added: ''He is a country man, a temperate man who acted in a manner
that was wholly out of character and quite bizarre.''

A SHIP'S bell which tolled throughout the war is going ''home'' in a
unique ceremony this weekend -- to the island whose people have always
had a special affinity with a little patrol boat.
HMS Tiree, a former converted trawler which faced the dangers of the
North Atlantic in the notorious Murmansk runs as an armed patrol boat,
had always had links with the island of Tiree, its people regularly
providing the comfort of warm clothing and money for her wartime crews.
In the wake of the 50th anniversary celebrations of VE-Day, the bell
will be hallowed at a ceremony in Heylipol Church, dedicated by the Rev
Neil MacKinnon, with islanders and former sailors who served on the ship
taking part.
They include HMS Tiree's longest-serving commanding officer,
Lieutenant Commander Fred Stickland, who took the bridge during the
1950s.
It was he who asked a former shipmate, ex-leading seaman Allan
Snowden, a member of West Lothian branch of the Royal Naval Association,
to find a place for the bell he was presented with when the ship was
sold abroad 35 years ago.
Mr Snowden, now aged 70 and staying in Livingston, said yesterday:
''After rejecting thoughts of museums and the like, it was decided the
best place for it was the island after which the ship was named.''
He contacted the island's minister, and was delighted to learn that
following the ceremony on Sunday the bell would be placed in the lobby
of Tiree High School in an official hand-over, along with a document
explaining the ship's history, and the island's involvement with her.

EXCLUSIVE
THE Scottish Office was criticised yesterday by the vice convener of
Orkney Islands Council for refusing to publish a consultants' report
which advised against privatising Caledonian MacBrayne.
Mr Jim Sinclair said that this was a breach of commitments on open
government given by the Prime Minister to local authorities six months
ago.
He was reacting to The Herald's report yesterday that the Government
was refusing to publish the report from international accountants KPMG
which had cost the public purse more than #130,000.
Mr Sinclair said: ''We have been calling on the Government to publish
this report, because it studied ferries in Orkney and Shetland as well
as CalMac's operation on the west coast. But they are refusing to
publish it, because its findings on the success of the publicly owned
CalMac do not suit them politically.''
The refusal to publish was in direct contradiction to guidelines
issued in November by the Prime Minister on future relations between
central and local government, said Mr Sinclair.
Section D3 of these guidelines said: ''Where Government consultation
is founded upon consultants' or research reports or other external
evidence, where practicable, such reports, or at least summaries of such
reports and evidence (but not advice based on them) shall be made
available to the Associations (of local authorities) to inform their
deliberations.''
Mr Sinclair said that these commitments clearly applied to the KPMG
report -- which should be published, even if the commercially sensitive
figures were taken out.
''The position is that the Government was looking to put CalMac routes
out to tender two years ago. They commissioned KPMG, at considerable
public expense, to look at ways of doing that.
''But, after they read KPMG's conclusions, they decided against it.
Now they are proposing to do exactly the same with lifeline services to
Orkney and Shetland -- put them out to tender.
''Not only do they refuse to show us what is in the KPMG report that
persuaded them against privatising CalMac, Government Ministers also
refuse to listen to what our views are on our ferry services. Local
input doesn't seem to interest them, but it is vitally important.
''Everybody up here is concerned that changes the Government has made
in the subsidy regime, removing subsidies from freight, will mean the
end of those firms like Orcargo which are competing with P&amp;O, who will
be left dictating to our island communities. That is why we need all the
information. That is why we need meetings with Ministers.''
A Scottish Office spokesman, however, said last night that, while it
was true that the Prime Minister had made these commitments on open
government, the crucial phrase in the relevant section was ''where
practicable''.
''The problem in the case of the KPMG report is that it contains a lot
of commercially sensitive information. This was made available to the
consultants by other shipping operators and by CalMac on the strict
understanding that it would not be made public.''

IN Northern Italy, the 1994 white wines from the Veneto and adjoining
regions have reached the shops and restaurants in flowing abundance. In
Scotland, well, there have been hints here and there that they exist,
but most outlets are still contentedly selling the 1993s, or even, if
nobody complains, the 1992s and 1991s.
Italian whites -- unless they are something as image-conscious as a
Gaja Chardonnay, the 1990 version of which continues to be hailed as
''stunningly drinkable'' -- should always be drunk young. That is the
whole purpose of their existence. Clean and fresh when they are first
bottled, they tire quickly, grow flat and stale, and within as little as
a couple of years may begin to turn yellow and give off that
unmistakably oxidised smell that is bad news when a wine waiter pours a
sample into your glass.
At one time, such repellent bottles seemed par for the course in
Scotland's Italian restaurants and they still turn up in places where
the stock of certain types of wine does not shift quickly enough. Basic
Orvieto and the fetchingly named Est! Est!! Est!!! -- a million litres
of which are produced each year -- used to be such regular culprits that
you began to wonder if they had ever been fresh at all.
Happily the chances of finding a good bottle of Orvieto are now much
higher, and Threshers have nipped ahead of some of their rivals by
importing a 1994 Campogrande from the extensive vineyards of Marchesi
Antinori, whose aristocratic expertise is doing for Umbria what it has
long done for Tuscany.
But if #4.99 seems too much to pay for what is deliberately,
traditionally, and enjoyably a fairly neutral wine, then try Barone
Felix Longo's 1993 Gewurztraminer from the Alto Adige, also on sale at
Threshers at the same price. This is Italy's geographically hybrid (and
most northern) region, also known as the Sudtirol because of its
closeness to the Austrian border, where many of the Italian wine
producers have Germanic names.
Just in case you think the grapes have been imported from Alsace --
which most of us regard as the home of Gewurztraminer -- the label
proudly points out that Tramin (otherwise known in Italy as Termeno) is
a village in the upper reaches of the River Adige, and that ''it is
here, in its home country, that Gewurztraminer excels to produce softly
aromatic, discretely spicy wine. full-bodied and silky, the wine's
typical fatness sharpened by good acidity''.
At 13% proof, this white is less discrete than is claimed. In fact it
is quite fat and spicy, as a good Gewurz should be. But, coming from the
steepness of the Dolomites, it is also vivacious, yet not overstated, as
some New World Gewurztraminers are. Its hint of lychees -- the classic
Gewurztraminer giveaway -- is gentle, and the bittersweet flavour goes
well with veal and chicken as well as freshwater fish.
Don't expect it, however, to have quite the firm, flowery precision of
a great Dopff &amp; Irion Gewurz. Alsace may not be where this wine
originated, but towns such as Colmar and Riquewihr have certainly
perfected the production -- though at an inevitably higher price. Barone
Longo's wine, not unexpectedly, has more in common with a really good
Gruner Veltliner, Austria's most famous white of which, by chance,
Threshers have been selling an excellent bargain price example at #2.99.

Interior designer Amanda Rosa thrives on tight deadlines. Her most
recent achievement includes, reports Lesley Duncan, the creation of a
suite at the Gleneagles decorated in a Rob Roy tartan theme
AMANDA ROSA got married last week. And had her picture in the front
page of The Herald, too, dressed in an outfit of her own design as she
picked her way over Argyllshire rocks to be ferried to Crinan with her
husband, the restaurateur and hotelier Ken McCulloch.
Two days later, the talented interior designer had reverted to
everyday life. In navy sweatshirt and red-and-white striped socks, she
dispensed morning tea and shortbread at One Devonshire Gardens in the
West End of Glasgow. This is her husband's hotel, which won Egon Ronay's
top accolade last year, and which her interior designs have helped to
make such a lauded establishment.
The most recent spotlight on Amanda Rosa's work has been, however, at
another of Scotland's premier hotels, Gleneagles in Perthshire. Here she
has designed the Rob Roy suite. The commission coincided with new
interest in the legendary Trossachs hero inspired by the Hollywood film
with Liam Neeson and Jessica Lange. Gleneagles had managed to secure
costumes from the film to use in the decor. ''They came up ever so
slightly smelly,'' says the practical Rosa.
Cleaned and displayed, the costumes make a focal point for the
drawing-room of the three-room suite. Neeson's costume, with its leather
jacket and oddly draped kilt in soft browns (no doubt authentic for the
period), belongs to a much larger man than the historic Roy Roy -- but
that's showbiz. Lange's costume, as Mrs MacGregor, is a daintily-bodiced
outfit on a mannequin.
Any forebodings about the Rob Roy concept are dispelled when one
enters the suite -- at the farthest point of a seemingly endless
Gleneagles corridor. No Balmorality here. Indeed the prevailing
atmosphere is rather austere.
Planning her design, Rosa had considered several MacGregor tartans --
and even a Rob Roy one -- and found them all ''extremely bright and
garish''. Her dilemma was solved by the Hunting MacGregor, with its
handsomely restrained deep burgundies and dark greens -- ''I could
really play up that,'' she thought. So the colour scheme was set.
The home-life of a Highlander in the early eighteenth century would
not, of course, have stretched to the creature comforts of this
#1000-a-night Gleneagles berth. ''What we're trying to do,'' explains
Rosa, ''is to create a fantasy, a romantic interlude.'' But within that
fiction, a rightness is observed.
Plush velvet carpets would have been out of place, for example.
Instead, Rosa decreed a much more rustic berber with a burgundy fleck.
She remembers the carpet-layer phoning in something of a panic to say:
''Amanda, this isn't what Gleneagles is used to!''
Her judgment was, as usual, sound. The carpet's plainness and the
complementary colouring of the subtly mottled walls set off the
furnishings -- antique oak table and chairs, reproduction wardrobes and
armoires also in oak, and tartan couches. Locally-bought antique chests
and leather-bound books of ancient statutes add to the period
atmosphere.
The luxurious fur drape over the four-poster bed need not agitate
animal rights protesters, for it's man-made and comes from France. And
there's a splendid coloured lithograph of Rob Roy's spouse confronting
the English soldiery and looking a dead ringer for Mrs Thatcher.
Lamp and candlestick holders continue the burgundy and bluey-green
theme. But the serious lighting is done by spotlight -- a bowing to
practical necessity. ''These rooms would look nothing without lighting
to give them oomph and drama,'' says Rosa. ''Hopefully, the effect of
the lighting is more significant than the light source itself.''
Rosa's concern for consistency extends to giving advice on the kind of
flowers which should be used in the suite. It's no place for ''your
typical carnations.'' Instead, she suggests something more rustic with
lots of greenery and big heads of rhododendrons or peonies.
Incredibly, the Rob Roy Suite was completed within four weeks, though
Rosa had already done her homework by visiting the Rob Roy Centre in
Callander, seeing rushes of the film, and consulting W H Murray's book
about the local hero. ''I seem to be used to very tight deadlines,'' she
muses. She gives due credit to her ''fairly good contacts'' and her own
design team.
Brought up and educated in Dumfries, she has seen her career gradually
burgeon since she graduated from Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art in
1983 with an honours BA in interior design. ''You come out thinking you
know everything; in reality you know nothing at all,'' she says.
Her shrewdness is accompanied by a ready chuckle and an unaffected
Scottish accent. Both her parents had Italian parents. Her father was
born in Scotland, her mother in Australia, where Rosa's grandparents had
gone because of the fascist regime in Italy. Her mother's maiden name
was Savoya and, says Rosa, ''I do believe I'm related to the Italian
royal family.'' Any hint of pretension is instantly pricked with her
follow-up observation, ''I think I've a bit of a cheek trying to get
away with that one!''
She doesn't believe her Italian connection has had much influence on
her designing. She has, she says, very little contact with Italy, though
she has some old aunts there.
The newly-wed Mrs Ken McCulloch recalls that her first job was with
her now husband. She worked with him for five years when he in turn was
doing a lot of work with Alloa Brewery. McCulloch was not a designer by
background, but was employed to design. His involvement sprang from his
frustration, as a restaurateur, with designers would not give him what
he wanted.
When the newly graduated Amanda joined his company she thought she was
joining ''this massive big design organisation, to find it was literally
he and I. I was completely and utterly thrown in at the deep end --
which I suppose was extremely good for me, but it didn't seem like that
at the time!'' She joined him when he was working on that most
sophisticated of Glasgow restaurants, the Rogano.
''It wasn't a romantic relationship then, it was very much a working
relationship,'' she recalls. The romance developed later. Their work
together culminated in doing house one of One Devonshire Gardens (there
are three linked houses under the general umbrella). Ken McCulloch
decided to base himself there, while Rosa set up her own company and
continued to work with McCulloch on an independent basis. Their
co-operation continued with house No 2.
''Very luckily, Devonshire has brought me a lot of work; it's a bit
like my showroom,'' says Rosa. ''It has really meant that I've never had
to advertise.''
Romance between Rosa and McCulloch gradually blossomed through their
work together and having ''very similar styles and similar passions. It
just really grew from that, a very natural progression. We're both
workaholics. Our holidays will be spent looking at hotels, and that's
what we enjoy. Very rarely do we take two weeks just to lie on the beach
and do nothing. There's always design in there somewhere!''
The Rosa hallmarks can been seen throughout the Devonshire complex,
whose clientele ranges from the opera singer Jose Carreras to the pop
group East 17. The three great terraced houses share an austerely
opulent elegance, offset by the gorgeous stained-glass staircase windows
in house No 2 and No 3 and touches of quirky wit. The model urchin
sitting on No 1's landing with his raffish straw hat has been known to
join tables of 13 at dinner.
''My style is quite masculine, not flowery, or fussy,'' says Rosa,
though she designs light as well as dark rooms. House number one has a
predominantly dark blue decor, the tone set by the carpet with its white
spots. Fake fig trees would fool anyone but the keenest
arboriculturalist.
An honorary Duke of Devonshire decorates one wall, while another
characteristic Rosa motif can be seen on others -- groups of little
pictures, some of historical subjects, set in deeply recessed dark
wooden frames. White lilies and ornamental thistle heads and plants of
pale orange begonias are worlds removed in sophistication from the
average hotel floral displays. Posies of white roses welcome diners.
The McCullochs themselves have an art deco flat, much simpler in
style, in Glasgow's West End. With their respective desks cleared, they
are taking off on a delayed honeymoon to the south of France on Monday.
Then it's back to work.
Rosa is in the process of finishing a company retreat in the Lake
District, then will turn her attention to Rossdhu House on Loch
Lomondside, where her proposals were preferred to those of a San
Francisco designer. Her deadline for redesigning and furbishing the
ground-floor rooms for her American clients is mid-July.
She will, as always, be aiming at ''an uncontrived feel'', this time
using a mixture of antique and reproduction furniture.
No doubt the commission will be finished on time and as stylishly as
everything else this impressive 34-year-old undertakes.

A TEAM of scientists are hoping, by genetic alteration, to develop a
new strain of potato that will not turn brown when it is fried.
Between eight and 10 scientists are working on the problem at the
Scottish Crop Research Institute at Invergowrie, near Dundee. They are
being financed by a grant of #250,000 from an EU fund designed to
promote research into farming and food technology.
Another #250,000 is being contributed by UK and European crisp
manufacturers.
The goal is to develop a potato that can be kept at low temperatures
without its starch being naturally converted to sugars such as glucose,
which makes crisps too brown when they are fried.
This effect can be halted by storing the potatoes at above 40[DEG]F.
But problem then is that the tubers think winter is over and spring is
on its way, and they start sprouting naturally.
At present crisp-makers use a spray of chemicals to halt this growth,
but Golden Wonder, Smiths, and other firms would prefer to present a
''greener'' image to the buying public.
The idea of targeting the potatoes' genes came from an earlier study
involving scientists in Germany, Holland, and Denmark as well as
Scotland.
But the Scottish scientists have won the contest to take the study one
stage further and do actual trials on the ''clone'' tatties produced so
far.

LONG before a ticket was sold, National Lottery operators Camelot
racked up a profit.
But making money without trading is nowhere as mindboggling as figures
being quoted now that the lottery is up and running. The first #1 was
handed over in November, and analysts forecast Camelot's profits by the
end of its seven-year franchise at #1500m to #2000m.
It is suspected the five-strong consortium has already covered the
#90m start-up costs. Ticket sales are #62m-a-week, with another #44m
going on scratch cards. Observers put overall income at #1800m, not
forecast to be reached for two years.
Accounts published next month are likely to show Camelot pre-tax
profits of #1m a week, with a current take of 9% of money wagered.
Firms that snapped up the original 50,000 Ordinary #1 shares are the
winners -- De La Rue, GTECH UK, Racal Electronics, and Cadbury
Schweppes, which each bought 11,250, and International Computers Ltd,
which purchased 5000.
The Government also hit the jackpot. The Treasury takes 12% in tax --
nearly #13m -- a week.
Five National Lottery quangos to distribute cash to ''good causes''
are also doing nicely. By the lottery's first anniversary, they will
have budgeted #21m to open offices and hire hundreds of staff or
advisers.
Retailers, on 5p-a-ticket, have already picked up #50m; advertising
and marketing sectors more than #34m.
The Churchill family has also emerged as a principal beneficiary, with
#12m paid for papers of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill.
Another winner is the BBC, with Saturday night ratings boosted by live
draw coverage.
The current take for Camelot -- which cannot lose, unlike punters --
is put at 9%. Over the seven-year franchise, it should average 5%.
From its inception in May 1993 to the financial year end in March 1994
-- when it did not trade -- the group made #617.
The proceeds came from interest on #50,000 placed in a bank as shares
were allotted. That humble profit went to reserves. No dividends were
paid. But from such meagre beginnings do millions beckon.
The consortium projected profits would not be made until the fourth
year of trading, but income is such that next month's accounts may show
pre-tax profits of #18m-#20m on 20 weeks' sales.
Profits in the first year could reach #150m. Equity capital, and #41m
of a #75m loan, could be covered before one penny goes to good causes.
Watchdog body Oflat may claw back some profits under a formula so
complicated it has been said you need to be a Cambridge mathematician to
work it out.
Labour's Lord Donoughue put concerns succinctly, telling peers the
Government was being taken for a ride. He believes 26% of takings, not
28% as promised, go to good causes; prizes amount to 48% instead of 50%,
and Camelot's current take is 11% rather than 5.8%.
Camelot denies profits at others' expense. It was always planned to
retain a bigger percentage of income early on, falling to an average 5%
over the franchise.
Incorporated in May 1993 as Barleygreen Ltd, two name changes followed
before settling in the September for Camelot Group Ltd.
Trading began in June 1994, after being Camelot was told it would run
the lottery. The licence was received on July 29. Share capital
increased to #50m, subscribed fully by existing shareholders.
From every #1 ticket, 27p goes to good causes. Just 5.6p is for
charity, via the National Charities Board. The remaining 21.4p is
divvied up between the National Heritage Memorial Fund, Millennium
Commission, Arts Council, and Sports Council. So far, each has been
handed #100m.
Public concerns focus on National Heritage's Churchill gift -- and the
Charities Board, which plans to spend almost #5m by October on 13
offices and more than 100 assessors to decide who deserves help. It has
yet to pay out.
Watford-based Camelot's chief executive is Tim Holley, who has been
described as the most boring man on earth after John Major. He earns
#240,000 a year.
The 20-strong board includes Lord John Moore of Lower Marsh, former
Tory Economic Secretary to the Treasury, now chairman of Credit Suisse
Asset Management; Sir Ernest Harrison, of Racal, Chubb, Decca, and
Vodafone; Sir Peter Imbert, Securicor director; Mr Norman Hawkins,
managing director of Cadbury International; Ms Mary Baker, director of
Avon Cosmetics, Barclays Bank, and MFI, among others, and Mr Leslie
Cullen, of Eden Vale, Grand Metropolitan, and Express Dairy.
Two are registered with addresses abroad -- business executive Guy
Snowden, from Florida, and Mr David Clark, lottery operations director,
from Montreal.

UNSCRUPULOUS lottery scratchcard winners are claiming cash prizes
twice on the same card, it was claimed yesterday.
The problem arises when retailers do not immediately invalidate
winning cards, but save them up in batches before sending the numbers to
the central computer.
This enables winners to go to another outlet with their ticket and
claim a second prize before the numbers are invalidated.
About #45m is spent each week on Instants cards first introduced on
March 21 this year. Around 10% of lottery outlets could be affected, but
a spokesman for Camelot, the organisers, said it was a minor problem.
Retailers, however, are being held responsible for any losses incurred
as a result of double claims on winning tickets.
''A limited number of claims for duplicate payment of low-tier (#10)
payments have been identified,'' the spokesman admitted.
''These are at the expense of the individual initial retailer.
Consequently in support of all the retailers, Camelot has recently
reminded them of their responsibilities in their own interests.''
Ticket sellers are required to deface the Instants ticket when paying
prizes by cutting, tearing, or punching a hole through the barcode.
In the two months since their launch Instants have encountered several
problems.
The #1 cards -- which can lead to a top prize of #50,000 -- had to be
withdrawn on the day of the launch after a ''minor problem'' with
software.
Last month a newsagent was barred from distributing damaged tickets
which he knew could not win prizes.
Another shop lost its franchise after staff were reported to have
slightly scratched the cards to reveal a code and then kept the winning
tickets.

THIS week millions of Britons have staked their claim, like the gold
rush prospectors of old, to a share in tonight's #20m lottery jackpot.
But, having made their marks, the seam of numbers they mine will lead
most to fool's gold. Hitting paydirt -- as Joe McBride, Scotland's first
big lottery winner knows only too well -- is the preserve of the lucky
few.
Mr McBride, 32, a welder at John Brown's in Clydebank, won #368,000 in
January -- a win his wife, Ann, foretold in a reading of her tarot
cards.
Yesterday Mrs McBride brought out the cards again. The good news is
that Mr McBride will be leaving the field clear for the rest of us
tonight. The bad will hold for later.
Mr McBride said: ''I'll do it this week but not for the money. I don't
expect to win it. I only do it to see how many numbers I can get.''
It was five numbers and a bonus ball which brought them the #368,000
in January and 15 minutes of fame at a stand-up news conference where,
with a jeroboam of champagne spot-welded to his hand, Mr McBride ran
through the changes he would be making to his life.
They would be leaving their three-bedroom council house in Whitecrook,
Clydebank, for a new house, he would be dropping in at John Brown's to
hand in his notice while he would also be buying a gym to make himself
more handsome. A car and holiday would follow.
So how had the changes panned out for the family who struck gold? Mr
McBride said: ''We went to see a fancy house at #125,000 but it was too
flash and wasn't for us. Then we fell in love with this house which we
bought for a little over #84,000.''
The four-bedroom house sits at the head of a quiet cul-de-sac in
Hardgate, a few miles from the McBrides' old home. ''We wanted to stay
in Clydebank, either that or Italy.''
At the time Mr McBride hinted that he may be leaving John Brown's with
less than a five-fingered goodbye. ''As it happened I didn't quit the
job, because one of the gaffers advised me to stay on because I was
going to be paid off.
''I took his advice, although I was off sick for most of the time
after injuring my back by lifting my sister-in-law during a drunken
antic.''
The gym? ''I bought a ski machine, weights and a punchbag to go with
my bike. But it hasn't made me any prettier. A brown bag over my head
would do that better.''
The car followed, a Toyota Previa, while Mr McBride indulged himself
by buying an old Army jeep. The holiday became a honeymoon for the
McBrides, who have four children.
''We went to Ibiza on our own. It was technically our honeymoon. On
our original honeymoon we went to Wemyss Bay and came back to find that
the roof of our house had fallen in. So that didn't really count.''
Having undergone such changes, were they any happier? Mr McBride said:
''We always were happy, only before we were happy and skint. Winning the
money has made life a lot easier. However, not having a job is hard, and
we may be starting to get on each other's nerves. So I'm looking forward
to starting a course at Clydebank College later this year.''
This will be a one-year computing course which Mr McBride eventually
hopes will lead him to his own business. He already has a small one up
and running producing personalised calendars.
''However if I could find a job between now and then I would take it.
My main ambition is to work for myself and make money rather than
winning it. But I would advise any lottery winner to do something.''
That apart, were there any other drawbacks to fame and fortune? It is
Ann McBride who answers. ''I used to love going shopping but the thrill
has gone now that you can buy what you want and don't have to work and
save for it.''
Having said that, the McBrides are not about to hand the money back.
Their life may have been turned on its head, but they still have their
feet planted firmly on the ground.
* And the bad news? It was Mr McBride's four-year-old son Cameron who
provided his father with the winning numbers in January. According to
Mrs McBride's tarot reading, Lady Luck is about to smile on an older
chap with the same name. I wonder who that could be.

<HEADLINE>Farry sues for #50,000 over Sun 'dictator' story</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH Football Association chief executive Jim Farry is claiming
damages of #50,000 over a newspaper story which accused him of aspiring
to be dictator.
The article in the Sun strongly criticised a letter from the SFA which
objected to the presence of veteran Celtic and Scotland physiotherapist
Jimmy Steele in the Celtic dugout.
Mr Farry alleges that the ''malicious'' article damaged his reputation
and that the Sun has refused to apologise and pay a sum to a charity or
organisation of his choice.
At the Court of Session yesterday, Lord Osborne heard that during the
1993/94 season the SFA discussed who should be entitled to occupy the
dugout or ''technical area''. It was agreed that the number should be
restricted to eight per club, and this was intimated to all Scottish
clubs in January 1994.
It was left to each club to decide who should occupy the dugout, as
long as each person had a ''specific and intrinsic function to fulfil''.
Clubs had to submit a form with the names to the referee.
After a Motherwell v Celtic match on January 29, 1994, Mr Farry wrote
to Celtic, saying that Jimmy Steele had been named as a person who would
be in the technical area.
The form had described Mr Steele as a ''retired physio'' and Mr
Farry's letter noted: ''It would seem that he (Mr Steele) did not have a
working role at the match'' and that his presence in the technical area
was contrary to the terms of the SFA's letter.
The letter concluded: ''I would therefore request that you ensure that
your club complies at all times in future with the terms of the
association's instructions.''
The Sun published a story on February 15 which said that Mr Farry had
decided to ban Mr Steele from the dugout.
Former Celtic player Tommy Gemmell was quoted as saying: ''Farry is
going down the same road as his predecessors. He wants to be a dictator.
For anyone to have the temerity to insult the man in this manner after
the services he has given to Celtic and Scottish football over the years
is an absolute disgrace.''
Mr Farry argues that the Sun story was false and malicious, implied
that he was a law unto himself and that he acted without the backing and
support of his employers. He denies that he is a dictator or that his
letter was an insult to Jimmy Steele.
The Sun, which is asking for a jury trial, claims that the statements
of fact made in the story were substantially true.
It says that for more than 35 years Mr Steele had been unpaid
volunteer with both Scotland and Celtic, as a back-up and support man.
The fact that he had retired had no bearing on carrying out his function
for more than a decade before the 1993/94 season. In the circumstances,
the article was fair comment.
Lord Osborne will give a decision in writing later.

THE footballing metaphors abounded during the Perthshire hustings --
from the ''Here we go'' chants of the victorious SNP supporters'
adulation of their candidate as ''Ooh! Aah! Rose-anna!'' down to the 8-2
cuffing on the park inflicted in a ''friendly'' match by the media on
the Tories.
But something that underlay the campaign for all parties was the whole
question of playing for Scotland.
Labour, or as it reaffirmed itself after last year's conference, the
Scottish Labour Party, achieved a decent result in the poll but it was
overshadowed the spin, hype and hubris put on at the insistence of Mr
Tony Blair's office and his people's failure to understand the
difference in political culture north and south of the Border.
For all that the Conservatives tried to right off the by-election as
mid-term blues, it follows a pattern of electoral misery, organisational
disarray, and profound discontent with factors such as taxation and
sleaze.
The slide from incumbent to third place cannot be as lightly dismissed
as it was yesterday. The Tories have to recognise that something has
gone badly wrong with their party in Scotland.
Hence the wild talk of drastic measures prompted by a report in a
London newspaper yesterday suggesting that Scottish Conservative and
Unionists may be about to become simply the Scottish Unionists.
That was dismissed yesterday by Sir Michael Hirst, Scottish party
chairman, but there is no doubt the party is at a crossroads. In the
opinion poll doldrums, beset by self-doubt, and with a Scottish
conference overshadowed by speculation that Home Office Minister Michael
Forsyth has been mounting a whispering campaign against Scottish
Secretary, the Tories have just suffered a humiliating mid-term defeat.
No matter how they dress it up, their campaign in Perth and Kinross
was an embarrassment and their third place was a poor showing. They
characterised the SNP's Roseanna Cunningham as an extreme
anti-monarchist, a dangerous republican socialist. She promptly
increased her share of the vote and was returned as MP with a handsome,
if unspectacular, majority in a rural constituency which had been
conservative in every sense of the word.
Raymond Robertson has confirmed that he will not be acting as
candidate's campaign minder for a fourth time. After Perth and Kinross,
Monklands East, and Kincardine and Deeside his role has been something
of a black spot. If his job was to avoid banana skins in recent weeks,
he failed as John Godfrey ran a series of lines that failed or
backfired.
If, as they insist he will, John Godfrey contests the seat in future
he will have to be better briefed, organised, and supported. From his
constituency headquarters at a military bunker in the hills, to his city
centre campaign office in a former funeral parlour, it all went wrong.
His Nazi-slur at the outset was an error, as was his wrapping the
campaign in the Union Flag over VE-Day weekend. As a self-avowed defence
candidate he was unable to name the Scottish regiments. Someone should
have cleared the roadblocks in his path.
But the question of making the by-election a single-issue campaign on
the constitution will reverberate. The likelihood is that the Union will
continue to be a focal point but that the language will soften.
All of this should have left the Labour campaign to break through
under the high-profile leadership of Tony Blair, who visited the
constituency twice.
Blair's commitment, however, was not matched by the number of Labour
activists from around the country. Whether this was a generalised
reaction from an element who felt that candidate Douglas Alexander had
risen too far and fast on the coat tails of Shadow Chancellor Gordon
Brown, or whether it betrayed a more generalised disgruntlement by the
Scottish left over the abandonment of Clause Four, it is too early to
say.
By squeezing ahead of the Tories into second place and achieving a
healthy improvement in its share of the vote, Labour has probably headed
off a row between the Scottish party and London headquarters.
But if Alex Salmond is right to claim that his party is on a roll,
then Labour and te Tories are going to have to strengthen their
organisation and improve their decision-making,
Neither snappy sound-bites nor repetitive assertions about the
importance of the Union will suffice on their own. The Scottish
dimension is firmly back on the political agenda.

IT IS only just beginning to sink in that I am now the Member of
Parliament for the people of Perth and Kinross.
As the campaign progressed, all pointers were that this was going to
be a victory for the Scottish National Party, but we took nothing for
granted.
The round of morning press conferences, canvassing, and public
meetings -- sometimes two a night -- throughout the constituency, is a
punishing schedule and I am looking forward to a couple of days relaxing
at home with my cat, Koschka.
But a couple of days rest is all I'll get. Although Parliament is in
recess, I already have an engagement in London acting as a proxy for
some Perth and Kinross shareholders at the British Gas annual meeting.
It has been a long haul, but it has been worth it. As the dust settles
and I look back it is clear to me that there was a world of a difference
between the way in which we fought the campaign and the approach that
our opponents -- particularly the Conservative and Labour parties --
were taking.
Throughout this campaign, we talked about our policies -- the things
we want to see put in place. The people of Perth and Kinross knew
exactly what they were voting for when they went to the polls on
Thursday.
I do not want to dwell too long on the campaigns run by my opponents
since their negative tactics have been roundly and deservedly rejected
by the people of Perth and Kinross. But the attempts to introduce North
American style negative campaigning -- play the woman, not the ball --
was an important aspect of this campaign.
Labour's campaign was devoid of policy while the Tories' seemed to be
devoid of common sense.
The Tories started out by claiming to have ''exposed'' me as a
republican. A strange claim since my personal views on the merits of an
elected Head of State have never been a great secret.
I have to say that the only real public reaction that I had to that
particular Tory onslaught was that people started to come up to me,
whether or not they shared my views, to say that they respected someone
who was prepared to take an honest stand.
The hysteria from the Tory camp hit fever-pitch at times with their
hyperbole taking them into orbit.
I read before the televised debates that the Tory game plan was to
make me lose my temper. Well I can assure them that I was certainly
angry -- and I am still angry -- at the way in which this Government has
treated Scotland.
George Robertson set the tone for Labour from the start by saying that
the SNP would lie our way through the campaign -- before we had even
said a word. They then followed that up with the most incredible piece
of electoral arithmetic I have ever seen.
Apparently our method of calculating the results from the local
government elections -- adding up all the votes cast -- was not
''rigorous'' enough for Labour.
The problem that Labour faced was that they were trying to run a high
risk campaign without taking any risks. While Tony Blair was trying to
blow the bubble which burst on Thursday night, the Labour candidate was
trying desperately not to answer a single question.
Thursday night saw a victory of honesty and decency over the
playground chants of the opposition.
As I said in my acceptance speech, I hope that not just my victory but
the manner in which the SNP conducted our campaign makes it clear that
ours is a democratic message designed to include all of the people of
Scotland regardless of origin. It is not where you come from as an
individual that is important but where we are going together as part of
the community of Scotland.
The Scottish National Party offered the people of Perth and Kinross a
vision -- the positive message of ''Decent Scotland'' -- a Scotland of
social justice and equality of opportunity. The electors of Perth and
Kinross have shown that they share that vision.
But this victory is not the end, it is part of the process. The job
for all of us in the Scottish National Party now is to build on this
result and -- in the words of Canadian poet Denis Lee -- ''work as in
the early days of a better nation'' to make that dream a reality.

A KEY man in Scottish politics is Simon Turner, Michael Forsyth's
agent in Stirling, who has twice saved that seat when it seemed sure to
topple.
This week found him, in the Auchterader division of the constituency
of Perth and Kinross, trying to pull off the same trick -- and knowing
he had lost. ''We're just doing our best,'' he said gloomily, as he
prepared a final mailshot to a meagre list of pledged Conservatives.
The best was still impressive. By Monday afternoon the Auchterarder
division, with 12% of the voters, had been fully canvassed, except for
the last bits that I and some pals arrived to do. Nicky Fairbairn's
electoral machine must always have been good, to keep him on the road
when Tories all around were falling by the wayside. The machine still
purrs faultlessly away, but now the wheels spin in the air.
For the day I sloughed off my reptile's skin and moulted from paid
hack into party hack. I donned a blue rosette and went on the campaign
trail. I joined it only against strong objections from Central Office,
which finds me politically incorrect.
We first descend on a new housing estate in Auchterarder. I had not
known such things existed there, since it has always struck me as a
typical Scots lang toun showing a blank, bleak face to the world. These
places have to be worked hard to yield their secrets. One of our team
specialises in just this. He likes to pick out from the electoral
register households which appear to consist of lesbian couples, then woo
them -- for the Conservative Party of course.
He has thus scored many successes in the central belt. But things are
different here, where he finds only elderly widowed sisters of
impeccable virtue. They are all Tories. The vote seems to be holding. We
report this back to Mr Turner, and try to cheer him up.
Then we go for a blitz on Dunning, which according to his records has
never been canvassed, even in Sir Nicky's day.
I advance with confidence on the biggest house in the square. The door
is opened by a man with a sturdy farmer's gait, cheeks aglow from
warming beverages, untipped cigarette in hand. He answers my dulcet Tory
tones in broad Scots, to say with some relish that none of his household
would dream in a thoosand year of voting for us. After that, it goes
downhill.
In fact I begin to despair of finding any Conservatives. When our team
gathers a couple of hours later to tot up results from our canvassing
cards, there appear to be only seven definitely committed supporters in
the whole village. So far from our blitzing Dunning, Dunning has blitzed
us.
Still, one can learn a lot on the doorsteps, some of which only falls
into place the morning after polling day. It seems to me that Dunning
got just the outcome that it wanted, to give Roseanna Cunningham a
victory but not a triumph. These good folk know that she is a socialist
and a separatist, and few of them like her views. She will have to exert
herself to retain their allegiance at the General Election. But they
have chosen her as the best one to slap the Government in the face.
To that extent, there is something in the Tories' interpretation of a
protest vote. But it is too glib and easy an excuse, because they also
misunderstood an electorate that they ought to have known like the back
of their hands.
Their cry of ''the Union in danger'' fell flat, for sensible people
could see perfectly well that the Union was in no danger from a single
by-election. If the Union ever is in danger, most will stand by it.
Meanwhile, they want to know what else the Government is going to do
to win back their support, and they hear a deafening silence.
Scottish Conservatism has simply run out of steam; its wheels spin in
the air. How could it be otherwise when the authoritarian mediocrity of
its central organs now seeks to extend its palsied grip down to the
level of the individual canvasser?
Fairbairn held for more than 20 years a seat which Godfrey lost.
Godfrey is the very model of the modern Tory candidate, but Fairbairn
would nowadays not have stood the slightest chance of getting on the
candidates' list. There must be a lesson there somewhere.

ROSEANNA Cunningham's victory in Perth and Kinross is the SNP's fourth
by-election victory since the late 1960s and their first in a head to
head with the Conservatives.
However, absent from Thursday night's comments from SNP leader Alex
Salmond, was any mention of a ''sea change'' in Scottish politics.
The SNP was content to treat the result as a strengthening of its
claim to be Scotland's second party. This, of course, is not to say that
Ms Cunningham's victory is insignificant, more that it was very much
expected rather than simply hoped for. Perth and Kinross was already a
marginal seat. Many predicted Ms Cunningham's victory, not in 1995, but
back in 1992 at the last General Election.
But in many other important respects this was a by-election in which
all the major parties have won and lost something. The swing to the SNP
from the Tories was 11.5%. While this would be a remarkable performance
in a General Election, it does not compare favourably to SNP swings in
Hamilton (38% in 1967), Govan (27% in 1973), and Govan again (33% in
1988). Indeed, all three of these seats returned to Labour at the
subsequent General Election.
In fact, the swing in Perth and Kinross is almost identical to the one
achieved by Nicol Stephen for the Liberal Democrats in Kincardine and
Deeside in 1991. A few months later a bright parliamentary future for Mr
Stephen was extinguished by the Tories with an increased majority.
The SNP's 40% share of the vote on Thursday ran ahead of its 1992
General Election performance of 36% and ahead of its 37% showing in the
equivalent local government wards last month. However, it has
significantly under-performed in comparison to their opionion poll
ratings in both System Three surveys in March (48%) and last weekend
(52%).
We know that voters do make tactical choices in by-elections, it is
also the case the potential voters can give tactical answers to
pollsters. It seems that many contemplating voting SNP either did not in
the end, or simply stayed away. The performances of both the Liberal
Democrats and Labour may offer an alternative view.
Statistically, Perth and Kinross is Labour's best Scottish by-election
performance since the war. They not only almost doubled their share of
the vote, but actually increased the number of votes cast for them by
more 3000. This is no mean feat when Thursday's turnout was only 62%
compared to 77% at the last General Election.
While Labour's excitement about their prospects during the last two
weeks of the campaign was always going to look overstated with
hindsight, it does offer another piece of evidence that Labour's current
strength across the UK, in areas not traditionally fertile, is more
solid than it has been for three decades.
Labour's performance in Perth and Kinross is not unlike Eastleigh last
year, when again they managed to increase their vote share propelling
them from third place to second.
The Liberal Democrats looked like suffering a classic squeeze but
their vote held up well and was not far short of the 14% they gained in
the recent local elections.
For the Tories, it was not the worst performance seen this parliament
in by-elections, although their vote share was almost halved to 21%.
Both Newbury and Christchurch last year demonstrated swings against the
Tories far in excess of Perth and Kinross. However, not since Glasgow
Queen's Park in 1982 have the Tories seen a large share of the vote cut
in half in Scotland.
That by-election was three years into a parliament as was this one. In
1973, also three years in Ted Heath's term of office, the Tories lost
votes heavily in three by-elections in one single day in November. In
Berwick-upon-Tweed they lost 11%, in Edinburgh North there was a 14%
loss, and in Glasgow Govan, the Tories, who had captured 28% in 1970,
were reduced to 12%.
Interestingly in all of these by-elections the Labour vote was also
down and yet they went on to win a General Election in a matter of
months. In Perth and Kinross the Labour vote share almost doubled.
The real test for the Tories' explanations of absent friends, the
SNP's forward march and New Labour's readiness for government will come
at the next General Election. There, the issue of the Union will again
come under the spotlight. In Perth and Kinross, the result was a mixed
message on the constitution, not unlike the many electoral mixed
messages of the last 25 years.
With the Union taking centre stage, the SNP can take credit from a
victory which put its reason for being on the line. That was not the
case last year in the Monklands East by-election, where Labour's record
in local government came under the spotlight.
But the SNP did not expect to win in Monklands. In Perth and Kinross
they did expect to win, and have delivered. This is yet another bloody
nose to an already punch-drunk Tory Party. They cannot hope to get off
the ropes in electoral terms without some change of tactics.
The Tories must now realise that their small increase in fortunes in
the 1992 General Election was not attributable to the Union card, or
face the consequences. Last weekend 39% of Tories in Perth and Kinross
expressed a preference for some form of constitutional change in our
System Three poll.
Arthur Bell of the Scottish Tory Reform Group said yesterday that
voters in Scottish local elections and the Perth and Kinross by-election
had delivered two yellow cards to the Scottish Tories, and that
something had to give before they received a red one. Perhaps Mr Bell
should consult the rules of association football. He will find that two
yellow cards automatically result in a red one.
The Tories have now been ''sent off'' in local government and Perth
and Kinross. This by-election result again points to an early bath for
the Tories at the next General Election.

FORMER world snooker champion Alex ''Hurricane'' Higgins has been
mugged after making a withdrawal from a bank cash machine.
He was robbed of #175 after visiting the cashpoint at Barclays Bank,
in Oxford Road, Manchester, early on Thursday.
Higgins, 46, of Didsbury, Manchester, told police that he had been
attacked by a man outside the bank near Manchester Royal Infirmary.
The snooker star is believed not to have been hurt in the incident. He
is said to have flagged down a passing police car.
''We are following a positive line of inquiry,'' the police said.

A VIDEO identification expert told the appeal court that a man jailed
for eight years for robbery was not the man captured on a security
video.
Dr Anne Coombes compared photographs of Alan Church to stills taken
from the video and concluded that Church's face didn't match that of the
robber.
Church, 29, was found guilty at the High Court in Glasgow in June 1994
of robbing the Alliance and Leicester Building Society in St Vincent
Place, Glasgow, of #930 in January 1993.
Three members of the building society staff and a customer identified
Church in court as the robber and the three employees had also picked
him out at an identification parade.
Church appealed against his conviction, however, and asked to be
allowed to present new identification evidence to the appeal court.
His counsel argued that expert evidence about differences between his
face and that of the robber caught on the video was not before the
original jury. Without that evidence their verdict amounted to a
miscarriage of justice.
Three appeal judges headed by Lord Hope, the Lord Justice-General,
allowed Church to lead the new evidence despite the fact that it could
have been available at his original trial.
That unprecedented decision was later reversed by a five-judge bench
in a different case but Church was able to continue with his appeal.
Lord Hope, sitting with Lords Clyde and Allanbridge, began hearing his
new evidence yesterday.
Dr Coombes, 29, a consultant medical physicist, said that she and a
colleague had studied stills from the security video and photographs of
Church taken from similar angles.
They compared the shapes of the faces, and the sizes and form of the
main features.
Measurements were made of distances between features and angles of
lines drawn between them, as well as comparisons of details of the ears.
Dr Coombes said that there were a number of similarities between
Church's face and the face on the video.''However, there are also some
significant differences we are not able to explain,'' she added.
0 Cross-examined by Iain Bonomy QC, the Advocate-depute, Dr Coombes
conceded that, if the camera angle of the video film was different from
the photos of Church, the comparisons would be affected.
Mr Bonomy also put it to her that the difference in quality between
the two sets of pictures was such that it was impossible to make
comparisons.
The appeal was continued to a date to be fixed.

POLICE were grappling with a headache yesterday after five crane
lorries were dumped in a village street in a divorce dispute.
Mr Nigel Lambert arranged for the lorries to be left outside the home
of his ex-wife in Little Oxley, near West Malling, Kent.
Mr Lambert said divorce payments became too much so he wound up his
business Gazewing Plant Ltd, making staff redundant, and left its assets
-- the five lorries -- with his wife.
Police have responded to the problem by putting #24 parking tickets on
each vehicle daily and so far they have accumulated #240 in fixed
penalties.
Inspector Norman Williams, of Maidstone Police, said there was nothing
else they could do.
He described the lorries as ''bloody great things'', and said: ''These
vehicles are parked outside this lovely house. It does look really
awful.
''We are champing at the bit here to get these vehicles removed.''
But he added: ''Even if we had the power to remove these vehicles, we
don't have the keys for the damned things.''
Mr Lambert, who is retaining the keys to the lorries, said from his
home near Dover: ''I have offered my ex-wife the whole company because I
am so sick and tired of all this.''
He added: ''We were divorced three years ago and since then it has
cost me a fortune in settlement and legal fees.
''Added to that, I gave up the four-bedroom detached house and for the
past two months have been denied access to our two children.''
His ex-wife was unavailable for comment.

A MOTHER of 13 said yesterday that she would complain to the Lord
Advocate after a sheriff said her family had brought misery to a
community.
Mrs Margaret Haney, 52, known in Raploch, Stirling, as Big Mags, said
Sheriff Norrie Stein had yesterday branded her relatives ''another
family from hell''.
Sheriff Stein criticised the family before sentencing Mrs Haney's
youngest son Joseph, 20, to 60 days at Stirling Sheriff Court yesterday
for being found on a flat roof at the rear of the Golden Lion Hotel,
Stirling, in April in circumstances where it could be reasonably
inferred he intended to commit theft.
Haney had denied the charge, claiming he had climbed onto the 25ft
platform to urinate. Sheriff Stein had deferred sentence for reports
earlier this month after finding him guilty.
Sheriff Stein addressed his remarks in open court to solicitor Ian
Angus, who has represented members of the family at countless court
appearances over the last 10 years.
He said: ''What troubles me is the misery that this particular family
has inflicted on the Raploch community over many, many years.''
He went on: ''If I were the presiding sheriff here I'd be taking very
severe steps to make sure that this particular family -- and I know
there are others in the Raploch -- are deterred from any further
offending.''
Sheriff Stein, the resident sheriff in Arbroath, normally sits in
Stirling on alternate Fridays.
Outside the court, Mrs Haney, of Glendevon Drive, Raploch, said she
would be meeting her lawyer next week and referring Sheriff Stein's
comments to the Lord Advocate.
She said: ''He's branded us another family from hell.''
Eight of Mrs Haney's 13 children are still alive -- the others have
died of cot death, cancer, or other causes.
Between them, seven of the eight have made hundreds of court
appearances for offences including housebreaking, shoplifting, assault,
breach of the peace, possession of drugs, and one of mobbing and
rioting.
Mrs Haney said that of her surviving children William, 29, Valerie,
28, Diane, 27, Catherine, 24, twins Hughie and Mandy, 23, Stella, 21,
and Joseph, 20, only Diane has never been sentenced to a term of
imprisonment or custody.
Joseph has 45 previous convictions, many of them for housebreaking.
But Mrs Haney blamed the Government and conditions in the Raploch,
offically listed one of the most deprived schemes in Scotland, for her
family's offences.
She admitted she used to deal cannabis, many of her family had drug
problems, and five of her children had at one time been in care.
She said none of her children, who are all now adults, had ever had a
job.
Mrs Haney and her husband James McMenamin, 45, are also unemployed. Mr
McMenamin is on remand in Barlinnie awaiting trial on a breach of the
peace charge.
Mrs Haney said: ''There've been a lot of court appearances, I don't
know how many hundred, and every Haney that's ever been in front of a
sheriff has been imprisoned.
''I grieve for my bairns when they get the jail, but my children have
been brought up in the jungle and have had to fight for their survival.
''They come out of school, get their dole money, and the drugs take
over. The only way they can feed their habit is by stealing.
''But they're too stupid and they get caught for everything they do.
Sometimes other people provoke them, and they're the ones that get
caught.
''Sheriff Stein has segregrated my family from the rest of the
Raploch.
''But if it wasn't for the Haneys he'd be out of a job.
''I'm going to fight for justice for my family. They've never done
anything really bad like rape or murder. It's just petty crime.
''Very few Haneys ever walk free from this court. It's
institutionalising them.''
Mr Angus said outside the court: ''I'll be consulting with my client
next week to consider the position.''
Stella Haney, who has served 20 terms of imprisonment or youth custody
since she was 16, said last night she would only give up her life of
crime if the Government paid her.
She said: ''I'm a shoplifter. It's like my job. I can make #60, #70 or
up to #100 a week, and I only get #36 from the social. Until I get
enough money from social security I'll carry on shoplifting.''
She added: ''The sheriff was trying to make out we're another family
from hell like the family in Fife. But the Haneys aren't from hell --
the Haneys have been in hell.''
Mrs Haney held court for photographers yesterday in her four-bedroom
flat.
The flat below is empty, boarded up by Stirling District Council.
Weeds and unkempt grass blow in the tenement front garden.
But behind Mrs Haney's front door, there are smart furnishings,
ceramic figurines, porcelain dolls, cabinets of china, and hi-tech
electrical equipment.
Mrs Haney said: ''I do what I can with the dig money the family give
me.''

A RWANDAN family arrived in Scotland yesterday to begin a new life
away from their African home, thanks to a new Edinburgh-based charity.
Mr Nicholas Hitimana, 31, his wife, Elsie, 32, and 18-month-old
Jonathan will live in Edinburgh while Mr Hitimana studies for an MSc at
Edinburgh University's College of Agriculture.
They have been brought to Scotland by the Charles Bilinda Memorial
Trust, the charity founded by the Scots-born widow of the 34-year-old
pastor who was among the million Rwandans murdered in the genocide of
April 1994.
Mr Hitimana described the family's ordeal of the last 12 months.
''Before the war life was very nice for us in Rwanda. When the war
started it was really very very hard, especially for my family as they
were killing Tutsi and my wife is a Tutsi, so we tended to experience a
hard time,'' he said.
Mrs Bilinda said: ''When the news came out last year that Charles had
probably been killed, my reaction was I don't want to feel his death had
been wasted. He was a pastor and devoted Christian who wanted to serve
God in his life.''
She said further Rwandan refugees could be brought to study in
Scotland, if funds could be raised.
* Donations can be made to the Charles Bilinda Memorial Trust at 3
Millerfield Place, Edinburgh.

HUNTERS became the hunted when police stumbled on drug dealers
pretending to hunt rabbits.
The dealers panicked and threw away #25,000 worth of cannabis because
they thought they were about to be snared in a police trap.
But the police were merely on a routine patrol through the countryside
and had stopped to watch the hunters.
The dealers were posing as rabbit hunters complete with country
clothing, a greyhound, and a pack of Jack Russell terriers at a wood
near Bankhead Farm, Chapelhall in Lanarkshire.
When they saw the officers, the two dealers took to their heels, and
dealers and dogs gave police the slip in the dense wood.
Detective Inspector Davie Johnston, in charge of the inquiry, said:
''The officers got quite a surprise when they examined a plastic bag
which one of the men tossed away.
''Inside was cannabis with a street value of between #20,000 and
#25,000.
''We believe the men were about to hide the drugs at the scene, which
was close to the road. Hiding drugs in the countryside is common
practice among dealers who don't want to be caught with their drugs at
home.''
He appealed to the public for help in finding the dealers who may have
been seen in the area earlier on Thursday pretending they were hunters.
One was aged about 30, six-foot tall and wore a dark waxed jacket. The
other wore a sports jacket and jeans.

<TEXT>
EFFORTS to find an Aids vaccine has been advanced by new British
research on monkeys, published in the Lancet yesterday.
Monkeys vaccinated with a weakened form of SIV -- the simian form of
HIV which causes Aids -- survived later injection with a virulent strain
of the virus.
A team led by Dr Neil Almond at the National Institute for Biological
Standards and Control in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, used monkeys
because they are regarded as a good model for HIV infection in man.
Eight monkeys were treated with the weakened SIV strain. Almost a year
later, four of the animals were injected with virulent SIV and the other
four were injected with SIV-infected cells.
None of the eight vaccinated monkeys became infected, while eight
other monkeys not given the vaccine became SIV-positive.
The early results suggest that an obstacle in the development of an
Aids vaccine might have been overcome -- how to protect against
HIV-infected cells as well as against the virus itself.
The researchers accept that a live-but-weakened virus would be
dangerous to use as an HIV vaccine in man, because of the risk that its
virulence could return once it was established in the body.
Dr Almond suggested that the way forward was to understand the immune
mechanisms which had produced the protection in the monkeys.
Less hazardous ways of producing the vaccine could then be
investigated, he said.

He said: ''Covering the Assembly is hard work but I always enjoy it. I

Christopher Reekie
reports on the final day of the General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland
THE Moderator of the General Assembly, the Right Rev James Harkness,
last night called for a special effort to mark the year 2000 by reviving
the Church of Scotland and joining with other Christians in the
celebration.
In his address to the Assembly's closing session, he declined to be
drawn into the debate about whether the church should accept funds from
the proceeds of the Millennium Fund, but said the idea must be dismissed
that the celebrations were some kind of prize in a numbers game.
The occasion was about the 2000th anniversary of the moment in time
when God entered the world as Jesus Christ, and it was the duty of the
church to remind the nation of its fundamental significance, he said.
Mr Harkness said the national church, without diminishing the place
and contribution of other churches, had a special responsibility to the
people of Scotland in the provision of the ordinances of religion
throughout the land.
''I want to suggest that, as we look forward, it should be an occasion
for the re-evalution of the ministry of the church so that we use the
resources of the ordained ministry to best effect within a revitalised
parish structure as well as in other appointments.
''I want to suggest that it should be the occasion when we harness the
resources of the whole membership of the church and rediscover the
meaning of the 'priesthood of all believers'.
''Under the providence of God, I suggest that it must surely be an
opportunity to join with Christians of other traditions and
denominations, where that is appropriate and possible, in the task of
proclaiming the eternal truths of the faith.
''Not least -- and building on what has already been achieved -- let
us work together, without loss of integrity and with full recognition of
our inheritance in the faith, to avoid translating the divisions of this
millennium into the next. It will not be easy. The difficulties
sometimes seem insuperable. But, under God, we must try.''
He believed there was a God-given opportunity to set aside any mood of
despondency which some had about present problems and to break out of
any sense of fatalism about the future of the church.
The Moderator's call was made the day after Cardinal Thomas Winning,
of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, in an address to the Assembly,
presented a vision of an assembly of all Scottish Christians in the year
2000 to proclaim the Gospel.
Lady Fraser, Her Majesty's High Commissioner, said the Queen took a
deep interest in what the General Assembly did. The office she had held
for two years, Lady Fraser said, seemed to her to provide a similar link
between church and state, without which both would be diminished.
Meanwhile, the congregation of Strathaven West Church is set to return
to the Church of Scotland after having been in the Congregational Union
of Scotland since 1957.
The General Assembly yesterday approved a petition by the 319 members
of the church for readmission by 639 votes to 58. There has been a
church at Strathaven West since 1835, and it originally joined the
Church of Scotland in 1929.
* The Assembly thanked the Rev John Harvey for his ''seven outstanding
years of service'' as leader of the Iona Community.
The Rev Norman Shanks is the community's new leader.
* Mr Iain MacGregor, Kishorn, an elder, told the Assembly yesterday
that cattle were better than sheep to graze kirk glebes.
Although glebes were overgrazed, cattle were not so bad ''because they
have dung'', while sheep's droppings ''do no good to the land''.
There should be a top dressing of fertiliser to keep the glebe in good
shape, he said.
* Carberry Tower, the Church of Scotland's conference centre near
Musselburgh, is to be sold at full commercial value, the General
Assembly has agreed.
The new owners will be either the Friends of Carberry or the proposed
Carberry Trust.

ACTRESS Mary Maddox, whose career was blighted by an application of
greasepaint during a run of The Rocky Horror Show, yesterday won
#187,000 High Court damages.
Miss Maddox, 41, was about to go onstage at the Piccadilly Theatre in
London's West End in November 1990, when she suffered a drastic reaction
to her stage make-up.
The actress, who had two roles in the cult musical -- the Usherette
and Magenta -- discovered afterwards that the pot of ultraviolet
greasepaint she used had a sticker underneath saying ''For hair use
only''.
Mr Justice Waller ruled that the production company, Rocky Horror
London Ltd, of Covent Garden, London, was negligent in using the make-up
on her.
The company is also faced with a costs bill unofficially estimated at
#50,000.
The greasepaint caused chronic irritant contact dermatitis, which left
the actress unable to use any make-up or even water on her face without
suffering blisters and lumps.
This meant she could only accept parts which did not need make-up --
about 25% of those she was offered.
Miss Maddox, who has been nominated for awards for work ranging from
stage classics such as Rocket to the Moon and The House of Bernarda Alba
to television parts in Minder and The Bill, said afterwards: ''I'm
absolutely delighted. This is a health and safety issue. Actors are as
entitled to protection at work as anyone else.''
Miss Maddox said that her eyes swelled up when she put on the
greasepaint. ''As soon as the bright stage lights hit me, they began to
stream, to pour with water.
''I was in great pain. My eyes were burning and felt as though I had
marbles under the lids.''
Martin Brown, head of communications for Equity, the actors' union,
said the damages were a record for an injury to a performer where both
liability and the amount of damages had been contested.

A SUPERMARKET in a jobs blackspot which was due to close today was
reprieved at the eleventh hour by a judge yesterday.
Highland and Universal, landlords of the Wester Hailes Shopping
Centre, on the west side of Edinburgh, successfully secured an interim
interdict against the Argyll Group, stopping it from vacating the
first-floor Presto supermarket, which employs 70 people.
Lord Penrose also ruled at the Court of Session in Edinburgh that the
company -- which had signed a lease not due to expire until March 2009
-- had to keep the store open pending further legal action.
''We will naturally obey the court order and the store will be open on
Tuesday after the bank holiday,'' a spokesman said at Argyll's Middlesex
headquarters last night.
He would not comment on whether the firm planned an appeal against the
19-page judgment, which he said was being examined by legal advisers.
The company claimed in court it would have to recruit new staff to
reopen its doors next week.
Ryden, the chartered surveyors who manage the centre on behalf of the
landlords, said a #12m redevelopment -- including the construction of an
eight-screen cinema and 1200-seat bingo hall -- would not be affected.
The judgment was welcomed by community leaders in the district.
Wester Hailes Councillor Susan Dalgety, who edits the local newspaper,
said: ''This is wonderful news. The problem will be the uncertainty for
workers. It is good that the courts have helped defend Wester Hailes.''
During the hearing Lord Penrose heard that Highland and Universal had
already spent #2.5m on the refurbishment of the centre.
The landlords that warned the Presto supermarket was the ''anchor
store'' for the 40-unit centre, which it was claimed would become
commercially unattractive if the store closed.
But Argyll argued that the centre had been allowed to deteriorate over
the years.
Argyll said it had spent #600,000 in 1992 in an attempt to stem the
decline in custom, but despite that, the store's trading loss for the
last financial year was about #300,000.
But Lord Penrose, in a written judgment, said that what Argyll
proposed to do was at first sight ''a serious and material breach of its
contractual obligations''.

<TEXT>
A FORMER policeman, involved in a land dispute with a titled landlord,
is set to continue his fight, despite suffering a legal setback.
Mr Ian Smart, from Ardvasar, Skye, has been locked in the battle with
Godfrey, Lord Macdonald, Lord of the Isles, over whether the land on
which he has built his house is a croft.
The Scottish Land Court has ruled it is not, and has turned down a
claim for compensation by Mr Smart for improvements he made. However, it
said he was misled by the landlord into believing the holding he began
leasing in 1978 qualified as a croft.
Mr Smart said yesterday the ruling was a blow, but he plans to fight
on. He is still unsure what will happen to the land where he and his
family have lived for 17 years.
Mr Smart, 44, became tenant of the holding at Ardvasar in 1978 and
received crofting grants from the Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries to upgrade it.
In 1991, he sent a request to buy the land to Lord Macdonald, who
initially agreed. But more than a year later, Lord Macdonald wrote again
saying: ''your request is not as simple as it sounds''.
Four months later, Mr Smart spotted a Skye estate agent advertising
the land for sale and was told Lord Macdonald intended selling two house
sites.
Mr Smart told the land court he took up the tenancy in good faith and
claimed the landlord's neglect and bad estate management was to blame
for the mix-up.
But Lord Macdonald's agent, Sir Crispin Agnew, told the court the land
was not a croft as defined in law. This was because, in 1864, the then
Lord Macdonald had leased the land to an innkeeper, who did not qualify
for the status of landowner at the time.
The court ruled there was no evidence to suggest the land was made a
croft subsequently, and did not fall within the Crofters (Scotland) Act
1993.
Lord Macdonald indicated he would not seek expenses if he won the
case, but the court said, even if he had not done so, it would have had
considerable misgivings in granting them.
''The applicant in this case has, through no fault of his own, been
misled by the landlords into the understanding he had obtained the lease
of a holding qualifying as a croft under the 1993 Act.''
Mr Smart said yesterday: ''This is a real blow, but I cannot let it
rest there after 17 years. None of this is my fault.
''I am unsure what will happen now, but I hope it can continue to be
run as a croft, otherwise I have nothing left.''
Contacted at his home in Isle Ornsay, Skye, Lord Macdonald said: ''The
decision is quite clear and I have nothing further to add at all.''

THE long-expected rift between the non-TUC Royal College of Nursing
and the other health unions surfaced yesterday, and it could undermine
peace hopes in the health pay dispute.
The 300,000-member RCN failed to show up at a joint meeting at which
the other unions, together representing some 650,000 NHS staff, agreed
to accept management's offer of exploratory talks to resolve the
long-standing wrangle over pay.
The 13 unions also agreed to co-ordinate plans for industrial action
ballots, and to plan joint action if the talks proved fruitless.
An RCN spokesman said last night that the union was not interested in
pursuing Unison's declared aim of a revised pay structure for all NHS
staff. It would have separate talks with NHS management for a settlement
for nurses based on the retention of their pay review body, which had
''served them well in the past''.
The RCN's refusal to attend the meeting, which appeared to run counter
to the strong feelings demonstrated at the recent RCN delegate
conference, dismayed other union leaders, who accused the RCN of
short-sightedness.
Unison head of health Bob Abberley said he was ''stunned'' and ''very
much regretted'' the move, and appealed to RCN members to urge their
leaders to think again.
He added that he would hold the RCN leadership responsible if possible
talks aimed at averting industrial action broke down.
The unions expect peace talks to be held next month following a
positive response from managers to an olive branch held out by Unison,
but the RCN has indicated it does not want to participate.
Unison has delayed for six weeks before proceeding with a strike
ballot even though its members voted by nine to one in a consultative
ballot against the Government's offer of a 1% national pay rise plus up
to 2% negotiated locally.
Yesterday's split reveals key differences in the unions. The RCN
leadership has accepted the principle of local pay. It wants 3% for all
its members, and will recommend they accept this once a ''critical
mass'' of 300 or so NHS trusts have made offers adding up to 3%.
TUC-affiliated Unison wants to keep national pay awards and is
concerned about the long-term future of pay bargaining. Mr Abberley
admitted that the gulf looked pretty wide and stressed that a ''critical
mass'' was not a solution to problems.
''We want to see a critical path which will take us through this
dispute and to the future. Going for a short-term solution is not the
answer.''
The unions included the Royal College of Midwives; the GMB; the Health
Visitors Association; the Society of Radiographers; and the
Manufacturing, Science, and Finance (MSF) union.
Mr Abberley said they would meet again next week to thrash out a
proper timetable for talks and that a chair would be kept at the table
for the RCN.

LABOUR moved quickly yesterday to dismiss the idea that black
women-only short lists for parliamentary seats are on the cards.
The Conservatives were quick to attack a vote by Labour activists in
London calling for such a list in the Bethnal Green and Stepney
constituency, to be renamed Bethnal Green and Bow when the seat is
vacated at the next election by Mr Peter Shore, who is 71.
A senior Labour Party spokesman said: ''It's not in the rules. It will
not happen.''
But the fact that Labour's London regional committee voted 12-5 for it
had Tory officials asking: ''If all-black women, why not all disabled,
all-gay, all-Asian shortlists?''
Labour Party headquarters said that the party would not accept a
decision from any quarter that an all-women short list should be made up
of members of ethnic minorities alone.
The national executive have suspended the initial stages of selecting
a replacement for Mr Shore. More than 20 people have been nominated for
the safe seat and a front runner is a man -- Dr Nick Fox, the local
party chairman.
Under the party policy that half the replacements for Labour MPs
retiring at the next election must be women, several constituencies
faced being ordered to have only women on their shortlist.

<HEADLINE>Athletics body to consider allowing trackside betting</HEADLINE>

IN one of the most controversial moves in the sport's history, the
British Athletic Federation next week will consider whether to turn back
the clock more than a century by permitting the reintroduction of
trackside betting.
BAF approached bookmakers William Hill for help in funding bonuses for
world records this season. Hill has responded with an offer of 6% of all
athletics bets if permission is granted for a mobile facility at major
meetings.
''This will come before the BAF management board and council next
weekend,'' said spokesman Tony Ward.
Although William Hill sponsored the national 100-kilometre
championship in 1993, betting was strictly banned. Like other companies
it has made a book on the Olympics for many years. But now there is the
prospect of spread-betting on winning times and split times in endurance
races as well as straight wagers on outright winners.
When the Amateur Athletic Association was formed in 1880, and its
Scottish counterpart in 1883, it was largely in response to the rigging
of races involving wagers. In 1887 the stadium at Lillie Bridge, in
London, was wrecked by rioting punters when the handlers of sprinters
Harry Hutchens and Harry Gent failed to agree on who would take a dive
in a race involving a purse of #200.
BAF rules categorically ban betting, although The Herald revealed
exclusively last year that at the European Championships in Helsinki
British 400m gold medallist Du'aine Ladejo had won money by backing
himself after odds had been displayed on the stadium scoreboard. For the
past two years, amateur athletes in Scotland have been able to bet on
themselves at Edinburgh's New Year meeting.
Sir Arthur Gold, former chairman of the European Athletic Association,
and an honorary BAF member who opposes the plan, said: ''There is a
generation of administrator who can see only a quick buck. The moment
you have betting it leaves the way open to all abuses -- it would only
need a bunch of people getting together to fix races to manipulate bets.
The temptation is going to be there.''
Noting that the most efficient anti-doping screening in sport was at
Newmarket, Sir Arthur added: ''Why should we think that men on two feet
are any different to things on four feet?''

A FIREFIGHTER was trapped for almost two hours yesterday after an
aerial platform vehicle in which he was a passenger overturned in
Edinburgh minutes after answering an emergency call.
Mr David McLean, 43, was trapped by the feet in the vehicle, which had
been in service with Lothian and Borders Fire Brigade for only eight
months. The accident happened at a roundabout in Calder Road shortly
after it left Sighthill Fire Station.
It was attending an incident at Murrayburn Grove in nearby Wester
Hailes, which turned out to be a small fire in a drying area.
Mr McLean was taken to Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary, where he was
detained for treatment to a broken ankle. Firefighter Alex Sinclair, who
was driving the vehicle, escaped injury.
An investigation is under way into the accident. A spokesman for the
brigade said last night: ''We have no indication as to why the vehicle
overturned. Initially our own brigade engineer will investigate it.''
Last night a witness told how his two-year-old son, who regularly
watches from a window of his home for fire vehicles coming from the
Sighthill Fire Station, burst out crying when he saw it overturn on its
side.
Mr Leslie McArthur, 24, a painter-decorator of Broomview House,
Sighthill, said that after calming his son, Leroy, he went to the
roundabout to see if he could help the occupants of the vehicle, which
he said ''rattled off a fence''.
He said another fire unit arrived on the scene shortly afterwards and
the windscreen was pulled out.
''The paramedics who arrived were inside with the trapped man for a
long time cutting bits off the vehicle and treating him with drips,'' he
said.

FORMER Rangers player Duncan Ferguson is to be reported to the sheriff
at Cupar in Fife for breaching his probation, raising the possibility
that he could face an additional sentence to the three months imposed at
Glasgow Sheriff Court on Thursday.
The chances of an additional sentence are remote, since Sheriff
Alexander Eccles at Glasgow, in jailing Ferguson for three months for
head-butting Raith Rovers defender John McStay, would have already been
aware that Ferguson was on probation from another court.
It is possible, however, that Ferguson's latest offence could land him
in trouble should Sheriff Charles Smith at Cupar decide that he must
appear before him again. When he placed Ferguson on probation in August
1993 -- for assaulting a fisherman in an Anstruther bar -- Sheriff Smith
warned him to stay out of trouble for a year. Eight months later the
head-butting incident took place at Ibrox Park.
Because Ferguson's home was then in Stirling, the Fife court passed
the probation order to Central Regional Council's social work
department.
A spokeswoman at Central Regional Council yesterday confirmed that it
had carried out its legal obligation by reporting Ferguson to its
counterpart in Fife, adding: ''It is now up to the sheriff . . . If he
starts breach of probation proceedings he could recall Ferguson and
sentence him for the original assault.''

THE new president of the Law Society of Scotland yesterday warned that
his members would fight to maintain legal aid for those most in need.
Speaking at his inauguration address to the society's council in
Edinburgh yesterday, the president, Mr Alan Boyd, 41, of Ayr, said that
legal aid was the most important issue facing the profession in the
1990s and he urged solicitors to bring forward considered views on
Government plans for reform.
He said: ''We have a duty to ensure that the poor and needy members of
the public are not denied legal aid and so denied proper professional
legal advice and representation.''
The profession also had to respond to public wishes, including the
demand for some kind of Scottish Assembly, added Mr Boyd.
''If the Scottish legal system is to be equipped to face the
developments and challenges which will arise as we approach the next
millenium, the Government must provide adequate resources for
legislative change,'' he said.

STAFF at a leading research institute in Aberdeen, the only centre of
its kind in Scotland, were last night facing the prospect of its
closure.
An announcement about the future of the Torry Research Station, which
employs more than 100 people, is expected early next month. Westminster
sources have suggested it could be shut, and its research role
transferred to a new, purpose-built centre in Derby, which is costing
more than #100m and is due to open next year.
The possible move was last night condemned by Opposition politicians
in Scotland, who described it as a disgraceful betrayal. Last year,
junior Minister Nicholas Soames told staff at Torry there were no plans
to transfer their work to Derby.
However, any campaign to save the Aberdeen site looks doomed to
failure. It is run by one of the Government's executive agencies, and no
legislation would be required to close it.
The Torry Research Station established an international reputation for
marine and fisheries work before it was changed into a food safety
laboratory in 1990.
Last year, along with a sister centre in Norwich, it was merged with
the Central Science Laboratory (CSL), whose 11 branches in England are
due to be centralised at Derby.
The Torry and Norwich centres were originally excluded from that
restructuring, but their position has now been reexamined by CSL's chief
executive, Dr Peter Stanley.
He was not prepared to comment yesterday, but a spokeswoman for the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said: ''The Minister
(William Waldegrave) is carefully considering the future of the whole
agency, following a report from its chief executive.
''No decision has yet been taken, but an announcement is expected
soon. The Scottish Office is fully involved in the consideration of this
matter.''
It is understood that Mr Waldegrave will unveil the contents of a
business plan for the CSL on June 6, when the Commons resumes after the
Whitsun recess.
Union officials representing the Torry staff were not prepared to
comment in advance of his announcement, but are privately thought to be
fearing the worst.
It has been suggested by other sources that the Torry station has
fared relatively badly in the cut-throat battle to win commercial
contracts.
Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond said: ''If closure is
announced, it will be a total breach of faith, and the Minister's words
last year will prove to be yet another paper guarantee which is worth
absolutely nothing in the hands of this Government, and particularly the
Scottish Secretary.''
Such a development would be ominous for the future status of Scottish
Nuclear, which is due to be privatised as part of a UK body, said Mr
Salmond.
Dr Gavin Strang, the Shadow agriculture spokesman, said: ''If Torry
closes, it would be a scandal. Year in, year out, this Government has
cut research expenditure, and some of the biggest losers have been in
agriculture and food research.
''In the long term, the price will be paid by the industry, but in the
short term valuable employment is being sacrificed unjustifiably.''
South Aberdeen Conservative MP Raymond Robertson yesterday refused to
make any criticism of the possible closure, saying it would be wrong to
pre-empt a Ministerial announcement.
* The Marine Laboratory in Torry, which is part of the Scottish
Fisheries Department, is a separate institute and is not involved in the
Ministerial review.

THE new single-tier Fife Council is to set up a Citizenship Commission
to monitor the workings of local democracy.
Labour leader Alex Rowley said yesterday the new councils must resist
the temptation simply to put into place new versions of old systems.
They must move closer to the people.
Councillor Rowley told a conference in Perth he believed local
government in the past did not develop ''systems within the councils
which ensured that the workforce and local people felt some sense of
ownership of those councils.
''I believe this has led to the isolation of the councils and
ultimately the separation from the communities which they were meant to
serve.''
To try to put this right in Fife, he said, a member-led working group
has been set up which would examine all aspects of citizen involvement
and would put in place the widest possible consultation to be carried
out in Fife in terms of local government.
The new Citizenship Commission would review and report on the effects
of the democratic structures put in place by the new council.
The conference was sponsored by Achieving Quality, a consultancy which
helps councils implement quality management systems.

HEARTS chairman Chris Robinson has welcomed a deal in which the club
awarded long-term food and drink concessions at Tynecastle to his own
catering company, Wheatsheaf Catering.
He declined to disclose how much Hearts' direct income would benefit
from Wheatsheaf's successful tender, citing client confidentiality
between supplier and club.
Mr Robinson would neither confirm nor deny that, under the deal,
Hearts will receive #9500 from Wheatsheaf for the catering rights at the
stadium over the past season -- compared with at least #20,000-a-year
paid by the same firm before his takeover of Hearts.
It is also alleged that the club had rejected at least one offer which
was worth #30,000-a-year from a rival firm for the catering concessions.
Mr Robinson insisted that all other tenders had not included a
long-term investment package designed to improve the catering facilities
at Tynecastle, which is undergoing redevelopment.
Wheatsheaf, he said, would invest between #100,000 and #150,000 on
services and facilities over the next five years at the stadium,
including ''hi-tech kiosks''.
Mr Robinson added: ''It offered significant capital expenditure in
equipment and kiosks . . . a financial input which the club could not
afford. It was put forward and accepted on that basis as a total and
better package.''
Wheatsheaf Catering, founded by Mr Robinson and his wife 17 years ago,
operates out of Hopetoun House in South Queensferry. It has a
multi-million pound turnover and more than 100 employees.
It reputedly paid #20,000, then #21,000, for the catering at Hearts in
the two years before Mr Robinson and lawyer Leslie Deans took charge of
the club last summer.
A decision on who was to be awarded the latest contract coincided with
Mr Wallace Mercer selling his majority shareholding in the club for
almost #2m.
Crawford Bakers confirmed yesterday that it had tendered for the
contract, which not only includes selling pies and Bovrils to fans but
providing corporate hospitality involving hundreds of meals.
Crawford's bid was worth an estimated #30,000-a-year over two years to
the club. A spokesman for the Leith-based firm said: ''We did tender for
the Hearts contract. We did not get it for reasons that we do not know
about. We win some, we lose some.''
Mr Robinson said he was not party to the board meeting at which the
Wheatsheaf tender was accepted. He confirmed that it was the only bid
put before the board for consideration because of its contents as a
total package.

PARENTS have been warned once again to be vigilant after another
report of a bogus health visitor.
The latest case involves a person who called at a house in Tarbolton,
Ayrshire.
Ayrshire and Arran Community Health Care NHS Trust said the woman, who
used the name of Karen or Fiona and was driving a red Vauxhall Nova,
asked to speak to a woman and her child who live in the house.
The bogus health visitor was told by a female relative that neither
the woman nor the child were home and she said she would return.
The NHS trust's health visiting service was alerted when she did not
call again. The woman, who made no attempt to provide identification,
did not gain access to the house.
Mrs Celia McQueen, community services manager at the NHS trust, said
that although there had been no other reported incidents, parents should
be on their guard in case the woman called at another house.
She also urged anyone with any knowledge of a woman matching the
description to contact the police as soon as possible.
The woman was described as being small and slim with streaked blonde
hair and in her early 30s.
0 Mrs McQeen said: ''All Ayrshire and Arran community health care
staff carry identification and they encourage their clients and patients
to ask any caller to show their identification.
''Should someone presenting themslves as a health care visitor not
present identification, or should the parent or guardian become
suspicious, they should report the incident and check with their current
health care contact for confirmation of identification and contact the
local police immediately.''
An official of Strathclyde Police confirmed that they were
investigating the incident.
Last month, police in Glasgow and Edinburgh investigated failed
attempts by suspected child-abductors who claimed to be social workers.
Other incidents have been reported in Ayrshire and Lanarkshire but Mrs
McQueen said there was nothing to suggest a link with Thursday's
incident.
* A 48 year-old man was yesterday in police custody in connection with
an incident in which a 22-year-old woman was allegedly called on at her
home in the Yorkhill area of Glasgow by a man purporting to be a project
worker.
Fife Police are investigating reports that a woman claiming to be a
health visitor called at a Kirkcaldy house yesterday and asked the
female householder if she could examine a young child.

A WOMAN died and a man was airlifted to hospital after a crash between
a car and an articulated lorry on the A713 Castle Douglas-Ayr road
yesterday.
The crash happened on a corner about half-a-mile north of Carsphairn
village. Firefighters from Strathclyde and Dumfries and Galloway
attended the scene.
The woman is thought to have died instantly. Her body had to be cut
free from the wreckage.
The man, who was seriously injured, was freed by members of the
public. He was given emergency treatment by medics before being taken by
helicopter to hospital in Ayr.
The road was partially blocked for several hours as police cleared the
crash site.
The lorry driver was uninjured, but was treated for shock.
* Meanwhile the death toll in the M4 British Legion coach crash rose
to 12 yesterday when two more passengers died in hospital.
Both had been on the ''critical'' list in the intensive care unit of
Bristol's Frenchay hospital.
One was a 62-year-old man from Christchurch, Dorset, who had been on a
life-support system since Tuesday.
The other was a 72-year-old woman from Southbourne, who had suffered
chest and head injuries.
Seven other injured passengers were in Bristol hospitals yesterday.
One man was causing concern, his condition described as ''serious but
stable''.
An inquest into the deaths is due to open in Bristol on Wednesday.

THE first woman to scale Everest alone and without oxygen was on her
way home to the Highlands early this morning with the twin peaks of an
emotional family reunion and a mountain of media work to climb.
Alison Hargreaves conquered 29,028ft Everest without Sherpa help on
May 13, making her only the second person in history to climb the
world's highest mountain unaided.
The 33-year-old adventurer was expected to arrive at her home in Spean
Bridge in the wee small hours. She is driving up from Glasgow Airport
with a posse of minders after arriving from London on the last shuttle.
A few years ago Ms Hargreaves was so broke she had to think twice
about buying a bottle of shampoo to wash her hair after climbing the
Matterhorn. But now she is the darling of the international media and
courted and escorted by prospective sponsors among the multinational
companies.
She is expected to spend only 10 days at home before heading off on
another record-breaking expedition. She is planning to travel back to
the Himalayas for an attempt at climbing the notorious 28,250ft K2,
again solo and without oxygen support -- another first for a woman.
Her husband, Jim Ballard, 49, said feelings would be running high when
the family was reunited this morning. Ms Hargreaves last saw him and her
children Kate, six, and Tom, three, on March 28.
Mr Ballard said: ''As a family we have never got emotional about
Alison's climbing, but there will certainly be a lot of feelings shown
when we all meet up. ''She may have a tear for one of the children but
then it will be time to get on with the media circus.''
Mr Ballard said the family had been snowed under with requests for
television, radio, and press interviews while offers of sponsorship were
pouring in.
He said: ''North American television wants as much of Alison as it can
get. She has caught the imagination of the man in the street over there
because of her resemblance to an eccentric English explorer.
''It's as if she picked up her rucksack and said bye Jim, bye Kate,
bye Tom, and then got in touch to say that she just happened to be on
top of Everest.
''Her diary is nearly full. Every major player wants her on their
show. Sir David Frost wants to interview her twice -- in one instance to
have breakfast with her as she sets off for K2.''
Apart from TV they have also been bombarded with requests from
magazines such as Der Spiegel, Paris Match, and Hello. ''Pepsi wants to
underwrite her next two expeditions.''
It was all in marked contrast to two or three years ago, said Mr
Ballard. ''I used to have to count the money to see if we could go into
a Swiss supermarket to buy a loaf of bread at #4. We were skint in those
days when we were climbing the Matterhorn.
''I remember after scaling the mountain that Alison just had enough to
buy the cheapest shampoo to wash her hair and get two croissants.
''Our celebration dinner was paid for by a Dutch couple who couldn't
believe we couldn't afford to buy a bottle of wine. It turned into a
marvellous al fresco affair in the local camp site.''
Meanwhile, Ms Hargreaves will relive her Everest expedition at a news
conference in Fort William today.

THE Queen yesterday marked her first visit to Aberdeen University in
35 years by touring the new and the old.
She unveiled a plaque at the site of the new #25m Institute of Medical
Sciences building.
The institute, currently under construction, aims to provide a world-
class research facility within one of Europe's largest integrated
healthcare complexes at Foresterhill. The first phase of the project is
due for completion early next year.
The Queen then joined staff and students at King's College in Old
Aberdeen -- founded in 1495 -- at a ceremony to mark the quincentenary
celebrations of Scotland's third oldest university.
Her last official engagement at the university was to open the
university's first hall of residence in 1960.
Yesterday, university Principal Maxwell Irvine made a speech of
welcome at King's College Chapel in the front of an invited audience of
over 200 guests, including Scottish Office Minister Lord Fraser of
Carmyllie and Lord Provost James Wyness.
The Queen accepted a gift of a bed of Bishop Elphinstone
''Quincentenary'' roses to be planted at Balmoral.
Later she viewed an exhibition of manuscripts and early printed books
from the university's library, including the Foundation Bull dating from
February 10, 1495.

TORIES are considering changes to their Scottish organisation
following a series of setbacks culminating in the loss of Perth and
Kinross to the SNP, but senior figures denied yesterday that there was
any question of changing their name to the Scottish Unionist Party.
This suggestion, mooted in a London newspaper, is not being
considered, party chairman Sir Michael Hirst insisted yesterday, but he
did concede that in sticking by its opposition to constitutional change
the party would have to find ways of improving its ability to promote
its policies and achievements.
All sides sought to take something from the aftermath of the victory
by SNP candidate Roseanna Cunningham, who overturned the 2094 majority
of the late Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, taking the seat 7311 votes ahead of
Labour in second place, pushing the Tories into third place a further
630 votes behind, and cutting the Government's majority to nine.
While it was the SNP's first every by-election capture from the
Conservatives, their share of just over 40% of the poll was less than
polls had indicated. Scottish Secretary Ian Lang tried to put the best
gloss on the defeat, describing it as ''comfortably the least bad'' of
the by-elections in the current Parliament.
He said the SNP's overall vote had fallen since the General Election,
and he dismissed the Nationalists' claim that the result was a vote for
Scottish independence. Mr Lang brushed aside suggestions that the party
might try to counter its unpopularity in Scotland by dropping the word
''Conservative'' from its name and allowing candidates to campaign as
Unionists.
''We are proud of the fact that we have the word 'Unionist' in our
title, but we are not talking about changing our brand name during a
period of unpopularity,'' he said.
Sir Michael Hirst suggested that one way the party would try to get
over its message more effectively was through the creation of its own
newspaper. He said: ''There is a very major consultation going on
between the party and its grass roots and the wider electorate.''
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson said that finding 3400
extra voters at a time when the SNP had dropped by 1000 from the last
General Election was Labour's best Scottish by-election performance
since the war and one of its best in Britain.
Both Labour and SNP said that, with the kind of swings recorded on
Thursday, Scotland could be a Tory-free zone after the next election.
The new MP herself said her victory had reopened the door of
constitutional opportunity for Scotland and her role in Europe and the
world.
Scottish Liberal Democrat candidate Veronica Linklater said her party
had done well to increase their vote and avoid a squeeze. Mrs Linklater
said: ''The Tories' failure to listen time and again to the Scottish
people has cause their vote to crumble.''

ANOTHER row over directors' shareholdings was brewing last night after
a National Power executive sold 95,000 shares on the Stock Exchange.
Mr Colin Webster, managing director of the UK business of National
Power, held 115,000 shares under his earnings package. He sold 95,000 at
#4.69 each.
Shadow Trade and Industry spokesman Nigel Griffiths accused National
Power of trying to avoid publicity over the deal by announcing it as the
Stock Exchange was closing for the Bank Holiday weekend.
''It's a Bank Holiday bonanza for this man,'' said Mr Griffiths. ''The
announcement was made just as brokers and journalists were getting ready
for the weekend and indicates National Power felt it had something to
hide.''
He said there should be an immediate freeze on share option deals
until after Parliament considers the issue.
''The people who run these low risk monopoly companies are completely
ignoring the Prime Minister's request for restraint,'' he said.
A spokesman for National Power confirmed the share sale.
He said: ''Mr Webster has exercised part of the share options which
were granted to him. The deal was completed today and we were not trying
to conceal anything. It was reported under the rules of the Stock
Exchange.''
The controversy follows the disclosure that National Grid executives
had used a ''tax loophole'' to transfer thousands of shares to their
wives.

A SUMMER of rail chaos and disruption loomed larger yesterday when
leaders of the industry's biggest union -- the Rail, Maritime and
Transport union (RMT) -- rejected a ''final'' 3% pay offer and called a
strike ballot.
The unanimous decision by the executive of the RMT follows a similar
move on Thursday night by leaders of the train drivers' union Aslef.
Both unions are urging their members to endorse a series of 24-hour
stoppages which are likely to be co-ordinated to cause maximum
disruption in support of their demands for 6% and ''substantially above
inflation'' respectively.
British Rail yesterday urged its 77,000 employees involved in the
dispute not to inflict more ''misery'' on rail travellers after last
year's signalworkers' strikes and insisted there would be no improvement
on the offer of 3%.
Personnel director, Mr Paul Watkinson, said the offer was ''generous''
compared with other public sector deals and called on rail employees to
think ''long and hard'' before voting to strike.
The company will now write to employees explaining the offer in full.
Mr Watkinson said he was confident the vast majority would reject
industrial action.
The RMT's general secretary, Mr Jimmy Knapp, said the union wanted a
6% rise. Mr Watkinson claimed Mr Knapp was ''living in cloud cuckoo
land'' if he thought BR could meet that claim.
Mr Knapp retorted that the BR board was ''living in dreamland'' if it
expected workers to accept a sub-inflation rise two years running.
A 3% rise would add #55m to BR's pay bill and Mr Watkinson said he had
a ''gut feeling'' the unions were willing to settle for a rise around
the current inflation rate of 3.3%. But he insisted that the 3% offer
was ''fair and final''.
Mr Watkinson denied there had been any Government intervention, but
said he was currently visiting the Department of Transport ''at least
once a day''.
He added: ''At the end of the day it is a matter for the BR board to
decide where it will stick. I have a long tradition that when I say it
is a final offer, I mean it.''
He promised that BR, which stood to lose revenue of up to #10m for
each strike day, would do everything possible to keep services running
during any stoppages.
This is the last national pay round for BR workers before the industry
is sold off. Mr Watkinson said he did not believe industrial action
would affect privatisation. His view is not shared by union leaders who
insist, however, that the dispute is not politically motivated.
Ballot papers on strike action will be sent out within the next week,
to be returned on July 7, with any industrial action going ahead in
mid-July. Aslef ballot papers are to be returned by June 26.

THE controversial Free Church of Scotland theologian, the Rev
Professor Donald Macleod, last night spoke to The Herald of his relief
after a 10-year long ''whispering campaign'' against him was finally
buried.
Speaking at length for the first time since unspecified allegations
surfaced, he told The Herald he bore no grudge against those who made
them, but would not be drawn on their nature.
''I have no bitterness towards any of them. I think they were sincere,
if misguided,'' he said, sitting in his Morningside home, surrounded by
hundreds of cards of support and with his family at hand.
He said the ordeal had not not shaken his faith in God, but it ''has
certainly shaken my faith in Christians''.
After two days of deliberations, the church's General Assembly in
Edinburgh reaffirmed its decision that there was no evidence, capable of
proving in the court of the church, of censurable conduct on his part.
The unspecified allegations have never been made public, but after
more than nine hours of debate into alleged conduct of the professor,
who has repeatedly claimed he was the victim of a smear campaign, the
Moderator, the Rev Murdo Alex Macleod, emerged to issue a strongly
worded statement to waiting media.
After confirming the decision, he declared: ''The matter is now
closed, and anyone seeking to pursue it further does so at the risk of
being themselves censured as slanderers.''
Professor Macleod was said earlier this week to have been at the
centre of inquiries by Lothian and Borders Police, who confirmed that a
report would be submitted to the procurator-fiscal.
He admitted to The Herald that if the Assembly failed to lay to rest
allegations against him which were originally dismissed, he would have
to consider his future carefully. He said last night he had no plans to
quit the church. ''At the moment I certainly feel committed. I have no
plans to leave at the moment.''
He spoke of the nightmare of the 10-year ordeal which culminated in
yesterday's decision.
''It is a relentless application of pressure. Just when you think it's
over, it takes a new twist. You have got to summon up new resources to
deal with it, '' he said.
''I can't tell of the extent it has changed my personality. It has
really meant I have lost 10 years of my life.
''It has not shaken my faith in God. It has certainly shaken my faith
in Christians.''
Professor Macleod was at his desk in the Free Church College when word
was broken that he had been vindicated by the 80-strong gathering of his
church, only a few yards from where he sat.
''The result was as I expected it to be. Nevertheless, when it
happens, it has its own trauma. I had received the news when one of my
most senior colleagues walked in and he was very overcome with emotion.
I was also overcome with emotion.
''One of the lady members of staff came in and she was overcome. The
place was awash with tears for a while.''
He said his wife, Mary and sons John, 29, a Herald columnist, Murdo ,
27, and Angus, 25, had coped better than expected with the ordeal of the
church hearing hanging over him.
Hundreds of messages of support have poured into the Macleod home from
friends in the last few weeks.
His delighted wife spoke of the family's happiness of the decision.
She described how their minister, the Rev Alex MacDonald of Buccleuch
and Greyfriars, had called her at work with the news only minutes before
her husband telephoned himself to break the news they had all been
waiting for.
''I was very calm all day and very conscious that people were thinking
of us. My faith would have been let down if it hadn't gone the way I was
wishing,'' she said.
Mrs Macleod spoke of the tremendous support the family had received,
particularly in recent weeks and said she felt no animosity to those
behind the claims.
Professor Macleod said they would be attending a prayer meeting of
thanksgiving with friends in Edinburgh and expected to have several
meetings of such a nature.
All presbyteries of the Free Kirk will now be informed of the
decision, the Moderator said.
He insisted that he could see no drift of membership from the church,
because there was no rift.
In a prepared statement, Professor Macleod thanked his wife and family
for their support, and the ''thousands'' who had prayed, now that the
matter was closed.
He has held the chair of systematic theology at Free Church College in
Edinburgh since 1978. It was believed in church circles that antagonism
was caused by certain elements of the church membership opposed to his
liberal views.
After the announcement by the Moderator, Professor Macleod's son John
said his father would now reflect on his position over the weekend.

<HEADLINE>Human war shields. ato poised for Bosnia invasion to cover UN pull-out</HEADLINE>

THOUSANDS of Nato troops were on alert last night after Bosnian Serbs
chained three UN peacekeepers to an ammunition dump, using them as human
shields.
They were prepared to cover the withdrawal of UN forces. More than
50,000 men could intervene ''within hours'' if necessary. They include
US troops stationed in Germany and could mark the first direct
intervention by American ground units in the three-year-old civil war.
A Royal Navy carrier was heading for the area to rendezvous with a
task force.
The alert was triggered by the seizure of a Russian, a Czech, and a
Canadian, two of whom were handcuffed to metal bars at the entrance to
an ammunition bunker, and one to the door itself. The bunker, containing
artillery shells, lies east of the Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale.
Another five UN observers were chained up, and television showed one,
a Pole, handcuffed to a radar site and two others chained to a bridge.
A further 200 UN peacekeepers guarding weapons' storage sites and
observation posts have been surrounded. The Serbs have threatened to
kill them if Nato launches more air strikes against their positions. Up
to 30 of them, all French, were disarmed and taken to an unknown
destination.
A Bosnian Serb leader, Momcilo Krajisnik, said the detained UN
soldiers would be tried for guiding Nato planes to targets. ''The United
Nations should be worried,'' he warned. ''We can't be kind to those who
behave as enemies toward us.''
France was so angered by the moves it has threatened to withdraw all
its troops if the UN did not take measures to protect them. French
President Jacques Chirac telephoned UN Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali to say he wanted a ''new mandate . . . which would take
into consideration the blue helmets on the ground''.
The Security Council was last night meeting in emergency session.
Two raids were mounted by alliance aircraft against an ammunition
store in a forest near Sarajevo yesterday after the Serbs disobeyed a UN
ultimatum to hand back commandeered heavy weapons and cease the shelling
of protected civilian areas.
The biggest naval build-up since the Gulf war was under way last night
as the French aircraft carrier Foch, with 30 strike planes, and Royal
Navy carrier HMS Illustrious with eight Sea Harriers headed for the
Adriatic.
The RN task force will rendezvous with the destroyer HMS Glasgow and
the frigates Boxer and Battleaxe later today. The main threat to the
naval presence comes from Serb aircraft at bases on the Montenegran
coast.
The carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt with a further 100 aircraft is due
in the area this morning. Its attack group will reinforce the 80 allied
fighters and fighter-bombers stationed at airfields on the Italian
coast, 20 minutes' flying time from targets in the former Yugoslavia.
US Defence Secretary William Perry has said that ''overwhelming
force'' would be used against the Bosnian Serbs if they fail to comply
with UN demands.
Shelling of five out of six ''safe'' areas such as Tuzla in
north-eastern Bosnia have killed at least 71 civilians and wounded 150
in the last two days. UN installations have also come under fire.
The defiance by the Serbs of the US Defence Secretary and Nato
escalated yesterday with the direct threats to UN troops on the ground.
Between 20 and 30 soldiers at each of five weapons' collection points
around Sarajevo were surrounded and have been told that they will be
shot if they attempt to leave.
A platoon of 30 Canadian troops was also besieged at an observation
post in a western suburb of the city, and a Serb tank has its gun
trained on French soldiers at Krivoglavic a few miles away.
As the test of wills between the Bosnian Serbs and the UN increased,
Serb forces also cut electricity and water supplies to Sarajevo.
The three UN soldiers being used as human shields belong to UNMO, the
mobile teams which monitor military activity among the warring factions.
The 48 unarmed officers and men are particularly vulnerable. All sides
regard them as spies.
A senior Nato source in Brussels said last night that contingency
plans for a withdrawal of all or part of the UN Protection Force in
Bosnia had been completed, and that up to 55,000 troops could begin
covering operations ''within hours'' if necessary. Up to half of the
combat troops committed to the task would be American.
Any pull-out would be protected by a taxi-rank of fighter-bombers
which could be called down to deliver bomb or missile attacks on anyone
interfering with UN convoys on their long retreat to the Croatian coast.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Major made a joint plea to
Russian leader Boris Yeltsin to intervene to halt Serb aggression. In
Washington, President Clinton also said Mr Yeltsin should use his
influence to get Bosnian Serbs to stop their aggression.
Meanwhile, a Scots father and son working for a charity operating in
Bosnia were last night said to be among those under threat in Tuzla.
Mr Murray Butchard, the 40-year-old transport manager of Scottish
European Aid who is in charge of a fleet of 20 trucks, and his
technician son Mark were said for the moment to be safe and well. During
the attack a shell landed close to the headquarters in Tuzla of SEA
which has been involved in Bosnia since 1993.
In Scotland Nikkie du Preez, the only non-Bosnian director of Bosnia
Now, along with several volunteers, will stage a 24-hour vigil next week
as part of a campaign aimed at raising awareness of the Bosnian
refugees.
