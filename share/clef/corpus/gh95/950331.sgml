Ross Finlay takes care of the Merc family baby
WHILE much of the press coverage of certain makes is concentrated on
their top of the range sporting or super-luxury models, because these
are much more glamorous to write about, the big-volume turnover usually
comes from more ordinary cars.
That is why models like the Mercedes C180 are considerably more
significant than their press cutting books suggest.
With four petrol engines and two diesels on the list, the C-class
extends as far as a 2.8-litre 16-valve six-cylinder which peaks at
193bhp. If it goes the same way as other Mercedes model ranges, as far
as residuals are concerned, the diesels are likely to have top-ranking
trade-in values. They should be fine long-term investments, with the
petrol versions not far behind.
The C180 in either Classic or Esprit specification is the entry-level
model of the whole vast Mercedes range. Its showroom price is #17,980,
either as an Esprit with lowered suspension and cloth trim, or in
Classic form like the test car. The specification includes anti-lock
brakes, a driver's airbag, an engine immobiliser, side-to-side
temperature controls, and a well-judged power steering system as
standard, but German companies are rarely over-lavish with equipment.
Mercedes radios are always extra-cost options. Even the front central
armrest with storage box costs an added #170, but the raise-up child
seats in the rear compartment were reasonable as an #186 extra.
The Classic has a familiar and neatly-presented Mercedes exterior
appearance, entirely without brightwork. Inside, the fascia is effective
but not impressive, looking less of a good fit than it actually is. All
the seats are very firm but, while they seem rather unyielding on a
short journey, they offer plenty of support on a longer run.
One inescapable fact about the C180 is that, being a sizeable car with
a 122bhp engine, and only moderate torque levels, it is by no means a
sporty performer unless really pushed. Standstill to 60mph takes about
12 seconds but, although the test track maximum is close to 120mph, it
runs out of puff when left in a high gear either in an overtaking
manoeuvre or on a climb.
On a run to Inverness and back, the test car did not seem very
responsive on the A9 unless taken down the box and revved quite hard.
One disadvantage of this is that the manual gearchange is an uninspiring
affair, with a clonky movement which surely cannot be necessary.
On the other hand, when Mercedes makes engines of any kind, it
designs, builds and balances them properly. As the test car was revved
round the dial, it swept up beyond 6000rpm without the slightest sign of
strain.
That treatment, of course, does not benefit the fuel consumption.
Running at steady speeds the C180 should be good for about 44mpg at
56mph and 34 at 75, compared with 25mpg around town.
The Mercedes showed up much better on a later trip through Ayrshire,
when I travelled along the quieter kind of B-class roads where, if the
truth be told, the best driving in southern Scotland is usually to be
found. On a winding route by Crosshands and Tarbolton, Crosshill and the
Girvan valley, the C180 was suddenly in its element.
All its fine handling balance, excellent steering, poise and ride
quality came to the fore. Dips, humps, S-bends and climbing corners
allowed it to show its thoroughbred paces, although nothing made it
clear why this manual transmission car should have that clumsy
foot-operated parking brake system which makes hill starts such a pesky
business.

WHEN Rangers take on a Rangers International Select in a testimonial
match for Scott Nisbet at Ibrox on May 1, there will be one face missing
which will touch everyone connected with Scottish football.
Davie Cooper, who died in tragic circumstances last week, had planned
to make his farewell to Scottish football on Nisbet's big night, and, as
a mark of respect to the former Rangers and Scotland great, nobody will
wear the No.11 jersey for the select side that night.
Football agent Bill McMurdo said yesterday: ''Davie Cooper was the
first former Rangers player to be approached to take part in Scott's
testimonial match, and he was so keen to help promote the event. He also
told us that it would be a fitting occasion on which to make his final
appearance in Scottish football.
''As a tribute to Davie, there will be no No.11 shirt worn and the
committee also plan to donate a sum of money to the neurological
department of the Southern General Hospital.''
The stars gathered at Ibrox yesterday to get behind the testimonial
for 27-year-old Nisbet, who had to give up the game two years ago
because of a hip injury.
Terry Butcher, Mo Johnston, Ally McCoist, Richard Gough, and Ian
Ferguson were among those who showed their support for their former
colleague, whose last match for the club was against Celtic at Parkhead
in March, 1993, just three days after he had scored a remarkable (lucky)
goal against Bruges in the European Champions' League.
And there was a moment of humour when Rangers PR officer, John Greig,
introduced the proceedings by announcing: ''We are here to welcome
Maurice Johnston back to the club. He's having a testimonial -- but we
don't know at which ground to hold it.''
However, the day belonged to Nisbet, and Terry Butcher, who will
captain the select side, said: ''It will be a great thrill for me to
come back to play at Ibrox, and for such a good cause. Scott thoroughly
deserves this, because he has had such a short career.''
Others who will turn out on the night are Johnston, Ray Wilkins,
Graham Roberts, Terry Hurlock, Gary Stevens, Jimmy Nicholl, Robert
Fleck, Nigel Spackman, and John Spencer. In all, more than 20 former
Rangers have expressed a desire to play.
Said Johnston: ''Scott always gave 100% and was a Rangers fan. I know
for sure that when Graeme Souness was manager he had several offers for
Scott, but he didn't want to leave. He had a great affinity with the
fans here and will always be remembered for that goal against Bruges.''
Ally McCoist, who already has benefitted from a bumper testimonial,
said: ''The fans certainly didn't let me down and I know they will rally
around Scott. These fans are the most loyal in the country.''
Tickets for the match are priced from #5 to #12 and the public sale
will begin on Wednesday, April 19.
Meantime, John Brown could be set for a lifetime role at Ibrox. I
understand the 33-year-old defender will be offered a dual playing and
coaching role.
He is favourite to take over the reserve-team backroom job left vacant
by Billy Kirkwood's move to manage Dundee United.

ONE of Scotland's top seed potato breeding companies yesterday
defended court action taken against growers who tried to avoid paying
royalties on crops grown for seed.
Earlier this month a father and son farming partnership in
Aberdeenshire were fined #2750 at Aberdeen Sheriff Court for failing to
secure official certification of their crop. They will also have to pay
up to #30,000 to the Dutch breeder of the Estima variety in compensation
for unpaid royalties.
Gordon Smillie, a director of Caithness Potatoes Ltd, Perth, took
issue with any suggestion that the outcome of the court proceedings was
unfair.
''Scotland is renowned for the quality of its seed potatoes and for
the innovation of its plant breeders,'' he said. ''Quality and
innovation must be paid for, however, and in the world of seed potatoes
that means the maintenance of certified seed varieties and plant
royalties.
''Unless we have a properly managed, policed and financed seed potato
industry the whole trade will collapse, and Scotland will lose a rich
research and development resource which is respected throughout the
world. To suggest, as some have during the past two weeks, that the
current seed potato rules and regulations are loaded against the
commercial farmer is ignorant nonsense.''
Mr Smillie said that his company worked in close partnership with many
farmers throughout Scotland and England to develop varieties which added
new qualities to what was already available in the market place.
''For every successful variety we produce there are at least 100
potential varieties which never go beyond the trials field,'' he said.
''The vast majorty of farmers appreciate what we are doing and recognise
that they are successful when we are successful. We don't rob them and
they don't rob us.''
Farmers who didn't want to pay the royalty fees were at perfect
liberty to buy alternatives or to grow unprotected varieties, he said.
''Those who are brought to court for breaking the laws of the land
must be seen for what they are -- illegal operators who are eating away
at the roots of a valuable Scottish industry. They are operating purely
for personal gain, and their actions can only damage the profitability
of plant breeders and farmers alike.''

RUSSIA coach Oleg Romantsev has long been an admirer of the team
spirit which Scotland can conjure up for important games. The other
night in Moscow he found out just how important that could be.
After the 0-0 draw in Moscow, Romantsev confirmed the importance of
the collective will of the Scottish players. It was something he feared
before the game, and now it has become a possible barrier for his
country in the fight for a place in the European Championship finals in
England next year.
''I have always maintained that Scotland, because of their will to
win, and because of their determination, would always be a danger in
this group,'' he said. ''I thought that they would be more difficult
opponents than the Greeks.
''Now, I know my instincts were correct. People kept telling me we
would qualify, that we will win the group. Even the Scottish coach,
Craig Brown, said so.
''That is not so certain now. We have difficult games ahead, and in
the two games against Scotland we shared the points. This was a major
opportunity for us. It was the chance for the players to push themselves
towards the finals.
''They did not take that opportunity. They let themselves down because
they did not possess the qualities the Scottish players had. My players
did not have the commitment, the desire to get a result.
''I still feel that, technically, we are a better side than Scotland
but other things count when it comes to qualification for a major
tournament.''
Romantsev realises that his side must perform above themselves in
their two games against Greece if they are now to reach the finals.
He looks at Scotland's remaining matches and envies Brown a fixture
list in which the Scots seemingly have their hardest games behind them
and with a run of home fixtures which could take them to the finals.
''Scotland may have looked in trouble when they could only draw with
us at Hampden and then lost in Athens but this result has changed
everything,'' he said. ''The Scots won in Helsinki while Greece and
ourselves still have to travel to Finland.
''If home results are essential for the Scots to qualify then they
will win these games. The Greeks do not travel well.
''Indeed, I believe that Scotland -- not Russia -- are now favourites
to win the section.''
* BRYAN Gunn is on the brink of giving Scotland manager Craig Brown
another Euro boost. The Norwich keeper is battling back from a broken
ankle and should be in action again in two weeks.
That would give him the chance to make the squad for the match against
San Marino at the end of April.
Gunn said: ''I had my first full training session this week and could
be back playing in a couple of weeks. I feel fine and everything is
going well and there is the incentive of getting back into the Scotland
squad.''

THE fear that Scotland was about to become enmeshed in the ''bung''
scandals already causing turmoil in England, seemed to recede last night
when the Danish club, Viborg, dismissed claims that they had only been
paid #20,000 of the #180,000 transfer fee they were due from Dundee
United for goalkeeper Henrik Jorgensen last summer.
Never the less, at the request of United, the SFA, who at first had
not intended to take implied irregularities any further, will look into
one specific transaction from a London bank to Viborg.
The Tannadice club also issued a statement which insisted that they
had only passed on information supplied by journalists and would have no
more to say about the matter.
The suggestions that Viborg had received a fraction of the agreed
transfer fee were refuted by Viborg's financial director, Karl Jensen,
who told me: ''It is nonsense to say we got only #20,000. We got all of
the #180,000 and we were happy with the deal.''
Jensen, who also was team manager at the time (''I gave up in October
because of too many business commitments'') but remains a member of the
board, went on: ''I was involved in the transfer from beginning to end
and, in fact, the actual financial arrangements were concluded between
me and the Dundee United secretary, Miss Trivedi. I did not speak to Mr
Golac and there was no agent involved, although there was one originally
who arranged his trial period.
After that ''trial,'' on United's pre-season tour to Malaysia,
Jorgensen played in the opening league match against Hibs, when the team
lost 5-0, and, since then, has made only one appearance as a substitute.
When I contacted the Viborg club secretary at their ground he, too,
assured me that the Danish club ''had no problems'' with the transfer
and had received their money.
The allegations of impropriety were contained in a report which said
that United had asked the SFA to investigate the claim that #160,000 had
''disappeared.''
However, SFA chief executive Jim Farry denied that the association had
received a request to hold an inquiry at that point. ''We were presented
by fax with some sketchy information and accordingly asked the club to
provide us with details,'' he said. ''We have had another fax from the
club today which asks us to examine one particular transaction involving
a London bank and Viborg.
''We will be contacting the Danish FA to ask them to question the club
about the transaction and we will await their reply.''
However, it is certain that the Danish FA will receive the same
response as was offered from the club yesterday, in which case there
would be nothing left to investigate.
United's former manager, Golac, who left the club by mutual consent
early this month, was not available for comment at his house in Broughty
Ferry and was understood to be in Belgrade where he went last week.
The statement from United, issued through their public-relations
representatives, said that the club was concerned ''at attempts by
sections of the press to imply a link between certain transfer deals
involving the club and the departure of Ivan Golac.''
The statement went on to explain that United were approached by two
journalists last week and asked to comment on information supplied
referring to an overseas player's transfer.
United did not make any comment but, after a board meeting, decided to
refer the information to the SFA.
''It will be seen from our statement that there was no link between
the allegations and the departure of Mr Golac,'' concluded the Tannadice
statement.
Farry had clearly felt that there was nothing which merited
investigation in the first instance and, unless the Danish FA comes up
with an unexpected response, the allegations seem likely to be dropped.
Farry remains confident that Scotland can stay free of the sleaze that
has engulfed English football, where Arsenal manager George Graham was
sacked after allegedly accepting #385,000 as part of transfer deals
involving Pal Lyderson and John Jensen. He is to appeal against a charge
of misconduct by the FA.
Farry said: ''You can never be sure of anything in football but I
don't think there is any evidence to lead us to believe that there will
be similar happenings here as in England.
''The difference is that our clubs have no money. Directors here
cannot afford to abrogate their responsibilities and leave everything to
the poor old manager. They have to monitor the costs of everything, from
catering to transfers, to keep their house in order.''

SCOTTISH football finally has shown its disapproval over the position
of Jack McGinn, who remains an office bearer of the SFA while without a
club directorship, and Falkirk chairman George Fulston, with the full
backing of the Scottish League Management Committee, will stand against
the former Celtic director at the association's annual meeting on May
15.
The league body have acted because they are ''perplexed and
perturbed'' by a system which allows McGinn to be vice-president of the
SFA and heading for the presidency when he no longer has a seat in the
boardroom of any club.
Fulston, who also owns the Brockville club, had been considering a
request by the management committee that he should stand against McGinn
and yesterday afternoon his letter of intent arrived at the SFA's Park
Gardens office by recorded delivery.
McGinn now faces a struggle to hold on to his position which many
within the game feel he should have given up a long time ago as a matter
of principle.
He was elected in 1993 while still a director of Celtic, but when the
new regime, headed by Fergus McCann, took over last year he lost his
directorship along with chairman Kevin Kelly.
However, while the Scottish League could no longer accommodate Kelly
unless he held a directorship, the SFA would argue that their
regulations allow them to retain McGinn so long as Celtic are willing to
have him as their appointed representative.
They did so as a thankyou for his support towards the end of the
take-over battle for Celtic when the family dynasties were finally
dismantled, but his position as vice-president has been a source of
concern and annoyance ever since.
''I am a friend of Jack and I have nothing personal against him, but I
felt I should do as asked by the league management committee, who feel
rules are rules, and stand for election as vice-president,'' said
Fulston. ''I have the absolute and full backing of the committee.''
Apparently, the Scottish League have sought clarification of the SFA's
position regarding McGinn, but they have been unhappy with the response.
The league and football in general have never been convinced of the
legitimacy of McGinn's position and many have felt him an incongruous
sight on Scottish trips abroad.
It is also widely felt he either should have stood down after the
takeover battle at his club cost him his director's position or the SFA
should have told him to go.
It is my information that he may ask Celtic to give him some kind of
position which would strengthen his claim to the association's
vice-presidency, but even if they comply he will be opposed by Fulston,
who commands support and respect.
''If I am elected I will work for the good of Scottish football,'' he
said.
It is also certain he would not be in favour of so many people clad in
official SFA attire hopping on to an aircraft every time the
international side plays abroad.
They were out in force only this week when Scotland played a European
Championship qualifying tie in Moscow. McGinn, of course, was there, but
for how much longer? That is the question now.
Also standing for re-election at the meeting are president Bill
Dickie, and treasurer John McBeth.

SCOTTISH NFU president John Ross yesterday criticised the BBC for
ignoring the mass of representations made to them calling for a reversal
of the decision to axe the daily 10-minute farming news radio programme.
The BBC hierarchy in London and Glasgow had maintained a policy of
complete silence, he said.
In the House of Commons 41 MP's had signed an early-day motion calling
on the BBC to re-consider and the issue had also been taken up by the
Select Committee on Scottish Affairs.
''The BBC didn't consult the farming and rural community in Scotland
when they arbitrarily decided to cut our 10-minute programme. Now they
don't have the decency to respond to the massive number of pleas made on
behalf of those living in Scotland's countryside,'' he said.
''It's a sad day when the BBC's public service duty to the nation can
be tossed aside by a few powerful individuals in such an offhand way.''
The final edition of the programme will be broadcast today.

As predicted, ''Iron Mike'' will return to the ring and Don King will

''Don is the greatest promoter in the world,'' Tyson said, adding that
his long-time friends John Horne and Rory Holloway will continue to

He also said his fights will be on the US Cable television channel,
Showtime, and that he has an agreement with the MGM Grand casino-hotel

However, Tyson, 28, did not mention when he hopes to return to the

He concluded his statement by saying: ''May Allah bless you all. Thank

CRAIG Brown, as always, was the personification of decorum as he
looked back and forward yesterday. The Scottish team manager said it
would be extremely disapppointing and damaging if the good work achieved
through endeavour and organisation in the Luzhniki Stadium the other
night was undone by complacency when his players go to San Marino next
month. But one of his central defenders was more forthright.
''If we don't beat San Marino, then we should all be shot,'' said
Colin Hendry, who along with Alan McLaren and Colin Calderwood, formed
the rock on which Russia's intentions perished, and frankly, I tend to
agree with the Blackburn Rovers player.
Scotland had to avoid defeat by Russia in Moscow on Wednesday night to
remain in control of their own destiny so far as qualification for the
European Championship finals was concerned, and having achieved that
much through a goalless draw, the squad surely would not be so negligent
as to falter against a team who have lost all four of their qualifying
ties so far.
That match in the Serravalle Stadium on Wednesday, April 26, will be
the first of five which can propel the Scots into the championship
finals in England next summer.
Scotland's draw in Moscow helped repair the damage done by defeat
against Greece in Athens and increased their points tally to eight from
the first five matches although Finland, who beat San Marino 2-0 on
Wednesday, moved into second place in Group 8 on nine points, three
behind the Greeks. However, Brown feels his side could win all of their
remaining matches and believes a total of 23 points would ensure
qualification.
''Put it this way, I would be very surprised and disappointed if we
accumulated that number of points and found it wasn't enough to get
through,'' he said. ''From the beginning, I always knew we would have to
win our last five games and we've given ourselves a chance by taking a
draw in Russia.''
The Scots have already played what looked like being their toughest
matches when the draw was made last year -- Finland in Helsinki (2-0
Scotland), Russia home and away (1-1 and 0-0), Greece in Athens (1-0
Greece) -- although Greece at Hampden in August will be a crucial game.
''Still, it is in our own hands, although we will have to be careful
against the others, San Marino, the Faroe Islands, and Finland,'' Brown
said.
Greece's match against Russia next month also could have a vital
bearing on which two nations qualify from the section, and when asked
which result Brown would prefer from that one, he offered various
preferred possibilities, although basically what he was saying was that
a draw would do us no harm at all.
In the course of yesterday's conversation, Brown also spoke of
''freemasonry'' among goalkeepers and mentioned something about his
keepers sleeping together. The tabloid chaps became extremely animated
at this point before Brown corrected himself.
''I mean that keepers keep to themselves, that they stick together
like the Mafia and when I say they sleep together I mean, of course,
that they room together,'' he explained.
Could the pressure be getting to our Craig?
Darren Jackson and John McGinlay, who are not in the Mafia, and who
never sleep with goalkeepers, started against Russia, and Jackson
finished in partnership with Duncan Shearer. All three will be employed
in San Marino unless others prove their fitness and form.
''The players who have just gone back to their clubs did the country a
real turn in difficult circumstances and are entitled to believe they
will be asked back,'' the manager said.
Brown used a little psychology against the Russians by allowing the
first-timers, Jackson and Colin Calderwood, to have their caps prior to
the match and it worked. ''They were appreciative and emotional as they
looked at their caps and I told them there would be more if they could
go out and prove themselves,'' Brown said.
However, if the likes of Duncan Ferguson and Scott Booth are fit and
performing well Brown would be duty bound to bring them into his squad
and he will not forget Tommy Craig's under-21s either, although all but
one or two of them will have to wait a while yet for an opportunity at
the top level.
Rangers' Charlie Miller is in line for first promotion and if he
continues to progress, the midfield player, who helped the younger side
beat their Russian counterparts 2-1 by scoring the winning goal, will be
in the senior squad for the return match against San Marino at the end
of the year.
''Miller looks the most likely to make fastest progress from the
Under-21s and if he does come through he would help put pressure on the
regular midfield players in the squad who would have to perform to keep
their places,'' Brown said.
Perhaps Miller might even be worth promotion next month because he is
fresh and enthusiastic and capable of opening defences, and since San
Marino's will be well manned, the more ingenuity Brown can muster the
better. Also, A and B challenge matches have been scheduled in Sweden
for October, so why wait until the following month's game against San
Marino to give Miller his opportunity?
Brown spoke of other players in Miller's group, but he again expressed
his concern that the country's younger players are being abused
''physically and emotionally'' by having to play in too any games. ''For
instance, look at Miller, who has been suspended recently,'' Brown said.
''That break from the pressures of first-team football has probably been
good for him.''
There is not much Brown can do about that particular problem, but at
least the competitive element of the Scottish game makes the players
willing to run and tackle, and that is what they did against Russia.
Jackson and McGinlay, who was replaced late on by Shearer, refused to
allow their opponents to start building from the back, and in midfield,
Gary McAllister, John Collins, and Paul McStay, worked tenaciously with
the full-backs, Tommy Boyd and Stewart McKimmie supporting on either
side. The defensive line of Colin Hendry, Alan McLaren, and Calderwood
didn't have a failure.
However, it would have been good to have wintessed a little more
creativity from the Scottish players once they realised their
organisation and work-rate had knocked a lacklustre Russian side off
their rhythm. ''I would have liked that also,'' Brown said, ''but to
restrict Russia to only three clear chances in 90 minutes is not bad
going.
''However, I am aware that a win in Moscow might well have won us a
qualifying place, but the midfield players, who normally manage a few
chances on goal among them didn't do that the other night. I can assure
you, though, they will be creating chances and also threatening to score
against San Marino.
''If the players swan about in San Marino, we will have problems, but
they are professional and I don't expect that to happen.''

THE British Wool Marketing Board yesterday reaffirmed its opposition
to plans by Alexandria-based wool merchants J&amp;W Greig to buy wool direct
from Scottish farmers as agents for a foreign buyer.
Board chairman Alun Evans described Greig's proposal to export wool
direct to Eire for Brintons Portugal -- a subsidiary of an English
carpet manufacturer -- as an artificial device to by-pass the current
wool marketing scheme. ''In order to safeguard the centrally organised
wool-handling system for the benefit of all producers, there must be no
ambiguity or misunderstanding of the scheme,'' he said.
It was clear that in selling any wool for export there should be no
intention of circumventing the scheme by subsequently importing any of
the wool back into the UK in its greasy state.

<HEADLINE>Support for pig stalls Any move to ban farrowing crates called unacceptable</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>ROBERT ROSS,FARMING EDITOR</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>979124377</RECORDNO>

ANY move to ban the use of farrowing stalls for pigs in this country
would lead to a loss of 25% of piglets born -- a level which was
unacceptable in both welfare and commercial terms, it was claimed
yesterday.
''After the stall and tether ban these crates are the next target,''
warned Nick MacIvor of the specialist construction company A M Warkup,
as he showed visitors round a new pig production unit his company have
built for Oatridge Agricultural College at Ecclesmachan, West Lothian.
The farrowing crates, he explained, were designed so that the sow
could lower herself to the ground straight, rather than flopping down on
top of her piglets. ''If other systems are used you will lose a quarter
of the piglets you produce.''
The new #390,000 facility, which will house 130 breeding sows,
includes some of the latest technology available to the pig breeder. The
unit is designed so that if necessary it can be operated by one man.
It is based on a loose house system with the pregnant sows in groups
of 12, using dump feeders. They progress to a farrowing area, with
crates for the birth of piglets, where they remain for a four-week
lactation period.
The young pigs move through a finishing system which has proved to be
the most popular in the UK -- developed by the Scottish Agricultural
College. Sensors throughout the unit control temperatures with vents
opening and closing automatically according to pre-determined levels.
The weaner, rearer, and finisher houses are all slurry-based while the
earlier parts of the system use straw or shavings.
The buildings amounted to a machine geared to the production of
quality lean meat in conditions which were comfortable for the pigs,
said Mr MacIvor. ''Some of the highest growth rates we are achieving in
the industry are recorded in housing like this. We have taken account of
all possible legislation which we think the UK pig industry will be
subjected to and we believe the buildings have a useful life of 20-25
years.''
Britain, he said, was much more sophisticated than its European
competitors in finishing pigs. Superior use of building techniques and
materials in this country meant that Dutch or German pig farmers could
pay two or three times as much as their British counterpart for the same
building.
The new unit will operate as an educational base and as a commercial
unit generating income for the college. Mr Jeff Wilson, lecturer in
animal production and management at the college, said it intended to
provide a variety of courses tailored to the needs of the pig industry.
These will range from traditional block or day-release courses to
evening programmes.
A concentrated foundation course for new entrants is envisaged and
there will also be provision for an Oatridge College Certificate in pig
production which will incorporate Scotvec/Scottish Pig Industry
Initiative awards.
The first pigs to be introduced to the new unit will arrive on Monday
--  manor hybrids from the National Pig Development Company, and large
white boars.
The NPDC describes that combination as ''the flagship of modern
breeding stock anywhere in the world, producing a pig fulfilling the
requirements of modern consumer demand for healthier, leaner meat''.

<TEXT>
GOALKEEPER Michael Watt has been given a confidence boost by caretaker
manager Roy Aitken -- but at the same time put right in the firing line
as Aberdeen try to beat the drop.
Aitken is putting his faith in the former Scotland Under-21 player to
cope with the pressures of the Pittodrie club's relegation battle after
having turned down an offer from veteran John Burridge to return to the
Dons and deputise for injured Dutchman, Theo Snelders.
Watt now has to do the business in the remaining seven matches. They
will determine not only the club's premier division fate, but also could
win Watt a new contract deal.
Aitken insisted: ''I have no hesitation in relying on Watt. He has
done well for us in the past, and I'm certain he will do so again.
''He has been working closely with Snelders and learning all the time
from him. But make no mistake, he is his own man, and there is not a
problem with his confidence.''
''This is the most important game of the season because it is the next
one. In our situation, every game is vital.
''I know, though, that my players are up and ready for the
challenge.''
* DUNFERMLINE manager Bert Paton yesterday signed Falkirk striker Greg
Shaw for a fee in the region of #50,000, and he will go straight into
the team for their top-of-the-table clash with Dundee tomorrow,
replacing Hamish French, who is out for the season with a fractured
collar bone.
''I wanted to sign him when I was with St Johnstone,'' said Paton.
''But he left Ayr to go on trial with Liverpool, who valued him at
#200,000.
''With Neale Cooper having a knee injury, we have had to pull Andy Tod
back to the central defence and we have missed his height up front. Greg
will give us that height again.''
The 25-year-old Shaw said: ''Circumstances changed for me when the
Falkirk manager signed Mo Johnston, Steve Kirk, and Paul McGrillen while
I was injured.
''Dunfermline is a big club which attracts a big support and I expect
to kick-start my career here.''
* BERWICK have beaten the transfer deadline to sign two defenders --
right back Lee McAulay, who was with Brighton for three seasons, and
18-year-old left back Charlie Goldwire, a Celtic youth player.
* ARBROATH have signed former Clydebank defender John Crawford, who
had returned to the Juniors with Arthurlie, and last night manager John
Brogan was in signing talks with his former club, Stirling Albion, in
the hope of capturing two more players.
* NEIL Orr, who has been unable to hold a regular first team place
with St Mirren this season, was last night in transfer talks with Queen
of the South.
Queens were also talking with midfielder Paul Ronald, of Clyde, and
setting up a swap deal with Stranraer which would lead to them signing
Steve Cody with Doug McGuire going to the first division club.
* PARTICK Thistle are poised to sign former Burnley striker Roger Eli
before tonight's transfer deadline.
The 28-year-old hitman scored Thistle's goal in the 1-1 draw with
Celtic reserves at Firhill yesterday.
Now Jags boss John Lambie wants to snap him up on a contract until the
end of the season. He could make a surprise debut in tomorrow's home
clash with Hibs.
Eli was freed by Burnley after injuring a knee. He has spent the last
year playing in Chinese football.
* STRATHCLYDE Regional Council is to give #300,000 towards the
redevelopment of Hampden Park as Scotland's national football stadium.
The money goes to the National Stadium Committee.

BOXING and snooker mogul Barry Hearn yesterday formally completed his
purchase of impoverished second division club Leyton Orient, predicting
that by July 1 they would be ''at worst, breaking even.''
Hearn admitted that Orient -- currently under the threat of relegation
-- probably would never become a Premiership club, but added: ''I will
be disappointed if they are not in the first division by the year
2000.''
The club will be shortly launching what they claim will be the biggest
publicity campaign in the history of football to give Leyton Orient a
new image. ''I like a challenge and I could not have got a bigger one,''
added Hearn. ''I'm quite excited. I used to go and watch them when I was
10 years old.
''Everyone in London will tell you Leyton Orient is their second
favourite club or the club they used to go to when they were young. We
need to get them to come back and give their support.''
Tony Wood, who has stood down as chairman, remains on the board with
his fellow directors.
Hearn said he would not be offering the present managerial duo of John
Sutton and Chris Turner a vote of confidence in view of its connotation
with getting the sack.

HAVING read Julie Davidson's nostalgic article on railways, both
domestic and world-wide, I find myself entirely sympathetic with her
yearnings (March 24).
While I cannot match any of her eloquently descriptive long-distance
journeys, I do recall a memorable journey by steam locomotive from
Colombo in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) up country to Bandarawella, a
hill-town surrounded by tea plantations, passing through Kandy, in 1945.
Prior to war service I had been a railway clerk and returned to that
occupation following demob. Railways were in my blood, my older brother,
father, and grandfather having been railwaymen, and while I left the
railway for more remunerative employment in 1953 there is still a
nostalgic part of me that reflects my railway heritage.
Although I have no ojbections to the privatisation of public transport
in principle, it will be a great pity if any of our more scenic railway
routes are sacrificed in the process.

EVERY year about now, that posse of well-meaning souls will meander
around the countryside listening for the first cuckoo, then hurry off
their letters to The Times and glow in the belief they are first to have
spotted the advent of Spring. Apart from the fact that the poor bird is
usually sheltering from the hail, the exercise is totally unnecessary.
The change of season is far simpler to detect. When the first golfer
steps on the first tee at Augusta National next Thursday to signal the
start of the US Masters, Spring, my friends, will have well and truly
sprung. The warmth of major golf, which brings with it the first parade
of the great swinging gladiators, is an infallible portent of sport, at
least, entering the sunnier season.
The Masters is not without its critics, and justifiably so. It is the
only tournament which has managed to give itself a sense of arrogant
importance which reeks of a pathetic attempt to recreate the
exclusivity, the inimitable snobbishness of places like our own
Muirfield, where such aloofness and preening discrimination have been
nurtured and cultivated over centuries, rather than a miniscule 60
years.
Unlike all of the other majors, The Masters is by invitation only and,
over the years, regularly has left out non-American competitors whose
right to a place has been solid.
For that reason, it can never be termed a world championship in the
way that the others, particularly The Open, can lay claim to that title,
but it has been able to establish a huge reputation as one of the
tournaments which every top professional wants to win. It is also played
on a course which leaves all hackers and handicappers gasping in
admiration.
When the Augusta azaleas bloom, we are ready to haul out the bag,
endure the creaking of awakening back muscles, and hurl ourselves
towards the greater glory.
In the meantime, let us -- in the interests of science and winning a
few bob at the bookies -- examine the first major closely to see if we
can unearth any significant indications of who might do well when the
great show begins next Thursday.
First of all, it is quite clear from the litany of winners, that few
ordinary chaps have the game, the determination, and the nerve to play
championship golf through four rounds on one of the most beautiful but
demanding courses in the world.
Perhaps Larry Mize would count as one minor exception to the rule of
the last decade or so. The man from Augusta has a special affection for
the famous course of his birthplace and invariably plays well there,
even if his victory in 1987 was courtesy of a 140-ft chip shot into the
cup at the second extra hole of the play-off against Greg Norman.
Otherwise, the green jacket winners in the last decade include most of
the biggest names of the modern era, like Nick Faldo (1989 and '90),
Bernhard Langer ('85 and '93), Jose Maria Olazabal ('94), Fred Couples
('92), Ian Woosnam ('91), Sandy Lyle ('88) and, inevitably, the man who
straddled three decades, Jack Nicklaus ('63,'65, '66,'72,'75 and '86).
Six of the last seven winners have been Europeans, conclusive proof
that not only have they caught up with their American counterparts, but
that this course suits them.
It is also the case that some players, like Mize, are inclined to
reserve some of their best golf of the season for this Spring outing.
Olazabal, for example, has been in the top 10 in two of the last three
years, is in decent form again and might well go close to winning for
the second year running.
Old-timer Ray Floyd rarely fails to excel at Augusta and, while
winning at 52 seems unlikely, the fact that he has been in the top 10
three times in the last five years suggests he could suprise some of the
younger brigade.
Arguably the man with best recent record is one who has never won a
major, Lanny Wadkins, but he is now concentrating more on his Ryder Cup
captain's role than tournament play, even if he has finished third three
times in the last five years.
Maybe the best each way bet of all is 36-year-old Tom Lehman, who has
made a commendable return to the US Tour since 1992 after having
abandoned it in 1985. He finished second in The Masters last year,
following his third the previous year.
Lehman also finished well up the field in the Players Championship at
Ponte Verde last week.
Others who showed themselves in good form there and like Augusta, are
Langer, runner-up last week, and Corey Pavin, who has had two top 10
finishes in the last three years at Augusta, while Payne Stewart showed
an encouraging return to form.
Pavin might be my each way hope but it is also hard to resist a
flutter on South African Ernie Els, who finished eighth in his first try
last year.

IN the Letters of Malachi Malagrowther, Sir Walter Scott opposed the
Government's proposed assimilation of the Scottish banking system to the
English model, advancing the objection that conditions appropriate to
England would be unlikely to suit Scotland if Scotland were not
previously rendered as flat as England.
The absurdity of the proposal thus demonstrated, the Government took
the only sensible option, and withdrew.
Today, however, the Scottish banks themselves intend (March 27) to
impose English conditions of service by compelling their unwilling staff
to take foreign holidays, at the same time as they are to be denied the
traditional New Year (Sobering) Day on January 2.
Perhaps these unfortunate hirelings have also been instructed to cease
sustaining themselves with oats, the better to feed their horses.
I hope not, but fear so.

EDINBURGH Monarchs have an old score to settle when they open their
season against Glasgow Tigers at Powderhall tonight. The sides have met
175 times since the original fixture in 1948, and Tigers hold the
balance 87-83 with three drawn.
However, the opening leg of the Spring Trophy challenge should give
Monarchs the opportunity to peg one back on their great rivals.
Edinburgh's line-up is complete, although former Danish under-21 cap
Robert Larsen, signed on Tuesday, will not arrive until Easter.
The former Powderhall rider Frede Schott should prove an able guest,
joining last year's regulars Les Collins, Kenny McKinna, Jan Andersen,
Scott Lamb, and Lawrence Hare and pre-season buy Mike Faria, of America,
in a solid squad.
Tigers, meanwhile, are a rider short of full strength, and their
latest signing, Charlie Ermolenko, cannot be expected to be a heavy
scorer on a track where he was twice a faller on his only visit in 1992.
Last year, Glasgow won the corresponding meeting 49-47.
* FORMER England skipper Kelvin Tatum has been handed a shock chance
to win a third British championship -- even though he has turned his
back on Premier League racing this season.
Tatum, who has retired from British racing to spend more time on the
Continent, has been included in the semi-final draw for the British
Championship and needs to finish in the top six to qualify for his tenth
British final.
England's four grand prix contenders -- Gary Havelock (Bradford), Mark
Loram (Exeter), Chris Louis (Ipswich), and Andy Smith (Coventry) -- have
all been seeded direct to the British final at Coventry on Sunday, April
30.
Therefore, they do not need to race in either of the semis -- at
Middlesbrough on April 13 and at Eastbourne on April 16.

DRIVING south on the A80 road in cold weather I overtook a Strathclyde
region vehicle engaged in gritting. Large lumps of hard material were
being hurled with great force across the outside lane, many striking my
car. Subsequent examination has revealed a number of new chips in the
paintwork.
Is it absolutely necessary to damage passing cars in the course of
gritting work? One cannot help feel either that the apparatus employed
is basically unsatisfactory or is used at excessive speed.
Perhaps someone with appropriate knowledge will explain the recognised
method of operation and the extent to which the interests of
simultaneous road-users are taken into account.

PHIL Miller's letter ended where it should have begun -- on a
discussion of reality and fantasy (March 27). I'm one of those ''I came
back'' Glaswegians -- came back because I saw hope reborn -- Glasgow
wasn't, after all, going down the tubes.
The vision and the reality came together in the Garden Festival.
Glasgow City Fathers saw a vision and made it happen. Hopefully that
sight has not been dimmed and the High Heid Yin who will speak for us in
the Year of Architecture, 1999, can show the world that we still have
imagination and vision and spirit. Or, on the other hand he can show a
nice new office block that would be at home in any town.
Glasgow is either special and different and unique -- or it's a place
to build the ordinary and the commonplace. The choice is ours. Let's not
look back in boredom from 1999 and see what a great chance we missed.

THE world's top two players, Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, will
forget their rivalry today as they team up for the United States against
Italy in the Davis Cup.
The world group quarter-final tie in Palermo marks the first time a
top pair appear in the same squad since John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors
in 1984.
It may seem like overkill against the unfancied Italians, but
Wimbledon champion Sampras was in the team that lost to Sweden in the
semi-finals last year, and the defeat still rankles.
Agassi, the US and Australian Open champion, is playing his first
Davis Cup game since a qualifying round tie in 1993. But he was in both
the 1990 and 1992 winning teams and has won an impressive 20 out of 24
Davis Cup singles.
German rivals Boris Becker and Michael Stich are joining forces again
for their tie against Holland in Utrecht.
Sweden are bristling with confidence for their tie against Austria and
their team of former world No.1, Stefan Edberg, Magnus Larsson, Jonas
Bjorkman and Jan Apell should have little trouble against Thomas Muster,
Alexander Antonitsch and Herbert Wiltschnig.
* JONATHAN Tankhurst's winning run in the men's singles at the Reebok
British tour event at the Wirral Tennis Centre came to an end in
yesterday's final qualifying round. The 15-year-old from Kingussie beat
Andrew Hill 7-6, 4-6, 7-5, Matthew Terland 6-4, 6-1, Gavin Arbor 7-6,
6-4, and Mark Ellis 6-1, 7-6 before going down 7-6, 6-1 to Steven Amey.
Scottish interest in the women's singles ended in yesterday's first
round round of the tableau finale when qualifier Nicola Payne lost 6-4,
6-2 to Louise Latimer and Nicola Burns was beaten 6-2, 6-3 by Candy

total return than that on the new FTSE Fledgling index, through
investment in companies with a market capitalisation of less than #50m.
Business development director Gordon Neilly believes the smaller
companies sector is more attractively valued in terms of yield and
price-earnings ratios than the larger end.
Ivory &amp; Sime is quite positive on the outlook for the London market,
with increased investor confidence beginning to show through in volumes.
Meanwhile, Edinburgh Fund Managers is seeking to triple the size of
its Edinburgh Japan Trust to take advantage of the corporate
earnings-driven upturn it is predicting in the country's recently
troubled stock market.
The #14.5m fund announced a #20m placing and #10m open offer of
conversion shares, sponsored by London stockbroker James Capel.
Iain Watt, managing director of Edinburgh Fund Managers, said: ''The
trust's launch in 1992 corresponded with a low point in the Japanese
market and the good performance since then has vindicated our timing.
''We believe a similar opportunity will present itself over the next
few months.''
Returning to the Ivory &amp; Sime launch, sponsor Peel Hunt, a
London-based smaller companies specialist broker, has already obtained
irrevocable commitments from institutional and other investors to
subscribe for five million #5 units. Each unit consists of five Ordinary
shares and one warrant.
A further 1.75 million units were yesterday made available through an
intermediaries offer, although Ivory &amp; Sime is not relying on uptake of
this.
Dealings in the units are expected to start on April 27, with trading
in the individual shares and warrants due to begin on May 18.

BABS Dawson, at the peak of her career, spent 10 years at
all-conquering Western Klick Photopoint. During that time she helped
them win six Scottish League titles and two silver medals in the
European Club championship, but she never has played in a Scottish Cup
final.
The former Scotland B international could resolve that situation
before she announces her retirement at the end of the season, as her
latest club, Eglinton, take on Bonagrass Grove in the first semi-final
of the Cup on Sunday at Cramond (1.45pm).
Dawson sees Susan Fraser's penalty corner shots as a major problem but
she will take some comfort from the fact that she has a number of
experienced colleagues in the side including 48-year-old goalkeeper
Chris Wise.
The Dundonians have another important engagement tomorrow at
Millerston (12.30) as they come up against the mighty Western, who
despite a poor season by their own high standards, are still in
contention for their fourteenth successive title. Western moved three
points clear at the top of the league after having beaten Boroughmuir
6-0.
* THE time of reckoning is fast approaching for the Aberdeen side
Touche Ross Gordonians in their plight to survive in the first division
of the Torrie Stockbrokers national men's hockey league. With five games
still to play, they are six points adrift of the pack.
Mathematically their situation is not yet hopeless particularly as
Watsonians, Insights Inverleith, Edinburgh University and Torbrex
Wanderers are among their opponents. But it's their match tomorrow which
will give the best insight as to their prospects of escaping to safety
as they take on MIM.
The Edinburgh side are well in contention for the championship.
Most interest in the second division will be focused on Maryfield
Dundee where Clydesdale will be hoping to clinch the title against
Morgan.

THE #98m Murray Ventures, which specialises in unlisted companies, has
turned up trumps with a market-beating performance in its latest six
months to the end of January.
Net asset value rose by 6.8% to 397.4p a share, and the total return,
after taking account of earnings, was 8.4% compared with a fall of 2.5%
in the total return on the All-Share Index.
The stock market responded favourably to the figures, and the shares
in the investment trust gained 9p to 347p.
Murray Johnstone, which manages the fund, said the performance was
creditable, especially as an unprecedented #53.8m had been invested in
new unlisted companies in the last 18 months.
''The effect of this is to constrain the growth of net assets in the
short term, because these new investments are normally held at cost for
one year,'' said Geoff Burns, the manager.
''It can be seen, therefore, that the remainder of the portfolio
performed quite strongly to achieve this outperformance.''
Unlisteds now account for 62% of net assets. Mr Burns is optimistic
that the record level of new investment will pay dividends.
Mergers and acquisitions have been flat, and management buy-out teams
have faced less competition from trade buyers.
''The price paid for the businesses is generally reasonable, and only
moderate gearing is required to make a good return.''
Mr Burns said that Murray Ventures had acquired a substantial new
portfolio at reasonable values.
''If mergers and acquisitions activity increases as forecast, then
these businesses will become acquisition targets in an environment where
price levels will have risen within the next few years.''
Included in major new additions to the portfolio is Mining (Scotland),
the management and employee privatisation of British Coal in Scotland,
listed as Murray Ventures' sixth-largest investment, worth #2.4m.
The interim dividend is being increased from 3.5p to 3.6p.

THE former Garden Festival site in Glasgow was sold to Laings
(Property Developers) and bought back from them twice, amid much public
controversy. It directly created 1500 jobs during its six-month
operation and it more than exceeded all its revenue targets, being
supported by four million visitors, except for commercial sponsorship.
It created a walkway along the south bank of the Clyde and a permanent
pedestrian link at Bell's Bridge to replace the Govan Ferry. It
transformed an ugly derelict landscape into a high quality tourism
attraction of international standing.
It was promised that a permanent tourism facility would be developed,
thereby realising the full potential of this strategic location. Until
that time an area was to be made available for the recreational use of
local residents. However, the site has been left derelict and was
recently fenced off and renamed Pacific Quay
Careful examination of this GDA/Millers' plan reveals 2000 parking
spaces and ''high car-parking ratios of one space per person,'' so one
not unreasonably assumes that these ''new'' employees will be coming
some distance and are thus not local.
Across this desert of tarmac lies a veritable wall of cuboid buildings
lining the riverside and blocking the excellent views to the north.
Local residents will be required to traverse this 20-acre black field to
get to the cinema in the dark and during all weathers.
People from local communities and across the west of Scotland are not
easily fooled by the GDA/Millers' proposal and weak attempts at
propaganda (March 24).
The Science Centre is far better sited in Geoffrey Jarvis's proposal
and the gardens can readily operate all year round as is the case with
most local garden centres and golf courses.
The Clyde Festival Gardens and the Maritime Heritage Centre will
readily become a major tourist attraction and may well, due to public
support, be eligible for a large award of up to #50m from the Millennium
Commission.
If local development agencies and the new council agree to support, it
could even be a venue for the Millennium Festival itself.

MOST of the health service professional staff organisations entered
into agreements with the Government in which the Government agreed to
accept the recommendations of the independent pay review bodies while we
in the professions agreed to eschew industrial action.
In the 1990s the Government reneged on these agreements several times
by accepting the pay review bodies' recommendations only partially by
the device of phasing the awards -- a recommended 7% rise would be paid
as 3% from April through December and the balance of 4% added on from
January through March.
Anyone who can do simple sums realises that this is an acceptance of
the recommendation in some strange sort of name only, the figure paid
out amounting to, in real terms, 4%.
This clever ploy was repeated several times, although it was
noticeable that in April, 1992, before the election, they were more
open-handed.
Since the Government has been reneging for several years, the worst
and most dishonourable way being this year, it is interesting to see Mrs
Bottomley self-righteously criticising the professional staff
organisations when they in their turn, and quite legally since the
agreements are already broken, reclaim the right of industrial action.
The public service professions have behaved and are behaving with
honour and integrity in the face of persistent breaches of trust from
the Government, and have finally had to accept the convoluted message
from Government that the agreements are and have been meaningless.

I FIND the utterances of Michael Portillo especially offensive. He
cannot be blamed, I suppose, for not elaborating on his party's
policies, since if he did so he would probably scupper its chances on
the spot.
But his statement that the Tories should stop squabbling among
themselves, concentrate on the election, and attack the opposition which
he referred to as ''the enemy'', makes one wonder what this country has
come to.
All parties, ostensibly at least, share a commitment to govern the
country purposefully, however at variance their individual methods may
be. That one party can talk of another as ''the enemy'' is deplorable.
If I were trying to promote a party I'd talk more about what that
party could achieve. That neither Michael Portillo nor any other Cabinet
Minister does so seems to carry a message. But that they concentrate on
trying to discredit the Labour Party or the Liberal Democrats makes
them, in my opinion, totally unworthy of respect.

LIGHTWEIGHT golf professional David Creamer, a former English table
tennis No.2, scored a six-under-par 66 to lead the first round of the
Windsor Senior Masters in Nairobi, Kenya, yesterday.
Creamer, 52, and just nine and a half stone, has resigned his job as
the head professional at a club in Germany to play full-time on the PGA
European Seniors Tour. His six-under-par round in the season's opening
event, comprised six birdies and 12 pars.
Creamer leads by two strokes from former Ryder Cup players Malcolm
Gregson, Brian Waites, and Spain's Antonio Garrido, and by four from a
group which includes tournament favourites Brian Huggett and John
Morgan, the 1994 European Seniors No.1.
Scotland's Gordon Gray, from Dumfries and County, is well placed in
joint tenth place after a 71, while former Ryder Cup player George Will,
now living in Kent after a long spell in Belgium, lies joint
twenty-third in a field of 44 following his first-round 73. Leading
first-round scores:
66 -- David Creamer (England).
68 -- Malcolm Gregson (England), Antonio Garrido (Spain); Brian Waites
(England).
70 -- John Morgan (England), Brian Huggett (Wales), Liam Higgins
(Ireland), Alberto Croce (Italy), David Jimenez (USA).
71 -- Gordon Gray (Scotland), Frank Hill (England), Tommy Horton
(England), Rafe Botts (USA).

THERE were two good results for Scottish skiers in the giant slalom at
the British Land British National Ski Championships in Tignes France
yesterday, but disappointment for top-ranked Scots girls Emma Carrick
Anderson, Sandra Wilson, and Lesley McKenna, who all skied off course at
virtually the same point.
The problem for the Scots trio was once more a poorly prepared track
which trapped them skiing a faster line than their earlier running
rivals, which found them catching edges in the new soft snow.
The women's race was won by 15-year-old Sophie Ormond, brother of
British Europa Cup team skier James who yesterday took third place in
the men's event.
Sophie, ranked tenth in the world for her age group won the French
Championships last year.
Kirsteen McGibbon (Glasgow) of the KPMG Scottish Alpine Team took an
excellent third place, losing out on the runners-up spot by half a
second.
McGibbon, who won a FIS Giant Slalom race in Pra Loup earler this
season, is now looking forward to the speed disciplines.
Alain Baxter of Aviemore retained his men's giant slalom title,
beating Martin Bell on the first run by 66 hundredths of a second to
give himself a final margin of 0.25 of a second.
The Men's Europa Cup team member, who is also defending his men's
combined title believes he can hold off Bell's challenge.Giant slalom
results:
Men -- 1, Alain Baxter (Aviemore/Hanson &amp; Robertson British Men's FIS

AMEC is just the latest UK construction company to see no light on the
horizon for UK construction with chairman Sir Alan Cockshaw prophesying
the industry will continue to be difficult for the foreseeable future.
He added that there were too many competitors. However,
rationalisation will be a process of attrition as has been the case in
steel stockholding even although he has had talks with other major
companies to see what can be done.
The problem is that none are prepared to give ground even through
giving up activities where they are perhaps weaker than their peers.
So it is as well that in the last three years Amec has been building
up its overseas activities, particularly in the Far East and South-east
Asia, although the first real benefits will not be seen until 1996. Even
so, they should account for 35% of 1995 turnover.
Overall turnover fell 10% last year to #1962m, partly reflecting the
policy of moving away from low-margin work, particularly in the UK.
Pre-tax profits last year eased marginally by #400,000 to #20m,
concealing an underlying profit improvement of 20%. That reflects the
sale of low-performing non-core activities and a strong performance by
the various associate companies -- Amec's wholly-owned subsidiares fell
back 35% to #19.4m of the #28.6m operating profits.
To be fair, that did include a #3.2m loss on the sale of the Trafalgar
Place, Brighton, development and an undisclosed write-down on the value
of the Tiffany, North Sea platform. Talks continue with Agip and there
are hopes of some eventual cost recoveries.
UK housing made a tiny profit as Amec continues to work its way off
over-bought land. It sold 1623 houses at an average price of #72,500 as
well as 354 social units and expects a similar build in 1995 with prices
raised to #79,000 on a higher quality mix.
While the amount of over-priced plots remains high, some 20%, housing
profits should move towards #10m -- but there seems no special reason
why Amec should remain in this sector and the assets better employed
elsewhere.
The North Sea saw a fall in hook-up activity but maintenance is
improving with there now being a subsidiary in the Norwegian sector to
pick up a few crumbs there.
Germany is moving toward 20% of group activity, particularly in the
east with Amec able to exploit its building and civil engineering
skills.
Profits this year could recover partially to #28m. Debt is not a
problem with gearing at just 17% and so Sir Alan is aiming to push a
progressive dividend policy. The 1994 total has been maintained at 3p
for a 5.3% yield with the shares 9p better at 71p -- they seem high
enough.

I NOTE that the 60-day prison sentence imposed on Victoria Leiper by
Sheriff Smith at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court earlier this year has been
upheld on appeal, ie, that the highest court in the land has ruled that
it was an appropriate sentence for the serious crime she had committed
(March 23).
Given the ''controversy'' the sentence caused when it was passed --
attracting front-page criticisms of the sheriff -- surely it would have
been appropriate for you to have featured his vindication as

THE vast majority of adults in Britain are well and truly hooked on
the National Lottery, but there is immense dissatisfaction at how the
prize money is divided.
To pay one winner the mammoth sum of #8m or #9m or, as happened right
at the beginning, over #14m, does not go down well with a large
percentage of the population.
Most people would be happy with a jackpot of #2m and the balance of
the kitty distributed down through the lesser prize winners. There could
of course be four or five #2m winners in one week.
Another controversial point is that unlike the pools firms, Camelot,
the lottery organisers, do not publish weekly prize lists.
Everyone knows that at present you receive #10 for three correct
numbers, but very few people could tell you how much you receive for
five numbers only, for example. I think the millions of people who buy
tickets are entitled to have this information on a weekly basis.
However, I look forward to the day when the prize for three correct
does not necessarily have to be fixed at #10, but could be a good bit
higher.

THE French Rugby Federation has still to act over claims by a former
Scotland under-21 internationalist that he is paid #800 a month to play
for the French first division side Mandelieu.
The FFR was to have conducted an investigation into the assertion by
Kevin Campbell that he received a monthly pay cheque. The former Hawick
flanker also maintains that payment to players is rife throughout the
French game and that his case is not out of the ordinary.
The Campbell case was reported to the International Rugby Football
Board six weeks ago by the Scottish Rugby Union and an immediate inquiry
was expected to get underway.
Yesterday, Campbell told The Herald that he had not been contacted by
the FFR and that, in his opinion, this indicated how seriously they
viewed the affair.
Campbell, who has played in France since 1986, faces a life ban if it
is proved that he has been paid for playing as direct pay-for-play
payments are in contravention of IB amateurism regulations.

New Orleans
TWO weeks ago at Bay Hill, Sandy Lyle missed the cut by a stroke, at
the Players' Championship last week, he was off course by six strokes.
But here yesterday the Scot shot his first round in the 60's in the USA
this year, a three-under-par 69, that put him three strokes off the pace
set by Kirk Triplett in the first round of the New Orleans Classic.
''I'm quite pleased for a change,'' said Lyle. ''I had lots of chances
today and putts that went around the hole, but it was good. I should
have been five under instead of three.''
The main reason for the elevation of his score by at least two strokes
was a mishap on the par-five second.
His drive was in the middle of the fairway, but when he went for the
green, his second shot landed 30 yards short and in a bush, where it was
lost, resulting in a bogey six.
Otherwise Lyle felt that his round went well, a combination of
comparatively easy scoring conditions following the seven inches of rain
that had fallen on the course over the previous two days, and the
steadily growing improvement of his game.
Lyle's comments however, remained cautiously optimistic. ''I played
well. It's encouraging. But I'm not counting my chickens. I'll just go
out tomorrow and try to build on that.''
Rain made the course play easy, and more than half the field was at
par or better. Both Ian Woosnam and David Feherty shot respectable
rounds of two-under-par 70, while Jesper Parnevik carded a one-under 71.
Those were the European success stories, especially as all played in the
afternoon when conditions were none too clever.
The man who will defend at the Masters next week, Spain's Jose Maria
Olazabal, did not have the consistent round that he was looking for. He
had four bogeys and three birdies in a disappointing round of 73.
The lead after the first round was seven under par, held by Brad
Bryant, an 18-year journeyman who will be making his first appearance at
Augusta next week. Scores (USA unless stated);
65 -- B Bryant.
66 -- K Triplett.
67 -- B Mayfair, D Duval.
68 -- M Reid, D Tewell, B Claar, G Waite (N Zealand), S Simpson, W

AYRSHIRE Metal Products yesterday heralded the benefits of
redundancies during the last three years, with a 62% increase in 1994
pre-tax profits to #2.18m.
The Irvine-based steel processor and stockholder more than tripled its
total payout to 4.75p, after a final dividend of 3.5p. Its shares put on
3p to 136p, against the backdrop of a surging stock market.
Turnover was up 13% at #37.0m in the year to end-December and managing
director Colin Macnab attributed the increase in profits to the
reduction of the workforce in recent years from more than 400 to 295.
Chairman Mark Wilson said trading in the current financial year was
ahead of the comparable period last year, with some signs of overall
improvement in the group's principal markets.
However, although sales of cold rolled steel profiles are benefiting
from recovery in the truck and general engineering sectors, Mr Macnab
believes the construction industry remains fragile because of fears of
further interest rate rises.
Ayrshire Metal Products, which has a factory in Irvine, another at St
Helens near Liverpool, and a further two in the West Midlands, is now in
a net cash position. Reduced interest payments helped profits.
The company believes its move into steel stockholding operations,
which are also based in the West Midlands, has reduced the cyclical
nature of its business.
Ayrshire Metal Products' stockholding division can take advantage of
shortages of slit coil in the general marketplace, if there is a decline
in  demand from group companies for what it buys from steel
manufacturers.

DAWSON International is selling the loss-making Dawson Home Fashions
subsidiary in the US through to Springs Industries. The price was not
disclosed.
It is expected there will be a net loss of not more than $15m (#9.4m),
which will be included in the current financial year's results ending
tomorrow as an exceptional charge.
The shower curtain maker has net assets of $50m and will fit in neatly
with Springs' other home textiles operations.
Completion is expected by May 30.
Newly appointed chairman Derek Finlay, who replaced Sir Ronald Miller
in a shareholder-inspired boardroom coup on Monday evening, yesterday
said: ''This is a most satisfactory development for Dawson International
in line with our strategy announced earlier this week to divest
ourselves of this loss-making activity.''
Dawson shares rose 7p to 113p as the market began to sense that the
first steps toward returning to adequate profitability are being taken.
The City was stunned on Tuesday when the high-quality knitwear company
announced the boardroom changes which included the departure of managing
director Nick Kuenssberg and the loss of 500 jobs at a cost of #10m.

ANVAR Khan may have tripped up on more than her six-inch stilettos
(March 27). I found her remarks ''The neds were out. Boys with nae jobs,
nae money, and nae class'' particularly offensive.
It is unfortunately true that too many of our young people have no
jobs and no money, but to class them as ''neds'' for a cheap laugh is
sickening.
I suspect it is thoughtlessness rather than callousness which has
given rise to these comments but can a Feature Writer of the Year afford
to be so thoughtless? We are talking about people and their lives here,
not double-glazing.

GERMAN motor group BMW, which bought Rover from BAe in March last
year, yesterday lavished praise on the Rover business, saying it was a
great success and set to achieve ''more of its potential''.
BMW executives were commenting on the UK-based car-maker's performance
as they reported that BMW group sales rose in the first quarter of 1995.
Rover made an operating profit last year of about #18m under BMW's more
conservative accounting. BMW has already said Rover made a net profit of
#5m in the year.
Finance chief Volker Doppelfield commented: ''We have had great
success with Rover. We had not expected it to make a profit under our
accounting rules so it has done better than expected.''
He added: ''Rover still needs to be fully integrated into BMW but we
have laid a good basis. Their return on sales will rise. They can
achieve more of their potential in future.''
BMW itself expects a satisfactory result for the ful year but warns
that its earnings could be negatively affected by the weak dollar.

STANDARD Life yesterday launched a scathing attack on its competitors,
claiming their failure to reduce payouts on with-profit pensions in line
with investment returns would further damage the insurance industry's
reputation.
The Edinburgh-based giant, whose outburst could be interpreted by some
as an attempt to score points in a fiercely competitive marketplace,
justified its comments on the grounds of the common good.
Group managing director Scott Bell said: ''Companies which overpay in
this way to attract new business do their policyholders a disservice and
damage the reputation of the insurance industry.''
General manager of marketing John Hylands claimed, although there was
more discretion and smoothing in the with-profit than investment-linked
field, competitors' payouts had been considerably exceeding investment
returns for some time.
He said: ''This is alright for a while but, after a while, you begin
to feel it is not sustainable.
''It is getting to the point where the size and the speed of the
reductions that are likely to take place in the future could have quite
a negative impact on consumers generally.''
Mr Hylands believed the consequent disappointment of customers, whose
expectations about the performance of with-profit pensions had been
unduly raised, could hit the industry as a whole.
Standard Life, which has slightly reduced its terminal bonus rates on
with-profit policies because equity markets were generally subdued last
year, believes competitors will have to reduce bonuses sharply as more
policies begin to mature. Otherwise, it claims, their financial strength
will be impaired.
The mutual life giant claims that with-profit returns offered by some
competitors exceed their pension managed fund performance by as much as
40% over a 10-year period.
However, Standard Life admits its own payouts, which depend on its
profits and decisions on distribution of these, do not appear so
generous in relation to rivals.
Standard Life put reduced sales of pensions and other financial
products in 1994 primarily down to continuing adverse comment arising
from the Securities and Investments Board investigation into the
mis-selling of pensions.
Although every life company is having to go through a protracted
period of investigation and research, Mr Hylands said Standard Life did
not believe its directly-sold business would give rise to any
significant degree of problem.
In the year to November 15 last year, Standard Life's total new
premiums fell slightly to #2600m, although assets under management rose
4% to #38bn.

LIKE Ruth Wishart, though she looks much younger than I am, I have
attended evening classes at Glasgow University for a number of years
(March 20).
Like her, though she expresses her indignation more eloquently than I
ever could, I am appalled at the possibility that my attempts to improve
what I am pleased to call my mind might have to be ''credit-bearing''.
It's not just the jargon, it's the assault on the underlying
philosophy of Scottish education. Our universities are students'
universities, and must remain open at this level to anyone in the
community who wishes to study and to pay a reasonable fee for the
pleasure and privilege.
The teachers are, by and large, devoted and the pupils variously
delightful.
I am sorry to have missed Ruth Wishart at Conversational Italian. As
she would say, no doubt with better accent than mine: ''Avanti I
Popoli''. Ian Lang would love to hear from you.

I WAS working late in my Westminster office on Tuesday when a call
came in from the Press Association. They were following up the story
about Jonathan Aitken's directorship of a company which had traded
illegally in arms with Iran.
A quiet day suddenly turned into a busy night and I have spent many of
the intervening hours commenting and asking questions on what Mr Aitken
knew, must have known, and should have known about the sale of naval
guns to Iran between 1988-90.
I approached this chore with some enthusiasm. Mr Aitken is the kind of
rich, supercilious Tory who attracts little affection on his own side,
never mind among opponents. He was the one man regarded by Mrs Thatcher
as just too dodgy to promote, and her judgment was not always wrong.
Although an Aitken of the Beaverbrook publishing dynasty, this one
comes from the side of the family which lost out on the inheritance. His
wealth is largely self-made and is intimately tied up in his connections
with Middle Eastern potentates and the arms trade.
It was a singularly happy coincidence that this particular story
appeared just as Aitken was in the headlines anyway, for his assault on
the ''Blair Broadcasting Corporation'' -- a fanciful concept if ever I
heard one.
With his media background, Aitken was just the man to perform the
time-honoured Tory task of putting the frighteners on the BBC in advance
of a General Election. It was of no concern to Aitken that in order to
have a peg on which to hang his attack, it was necessary to sully the
professional reputation of a journalist of integrity, John Humphrys.
The Tories do this kind of thing for the simple reason that they know
it works.
For all the protestations to the contrary, news selection becomes just
a little more cautious and interviewing a degree more circumspect. They
didn't, for instance, touch the Aitken follow-up until they were sure
everyone else was running with it.
Whether, in the present political circumstances, any of this makes a
jot of difference is another question. The Tory capacity for
self-inflicted wounds might only be enhanced if they were all allowed
just to make their little speeches on the Today programme, before Mr
Humphrys said: ''Thank you, sir.''
But there is no doubt about the sinister intent, and that is one of
the factors which makes Aitken's current difficulties so satisfactory.
Without ever being interrupted by a subversive BBC interviewer, he has
managed to dig for himself a very large hole.
His explanations of how he allegedly knew nothing from the start of
his directorship to his last day in the job about ''Operation Lisi'' and
the #15m Iran contract are self-parodying. The services of an aggressive
interviewer are not required.
Aitken was paid #10,000 a year as a non-executive director of BMARC; a
position which carries with it some legal responsibility to know what is
going on. He had been brought into the company to help win new arms
deals, because of his connections.
Yet he never troubled to find out what contracts already existed. He
received the papers and attended the meetings, according to former
colleagues, but never managed to work out that something funny was going
on which a senior Tory MP should perhaps not be party to.
There were two hermetically sealed worlds within this quite small
company -- one which carried through embargo-busting arms deals with
Iran and another which Mr Aitken contained himself within. The case
rests.
But whatever this tale tells us about Aitken and his business
interests, it speaks even louder about the nature of government under
John Major. For Aitken went direct from the arms trade to the post of
Defence Procurement Minister with responsibility for preventing exactly
the kind of trade which BMARC was involved in.
Aitken has a well-developed brass neck and will try hard to brazen it
out. He might succeed. To lose such a senior Minister whom he has
personally elevated, would be an act of carelessness even by Mr Major's
standards. And he would, at the same time, anoint a potential leader for
the Euro-sceptics.
But there are many in politics and the media who believe that the
question about Aitken's departure is not so much ''if'' but ''when''.
The road to the General Election is strewn with some fairly exotic time
bombs and the Tories won't manage to embargo them all.
Back in the ''Blair Broadcasting Corporation'', a former Young
Conservative chairman, who is now deputy editor of Panorama, writes a
remarkably cynical memo about how transmission of a full-length
interview with Mr Major, three days before the Scottish local elections,
can be justified when other party leaders are not getting the same
treatment.
Mr Nick Robinson writes: ''My suggestion is that we say we have had a
bid in for the PM for some months which he has finally accepted . . . ''
The fact that this statement is false does not seem to trouble this
employee of an organisation whose obligation to ''Speak Truth Unto
Nations'' apparently does not apply to internal memos.
Personally, I would have no objections to Mr Major addressing us every
hour on the hour in the run-up to next Thursday's elections. It would do
wonders for the turn-out and kill off the Tory chances of holding even
Eastwood.

BRITISH Aerospace yesterday effectively revised and triggered the
second part of its two-stage rights issue -- the first, in November,
raised #170m -- aimed at funding its #570m bid for submarine and
warship-builder VSEL.
The bid, along with GEC's rival offer, is currently before the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, having been referred in December last
year.
But the MMC's report is due to go before President of the Board of
Trade Michael Heseltine on April 12 and BAe's cash-call signifies not
just confidence that it will be allowed to go ahead but the need to be
ready to counter cash-rich GEC, assuming it too gets the green light,
when the verdict comes.
GEC, of course, already owns Britain's only other large warship-maker,
Yarrow on the Clyde, and this will have been one aspect of the MMC
inquiry.
The BAe issue takes the form of a two-part and fully-redeemable
one-for-five issue at 430p a share. The first tranche of the rights
issue to raise #94m will be repaid plus interest if the cash element of
any bid could be financed from the #170m proceeds of the November issue.
The second instalment will be called only if the cash element exceeds
#264m. The announcement initially hit the share price but it later
recovered to close unchanged on the day at 486p. BAe chief executive
Dick Evans emphasised that the company had no idea of the outcome of the
MMC inquiry.
BAe had fought for the GEC offer to be referred to the MMC on the
grounds of Yarrow which it suggested would create a monopoly. GEC, for
its part, suggested this was a spurious argument, indeed a ''red
herring'', pointing out that Yarrow made small frigates whereas VSEL
made large ships and submarines, and that in any case Yarrow faced
competition from Vosper Thornycroft.
Apart from the commercial attractions of acquiring Trident submarine
group VSEL, there are also financial attractions for BAe. In its present
tax position it would be able to shelter VSEL's profits with the
enlarged group's tax charge at around 25% compared with over 30%, giving
a substantial boost to earnings per share.
BAe and VSEL had originally announced an agreement to merge their two
businesses on October 12 last year but this was scuppered when GEC
launched a counterbid towards the end of the month. GEC argues that by
acquiring VSEL it would mean two yards better able to compete in the
global market and provide a complete service in shipbuilding.
If the MMC does recommend that both BAe and GEC can renew their bids,
the two companies will again be at each other's throats. But they have
both discussed collaboration in the past and there are some in the
market who still think GEC may go for BAe itself in the longer term.

MR JONATHAN AITKEN survived the assault on his memory and integrity in
the House of Commons yesterday. The order for guns which ended up in
Iraq was placed some two years before he became a director of the
company exporting them, and he claimed to have been unaware of the whole
episode in spite of contrary claims by a national newspaper. The Prime
Minister endorsed him firmly, as did the Tory back benches. Unless
significant new evidence emerges, this incident will slip back into the
obscurity from which it has briefly emerged. It may leave a taste to the
disadvantage of Mr Aitken's longer-term career, for it begins to make
him look accident-prone. There is some unfairness there, and he may
prove to have brushed it off with conviction, along with the Al Fayed
affair; but those who advance men within his party may simply worry
about his political risk rating. On a less personal dimension, the
episode raises the prospect of the coming clash when the Scott Inquiry
(into the affair of monster guns for Iraq) is published later this year.
Almost everyone seems to have forgotten the Scott investigation, as no
doubt the Government would prefer. It is impossible to pre-judge the
findings but not hard to imagine the uproar they could provoke. Two
ministers at least have given themselves as hostages to its conclusions;
and the Government could as easily find its role exposed to collective
condemnation. An even wider matter -- because its difficulties must face
all British Governments -- is how the inquiry's findings impact on the
international arms trade which is so vital for much of British industry,
but particularly the hi-tech and precision-engineering industries. In
these industries the state permanently, as opposed to mere Governments
which come and go, has been deeply involved both as a provider of funds
(often for research and development) and even as a salesman at one
remove.
Like France, this country has a much larger defence industry than it
could afford by itself, but its size and capacities are essential to the
military and strategic assumptions of the Government. Both states have
financed this establishment by exporting weaponry round the world
(except to members of the communist bloc). The British defence industry
has none the less been regulated by discreet advice from the Civil
Service as well as the prevailing Government. It did not, for example,
sell equipment easily used in civil repression to South Africa. It was
not supposed to sell sophisticated weaponry to Iraq. It is, however,
hard to avoid selling items of expensive equipment to some respectable
customers who might secretly be passing them on (sales to Jordan, for
example, might simply be diverted to Iraq).  Customers who are
acceptable one day might not be the next. It is not always a trade for
the squeamish and, as is now well-known, it has a clandestine dimension
commensurate with the cost of its products and the unspeakable nature of
some of the regimes anxious to possess them. Reducing the defence
industries by restricting their exports even more is not an option which
would recommend itself to any British administration but, when the likes
of Saddam Hussein are empowered by its products, anxious introspection
is unavoidable. That at least will follow the Scott Report; and Mr
Aitken's suffering will look like a side-show.

TUMBLING markets in the Far East have taken their toll at the #56m
Martin Currie Pacific, where net asset value dropped by 18.1% to 135.5p
a share in the year to February 28, writes R E DUNDAS.
The Tiger markets in areas like Hong Kong and Singapore have been hit
by the rise in US interest rates and the weakness of the dollar, while
Japan has continued in the doldrums under pressure from the unremitting
strength of the yen. The Kobe earthquake in January was the final blow.
A sharply increased interest bill hit earnings per share which fell by
60% to 0.33p. The final dividend is being cut from 0.33p to 0.13p.
Martin Currie said that the only market in the region to produce a
positive return was Taiwan where 4% of the portfolio was invested at the
end of the year.
Japan accounted for the biggest slice of the portfolio at 35% on
February 28. Hong Kong had 12%, Singapore 10%, Malaysia 9%, Thailand 6%,
Australia 6% and New Zealand Government bonds 5%.
The trust's chairman, Tim Kimber, said: ''It has been a difficult year
for investors in the Pacific Basin, particularly in the last six
months.''
Nonetheless Martin Currie's confidence in the region's long-term
economic prospects has not been dented.

THE Government's quarrel with the BBC is an ill-advised encounter
which can only damage itself. It would quickly become a matter of public
concern if the BBC were politically biased: so much of its value is that
it is, or that its employees try to be, objective. That does not mean
that it should be anodyne in its presentation of the news or that its
interviewers be so lacking in sharpness as to let ministers, and those
who would be ministers in their stead, away with the bland productions
which make party political broadcasts an understandable switch-off. The
best place for questioning ministers, and especially Prime Ministers,
remains the House of Commons, where the audience is acutely sceptical
and lacking in deference (and sometimes even politeness); though it may
often be itself a less partisan place than it seems beneath the noise.
The BBC has a somewhat different aim from any set of political
practitioners in the Commons -- it is to present politicians to a wider
audience than their peers, and yet grill them somewhat.
This is usually well understood, as is the politicians' secret
resentment at much of the probing involved. Usually they accept the
exchange as being worthwhile -- they get the extra exposure they want to
public opinion, but pay the price exacted by well-informed and
tough-minded interviewers. This duality of feeling and calculation is
common to all political figures; and most have the self-confidence to
recognise that they actually improve their own performance the harder
they have to think on their feet. It is only when individuals are in
process of losing their self-confidence or Governments their collective
confidence, that all this is forgotten, and is replaced by cries of
''foul''. It is not too surprising that a Government which has
established new records of rejection in the opinion polls has been
shaken to the point where its paranoia becomes openly advertised. The
best reponse to their worries is that advocated by Sir Edward Heath who
advised ministers bluntly to drop the matter and get on with their work.
Strangely enough, the criticisms of the BBC, which have come from
other Governments before (notably Harold Wilson's), are never visited on
the press. The reason is the BBC's public status: ministers, especially,
perhaps, those of an administration which has been in power for 16
years, may imagine that it for that reason simply at their disposal. It
is not, it is independent of their power, and would soon cease to be of
much public worth if that position were eroded. Its unusual role, in
comparison with similar bodies in almost every other state, survives
because it is not partisan. Its employees are entitled to their views as
much as anyone else but neither they, nor those who direct them, are
generally seen as seeking to impose these on the rest of us in a manner
reminiscent of politicians themselves. Were a different analysis ever
discernible it would be obvious to more than members of a Government,
and the noise of whistles blowing could not be ignored. In the meantime
the Government seems to be trying to intimidate the BBC by throwing
weight about, just at the time when it seems to be especially
lightweight.

BRITAIN'S largest food discount group, Kwik Save, is making up to 470
people redundant through the closure of two distribution centres and a
temporary warehouse at a cost of about #9m, writes ANDREW WILSON.
The centres being axed are in Prestatyn, North Wales, and Frogmore in
Hertfordshire, and the warehouse at Winsford, Cheshire.
The company which bought the ailing Shoprite last November is sugaring
the oil, with the opening of a major distribution centre in
Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. That will create jobs for an initial
350 employees, later rising to 500. It is hoped to transfer some
existing employees to it.
Kwik Save has 965 stores including about 110 in Scotland as a result
of the Shoprite deal.
Chief executive Graeme Bowler put the blame on the necessity to cut
costs in the ''harsh and highly competitive trading environment, but it
is extremely sad that is is necessary to close facilities that have
provide valuable service for so many years''.

EXPORTS of Scotch whisky set a record last year by rising 4.7% to
#2191m to maintain the industry in the top five of British exporters.
The largest improvement was in sales to the southern states of the EU
and particularly to Spain which has overtaken France as the second most
important market. Turnover in Spain rose #17m to #205m compared with the
#197m sold into France.
Other markets to show significant advances were Greece with an 11%
improvement to #92m, a 22% rise in Italy to #72m and 17% to #55m in
Portugal. Altogether the EU excluding Britain consumed 37% of all Scotch
exports at #823m (#778m) -- the home market fell 1% to 37.323 million
litres of pure alcohol or 134 million bottles.
The US remains the biggest market at #284m and Japan is in fourth
position at #134m but both were down by around 5% by volume.
Scotch Whisky Association spokesman Campbell Evans pointed out that
while value had risen by almost 5%, volume had declined by 1.8% to 252
million litres of pure alcohol. That reflected the continuing trend of
consumers drinking less but drinking better and moving to the higher
quality brands.
Scottish-bottled exports continue to remain high at 89% of the total
and remain a vital factor in maintaining jobs in the industry. About
14,000 are employed in the sector but that contrasts with 26,000 in
1979.
The question of duty harmonisation in Europe remains unclear although
there is a ministerial conference due this summer to discuss the matter.
Brussels is trying to take Japan to court in an attempt to have a
level playing field in that country whereby all spirits are equally
taxed. Success there would serve as a warning to other developing
countries such as South Korea to make their markets more open to imports
of Scotch.

THE Bundesbank caught financial markets on the hop yesterday when it
cut its discount rate by half-a-point to 4%, the first reduction since
May 13 last year.
The Lombard rate was left unchanged at 6%, but it is only significant
when rates are rising. The repo rate was pared by 0.35% to 4.5%, the
first time it has been reduced since July.
The unexpected move had an electrifying effect on equity and bond
markets where prices rose sharply and sparked off a significant rally in
weak currencies, such as the pound and the dollar, which have been the
victims of the mark's unrelenting strength.
In London, it was a day of extraordinary volatility on the stock
market where the FTSE-100 share index traded at a low of 3131.7 ahead of
the Bundesbank announcement and a high of 3185.6 after it. The response
from Wall Street was relatively muted and the Footsie had to settle for
a gain of 33.9 points at 3176.2. Gilts were enlivened with gains of
around three-quarters.
The Austrian, Belgian, Dutch, and Swiss central banks quickly followed
the German lead with similar reductions in key interest rates. France,
which has had to raise rates to defend the franc, may be able to move at
a later stage.
The great enigma is Japan, whose official discount rate is already low
at 1.75%. The German move will add to speculation that the Bank of Japan
will soon cut this rate by half a point.
The yen and the mark have been carrying all before them this year in
the foreign exchange markets. A lengthy statement from the Bundesbank
yesterday sought to justify the rate reductions by signs of a slowdown
in the growth of the main measure of the German money supply.
It did concede that the rise in the mark had been a factor, but it
denied having a currency target and warned that the cut did not signal
''an all-clear as far as price stability is concerned.''
The German central bank had been under enormous international and
domestic pressure to ease rates in order to arrest the mark's climb.
Bundebank president Hans Tietmeyer had hinted about the possibility of a
rate cut, but analysts had not taken him seriously.
The Germans do not have a record of being good neighbours on the
world's often turbulent money markets. However, there is no doubt that
the strength of the mark has been hitting German exporters hard.
On Tuesday Volkswagen, which has staged a good recovery from losses in
1993, warned about the damage the mark was doing to its business. One of
its biggest markets is Italy -- the lira has been the weakest currency
in Europe.
The German cut came late in the monetary cycle when analysts were
beginning to speculate on when the first rise would take place. It was
all the more surprising, therefore, that the discount rate dropped by a
half point, rather than just a token quarter. But some analysts pointed
out that the decision to reduce the repo rate by 0.35% was a cautious --
and a clever -- move.
Germany is not without inflationary pressures, though its recovery
from recession is not nearly as far advanced as it is in the UK and the
US. Recent wage deals, including the one for the engineering industry,
have flashed warning signs to the authorities.
In the event, the cut may not last long, and around the middle of the
year the Bundesbank could be looking to tighten monetary policy.
Meantime, yesterday's relaxation is a boon to those ERM countries
outwith the Deutschmark bloc. One of the biggest beneficiaries was the
French bond and equity market.
Sterling made good headway against the mark, where it gained more than
three-and-a-half pfennigs to 2.2578, but it shed 1.05 cents to 1.5988.
The trade weighted index rose from 85.2 to 85.6.
Earlier this month, the pound established an all-time low of DM2.1890,
and although its subsequent recovery has been significant it has a long
way to go if it is to retrieve the DM2.42 level in place at the start of
the year.
It is a similar case with the dollar, which gained more than three
pfennigs and one yen on the back of the German move. The bounce-back
from record lows has been modest.
On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve stayed its hand on US interest rates
in response to signs of a slowdown in the domestic economy. But the
pundits still expect another rise in rates in the second quarter. It is
much the same outlook in the UK.
A rise in rates after the meeting on Wednesday between Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor George is firmly ruled out,
but early May is a favourite date among City analysts for the next
increase, probably half a point to 7.25%. Nothing the Bundesbank has
done is expected to alter that scenario.

NEWS of the proposed visit to Libya by the former Scottish Office
Minister, Allan Stewart, MP, is a shot in the arm to those who wish to
see truth and justice triumph in the Lockerbie case.
His initiative in proposing an enabling additional clause for the
Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, to allow Scottish law to function in a
court in another country, could only increase the chances of achieving a
''neutral-country trial''.
It has been said by Dr Ibrahim Legwell, lawyer for the accused, that
his clients could come to a trial under Scottish law in a neutral
country. The Libyan regime has said that it would not prevent them from
doing so.
It seems to us that there can be no progress without a fair trial, in
the face of these desperately serious accusations, and that the absence
of one is unfair to the accused and to those, like us, whose grief is
compounded by the lack of truth and justice.
If my experience is anything to go by, Mr Stewart will find the Libyan
regime ready to listen to any helpful suggestion, but he may also have
to counter a barrage of criticism from those elsewhere who already
assume the accused are guilty, and from those who say that Colonel
Gaddafi is a pariah who should not be approached by anyone in his right
mind.
If Mr Stewart's initiative is to progress it will depend upon the
goodwill of the Foreign and Commonwenalth Office, the Lord Advocate, and
whichever neutral country is asked to host the trial.
In addition it would be necessary that the Security Council be
prepared to accept that a Scottish court in a neutral country would be
an acceptable alternative to ''surrender for trial in the United Kingdom
or USA'', if the sanctions are to be lifted. Perhaps these are questions
which could be addressed behind the scenes while Mr Stewart quietly
pursues his initiative.
The creation of good relations between Libya and the United Kingdom
would be an immensely worthwhile end-product, but out of reach without a
trial. Nations which share their commerce (and their tourists) are less
likely to quarrel.
Good relations would be more likely following a ''neutral-country
trial'' achieved through Mr Stewart's initiative, than by trying to
browbeat Libya through oil embargoes and the like, which would damage
the welfare of ordinary Libyan citizens against whom we should have no
quarrel, whether their two fellow-citizens are eventually found guilty
or innocent.
We should all wish Mr Stewart ''Godspeed''.
Dr Jim Swire,
Caspidge House,
Pikes Pool Lane,

The Edinburgh International Festival director has again pulled out all
the stops with an enticing 1995 programme, reports Keith Bruce
WITH his fourth festival Brian McMaster has produced a programme that
is unarguably the most ambitious, coherent, and integrated that
Edinburgh has seen in many years.
Over all the performance art forms the Edinburgh International
Festival director has pulled out the stops. He claimed yesterday that
the festival had been ''intimidating to put together because last year
was perceived as such a success and we wanted to cap it''. The proof
will be in the performance, but on paper it is enticing.
In music and drama -- the founding subjects and core of the programme
-- the 1995 festival puts Edinburgh at the pinnacle of the promotion of
the arts in Europe. The dance programme -- almost exclusively from
across the Atlantic -- is a case apart but an important indication for
the future. The success of last year's event has surely emboldened him,
since he noted that the 1994 festival contained ''some fairly reckless
gambles''.
This year's music programme, in particular, contains a great deal of
work that is either very new or very unfamiliar. The Herald revealed
last September that Bernd Zimmermann's Requiem for a Young Poet -- never
before seen in the UK -- will be presented at the Usher Hall in a
co-production with four other European festivals. The Ensemble
Intercontemporain, under Pierre Boulez, returns with a programme of
Berg, Webern, Mahler, and Schoenberg at the Queen's Hall. There is a
showcase for Boulez's pupil, the Portuguese Emmanuel Nunes, with a
presentation of his almost site-specific Quodlibet in the McEwan Hall,
and Scottish contemporary composition has a series at BBC Scotland
studios in Queen Street with a world premiere in each concert.
Even the closing concert of the festival, a rescheduling of Gunter
Wand's direction of the NDR Symphony Orchestra in Bruckner's Eighth,
which was cancelled last year, is a brave stroke. It is also Bruckner
who opens the programme, his Ninth Symphony and Te Deum performed by the
Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester, conducted by Claudio Abbado, who is
making his first appearance in Edinburgh since 1986.
The St Petersburg Philharmonic contributes major works to a Dvorak
strand in the festival with Mariss Jansons conducting the Eighth
Symphony and Yuri Temirkanov the Seventh. The composer's Stabat Mater is
performed by the Philharmonia under John Eliot Gardner with a stellar
line-up of soloists and Sir Charles Mackerras conducts the RSNO
performance of his Requiem with another, including Scottish Opera
favourite Jane Eaglen.
Sir Charles also completes his festival cycle of concert performances
of Mozart/da Ponte operas, conducting the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and
a strong cast in Don Giovanni. Edinburgh-born Donald Runnicles conducts
the RSNO for two concerts, one of which capitalises on his reputation as
an interpreter of Wagner.
Scottish Opera's music director, Richard Armstrong, has remained
enthusiastic about Dvorak's opera The Jacobin since Welsh National Opera
staged an indifferent production when he was there alongside MacMaster.
Scottish Opera's production will open festivities at the Festival
Theatre.
It is followed by a new opera work by John Adams, whose Nixon in China
was a previous festival coup. I Was Looking At The Ceiling And Then I
Saw The Sky is directed by Peter Sellars and opens, appropriately, in
California in May, since it concerns the recent earthquake. By contrast
the next residents at the Festival Theatre are the Kirov Opera with a
double bill of Rimsky-Korsakov, The Legend Of The Invisible City Of
Kitezh, and Sadko, conducted by Valery Gergiev, with Galina Gorchakova
(who also has another recital after last year's Queen's Hall triumph)
singing on the opening nights.
The European-centred programme is continued in the theatre fare, which
consolidates previous links with Germany and expands into France. The
British Isles team puts in a strong showing. Glasgow's TAG Theatre
Company returns to the Assembly Hall -- scene of its Scots Quair triumph
two years ago -- with its adaptation of Alasdair Gary's Lanark, and the
Citizens' stages Schiller's Don Carlos. The Abbey Theatre returns with
Patrick Mason's production of Frank McGuiness's Observe the Sons of
Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, a timely hit at last year's Dublin
Theatre Festival and described by McMaster as ''the greatest play I've
seen in the past 20 years''.
Director Peter Zadek also returns with the Berliner Ensemble,
following last year's Antony and Cleopatra with The Merchant of Venice,
an acclaimed production first seen in Vienna in 1988. The cast includes
Gert Voss as Shylock, who also appears with Berlin's Schaubuhne in The
Illusionist, one of two Luc Bondy productions of the work of French
writer Sacha Guitry, a contemporary of Noel Coward.
He is probably less known in Britain than Bernard-Marie Koltes, whose
Dans la Solitude des Champs de Coton is presented by the Odeon-Theatre
de L'Europe at a new venue, the Drill Hall in Forest Road, directed by
Patrice Chereau, whose film La Reine Margot is currently an art-house
film hit, and who has not produced work in Britain for 20 years.
The dance programme brings back Mark Morris (see Mary Brennan
opposite), Pina Bausch, Bill T Jones -- whose Still/Here has already
attracted considerable controversy, and Miami City Ballet, which
presents the first performance of Balanchine's Nutcracker in Britain,
complementing and contrasting with Morris's interpretation, The Hard
Nut.
Its apparent ''conservatism'' marks a process of audience-building
that can also be detected elsewhere: many performances -- like a series
of Schubert song-and-sonata recitals by tenor Peter Schreier and pianist
Andras Schiff -- inter-relate, an integration in programming that
McMaster believes is reflected in ticket sales. He hopes that the loyal
festival following enjoyed by the dance companies will be echoed in
theatre (Zadek) and music (Schiff and Boulez).
But there is still room for those personal touches. As part of a song
recital series he presents 75-year-old Mexican Chavela Vargas, whose
alcohol intake -- he noted admiringly -- totalled an estimated 40,000
litres of tequila before she gave up three years ago. Then there's Neal
Davies, the young baritone who spurned McMaster's invitation to work
with WNO to study lieder. He appears at the Queen's Hall singing lieder.
''So we'll see if that was worth while,'' noted the director drily.
And as for the trendy European feel of the festival? ''It's not
deliberate -- I saw several things from further-flung places, but I
didn't see anything I fancied.''
Chance, as they say, is a fine thing.

WE can't all be winners, as American film-maker Jurgen Vsych will tell
you. Jurgen submitted her wee movie Son for Sail to the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Science in the same Oscar category which was
eventually won by oor ain Peter Capaldi.
As well as the disappointment of spending her life savings on making
the film and then not being nominated, there was a further insult when
Jurgen phoned the Oscar folk to get her $1000 print back. They couldn't
find it, but further investigation revealed it was being used as a door
stop in the department responsible for the safe-keeping of the movies
entered.
But Jurgen has a sense of humour. Her production company is called
Wroughten Films. Some people think she means her work is rotten; she
points out it is merely well-wrought. Jurgen spent two years working in
Glasgow and says she has always admired Peter Capaldi's work.
There is some consolation for Jurgen as her film will be shown in the
near future on Channel 4.
Not so keen to jump
at the chance
YOUR average MP finds it hard to refuse an invitation to help a
charity, especially if it based in his or her constituency. The Ayrshire
Hospice is having a fund-raiser next month at Ayr Race Course, part of
which involves a bit of kit called the Sky Rider.
The Sky Rider is a projectile attached to bungee-style ropes which
affords the occupants the opportunity to sample some of the fun of a
trip into space.
Local MP Phil Gallie has been asked to be sponsored for a quick hurtle
in the Sky Rider. He agreed on condition that an Ayrshire Labour MP was
his fellow passenger.
George Foulkes was the first to be approached. He managed to come up
with the excuse that he has to address a meeting of the Co-operative
Party on the day in question.
Brian Donohue was the next to be approached. He says he will be
delighted to help out. He will make the speech to the Co-op people to
allow Foulkesie to go on the Sky Rider.
Deadpan humour
US CHAPS on the Diary just love the guid old Scots phrases. We are
pleased to pass on this from Bob Macdonald of Overtown, Wishaw: ''The
recent spate of shootings in Paisley gives a whole new meaning to the
old saying -- Ah dinnae ken whether to hing masel, droon masel, or gang
tae Paisley.''
OUR photograph of old folk at play comes from a glossy brochure
produced by Winslow Elderly Care. It depicts an activity involving
something called the Parachute Pack. It is described as ''particularly
good for encouraging social interaction and laughter, as well as
encouraging arm exercises and general exertion''. It comes in four sizes
''for use in every indoor or outdoor situation with groups varying in
size from three or four people to much larger numbers''.
Among the many books listed in the catalogue are Looking at Confusion,
Wandering, and Screaming and Shouting. Kits are also available for
Feeding and Swallowing Workshops.
A volume we thought particularly appropriate for the Diary -- Over the
Hill and Far Away, which is described as a ''training package''.
The Name Game
RECENTLY elected as joint chairman of Stirling University Graduates
Association -- a Mr Bent and a Mr Gentleman. An Elizabeth McIntosh is
standing for the Labour Party in Renfrewshire. And her nominator is:
John Major. No, not the chap from Downing Street, but the one from Esk
Avenue.
Climax of The Convener's Tale
WE have come, sadly, to the last instalment of The Convener's Tale,
the story of the odyssey to China of a Tayside Regional Council trade
delegation.
New readers, and we always welcome new readers, begin here:
Frances Duncan, Tayside convener, returns from her trip to China and
decides to commit her experience for posterity in a booklet published by
the region. From leaving husband Ron's dinners in the freezer to
banquets in the People's Republic, all human life is there. Returning to
her Far Eastern experiences, we pick up the story at yet another
banquet, this time in Sanya City, ''the Hawaii of China''.
We discover that apart from Chinese food there are roast beef and lots
of other dishes for which we have craved all week. It is only now I
realise how I have missed using a fork and knife. I have become such an
expert with chopsticks I can even lift peanuts!!!
Our hosts have certainly given us delicacies, the likes of which none
of us has seen, far less eaten. We have eaten much raw fish,
particularly garoupa. The head is severed and placed before the guest of
honour who is expected to eat the eyes, huge teeth, and all. Yes, it
always looked me straight in the face. Funny how we appeared to get a
lot of garoupa.
We ate toad's chest and stomach and many other unmentionables, such as
small birds, in their entirety and goose-webbed feet.
But now it is time to take leave of Haikou and return to Tayside.
Our police escort wails its way through the streets which have been
cleared specially for our journey to the airport. The officers on point
duty salute.
On the flight to Hong Kong I reflect on what I have seen and heard.
Poverty, partially-built houses, flats and factories abandoned, poor
road conditions and services, school buildings in need of repair (how
unlike Tayside -- Ed), coconut trees everywhere, rice fields worked the
same now as they were centuries ago.
The convener pauses briefly in Hong Kong on her way home to Dundee.
Hong Kong, Sunday: It may have been the Sabbath but it was certainly
no day of rest for us. We decided not to waste the day but to see the
sights and visit the famous Stanley market. Here I was able to enjoy
buying clothes which were either much less expensive than at home or
more unusual, and sometimes both.
That evening I decided not to join the others in seeing the night life
of Hong Kong. The previous week's activities were beginning to catch up
with me and I was desperate for some ''prime time'' to myself.
Tuesday, January 24: Arrived home in Tayside after 10 long days of
sunshine and a hectic programme and have returned feeling grateful for
the way of life which we experience here in our region.
* Adapted without permission from Convener's Trade Mission to China,
published by Tayside Regional Council and surely a candidate for next
year's Booker Prize.

LET me start with an apology. Last Saturday, in a sceptical piece
about what official statistics are telling us about the state of the
real economy, I ventured that I had heard our own Secretary of State on
BBC's Question Time, predicting the Scottish economy would grow by 5% in
each of the next two years.
Against historic trend growth of little more than 2% a year, I found
this, shall we say, awfully optimistic. Mr Lang's people have gently
pointed out that what the minister actually said was that the Scottish
economy will grow by 5% over the next two years. They've checked the
tapes. I stand corrected. They are not pushing for a public apology. In
the interests of accuracy, I offer it, none the less.
I do, however, just wonder how many other sleepy watchers in the night
might have been more impressed by that emphasis on 5%, albeit over two
years, than they would have been by two years of two-and-a-half per cent
growth (only marginally above trend). But that, of course, is all part
of the politician's art.
Having publicly confessed my small sin, I now feel sufficiently
cleansed to comment on another recent foray by Mr Lang on to the
airwaves. Early last week he talked, from Brussels, with BBC Radio
Scotland's Kenny Macintyre. Pressed by the persistent Macintyre about
Cabinet splits over Europe, the Scottish Secretary launched into a
remarkable distinction. I've checked the tapes this time.
He said: ''There's a far more realistic perception of what Europe is
all about when you are in Europe . . . than when you are debating these
issues and reading about them at home.''
In Europe? At home? I must confess I found the way the Scottish
Secretary chose to contrast the two intensely depressing. Mr Lang is a
Major loyalist. No Euro-sceptic he. But here he was implying that, more
than 20 years after we joined the European Community, Europe is still
that other place, across the water, where they think differently from
the way we do. If that's the mind-set of one of the Cabinet's more
pro-European members, is it any wonder that some of the others snarl
with ill-concealed contempt at every new initiative to emerge from
Brussels or Strasbourg?
On occasions some of Mr Lang's colleagues birl wildly on the spot in
the space of a few hours, arguing contradictory positions with
consistent fervour, to put distance between Britain's stance and that of
''Europe''. Thus, last weekend, when seven of our partners, under the
Schengen accord, lifted all internal border controls, the talk from
Whitehall was of a green light to drug smugglers, other criminal
elements, and the prospect of being swamped by a flood of undesirable
immigrants from the East and Africa.
Within 24 hours arch-sceptic Michael Portillo was off to ''Europe'' to
block a proposal that host-country wages and conditions should apply to
all workers, including those from other EU states. ''We believe in the
free movement of goods, services, capital, and people,'' said Portillo.
People? Don't forget your passport, people, he might have added.
This sceptical span of attitudes to our membership of the European
Union -- from Ian Lang's infelicitous distinction between them and us to
Michael Portillo's naked hostility -- is beginning to worry business. At
Wednesday's grandiose Britain In the World conference in London, Peter
Bonfield, chairman of computer company ICL, gave voice to the fears.
Mr Bonfield warned that Britain risks being marginalised within Europe
and ignored by the rest of the world unless we come to terms with the
economic realities of our European membership. With ICL 80%-owned by
Fujitsu of Japan, Mr Bonfield went on to warn that continued uncertainty
over British attitudes to Europe will diminish our attractions as a
location for inward investment.
That echoes a sub-theme in the academic paper by Professor Neil Hood,
the former Locate in Scotland director, given prominence in Tuesday's
Herald. Professor Hood challenged the Tory allegation that Scottish
devolution, on the model currently proposed by Labour, would frighten
away foreign multinational investment from our shores. Hood went on to
argue that continued uncertainty over Britain's attitude to a single
European currency far outweighs devolution in the calculations being
made by potential inward investors.
Not everyone, I hasten to add, agrees with that part of Hood's
analysis. At that same Britain In The World conference, Ms Haruko
Fukuda, vice-chairman of securities house Nikko Europe, reportedly
argued that Japanese companies with plants in Britain would prefer us to
stay outside any single currency mechanism, because that would offer
them a more competitive exchange rate to work with.
Fukuda, doubtless reflecting on the challenges posed for domestic
Japanese industry by the rapidly escalating value of the yen in global
currency markets, sounds like someone chasing the best of all possible
worlds. Of course a UK location within the EU's tariff walls and a weak
sterling to boot is a pretty unbeatable combination if you are trying to
sell Derbyshire-made Toyota cars or East Kilbride-made JVC consumer
electronics to the EU's near 400 million consumers.
But, were the current tide of Euro-scepticism convulsing the Tory
Party to become a realistic prospect of actual British withdrawal, the
alarm bells would ring deafeningly in Tokyo, whatever strength the pound
happened to be enjoying at the time. Japanese and American investors
might find it difficult to disengage from some existing plants -- it is
not easy to uproot a semiconductor wafer fab or, indeed, a car-assembly
plant and put it somewhere else. But we could certainly kiss goodbye to
new investment.
In recent weeks ministers have shown themselves adept at spreading
scare stories about the cost of home rule. A 20p-in-the-pound tax rise
here. A flight of foreign investment there. It's time the economic
consequences of the Government and the Tory Party's own inability to
come to terms with Europe were exposed. The price could prove enormous.

<TEXT>
THE COUNCIL of Mortgage Lenders has called upon the Government to
rethink major parts of its proposals on income support for mortgage
interest (ISMI). These would effectively mean removing support for many
categories and has raised a storm of criticism that it will add to the
woes of a still fragile housing market as well as causing personal
hardship.
Responding to the Social Security Advisory Committee, which has been
collecting views on the issue, the CML yesterday said it is concerned
about the possible impact which proposals could have, in particular on
the arrangements for existing borrowers, the position of lone parents
and carers, and the need to ensure that a work disincentive is not
created.
The CML believes that the assumptions on which the policy is based are
outdated and mistaken. Among various Government claims cited is the
contention that ISMI is a growing burden on social security programme
expenditure.
The CML said expenditure has, in fact, been falling for two years. The
annual cost dropped from a peak of #1270m in February 1993 to #1082m in
February 1994, and this decline of almost #200m in a single year is
equivalent to the total savings the Government eventually expects to
make as a result of the changes it is proposing.
The Government's claim that in some cases it provides a disincentive
to work is also contested. DSS statistics themselves that 40%-50% of
claimants come off benefits during the first 16 weeks of a claim because
they have obtained work, while it is the elderly, disabled and lone
parents who are more likely to be claimants.
The CML believes that far from the current system of ISMI constituting
a work disincentive, the proposed changes could create this effect.
On the Government's assertion that ISMI provides claimants with the
scope to obtain a capital gain, the CML pointed out that since 1989
house prices in most areas have fallen between 15% and 30%. The concern
that claimants might be able to benefit from ISMI in cash terms ought
therefore, in the view of the CML, to be the least of the Government's
worries.
The CML said it is particularly unhelpful that reductions in state
support should be implemented at a time when households are trying to
adjust to other serious changes, such as low inflation (both generally
and in house prices), less secure employment and reduction in mortgage
interest tax relief.

Ken Smith examines the
importance of continuing economic
initiatives after the polls
MORE than #9m of business with companies abroad is at risk if the
economic strategies of the new councils are unable to match the work
already done by Strathclyde region.
That is the estimated amount of export trade generated by Strathclyde
Business Development's programme of trade missions, which provides about
half of all such missions out of Scotland.
Yet the councils being created are unlikely to be large enough to have
the spread of companies to justify mounting such missions themselves.
Nor will the councils be able to have the same clout in Europe as
Strathclyde, which is why tentative talks are taking place about forming
a Scotland West Economic Forum to represent the new councils in Europe.
It will not be an attempt to recreate Strathclyde however. Not only
would it be resisted politically by the new councils, dominated as they
will be by former district councillors, but in economic terms it is
likely to be more tightly focused on the Clydeside conurbation rather
than stretching from the south of Ayrshire up into Argyll.
One concern about the economic development work carried out by the
regions is that it is a discretionary function and not a statutory one.
In other words, the new councils do not by law have to become involved
in economic initiatives.
The danger is that they become so obsessed with working out how they
will deliver the services they have to, that the discretionary services
will simply fall off the end of the list, and the expertise built up by
Strathclyde Business Development and similar agencies will be lost.
On balance, this probably will not happen. In the past 10 years
councillors have grown aware of the importance of economic development
and are keen to become involved, rather than simply leaving it to the
then Scottish Development Agency and now the local enterprise companies.
At a very basic level, economic growth and attracting fresh businesses
can increase the spending power of councils by increasing their rates
base. More subtly, the more people who are employed locally means a
smaller drain on expensive services such as social work because of the
problems poverty can create.
Some of the economic services would benefit from being delivered
across a wider area than simply the individual councils. The Employment
Grants Scheme, for example, has helped to create 32,000 jobs in
Strathclyde. Twelve separate schemes among the new councils are unlikely
to have the same success.
But just as councillors are now aware of the benefits of economic
development, it also means they will be reluctant to give up the control
of such initiatives to other bodies.
If a new factory is going to open up because of council help, then the
local councillor will want to make sure he or she gets the credit for
it, with a picture in the local paper. A little local recognition is
greatly sought after.
Co-operation between individual councils and other agencies such as
the LECs therefore will have to be very delicately negotiated, and not
be seen as being imposed on the councils.
Mr Garrath Le Sueur, director of Strathclyde Business Development,
recognises that there are also financial problems in the changeover. He
says the danger would be if the new authorities decide to wait to see
what cash is allocated to them by the Scottish Office in December -- and
all the indications are that it will be tight. If that is the case, then
economic development, being discretionary, will be squeezed.
More complicated, but far more effective, he argues, is for the new
authorities within the first couple of months to draw up their own plans
for economic development, giving it its rightful place among council
services, and therefore protected from being financially squeezed more
than other services.
He said: ''When times are hard businesses do not cut their sales
forces, as that is what brings the money in. Similarly, if councils are
subject to financial pressures, one of the best ways to deal with it is
to try to develop growth in the local economy.
''It's something they can't ignore. The choice is we limit our
economic development contribution or think very seriously about how we
tailor our strategic services so as to encourage growth.''
The new councillors will no doubt agree. Whether they will have the
time with all the other areas competing for attention is perhaps the
biggest challenge they face.

OH! GODSEND. Every columnist in the British islands was presented but
recently with a small booklet called The Media Yearbook. This is but
another production from the fecund mind of Carrick Publishing. Carrick
also do journalist handbooks and maps of Scotland and the like and very
good they are at it too. But the yearbook is a stoatir: will keep
columnists in columns and even wee monographs for years. I am the very
man to reveal it to you all. For the next year you will be assailed by
columnists telling you of the most remarkable anniversaries, and basing
their thousand words or so upon the circumstance.
I don't mean personal anniversaries, such as Jack Webster telling you
of the first auction at Maud or when Malcolm Forbes came out. To the
North-east that is. Or when a collection of chaps who never went to war
tell you what it was like during it. No, the media booklet gives you
opportunities to ruminate on the past, and plenty of it for the scribes
like myself. Columnists will be scribbling upon anniversaries for the
next three years, believe me.
The first few entries are splendid. Turns out that on the 2nd of April
George MacDonald Fraser, author of Flashman books and McAuslan,
wonderful books altogether, will be 70 years of age. ''George MacDonald
Fraser, author of blah blah, will be 70 this week. Candia McNeedmoney
celebrates his life and times on page . . .''
On April 15 the first Ulster Parliament kicked off 70 years ago. ''As
we see the first six months of the peace process it is seemly to
consider the first stirrings of democracy in that tragic province which
now offers so much hope. . .'' The 7th of May gives us two nice ones, as
Germany surrendered to the Allies 50 years back and the Lusitania was
sunk by a German submarine with the loss of 1198 lives 30 years before
that. What joy it is to get all this marvellous material for columns,
features, photies resplendent, by-lines refulgent, and money for old
rope.
This year is going to be splendid anyway with all this VE stuff. The
Battle of Berlin ended with the German surrender on May 2, 1945. What
started on the same day was VHF broadcasting in Britain 10 years after.
Perhaps not as important as the Battle of Berlin but nice for Joyce
McMillan to do a wee piece upon. On the very last day of May, the 31st,
Clint Eastwood turns 65. Now he can turn his oft-worn poncho to good
use: he can drape it over his zimmer. Let us not be cruel to Clint. I
enjoy the simple fact that he is even baldier than me.
In June the Duke of Edinburgh is 74. ''A consort without a crown. It
is said that Prince Philip has been disappointed in life . . .'', and in
the same month Prince William is 13 years of age -- ''it is said that
Prince William is a manly boy who does nothing whatsoever to his
handkerchiefs and is not likely to go blind yet . . .'' Next month
Doctor Barnardo is born 150 years before. The orphanages will go
crackers. The press will discover that Barnardo is alleged to have
possessed an unhealthy interest in children. After all, Charles Dodgson
was a close friend . . .
By July 23 we are going to have the totality of drivel: it happens to
be the 250th anniversary of the landing of Bonnie Prince Charlie in
Eriskay. Amid all the shortbread, tartanry, and all round
to-the-King-across-the-water will be the fact that one of England's
thickest, who would hardly have existed had Charlie got past Derby,
married a fat lassie with a heid like a bottle of Irn-Bru. Randy Andy
wed fat ginger-heided Sadie. The next day is the first coming to power
of the Labour Party 50 years ago. After 50 years and thick Saxe-Coburgs
are still shagging fat red-headed fishwives and divorcing them as though
it were still the reign of George III.
I told you: this is a prize to a columnist, and to every hack. Every
day we look up this grand wee booklet and think up mince. February 1996
sees the 20th anniversary of the execution of 14 British mercenaries in
Angola -- ''20 years on we look at the world of the British mercen . .
.''
The 31st of March, today in fact, bestows upon us all the immortality
of the first zip fastener being patented. I knew you'd like that. The
10th of August hasn't much. The first Henry Wood Promenade concert was
on that day. Some Cornhill cricket match appears next year. It has this.
It is my birthday next year and the year and years after that. Should I
live so long. If you think the 10th of August is bad, you should see the
16th -- that's our Willie Hunter's birthday. On that day the official
unemployment figures come out.

NORTH West Water cheered its stock market sector yesterday with a plan
to share the benefits of efficiency gains equally with shareholders and
customers.
It is paying a special dividend of 3.8p and rebating #6.50 to each
customer. The move sets a precedent for the sector and is expected to be
followed by similar plans from the other water companies. North West
shares jumped 14p to 542p.
The group expects it to be more than a one-off deal, with continuing
special dividends for the next five years. The first one will be paid in
October.
''Provided the curent regulatory principles prevail at the next
review, the group sees no reason why distributions in this manner should
not be sustained beyond 2000,'' declared chairman Sir Desmond Pitcher.
The move was welcomed by water industry regulator Ian Byatt, who
stated: ''Wherever water companies make significant savings through
increased efficiency, Ofwat would like to see these savings shared
equally between customers and shareholders.''
North West's dividend growth will be underpinned by reducing cover
from the present three times to twice by the year 2000.
The payments plan follows completion of the first five-year capital
spending programme, which, according to the group, achieved everything
hoped for at a lower cost than anticipated. Similar savings are expected
from the current #2300m spending programme for the next five years. In
addition further #180m of long-term work will be brought forward.
With the second half of its trading year nearly complete, North West
reports that its utility business made solid progress. But sales of
process equipment has slowed and the international division has
experienced delays as a result of political factors in Malaysia and
Mexico.

DO YOU live in Rammy Street? As the Environment Ministers of Scotland,
England, and Wales tinker, in their different ways, with proposals to
silence noisy neighbours with on-the-spot fines (by slapping tickets
across their mouths, perhaps?) Edinburgh District Council takes its own
initiative. ''A noise annoys'' is the slogan of its new public
information campaign; and to engage the attention of the capital's
cacophonous citizens the council has invented an anti-social cartoon
family called Rammy Street Neighbours.
Neighbours . . . Ramsay Street . . . Rammy Street . . . get it? A
hemisphere away the tenacious Australian soap enters the civic
consciousness to become white propaganda in the control of council-house
tenants. An everyday story of global villagers.
Those who live in pre-war private-sector housing tend to be less
troubled by Them Nextdoor, if only because their walls are thicker, but
they are not immune from either causing or receiving disturbance.
Sandstone blocks may repel the raised voice or rogue CD more effectively
than breeze blocks, but there are other ways of penetrating the
soundproofing.
My first married home was the top flat of a Victorian terrace. Great
view, big rooms, but a little -- how shall I put it? --
undercapitalised. Much needed to be done. The ''home improvements''
eventually drove our distraught downstairs neighbours to negotiate
privately with our builders and tradesmen. They said nothing to us, not
a word of complaint, but they took to noting the phone numbers displayed
on the visiting Transits and screaming down the line to startled
functionaries at head office. The drama climaxed when they invaded the
premises of our carpet suppliers and demanded to know when they would be
finished fitting them.
After several notes of apology and a large bunch of flowers we were
able to exchange smiles on the stairs. They were elderly; I made
allowances; despite the fact that the workforce exited at 5pm and it was
hard to find a silent way of restoring the fireplaces and covering the
floors of our property. But while the experience has made me
teeth-clenchingly tolerant of other people's improving thumps and bangs
(the moment must come when the walls won't bear any more shelves or
release space for any more pictures) I am anything but saintly about
other kinds of noise pollution.
''Silence,'' says the veteran travel writer Wilfred Thesiger, ''has
vanished from the world.'' And there speaks a man who lives in a remote
Masai village in Kenya but who, presumably, can't escape the whine of
the 4WD (as we old bush hands call Jeeps and Land-Rovers) or the roar of
the Cessna.
When did silence vanish from the world? Perhaps in the sixties, when
so much else was thrown out. True, the internal combustion engine had
already changed the nature of our towns and the vacuum cleaner was well
installed as domestic loudmouth, but we still had Jean Metcalfe on
Family Favourites gently reminding listeners to ''turn the volume down''
if they were listening to their radios in the garden or ''beside an open
window'' on summer days.
Ha! With a Song in My Heart is now the least of the Sunday menaces. I
grudge most the loss of silence to summer gardens which seldom raised
their noise level above a dozy drone. Time was when you could fall
asleep to the sound of people mowing their lawns, but these days you
might as well sunbathe beside the M8. The curse of the Flymo; the blight
of the Black and Decker. Near where we live there are folk who even have
some kind of power tool for cutting stone. It feels like a cheesecutter
slicing through your brain.
We must be the last people on earth to own and use a hand-pushed
lawnmower. Even in India they get buffalo to pull the mowers on the
grass which borders the Rajpath in New Delhi, and they let cows and
goats nibble the rest. True, our city house has no great spread of
velvet lawn, but neither do those of our neighbours. If the required
manual labour is beyond the might of their white-collar muscles, would
it not be more socially responsible, in a pro-active kind of way, to
junk their energy-consuming Flymos and turn the job over to some
unemployed youth who, for a fiver, would restore the purr of summer with
the sound of blade-on-blade?
Perhaps the loss of silence is only a problem for the middle-aged and
upwards, but while it sometimes seems that the young have made some sort
of evolutionary adjustment to their aural equipment I'm not convinced.
Babies don't like loud noises, although they make plenty; toddlers put
their hands over their ears when the alarm sounds or the Hoover sucks;
and when, in extremis, I resort to the fishwife school of mothering a
look of pain crosses my daughter's face and she shouts, ''Don't shout at
me!''
Something happens to their ears when they discover pop music, and from
then on they become strangers to silence. If I had three months left to
live I'm not sure how I would spend it: with a precision sling-shot,
picking off boy racers in baseball caps who share their stereo systems
with you at traffic lights, or with a long pole, knocking revved-up
motor cyclists off their bikes.
Silence and youth are incompatible, something which poets knew
instinctively even before the age of the ghetto-blaster. ''And silence
sounds no worse than cheers/After death has stopped the ears,'' wrote A
E Housman, in his verses To an Athlete Dying Young. But where in the
world do the rest of us go when we want to recover the sound of silence,
or even something of its quality before Power Rangers took over the
planet? The countryside? The plush hush of a West Highland glen? We
won't escape the chain saw, the stalker's 4WD, and the low-flying jet
fighter. The city? A city without cars, a medieval time warp, a sublime
pedestrian precinct? Venice has the vaporetto, juggernaut of the Grand
Canal, and the belching barge and the powerboat taxi.
Thesiger is right. Silence has vanished from the world, even from the
African bush; although it has to be said that the bush has always been
noisier than you might think. I have in my possession a cassette
recording made at dawn in the middle of the Okavango Delta, on the edge
of the Kalahari Desert, hundreds of miles from the nearest dirt road.
Talk about Rammy Street -- you've never heard such a row: screeching
monkeys and wheezing tree frogs, warblers and whistlers, and a bird with
a voice like a rusty hinge -- the grey lowrie, or ''go-away bird'',
rasping ''go away''.
It's a mistake to imagine that silence is a gift of the natural world.
The RSPB are trying to re-establish the corncrake on the island of Coll,
and I have some sympathy with the older islanders who say the noise of
the bird's mating ''crake'' through the night used to get on their
nerves. ''But,'' they add, ''it would still be nice to have them back
again.''
I suppose what we all really want is the opportunity to choose our own
noise.

<HEADLINE>Redland slashes dividend.  Final payment cutby a third to 11.17p</HEADLINE>

REDLAND has slashed its dividend despite reporting a one-third jump in
profits for 1994 and the surprise news wiped 22p off the shares at 445p.
To provide more funds for capital investment, Redland has cut its
final dividend by 33% to 11.17p and this year's interim will go down in
a like proportion to 5.5p.
Profits rose 34% to #373m, but prospects are more problematic. Chief
executive Robert Napier yesterday said housebuilding permit data from
Germany and Holland are encouraging but the outlook for volume growth in
the UK and France is uncertain and prospects in the US are mixed.
Earnings from Redland's UK, French, and US interests have not picked
up as much as directors had hoped, while 51% owned Braas in Germany has
seen a surge in earnings as a result of the building boom in eastern
Germany.
Braas distributes about a third of its earnings to shareholders while
Redland has distributed 94% in recent years. The group said the effect
of these differentials plus the cash outflow from unrelieved advance
corporation tax has restricted resources available to develop the
business, apart from Braas. This business had a cash inflow of #88m
while the rest of the group had an outflow of #45m last year.
Now Redland feels it should be investing more to maintain its leading
market positions through developing new products, extending geographical
spread and increasing efficiency. Apart from the dividend action it
intends to raise Braas's distribution ratio; sell its 49% of Monier in
Australia to the majority partner for #88m; and repay its $250m of
preferred stock.
The measures will improve earnings per share by 10%, reduce gearing
(currently 36%) and raise interest cover.
Last year, Braas saw a 22% rise in roofing sales with concrete tile
volume in eastern Germany jumping 39%, and margins widening as unit
costs fell. The boom is continuing, with second-half housing permits up
21% in the east.
Tile sales in France increased 22% as the housing market picked up and
other European countries were ahead. Demand also improved in the UK,
where operating profits were up 78% at #41m, representing 11% of the
group total.
Analysts were critical of Redland for not acting sooner over the
dividend, which they argued left the group not as well prepared to take
advantage of the upturn as it should have been. But further share
weakness is likely to attract buyers keen to ride the upturn in the
building cycle.

THE Government was told yesterday that it has been taken ''for a
ride'' by National Lottery operator Camelot.
Lord Donoughue, for Labour, protested at Question Time that the
company's estimated profit between #1500m and #2000m over its seven-year
licence period was ''very high''.
He said 26% of takings, not 28% as originally promised, was being
given to good causes from the Lottery.
Prizes amounted to 48% instead of 50% and the share going to Camelot
was currently 11% instead of 5.8%, he told peers.
''Was such a high return for Camelot the Government's original
intention in disposing of this public monopoly licence to print money or
was it perhaps taken a little for a ride?'' he demanded.
Junior National Heritage Minister Lord Astor said: ''I really can't
comment on the speculative figures you use. We don't know what the
turnover of the National Lottery will be in future -- that will depend
on its success.''
Earlier, Lord Astor said Camelot was expected to retain between 5% and
6% to cover operating costs and profits during the licence period.
Camelot had been chosen because it ''maximised the return for good
causes'', Lord Astor said. ''Camelot's retention of revenue was the
lowest of all the applicants.''
Lord Astor said that by the Lottery's 19th week there had been sales
of #1120m , with prizes of #505m, 177 jackpot winners and 21 million
winners overall. Tickets now were being sold in 19,000 outlets and
proceeds for good causes were running at #292m.

David Belcher blubs, swoons, and oscillates wildly to the new BMX
album.
IF you don't already have your tickets for tonight's Teenage Fanclub
show at King Tut's, you're too late. In common with each other date the
band has staged during this week's three-gig Glasgow mini-tour,
tonight's is sold out.
You should, of course, sate your appetite for live music by skipping
across Glasgow's city centre to see the ageless Tycoon of Twang, Dick
Dale, at the Garage tonight, where he will be supported by Scotland's
verra ain surf-maestros, the Beat Poets. Likewise, you should instantly
purchase Gettin' Dirty, the latest single by the BMX Bandits, tonight's
support to their Creation label-mates, the aforementioned Teenage
Fanclub.
As well as reminding you what you're missing at King Tut's, it ought
to convince you to order your copy of the BMX Bandits' upcoming album,
also entitled Gettin' Dirty. As well as all the usual guitar-type stuff,
this makes restrained use of a full instrumental palette. Clavichord,
flute, pedal-steel guitar, vibes.
Most importantly, Gettin' Dirty is imbued with a rare pure-pop
sensibility. Aye, the BMX Bandits would seem to be celebrating their
tenth anniversary by offering the world a heart-stopping, breath-taking
compendium of lovelorn tunesmithery at its most touching.
Indeed, if you fail to blub, swoon, and / or oscillate wildly to new
BMX Bandits songs such as Lost Girl, The Audition, Rays of Golden, and I
Could Fall In Love, you are devoid of ears, heart, soul, and any
capacity for human warmth whatsoever. As California favoured us with
Brian Wilson, so Lanarkshire gave us Duglas Stewart . . .
''Our records are always about my personal hang-ups and joys, and the
last LP was about how messed-up I was feeling,'' Duglas tells me with a
typical hangdog air.
''Oddly, as we started making the new album, everything was good and
positive. I was getting married and about to become a father. But while
I ended up with a beautiful daughter, the rest of my life fell apart.''
No prying from me on this one. Just make sure you hear the album, and
you'll be moved to shed bittersweet tears of empathy.
Proffering a supportive hankie and moving right along, I observe that
Duglas is the only surviving original BMX Bandit, other founders having
gone on to Teenage Fanclub, the Soup Dragons, and Superstar, thence to
Eugenius. How does Duglas feel he's changed?
''In early interviews I felt I had to justify what I was doing with
the band, that spoken explanations could make the music more valid. Yet
I think what's wrong with a lot of music now is that it's based solely
on its makers' ability to give good copy; if you can psycho-analyse
yourself in print and examine all your motives, and wear eye-liner and
swear a lot and live what's meant to be the rock lifestyle, you must be
good.
''And, of course, writing good songs is the real thing that counts.
All I know about Carole King, for instance, is that she's divorced. You
don't know why Shakespeare wrote Macbeth or Romeo and Juliet, you just
know the work. So the fact of me having anything clever to say about the
BMX Bandits is unimportant.
''Brian Wilson's music talks to people in ways a clever thesis never
could. For the best musicians, music is the best way, or maybe the only
way for them to communicate.
''Or as my dad once said to me when I was a child: 'All Jaffa Cakes
are biscuits . . . but not all biscuits are Jaffa Cakes.' I know now
that that makes sense. Or maybe it doesn't. But jings, if there's any
one line that sums up our new LP . . . ''
You will be relieved to learn that this utterance is delivered with
Duglas's customary laughter. He retains his appreciation of the absurd
and his faith in the innocent, all-conquering power of pop to bring
people together. Invest in the BMX Bandits and you'll become a believer.
HITHERTO best known to the less eagle-eared as joint leader of
Australia's long extinct primal punkers the Saints, the iconoclastic Ed
Kuepper now has a solo career that encompasses eight brooding albums.
Next Tuesday he appears at Glasgow's King Tut's, and you owe it to
yourself to be there.
Check out Serene Machine or the compilation The Butterfly Net, and
you'll know why.
ACE wordsmith Russell Leadbetter is penning a tome entitled You Don't
Have To Be In Harlem about Glasgow's dearly-departed rock venue, the
Apollo Theatre. And he needs your help, in the form of anecdotal
memoires. Dispatch them to him soonliest at his regular place of work,
the Evening Times, 195 Albion Street, Glasgow G1 1QP.

<TEXT>
THE Prime Minister yesterday condemned neo-Nazi group Combat 18 as
''repellent'' and promised tough police action to curb its activities.
Mr Major joined at Commons Question Time with Labour's Greville
Janner, MP for Leicester West, in accusing the organisation's members of
being ''thugs''.
In a fierce denunciation of the far-right group, the Prime Minister
said: ''The literature they circulate is utterly disgusting and there
can be no place for their type of politics in the UK.''
He was responding after Mr Janner, a former member of the Board of
Deputies of British Jews, asked: ''As we approach the 50th anniversary
of the liberation of the Belsen concentration camp by British troops,
will you express what I am sure is the wish of us all, that there will
never be such a tragedy again?''
The MP urged the Prime Minister to consider ''whether we should not
deal rather better with Hitler's heirs in our own country -- not least
the thugs of Combat 18 and their ilk who have been sending to Asians in
the city of Leicester and elsewhere, racist, threatening and abusive
cards and razor blades through the post''.
Mr Janner demanded: ''Will you ensure the police have both the
resources and the determination to deal with these awful people?''
Mr Major replied: ''I agree without qualification with you about that.
Combat 18 are a repellent organisation.''
He said that the Criminal Justice Act had introduced a new offence of
intentional harasssment, which he hoped would give the police ''more
powers to deal with serious racial harassment''.
The distribution of racially inflammatory material was being made an
arrestable offence, he added.
''But of course the best reassurance we can give to victims is the one
you touched on -- that is to help the police to ensure that these people
are caught and punished for their crimes.''

TIME was when both these groups tended to paint themselves into
corners by being overly aware of the numbing ridiculousness which can
swamp serious live rock 'n' roll entities who take being serious live
rock 'n' roll entities too seriously. There would, for instance, be
occasions when Teenage Fanclub shows were too amiably shambolic to
benefit anyone; when the Pastels' apologetic unwillingness to blow their
own trumpets could be mistaken for a lack of resolution.
On Wednesday's evidence, this is no longer the case, and we should all
rejoice. While the human components of both bands remain
self-deprecatingly human-sized, their music rocks out in tight, bold,
confident fashion.
Thus the Pastels' bid to fashion a Spectoresque wall of sound from two
plastic whirly-tubes fails only because at the same time they're
cranking out a mighty, melodic, and convincing racket, much aided by a
miniature Jurgen Klinsmann -- new recruit Jonathan Kilgour -- on rhythm
guitar. Check out the worlds of possibility in the Pastels' current
single, Worlds of Possibility.
As for Teenage Fanclub, their forthcoming LP, Grand Prix, is a
stunner, as Wednesday's exhilarating samples underlined. Meshing
guitars; winsome-but-gutsy vocals; fresh tunes; neat songs. Pogo-ing
front-stage throngs flailing themselves into a polite smush-frenzy;
knots of adoring Japanese adolescents nodding their heads to the blessed
beat and looking rapt. Beatles; Byrds; Teenage Fanclub.
And they only false-started one song, their last. And Norman Blake
managed a successful whistling solo. ''We're off to practise more,'' he
said in conclusion. No need. Everything's perfect. Seriously.

ARE you sitting comfortably? The Orb's Happy Happy Joy Joy ride will
begin. Unfortunately I wasn't. And to be honest, I wasn't sure exactly
when it did.
The Orb are a fantastic . . . er, experience, to have in your
living-room with a few friends, a few drinks, and maybe a pizza. Lie
back and enjoy the sounds and then forget about them. Instantly. But
Barrowland is impossible to fill with your mates, and they don't sell
pizza. Thank Ren and Stimpy there's a bar.
Underneath the harsh, stabbing bleeps is an elegant but strange and
mystifying float into ambience that creates a mood of subconscious human
bonding. But how does one enjoy ambient music in a concert hall?
Get a hat (four sizes too big), a comfortable pair of gutties, and a
temporary removal of all brain matter. Gone, it seems, are the days of
rock/pop star admiration. Does anyone stand at the stage door for a
glimpse or autograph after the gig? Do they collect posters of their
idol? Not in this game. The crouched, sensible few lining Barrowland's
walls wished they had had a carpet and a pizza, I bet.
However, if one person left having discovered that life is just a
dream and we are all the imagination of ourselves ([CPYR] Bill Hicks,
1961-1994), the Orb should be chuffed they've done their job. And
believe me, there should have been a few.
But what are they all about? Get hold of one of those pre-birth,
womb-type, dolphin-music tape thingies they give expectant mothers;
that's about the size of it. Don't agree? Maybe I've missed the point,
but, hey, I can live with that.

SWEEPING changes to the way in which the Scottish court system works
were announced by the Government yesterday.
Scottish Secretary Ian Lang announced that the Scottish Court Service
would become an executive agency under the Next Steps initiative from
April 3.
He said he would remain accountable to Parliament for the activities
of the Scottish Court Service, but he was delegating to the chief
executive full managerial authority for the agency and for its day to
day operation.
Mr Lang has set a series of targets for the new agency, the main one
being that ''no cases should fall as a result of the statutory time
limits being breached.''
He wants an 80% target of trials coming to court, and has set new
targets for quality of service.
Staff, accommodation and administratitve costs must be kept within a
strict limit of #1060 per court sitting day.
Mr Lang said he was was arranging for copies of the framework document
on the changes to be placed in the libraries of the House.

ONE of the best events of last year's Edinburgh International Festival
happened off the main stages. It was a Show 'n' Share session where
groups of local pupils let parents and organisers see what even a brief
exposure to the Mark Morris dance experience had produced.
The results of the workshops taken by Morris and his dancers were
absolutely stunning. Whether the groups had choreographed their own
pieces or rehearsed moves from Morris's own work, there was a strong
sense that they had got inside the skin of what dance-making was all
about.
Just as the Mark Morris Dance Group had struck up a special
relationship with Festival audiences -- after appearing in three
successive seasons, the cry was still for more -- so it seemed that
something just as special had started to take hold out in the wider
community.
At which point project sponsors ScottishPower decided they, too,
wanted more. And so, in between this year's Festival dates -- there are
two separate programmes -- Morris and his team will again run an
outreach scheme involving hundreds of local participants.
Anyone expecting to be told what to do is in for a big surprise. But
then, Morris wants them to taste a little of what it's like in real
life, where ideas have to be licked into shape against the clock,
against budgets, against the days when the muse has hitched a ride out
of town. Except, in real life, he has to come up with the finished
product -- they don't.

THE Government is intent on introducing new powers to call out
volunteer Servicemen and women for peacekeeping, humanitarian, and
disaster relief operations Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind announced
yesterday.
At the same time, steps will be taken to make it easier for civilians
to be put into uniform.
The proposals announced yesterday are a major reform of the law on the
possible call out of reservists and will affect thousands of part-time
soldiers throughout the country.
Mr Rifkind agreed yesterday that the new powers would be part of the
Front Line First policy of the Government. Nevertheless, he insisted it
would not lead to any further cuts within the armed forces.
The proposed legislation envisages the deployment of reservists in the
widest possible range of operations from all-out war to assisting in UN
humanitarian efforts.
It will be the first major change in legislation for reservists in
almost 30 years.
Under the proposals -- contained in a document entitled Strength in
Reserve -- 53 Acts of Parliament, stretching over three centuries, will
be amalgamated.
It will become easier for the military to call out reservists not only
in times of war, but to put into uniform civilians whose particular
expertise might be required at any time the military might choose.
Mr Rifkind said: ''We are very, very enthusiastic about seeing our
reserve forces not simply as an add-on to the regular forces but as an
integral part of the armed forces of the UK.
''Our reservists have very special skills and tremendous enthusiasm to
use those skills for the benefit of their country.''
A draft Bill was published yesterday. However, Mr Rifkind made it
clear he anticipated that following a period of consultation, proposed
new legislation was likely to be included in the Queen's Speech for the
next Parliament.
Two new categories of reserve are envisaged:
* High Readiness Reserves, with a strength of up to 5,000, covering
those with specialist skills such as those employed in medicine and
those with language qualifications.
* Sponsored Reserves will include those with skills enabling them to
take over duties currently carried out by regular forces not engaged
directly in front-line fighting -- that could be in communications, or
those who know how to service an aircraft engine.
The draft Bill covers problems experienced in the Gulf War which
limited the call-out of reservists.
Sponsored reserves, employed by either the Ministry of Defence or by
defence contractors, will have an obligation in their contract of
employment to don uniform on behalf of the country.
Measures will be included to compensate ''volunteers'' for a potential
loss in earnings, and the company for the loss of a key employee.
Mr Rifkind insisted yesterday that this would go ahead on an entirely
voluntary basis.
However, it was made clear last night that major problems remain
unresolved.
Not the least of those are the private insurance and company pension
rights of those who might have to go into a war situation.
The new legislation met with a mixed response from long-standing
reservists.
''As a single man, it is a wonderful opportunity to put your training
into practice,'' said Royal Marines Reserve Captain Gavin Richards, 35,
a London insurance broker.
''But as a married man with two children and commitments, you look at
it differently.''
Corporal Rowena Fitter, a City analyst from Bromley, Kent, said: ''You
join the TA with the idea you are doing something worthwhile and that
you might be able to put your training into practice. But when push
comes to shove I'm not so sure.''
Training for senior officers in the armed forces is to be concentrated
at a Joint Service Command and Staff College, Camberley, Surrey, Armed
Forces Minister Nicholas Soames confirmed last night.
He announced in a Commons written reply that he was standing by the
original proposal in the Front Line First review of Britain's forces
that the Camberley was the best site for the college.
It means the closure of the colleges at Bracknell, Berkshire; and
Greenwich, south east London.

NEARLY but not quite. That was the story last night at the Royal SNO,
where the band was conducted for the first time by Czech-born Martin
Turnovsky. A rather effete character on the stand, Turnovsky seems to
know what he wants but is erratic in getting the orchestra to produce it
consistently -- quite a lot of untidiness marked the performances.
And none of them quite hit the mark. Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony, for
example was un-epic; it was a small-scale emotional performance and
didn't touch the exposed nerve of this most highly-charged of works. A
little precious, Turnovsky seemed at home in the grace of the second
movement, but didn't get under the skin of the piece. Febrile it wasn't.
Rachmaninov's Second Piano Concerto was another one. With Korean
pianist Seung-Un Ha (another debut with the orchestra) it was extremely
pleasant, but -- again -- on the small scale. This was a performance
with poetry rather than passion, poise instead of power.
A light-fingered pianist, Seung-Un Ha played the concerto in a style
akin to chamber music rather than the warhorse it is. Her speeds were
sedate, lacking urgency and the crucial rush at high moments (and she
didn't listen closely enough to the solos by the band).
Alasdair Nicolson's prize-winning Tree of Strings (which I haven't
heard before) also seemed a bit undercharacterised. A wee piece with a
big canvas, this music sets haunting, poignant Scots melodies in a
landscape hewn out of granite. It should be enormously atmospheric but
seemed expressively undernourished. Big turnout. Same show tonight in
Edinburgh.

HAROLD PINTER'S devastating dissection of a love affair is all the
more emotionally redolent for being played out in reverse; as an illicit
passion between a woman and her husband's best friend is traced back
through its various phases -- final disenchantment from initial rapture
-- the sense of doom is paradoxically more poignant. David Fielding's
direction and design illuminates this fully, with a stark set and harsh,
fluorescent lighting.
The eternal triangle take their places within a constrictive circle,
acting out the brittle dialogues on a revolving dias set within the
stage floor. It is a device which is eminently suitable for the Circle
Studio space -- affording the audience a panoramic viewpoint of the
intense interactions -- and which, with its fluctuating
clockwork/anti-clockwork passage, reinforces the sense of zigzagging
time.
Unfortunately, for once, the stylistic vision somewhat exceeded the
Citizens' technical capabilities; an opening scene involving Emma
(Amanda Elwes) and her lover Jerry (Gerrard McArthur) was disrupted by
the near-parodic shriekings of set machinery, inducing an outbreak of
sniggers among the audience while a terse conversation was played out.
Disrupted but not destroyed. Elwes and McArthur kept their cool and
kept us enthralled. The machinery eventually behaved itself, although
the hysteria it at first induced found expression as the audience,
disturbingly, laughed loudly when Emma's husband Robert (Michael Jenn)
informed Jerry that he beat his wife because ''I just felt like giving
her a good bashing''.
This incredible reaction belied the pain portrayed for, despite the
wry humour of much of the script, Pinter depicts a horrible and haunting
hollowness of heart -- one which this splendid cast fully realised.

In an uncompromising encyclical on the sanctity of life, the Pope lays
the groundwork for his eventual successor. Anne Simpson reports on its
determined terms.
IGNORING the vicious damp rising off the Tiber, crowds jammed St
Peter's Square last Wednesday for the customary mid-week audience with
the Pope. But the very numbers on this occasion signified something
unusual for the pilgrim season does not generally begin until Palm
Sunday.
For those who keep a tally of such things here, indeed, was a record:
among the joyful throng there were 12,000 Polish visitors alone, each of
them, like everyone else hoping to receive a personal benediction from
John Paul as, over hours, he toured the square in his sanctified jeep.
Then, next day, there came a sterner vision of reality with the
publication of Evangelium Vitae, the 11th and most uncompromising
encyclical on the sanctity of life from that most paradoxical of
leaders, a star-turn disciplinarian.
Only naivety might have prompted some liberal Roman Catholics to think
this proclamation might offer just a whisper of doctrinal flexibility.
At the age of 74 the Pope remains true to his own Polish orthodoxy, and
nothing witnessed during his extraordinary voyages as a pastor of the
world has shifted his opposition to birth control, abortion and
euthanasia.
But there is in this long and eloquent letter, threaded on every page
with biblical precedence, a message running parallel in some respects to
the concerns of many now worried by the intolerance of our market-driven
quest for profit and efficiency at the more vulnerable's expense:
''It is possible to speak in a certain sense of a war of the powerful
against the weak: a life which would require greater acceptance, love
and care if considered useless . . . A person who because of illness,
handicap or, more simply, just by existing, compromises the well being
or life-style of those who are more favoured tends to be looked upon as
an enemy to be resisted, or eliminated. In this way a kind of
'conspiracy against life' is unleashed.''
As much as any teaching against the medical means of ending life this
is the voice of the Pope's moral authority speaking out against those
other policies which elevate greed to an ethical crusade and seek to
justify long-term unemployment and poverty for some as for the greater
good.
But in describing our ''culture of death'' John Paul reserves his
strongest attacks for those governments and doctors who provide a
climate where ''choices once unanimously considered criminal and
rejected by the common moral sense are gradually becoming socially
acceptable . . . In this way the very nature of the medical profession
is distorted and contradicted and the dignity of those who practise it,
distorted.
At times the Pope's line on birth control seems more understanding
than in the past: ''It may be that many people use contraception with
the view to excluding the subsequent temptation of abortion.'' But this
mentality he argues, can strengthen that very temptation when an
unwanted life is conceived. ''Abortion willed as an end or as a means
always constitutes a grave moral disorder.''
His warnings against in-vitro fertilisation are re-emphasised and on
pre-natal diagnosis he stresses that there is no moral objection when
such procedure is carried out to identify any needed medical treatment
to safeguard the child in the womb but, familiarly he condemns its
practice for the purposes of eugenic abortion and ''therapeutic
interventions''.
And on euthanasia he writes: ''When death is clearly imminent and
inevitable one can in conscience refuse forms of treatment that would
only secure a precarious and burdensome prolongation of life so long as
the moral care due to the sick person is not interrupted.''
In expressing such views, particularly on abortion the Pope has always
been careful condemn any violence used by others as support, but the
problem of his intransigence on certain social issues feeding aberrant
fundamentalism will not be lessened by Evangelium Vitae.
However, on the subject of capital punishment John Paul emerges as a
progressive: ''Among the signs of hope . . . there is evidence of a
growing public opposition to the death penalty, even when such a penalty
is seen as a 'legitimate defence'. Modern society in fact has the means
of effectively suppressing crime by rendering criminals harmless without
definitively denying them the chance to reform . . . as a result of
steady improvements in the organisation of the penal system, such cases
are very rare.''
The Pope's teaching here is particularly significant because this is a
man who has known the fury of a would-be assassin's bullets.
Despite its general traditionalist tone the letter does contain some
unexpected elements. Perhaps for the first time publicly John Paul
indicates a fraction of sympathy for women who have undergone abortion.
''The Church is aware of the many factors which may have influenced your
decision, and she does not doubt that in many cases it was a painful and
shattering decision . . .''
This, in fact, is the second time in the past few months that the Pope
has made specific reference to women. During his Australian tour in
January he preached that: ''The Church stands firmly against every form
of discrimination which in any way compromises the equal dignity of
women and women.''
Yet almost in the same breath he urged women to accept that their true
role in society was motherhood, and it remains beyond his comprehension
that birth control, especially in the developing world, is vital to the
urgent enhancement of women's lives. And in this encyclical there is
also a restating that even where rape has occurred, any subsequent
pregnancy should be inviolate.''
Liberal Catholics, whose numbers are increasing, will hardly change
their thinking because of this latest tract, for they have long resolved
any impulse to be driven back into a ghetto of guilt by their
independent stance. But what the letter does is set in stone what we
already knew of Karol Wojtyla.
''The encyclical lays the negative groundwork for the next Vicar of
Rome,'' says one Vatican historian, ''and whoever that is he will find
it very difficult to wriggle free from this one.'' But it remains one of
Jonn Paul's peculiarities that, in an age forlornly lacking leadership,
he has never been afraid to jeopardise his popularity by becoming a
brake on progressive thinking. And next Sunday the thousands will be out
again in St Peter's Square, to applaud the star-turn disciplinarian, the
Pope of crowds.

Alan MacDermid examines the case of a Californian boy who cast off HIV
infection.
ACOMMON reaction to the news that a child in California has shaken off
the Aids virus he caught at birth from his mother is likely to be:
''Find out what he's on, and I'll have some.''
Scientists the world over will be clamouring to know what biological
quirk came between this five-year-old boy and the normally inexorable
course of the disease, and what lessons they can draw in their quest for
a vaccine or cure.
The fact remains that babies can and do inherit HIV maternally -- 24
such cases have been recorded in Scotland to date, five of whom have
died, so the risk remains if a pregnant woman has HIV.
What makes the California child's case so exciting is that he may in
fact be far from unique. All children born to HIV-infected mothers will
inherit her antibodies -- in the same way that they inherit antibodies
to measles, chicken-pox or any other infection she has had -- but only
15%-20% go on to develop the infection itself. If the child is simply
carrying the antibodies, these will fade from its system in about 18
months.
This course is normally charted using one of the standard HIV-antibody
tests which are the routine way of determining infection in adults.
However the California baby was tested twice -- 19 days and 51 days
after birth -- using a more specific test, which detects the virus
itself rather than just the antibody.
The tests proved conclusively that the boy was infected for at least a
month during the first two months of his life -- it seemed clear that
the infant was destined to be an Aids baby.
But the child never got sick. On his first birthday he was given a
standard Aids blood test which came out normal -- as did the more
sophisticated test for the virus.
Dr Yvonne Bryson, a pediatrician and Aids specialist at the University
of California, Los Angeles, Medical School, said she believed it was the
first carefully documented case of someone casting off all signs of
infection.
''It's like a miracle to me and a miracle to his mother. It's every
mother's dream that their child won't be infected,'' said Dr Bryson, who
with her colleagues is studying the boy's immune system for clues that
could be used to stop Aids infections in others.
But how many other babies -- who were presumed to have simply
inherited maternal antibodies and shaken them off -- would in fact have
been shown to be infected with the virus if the specific test had been
employed?
Similar cases have been reported in the past but were dismissed as
laboratory errors. Now Pat Tookey, of the UK Surveillance Study on HIV
in Pregnancy, says that some babies probably have been overlooked as
infected and gone on to beat the virus.
''The American case is unusual in that the child was given the more
sensitive test in the first place. Most cases are not looked at in as
much detail,'' she said.
However, she pointed out, most children in the past who were proved to
have the virus had shown other signs of illness as well as being
antibody positive. So the American case, while not necessarily unique,
is probably still relatively rare. But it comes on the heels of other
evidence that HIV can be beaten by the human immune system.
Doctors in Edinburgh were among the first to discover that some babies
had raised counts of Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes reactive to HIV which later
disappeared, indicating transient exposure to the virus.
More recently studies of women prostitutes in the Gambia carried out
by the UK Medical Research Council showed that they, too, had raised CTL
counts but persistently tested HIV-negative, even after repeated
exposure to the virus.
These ''killer'' T-cells are part of the immune system's early warning
system which stimulates the production of antibodies to fight infection.
In the case of HIV, these antibodies are ineffective against HIV once it
has taken hold, but the Gambian evidence suggests that the killer
lymphocytes themselves wiped out the invading virus.
Now seems possible that foetuses successfully fight off the disease
while in the womb or shortly after birth. Understanding how babies can
shed the infection -- either because of some characteristic of the virus
or because of the way foetuses and newborns react to it ''could have
profound implications for HIV therapy and vaccine development,'' say Dr
Bryson and her colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Professor Jim Neil, one of the team engaged in the search for an HIV
vaccine at Glasgow University Veterinary School, said yesterday's news
was encouraging, but admitted they still had a mountain to climb before
an effective vaccine or therapy became available.
''It remains to be seen how much can be learned from one individual;
there may be a genetic difference.''
Laboratory work at the Vet School has produced some limited success
with inactivated viruses. Now they are looking at ways of cloning
harmless viral DNA which can be injected into muscle to produce an
immune response. But finding an effective vaccine or therapy is still a
tall order, said Professor Neil.

WAS it not about time politicians and the media stopped selling
Britain short, asked Sir Tim Renton (Mid Sussex -- Con.) It was one of
those searching questions often directed at Prime Ministers by someone
from their own side.
Mr Major agreed. Like Sir Tim, he had attended the conference Britain
and the World, the previous day, in which sundry Britons said how
marvellous we were and, even more embarrassingly, some foreigners did as
well. It was the brainchild of the Foreign Office which, on rather
slender evidence, tends to assume that it is one of the good things for
which Britain is most famous.
The Prince of Wales stated: ''We are all suffering from a lack of
self-confidence,'' which may be true in HRH's case but shows that he can
pay little attention when politicians are speaking to him.
Mr Willie McKelvey (Kilmarnock and Loudoun -- Lab.) and his leader,
for whom he paved the way, were more concerned that the Government was
selling those priceless national assets, the nurses, short.
This offered Mr Major the opportunity to sell Mr Blair short by
conspicuously failing to answer the same question three times. Would it
not be unfair, asked the Leader of the Opposition, if a substantial body
of nurses failed to get the 3% pay rise which others got by topping up
the 1% national award with local pay bargaining.
''Nobody wishes to be unfair to the nurses or anybody else in the
NHS,'' Mr Major said. An independent pay review body had recommended the
form of the settlement.
But had not the Government leaned on the pay body to lay stress on
local pay bargaining and would it not be unfair if a substantial body of
nurses? . . .
''We accepted the pay board's recommendation in full,'' responded Mr
Major, not coming within a bargepole's distance of fairness. The
majority of local offers being made took nurses to 3% or even more.
But what about the nurses who didn't get that, persisted Mr Blair.
Wouldn't they feel a sense of injustice. Looking well away from the
question, Mr Major said the review board had spoken; the Government had
accepted its recommendation; the nurses had welcomed the board when it
was set up; the Tories had set it up, not Labour; and Labour when in
Government had actually cut nurses pay by 3%.
However, getting carried away by the rightness of the Government's
case, he said: ''It is scrupulously fair.'' A view with which a nurse
1[1/2]% worse off say, than her comparable collegue in another part of
the country, may not entirely agree.
The next bit of possibly selling short featured Canada. Mrs Anne
Winterton (Congleton -- Con.) the better half of the formidable maverick
Winterton duo -- (Nicholas sits for Macclesfield) -- sought an insurance
that HMG would not sell the Canadians short at the behest of Spain
(hiss) or the EU.
Mr Major earlier had got a fervent cheer for saying that the Canadians
were ''quite right to take a tough line on enforcement.'' However, (a
Foreign Office man had obviously made it back from the conference to
draft this bit), they shouldn't harm their case by getting too tough.
This last bit seemed to worry Mrs Winterton, who quoted Lord Tebbit's
dictum that loyalty was a question of who you cheered for at a cricket
match. Would Mr Major cheer enthusiastically for Canada ''in their
forthcoming fixture against Spain?''
Helped out by the allusion, Mr Major said he thought Canada had
actually beaten England at cricket in 1868 or 1874. The Canadians might
well be able to repeat that performance while the English cricket team
continues to suffer from what the Prince called ''a lack of
self-confidence.'' Alternatively, they could challenge the Spanish to a
cricket match to settle their dispute, although if the Dons play cricket
like they fish they probably would sweep to victory by tampering with
the seam and bribing the umpires.
Mr Major repeated his first answer but, remembering that cheer,
dropped the remark about Canada not getting too tough. Quite rightly so.
If we are lacking self-confidence, there is no need to try and pass the
disease on to robuster neighbours.

A LABOUR MP yesterday condemned the practice of locking up children in
adult prisons in Scotland because of a shortage of places in secure
units for juveniles.
Mr John McFall, Labour's Scottish Home Affairs spokesman, raised the
issue at the Commons after The Herald reported yesterday that a
15-year-old schoolboy had spent a night in Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow
and a 14-year-old boy had been locked up in Porterfield Prison,
Inverness.
Mr McFall, who is MP for Dumbarton, said last night that the interests
of children were not being served by sending them to prisons which were
for the most hardened criminals.
He said: ''We will be putting pressure on the Government to ensure
that it does not occur again.''
However, a spokesman for the Scottish Prisons Service said last night
that in 1993 -- the most recent figures available -- 21 children were
kept in custody in adult prisons in Scotland.
The average time spent in jail, either on remand or awaiting reports,
was 24 days.
Courts could order young people aged 14 or over to be kept in secure
accommodation under what were known as ''unruly certificates''.
If no secure local authority place was available, the only alternative
was adult prison, he said..
Mr McFall commented: ''This is an inexplicably high number and long
time, and I will be pressing the Minister when he replies to me.''

TORY MP Bill Walker has received a legal opinion which suggests legal
review in the Court of Session could save sleeper services on the West
Highland line. He has passed it to Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney
and recommended that it be considered by Department of Transport
lawyers.
The opinion rates the chances of success as reasonable. ''The courts
would have regard to the severity of the impact of the proposed closure
on the West Highlands, and would set that consideration against the
manifestly inadequate replacement service proposed as a mere device by
ScotRail, '' the Tayside North MP said.
The opinion was obtained by constituents of Mr Walker's in Rannoch. It
says a petition for judicial review would incur relatively low expenses
and take no more than a day in court.
NATIONAL Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell last night clashed with
the Opposition over the future of the London-Fort William sleeper.
Mr Dorrell said: ''The key question surely is not whether it is
absolutely essential indefinitely into the future to continue to provide
a sleeper service which almost nobody uses.
''The key question is how you ensure that those who want to travel
from London to the north of Scotland do so at maximum convenience.
''The evidence is that there aren't enough users of that service for
it to be a reasonable economic proposition to continue to provide it.''
Shadow National Heritage Secretary Chris Smith said that the Fort
William sleeper service was one of the great railway journeys of the
world.
Mr Smith said: ''If you try to book between now and the end of May,
there is hardly a place left.
''If it had been marketed properly and thoroughly over the last five
or 10 years, more people would have been using it and we would have been
able to keep a very valuable service.''

Catherine Brown
reports on ideas that go down well in the competitive business of food
and drink
TURTLES and parachutes may not appear to have much in common. Unless,
of course, you happen to be explaining the reason why your business of
selling meals has soared from nothing to a turnover of #8m in 16 years.
You need both the nerve of the turtle, who sticks his neck out, plus
the guts of the parachuter, who takes the big leap into the unknown.
Chris Robinson, managing director of Wheatsheaf Catering and chairman of
Heart of Midlothian Football Club, has both.
The tattered poster of the turtle on his office wall, given to him by
his wife 16 years ago, reminds him to ''Behold the turtle who makes
progress only when he sticks his neck out . . .''
He has parachute-jumped from a plane just once, as a dare. Starting
his own business produced the same kind of terror.
He is describing his ''Success in the Food and Drink Industry'' at a
Business Masterclass run by Dunbartonshire Enterprise.
For him it all began sitting across the desk from the headmistress of
an Edinburgh private school. Robinson, with no track record in the
contract-catering business, managed to persuade her that he could solve
her catering problems. It was his first break.
Buying the Wheatsheaf bakery business to supply bread for his now
growing number of contracts expanded his horizons further. But it was
not until after the Glasgow Garden Festival in 1987 that he felt
confident enough to stick his neck out once again.
For the best part of 10 years he had been running, what he describes
as a ''job-shop operation'', responding to the needs of outside catering
and banqueting. It was during the Garden Festival he gained a reputation
and saw the opportunity of moving into more permanent prestige contracts
like Edinburgh Castle, Stirling Castle, Hopetoun House, Culzean Castle,
The Discovery at Dundee as well as many sports and leisure centres.
The next move occurred last year with Hearts. When he stops feeling
terrified, he has a laugh at the comments of sports journalists who
wonder how this caterer can possibly run a football club when he knows
nothing about football.
That may be true, but as he points out: ''I do know about customer
care. I do know what the spectators are not getting at the moment. And I
do know that they have been very badly treated in the past.''
Robinson's success has not been quick and easy. Instant coffee, he
points out, is not usually as good as something which has taken a bit
longer to brew.
Leo Barclay, successful curer of Rannoch Smoked Venison, can agree
with that sentiment. It has taken him eight years to build up his
business since he first stuck his neck out and knocked on the Harrods
food buyer's door with his samples of smoked venison.
He had been snowed-in for several weeks, and with surplus venison in
the larder, decided to experiment with the ancient salting and smoking
methods of preservation.
His friends and relatives who had tasted it thought it was wonderful.
Fortunately the Harrods buyer was also impressed, though she sent him
home with many suggestions about improving his packaging and
presentation. They became his first customer.
Last year the traditional smoked salmon at the Lord Mayor's Banquet at
the Guildhall was replaced by Rannoch Smoked Venison. Three
supermarkets, Safeway, Waitrose and Sainsbury, now stock it in selected
stores, also many specialist shops.
While Robinson likes to look after people, Barclay is passionate about
Scotland's wild natural resources. The Scottish hills contain some of
the most distinctive and delicious meat in Europe: free-range, lean and
in plentiful supply; 40,000 head have to be shot each year and it is a
tragedy, he says, that so much of it is still exported to Germany -- a
trade which developed after the war, when Germans cottoned-on to the
fact that this superb meat was not only available and cheap, but also
totally ignored by the Scots.
Barclay and his wife and business partner, Sara, own a small hill farm
at the head of Loch Rannoch and until he was 50, farming had been his
career. The snowed-in episode coincided with a crisis on the farm when
two staff were going to be laid off.
He saw the smoking business as not only a way of using valuable
natural resources, but also a means of sustaining the life of a remote
local community. The smokery now employs nine people and all his farm
cottages are being used as homes for employees rather than holiday
cottages.
Keeping the life of rural Scotland alive has also been part of the
drive behind Euan Shand's success in the whisky industry. With his
father a distillery manager in Aberdeenshire he had always dreamt of
owning his own company.
The Bennachie Scotch Whisky Company is not quite three years old but
already its three brands, Bennachie, Black Jock, Pot Lid and
Murrayfield, have earned the company an International Wine and Spirit
bronze certificate.
Shand has been close to the whisky business all his life but only for
the past three years running his own company. He has just stepped off a
plane from the Far East, jet-lagged but still capable of sticking his
neck out. At the lunch after the Masterclass he wonders if the two
Highland glens shouldn't get together. How about a special pack of
Bennachie whisky and Rannoch Smoked venison?

You may only be here for the beer,
but the label can be the most
important choice. Anvar Khan
on why it's hip to go for certain hops
IN A West End piano bar, secreted away in Glasgow's Grosvenor Stakis
Hotel, the various beer prices are displayed on a framed menu. A
moustachioed, crumpled, fag-smoking geezer with a wimp of a wallet
shuffles round the bar, a Rodolfo Marin ducking and diving against Frank
Bruno. He's no heavyweight, there's no contest. It takes him 65 seconds
to abandon the fight and order a bottle of Becks.
In pubs all over the country it's costing more to drink less. Fashion
panders to wealth, not poverty, and no more so than in the Battle Of The
Bottled Beer. But even the poor want to take it by the neck.
In truth, a 330ml bottle of beer is proportionately more expensive
than a 500ml pint of the same product. However, sales of bottled beer
remain astronomically high.
Scottish and Newcastle Breweries shift 250-300 tonnes of beer a day,
and 20% is bottled. From the top, the most popular bottles are Becks,
Bud, McEwan's Export, Carlsberg Special, Holsten Pils, McEwan's 80 and
90 Shilling, Coors, Sol, Grolsch, Labatts, Red Stripe, and Tennents
Stout. Millers Lite, which S &amp; N started to distribute only a few months
ago, is not as popular as Becks but is just as expensive, sold by the
crate at the same price.
There is no real rivalry between pint and bottle drinkers; they are
two separate social groups. The former want volume of product; the
latter are similar to the Gucci persons who spend a phenomenal amount of
money on inkwells of parfum. Drinking culture has graduated to the
realms of ''less is more'' consumption. The profit margins for
retailers, therefore, are huge.
A brewery sells one case (24 bottles) of Becks to a pub for an average
#16 -- 63p per bottle. The average price for a bottle of the said
product in any pub, as illustrated by the table, is #2. In other words,
to walk into a bar and order a bottle is to hand over 300% clear profit.
The basis for the popularity of bottled beer, has, ironically, more to
do with the actions of the moral guardians of Glasgow than any promotion
on the part of the brewers. When bottled beer first appeared in Scottish
gantries four or five years ago, the City Chambers hit outrage mode.
In 1993, Glasgow licensing chiefs dropped a proposed ban on the sale
of bottled beers over the counter in discos. Disgusted council bosses
claimed that drinking the foaming liquid straight from the bottle was
unhygienic and that the fancy bottles were potential weapons.
Various concerned sources had apparently taken it upon themselves to
undertake controlled experiments in violence. They arrived at the
conclusion that the propulsion of a bottle was much more dangerous than
a glass. Indeed, the debate then moved on to which entity was safer when
splintered into threatening pieces.
From that point, the designer beer bottle became inextricably linked
with the city fathers' unwelcome attempts to restrict the social life of
the Saturday night reveller. Weekend punters don't want to compromise
fun for safety. Bottled beer suddenly had more balls.
''It's not cool to drink from a pint, but it's cool to drink from a
bottle,'' says Alex Borland, assistant manager of Caskies, Glasgow. Why?
''Posing,'' he says.
Patricia Dickie, manageress of city bar Nico's, agrees that bottles of
beer are popular, but even as punters cool towards designer labels it
hasn't encouraged them to reach for a cheaper pint.
''Nowadays,'' she says, crushing the hopes of the city's licensing
chiefs, ''it's old fashioned to flaunt a bottle, so you find that most
people are asking for a glass with it.''
The high price of Becks, for example, is justified by its journey and
disposability. It is brewed in Bremen, Germany, shipped to Felixstowe,
then driven up to Edinburgh. The bottles are non-returnable, so they
can't be re-delivered to the breweries. But in the Battle of the Bottled
Beer, it's really the punter who's the traitor.
''There are more than 80 bottled beers available to order in Threshers
in Scotland,'' says David Howse, communications manager of the UK
off-sales firm. ''There's been a culture change, the country's become
more internationalist. Bottled beers have become almost parallel to
wine. People want to try different brands. Those who are most
responsible for the promotions on bottled beer are the customer.''
He admits: ''The public has a fanatical interest in bottled beer, and
we use these products as tools to attract customers into the shops.''
Another new market is the growing number of people who drink at home.
Oddbins off-sales, for example, is investigating the possibilities of
selling premium-quality bottled beers -- specialist flavours from
Belgium -- that are allegedly far superior to draught. But the average
price of a bottle of beer in an ''offie'' is #1.5p. The outlet is still
making nearly 100% profit.
Dave Smith, manager of the Horseshoe Bar in Drury Street in the city
centre, agrees that drinking from a bottle is daft. He says the
production of a bottle costs more than the creation of the content.
''It depends what you want to be seen drinking. The trendies pay more
money for premium beers because they want everyone to see the label.
It's a status symbol.''
The public who pay three times the price for a Becks are willing
compliants in the Battle of the Bottled Beer.
''It's the exact same product from the bottle or the font,'' shrugs
Dave.

JOBCENTRES are being asked to place a record 1.85 million unemployed
people in work next year, Employment Secretary Michael Portillo
announced last night.
He disclosed the 1995-96 performance targets for the Employment
Service in a Commons written reply.
In an accompanying statement, Mr Portillo said jobcentre staff had
played an important part in cutting unemployment by more than 600,000
since December 1992.
''They are on target to place around 1.85 million people into jobs in
1994-95, an excellent achievement.
''The demanding new targets I am announcing today will require them to
do even better.''
Setting out the 1.85 million objective, Mr Portillo said: ''I want to
target the help on those most in need.
''Over 560,000 are to be people who have been out of work for more
than six months, over 500,000 people in inner cities and over 75,000 --
the highest total ever -- are to be people with disabilities.''
* Contracting out council services has cost the taxpayer millions of
pounds and has led to job losses, pay cuts and a worsening of workers'
conditions, according to a new report.
The policy of compulsory competitive tendering for cleaning, refuse
collection and other council services has saved local authorities #124m
since it began in 1988.
However, 74,000 jobs have been shed, leading to lost taxes and
National Insurance contributions totalling #250m, according to the
report for the Equal Opportunities Commission.

TREASURY Chief Secretary Jonathan Aitken received the public backing
of the Prime Minister and cheers of support from Tory back benchers
yesterday, as he went on the offensive against the latest ''sleaze
allegations''' to hit his nine-month Cabinet career.
Mr Aitken brushed aside Labour demands for an urgent independent
inquiry into claims that he had full knowledge of illegal arms sales to
Iran. Instead, he assured MPs there was ''no reason to challenge my
integrity or my position in the Government''.
Despite a second day of newspaper claims concerning his involvement
with the Grantham-based arms dealer British Manufacturer and Research
Company (BMARC), Mr Aitken's robust denial of any wrongdoing on the
floor of the Commons appeared to satisfy Tory MPs and lift the pressure
on him to resign.
Allegations that he had approved a #15m sale of naval guns to Tehran
by BMARC while he was one of the company's non-executive directors were
no more than ''irresponsible comments'', he said.
The Independent newspaper yesterday carried further details from
former BMARC chairman Gerald James of board meetings Mr Aitken is
alleged to have attended at which the deal -- codenamed Project Lisi --
was discussed.
Undeterred, Mr Aitken used his appearance at the monthly session of
Treasury Questions to turn on his attackers. ''What we are seeing here
is an unholy alliance of a failed chairman and a failing newspaper, and
it's no reason to challenge my integrity or my position in this
Government,'' he told cheering MPs.
He said he had seen nothing to suggest that the weapons were going
elsewhere than Singapore, the destination stated in the order, despite
Mr James's insistence -- repeated yesterday -- that the former Defence
Minister must have been ''blind and deaf'' not to know the weapons were
going to Iran.
Mr Aitken was at Mr Major's side during Prime Minister's Questions
when Edinburgh South MP Nigel Griffiths asked if Mr Aitken was a ''fit
and proper'' person to have in the Cabinet.
Mr Major replied: ''He has made his position absolutely clear. No
evidence has been found to counter that either by the Independent
newspaper or by anyone else.''
Labour's first challenge had come earlier during Treasury Questions
from Shadow Chief secretary Andrew Smith, who asked: ''Given the
importance of your office, do you believe you now have the confidence of
the country?''
To cheers from Tory MPs, Mr Aitken replied: ''Yes, I do''.
Reading from a prepared note, he welcomed the opportunity to reiterate
his position. ''Let me make it crystal clear that at no board meeting of
the company I was on the board of seven years ago, and in no board paper
of that company, was I ever given the slightest indication or
information that could suggest that the company's wholly legitimate
contract with Singapore might subsequently result in components being
shipped to Iran.
''My view of these matters has now been publicly supported by four
former directors of the company, including General Isles who was
responsible for the contract, including the managing director of the
company, and so the deposed and bitter chairman is now isolated on his
own in making irresponsible comments.''
Later, the Government rejected a demand from Shadow Leader of the
House Ann Taylor for an ''immediate, specific and independent inquiry to
ensure Parliament has the chance to learn and assess the full facts
surrounding this case.''
On Wednesday, Mr Aitken issued two statements in which he claimed to
have no recollection of Project Lisi, which was agreed in 1986 in
violation of the Government's guidelines for trade with Iran. Mr Aitken
joined the company as a #10,000-a-year non-executive director in 1988.
Mr James, who was chairman of the parent company Astra Holdings,
alleges that Mr Aitken attended a number of board meetings at which
Operation Lisi was discussed and also received regular secret progress
reports. However, Major General Donald Isles, another director, has
backed Mr Aitken's version of events.
It emerged yesterday that Mr Aitken sought to persuade Lord Justice
Scott to look into the allegations as part of his long-running inquiry
into arms sales to Iraq.
The request has been refused because Project Lisi involved Iran and
therefore did not fall within the inquiry's terms of reference.

NASTY shocks have given pupils at one of Grampian's biggest schools an
extended Easter holiday.
Mini lightning bolts have emerged from people's fingers as lights were
turned on amid freak atmospheric conditions.
As a precaution, Fraserburgh Academy has been forced to shut down
temporarily.
The problem was discovered when cleaning and janitorial staff
experienced electric shocks when they touched light switches.
Head teacher John Rankin immediately ordered the school's closure.
Engineers from Scottish Hydro-Electric were called in, and it became
clear the shocks were caused by electro-static discharges.
''Everyone builds-up a certain amount of static electricity in their
body and clothing in the course of everyday activities. In normal
circumstances, this will be dissipated as you walk around the
building,'' said Mr Alastair Gunn, assistant director (electrical) of
the regional council's property department.
''If the environment is sufficiently dry, however, these charges do no
easily leak away to earth.
''An unusual sequence of weather in Fraserburgh, when cold and snow
was followed by a fine morning, created this type of atmosphere.
''The static was unable to leak away and people built-up an unusually
high level. When they approached something like a light switch, which is
connected to an earthing system, the static found an immediate avenue of
escape and leapt across to the switch.
''Fortunately this phenomenon is not life-threatening. But it can be
an alarming experience to see what is a miniature lightning bolt jump
from your finger to the light switch, accompanied by an audible crack
and a mild sting on the finger.''
Mr Gunn said the remedy was to spray a special material on the floors
and floor coverings, which improved their conductivity allowing the
static to be discharged.
The school will remain closed for the rest of the week and by the time
the Easter vacation ends on April 17 all floors will have been treated.

AN Andean condor named Wallace has become the first of the species to
settle in Scotland.
The jumbo jet of the bird world, which has a wing span of 11ft, is
thriving on a diet of two trout a day, complemented by a haunch of
venison a week, at the Scottish Falconry Centre near Kinross.
The centre is in the area of Tayside where Mary Queen of Scots is
known to have enjoyed falconry.
The Andean condor is an endangered species, and the centre was chosen
by Los Angeles zoo, which is running a captive breeding project, to rear
the bird. It is hoped he will be mated in the future, to help save the
species.
Capable of soaring to heights of 18,000ft in the natural habitat of
the high Andes, three-year-old Wallace went far higher on his flight to
Scotland -- he came by plane.

A CHAIR designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh is expected to fetch up
to #100,000 at an auction today.
The oak high-back chair, which comes from Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms in
Glasgow's Argyle Street, is described as ''exceedingly rare'' by London

Lesley Duncan goes down to the Palace of Holyroodhouse again and finds
radical improvements
MARY Queen of Scots really did sleep here -- here, of course, being
the Palace of Holyroodhouse. The connection draws admirers of the
hapless, feckless Stuart Queen from all round the world. But how many
readers, I wonder, have visited Holyrood in the last decade? No, sorties
to royal garden parties don't count, though a source of social
one-up-manship. The question concerns ordinary tours of Edinburgh's
royal residence. Until this spring, my own last one had been as a
schoolgirl.
A wind of change has been blowing through the great salons of Charles
II's extended chateau at the foot of the Royal Mile. It's not the
eastern blast that habitually wraps itself round Arthur's Seat and the
Salisbury Crags, but a new attitude towards public access and amenities.
Its local driving force is the palace superintendent, Colonel David
Anderson, an Ulsterman and former deputy governor of the Tower of
London, who came to Edinburgh 18 months ago. He is overseeing radical
changes and improvements both inside the palace and in the grounds. The
results are impressive.
Until now, the public -- coach parties and private groups -- have
approached the palace through side gates which haven't offered the best
first view of it. From tomorrow that will change. Stone buildings in the
mews to the west of the palace concourse have been stylishly converted
to house a new ticket office and a roomy shop. The stables, complete
with iron mangers but not alas horses, will be open to view and there
will be a display of carriages, including the intriguingly named
Balmoral Sociable (what Deeside beanfeasts did that convey?). The public
will filter into the palace courtyard through the arched entrance of the
guardhouse. This offers a full frontal view of the palace with its
towered and turreted extremities.
Heading for the palace doorway visitors pass the fountain -- a
fantastic edifice, festooned with figures in doublet and hose, rampant
lions, stags, and much else besides. Its soft stone, ravaged by damp,
gives it an appearance of antiquity well beyond its Victorian
provenance.
For the first time in the palace's history the gardens are to be
opened to the public. On a sunny day, a treat not to be ignored. There
are seven acres of grounds, mostly lawn with a red-blaise path winding
past rockeries, beds of shrubs and heathers, and a small fish-pond
regularly unstocked by a predatory heron. Already cherry trees are
showing pink. There are blue patches of cilla. Miniature daffs are
flowering. Crocuses make a jaunty ring round a birch tree. The
unfamiliar sideways view of the palace with the adjacent ruins of the
abbey and Arthur's Seat beyond is an impressive one, even if the
ordinary public will not be treated to the sight of royals or the taste
of strawberry tarts, the staple food of summer garden parties.
One unorthodox aspect of the gardens may have vanished by then. In the
lee of the abbey buildings, where the old coke-fired boiler-house is
being demolished, skeletons of women and children have been found.
Nothing nefarious is implied. The bones probably date from the fifteenth
century. Two cheery archaeologists from a Glasgow University-linked
company have been investigating the site.
On, then, to the palace itself. Visitors are ushered up the great
stair which has welcomed royalty, moderatorial dignitaries, and, on one
recent trumpeted occasion, EC heads of state. It's a fitting place for
national pretensions. Tapestries line the lower section of the
stairwell, while above them, at neck-craning height, the mythological
gods and centaurs of Gambara's sixteenth-century Italian frescoes glow
in their glorious pastel colours and newly cleaned condition. A
specially commissioned carpet by Stoddard's of Elderslie echoes the
subtle petrel blues of tapestries and frescoes.
The red carpet has been rolled out for the public in the throne room
(the Queen was consulted on the rich crimson of the acanthus-scroll
design). Instead of being herded along one side of the chamber, visitors
can admire it from centre-stage. The picture gallery, too, has had the
red carpet treatment. Again visitors are free to pace its length and eye
Jacob de Wet's instant portraiture of Charles II's Scottish ancestors,
stretching back into myth. A surprising number of these imaginary
portraits, including a couple of Eugeniuses (no doubt others are lurking
on the walls) and a rather demented-looking Robert the Bruce, seem to
share Charles's big squashy nose. Ah, well, flattering one's patron has
always been a sensible precept for artists.
In the other public rooms, including the morning drawing-room and the
king's bedroom, the main impression is of splendid woodwork and the
faded blue and beige magnificence of tapestries. Among the latter is a
series representing the embarrelled philosopher Diogenes, whose
memorable snub of Alexander the Great is depicted.
Three lovely wood-panelled rooms will house exhibitions which require
humidity control. Two pictures there have special significance in this
250th anniversary year of the '45 rising. Both are familiar from history
books. One by Pettie shows Bonnie Prince Charlie flanked by two Highland
chieftains; the other, Redcoats and Highlanders locked in combat at
Culloden.
The high point of the palace tour for many will be Mary Queen of
Scots' apartments in the James V tower. Guide books in four languages --
Japanese included -- will reflect the international appeal of her story.
The refurbished apartments will now house the royal collection of Stuart
relics -- largely formed by that other Queen Mary, George V's spouse.
The collection comes from Windsor Castle. The Darnley jewel -- a gold
enamel and jewel-studded locket made for the ill-fated Darnley's mother
-- would still be covetable today (and indeed replicas can be had at the
palace shop). Needlework panels, reputedly made by Mary Queen of Scots
in her English imprisonment, a silver pomander, and a rosary and
crucifix are among other objects associated with her. Relics of later
Stuarts include a needle-work layette for the infant James VI.
In addition, Clouet's exquisite miniature of Mary in a red dress can
be seen as well as the poignant picture of the beruffed young Darnley
with his wee brother. Other pictures -- some 58 in all -- have come to
Edinburgh from the southern royal collections. These include a Madonna
and Child by Lucas Cranach and the bonnie but mysterious Fair Rosamunde.
Another portrait of Mary, retrieved from a storage-shed at Holyrood, has
also been restored to public display.
* Entrance charges for the palace are: adult, #5; child, #3.50; family
ticket, #12.

<HEADLINE>Latest Vatican encyclical underlines Catholic position on the sanctity of all human life Pope condemns 'culture of death'</HEADLINE>

POPE John Paul II yesterday re-affirmed the Roman Catholic Church's
stance on the sanctity of life and its hard-line opposition to abortion,
euthanasia, birth control and artificial techniques to assist
conception.
His views, expressed in an encyclical on moral issues, warned of the
expansion of ''a culture of death'' in society.
The document also contains a dilution of the Church's attitude to
capital punishment. Until now, it has supported the death penalty to
defend society in certain circumstances, but the Pope said yesterday
that such cases were ''very rare'', and an alternative could almost
always be found.
He said: ''The nature and extent of the punishment must be carefully
evaluated and decided upon, and ought not go to the extreme of executing
the offender except in cases of absolute necessity: when it would not be
possible otherwise to defend society.
''Today, however, as a result of steady improvements in the
organisation of the penal system, such cases are very rare, if not
practically non-existent.''
Elsewhere in the 194-page encyclical, Evangelium Vitae, the Pope
confirms his reputation as a theological conservative on social matters.
The paper, which draws on the views of bishops, was written at the
request of cardinals meeting in Rome four years ago.
The most fundamental pronouncement, which runs through the text, says:
''I confirm that the direct and voluntary killing of an innocent human
being is always gravely immoral.''
On abortion, once described by the Vatican as an ''unspeakable
crime'', the Pope recalls the teaching of the church that from the time
an ovum is fertilised a new life is born.
He considers abortion as a ''grave moral disorder'' and although
recognising there are tragic circumstances in which women are impelled
to have abortions, he says the act is morally wrong.
The judgment on the morality of abortion is also applied to recent
experimentation on human embryos. A growth of laws allowing assisted
human conception often resulted in embryos being destroyed needlessly,
which was a ''crime against their dignity as human beings''.
This also applied to living foetuses or embryos produced to provide
tissue for treatment for certain diseases, but pre-natal diagnostic
tests were allowed, as long as they did not lead to selective abortion.
On birth control, the Pope says he is well aware of the assertion that
contraception, if made safe and available to all, is the most effective
remedy against abortion. But a ''contraceptive mentality'' could lead to
the ''temptation'' for abortion.
Turning to euthanasia, the encyclical says it is a ''grave violation
of the law -- since it is the deliberate and morally unacceptable
killing of a human person''.
The Pope makes a distinction between euthanasia and a decision to
forego ''aggressive medical treatment'', which no longer corresponds to
the real condition of the patient.
He also acknowledges palliative care, where pain may be relieved with
drugs, even when there is a loss of consciousness and a shortening of
life. In these cases, death is not intended even though there is a risk
of ending it.
Cardinal Thomas Winning, the Archbishop of Glasgow, welcomed the
encyclical and described it as ''a valuable contribution to building a
society in which every human being is cherished''.
He added: ''While it condemns evil in the clearest possible terms . .
. it is a compassionate document. What could be more compassionate than
taking the side of the most dependent among us, the unborn at risk of
death and the sick and frail, whose condition tempts us to see killing
as a solution.''
Cardinal Basil Hume, the leader of Roman Catholics in England and
Wales, welcomed the letter as an ''inspiring exposition'' which went to
the heart of the fundamental moral question -- the value of human life.

areas in the west of Scotland which suffered the worst damage during
last December's floods. After visits to Torrance and Kirkintilloch
families whose homes were badly affected, he was shown restoration work
on the Argyle rail line, which was submerged by 11 million gallons of
water from the River Kelvin.
Mr Ashdown was accompanied by Scottish party leader Jim Wallace, and
Councillor Keith Moody, a Lib-Dem candidate in the new East

<HEADLINE>Shetlands council to limit ferry fare rises</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>10</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979124460</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SHETLAND ferry passengers were celebrating last night after the
islands council changed tack and decided by just one vote to scrap huge
fare rises.
All charges on inter-island ferries will now rise by 10% from Saturday
-- instead of the 60-85% proposed when the council discussed the rate
three weeks ago.
The 10-votes-to-nine decision was a victory for passengers after a
month-long campaign run by volunteers in the nine off-lying islands
served by the council's ferry fleet.
The council's transport chairman, Councillor Magnus Flaws, was
defeated by his own vice-chairman, Mr Tavish Scott, in a two-hour
debate. Councillor Flaws said he did not know where the extra cash would
come from in his budget.
Councillors reversed their budget cuts policy and approved a
contingency fund of up to #240,000 in case ferry costs went over the
limit this year -- but Councillor Scott insisted that savings could be
made and it would not be needed.
Councillors had already agreed a complete review of all transport
services in Shetland -- including the ferries -- and this will now
concentrate on the search for further economies.
Protesters celebrated with champagne on the steps of Lerwick Town Hall
as Councillor Scott told them the vote showed they had ''sown doubt in
the minds of councillors'' about the accuracy of ferry budget figures
produced by officials.
Spokeswoman for the Bressay Ferry Users Association, Ms Caroline
Miller, said: ''I'm absolutely delighted. This is a victory for common
sense.''
Finance director, Mr Andrew Matthews, had disputed the figures in an
alternative business plan put forward by the users association, and
claimed that, when inflation was taken into account, the proposed fares
which had caused the uproar were ''not unprecedented''.
But he agreed with Councillor Scott that the ferry management's
initial estimates had been out by #240,000 because of unbudgeted sums
for sick leave, ferry maintenance, recruitment and training.
Marine Operations chairman, Mr Willie Tait, whose department oversees
the ferries for the transport committee, warned that the Accounts
Commission had criticised the council for its ''ridiculously low fare''
policy. Fares should be ''realistic'' because the council could not ''go
on subsidising at a high level for ever''.
About 50 members of the public were present as the council divided on
a roll-call of votes over a series of amendments. In the end, the vote
cast by Convener Lewis Smith, gave victory to Councillor Scott.

John Fowler previews the Edinburgh Science Festival which opens today.
ANUMBER of normally sensible and level-headed people will shortly be
seen wandering over the Meadows, Edinburgh's stretch of urban parkland,
with their heads bowed, their eyes down, and clutching lengths of
coat-hanger wire. I hope to be one of them.
Every so often we may -- or may not -- give yelps of excitement as the
coat-hangers go mad in our hands.
Our leader will be Simon Gage, usually credited with being a
respectable and responsible scientist. Dr Gage is acting director of the
Edinburgh Science Festival, which this year marks its seventh year.
He has organised this bizarre excursion to the Meadows as an
experiment in dowsing, the age-old practice by which certain people have
the apparently magical power to detect water underground, usually with
the aid of a hazel twig. No one knows how it happens -- which is a
challenge to any scientist -- and whether the gift is latent in all of
us or just a few.
Perhaps some answers will be revealed on Saturday, April 8, when the
dowse-in takes place.
Gage's fascination with dowsing goes back to boyhood when he performed
his first experiment in the back garden, using two ballpoint pens
stripped of their ink tubes as holders, with lengths of coat-hanger wire
plugged into them. When the wires started to twitch he called his father
who confirmed that he'd just walked over a water main.
''Could I do that?'' I asked him.
''That's what we hope to find out,'' he replied.
There are plenty of similar hands-on experiments to be performed by
the public -- adults and children -- in this year's festival, which
opens today and continues to April 17. Some of them, such as the
dowsing, are instructive fun. But at the core of the festival is a
series of talks, discussions and demonstrations which relate to some of
the most fundamental questions about our lives and the universe.
The science of genetics -- research into the basic structures of life
-- is one of the themes recurrent in many of the events, from extracting
DNA from an onion (another experiment we can all join in -- just bring
your own onion) to an afternoon symposium in which experts will discuss
the social implications of new reproductive techniques.
Space research, from the technology of spacecraft to the make-up of
the moon or the origins of the universe, is another thread. It's handy
for the festival that the Star Trek exhibition is at the City Arts
Centre at the moment, and a number of events relate to topics that
concern both science-fiction addicts and physicists.
We can, for example, hear about designing starships from Professor
Heinz Wolff of Brunel University, who will tackle such questions as can
we ever hope to visit the stars, and how may we do it?
Professor Wolff is no mere theorist -- he has worked on space-lab
designs, and in an allied and at least as practical role he has designed
tools for the handicapped. He is, says Dr Gage, a crusader with a
burning drive to share his knowledge with the public.
Also, a small bonus: ''Heinz Wolff looks the archetypal scientist,''
says Gage. ''German accent, bald head with tufts of hair at the sides,
and he wears a bow tie.'' Heinz sounds like an Einstein clone.
High-power scientists abound. Professor Peter Higgs of Edinburgh
University, for example, will lecture on particle interactions. He is
widely tipped for a Nobel Prize for his work on identifying the particle
named after him as the Higgs boson. This, says Gage, is ''another step
in the process of understanding the basics of the universe, giving a
link to what was going on around the Big Bang at the beginning of
time''.
Someone who didn't get a Nobel Prize (though her boss did) is Dr
Jocelyn Bell Burnell of the Open University who as a student was the
first to detect a pulsar -- one of the mysterious sources emitting radio
waves at regular intervals from outer space. She will host a ''star
party'' at the Royal Observatory (light refreshments and a glass of
wine, with the wonder of the universe thrown in).
Medicine and health is another subject which crops up a lot. Several
events assess developments in cancer research and treatment. The growing
interest in herbal medicine, now belatedly being accorded approval in
orthodox medical circles, is reflected in a talk by Michael McIntyre, a
herbal practitioner, whose experience includes working in a Chinese
hospital whose traditional herbal treatments are accepted alongside
Western-style practice.
On the same day, in a talk on parasites, we are asked to meet (among
others) ''the amoeba that eats your eyes out'', an invitation I trust we
needn't take literally.
Perhaps the peckish amoeba fancies a pizza? Anyone who does is invited
to a demonstration on cooking the dish followed by a tasting session.
All sorts of delicate and surprisingly complicated scientific processes
are involved in producing just the right yum-yum factor in your
carry-out. Dr Maureen Cooper of Stirling University will be dishing out
the recipe in the Royal Museum of Scotland.
Edinburgh bills itself as ''the largest science festival on earth''.
There's another one at Naples which might be a rival, Gage admits, but
no-one achieves so much with so little -- Edinburgh has a staff of only
seven and costs #300,000. Last year there was a total number of 200,000
visits to the exhibitions, outings, talks and discussions.
''We are recognised throughout Europe'', says Gage. ''Lots of people
come over to see how we do it.''
Gage was a research scientist at Edinburgh University before he moved
over to the festival. ''Partly, I was getting dissatisfied with life as
a researcher,'' he says. ''I was lucky that Britain's first science
festival popped up in Edinburgh where I was living.''
Also, his parents were both in entertainment. His mother was a singer
and his father was in television. At heart he's a ham, which is what
attracts him to a show like this.
A final warning. Don't believe all you hear at the science festival.
Appearing for three nights at the Traverse Theatre is the Annoyance
Theatre of Chicago, a group of three actor-scientists who undertake to
prove any outlandish scientific proposition you like to suggest. At the
Fringe last year they proved impeccably that live chickens constitute
the earth's core.
So -- the earth is flat and the sun goes round it? No problem.
* The Edinburgh International Science Festival is at various venues.
Many events are free.

Pat Kane on America's need for excesses of law and an enthusiasm for
Scotland's 'not-proven' verdict.
THE American way of law appears more concerned with showbusiness than
due process at the moment. Mention the dread letters ''OJ'' and American
law looms lurid in the mind: a procession of theatrical, sharp-suited LA
attorneys, pulverising minor details of evidence to pieces, while a
sporting icon pouts in the corner. It's bad soap-opera, and an even
worse advert for the US legal system.
But there are deeper reasons for the prominence of the Simpson
spectacle, beyond the blood and the bimbos and the Bronco chase. America
has litigiousness at the very core of its national identity -- starting
obviously with the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and widening out
into a whole culture of popular legalism. It may seem outrageous that
there's a lawyer for every 200 Americans, which makes them as numerous
as grocery store owners. But like foods and fluids, Americans need their
excesses of law -- to survive their dangerous times.
During my recent investigation into American law for BBC Radio
Scotland, I talked to the major stars in the legal firmament; my
impression was of the sharpest minds, dealing with their civilisation at
its most formative level. The noblest defence of America's national
obsession with law came from Ronald Dworkin, emeritus professor at New
York University, and the country's most esteemed legal theorist. For
Dworkin, it all began with the US Constitution -- the document which not
only founded America, but irreversibly fused law and morality together
at the heart of the nation.
''It's a brilliant thing the Founding Fathers did,'' enthused Dworkin
in his Miro-bedecked rooms near Washington Square. ''Because it's framed
in abstract moral principles, the Constitution means we're bound
together by law, much more than by religion or cultural tradition.'' In
any case, argued the professor, what else could Americans identify with?
''There is such enormous diversity, and pluralism, and geographical
stretch here . . . The only community we could build would be one in
which there was mutual respect across those differences -- and that's
what's provided by our constitutionally-determined law.''
For Dworkin, it was almost as if the Constitution sometimes saved the
country from itself -- or at least, from its more bizarre political
spasms. The abortion debate, the successful uproar against prayer in
schools: all came up against the power of that enduring document,
dragging American law back to its Englightenment principles of freedom
and justice. For those reasons, remarked Dworkin, ''the Congress simply
could not take away the right to silence in the way the British
Parliament has just done -- passing a law guided by votes and present
fears. It's nice when there are high moments like that here . . . for
this, I congratulate the US.''
But not everyone was as self-congratulatory as Dworkin about the moral
core of American law. One of the professor's bitterest opponents is
Catherine MacKinnon, lawyer and anti-pornography activist. Her target is
the most idealised tenet of the American Constitution -- the First
Amendment, guaranteeing freedom of expression. MacKinnon says its purity
is being used to protect pornography -- or more precisely, the crimes
committed during pornography's making, which are, in MacKinnon's grim
list, ''coercion, assault, rape, murder''.
Her aim is to bring cases to court which can prosecute porn as ''hate
speech'' against women. ''If sexual and racial harassment can be defined
in the workplace,'' said MacKinnon, ''then why not in the wider culture?
These aren't 'only words'. Free speech absolutism provides cover for
organised crime -- which is what pornography is.''
MacKinnon is a clear example of law substitution for political
activity in American society. She suffers, however, a keen irony: it's
the moral substance of the Constitution -- enshrining equality and free
speech in its amendments -- that enables her to appeal for further
change, further amendments, in the first place. Douglas Kennedy, a
leading light in the Critical Legal Studies movement at Harvard, takes
this law-as-activism approach one step further.
''American law is like a stage for the liberal intelligentsia to
pursue their projects,'' railed the radical Kennedy, who looked like a
Furry Freak Brother adrift among the leather-bound volumes of his
Cambridge office. ''Policies that wouldn't get endorsed among the
populace -- like control of porn, or affirmative action, or marriage of
gays -- can actually be gotten through the judicial process, by
establishment of legal precedent. The American legal system is group
politics by another means.''
This explains the vast torrents of public debate around such recent
celebrity trials as Anita Hill v Judge Clarence Thomas, or Mike Tyson,
or Lorena Bobbit, or the Menendez brothers . . . or Simpson. All have
bubbled up with a rich stew of race, sexuality, and abuse, from which
various political interest groups in American society have ladled their
particular share.
Kennedy thinks American litigiousness is his nation's major
contribution to Western culture in the twentieth century: ''The ability
to screw up the projects of the powerful with lawsuits . . . that's much
better than the British tugging of the forelock, suffering grievances in
silence.'' He smiles broadly. ''Little bit of American nationalism
there.''
Yet the actual courtroom lawyers who create most of this virtuous
ferment in American law are chillingly indifferent about the thorny
issues they are raising. Indeed, they pride themselves on working the
loopholes of the system as mercilessly as they can, whatever side
they're on.
And apparently, Scottish law has something particular to offer these
master hairsplitters. Alan Dershowitz was the celebrity advocate for
Mike Tyson, and is the chief legal strategist for the ''dream team'' of
OJ's defence. Dershowitz told me in New York that the Scottish verdict
of ''not proven'' would be a valuable addition to American law. ''The
law is not about determining innocence -- that's for a heavenly court to
decide. If someone is 'not guilty', it should mean they weren't proven
to be guilty.''
Later, off-mike, Dershowitz connected this to Simpson. ''In the OJ
case -- yes, that verdict would help, because it would focus the jury's
mind on the evidence at hand. 'Not proven' might allow their 'reasonable
doubts' about Simpson's accusation to be given a chance to surface. And
if they had a reasonable doubt, they would be bound by law to clear
Simpson of the charge.''
The fact that a notorious sophist like Dershowitz would love to use
Scots law to get OJ off his gory hook shouldn't puff us up with too much
national pride. But what lessons can Scots draw from the legalistic
character of American everyday life -- where the Constitution underpins
everyone's selfish belief that they have ''a right'' to something; where
adversarial values threaten a general rule of Sue Thy Neighbour, rather
than love them? Would some future Scottish Constitution produce the same
kind of nervy, litigious citizenry as America's central text does?
Professor Dworkin provided me with one last answer to the question of
America's excessive legalism, which ties the phenomenon to the very guts
of the nation's past. America was scarred by two enormous acts of
self-inflicted violence -- against the Native peoples, and in the Civil
War. ''And now we have serial killers, and long hot summers in urban
centres,'' mused Dworkin. ''So we feel that violence is the condition
into which we would fall -- but for law.''
So the power of law, its ability to contain the possibly explosive
plurality of America, was for Dworkin ''the source of the grip, to
Europeans the quite bizarre grip, that law has on our imagination''.
And perhaps that's the real appeal of the OJ Simpson case -- as a
reminder of the frontier tumult, the violent dynamics, that still
underlie the American Dream. Between the murder weapon, and the
Constitution: that's where the real juice runs.

Deedee Cuddihy becomes a supermarket sleuth in a bid to discover
whether bar code checkouts lead to happier shoppers -- or just confused
customers.
MISTAKES on your supermarket till receipt -- a regular occurrence or a
once-in-a-blue-moon event? The supermarkets would have us believe that
electronic checkout systems, where the bar code on a product is scanned
at the till, have put an end to pricing discrepancies. But even new
technology relies on humans to feed it information, so if the price of a
product has been physically reduced on the shelf but the computer file
has not been updated, the old, higher price is the one that will
register when the bar code is scanned at the till.
Electronic checkout systems have, of course, virtually cancelled out
the need for products to carry individual price tags, which must
represent a tremendous saving in labour costs for the supermarkets but
means that by the time we get to a till few of us can recall exactly how
much that tin of peaches had been reduced by. And as for remembering
what the rest of the messages were supposed to cost -- forget it.
Even if a supermarket's computer file is kept up to date, a
''hyperactive'' electronic checkout system can mean you'll be charged
double for an item if it's kept on the scanner for too long.
Which? magazine recently reported that this happened twice in four
visits to one unlucky shopper at a supermarket down south.
Andy Moynihan, a controller with Strathclyde Regional Council's
consumer and trading standards department, says that while they deal
with relatively few complaints about grocery prices, his observations of
an increasing number of shoppers using calculators as they fill their
baskets lead him to believe that not everybody has as much confidence in
electronic checkout systems as the supermarket bosses do.
But the introduction of new electronic gadgetry which would flash up
the price of a product as you put it in your trolley and then tot up
your bill, thus saving the shopper time and the supermarket even more
money -- you'd be doing the checkout person's job, you see -- is a
development which was not greeted with universal approval when it was
mooted in a recent survey.
''Elderly people, and particularly those who lived on their own,''
Andy Moynihan explained, ''said they enjoyed having a leisurely wander
around their local supermarket and a chat with the cashier who might be
the only person they'd speak to all day.''
I was surprised to hear that checkout staff had the time to talk to
anyone, what with having to whip merchandise across the scanner so fast
that it didn't have a chance to register twice -- or even thrice, if the
system was feeling particularly hyper that day.
Although I shop in my local supermarket as often as three times a
week, I never buy more than a basketful of groceries and only check my
till receipt if the total is way outside my own mental calculation of
what I've spent. In other words, a few pence could be added to every
item I buy and I'd probably never notice -- or would hesitate to mention
it if I did. To my mind, there are few things more embarrassing than
querying the price of a packet of tea biscuits only to be shown by the
cashier, as impatient shoppers tut-tut behind you, that you are wrong
and she is right.
A Safeway guarantee that they will give you, free of charge, any item
that is rung up incorrectly, is obviously aimed not at wimpish consumers
like me but at militants such as my friend Vicky who, along with other
people I observed recently during an afternoon of strenuous supermarket
hopping, has turned the everyday act of grocery-buying into an art form.
(Vicky's the one who collects free-offer coupons so assiduously that she
once, so it was rumoured, bought #40 worth of messages without spending
any money at all.)
I bumped into Vicky in a checkout queue at the Byres Road Safeway at
the start of my tour and she immediately solicited my opinion about the
price of a packet of chicken and garlic goujons whose bar code had been
cancelled because the sell-by date had almost run out.
''Looks like #1.10 to me,'' I said.
Her face fell. ''I think it says 40p,'' she replied and gave me such a
hard look that I quickly added, ''although it could be 40p, I suppose.''
But the cashier wasn't buying it -- and neither did Vicky.
The woman in front of me at the Safeway checkout also had the goujons
as well as some tikka-style chicken breasts reduced from #2.69 to #1.69
and seemed quite happy with her bargains. Her quibble was over the price
of parsnips.
''Aren't they 29p a pound?'' she asked, as the cashier rang up 49p. A
boy was despatched to find out and, returning with the sad news that the
cashier was right, the parsnips were left at the till.
Asda in Summerston has undergone substantial changes since I was last
there and now has what must be the most stunning display of fruit and
veg in any supermarket in Glasgow. Everything looks as if it has been
hand polished and just cries out to be eaten.
I came away with more than I intended to buy, having failed to detect
any disturbances at the checkout.
The Co-op superstore in Maryhill offered a complete contrast to Asda.
Here is a shop, you are forced to conclude, which is trying to save its
customers money by making the goods look so unappealing they'll only
want to buy the bare necessities. At the checkout, the lettering on one
of the wooden bars which separates your shopping from everyone else's on
the conveyor belt, had become so worn it just read ''Cus''.
A pensioner who was buying two bargain packs of Polo Mints (12 tubes
for the price of 10) and some frozen cod queried the cost of the fish.
The ubiquitous boy was sent on a trek back to the frozen food cabinets
and he eventually returned with what appeared to be two identical
packets of cod -- one dressed in crumbs, the other in batter, and it was
the battered fish that was on offer.
Sainsbury's in Darnley is the kind of supermarket that people dress up
to go to. (They serve Earl Grey tea in the cafe and even the women
operating the checkouts wear full makeup.) It's also just the sort of
place that impulse shoppers should avoid. I, for one -- having spent
more than #11 on essentials like kosher taco chips, mini jars of
raspberry jam, some Channel Islands butter and a knitted tammy -- am
never going there again.
There was some trouble at the tills due, not to hyperactive electronic
checkout systems but overactive shoppers. An infant who was already
fretful when its mother began loading a trolly was positively hysterical
by the time she had filled it virtually to overflowing. And I was so
surprised by my #11 total that I decided to question the price of the
hat -- only to discover that, as usual, I was wrong and the cashier was
right.
Meanwhile, over on Arran, Curries supermarket in Brodick has recently
reopened after a whirlwind refurbishment and now boasts the island's
first automatic doors -- much to the annoyance, no doubt, of the Co-op
which opened a brand new store in Brodick this week and must have
assumed it was going to be first in the automatic doors stakes.

<TEXT>
TWO young boys unearthed a sawn-off shotgun as they played on waste
ground. Hidden nearby were 20 rounds of live 12-bore cartridges.
The gun was discovered in the earth beneath a tree close to the
Lanarkshire village of Hartwood. The find comes after a loaded revolver
was found in West Lothian last week.
Stephen Morrison, seven, and five-year-old Ross McKenna were playing
in the field near Bowhousebog Road in Hartwood when they dug into the
soil and brought out a polythene bag wrapped tightly with sticky tape.
Inside was the unloaded double-barrelled sawn-off shotgun, which they
carried to the road where a local man yelled at them to put it down.
Police were called and returned with the boys to the spot, where a
further search revealed the cache of cartridges.
A senior police spokesman at Wishaw praised the boys for acting
sensibly when they found the gun on Sunday.
He confirmed that it had not been loaded.
He added: ''The boys were in no danger. But obviously there are
dangers to the public, especially if ammunition is alongside the weapon.
''Young children are at special risk as they think it is a toy.''

Paris, Thursday
FRANCE was virtually paralysed by a ''Black Thursday'' of public
transport strikes to demand higher pay and an end to job cuts in the
midst of a presidential election campaign.
Trains, the Paris metro underground railway system, buses and domestic
flights were severely disrupted and about 1000 demonstrating workers at
the domestic airline Air Inter briefly blocked a runway at Paris Orly
airport, causing further delays.
The widely-observed strikes overshadowed news of the fifth successive
monthly fall in unemployment, which should have given conservative Prime
Minister Edouard Balladur's flagging campaign a welcome boost.
The jobless total fell by 10,200 in February to stand at 3.3 million
or 12.3% of the workforce, still the highest rate among the Group of
Seven major industralised nations.
But it was commuters' misery and anger that grabbed the headlines, and
wage claims that dominated political debate ahead of France's April-May
presidential election.
An opinion poll released today showed a six-point fall in public
confidence in Balladur's centre-right Government.
Only 39% of voters now think the Government is doing a good job, while
55% disapprove, the Louis Harris poll for the weekly Profession
Politique showed.
The national railway company SNCF said just one train in four was
running on main lines and suburban services were curtailed. Only the
Channel Tunnel Eurostar service and the Paris-Lausanne high-speed train
line were running normally.
The state-owned Air Inter cancelled half its domestic flights as
workers staged the third strike in as many weeks to protest against
planned layoffs, saying they were being forced to pay the price for
losses at parent company Air France.
In Paris, the RATP transport authority said six of the 13 underground
train lines were closed and on the seven open lines commuters had to
wait an average 20 minutes between trains.
Many Parisians walked to work. There were few buses and police said
traffic jams up to 10 miles long formed on motorways into the capital.
RATP staff are demanding a 3.2% wage rise this year, while inflation
is forecast to be just below 2%.
Postal and electricity workers were also on strike in some regions and
state-controlled carmaker Renault, which announced on Tuesday its
profits more than tripled in 1994, continued to be hit by sporadic
stoppages to demand higher pay. Renault management said only two plants
were affected today.
The presidential campaign has fuelled wage claims.
Not only have the Socialist and Communist candidates, Lionel Jospin
and Robert Hue, demanded increases for the low-paid, but Paris mayor
Jacques Chirac, the conservative front-runner, has said workers deserve
a fairer share of economic growth after three years of austerity.
Slamming technocrats who argue that job creation should take
precedence over pay rises, Chirac said it was ''absurd economic
nonsense'' to say wages were the enemy of jobs.
Balladur said yesterday it was ''perfectly normal (and) legitimate''
that workers wanted to benefit from the fruits of recovery after the
deepest recession since the Second World War. But he warned workers not
to ''break the machine'' by demanding too much.
Touring Belfort in eastern France, Jospin declared his support for the
transport workers, saying they were defending their jobs and incomes
against threats to public services.
''Electing Lionel Jospin as president is the guarantee that social
rights will be defended, including the right to new economic progress by
sharing the fruits of growth,'' he said.
Only maverick right-wing presidential candidate Philippe de Villiers
sought to cash in on the unpopularity of the transport stoppages, saying
he would ban public service strikes.
The transport workers were lucky to have guaranteed jobs, even if they
did not earn enough, he said in a radio interview.--Reuter.

<TEXT>
THE chief executive of SmithKline Beecham was paid #2.4m last year,
the year the firm closed a factory and axed 490 jobs.
Mr Jan Leschly's pay packet included an expenses payment of more than
#800,000 to cover relocation costs to America.
Three months ago the pharmaceutical giant closed its St Helens plant,
where the company was founded 135 years ago.
St Helens Council leader, Mr Dave Watts, said: ''This is yet another
example of just how unfair the present system is when a company making
record profits and awarding massive executive pay closes down its
founding operation.''
A company spokesman defended Mr Leschly's salary. ''While there is
criticism of directors' pay, you must remember that Mr Leschly is
running a corporation which employs 52,700 people worldwide,'' he said.
''The salary is what we have to pay to attract senior executives
running a company of that size.''
Mr Steve Roberts, former secretary of the GMB union at the factory,
said: ''People will be disgusted and astounded when they find out how
much he got. It is yet another example of corporation greed.''
Labour MP for St Helens North, Mr John Evans, said: ''Unfortunately,
this move does not surprise me at all. It is just part of a growing
trend throughout this country after 16 years of Tory Government.
''The Conservatives have continually preached the doctrine of
selfishness and greed and now it's coming to light.''

Tokyo, Thursday
A MASKED gunman seriously wounded Japan's national police chief today
and anonymous calls to television networks linked the shooting to last
week's nerve gas attacks on the Tokyo subway.
In what Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama called a new ''dastardly
challenge'' to law and order in Japan, the gunman fired four bullets
into Takaji Kunimatsu, director-general of the National Police Agency,
outside his Tokyo home.
A doomsday sect under scrutiny for the sarin nerve-gas attack which
killed 10 people and poisoned 5000 on March 20 denied involvement in the
shooting and police held back from publicly blaming the attack on the
cult.
''Aum Shinri Kyo has absolutely nothing to do with this incident,''
the sect said in a statement.
Police sources did not rule out the possibility that Kunimatsu, a
high-profile police chief for his fight against gangsters, was the
target of a ''yakuza'' hitman.
Other police sources told Kyodo news agency that a massive hunt was
underway for 100 key members of the Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth) sect
who were at large after quietly leaving cult locations three days before
the subway gassing.
Kunimatsu, 57, was in serious condition after a six-hour operation to
remove bullets from his body.
The gunman fired from about 25 yards after staking out the police
chief's apartment complex for more than an hour. He escaped on a
bicycle.
Kunimatsu was shot as police in gas masks and riot gear began a ninth
day of searches of the sect's main complex at the foot of Mount Fuji,
about one hour's drive from Tokyo.
The search has unconvered secret underground chambers where hundreds
of tonnes of lethal chemicals, including all the ingredients to make
sarin, were stored.
Kyodo said the 100 hard core followers sought by police were members
of the sect's ''Science and Technology Agency''. They were mainly
university science graduates including many with advanced degress in
organic chemistry, biology and genetic engineering.
The group, described as fanatically devoted to the sect's Japanese
founder Shoko Asahara, was divided into teams specialising in chemistry,
biology, physics and medicine.
In almost idential messages to two Japanese television networks,
separate anonymous callers said Kunimatsu was shot on behalf of the sect
and other senior law enforcement officials were on a hit list.
''Listen carefully,'' one caller told Nippon Television. ''I will tell
you only once -- the Aum Shinri Kyo shot Kunimatsu.''
The call to TV Asahi said other senior officials would be attacked
unless the investigation into the sect was halted.
Murayama ordered extra security at the homes of government Ministers
and all officials involved in the nerve gas inquiry. ''We had long
believed that Japan was a safe country unlike other countries in the
world,'' he said in a statement.
Coming on the heels of last week's nightmarish subway nerve gas
killings, the shooting stunned Japan, a country that has placed great
trust in its 260,000-strong police force.
The attacks have frightened and fundamentally altered the mood of a
people once basking in economic success and confident their society was
free of the crime that curses the West.
Since taking office last July, Kunimatsu led a crackdown on organised
crime. In 1992, he played a key role in drafting laws making it
difficult for ''yakuza'' crime syndicates to extort money by threatening
to disrupt company shareholders' meetings.--Reuter

Ankara, Thursday
TURKEY went on the diplomatic offensive today to back its incursion
into Iraq, dispatching its new Foreign Minister on a tour of Western
capitals and blasting traditional ally Germany.
Stung by criticism of its 11-day push into northern Iraq in pursuit of
Kurdish rebels, Ankara lashed out at Bonn's decision to halt military
shipments, accusing it of breaking Nato ranks.
Foreign Minister Erdal Inonu, in the job just four days, announced he
would leave soon for the United States and Europe to address fears
Turkey's 35,000-strong force would remain in Iraq for long.
''I will from next week travel to Germany, the United States and
France for talks with authorities to clear up misunderstandings,'' Inonu
told a news conference.
Ankara says the military push, launched before dawn on March 20, is
needed to root out separatist rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party
(PKK) who use Iraqi bases to strike inside Turkey.
But its Western trade partners and allies fear for the safety of
Kurdish civilians and refugees in the north. Paris has also questioned
the legality of the operation, conducted inside another sovereign state.
''Contrary to false reports and misunderstandings, the duration and
scope of the operation is limited. As soon as PKK camps and facilities
in the region have been eliminated our troops will withdraw,'' Inonu
said.
Early signs suggested Inonu would find it tough going.
France, president of the European Union, said today the EU may
consider imposing an arms embargo on Turkey.
''We intend to underline once again the EU's concern at the ongoing
military intervention and reaffirm our wish that it should end as soon
as possible,'' French foreign ministry spokesman Richard Duque told
reporters.
Despite some soothing comments from Inonu, his ministry issued a
statement charging Germany with breaking the spirit of the NATO alliance
by holding back a planned shipment of military equipment in protest at
the incursion.
''Turkey needs support and cooperation from allies and friends when
its territorial unity is under threat from terrorism directed from
abroad,'' the ministry said.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) appealed to Turkey
to allow it into northern Iraq to evaluate the needs of civilians and
help wounded and captives.
The situation on the ground remained unclear, with the two sides
giving wildly conflicting death tolls.
UN aid workers escorted a third group of Turkish Kurd refugees out of
the combat zone. Packed into trucks and minibuses and accompanied by
sheep, cows and a donkey, they travelled from Zakho to safety in Atrush
60 miles away.
''We're running away from Turkey. If they catch us they will kill us,
because they say we are rebels,'' said Abdullah, 57, dressed in the
baggy trousers and black chequered headscarf common among the Kurds.
Turkey meanwhile turned on rebel Kurds closer to home, pouring up to
15,000 fresh troops into its Tunceli province for a mission that a
military official said ''is going to be like the north Iraq offensive''.
Convoys of military vehicles blocked the roads in and around the
eastern province for an expected assault on well-entrenched PKK
positions there.
Turkey launched a huge offensive on the PKK in Tunceli over the
winter, but the military later acknowledged few results.
Troops, including airborne units and special forces, backed by
long-range artillery have been converging on the province from other
parts of the country for the last three days.
The total number of soldiers posted in Tunceli may reach more than
30,000, security officials said. About 35,000 troops have been hunting
the PKK in northern Iraq since March 20.
The guerrillas, ensconced in mountains towering to more than 10,000ft,
ambushed a military convoy in Tunceli on March 18, killing 18 soldiers.
The attack cast doubt on frequent Turkish assurances the PKK, fighting
for a Kurdish homeland in Turkey, was all but defeated except for some
bases in northern Iraq.
The capture -- dead or alive -- of guerrilla regional commander Semdin
Sakik, known as ''Fingerless Zeki'' after losing a thumb firing a rocket
in north Iraq, is one of the main objectives in the Tunceli push,
soldiers said.--Reuter

SINCE it started tick, tick, ticking, time has detonated arguments and
equally explosive misunderstandings.
Scientists have argued about the big bang while husbands and wives,
sons and mothers have fought over ''what time do you call this?''
Currently, an argument is raging over whether we should change the
clocks to tack on an extra hour of daylight to the evenings. Opponents
north of the Border feel it would leave them totally in the dark in the
mornings.
Throughout, it has been The Herald's job to probe the dark corners of
the news.
Unwittingly, however, it appears that we have generated some
misunderstandings ourselves -- by getting our lighting-up times in a
fankle which has seen us giving three differing formulas for lighting-up
in the space of six months, has led to an anguished postbag and puzzled
telephone calls.
At one time, we gave the lighting-up time as 30 minutes before sunset.
Then we gave it coinciding with sunset, while finally we settled on 30
minutes after sunset.
The times are now supplied by an agency. The first timing was wrong,
the second was right, and so was the third.
Part of the confusion stems from changes introduced by the Government
in 1989. Until November 1 of that year, official lighting-up time was 30
minutes after sunset and official lighting-down time 30 minutes before
sunrise.
But the new regulations issued by the Department Transport brought the
times into line with the actual sunrise and sunset times.
The Royal Observatory at Greenwich told us that lighting-up time or
''hours of darkness for vehicles'' is from sunset to sunrise when
sidelights must be used.
But from half an hour after sunset until half an hour before sunrise,
headlights must be used.
To avoid confusing readers and to conform with other sources we will
continue to give lighting-up time to read 30 minutes after sunset. The
sunset time carried in The Herald applies to the Glasgow area.

<HEADLINE>Abortion was forced on me, claims Wren</HEADLINE>

A FORMER Wren who claimed she was forced to have an abortion to stay
in the Navy continued her battle for compensation against the Ministry
of Defence yesterday.
An industrial tribunal in Glasgow heard legal submissions on behalf of
Mrs Bernice Evans, 38, from Dalgety Bay, Fife, and the Ministry of
Defence.
Mrs Evans was not present at yesterday's hearing, but told the
tribunal earlier how she was discriminated against because she claims
she was forced to have an abortion to remain in the Navy.
Mrs Evans' representative, Mr James Kennedy, QC, agreed that Mrs Evans
had gained by continuing her career but had lost by being denied the
opportunity to have her baby and had suffered the trauma that
accompanied this loss.
He said his client had shown she had suffered damage to her health,
and that the Navy's policy of discharging pregnant women -- which would
have rendered Mrs Evans jobless and homeless -- had impelled her to make
a decision she would otherwise not have made.
Mr Alastair Dunlop, QC, representing the Ministry of Defence, urged
the tribunal not to become involved in speculation or drawing inferences
from evidence that did not exist.
The key question, he claimed, was whether the Navy's discriminatory
policy had led to her abortion. ''To answer that question in the
affirmative one would have to find evidence of that.''
Mrs Evans had told the tribunal that she had an abortion in 1980,
after which she became anxious, depressed and a virtual recluse.
She claimed a doctor told her she could not remain in the service if
she had her baby and offered to arrange a termination. She received no
counselling and said she would have liked to have had the baby. After
her abortion she was sent a #300 bill from a private hospital.
Former naval doctor David Evans said Mrs Evans had been adamant in her
request for a termination and that he had referred her for consideration
for an abortion.
He denied telling her to have an abortion in order to remain in the
Navy or that if she wanted to have the baby she would have had to leave.
Retired consultant William Gordon, who performed the termination, told
the tribunal he would never have done so without knowing that the
patient wanted it. Mrs Evans is now married with three children.
The tribunal will issue its decision later.
Mrs Evans' complaint was the first of its kind when lodged in October
last year. Since then the MoD has compensated another servicewoman who
claimed she was pressured to have an abortion while in the Navy.

Washington, Thursday
THE new Republican majority in Congress have gone down to defeat on
three measures this week, including for the first time a flat defeat in
the House of Representatives.
An attempt to limit congressional terms to 12 years was defeated
ignominiously, despite the pleas of Speaker Newt Gingrich, and the
Senate voted unanimously to overturn two Republican measures sent up to
it by the House.
It is almost unheard of for the Senate to be unanimous on a piece of
serious legislation, but all 100 members voted to dump a proposal to
freeze government regulation over the next 12 months.
That was a Bill rammed through the House by Mr Gingrich, one of the
items on his ''Contract with America'', and it is astonishing to see the
entire Republican party in the Senate rejecting it.
The Senate approved instead a measure allowing Congress to revise any
new government regulation. Since there are tens of thousands of such
rules every year, it will be a difficult task. Serious regulatory reform
will, perhaps, be brought up later.
The other Senate defeat for Mr Gingrich concerned spending cuts.
Republicans want to cut the budget, but also want to lower taxes.
The Democrats say they are cutting taxes on the wealthy by cutting
welfare for the poor. Republican senators are nervous at the charge, and
agreed on Wednesday that the profits from any spending cut should go to
reducing the deficit. The change passed unanimously.
As for term limits, Mr Gingrich was defeated by his own party. A
number of senior members saw no reason why congressional terms should be
limited. Mr Henry Hyde, a noted conservative and now chairman of the
judiciary committee, said: ''New is always better? What in the world is
conservative about that?
''Have we nothing to learn from the past? Tradition, history,
institutional memory -- don't they count anymore? They have a saying in
the provinces, ignorance is salvageable, stupid is for ever . . .''
The House voted on four versions of the Bill. The three strictest
failed to win a majority, let alone the two-thirds needed for a
constitutional amendment. The fourth won 227 votes to 204, a majority of
the 435 House but still far short of two-thirds.
One sceptical Democrat said he had never seen so many members voting
for a Bill while praying that it would fail. Term limits has a certain
public popularity, but is naturally opposed by members who like their
jobs -- a clear majority of them.
Mr Gingrich's next defeat will be over tax cuts. He may even be
defeated in the House, where there is strong opposition among moderate
Republicans, as well as Democrats. The proposal has no chance in the
Senate.

Khartoum, Thursday
SUDAN'S Islamic leaders today rolled out the red carpet for Muslim
fundamentalists from around the world as they launched a four-day
conference aimed at rallying Muslims against perceived Western
domination.
Delegates from over 80 countries, crammed into Khartoum's Friendship
Hall, condemned Arab normalisation of ties with Israel, attacked the
United Nations as a Western tool and called on Muslims to heal their
divisions.
Hassan al-Tourabi, believed to be the power behind Sudan's
Islamist-backed military Government, accused the West of trying to wipe
out Muslim independence.
''Islamists have no right to existence . . . only one culture is
acceptable (to the West),'' Tourabi told the opening session of the
third Popular Arab and Islamic Conference.
''Fundamentalist Islam . . . political Islam . . . extremist Islam and
terrorist Islam . . . should, some Westerners think, be provoked into
conflicts,'' he said.
''The international mechanism that is called the United Nations now
functions incorrectly, and has become a weapon agaisnt Muslim
countries,'' he said.
''Our enemies think they will be able to annihilate Islam . . . but no
people can eliminate the light of the sun,'' Mustafa Mashhour, deputy
guide of Egypt's fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood, told the meeting.
Palestinians opponents of Yasser Arafat's peace deal with Israel
rubbed shoulders with Brotherhood members inside the hall, as well as
officials and religious movements from Iran, Bosnia, Chechnya and
Algeria.
Tourabi said the conference rejected ''false normalisation'' of
relations with Israel. ''This is a pseudonym for subjugation, and we
choose to call this so-called peace by its real name: submission,'' he
said.

Labour and SNP look to be neck-and-neck -- and at each other's throats
-- in the new West Lothian: Frances Horsburgh, Local Government
Correspondent, reports
IT would be an understatement to suggest there is no love lost between
the leadership of the Scottish National Party and the Labour Party in
West Lothian.
In fact, there is dislike, animosity and lots of plain bad feeling. It
all helps to make the present political struggle to control the new
single-tier council one of the most fiercely fought in the country.
The contest is also one of the most evenly-balanced, and the nails of
every West Lothian candidate will be bitten to the quick by the time the
results are known.
Previously, at the district elections in 1992, the SNP won 11 seats to
Labour's 10 and took over the running of the council. Labour won a seat
back in a by-election, but the two Tories (one recently began styling
herself an Independent Tory) and the one Independent member continued to
hold the balance of power and the SNP stayed in control.
West Lothian takes in Linlithgow, Whitburn and the new town of
Livingston and has a population of about 148,000.
In the Government's original plans, West Lothian, Midlothian and part
of East Lothian were due to merge into a new Lothians council. All the
councils concerned were extremely unhappy with the proposal and it was
widely ridiculed on geographic grounds.
Eventually, after heavy lobbying -- the SNP administration produced
The Case for a West Lothian Council -- Ministers agreed that Mid, West
and East Lothian should stand on their own after reorganisation.
The new council has 27 seats, compared with the present 24, many of
which have new boundaries. Everyone acknowledges that the result will be
a cliffhanger.
Everyone also expects that the election will be decided among the 15
wards which are within the Livingston parliamentary seat. At the end of
the day it could all hinge on a handful of votes in a few seats.
A Labour overall win would be a damaging blow to the SNP, which has
expressed the hope that it can hang on to both West Lothian and the new
council that replaces its other present base in Angus district.
Recently the SNP was instrumental in exposing the fact that Labour's
Terry Coleman had moved to South Shields, in Tyneside, but had not
resigned and was claiming hefty expenses for travelling back and forward
to West Lothian. Mr Coleman's resignation followed swifly.
Labour leader Graeme Morrice insists that the revelations have not
damaged Labour support on the doorsteps, but the SNP makes no bones
about hoping the situation will count as a black mark against its
opponents.
Mr Morrice says that Labour can win 15 to 18 seats on a good night for
them, and he is very optimistic about gaining a working majority.
If, however, Labour was only the largest single party, he says: ''We
will not be dealing with the Tories -- unlike the SNP, who would sell
their grandmothers if it meant they could form an administration.''
Labour has been making much of the SNP's alleged pact with the two
Tory councillors after Labour's by-election win in April 1993, and Mr
Morrice claims it has hurt them with the voters.
The local party is also offering itself as the most experienced when
it comes to running major services, such as education and social work,
by virtue of its participation in the Lothian region Labour
administration. A number of Labour regional councillors are putting
themselves forward to join the new authority.
Mr Morrice accuses the SNP of having ''a Bathgate bunker mentality''
and claims that a Labour-run West Lothian would be much more ready to
form alliances with neighbouring councils such as Edinburgh city to
ensure certain services such as concessionary travel continue after
reorganisation.
In the convener's office Councillor Jimmy McGinley -- known as ''Jimmy
the Chain'' to friend and foe alike since his days as a member of the
council in the Royal Burgh of Linlithgow, where chains and ceremonial
were much in evidence -- says the SNP is fighting on its record in
power.
For example, there have been #10 Christmas bonuses for the pensioners.
West Lothian has a council tax of #91, compared with a Scottish district
average of #170, and both council tax and rents have been frozen for
1995-96.
The convener is also proud to say that, since the SNP took office in
1992, it has spent #25.6m in delivering home improvements to council
tenants, including the modernisation of 2500 post-war homes.
Mr McGinley rejects claims of deals with the two Tories, and insists
it was the actions of the council's only Independent, Jim Walker, that
helped keep the SNP in power in 1993.
He says that one of the major problems which will face the new
all-purpose council will be the state of many schools in the area, which
have up till now been the responsibility of the Labour-run region. ''The
fabric and condition of most of them is shameful.''
The Liberal Democrats are fielding eight candidates in West Lothian
and the Tories 10. One of the Liberal Democrats' biggest targets is Tory
councillor Tom Kerr in Linlithgow.
Mr Kerr likes to refer with a smile to the ''Tory-led SNP
administration'' in West Lothian, and in his election literature refers
to the benefits he claims he has been able to bring Linlithgow's way
because of his key position in the council.
In general, however, West Lothian is pretty barren territory for
Tories, and only in four wards does he expect the party's vote to show
up well.
However, if Tom Kerr and Jim Walker, can win their seats in the St
Michaels and Newlands wards and if the result is as close as everyone
seems to expect, they could both end up once again punching well above
their electoral weight in West Lothian.

A FORMER community worker, who suffered permanent brain damage after
he was struck on the head by a passing car, was yesterday awarded
damages of #187,352.
James Robertson, 32, has undergone a dramatic personality change
following the accident on the Hamilton to Larkhall Road on December 2,
1986.
He sued Frederick Anderson, of Cairnsmore Drive, Stonehouse,
Lanarkshire, who denied responsibility for Mr Robertson's injuries.
In a written judgment, issued at the Court of Session, Lord MacLean
said there was little doubt that Mr Robertson had sustained a very
serious head injury after coming into contact with Mr Anderson's Ford
Escort XR3.
He was travelling in the Orbiston Community minibus, driven by Mrs
Judith Batchelor, a community activities organiser in Strathclyde
Region.
At about 10pm, Mr Robertson got out of the minibus after Mrs Batchelor
heard a rubbing noise. As he was inspecting a wheel, Mrs Batchelor saw a
car coming over the brow of a hill.
It was overtaking and she shouted a warning to Mr Robertson.
The judge said: ''There was then a collision. He appeared to spin and
disappeared from her vision. From the blood on the roadway she realised
that he had sustained a head injury.''
While the injured man was being attended to, Mr Anderson, who had
turned his car at a nearby petrol station, drew up and said: ''I didn't
see him. I thought it was a dog.''
Mr Anderson claimed he had been on his own side of the road when he
passed the minibus when he felt a bump.
Lord MacLean said that there was no doubt that Mr Robertson's head had
come into contact with the external driver's mirror and the windscreen
pillar of the car.
The judge added: ''I am sure that what happened was, that in response
to Mrs Batchelor's shout, Mr Robertson naturally turned his head to see
what was coming.
''Unfortunately, it was just at that moment Mr Anderson's car passed
him, striking him on top of the head and fracturing his skull.
''I do not believe that Mr Anderson was able to carry out the
overtaking manoeuvre, and return to his own side of the road before
passing the minibus in the distance available.
''In my judgment, it was foolhardy of him to overtake when he was
faced with a stationary vehicle, on the opposite carriageway, operating
its hazard lights.
''He passed so close to the minibus that his car struck Mr Robertson,
who was standing in the roadway close to the minibus. I find it proved
that he failed to take reasonable care and he overtook when it was
unsafe to do so.
''It is also in my view, neither here nor there, that the police did
not prefer charges against him. I am surprised, in view of what I
believe and hold to have happened, that they did not.''
The judge also decided Mr Robertson was not to blame.
As a result of the accident, Mr Robertson's personality had
dramatically changed. He was now less confident and lacked motivation,
was at times apathetic and suffered periodically from depression.
He also had difficulty with his short-term memory and impaired
judgment, displayed obsessive behaviour and had some speech difficulty.
At the time of the accident Mr Robertson, who now lives in Babylon
Road, Bellshill, Lanarkshire, was a community worker and had completed a
course in basic youth leader training.

A FOOTBALL fan, who had saved #500 to see Scotland take on Russia, was
turned back at Moscow by immigration officials because of a problem with
his visa.
Railway worker Murray Fraser, 24, of Glenburn Drive, Inverness, had
saved for three months for the trip to see the vital European
Championship clash in Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium.
But officials at Moscow Airport said his visa, which had been issued
by the Russian Consulate in Edinburgh, did not have a necessary stamp.
Despite his pleading with officials for 45 minutes, Mr Fraser was
refused entry, and returned to Britain on the same aircraft, just an
hour after he had touched down.
He said yesterday: ''I sent off #10 for my visa to the Russian
Consulate in Edinburgh six weeks ago. They returned the document and I
thought everything was sorted out.
''But someone has made a mistake and it has cost me a great deal of
money.''
Mr Fraser did manage to get back to London's Gatwick Airport in time
to catch a flight to Scotland, where he saw the match on television.
It was Mr Fraser's second spell of bad luck during the current round
of Championship games.
The night before Scotland were beaten in Athens, he was attacked by
Greek thugs who left him with a broken foot.
But Mr Fraser is undeterred and is now planning a trip next month by
train to see Scotland take on San Marino, the independent republic in
Italy.
He said: ''I just hope that what they say about troubles coming in
threes does not apply to me.''
Mr Fraser has taken the case up with his travel agent in an attempt to
get a refund on his tickets.
A spokeswoman at the Russian Embassy in London said: ''I am sorry, the
visa department is closed in the afternoons. Try again tomorrow.''

A FORMER policeman was convicted at Stirling Sheriff Court yesterday
of separate assaults on two young women who called his taxi for a lift
home.
Joe Boyle, who left the Central Scotland force in the 1980s, was
dismissed by the Stirling cab firm he worked for after one of the women
complained.
The woman told the court that Boyle, a 38-year-old father of three,
demanded a kiss after driving her home last May 18.
She said she was left ''absolutely terrified'' after he attacked her
without warning. She told the court: ''He said 'How about a goodnight
kiss'?'' She said he would not take no for an answer and forced himself
upon her.
She told the court she managed to get out of the car and ran into her
house.She said she was so upset she sat up all night. Later, friends
persuaded her to go to the police.
She phoned a different taxi company to take her from her work to
police headquarters. The cab they sent was again driven by Boyle. When
she refused to get in, Boyle begged another worker to persuade her not
to tell.
The court heard that the case was taken up by Central Scotland
Police's family unit, which specialises in crimes against women and
children.
Constable Cheryle Cowan said she contacted Boyle's boss at Nichol's
Taxis, who told her a complaint had been lodged against Boyle by another
woman.
The second woman told the court that Boyle had offered her a choice of
two ways to pay for a late night journey in his cab -- #1 or a kiss.
She said he then put his arm round her waist and touched her back. She
got out of the cab and threw her fare at Boyle.
Boyle, of Morrison Drive, Bannockburn, denied the offences and said he
had not restrained either woman.
Sheriff Robert Younger found him guilty of assaulting both women. He
called for social enquiry reports and deferred sentence until April 27.

RICHARD Branson's Virgin Group is part of a consortium set to bid for
the Channel 5 licence, it was confirmed yesterday.
Channel 5 will be a new national TV station which could go on air in
early 1997.
The consortium has until May 2 to apply for the last national
terrestrial licence on offer but it is expected to announce plans next
week.
''We have been forming a consortium over the past four months and we
hope to make a bid,'' said a spokesman for the Virgin Group. ''We may
make an announcement in the next few days.''
Virgin chairman Robert Devereaux heads the team working on plans for
the licence.
The consortium also includes HTV, the ITV station for Wales and the
west of England; Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail and
London's Evening Standard; Dutch electronics group Philips; and the
investment company Electra.
Branson, who has four million listeners for the Virgin Radio rock
station he started two years ago, may call the channel Virgin TV if the
application is successful.
The consortium is expected to submit plans for a station with a strong
emphasis on entertainment although a quality news service must also be
an essential part of any serious bid.
Virgin already has considerable TV connections in the independent
production sector -- it owns half of Rapido TV, which makes Jean Paul
Gaultier and Antoine de Caunes' Eurotrash programme.
It also has a stake in NBC's Superchannel and owns post-production
companies.
But the consortium will be competing against at least two other
contenders, including an alliance of media giant Pearson and MAI, the
broadcasting and financial services group.
The Mirror Group is also a bidder, in partnership with US broadcaster
NBC. A third possible rival is Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB.
The successful applicant for the licence, which will cover 70% of the
UK, will have to convince the Independent Television Commission that it
can retune millions of video recorders.
The ITC has never put a figure on how much this is likely to cost the
new licensee, but estimates range from #50m to #100m.

A FORMER steward of Hibernian FC Supporters Association has been
acquitted of embezzlement.
Brian Tritschler, 35, denied taking #17,277 between February and
October 1992.
After six days of evidence in a jury trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court,
Sheriff James Farrell heard arguments from defence advocate Mhairi
Richards and depute-fiscal Ernie Shippin.
In the absence of the jurors he upheld Mrs Richards's submission that
there was no case for Mr Tritschler to answer and formally found him not
guilty.
Sheriff Farrell told the jury yesterday there was no corroborated
evidence to show the original takings of the club during the time Mr
Tritschler was alleged to have been helping himself to cash.
The trial heard earlier that Mr Tritschler and two other full-time bar
staff were sacked after the club treasurer noticed something wrong, and
the accountants confirmed that money was missing.

A DRUNKEN driver whose car mowed down a young father as he pushed his
one-year-old son in his pram was yesterday jailed for five years.
Mr John Stevens, 25, died in Glasgow's Southern General Hospital the
day after being hit by John McDonald on Christmas Day, 1993.
McDonald had drunk a ''substantial'' amount of lager and vodka and got
behind the wheel of his Ford Transit van after watching his children
open their presents.
Mr Stevens's partner, Isobel McNeil, had both legs broken in the crash
but their children, including the baby in the pram, escaped with minor
injuries.
At Dumbarton Sheriff Court, McDonald, 26, admitted causing the death
of Mr Stevens on the A812 Dumbarton-Renton road on December 25 1993, by
driving dangerously.
He also admitted driving the van dangerously, causing it to mount a
pavement and collide with Ms McNeil, and driving while unfit through
drink.
Sheriff Simon Fraser decided that the maximum sentence he could pass
-- three years -- was inadequate and sent Mcdonald to the High Court for
sentencing.
At the sentencing hearing in Edinburgh, Advocate Depute Iain Bonomy
said that Mr Stevens and his family were walking home along an unlit
stretch of road just after 5pm after a visit to relatives in Renton,
Dunbartonshire.
They were walking along the pavement in convoy with Mr Stevens at the
rear pushing the pram.
McDonald had decided to visit his sister in Dumbarton after drinking
vodka and lager. He told the people he was with that he would get a
taxi, but instead got behind the wheel of the van.
The van came up behind the family and mounted the footpath, hitting
his victims before careering across the road, striking a stone wall and
rebounding back over the road.
Mr Stevens was thrown into a field by the impact of the crash.
McDonald, of Dennystown Forge, Dalreoch, Dumbarton, a member of a
travelling family, got out of the van and headed off from the scene of
the accident.
Passers-by were quickly on the scene and police caught up with him
nearby. He was smelling strongly of drink and his speech was slurred.
Mr Andrew Veitch, solicitor-advocate, defending, said that the
incident occurred on a stretch of road that was known as an accident
black-spot.
He added, however: ''I fully accept that if McDonald had not been
drinking this accident would not have occurred. He fully appreciates the
devastating effects on the Stevens family and bitterly regrets he has
been the cause of their grief.''
He explained that McDonald had got up on Christmas morning to watch
his own children unwrap their presents before going out visiting and
stopping off to buy a bottle of vodka. Mcdonald recalled smoking a cigar
but could remember nothing after that.
''He does not remember getting into the van, he does not recall
driving the van, he does not recall the incident happening at all,''
added Mr Veitch.
Because it had been Christmas, McDonald had drunk more than normal and
he had abstained from alcohol since that day.
''If he could change what has happened he would do so,'' said Mr
Veitch.
Jailing McDonald for five years and imposing a ten-year driving ban,
Lord Cameron told him: ''Your unfitness to drive was known to you and on
this occasion you made a deliberate choice to drive in the light of
that, along a road you knew to have hazards on it.''

A CANADIAN who allegedly forced a KLM jumbo jet to divert to Scotland
while en route from Amsterdam to Toronto was released and allowed to
return home with an immigration official escorting him yesterday.
Raymond Reimneitz, 47, from Amherstburg, Ontario, was sent to
Paisley's Dykebar Hospital and gave an undertaking to remain there after
his arrest and appearance in court last month.
But defence solicitor, Mr Paul Lynch, confirmed last night that his
client had now been released from hospital and flown back home to Canada
-- via Amsterdam on a KLM aircraft -- after the airline were given
medical assurances he was fit to fly and did not present a danger to
passengers.
Reimneitz was arrested at Glasgow Airport on February 14. He was
alleged to have conducted himself in a disorderly manner and committed a
breach of the peace on board the Boeing 747 aircraft which was diverted
to Glasgow.
When he appeared on petition, it was claimed he had behaved in
contravention of the Air Navigation Order of 1989 by committing a
reckless or negligent act in a manner likely to endanger the aircraft or
those on board.
It was alleged he forced open the cockpit door, repeatedly entered the
cockpit and demanded that the pilot vacate his seat -- and tried to
speak to passengers on the plane's intercom.
A spokesman for the procurator-fiscal in Paisley confirmed that
Reimneitz had been released on bail and allowed to return home but that
the possibility of a court prosecution was still under consideration.
His solicitor said: ''My client was discharged from hospital last
Friday and declared to be fit to return to Canada.
''The charges have not been dropped, so Mr Reimneitz could be brought
back here to stand trial.
''As he was no longer resident in hospital, he had no place to live
and immigration officers who had kept an interest in him, were keen to
see him returned home.''
Reimneitz flew out of Glasgow at 10.30am yesterday, heading for
Amsterdam for a connecting flight to Toronto.

<HEADLINE>Titaghur chairman may keep Knoydart estate</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
By DAVID ROSS
Highland Correspondent
THE owners of the Knoydart estate, the troubled jute company Titaghur,
could soon be taken over. However, the remote Highland peninsula may not
have seen the last of the company's controversial chairman Reg Brealey.
Shareholders in the company yesterday received a letter from Mr
Brealey, dated March 29. It stated: ''The Board of Titaghur PLC
announces that it is in talks in relation to an offer being made for the
entire issued share capital of the company. A further announcement will
be made as soon as possible.''
This follows Titaghur's stormy annual general meeting in Dundee at the
end of last month when Mr Brealey's brother, Len, called for the fraud
squad to mount an investigation into the company.
The company's accumulated deficit was reported as standing at #67.5m.
It employs 17,000 people at six jute mills near Calcutta and admitted
to being in arrears with its taxes and pension fund payments. An arrest
warrant for Mr Brealey, who is also chairman of Sheffield United, has
been issued by an Indian court in relation to these matters.
Mr Brealey's purchase of 16,500 acres in Knoydart for #1.7m in March
1993 to launch a ''Back to Basics'' adventure training school for
disadvantaged youths was seen by many shareholders as a ludicrous whim.
The idea of a training school also offended many in the community of
less than 50 inhabitants.
Last summer, The Herald revealed that Mr Brealey had not managed to
pay in full Surrey property dealer, Mr Philip Rhodes, for Knoydart and
litigation was being pursued. That still rumbles on and nine estate
workers employed by Titaghur subsidiary, Knoydart Peninsula Ltd (KPL),
have now been waiting nine weeks for their pay.
Colonel Mike Reynolds, who was recruited by Mr Brealey to run the
adventure school and is KPL's managing director, told the Herald
yesterday he had been told the Knoydart workers would receive February's
pay today and their March pay on Tuesday.
He said: ''On the question of the future ownership of Titaghur, it
certainly appears as though there is real interest in taking over the
whole company which would include assets like KPL.
''If that happens I would think the odds of another jute company being
interested in owning somewhere like Knoydart must be pretty slim and so
the likelihood is that it would be hived off. If that was the case, then
it would be a real possibility that Mr Brealey would want to hold on to
Knoydart.''
Col Reynolds said this might be feasible given that Mr Brealey would
have some of the proceeds from the Titaghur sale. He said a lot of
progress had been made in running the estate.
''We are doing quite well on the forestry and stalking side and things
are picking up on the hiring of boats and the letting. We have, however,
a long way to go and we need investment.
''On the training side we have only had a few pilot courses, but I
believe there is still potential there. This would have to be low key
and with the approval of the local inhabitants.''

A FORMER member of a motorcycle display team admitted driving a
motorcycle without a licence and proper insurance when he appeared at
Stonehaven Sheriff Court yesterday.
David Murray, 49, of Station Road, Barry, only realised the error when
he was stopped by police.
The court heard that Murray, who was part of the Royal Artillery's
exhibition squad during the 1970s and left the Armed Forces in 1977, had
applied for a licence to drive cars and motorcycles when his last
licence expired.
''Unfortunately he ommitted to check it properly when it came back and
it only entitled him to drive a car,'' said Murray's lawyer, Mr Dennis
Daun.
''Obviously he is eminently qualified to drive a motor bike having
been part of the motor bike display team at one time,'' he added.
The licensing authority was unable to say who made the error.
Murray, a lorry driver, had been given permission by his brother to
borrow the motorcycle on condition he arranged insurance cover.
''He did this and he was driving the motor bike in the knowledge, as
far as he was concerned, that the insurance was effective,'' said Mr
Daun.
Sheriff Alexander Pollock admonished Murray and imposed six penalty
points on his licence.

THE Scottish hospital at the centre of a necrotising fasciitis scare
has been given a clean bill of health after tests at a London
laboratory.
The results reveal that pensioner Miss Liz Sutherland -- sister of the
former Beirut hostage Mr Tom Sutherland -- did not have the flesh-eating
bug. Falkirk Royal Infirmary officials said she had a similar infection,
and surgeons had to cut away affected tissue.
The tests failed to pinpoint any link between two recent proven cases.
Swab tests on 170 operating theatre and ward staff showed none had signs
of the deadly organism.
Last October, Linda Smith, 29, of Bonnybridge, was hit by the bug days
after giving birth in the hospital by caesarean section. She survived.
Earlier this month, pensioner Gladys McDonald, 69, of Stenhousemuir,
died days after a routine operation. Now her family's demand for an
independent inquiry to allay public fears is being answered.
A bacteriology specialist and a top surgeon in Glasgow will study the
hospital's investigation results and conduct their own inquiry into the
two proven cases.

NUCLEAR Electric, the English and Welsh utility which has been
lobbying to be allowed to take over its smaller neighbour, Scottish
Nuclear, before privatisation, is now insisting privately there would be
no loss of ''Scottishness'' if the deal went through.
But, in a newsletter to its own staff seen by The Herald, Nuclear
Electric admits it may face break-up itself, with its Magnox stations
being transferred to a separate company.
The newsletter warns against a further change advocated by the
industry regulator. That would give two of NE's advanced gas-cooled
reactors (AGRs) to Scottish Nuclear, in a bid to even out competition in
nuclear generation and make the Scottish company big enough to sell off
separately.
''There's no logic in taking two AGRs away from us,'' says the
newsletter from Mark Baker, NE's executive director for corporate
affairs and personnel. It goes on to argue: ''There is a very good case
for merging the AGRs of Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear into one
strong company. That would not damage competition.
''The Scottish AGRs would continue to operate in a Scottish market and
would not add to our market share in the south. It would not involve any
loss of 'Scottishness' since there would be a headquarters in Scotland
which would continue to run the Scottish AGRs.''
The no-loss-of-Scottishness comment will further irk Scottish Nuclear,
which is resolutely fighting the merger idea and privately believes it
may already have seen that threat off.
In a recent internal circular, SN says the creation of a single
nuclear company ''has very little going for it''. NE's promises, echoing
those of Guinness to Distillers in 1986, will stiffen the Scottish
company's resolve to fight off NE's advances.

KVAERNER Govan, the Clyde's last major commercial shipbuilding yard,
yesterday announced a #12.5m order for an oil platform supply vessel for
the North Sea. The supply ship is being built for Stirling Shipping
Company Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Glasgow-based Harrisons
(Clyde) Ltd, and is due for completion by June next year.
The safety-first vessel, designed by Norwegian naval architects, will
operate from Aberdeen and will be manned by a British crew, creating 20
jobs.
Kvaerner's managing director, Mr Kjell Mikalsen, said last night: ''We
are delighted to have concluded this contract. We are currently
completing the fourth of our chemical bulk carrier orders and have just
begun work on the first stage of the British Defence Ministry's
helicopter assault ship.
''The new order could not have come at a more opportune time. This
confirms our belief that we can compete with the best in Europe on any
type of vessel.''
Mr Iain Harrison, chairman of Harrisons (Clyde), added: ''For a time,
price pressures forced us to build many of our vesels overseas. Now
shipbuilders on the Clyde have proved that they can be world-beaters,
and are putting fresh pride into the words 'Clyde-built'.''
Meanwhile, Government-backed negotiations for a #200m order for four
corvettes for the South African navy have reached a critical stage.
Yarrow Shipbuilders and the Spanish Bazan shipyard are to make
presentations to the decision-makers in Pretoria over the next few days
in a move which could offer the Clyde warship-builder and its workforce
a lucrative alternative to Royal Navy contracts.
The Scotstoun yard needs both the South African order and a batch of
three Type-23 frigates for the Royal Navy later this year to maintain a
rolling production programme.
Bids for the RN deal have to be in place by mid-June, with a decision
expected in November. Both Vickers and Vosper-Thorneycroft are also in
the running for the #400m contract.

<TEXT>
A TRUST was launched yesterday to help to refloat the Loch Lomond
steamer Maid of the Loch.
Dumbarton's Labour-controlled district council, who own the ageing
paddle steamer at Balloch Pier, set up the arrangement which will see
the ship released to the trust when funding reaches #200,000.
Councillors decided initially to grant #75,000 to the fund for interim
maintenance, security, and insurance costs. However, the move ran into
troubled water when Tory councillors tried to block the plan. Tory group
leader, Mr Bill Morrison, wanted the council to take no further action
and dispose of the vessel.
An earlier report from retired naval architect, Mr James Donaldson,
had claimed the council would be ill-advised to pour money into the
venture and described the vessel as a wreck.
Concern had also been expressed by the Paddle Steamer Preservation
Society, who said cash from other sources -- including the Heritage
Lottery Fund and the European Regional Development Fund -- would be
difficult to attract if the steamer remained in council ownership.
However, in a report to councillors yesterday, district secretary, Mr
Michael Watter, said if funds were not forthcoming quickly, the cost of
security, insurance, maintenance, and professional fees could exhaust
funds available to the trust, leading to insolvency.
The move by Provost Pat O'Neill finally went through on an 11-5 vote.

PLANTS that give off heat have arrived in Britain. The Herald has
learnt that the first batch allocated to Scotland was being auctioned
early today to members of the horticultural trade at a Customs shed at
Glasgow Airport, following the arrival of a special flight from Caracas.
Specimens of Solar Complexus Americanus will be on sale tomorrow at
garden centres around Scotland. With only 100 plants and keen bidding
for their novelty value, they could fetch #200 or more.
The plant's 1in-thick stems generate spontaneous heat as long as it
has sufficient fluid; with three pints a day a fully-grown plant gives
out as much heat as a 2kw electric fire.
Half a dozen, placed strategically around the house, could replace a
full central-heating system, say energy experts. And you can take them
with you when you move.
Prices are expected to fall sharply as more consignments arrive from
Venezuela in specially insulated aircraft -- which pleases Scottish
pensioners' groups.
''If they do fall to more realstic price levels that old folk can
afford, it will be a boon, keeping them warm and cheerful at the same
time,'' said Linda Martin of Strathclyde Elderly Forum.
The plants, which rapidly grow to a full height of 4ft, sport
attractive pink flowers. Heat output can be controlled by reducing the
amount of water, and in the summer they thrive outdoors.
Professor Olaf Lipro, the Scandinavian botanist who led a British team
to the jungles of Venezuela to investigate native reports of the plant,
says scientists are now looking at a submersible version for constant
hot water. ''But we don't expect to see that before the end of next
year,'' he said in Oslo yesterday.
Prospects of cheap, renewable energy were welcomed by conservationists
last night. ''Millions of domestic plants would create a healthier
environment, countering the greenhouse effect,'' said a spokesman for
Save the Planet.
The political implications will also need to be weighed, as widespread
introduction of Solar Complexus Americanus could dramatically curtail
Government revenue from VAT on domestic fuel.

LEADERS of more than 1.5 million local authority workers are poised to
open another front in the battle over public sector pay.
The pay fight is currently being spearheaded by almost one million NHS
and railway workers. Yesterday thousands of nurses, midwives,
ambulancemen, and other NHS staff staged over 420 demonstrations
throughout Britain to show their anger at the Government's 1% national
offer and rail union bosses spurned British Rail's 2.5% opening offer.
But news that leaders of some 1.5 million local authority workers,
100,000 of them in Scotland, look set to demand the reopening of a
two-stage pay deal, due to trigger increases of a little over 2% from
June, will set the alarm bells ringing in the Treasury.
Last autumn white and blue-collar unions representing local authority
employees accepted a 4.5% two-stage deal involving increases of 1.5%
followed by a further 1.4% plus two lump sums of #100, to be paid
between June this year and April 1996.
With inflation now running at 3.4% there is growing pressure to reopen
the negotiations. Unison is consulting its 860,000 members involved
ahead of a meeting next week of its local government group executive. A
subsequent meeting with the Transport and General Workers' Union and the
General Municipal and Boilermakers will follow.
Meanwhile, following yesterday's lunchtime demonstrations, Unison
urged the Prime Minister to intervene in the health dispute before it
escalates further.
Reacting to a Commons statement by Mr Major that he did not wish to be
unfair to NHS workers, Unison health chief Mr Bob Abberley commented:
''If he does not wish to be unfair . . . and if the money is available
as the Government claims, then the way to bring this dispute to an end
is to give all health service workers their justly deserved pay award
nationally.''
The general-secretaries of Unison, Britain's largest union and the
Royal College of Nursing, the biggest nurses' union, were the key
speakers at a festive demonstration outside London's Great Ormond Street
children's hospital, which delivered serious warnings that NHS workers
might have to resort to industrial action in protest at their pay offer
and in support of the retention of national bargaining.
Unison chief, Mr Alan Jinkinson, stressed that Government attempts to
force through local bargaining for up to 2% above the national offer
could spell the end of the NHS, while the Royal College's Ms Christine
Hancock said that many nurses were already taking action -- by leaving
the service.
Both demanded 3% across the board and said they hoped that industrial
action could be avoided and pledged that, either way, steps would be
taken to ensure that patients would not suffer.
Later, in what are almost certainly its last central negotiations,
British Rail offered its 81,000 workers a pay rise of 2.5% -- almost 1%
below the rate of inflation -- and warned unions it had to keep its
costs down.
The offer was tabled in talks with all the rail unions in reply to
''substantial'' demands. The talks were adjourned.
The train drivers' union Aslef has already sounded out its 15,000
members employed by BR who are said to be overwhelmingly in support of
industrial action to secure a ''substantial increase over and above the
rate of inflation''. The offer on the table would cost BR #30m to
implement.

THE introduction of compulsory tendering in local government has hit
women hardest, the chairwoman of the Equal Opportunities Commission
claimed yesterday.
Ms Kamlesh Bahl said: ''The process has resulted in many women facing
loss of jobs, reduction in hours of work and pay, an increase in
temporary and casual work, and a general worsening of their terms and
conditions of employment.''
Speaking at the launch of a report into compulsory tenders and market
testing in councils, she said: ''This research highlights how important
it is for all legislative and policy proposals to be checked for their
potential adverse impact on either sex, especially women.''
The report claims more women than men had lost jobs or had hours and
pay cuts since tendering was introduced. That meant many female
part-time workers now had weekly earnings below the National Insurance
Lower Earnings Limit and no longer qualified for maternity pay,
statutory sick pay, unemployment benefit, and state pensions.
The report estimates nearly 100,000 women in white-collar and
professional services will be affected by the further extension of
tendering.
The EOC is urging the Government to ensure equal opportunity plays a
role in selection of contractors and wants changes in the National
Insurance system so women do not lose out. It has called on councils to
provide training, implement monitoring systems and develop equality
targets.

THE father of one of the Girl Guides killed when a bus crashed into a
Glasgow bridge yesterday spoke of a ''mockery of justice'' after a court
allowed the bus driver to keep his driving licence.
Campbell Devlin, who was at the wheel of the Clydeside 2000 bus which
crashed into the West Street Bridge on September 18 last year, killing
three Guides and two of their leaders, needed police protection when he
left Glasgow Sheriff Court.
Police feared for the safety of Devlin, of Rannoch Street, Cathcart,
after he was fined #750 and allowed to pay it at #5 a week. He also had
nine penalty points added to his licence after being found guilty of
careless driving.
The security measures followed angry scenes at the sheriff court last
week. Relatives hurled abuse when a jury cleared him of causing the five
deaths by dangerous driving.
But yesterday only a few of them were in the court when Devlin
appeared for sentence, nine days after his conviction.
Sheriff Archibald Bell told Devlin, 30, he had to sentence him for the
severity of his carelessness, but not for its consequences.
Defence advocate Donald Conway said: ''The tragedy will live with Mr
Devlin forever. He will serve his own self-imposed sentence for the rest
of his life.''
He told Sheriff Bell: ''No doubt this is the most distressing case you
have ever had to hear.
''The irony was that Mr Devlin's driving was careful and competent and
painfully slow right up to the moment of the tragedy when he misjudged
the height of the bridge and failed to see two warning signs.''
The Guides where on their way back from a Sunday outing to Butlin's
Wonderworld West at Ayr when the accident happened.
Mr Conway spoke of a ''uniquely bad location'' where there had been 37
accidents in the four years beforehand and seven since. He said that,
despite more signs being erected since the tragedy, accidents had
continued to occur.
Sheriff Bell said he noted that Devlin had suffered mental anguish and
was receiving counselling.
At the trial the jury heard how the bus had its roof ripped off.
Devlin, after viewing the carnage of the upper deck, had held his head
and said: ''Oh no . . . Oh God.''
The dead and dying were Guide leaders Mrs Robina Dougall, 47, of Boon
Drive, Mrs Mary McGreskin, 39, of Drummore Road, and Guides Catherine
McKnight, 10, of Pitmilly Road, Margaret-Ann Riddick, 11, of Bankglen
Road, and Laura Cullen, 10, of Belsyde Avenue, all Drumchapel, Glasgow.
Fifteen other Guides were injured, six of them seriously.
The majority of the relatives were not at court yesterday because they
missed hearing the date set last week in the noise and uproar after the
verdict.
Mr Richard McKnight, whose niece Catherine died in the accident, said:
''This is not justice. I don't feel any pity for this man at all -- five
people are dead. We are considering taking out a private prosecution.''
Catherine's father, Mr Joseph McKnight, added: ''I am totally shocked
at the sentence. It means that Devlin can drive a bus from now. This is
not justice, the whole thing is just a mockery.''

Canon Kenyon Wright, chair of the executive committee, circulated a

particularly the idea that a Scottish Parliament would take power from
local authorities.
His paper says: ''There is a commitment to real 'subsidiarity' which

DJIBOUTI: An estimated 60 gunmen were killed in battles between rival
clan militias in a town in northwestern Somalia, residents said. They
said 50 of the dead in Burao were fighters of the Garhajis clan alliance
and 10 were loyal to Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, leader of the breakaway
republic of Somaliland in the northwest.
They said fighting broke out on Tuesday when Garhajis gunmen attacked
Egal's forces in the town, 75 miles east of Hargeisa, the capital of
Somaliland, which has no international recognition. They said Burao was
deserted yesterday as most residents were hiding indoors, fearing
another rebel attack on the town.

TWO of Glasgow's largest hospital trusts could face prosecution for
allegedly dumping highly dangerous clinical waste in black bin bags
instead of sending it for incineration.
It is claimed that on a number of occasions they sent material which
included body parts, needles, soiled garments, and confidential records
for disposal in open air landfill sites along with domestic rubbish.
The waste, allegedly from Glasgow Royal Infirmary and the Western
Infirmary, was uncovered by employees of a private company sorting
through what they believed to be normal domestic rubbish from the
hospitals.
Environmental health officials have seized large quantities of
material and taken hundreds of photographs as evidence. It is claimed
breaches of the Environmental Protection Act took place on at least 18
separate occasions.
Mr Brian Kelly, director of Glasgow's environmental health department,
said his department had no option but to initiate legal proceedings.
''Acting on information received we investigated how the hospitals
were dealing with their clinical waste stream. We found it was not dealt
with properly. They could not display to us that they have proper
procedures and we are left with no alternative but to prosecute them. We
are in the process of referring papers to the procurator-fiscal.''
The Health and Safety Executive is also considering legal proceedings
against the trusts under the Health and Safety at Work Act. Mr Stewart
Campbell, area director, said: ''We will be looking at the part of the
Act which deals with employers' duties to others outside their
employment. But at the moment we have a secondary role to the district
council.''
Earlier this year senior trust officials were summoned to a meeting in
the City Chambers, shown evidence of the problem, and warned to take
steps to stop it recurring.
The material was discovered by employees of UK Waste Ltd., the company
contracted by the hospital trusts to deal with their domestic refuse.
Mr David Boyd, industrial affairs manager for UK Waste Ltd., said
yesterday: ''We had known of this problem for some time and expressed
great concern over it. We have workers to protect and waste has to be
handled properly.''
A spokesman for Glasgow Royal Infirmary University NHS Trust confirmed
there had been breaches in the trust's own waste disposal policy and
said all waste, including domestic, was now incinerated.
He said: ''We dispose of around 10 tonnes of domestic waste and five
tonnes of clinical waste each day, which represents many hundreds of
plastic bags. We have very clearly laid-down procedures for the disposal
of different types of waste from our hospitals.
''Since Christmas, environmental health officers have informed us of
breaches of our own policy. We have been told by the district council's
environmental health department that they intend to make a report to the
procurator-fiscal.''
He said that after the council report they have acted to prevent any
breaches of policy, and they now incinerate all waste.
A spokeswoman for the West Glasgow Hospitals University Trust
confirmed they were aware of seven alleged breaches, but claimed
clinical waste was sent wrongly for processing only once. Other
occasions involved staff errors where domestic waste was put in yellow
clinical waste bags.
A spokeswoman for Greater Glasgow Health Board said the board had been
aware of the issue. ''We have been working with the two trusts to
improve matters,'' she said.
''We don't have any powers to compel them to do anything about the
problem. But what we have done is investigate the difficulties they have
been having and make recommendations about how they can be resolved
including consulting a specialist on waste disposal.''

United Nations, Thursday,
THE Security Council made no changes in sanctions it imposed on Libya
in connection with the 1988 bombing of PanAm flight 103 over Lockerbie
but the United States urged an oil embargo and said it was tightening
its own unilateral curbs.
Sanctions were first clamped on Libya in 1992 for failing to surrender
for trial in Britain or the United States two alleged Libyan
intelligence agents accused of having planted a bomb on the jumbo jet.
US ambassador Madeleine Albright called on fellow council members,
during a periodic 120-day review of existing punitive measures, to
''consider tougher economic sanctions, including an oil embargo''.
She also said the United States was strengthening its own unilateral
measures against Libya and urged others to do so.
Albright said the United States would review its licensing policies on
re-exports of US goods already on the restricted list to Libya and would
''request that all U.S. companies ask their foreign-based subsidiaries
to cease all trade with Libya.''
The White House said on Monday it would try to win support for
stepped-up measures, including an oil ban, but there has been little
backing in the past for such action.
Several European countries are importers of Libyan oil, including
Germany and Italy, both council members, and Spain.
The FBI said last week it had placed the two Libyans, Abdel Basset Ali
Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhima, on its ''10 Most Wanted Fugitives''
list and offered a $4m reward for information leading to their arrest.
Libyan UN envoy Mohamed Azwai told reporters there was clear evidence
his country was not responsible for the Lockerbie bombing, adding: ''We
are very confident that in a neutral trial, we will win.''

Washington, Thursday
THE FBI has launched a criminal investigation into allegations that US
intelligence agencies shredded records to cover up knowledge of two
murders in Guatemala, the US Justice Department said.
''We do have an FBI inquiry into the allegations of destruction of
records'' by the super-secret National Security Agency and US Army
intelligence, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick told reporters.
Her comments came after the White House announced that President
Clinton had ordered a sweeping review of the US Government role in the
two deaths allegedly ordered by a Guatemalan colonel who had been a CIA
informer.
Clinton ordered the Intelligence Oversight Board to review ''any and
all aspects'' of the killings of Guatemalan innkeeper Michael DeVine, a
US citizen, in 1990, and leftist guerrilla commander Efrain Bamaca
Velasquez, husband of an American lawyer, in 1992.
The White House said the review also covers the killing or
mistreatment of other Americans in Guatemala, including the torture of
Sister Dianna Ortiz in 1989 and the 1985 shooting deaths by military of
photographer Griffith Davis and free-lance journalist Nicholas Blake.
Gorelick said the FBI inquiry began after Representative Robert
Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, sent a letter to the administration
this week about allegations made to him by an anonymous NSA employee.
The employee charged that the Army and the NSA, which conducts
electronic surveillance, may have known about the two murders when they
occurred and then tried to conceal their knowledge by shredding
documents.
Another top Justice Department official said steps had been taken to
prevent the destruction of records.

HEALTH service unions yesterday renewed a warning that nursing staff
across Scotland could strike over pay by the summer.
They lobbied the Scottish Office over the offer of 1% plus local deals
made to all NHS hospital staff.
Lunch-hour rallies were held at hospitals across Scotland.
A demonstration was also held in Perth where the SNP candidate for the
Perth and Kinross seat, Ms Roseanna Cunningham, called the pay deal
''insulting and unfair''.
Maria Fyfe, Shadow Health Minister, and Mo Mowlem, Shadow Northern
Ireland Minister, addressed 200 at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.
The unions claim the offer is worth a doughnut a day to a domestic
(25p), a bag of peanuts to an operating department assistant (34p), and
a bar of nut chocolate to a ward sister (55p).
Unison spokesman John Lambie said: ''One per cent is a derisory offer
and that is demonstrated by the purchasing power of the wage increase.
Unless the Government come to their senses then we will be proceeding to
a consultative ballot of all members. If they reject the present offer,
we will then immediately ballot for industrial action.''
Mr Lambie said the unions would embark on a month-long consultation
and if health workers favoured industrial action, strike action could be
on the cards from the beginning of May.
The Government claims that another 2% can be negotiated with local
managements.
Mr Lambie said: ''Members have every right to feel suspicious of local
bargaining. Where local bargaining has taken place before, it has
resulted in reductions in staffing levels and terms and conditions of
employment.''
Staff taking part in a demonstration outside the Scottish Office,
where Unison later had ''useful'' talks with senior NHS personnel, said
they would seriously consider striking for better pay.
Mrs Dorothy Melrose, 43, a nursing assistant at the Western General
Hospital in Edinburgh, said the increase on the table was currently
worth only 24p a week to her. ''I think it's an insult to all nurses. I
would be prepared to strike,'' she said.

A BOY of 14 at the centre of an imprisonment controversy could have
spent his final night in Porterfield jail.
The boy's lawyers had failed in a bid to get him bail at Tain Sheriff
Court yesterday.
But later, Highland Regional Council's social work director, Mr Jim
Dick, said: ''We have found a place for the lad in a secure unit in
Angus.
''We are, this very minute, applying for the court's permission to
transfer him there from prison immediately. Hopefully this will be a
formality, and the boy will be driven there by social workers tonight.''
Earlier, the teenager, who is accused of raping a girl of the same age
in a children's home where both were residents, made a second appearance
in private at Tain Sheriff Court.
The youngster was driven the 40 miles to court from Inverness in a
police van.
His solicitor, Mrs Angela Simpson, pleaded in vain for bail and the
teenager was remanded back to prison.

CHILDREN aged under five learn better under Labour, Scottish Labour's
education spokesperson claimed in Edinburgh yesterday.
Visiting Royston Primary School in the city's Pilton area, Mrs Maria
Fyfe pointed to the record of Labour-controlled Lothian Regional Council
in providing nursery places for every four-year-old in the region.
Mrs Fyfe said she would like every four-year-old in Scotland to be
offered a nursery place by the end of the first term of the new local
authorities and pledged herself to work with Labour councils to achieve
this.
She said the Tories had made promises in nursery education but had yet
to deliver.
Dr Marjorie Mowlam, a member of the Shadow Cabinet, said that what
children learned before their fifth birthday was important to later
development and the benefits of nursery education were indisputable.

<TEXT>
A WRIT is expected to be served in the Court of Session today in an
attempt to stop Labour-controlled Central Regional Council from
privatising four publicly-owned business parks.
Falkirk District Council, also Labour controlled, is seeking a
judicial review of the region's plans to set up a joint venture company
to own and operate the four parks, probably in conjunction with
developers John Laing.
The planned sell-off, expected to raise #30m, has caused a rift in
Labour ranks only days before the elections for the new unitary
councils. It is being opposed by all three district councils in the
region.
A spokesman for Stirling District Council -- which is Tory controlled
-- said legal officers from the three districts had agreed a domino
approach to action in the Court of Session.
If Falkirk's writ fails today , Stirling will serve another and if
that fails, Clackmannan will follow suit.
Labour group leaders from all three districts faxed the leader of the
regional council, Mr Corrie McChord, before the closed-doors meeting
which agreed the sell-off on Wednesday.
The fax expressed astonishment at the plan, which it called ''selling
off the family silver''.
The opposition Labour group on Stirling District Council appeared to
have back-pedalled last night, after its leader Gillie Thomson said he
received a promise of consultations.
He said the group was keeping an open mind and he said he understood
that the region's decsion was not quite final.
Labour leader of Falkirk District Council, Dennis Goldie, said the
sell-off decision had taken everyone very much by surprise.
He said: ''There has been very scant information given to us, very
little dialogue between officers and no communication between
councillors.''
Under the planned deal, Central Region would own 50% of the new joint
venture company, with councillors being represented on a new joint
venture board.
Defending the decision, Councillor McChord said the plan was simply
the best way to continue to create jobs and wealth.
The row was seized by SNP leader Alex Salmond, who called on Shadow
Scottish Secretary George Robertson to explain what he called ''humbug
and hypocrisy'' over the issue.
He said Mr Robertson had specifically and repeatedly attacked
SNP-controlled Grampian Region for taking exactly the measures.

THE armed Incident Response Vehicle which has been used by Scotland's
second biggest police force on a trial basis is to be brought into full
service.
It is one of a package of measures being implemented by Lothian and
Borders police to combat violent crimes or volatile situations.
Other moves include the purchase of 1000 additional side-handled
batons -- a defensive weapon seen as giving officers more protection --
and a similar number of ''speed cuffs.''
The measures were revealed by Chief Constable Sir William Sutherland
who yesterday promised resources to combat violence.
One example of the violence was the case earlier this year of three
men who were jailed for life for shooting to death elderly Bonnyrigg man
Mr David Dunn who intervened to prevent their escape after a payroll
robbery in the town.
Even as Sir William unveiled the package of measures, the IRP, crewed
by a highly-trained team -- a driver and two specialist firearms
officers -- was called to deal with an incident in the Borders.
In his annual report, Sir William said that while crime had been
reduced due to a coalition between police and public, its nature had
altered.
''During the year, the first armed response vehicle began regular
patrols. It is a matter of regret that this step has proved necessary
but the protection of the public is paramount.''
In his report -- in which he paid tribute to Mr Dunn's courage -- he
said that last year, the overall crime level had dropped by 6%.
Among positive aspects were reductions in housebreakings, recorded
drug offences and road fatalites.
However, the report showed a 10% rise in the number of serious
assaults, including domestic ones.
''It is a matter of concern where crime is falling that serious
assaults are going up. We have to look at our tactics and policies for
dealing with them.''
The report also detailed the first conviction of a ''crack'' cocaine
dealer in Scotland after an underground operation at an Ingliston rave.
However, he said use of the drug appeared to be minimal.
''I am pleased that our high profile policing of a number of raves
contained the potentially volatile and sometimes tragic consequences
which can follow these events.''
The Chief Constable, who believes camera technology will be developed
''when it can be afforded'', has urged the Government to make camera
detection systems self-funding by allowing the police and local
authorities to invest money from fines in more cameras and
administrative support.
Sir William forecast that 1995 would be a difficult one in view of
financial restraints.
The Chief Constable said, however, that he did not want cutbacks in
street patrols at known ''hotspots'' in the force area such as central
areas of Edinburgh like Lothian Road and Haymarket.

<TEXT>
POLICE officers, vets, and animal cruelty inspectors who raided a
Renfrewshire dairy farm found half of the herd suffering from lack of
proper care and attention, Paisley Sheriff Court heard yesterday.
The court was told officers also found an open pit containing the
carcasses of ten cattle and seven calves lying rotting in a rat-infested
open pit.
SSPCA inspector, Mr John Wilson, described how he and his colleagues,
including Department of Agriculture animal welfare experts, took a video
film as evidence.
Sheriff Charles Stoddart watched the film taken during the visit to
Barrodger Farm near Lochwinnoch last May as Mr Wilson explained 50 to 60
cattle had problems associated with overgrown hooves. Some had weeping
sores, infections on their backs and sides, and swelling. Others were
lame, emaciated, and showing signs of muscle wastage.
After warning the farmer, Mr John Harper, 53, to call in veterinary
assistance, he returned a week later and found three animals
deteriorated so badly they had to be destroyed.
Mr Harper pled not guilty to causing unecessary suffering or distress
to livestock; knowingly allowing carcasses to remain unburied in a
manner which would have allowed dogs access; causing suffering to two
cows and a bullock by failing to provide adequate care of veterinary
attention; causing a cow to be transported while it was unfit,
abandoning it in a field in a manner likely to cause unecessary
suffering; failing to dispose of animal by-product by burial; and

THE former Tory MP for Cheltenham, Sir Charles Irving, died early
yesterday after a long battle against illness.
He had always been adamant about not disclosing his age, although he
was believed to have been born in 1926.
He began his career as a hotel kitchen boy and became Mayor of
Cheltenham three times.
He became an MP in 1974, retiring from the Commons at the 1992
election.
A hard-working campaigner for reform in prisons, he helped to found
the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders.

POLICE were last night hunting an armed man and at least two
companions after a raid on a house on a farm near Kelso in the Borders.
The men got away with silverware after a masked intruder, holding what
is thought to have been a single-barrelled shotgun, appeared at the
bedside of a retired headmaster and ordered him not to move.
The raider then joined two others, whose voices the occupant of the
house, on Fairnington Farm, could hear coming from downstairs. The
householder later found that a substantial quantity of silverware was
missing.
An armed incident response vehicle was among the units deployed to the
area.
The occupant, who is not being named by police, was unharmed.
The raid took place about midday. Police appealed for anyone who saw
anything suspicious to contact them.

PLANNING refusal for a housing development on green-belt land in East
Kilbride has been upheld by the Scottish Office.
Ayr-based John Lynch (Builders) Ltd wanted to build 350 to 400 houses
next to a grade A-listed Mains Castle, in Stewartfield.
East Kilbride District Council opposed the development in 1993. After
a public meeting the plan was firmly rejected.
But the developers appealed and last year the Scottish Secretary, Mr
Ian Lang, appointed a planning reporter to investigate.
Mr Lang announced yesterday that the development would encroach on a
nearby village and proposed heritage park.
District councillor Harry Winslow later said that the environmental
impact of the scheme would have been severe. He added: ''This is a great
victory for the council and the East Kilbride community.''
No-one was available for comment at the building company last night.
It is not known if it plans to appeal to the Court of Session.

THIRTEEN MPs have backed motions in the House of Commons demanding a
public inquiry into the mysterious death of Nationalist activist, Mr
Willie McRae.
Their concern has been aroused by the series of revelations in The
Herald this week which have questioned the official accounts of how the
Glasgow lawyer allegedly shot himself.
Friends of Mr McRae have frequently speculated in the 10 years since
his death that he had been under surveillance by Special Branch
officers, and some believe he was murdered.
On Tuesday, Glasgow Labour MP George Galloway signed an Early Day
Motion expressing disquiet over the new evidence emerging about the
death and calling on the Lord Advocate to order an inquiry into the
shooting. He was backed by nine other MPs, including Shadow Scottish
spokesman John McAllion and four English MPs.
On Wednesday the SNP parliamentary group of three MPs signed a similar
motion, again requesting that the Lord Advocate reconsider the previous
decision not to order a public inquiry.
SNP parliamentary leader Mrs Margaret Ewing said last night: ''As this
matter continues to linger I feel we have got to bring it to some kind
of resolution.''
Early Day Motions are not debated in the House, but give MPs an
opportunity to express their views on current issues.

A WREN who was forced to resign from the Royal Navy nine years ago
when she became pregnant rejoined the Senior Service yesterday.
After signing on the dotted line and being issued with her new
uniform, Mrs Donna Ward said: ''I feel absolutely wonderful. It's
brilliant.''
The 33-year-old had to leave the Navy when she became pregnant with
her son James.
Since then, she has had two more children, Aaron, six, and Natasha,
four.
Mrs Ward described the day that she was forced to leave as
''devastating''.
However, she fought to return and was backed by her husband, Alan, who
is also in the Navy.
Last November, an industrial tribunal ordered her reinstatement and
awarded #2000 compensation.
Yesterday she walked through the gates of HMS Nelson at Portsmouth
with her husband and children to rejoin.
In an emotional moment, Aaron gave his mother a hug.
''Mummy's going to become a sailor again,'' said one of the children
-- and then Mrs Ward went to complete the necessary documentation before
reporting to the clothing store to collect her kit.
Mrs Ward, who is to start work as a Wren steward at the shore base HMS
Dryad, said: ''It's brilliant. The whole nine years have suddenly flown
past and all the emotions have come together in a great crescendo.''

SCOTTISH Chambers of Commerce yesterday urged the Government to carry
out a fundamental review of transport policy.
Delegates to the Getting Scotland Moving conference spoke of their
frustration at being unable to compete on a level playing field in the
European single market.
They also highlighted the limitations and deficiencies of existing
infrastructure, and demanded improvements that would help them assist in
Scotland's economic recovery.
Mr Charles Winter, deputy president of British Chambers of Commerce,
said an integrated transport policy was desperately needed, and called
on conference ''to express anger at the chaotic situation''.
Prominent businessmen, including CalMac managing director Colin
Paterson; Mr Matthew Hudson, chairman of Prestwick International
Airport; and ScotRail director John Ellis, took part in workshops to
address the needs of firms deeply worried by the Government's alleged
laissez-faire approach to transport strategy.
Next month, the chambers, having digested the complaints, will produce
a document which they want incorporated into a Government transport
manifesto ''if support of the Scottish business community is to be
retained''.
The report will call for road, rail, sea, and air links to be truly
integrated. It will also include demands for a series of upgradings,
including the west coast main line, the A9, and a rail link to Glasgow
Airport.
However, officials last night stressed that the Government would not
be asked to spend, spend, spend. They believe the private sector will be
able to fund and operate many projects.
That message was hammered home by Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of
Eurotunnel.
He chairs the Treasury's Private Finance Panel, which wants the
private sector to provide the funds and expertise for services
traditionally regarded as the exclusive domain of the public sector.
He estimated that firms had more than #20bn to spend on some 700
projects, and were prepared to meet operating costs valued at #300bn in
return for the future profits from franchises.
However, he suggested progress in improving the nation's transport
infrastructure had gone backwards since 1989, particularly on road and
rail improvements designed to speed links to the Channel tunnel.
Sir Alastair dismissed British Rail's privatisation as a fragmentation
in reality, because the pieces -- including Railtrack and the train
operating units still required Government subsidy to survive.
But he stressed that the ''Piggyback'' rail-freight wagons scheme,
which could bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland, would never
have got off the ground but for Railtrack.
Piggyback -- trucks on trains -- is a crucial part of Scottish
Enterprise's strategy to upgrade Scotland's transport links into Europe.
The system has operated successfully on the Continent and the US for
years, but its introduction to Britain has been hindered because rail
bridges and tunnels are lower or narrower than those in Europe.
Previous studies put the cost of infrastructure changes in the
billions to run the wagons on the west coast main line between Glasgow
and London and onwards to the Channel tunnel.
However, Railtrack has accepted a #100m figure by the Piggyback
Consortium, which embraces the private and public sector.
Rosyth-based Babcock Rail Ltd this week won a contract to build
prototype wagons, and their success is the key to obtaining the funding
necessary for altering the line.
If all goes well, a Piggyback service would be up and running between
Glasgow and London by January. Further upgrading of track would allow a
full service from the Mossend Euro terminal in Lanarkshire to the
Continent in 1997.
The spin-off for Babcock, which beat off stiff competition from
Slovaks and Germans to modify Thrall wagons, would be to build some 3000
units under a #40m contract over five years, creating 50 jobs.
Sir Alastair urged Scots to do business in Europe, where economies are
now becoming integrated.
He said Eurotunnel was increasing train frequencies, and that Eurostar
sleepers from Edinburgh-Glasgow to Paris would begin next year.
Delegates were also asked to ensure that road links south, which he
described as dreadful, were improved.
The Herald's economics editor, Alf Young, warned that the Government
and Opposition would not listen to the conference if it made demands
without coming up with realistic funding proposals.
He also argued that firms would run a mile if there was an increase in
corporation tax to meet the costs.
Mr Young said there could be a growing, hostile mood in the
non-business community against developments -- as evidenced by the M77
or Ayrshire pylon protests.

<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979124532</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
PLANS to introduce a #700m hi-tech train safety scheme throughout the
rail network were scrapped by the Government yesterday on grounds of
cost.
The decision was taken by Transport Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney,
despite a recommendation in the 1988 Clapham rail accident report that
the system be fully used on British Rail.
The scheme is known as automatic train protection -- an in-cab system
which ensures trains cannot pass a signal at red and keeps speeds within
the permitted limit.
Dr Mawhinney said yesterday that he agreed with the advice of British
Rail, Railtrack and the Health and Safety Commission that fitting ATP
throughout the network ''cannot be justified because the costs far
outweigh the benefits''.
His decision was immediately attacked by Shadow Transport Secretary Mr
Michael Meacher, who said the Government had repeatedly promised an
introduction of the system ever since the Clapham crash which claimed 35
lives.
In his Clapham report, Mr Justice Hidden recommended ATP should be
fully implemented within five years of a specific type of system being
selected.
In 1990, an official report said the March, 1989, Purley rail crash --
in which five people died and 88 were injured -- could have been
prevented by ATP.
Trials of an ATP system started on two lines -- Paddington to Bristol
and Marylebone to Aylesbury and Banbury -- in 1991.
In a parliamentary written answer yesterday, Dr Mawhinney said the
system would continue on the two trial lines and would also be put in
use on the Heathrow Express Link and, eventually, on the Channel Tunnel
high-speed rail link.
He also announced that on the basis of advice he had received from the
HSC, he concluded that ATP measures might be justified on parts of the
rail network.
''Serious railway accidents are relatively rare, and there has been a
significant improvement in railway safety in recent years,'' said Dr
Mawhinney.
He added: ''Accidents involving signals passed at danger, overspeeding
and buffer stop collisions, which ATP would prevent, are infrequent and
account for about 3% of fatalities and injuries (excluding trespassers
and suicides).''
Dr Mawhinney continued: ''British Rail and Railtrack have advised me
that network-wide fitment of ATP as piloted is not justifiable because
the costs far outweigh the benefits.
''The HSC has endorsed this view and, furthermore, considers that
there are alternative safety investments which would be likely to yield
greater effectiveness in terms of lives saved, and better value for
money.''
Mr Meacher said: ''Because the issue of rail safety has gone off the
boil, the Government have backed off from a constantly-reiterated
pledge.
''We question the Government's view of the cost of implementing the
scheme. But, even if it is as high as #700m, this is only just over half
of what the Government has already squandered on rail privatisation.
They prefer to keep money back for tax cuts before an election rather
than saving lives.''

SCOTLAND'S hallmark system on gold and silver has been reprieved.
The Government performed a last minute U-turn and decided to support
moves to keep the 500-year tradition alive.
It had been put under threat by a German-led motion at the European
Union yesterday which would have had it scrapped. An Edinburgh Castle
symbol has been used on gold items and the lion rampant on sterling
silver since 1473 to signify they had been checked independently in
Scotland.
The hallmarking and verifying of the metals is carried out by the
Assay Office in Edinburgh. All imported jewellery must also pass through
the Assay Office for inspection and stamping before it can be sold to
consumers.
Mr Michael Laing, chairman of the Assay Office in Edinburgh, expressed
delight at the Government U-turn. He said: ''There was a meeting with
Assay Office representatives and the Board of Trade in London the day
before the vote and they seemed to accept that the hallmark system
should be kept.
''The hallmarking system on gold and silver is part of Scotland's
heritage and is also an important independent consumer check.''
Consumer Affairs Minister Earl Ferrers said the UK could not accept a
European-wide system of identifying the quality of gold and silver which
fell below well-established and exacting national standards. ''Hallmarks
are a great form of consumer protection,'' he said after talks in
Brussels. ''Anything less is unacceptable.''
The Germans, who allow manufacturers to stamp their own products,
wanted an EU system based on its national arrangements. Lord Ferrers
warned that could increase the prospect of misleading information and
would be a significant reduction in consumer safeguards in Britain.
He added: ''The fact is that Germany's standards are too low for us
and ours are too high for Germany. In common parlance we are between a
rock and a hard place.''
Several consumer Ministers from other member states complained that
Britain's hallmarking system was too bureaucratic and unnecessary but
Ireland, Holland, Portugal and Austria supported the UK.
Consumer Ministers did agree on separate legislation tightening up EU
food labelling laws. In future manufacturers will have to include more
information on ingredients and contents.

THE Prime Minister is embarking on a strategy this weekend to launch
himself to beat Labour leader Tony Blair's campaign to capture the
middle class vote.
Yesterday Mr Major told the Commons that he will use the British veto
if necessary to prevent the European Union imposing economic sanctions
on Canada in its fishing war with Spain. Tomorrow he goes to Birmingham
to rally the Tory activists and persuade them that election defeat is
not inevitable in two years' time.
On Sunday night, before he flies to Washington, he will record a
40-minute BBC Panorama interview for screening on Monday, in which he
intends to set out a fresh vision for a revived Britain over the next
two years.
Earlier this week, in a strategic interview in the Daily Telegraph, Mr
Major asserted that he would fight any challenge to his leadership and
that he had no intention of giving up No 10 at this low threshold of
Tory fortunes.
The whole exercise over the next few days is designed to reassert the
authority of the Prime Minister.
Yesterday's German reduction in interest rates provides additional
sparkle to the Prime Minister's insistence that things are coming good.
But the atrocious polling by the Tories, who are now expecting to lose
1200 seats in the local authority elections, is still dragging the
Government down.
Today the Tory Central Council meets in Birmingham to hear a phalanx
of Government Ministers reassert ''core Tory values'' in an attempt to
regain the confidence of the Tory middle class. Law and order, Europe
and the economy are to be the key themes. Mr Blair will be painted as
the man who threatens to break up the constitution, with his plans for
devolution and abolishing the House of Lords.
The opposition parties are concerned that Mr Major might succeed in
reasserting his authority and pulling off a publicity coup in the
build-up to the local elections in Scotland and south of the Border.
They are protesting to the BBC that, in giving the Prime Minister a
40-minute set piece TV interview on Monday night, they are giving the
Tories a political advantage. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's broadcasting
spokesman, called for equal time for Mr Blair, Lib-Dem leader Paddy
Ashdown, and the Nationalist leader, Alex Salmond, or at least equal
billing on the same programme.

THE SNP returned to the offensive on their record in helping the
elderly with help with fuel bills during cold weather, claiming at a
news conference in Perth that Labour's record was ''utterly shameful''.
Party leader Alex Salmond said their Warm Up For Winter packages were
outstanding examples of local public service and Labour had blundered in
opposing schemes in Grampian, Tayside and Central Region.
''Labour have spent all winter playing petty party political games
over the vitally-important issue of fuel poverty in energy-rich
Scotland,'' he said. ''Attacking and harrying hard-working SNP
councillors has been their one and only motive. Their shameful behaviour
deserves that condemnation of the voting public on April 6.''
Prospective SNP candidate for Perth and Kinross Roseanna Cunningham
said those who had benefited from the schemes had been full of praise
for them.
She said: ''Labour's problems in these elections is that the people of
Scotland aren't as stupid as Labour clearly think they are. They know
the difference between Labour's opportunism and the SNP's delivery of
first class services.''
SNP deputy leader Dr Allan Macartney, MEP, said one aspect of the
Tayside scheme which had reaped dividends was special training for home
helps so they could advise people of their full benefit entitlements.
''A potential #1m per annum in unclaimed benefits has been identified
as a direct result of Warm Up For Winter,'' he said.
He added that a Freephone benefits advice service operated as part of
the scheme in Grampian had also produced good results.
At a press conference in Edinburgh the SNP pledged that they would
keep up their job creation efforts under single-tier authorities.

EXCLUSIVE
A 75-YEAR-OLD SNP candidate was sent to Barlinnie yesterday after he
gave himself up to police. As he started a seven-day sentence for
refusing to pay #150 road tax to ''an English Treasury'', Mr William
Gilmour knew that he had not surrendered his principles.
Mr Gilmour, of Cumbernauld, who is standing as SNP candidate for
Tannochside in the new North Lanarkshire authority, had been warned by
the courts that he faced going to prison if he did not pay the back
duty.
He had written to Scottish Secretary Ian Lang offering to pay the
money to a Scottish recipient but had been told by the Scottish Office's
criminal justice section that the Vehicle Excise and Regulation Act 1994
provided that vehicle excise and penalties for related offences were
payable to the Exchequer.
Mr Gilmour who maintains the Treaty of Union is not legal, spent
yesterday morning in his small terrace house preparing to give himself
up to police.
As he sipped a cup of home-made beer to fortify himself for the
ordeal, he said: ''Two policemen came to arrest me on Wednesday but I
asked them if they could come back after polling day so I could fight
the election. They went away but came back 15 minutes later and said I
would have to give myself up at 11.00am today.
''After five years of the Second World War, a week in Barlinnie will
seem like nothing. Maybe I'm a masochist but I am looking forward to it
in a way. I will take a book and keep a diary.''
Mr Gilmour said it would be the second time he had been in Barlinnie.
On the first occasion he had visited prison as a Justice of the Peace.
He had, he said, been drummed off the bench for being naughty.
A widower, Mr Gilmour has one son, three grandsons, and three
great-grandchildren. As he sat nursing his home-brew in his small living
room where a piano, TV, computer, and three-piece suite jostle for
space, their pictures smiled down at him from the chimney-breast. Next
to them hangs a picture of Robert the Bruce. Dressed in chainmail, Bruce
stands at prayer, no doubt for another man who is about to champion
Scotland.
Mr Gilmour said: ''My son didn't say so in so many words but he thinks
I'm off my head. I told him not to go and do anything daft like paying
the back tax. It's just the kind of thing he would do.
''He thinks I'm taking it to extremes, but I have been involved with
the SNP for 30 years and know that the chances of getting Westminster to
move on devolution will not come through ordinary parliamentary means.
If enough of us are in prison they will think we are serious about it.''
Going to Barlinnie would, he said, be a wee bit like going to war.
''You don't know what's ahead but I would have been disappointed if
things had turned out differently after being keyed up for going to
prison. With time off for good behaviour, I expect to be out on
Monday.''
Mr Gilmour expects to pass his time in the prison hospital. ''I am on
two types of medication. I am being treated for what felt like a
threatened cerebral haemorrhage. I was taking bad turns at the time and
was prescribed two kinds of tablets. But I feel champion now.''
Tannochside will be Mr Gilmour's third election. ''I have won both
times I have stood before. I hope the sound of a patriot appeals to the
electors of Tannochside.
''I haven't managed to do much canvassing as yet but I will be over
there right away when I'm released. I hope I will be able to get some
electioneering done from Barlinnie. Tommy Sheridan was given election
facilities when he was inside so I hope the same courtesy will be
extended to me.''
As he prepared to leave his home Mr Gilmour gathered up two plastic
bags, one with toiletries, the other crammed with underwear and an SNP
logo.
He said: ''I've had offers from people in Spain and Australia to come
and stay with them so I wouldn't have to go to prison. But I'm not going
to run away like a hunted animal.''
As he checked his living room for the final time his eyes were drawn
to a Kenneth McKellar record sleeve. ''I'm learning to sing'', he said,
and like Kenneth McKellar I'll keep right on to the end of the road till
Scots get their independence.''
An SNP spokesman said last night: ''We don't encourage such protests.
However, there is something far wrong with a system which allows the
jailing of a 75-year-old man for what is a technical offence and part of
a honourbale protest on a matter of conscience.''

BRITAIN appeared to be winning the diplomatic war in the fisheries
dispute last night, as European Union officials delayed moves towards
imposing sanctions against Canada.
But UK-inspired resistance to a trade war infuriated the Spanish, who
accused the UK of being isolated on the issue. Spain also demanded that
any further infringement of international law by the Canadians should
immediately trigger sanctions against Ottawa.
The Prime Minister offered strong support for Canada in its fish war
with Spain. He was cheered loudly by Conservative MPs when he told the
Commons he believed the Canadians were quite right to take a strong line
on enforcement.
Mr Major also promised that he would ''strongly oppose'' trade
sanctions which some EU members have been threatening, but said he
believed ''we are close to a deal'' in the dispute which has become
increasingly bitter.
He was responding to an appeal from Mr David Harris, MP for the
Cornish fishing constituency of St Ives, ''to take a personal lead in
this matter and try and bring some sanity back into the question of fish
stocks and ensure that fishermen have a future to look forward to''.
Mr Major said tough enforcement laws were needed and backed Canada's
call for proper enforcement. But he hoped the Canadians would not
''undermine their own good case'' -- an apparent reference to their
action on Sunday in cutting the nets of a Spanish fishing boat. Her crew
claimed they were placed in danger.
In Brussels, the European Commission told Canada not to take any
further action against Spanish vessels in international waters. But as
the statement was being issued a Spanish fishing boat was operating
within the area where Canada had earlier moved against two Spanish
vessels.
Canada called the presence of the boat ''provocative''. Observers
believed the Spanish might be using the vessel to encourage Canadian
action and escalate the dispute if Spain were seen to be losing the
diplomatic war.
The Commission warned in a letter to the Canadian Foreign Ministry:
''Any repetition of unilateral action by Canada would be bound to have
consequences for the relations between the EU and Canada likely to
extend beyond fisheries.''
EU ambassadors asked the Commission to send the letter despite
objections from Britain, which wants both sides to do nothing while
talks continue. But the act of putting sanctions on hold was seen as a
diplomatic victory for the UK as it sought to put Commonwealth before
Europe.
Although other states remained reticent on the issue it is known that
several of them supported the British approach in the belief that a fish
war involving violence and even naval engagements would solve nothing.
The Commission emphasised the need for a negotiated solution endorsed
by the North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation. It also protested that the
cutting of the nets of the Spanish vessel Pescamar Uno was illegal,
unacceptable, and endangered the lives of the crew.
The Commission rejected Canadian allegations of illegal fishing by
another Spanish vessel, Estai, which was seized on March 9 and released
only after the captain had been charged and her owners had paid a bond.

A YOUNG woman dismissed by Sky TV for alleged theft is taking the
company to court with the backing of her local MP.
Miss Sharon McGregor, 22, of Redding, Falkirk, was dismissed for her
#8200 a year job in January, for alleged involvement in the
disappearance of a registered letter containing money from Sky's
Livingston mailroom.
The only evidence the company used to link Miss McGregor with the
missing letter was that her handwriting appeared on a log sheet for
registered mail that day.
Sky gave Miss McGregor a permanent contract in October last year after
she impressed the firm with her performance as a temporary worker over
the previous five years. One month before the incident a company
assessment reported that her work and character were ''excellent''.
Then on January 25 she was sacked for ''an irretrievable breakdown of
trust''.
''I just couldn't believe it,'' she said yesterday. ''Not only did I
not steal the money, I had no reason or need to steal it.
''There were about 16 people working in the mail room. The money used
to be left around for hours after letters were opened and anyone could
walk in and out of the room.
''I feel really hurt, because I have been branded a thief on no
evidence whatsoever, and as Sky is the only company I have worked for. I
cannot even expect a reference.''
Miss McGregor appealed against her dismissal. Following her sacking
she was placed on tranquillisers by her GP and was unable to attend an
appeal hearing.
As she had been employed in a permanent capacity for only four months
she was not entitled to sue for unfair dismissal through an industrial
tribunal.
Now Miss McGregor and Falkirk East MP Michael Connarty, a Justice of
the Peace, are preparing to take Sky TV to court to claim damages.
''It has come to this because nothing was getting done and my name has
not been cleared,'' Miss McGregor said.
Mr Connarty has also written to Mr David Wheeler, the general manager
of Sky TV asking for immediate reversal of the sacking decision and
calling on the company to investigate a male employee who he alleges had
a greater motive to remove the envelope.
''I believe Sharon McGregor has been truthful in her statements and is
not a thief,'' he said.
''I would hope Sky would not be willing to make such a vicious attack
on a young innocent person on such contradictory evidence.''
A spokesman for Sky said any dealings were confidential between the
company and its former employee and it would make no comment on the
case.

SCOTTISH Homes has been accused of double-dealing over its treament of
tenants in Ayrshire.
The accusation was levelled by Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley
Labour MP George Foulkes who said the housing agency had raised rents by
more than 4% but cut local maintenance budgets by more than 34%. He also
attacked the cancellation of an improvement plan for 102 houses in
Patna.
He said: ''Coming on top of Scottish Homes' arrogance over the
disposal of its housing stock, where tenants are given no real choice on
who their new landlord should be, I find this latest double-dealing
equally shocking.''
After meeting Scottish Homes chairman, Sir James Mellon, in Edinburgh
yesterday, Mr Foulkes said he had learned the Patna improvements had
been postponed at least until the autumn.
A spokesman for Scottish Homes said: ''We valued the opportunity to
meet Mr Foulkes and to explain our spending programme in detail. We have
sought to reassure him that we will look at every possible opportunity
to reinstate the Patna programme as soon as possible.''
He said the agency's reactive maintenance scheme for the Central and
South West housing division was up by 4.3%.

THE Automobile Association last night expressed its concern about
safety on roads after an announcement by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang
that he intended to deregulate tourist signposting.
Mr Lang said the move would involve substantial measures to aid the
country's tourist industry, including a significant increase in the
number of tourist-related enterprises qualifying for full ''tourist
attraction'' signing.
He added: ''They will lead to better information and guidance for
visitors, without undue detriment to the visual environment and without
adversely affecting road safety.''
However, Neil Greig, roads and environment officer for the AA in
Scotland, perceived a threat to road safety from what he described as
''information overload'' on traffic signs facing motorists.
The AA made submissions to the Scottish Office about the planned
deregulation, along with traffic and planning authorities, area tourist
boards, local enterprise companies, and the Scottish Tourist Board.
Mr Greig said: ''We are in favour of making things easier on the
roads, but we are concerned that there will be a proliferation of signs
and that such an overload will have a road safety impact.
''Obviously there will be a list of symbols and types, but we fear
there will still be conflict at certain junctions.''
Overload could occur where all the various people who wanted to put
their particular piece of information on to a sign got their way.
''Deregulation of signposts must involve the strictest of controls,''
Mr Greig said.
The Scottish Office said that consultation on the need for revised
tourist traffic signs was announced last December and more than 100
responses had been taken into account before yesterday's announcement
was made.
The deregulation follows advice by a working group set up by the
Scottish Tourist Board, as one of the tasks identified by the National
Strategic Plan on the tourist industry up to the year 2000.

THE former England spin bowler, Tony Lock, has lost his long battle
against lung cancer, Surrey County Cricket Club announced yesterday.
Lock died at his home in Perth, Western Australia, aged 65.
In the glory years of Surrey cricket, when the county won the
championship in seven successive years from 1952 to 1958, Lock and Jim
Laker were the ''spin twins'' who wove their magic for Surrey and
England. Laker died in 1986.
The end of Lock's life was marred by child sex allegations. Last month
he was cleared of the charges by an Australian court.

THE BBC was at the centre of a furious political row yesterday as it
emerged the Prime Minister would appear on three of its programmes in
the run-up to next week's Scottish local elections.
The corporation was accused by Opposition parties of caving in to
pressure from the Government over alleged partiality, and attacked by
the SNP, which threatened legal action to block Mr Major's Panorama
interview being shown in Scotland.
The SNP claimed it was the unwitting victim of a plot by the BBC to
deflect flak from the decision to give the Prime Minister such a high
profile interview at this time. He is also due to be interviewed on the
BBC TV programme Good Morning with Anne and Nick today, and take part in
a radio phone-in on BBC Radio WM.
Labour criticism comes only days after Chief Secretary to the Treasury
Jonathan Aitken branded it the ''Blair Broadcasting Corporation'' and a
series of Cabinet Ministers echoed his attacks questioning its
impartiality -- supported by Mr Major.
Last night BBC Scotland moved to counter criticisms by announcing that
all four Scottish party leaders would be invited to a Scottish Local
Election Special programme in advance of next Thursday.
However, BBC Scotland said the question of the disputed Panorama
programme on Monday night was one for London, which was refusing to
budge last night in spite of the criticism.
The row has been further fuelled by the leak of an internal memo
revealing that the BBC knew it would face criticism over the planned
Panorama interview and had discussed a publicity strategy to defend its
failure to provide other party leaders with equivalent coverage.
BBC director-general John Birt was in Glasgow yesterday on a scheduled
meeting with Scottish controller John McCormick. In Scotland, and in
London, the row was in danger of spiralling out of control:
* THE SNP claimed it was approached earlier this week with offers for
leader Alex Salmond to appear for five minutes on Breakfast With Frost
on Sunday and on Newsnight on Monday night.
Only after yesterday's storm broke, they say, did they realise they
were being used to offset criticism about the Panorama programme. They
are taking legal advice with a view to having transmission halted north
of the Border.
* LABOUR in London demanded that the Panorama format be changed to
involve all party leaders, rather than just the Prime Minister, and
there was also a protest to the BBC from the party in Scotland insisting
that Labour's access to the airwaves in advance of next Thursday must
match that of the Conservatives and SNP.
* LIBERAL DEMOCRATS demanded an urgent meeting with BBC chairman
Marmaduke Hussey and an independent inquiry into BBC election coverage.
They also want the Panorama programme dropped in its present form and
were taking legal advice on the subject.
A letter from Labour's Scottish general secretary Jack McConnell to Mr
McCormick on the broadcasts featuring Mr Major and Mr Salmond stated:
''Unless all four main political parties in Scotland are given similar
opportunities, the potential advantage offered to the Conservatives and
the SNP is a matter of serious concern to us in Scotland and in Britain
and I am therefore writing to formally request your urgent consideration
for equivalent air time for an interview with the Labour Party between
now and next Thursday.''
SNP chief executive Michael Russell said the party had no idea when
the approaches were made offering brief appearances on the Frost
programme and Newsnight to Mr Salmond that it would become part of the
row. He stressed that such brief appearances did not balance a major
interview such as Panorama.
Shadow National Heritage Secretary Chris Smith wrote to Mr Tony Hall,
managing director of news and current affairs at the BBC, expressing
fears over the ''40-minute platform'' being given to Mr Major on
Panorama.
Mr Smith told Mr Hall that it was ''obvious to me that balance is
being eroded''.
The leaked internal BBC memorandum by Panorama deputy editor Nick
Robinson, a former chairman of the Young Conservatives, showed how BBC
executives proposed to defend the screening of the Panorama interview so
close to Thursday's poll.
The BBC confirmed the memorandum was genuine, but insisted it was
drawn up last Friday, before the current Government onslaught on the
Corporation.
It stated: ''In particular, we need an explanation for why we do not
intend to interview Blair, Ashdown or Salmond in a position of equal
prominence given that we are just three days before the Scottish local
elections and only just before the run-up to the English and Welsh local
elections.''
It added that Mr Hall would discuss the interview with Mr Major's
press secretary Christopher Meyer.
Labour sources expressed concern that commitments may have been given
to Downing Street about the contents of the Panorama interview.
A spokesman at No 10 said Mr Meyer had not yet spoken to the BBC about
the programme, which is due to be filmed on Sunday before Mr Major flies
to the US to meet President Bill Clinton.
Meanwhile, the BBC issued a further statement defending its decision
to go ahead with the Panorama interview. ''The interview with the Prime
Minister is a major news story at a critical time,'' it said. ''The memo
was written after we had considered how to ensure that the BBC is fair,
and is seen to be fair, across the whole range of our coverage.
''As always, we will ensure that all parties are fairly represented in
the course of the election campaign.''
