THE Loch Garten osprey nesting site in Strathspey is having its most
successful hatching season for seven years.
Staff at the centre yesterday confirmed that all three eggs in the
nest have now hatched -- the first time since 1988 all eggs laid in the
nest have produced chicks.
The first egg hatched last week and staff had an anxious wait to see
if the remaining pair would also give successful results.
The chicks are now being looked after by the female bird, which has
nested at Loch Garten for the past two years, and the male bird, now in
its sixth year at Strathspey.
The new arrivals are expected to draw further crowds to the Loch
Garten viewing area. Cameras are trained on the nest, situated about 150
yards from the visitor area, which allows video footage to be
transmitted to the visitor centre.
The hatching follows robberies at six osprey nests in Scotland in
recent weeks, when about 18 eggs have been stolen. The robberies have
set back the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds' programme to
re-colonise the osprey, which was extinct in Scotland until the 1950s.
Loch Garten warden Richard Thaxton said: ''The chicks are perfectly
healthy and getting enough food. This is great news.''

THE deputy chief executive of Aberdeen district counil, Mrs Anne
Hughes, and a staff colleague were last night feared drowned during a
trip to the former Soviet state of Belarus.
They had been part of a 41-strong council party visiting Gomel, one of
the worst areas affected by the Chernobyl disaster, which is one of
Aberdeen's twin cities.
A Foreign Office spokesman said that they had failed to return after
going swimming in Lake Gomel, near the Ukraine border, earlier
yesterday.
Later, two bodies were recovered from the lake, the spokesman added.
The first details of the tragedy reached Aberdeen late yesterday and
early today a council spokesman said: ''We are very shocked and
anxiously awaiting more information.''
Mrs Hughes, a qualified solicitor, took temporary charge of the
district council early in 1994 following the controversial early
retirement of former chief Donald MacDonald, who quit amid allegations
that he used false qualifications on council notepaper.
She spent six months in charge before a successor, Anne Mearns, was
appointed and she returned to her role as deputy chief executive.
The party left Aberdeen, twinned with Gomel in 1990, on Thursday to
spend three weeks studying life in the former Soviet city.
The group included senior council figures, including Councillors Alan
Donnelly and Rita Buchan, environmental health officials and
representatives from local recreation and development groups. The party
has been staying in the homes of local people.
Mrs Hughes, who has a grown-up child, joined Aberdeen district council
about three years ago.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: ''Officials from the British embassy
have been getting information from the members of the party and formal
identification of the two bodies is expected to take place today.
''We also have people travelling to Gomel to establish exactly what
happened,'' he added.

In Pretoria
THE Scottish domestic rugby next season is to be sponsored by Tennent
Caledonian Brewers. Details of the package, which entails a
''seven-figure sum'' over a three-year period, were announced yesterday
at a news conference in South Africa.
The deal represents a breakthrough into big-time rugby by the company
and coincides with a radical new look for the game in Scotland next
season with an innovative knock-out cup competition and a revamped
league structure.
The league system will be known as the SRU Tennents Championship and
the cup tournament will be named the SRU Tennents 1556 Cup in
recognition of the year in which brewing began at the company's Wellpark
site in Glasgow.
Under the SRU's former deal with Scottish Brewers each club in the
country received the same amount as part of the sponsorship package.
Details of the cash allocation to clubs under the new arrangement will
be announced at the SRU agm later this month, although chief executive
Bill Hogg said a two-tier system of payment was a possibility.
SRU president Ken Smith said: ''The increased level of investment in
the game reflects the growing attention being paid to rugby and to the
initiatives being developed by the union to make the sport more
attractive to a wider audience.''
The deal with Tennents is worth considerably more to the SRU than its
predecessor with Scottish Brewers. A three-fold increase is being talked
about.
Meanwhile, Scotland manager Duncan Paterson has accused the Rugby
World Cup authorities of treating the players like second class citizens
in the latest round of the hotel eviction row.
Paterson invoked the official disputes procedure at the weekend when
he was told that Scotland would have to move from their base in Pretoria
to a much less well appointed hotel just six blocks away.
The SRU have been protesting about the change, which was part of the
RWC pre-tournament accommodation schedule, since last September. The
decision to force Scotland to move was taken after a disputes' committee
meeting on Sunday, but only announced yesterday.
''We have nothing against the other hotel as such, but it is obvious
to everybody that it is, in essence, a business hotel and does not have
the facilities to cope with an international touring team,'' said
Paterson.
Scotland will share the new facilities with France who, according to
manager Guy Laporte, are moving under protest.
All eight quarter-finalists are being forced to move to new hotels.
The Southern Sun hotel chain is the accredited hotelier for the
tournament. The RWC authorities, said Paterson, had declared that there
had to be an ''equal level of inconvenience for all.''
He said that the alternative hotel, which he stayed in during a
managers' meeting last year, had no separate restaurant and only one
large room suitable for use as a squad room, which has been allocated to
France on the basis that they were the pool winners. Another totally
inadequate room was being provided for Scotland.
New Zealand and Ireland are scheduled to move into the Scotland hotel
today but, in any case, the Scottish squad is out of town on a two-day
trip to the Mala-Mala game reserve on the Mozambique border. They will
move into the new hotel on their return.
''My reading of the situation is that we are being forced to move just
for the sake of it and because everybody else is having to do
likewise,'' said Paterson.
The other four hotels being utilised for quarter-finalists are of
4-star standard, only Scotland and France are having to make do with a
3-star. The SRU have identified three other hotels that they would be
prepared to move into and have indicated that they would be willing to
meet the costs themselves.
The committee which turned down the Scottish appeal comprised Vernon
Pugh of Wales, Syd Millar of Ireland, and Hene Serfontein, the
son-in-law of SARFU chairman Louis Luyt.Paterson said that Serfontein
had told him that he would not allow the Northern Transvaal provincial
side to stay in the designated hotel, let alone an international touring
side.
''We have taken this as far as we can. We're not happy, but we'll move
to the new hotel and see how we get on.
''This new hotel, compared to the accommodation that the
administrators are staying in, is like night and day. This is the fifth
or sixth issue that we have raised with RWC since arriving here.
''Especially in South Africa we keep on hearing about players'
interests and I'm all for it. The players must come first but, compared
to the administrators, the players are being treated like second class
citizens.''
Last night the tournament organisers issued a statement declaring that
the appeal had been rejected after the disputes' committee had visited
the hotel and considered the accommodation appropriate to cater for the
needs of a national touring side.
Last week the SRU were involved in a dispute with the South African
Rugby Football Union over late payment of players' daily allowances.
* THE Rugby World Cup is proving a hit among armchair viewers with
almost 10m tuning in to watch England's final group game against Western
Samoa. The figure comfortably beat the audience for England's Grand Slam
decider with Scotland earlier this year.
Scotland's battle with the French on Saturday was another big draw
with 7.2m tuning in, while 6.2m watched Sunday's match between Ireland
and Wales.

RUGBY is going mad. For instance, I went to say goodbye to the
Romanians as they left their hotel at the foot of the spectacular Table
Mountain in Cape Town and met up with their personable and capable
captain, Tiberiu Brinza.
I said that they had been unlucky to play against such countries as
Canada and South Africa, and he agreed. ''What do you work at?'' I then
asked, by way of small talk. ''I used to be an electrician,'' he said,
''but now I am a student at the Faculty for Physical Training.''
''What does that mean?'' I asked. He thought for a moment. ''That
means,'' he said, ''that I am a rugby player.''
He looked crestfallen that his team was leaving South Africa. Mind
you, they say that the Romanian Ministry of Home Affairs still gives the
team manager the odd phone call when his boys lose.
Holy smoke. Here we have the Romanians full-time. Where will it all
end? It's becoming a rather sad chapter that we are ending up with rugby
populated by the sort of zombies that would usually play football now
turning full-time to serve us with a form of action that has turned a
contact sport into a collision-filled substitute for war. It ain't safe
out there any more, and it's going to get worse.
Rugby is a game of beauty, a game that has sights that no other match
can rival. Locks soaring for the ball in the lineout helped by
team-mates, individuals who can think and swerve, pass and tackle. The
limits of physical contact are defined by what the human body can take.
Rugby is a gorgeous game, and the only one in the world where the
object is to go forward by passing the ball backwards. It is one of the
few games in the world that can have beauty, and yet I cannot help
thinking, as many out here are, that what we are seeing at times is a
highly dangerous form of rugby, played by full-time sportsmen wearing
shoulder pads, some of which is not played in the kind of spirit that
rugby has, and few other sports rival. I suspect, too, that some of the
players are not enjoying it.
Rugby is a team game with protection as its key. As that lock soars
for the ball, his pack protect him. A player times a pass to release
another, not for his benefit, but for the team's.
But protection of individuals is becoming impossible in a sport whose
laws now suit the most powerful sides. And to get as powerful as they
can, and I cite as my defence the Aussie, French, New Zealand, and South
African teams, the players have to become full-time. Aussie coach Bob
Dwyer has said several times he now expects his players to earn a good
living from the game.
Sadly, countries that cannot produce beasts who can tackle like
Sherman tanks just will not be able to compete, and Japan have proven to
be just that nation. Western Samoa are perhaps an exception.
And this World Cup has advanced that rapid path to professionalism,
perhaps as the only way of protecting rugby union as a game.
I can give you a great argument that says that if rugby union stays
amateur, then it dies at the highest level, because some players, like
Jason Little, the Australian centre for instance, are staying in union
rugby only because one day it will be professional. Little has been
offered millions by Aussie rugby league and is, as they say in
Australia, ''four years through a three-year university course . . . and
two years left to do.''
Look at the Welsh. Johnathan Davies, Paul Moriarty, Paul Young, John
Devereux, Stuart Evans, Scott Quinnell, Scott Gibbs, and Mark Jones are
all playing rugby league. Unless union goes professional then the Welsh
will be raped further by the money men.
Do the players not understand that if they become professional then
they are at the beck and call of the sponsors all the time?
Don't they understand that if they become pros then they start having
to win rather than wanting to win? That the game will become more
dangerous? That they will become more shallow individuals? That they
will enjoy it less? That it will be ''one game at a time'' and ''two
more points and we're in Europe'' all the time?
Union is being rushed headlong into professionalism in an act of
self-preservation. The world spectacle will be wonderful. The human cost
could be incalculable.

WHILE the Edinburgh grapevine appears to become more convinced that
retired property developer Jim Glass is on course to take charge of
Hearts, the current club chairman, Chris Robinson, insists that there
has not been a genuine bid from Glass or anyone else.
The fact that Glass has stated he will invest #2m in the first
instance, all of which would go to buying players, and that he met
Robinson for an hour last Thursday, would suggest that there is
something serious going on. However, Robinson remains sceptical.
''When we met, it became clear that Mr Glass had not formulated his
plans in any real shape or form. There were no advisers, no lawyers, and
he did not seem keen to go that length. Nothing he said was of any real
substance. It is also the case that the money that would be invested
would come from three or four others, not from Glass himself.''
Robinson, who, with lawyer Leslie Deans, bought control of the club
from Wallace Mercer a year ago, also refuses to accept consistent public
assurances from Glass and Mercer himself that the former chairman will
not seek a way back to a prominent position at Tynecastle.
Even Mercer's plea at the weekend for the people concerned to remove
personalities from the discussions is not treated with any enthusiasm by
the current chairman. ''Personalities are what football life is about,''
he said, ''and to remove them would be like talking about the Tory Party
without mentioning John Major.''
While he does not necessarily believe that Mercer will emerge as a
force again if Glass succeeds in his bid, Robinson said: ''It would take
an awful lot to convince me and many people associated with Hearts --
fans, shareholders, etc -- that Wallace Mercer would not attempt to come
back to this club in a major capacity. I think we have learned over the
years that what Wallace says and what he does are not always the same.
''I have to say as well that there are many people in Edinburgh who
are not sure of Jim Glass, and wonder about his motives for wanting to
become involved with the club.''
Perhaps the fact that Mercer, who still owns almost a quarter of the
club and has a #1m guarantee still in place at the bank on Hearts'
behalf, had at one time hired Glass to join him in the Hearts Property
Development Company, formed with the idea of building a new stadium at
Millershall, has convinced the incumbents that conspiracy is afoot, but
Robinson also declares that Glass and Mercer met to discuss the new
proposal some time ago.
''What you have to accept is that the methodology of the proposals of
Jim Glass is the only one which would allow Wallace Mercer a way back.
Normally, a takeover bid would buy the majority shareholdings, but this
one proposes a new set of shares.''
Despite all of this, Robinson refuses to say that he and Deans would
turn down the Glass deal if it is put in writing. He went on to say that
what he has read of the Glass proposals in the press suggests they are
not so different from his own thoughts on the club's future.
However, he added: ''Jim Glass is not the only one interested in
investing in the club.'' Pressed on that subject, he refused to name
names and added only that the people concerned would be sure to stay
quiet while the current debate goes ahead.

WALES' management team of Alex Evans and Geoff Evans blamed poor club
coaching, poor preparation and a lack of structure in the domestic game
following their 24-23 defeat by Ireland and early exit from the World
Cup.
As the inquest began, coach Alex Evans slammed his squad's lack of
preparation. ''Countries like New Zealand, Australia, England and South
Africa have been working towards this tournament for the last four
years,'' he said. ''The Wales players had just three weeks together at
the end of the season.
''Even countries like Argentina and Canada have steadily built up for
this event by having good tours during the past 12 months. Wales, by
contrast, have had Mickey Mouse tours to Zimbabwe and Namibia.
''But we need to put the structure in place from under-18 through
under-21 and emerging team level, so that young players come through
developing a pattern of play that is the best one for Wales to be
successful.''

CELTIC Swing could still run in Saturday's Vodaphone Derby, it was
confirmed yesterday by his jockey, Kevin Darley.
Darley was speaking at Hamilton Park less than 24 hours after his
triumphant success on Celtic Swing in the French Derby.
He revealed that owner Peter Savill had flown back to England
immediately after the race to walk the course at Epsom.
''He phoned me this morning to say he was leaving Celtic Swing in the
race as a precaution.''
Darley, who was presented with a magnum of champagne to mark his
achievement in the Chantilly Classic, thinks it is extremely unlikely
that Celtic Swing will run at Epsom.
But it was business as usual for Darley yesterday. After having
finished second on Essayeffsee in the opener, he rode Satellite Star to
victory in a close finish in the Rapid Raceline Conditions Stakes.
Suedoro gave Lesmahagow trainer Robert McKellar his first winner when
the five-year-old mare dead-heated with Birchwood Son in the Headlam
Flooring Handicap Stakes.
In a blanket finish, less than two lengths separated the first four
horses.
McKellar, who took out a licence in August last year had to wait 20
nail-biting minutes for the judges' verdict.
They studied two prints of the photograph but were unable to separate
the first two horses.
''I am absolutely thrilled to have my first winner and don't mind at
all that it was a dead heat,'' said McKellar.
Apprentice jockey Paul Fessey, who rode Suedoro, received a one-day
ban from the stewards for misuse of the whip and Nick Connorton, jockey
of Diet, was banned for three days for a whip offence.
Jason Weaver, who partnered Birchwood Son in the dead heat, had
earlier been successful on Talented Ting and completed a short-price
treble on Silverdale Knight.
Lord Advocate (7-4 favourite) was the second Scottish winner of the
meeting when the Wishaw-trained gelding made all under jockey Neil
Varley to win the Blenheim Handicap Stakes, a repeat performance of his
success at the Lanarkshire track 16 days ago.

CONFRONTER can land his own personal ''Derby'' today in the Brighton
Mile Challenge Trophy.
Brighton's switchback course is the nearest equivalent to the Epsom
track which stages Britain's premier Classic on Saturday.
The sharp bends and steep gradients seem tailor-made for Confronter
who encounters similar terrain every day at his trainer Simon Dow's
Epsom base.
He gained a most authoritative success over today's distance in April
and would almost certainly have followed up three weeks later but for
meeting trouble in running.
The six-year-old has been given plenty of time to recover after
cutting little ice when stepped up in class at Ascot subsequently and
generally runs well fresh -- he landed a #6500 race at Cagnes-Sur-Mer on
his reappearance in January.
Confronter remains well-treated at the weights and can make a winning
return to his second home.
Henry Cecil is adept at plundering conditions races at Pontefract and
he looks to have found an ideal oportunity for Syrian Queen in the
Ropergate Maiden Stakes for three-year-olds.
The filly failed to make the course as a juvenile and looked very much
in need of the experience on her debut at Newbury last month.
All of which makes her short-head second to Mountains of Mist a
particularly encouraging performance.
She had looked set for a winning debut when moving smoothly into the
lead three furlongs out and rallied well once headed at the distance.
The benefit of that experience will make her very hard to beat this
time.
Lynda Ramsden's Shinerolla has improved dramatically this year and has
probably not stopped progressing yet.
He routed 19 rivals in a limited stakes race on this course early in
May. And his one-length win in a handicap on the track three weeks later
would have been much more decisively achieved but for Kieran Fallon
easing him considerably in the final furlong.
A 5lb rise in the weights is unlikely to prevent his gaining a third
course victory in the Kalamazoo GMS Security Ticket Handicap.

over, but his quest for a third straight title still is very much alive.
He earned a hard-fought, fourth-round victory over Magnus Larsson as
well as the boos of the crowd after having halted play for some five
minutes in the final tie-breaker over a disputed line call.
''I was surprised and sad that suddenly, all the people were against
me,'' Bruguera said after the 6-1, 2-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-4) victory. ''I
think it's not that bad to fight for your rights.''
The Spaniard has landed the French title two years in succession and
became a hero with the crowd for his tenacious, never-give-up style. But
yesterday's capricious display soured that relationship.
''It affected me because I was very surprised at this reaction,''
Bruguera said. ''I like this crowd and I don't think I did anything
wrong.''
Although the spectators then got behind Larsson, he let the match slip
away with three unforced errors in the last four points.
But the fans at Court A found a new hero in the next match when
Romanian Adrian Voinea, ranked No.128, became only the second qualifier
to reach the quarter-finals in this event. Thierry Champion did it in
1990.
Voinea, who defeated No.3 seed Boris Becker in the third round, moved
into the last eight with 7-6 (7-3), 6-3, 6-4 victory over Andrei
Chesnokov.
The Romanian now meets Michael Chang, seeded No.6 seed, who came back
after having lost the opening set against Michael Stich to beat the
German 1-6, 6-0, 6-2, 6-3.
Chang won 10 games in a row after having dropped the first set, and
was helped by Stich's 60 unforced errors. ''He was not missing anything,
I could not find a shot to hurt him,'' Stich said.
Chang was 17 years and three months when he made history at Roland
Garros in 1989 by becoming the youngest Grand Slam champion in history.
''The last few years I've been struggling here at the French,'' Chang
said. ''I've learned a lot. I've learned a lot from playing here in
Paris and I've learned from the previous years in many ways. I think
that the game has changed in certain ways and I have to make certain
adjustments to play on clay.''
Bruguera's next opponent will be Renzo Furlan, who ended the run of
upset victories by Australian qualifier Scott Draper, winning 7-5, 6-1,
7-6 (8-6).
Furlan, ranked No.61, moved into his first Grand Slam quarter-final
without having to play a seeded player.

KILMARNOCK defender Neil Whitworth managed to play for only two
minutes in the club's summmer trip to Korea, and may need an operation
when he comes home.
Whitworth suffered a bad cut from an elbow in his face, according to
manager Alex Totten, early in the game against a Rio selection in the
Korea Cup tournament yesterday in Suwon, south of Seoul. The cut needed
five stitches to his nose, but the manager reckons he may need surgery
when he returns.
Killie lost 2-1 after having gone ahead through Robert Connor. The
Brazilians scored twice in the last 14 minutes, and it is unlikely that
the Scots will qualify for the semi-finals.
Kilmarnock had drawn 2-2 with Costa Rica at the weekend, when Steve
Maskrey and Paul Wright scored their goals, and now have to hope that
they beat South Korea on Wednesday, while Costa Rica and Rio draw.

SCOTLAND manager Craig Brown offered up an Identikit picture of the
type of player he will rely on this week as the squad landed on the tiny
Faroe Islands for the last away game in the current European
Championship campaign.
Brown knows that only a single-minded professional is needed to give
his team the required.
And, while waiting for the ferry to take the team from one island to
another, he emphasised the qualities needed.
''I don't want the players to put on the war paint and shout and bawl
about what they are going to do,'' he said.
''Quite often, these are the players who go out on the park and are
then meek and mild.
''It's often the quieter ones, those who get tuned in to what is
needed and sit in a corner and concentrate, who are the ones who are
most effective. These are the men we need here, good professionals who
know what is required, who will go out and do the job.''
Brown is buoyant, optimistic even, and refusing to contemplate failure
against the part-time opposition.
The history of the national team is littered with bad memories and
embarrassed retreats from foreign parts.
''I just won't think about losing,'' he said. ''I'm not into these
self-fulfilling prophesies. You know the kind of thing I mean, when you
forecast trouble for yourself and then trouble suddenly arrives. I don't
want to know about that.
''We are here to win the game and the players and myself believe we
can do it.''
The major problem for Brown is how to keep an edge on his players for
a game which is so vital to them but which seems to mean so little to
everyone in the Faroes.
At stake for the Scots is a place in the European finals in England.
For the Faroes it is a day out, a chance to test themselves against
stronger opposition.
Brown recognises that there is little to excite his players and, yet,
he knows that there must be a sense of tension.
He said: ''Our job is to have the players peak for the game. It is so
very different from the normal European Championship match. Usually,
when you arrive in a city there is some atmosphere, there are crowds,
they are people talking about the game, there is a police escort from
the airport, but here there is nothing.
''But we know that the result is vital so we have to make sure that we
can lift the players.
''There are three points at stake, and after this match, we finish
with three home games. Anyone can see how important getting a result
here will be.
''What we want from the players is the same approach as we had in
Moscow. We were positive there and we want to be positive here.
''I know we were criticised in San Marino and this time I want the
players to keep the pressure on the opposition.
''I think that the longer the game goes, if we can keep the pace up,
then our fitness will tell.
''But we know we cannot take chances. These players are improving and
there have been enough warnings to let us know that we cannot be
complacent.''
Clearly, Brown was referring to the rash of surprise results across
Europe -- Lichtenstein drawing with the Republic of Ireland, Iceland
doing the same with Sweden, and Portugal only winning 3-2 against
Latvia.
''We have asked the players to peak several times this season
already,'' said Brown, ''but this is the last time we will look for them
to do it.
''But if they do what we want then they can go off on holiday with the
thought of England and the finals next summer.

BRIAN Lara made another flying visit yesterday -- bagging a
second-ball duck against Northamptonshire.
The West Indian world record-breaker jetted home to Trinidad last week
to sort out some ''urgent personal business.''
And it looked as though his head was still in the clouds at the County
Ground when he wasted a golden opportunity for batting practice before
Thursday's opening Test against England at Headingley.
Lara pushed back the first ball from former England seamer Paul Taylor
-- then launched into an intended cover drive second delivery and was
bowled off an inside edge.
The man who scored 375 against England 14 months ago and 501 for
Warwickshire against Durham last summer is finding life a little more
difficult these days.
Despite heading the averages during West Indies' recent Test series
defeat by Australia, Lara failed to make a century. And his form so far
this tour has been less than sparkling, with a top score of 78 from six
innings.
While Lara failed, there was good news for the tourists with both
Jimmy Adams and Keith Arthurton making the most of a final day which was
always destined to finish in a draw.
Adams, who looked badly out of touch during the Texaco Trophy series,
grafted his way to 93. He was upstaged, though, by Arthurton, who
followed 140 against Leicestershire last week with an unbeaten 121.
Meanwhile, Richard Illingworth yesterday celebrated his England Test
recall by helping Worcestershire to their first Britannic Assurance
Championship victory of the season against Surrey at New Road.
Illingworth claimed three for 23 from 16.1 overs as Surrey, chasing a
victory target of 287 in 74 overs, slumped to a 134-run defeat.
Illingworth claimed the scalps of Alec Stewart (50) and last man Joey
Benjamin while Stuart Lampitt also pitched in with three for 43 from 14
overs.
Another player inspired by his England call was Mark Ramprakash, who
hit 75 -- his highest score in four weeks -- in Middlesex's draw with
Derbyshire.

In Toulon, Scotland 1, Mexico 2
SCOTLAND under-21 team manager Tommy Craig was fiercely critical of
his side after their defeat at the hands of Mexico in the opening game
of the Toulon International Tournament.
Rarely did the Scots look capable of justifying their position as one
of the tournament favourites after a defeat which leaves them with an
uphill task to qualify from the two remaining games against France and
South Korea.
''I'm very disappointed, and so are the players. They know they let
themselves down,'' said Craig. ''They never functioned as a unit which
has been their strength in recent games. They have been able to go to
places and dictate games but never at any stage were they in control and
Mexico will feel that they did a good job.''
After Celtic winger Brian McLaughlin and Aberdeen midfield player had
missed two early chances, the signs became ominous for the Scots.
The Mexicans opened the scoring after 29 minutes when Garcia picked
out Luna with a superb cross-field pass. He rounded Duncan Jupp with
ease before beating keeper Derek Stillie.
The only time the Scots posed problems was when Doug Freedman was
brought into the play and the Barnet player breathed life into
Scotland's cause with an equaliser on the stroke of half-time.
David Hannah and Stephen Glass carved out an opening with neat
interplay and Freedman squeezed the ball in at the near post.
Freedman almost helped to put the Scots ahead soon after the restart
when he eased past his marker but Hannah's header from the cross went
over the bar.
Garcia hit a post as the Scots pressed forward and, after 76 minutes,
Luna struck again with a magnificent half volley which gave Stillie no
chance.
SCOTLAND -- Stillie (Aberdeen), Jupp (Fulham), Dailly (Dundee United),
Pressley (Coventry), Baker (St Mirren), Hannah (Dundee United),
Fullarton (St Mirren), Glass (Aberdeen), McLaughlin (Celtic), Freedman
(Barnet), Crawford (Raith Rovers).
MEXICO -- Rangel, Lopez, Martinez, Oteo, Carreton, Sancho, Carino,
Luna, Ortega, Nieto, Garcia.
Referee -- J Coroado (Portugal).

DEREK Forsyth, coach of McMahon Kelburne for the last five years,
yesterday received a fine send-off when the Paisley club won bronze
medals in the European club championship following their 3-0 defeat of
Grammarians of Gibraltar.
Kelburne were 2-0 up at half time with goals from David Magee and
Billy Anderson. After the break Grammarians abandoned their defensive
policy but the only highlight of the half came in the last minute, when
David McKay scored a third goal.
It was a rather subdued Forsyth who broke the news of his retirement
after the game, for he has helped Kelburne to become not just a strong
force in domestic hockey but also a side which has made an impact on the
European scene.
With a young family Forsyth feels hockey ''is taking up too much of my
time'' -- he also coaches Scotland's men's under-21 side.
The highlight of Forsyth's coaching career with Kelburne was the
winning of the national league title three years in a row from 1989.
Forsyth's players did not quite deliver the goods this time by
securing a place in the final. But they gave him the next best thing and
so he leaves the club in a strong position.
Racing Club of France, who denied them a place in the final, won the
gold medals, beating Minsk from Belarus 5-3.
Western Klick Photopoint in the A Division of the women's championship
at Utrecht, Holland, failed to make it a bronze double. They were beaten
1-0 by Siauliai, from Lithuania, in the play-off for third place.
Their final also went to penalties with Kampong, their hosts, winning
a penalty shootout 2-0 against Berlin. Results:
Men (places five to eight) -- Whitchurch 3, Wien Cobra 0; Hostivar 2,
Stockholm 2 (Hostivar won 4-3 on penalties). Third and fourth -- McMahon
Kelburne 3, Grammarians 0. Final -- Racing Club (France) 1, Minsk 1
(Racing Club won 5-3 on penalties).
Women (five to eight) -- Randalstown 4, Stade Francais 0; Leicester 2,
Swansea 2 (Leicester won 4-3 on penalties). Third and fourth -- Siauliai
1, Western Klick Photopoint 0. Final -- Kampong 1, Berlin 1 (Kampong won
2-0 on penalties).

GOLF: AMATEUR CHAMPIONSHIP
HAVING missed every cut so far this season David Downie sparked a
revival of fortunes in the opening round of the Amateur Championship at
Hoylake yesterday with an outrageous albatross aiding a record-equalling
round of 68 across the Wallasey qualifying course.
The 22-year-old from Ladybank holed a No.8-iron approach at the
487-yard fourteenth en route to his four-under-par total. It gives him a
one-stroke lead over fellow Scot Roger Beames, Richard Bland of
Bramshott Hill, David Howell of Broome Manor, and highly rated New
Zealander Marcus Wheelhouse.
Until Downie's remarkable round Bathgate's Stephen Gallacher led the
Scottish contingent, revelling in the calm conditions to grab four
birdies in a 71.He said: ''The wind was very strong yesterday, but
fortunately it was not affecting the ball today.''
The meticulously prepared European amateur champion realised on Sunday
night that he had left eight pairs of golf trousers hanging on his
bedroom door -- obviously anticpating a long week -- but he shrugged
aside the mishap.
Gallacher heads fellow Scotland cap Barclay Howard by a single stroke,
who was bogied the final three holes for a 72.
Former Scottish Boys' champion Alan Reid scrambled around the more
demanding Royal Liverpool course carding five bogies, a double bogey and
four birdies to spend the day as leading Scot alongside clubmate Gordon
Sherry and Glenbervie's James Clive. Scottish Amateur champion Hugh
McKibbin stole the honour of leading Scot late in the day with a
one-over-par 73.
Even in the benign conditions the international field of 288 still
struggled to break par across the former Open Championship venue.
Atherstone's Steve Webster was the first, rolling in a 10-foot birdie
putt on the 418-yard eighteenth for his 71 with Simon McCarthy of Royal
North Devon the second an hour later. Irish internationlist Gary Murphy
headed the field with a two-under-par 70 alongside countryman Graham
Spring of Tralee. Leading scores:
ROYAL LIVERPOOL
70 -- G Murphy (Kilkenny), G Spring (Tralee).
71 -- S Webster (Atherstone), S McCarthy (Royal North Devon).
72 -- B Toone (Ellesmere).
73 -- J Fanagan (Milltown), B Hafthorsson (Iceland).
74 -- P Scarlett (Blackwell), A Wall (Sunningdale), J Bragger (Lees
Hall), M Blackley (Hayling), P Murray (Tipperary), T Milford (The
Ridge).
Other Scottish scores included: 73 -- H McKibbin (Troon Welbeck). 75
-- J Clive (Glenbervie), A Reid (Kilmarnock Barassie), G Sherry
(Kilmarnock Barassie). 76 -- B Wann (Nairn). 77 -- S Young

ETHIOPIAN Haile Gebresilasie broke the world 10,000 metres record by
almost nine seconds in Hengelo, Holland, last night -- a year and a day
after having set a 5000m best on the same track.
Gebresilasie, the world 10,000m champion, clocked 26min.43.53sec
beating Kenyan William Segei's previous mark of 26-52.23 established in
Oslo in July last year.
The 22-year-old policeman had to do all the work himself after the
last pace-setter dropped out after 6000m. By that time he was 11 seconds
under world record pace.
With a 1000m remaining Gebreselasie was six seconds ahead of Sigei's
pace, but running smoothly and well within himself, he lived up to his
pre-race promise to take the record after a long solo sprint for the
finish.
It proved quite a meeting, with Merlene Ottey (Jamaica) taking the
100m in 11.00sec, German Astrid Kumbernuss throwing 20.48m in the shot,
and Britain's Paula Radcliffe producing one of the best runs of her
career to win the 5000m.
The 21-year-old clocked 15-02.87 to beat Ethiopia's Olympic 10,000m
champion Derarte Tulu.
0 But records were not confined to Holland yesterday with Russian Olga
Kuzenkova setting a world best in the women's hammer with a throw of
68.14m at an international competition in Moscow, beating the previous
record of Romania's Mihaela Melinte by more than a metre.
* INTENDING competitors in tomorrow's 10,000m road race, organised by
Ayr Seaforth AC, should note that the venue has been changed. The race
will start at 7.30pm from Ayr Rugby Club, Alloway, and not at Dam Park
stadium.

* This week's tip comes from GORDON LAW, the professional at Uphall
Golf Club, West Lothian.
HANDICAP players often find it difficult to achieve success with the
long irons. But with practice, and a few helpful tips, you should be
able to master the shot that can be a welcome part of your armoury when
you need to hit the ball low into the wind.
The most common fault is leaning forward with the weight on the toes.
This results in an over-steep swing -- the shoulders lift instead of
turn -- and, almost inevitably, a slice.
So, the first rule is to keep the weight on the heels. And, at
address, position the ball well forward in the stance (just inside the
left heel).
Because of the longer shafts, it is more difficult to control the
irons in the one to three range. Another tip, therefore, is to keep the
backswing relatively short.
Overswinging will often result in a topped shot, so keep to a
three-quarter backswing to ensure more control.
The final hint is stay loose, and don't try to hit the ball too hard.
Let the club do the work. This will be achieved through confidence -- so
get out on to the practice ground and you'll soon master these tricky
long irons.
* GORDON Law won the Wishaw Pro-am on Sunday with a six-under-par 63
which equalled the course record.

THE sponsor of a 36-hole club competition puts up the prize of a
television set which sells at #300.
Club officials tell him that while this is a generous gesture, it is
well in excess of the limit of a voucher or prize with a retail value of
#200 specified in Rule 1-4 of the Rules of Amateur Status.
The sponsor argues that, being in the business, the television set is
available to him at #200 or less.
That being the case, can the prize be offered without the winner being
liable to forfeit his amateur status?
NO. Decision 1-4/2 -- contained in Decisions on the Rules of Amateur
Status -- specifies that retail value is the normal recommended selling
price or offers available to the public but not short-term ones or those
restricted to certain customers.
However, if the competition had been held over 54 or 72 holes the
prize would be legitimate, as #300 is the limit for events of more than
two rounds.

THE Western Open, which was held at Cowal at the weekend as a 36-hole
pro-am, could become a 72-hole tournament and a Tartan Tour order of
merit counter next year.
Preliminary discussions towards that end have already taken place
between the Dunoon club and the Scottish Region of the PGA.
First, the club membership must agree to give up their course for the
duration, and should that be the case, efforts would be made to secure
sponsorship to enable the prize fund to be doubled to around #30,000.
The format would be similar to the Dunbar Classic, which fell by the
wayside four years ago.
A field of 132 professionals would play the first two rounds among
themselves with the top 40 and ties going forward to the final two
rounds, which would be played, as now, as a pro-am.
Allan Douglas, the tournament director, said: ''There is already a
Northern Open and this year a Southern Open, both played over 72 holes.
''The idea we are looking at is to have a Western Open of a similar
stature.''
The Cowal event began five years ago to mark the club's centenary.
It was conceived as an 18-hole pro-am, but the demand was more than
double what was anticipated and so the two-day event was born and has
been sustained since with the claim of being the biggest pro-am of its
kind in Europe.
Next year, moreover, the club also will have in place a new #600,000
clubhouse on which work has just begun beside the first tee on a higher
site than at present.
Neil Simpson, secretary of the Scottish PGA, said: ''The tournament
has established itself as such a good one that it would be nice to
enhance it even more.
''The players would welcome it as well because they love 72-holers.''
Currently, there are seven on the fixture list and this compares to 83
pro-ams, which account for more than #500,000 of the total Tartan Tour
prize fund of #750,000.
The pro-ams also raise more than #500,000 per year for charity.
* THE Scottish Golf Union committee looking into possible sites for
their proposed national golf centre are aiming to present two or three
solutions to their executive for a decision in September.
Ernest Barnard, senior vice-president of the SGU, said that currently
five or six venues were under examination and they range from greenfield
sites to facilities already in existence.
* THE Sam Torrance trophy, a family greensome competition run by
Clydesdale District Sports Council, is to be held at centenary club
Biggar on July 9, and Inverness is the venue on August 8 for the
Scottish Inter-District women's team tournament, the final one under the
current format with local government reorganisation coming into force
next April.
The latter event, of which Moray are holders, has a unique format with
four-women teams consisting of one each from silver, bronze, over 50,
and under-18 groups.

JUST a week after it had been noted that no woman had equalled any
standard scratch score after five weeks of Parbusters -- representing
more than 10,000 rounds of golf -- no fewer than four have done exactly
that in week six, writes Douglas Lowe.
At Prestwick St Cuthbert, former finalist Catherine Malcolm shot 71 in
a club open competition; at Ranfurly Castle, Lesley Robertson went round
in 73 in the Dorrie Hunter Trophy; at St Andrews, Joyce Flannagan carded
75 over the Jubilee Course in the St Rule club's May Medal; and at
Williamwood, Pamela Shaw tallied 70 in the captain's and vice-captain's
competition.
All convert to Parbusters scores of level, and the players take the
joint lead. Now, who is going to be first to post a minus score?
Elsewhere, scoring has been lower than usual with nine under the best
of the handicappers and no male better than minus eight or minus four in
scratch. Pretty ordinary stuff? We must be getting blaze. This week's

SCOTTISH Livestock Services -- a leading member of the Supersires
Group -- have taken delivery of a further six high potential young sires
for their 1995 progeny test programme. Managing director Jack Lawson
said:''It is essential that the UK dairy farmer takes progeny testing
more seriously if we are going to lessen our dependence on high-priced
imported semen. Although progress is being made, other countries in
Europe are still testing greater numbers proporionately.
''As far as quality is concered I doubt if any country in the world
offers young sires with greater production potential or higher pedigree
evaluations.''
The six bulls pictured at the Newlands Cattle Breeding Centre at Perth
are part of a total of at least 30 which will be tested this year by SLS
and the Supersires group.

ABERDEEN Angus producers, who have managed to win 15p a kilo premium
for their beef must be prepared to grasp the nettle of certification,
says Mr Jim Ironside, managing director of the producer group --
Aberdeen Angus Producers (Scotland).
Speaking at an Open Day at Mains of Coburty, Fraserburgh, he said ''We
must ensure that what is sold through our group can be certified as
genuine Aberdeen Angus.'' Their name was now recognised as a trademark,
so there was just one genuine article, he emphasised.
Mr Ironside said that the group was currently in discussion with four
of the six leading names in the supermarket sector. Their strength lay
to some extent in scarcity value. ''On every supermarket shelf you can
find Kellogs or Heinz -- but not Aberdeen Angus. We will never be in a
position to supply all the volume users.''
He reported, however, that more certified cattle were coming to the
market -- 10,000 by August of this year compared to 3500 last year. The
potential for next year was nearly 20,000. In order to increase
availability he estimated a further 200 bulls were required but he
chided some breeders for being unwilling to bear the costs involved.
''There are good bulls available and have been for some time'' he
said. ''The truth is that some folk want to buy a good bull at a poor
bull price.''
Veteran beef cattle feeder, Joe Mitchell, who hosted the open day said
that British supermarkets were coming to realise -- as their American
counterparts had done -- that they had to buy better beef. ''There is no
future in the business unless you produce good quality meat,'' he said.
''The consumer is going to lead the market to better quality beef.''
Performing the opening ceremony Mr Maitland Mackie, farmer and
chairman of Grampian Enterprise emphasised the importance of meeting the
demands of the market. The perception throughout the world was that
Aberdeen Angus was the pinnacle for taste and quality, he said and he
applauded the breed's efforts to tape into the quality market which was
undoubtedly there.
To gain command of the market producers would have to learn to operate
and to co-ordinate their efforts, he said. ''You have to grow the market
at the speed you can grow supply. I also believe you need to put in
place a high profile PR campaign. That is a collective investment, not a
cost.''
On the question of taste, tenderness and succulence he suggested that
ways had to be found of checking the finished product for these
qualities. ''Do you test for it and then breed for it? Or do you just
hope that it is there and it stays there?''
To gain the confidence of increasingly concerned consumers producers
would require to be seen to be forcing discipline and good farming
practice, he said. All members of the Aberdeen Angus Society should be
in farm assurance schemes as part of the written rules of the Society.

LEADING UK accountant and consultancy companies yesterday reported
differing levels of progress during the past 12 months to end March
against the background of the recovering economy.
Leading the field in terms of growth in UK fee income was Arthur
Andersen which has chalked up an advance of 9% to #539.5m. This reflects
growth in the firm's audit, business advisory and tax services, which
has offset the decline in receiverships as a result of improved economic
conditions.
Eric Hagman, managing partner of Arthur Anderson Scotland said that
''over the past year Arthur Andersen was appointed as accountants to the
enquiry being conducted by the Board of Banking Supervision of the Bank
of England into the collapse of Barings.
''Members of our Scottish Financial Markets team are heavily involved
in the enquiry. Andersen also assisted Swiss Banking Corporation in its
#860m bid for the investment banking operation of S G Warburg.''
Major new audit clients gained during the year included BBA, the large
automotive products and industrial group, and Fisons, the international
pharmaceutical business.
Mr Hagman added: ''In Scotland, the firm continues to act for some of
the country's best known businesses. We have an excellent group of
clients, many of whom are actively developing their business through
acquisition.
''In addition, our business consultancy practice is working with many
of Scotalnd's top companies on a variety of projects. We have also been
successful in selling contract audit services to major Scottish
organisations.
KPMG, which won some major new accounts during the year and registered
an advance of 6.2% from #497.6m to #528.4m in UK fee income, showed
strong growth in audit and accounting, up nearly 7%. Higher fees were
also recorded in management consulting, corporate finance, and taxation.
Senior partner Colin Sharman commented: ''Across the board, clients
are coming out of the recession and 20% growth in management consultancy
is an indication that healthy growth is returning for professional
firms.
''Despite the hugely competitive marketplace for audit and accounting
services, we have been able to grow this business by 6.6% and improve
our service quality.''
Important audit wins for KPMG during the period included the BBC, the
Bradford and Bingley Building Society, Booker, Allied Colloids,
Persimmon, North West Water Group, and the Woolwich Building Society.
Ernst &amp; Young lifted its UK fee income by 3.3% from #388.4m to
#401.2m. In addition, the firm achieved significant growth in the
evolving internal audit market including major assignments in the
financial services sector, as well as the DTI and the Research Councils.
On the insolvency and corporate side, the climax of the year for Ernst &amp;
Young was its appointment as administrators of Barings.
The company said: ''There has been intense competition across our
range of services and the lower levels of merger and acquisition
transactions have further emphasised the need for investment in new
services.
UK Fee income at Touche Ross saw UK fee income rise by 1.2% from
#332.9m to #336.8m over the period. Insolvency revenue fell 19% to
#31.9m and accounting &amp; auditing by 7.4% to #121.8m.
However, management consulting grew 23.5% from #69.5m to #85.8m.
For Price Waterhouse there was actually a small decline in fee income,
by just 0.4% to #383.2m. Its corporate recovery arm saw fee income fall
22.2% to #27.3m. Other operations posted slight increases with the
auditing business lifting income by 2.8% to #163.3m. The tax division's
fee income rose 0.9% and management consultancy 0.1%.

MEDIA group EMAP, whose interests include regional newspapers and
consumer magazines such as Elle, Practical Gardening, and Smash Hits,
reported a 40% increase in annual profits to #63.9m.
The company benefited from acquisitions which contributed #4.8m to
profits. Underlying profits grew by 22%. There is a final dividend of
7.25p making a total for the year of 9.75p, a rise of 14%.
In total, Emap made acquisitions worth #265m and is keen to
consolidate and get the best out of its new purchases. Its main
acquisitions, which include some French magazines, Trans World
Communications, and the business-to-business activities of Maclean
Hunter, are said to be performing ahead of expectations.
However, chief executive Robin Miller said the group would have to
look hard if any ''excellent'' magazine or radio acquisition
opportunities arose. While EMAP was not interested in getting into
mainstream television broadcasting, it sees potential in specialist
niche channels on cable or satellite related to its specialist
magazines. However, there are no deals on the cards at the present time.
During the year, advertising revenue grew by 12% with job advertising
particularly buoyant. Mr Miller said the company was unlikely to repeat
the 47% rise seen in its regional newspapers. Circulation revenue was 5%
better.
Profits from its newspapers and newspaper printing activities
increased by #1.2m to #9.3m after adjusting for expenditure of #2m on
printing site rationalisation taken in 1993/94. Advertising yields rose
7% over the year. Twenty-five of EMAP's 40 paid-for titles recorded
sales increases, but daily papers showed a slight decline.
EMAP foresees a slower rate of revenue growth because of lingering
economic uncertainty. In addition, further increases in the cost of
paper are expected throughout 1995. Paper is expected to make up 15% of
the group's total operating costs in 1995/96 compared to 12% last year.
However, the results were at the top end of City expectations and the
shares gained 3p to 460p.

<HEADLINE>Red tape blamed for collapse of #100m Norwegian contract. ScottishPower pulls out of gas deal</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>IAN MCCONNELL</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>27</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978026633</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT red-tape has scuppered ScottishPower's agreement to import
about #100m worth of Norwegian gas, which was to have been used in the
electricity company's fight against acid rain at its coal-fired
Longannet Power Station in Fife.
With the UK and Norwegian governments still trying to resolve their
differences over gas imports to Britain, ScottishPower appears to have
lost patience.
Last April, the Glasgow-based utility signed a contract to purchase
more than 60 billion cubic feet of gas from the new Froy field, in the
Norwegian sector of the North Sea, from state-owned Den norske stats
oljeselskap (Statoil) and Norsk Hydro Produksjon.
This was principally intended for ScottishPower's pioneering gas-burn
project at Longannet, aimed at reducing emissions of oxides of nitrogen
which contribute to acid rain and smog. The project will increase the
chances of coal remaining a major energy source in Scotland.
The Froy contract was conditional upon the companies receiving
satisfactory approvals from their respective governments.
However, a ScottishPower spokesman said yesterday: ''Despite
continuous strenuous efforts to make the necessary arrangement to allow
importation of gas to the UK, it has not been possible to do so and, as
a result, the contract will not proceed.''
Although the company declined to disclose its reasons, it may be that
ScottishPower considers the future commercial risk of the contract
unacceptable.
The UK Government appears unhappy with an existing treaty with Norway,
signed in 1976.
This covers the pipeline bringing gas ashore from the Frigg field,
which is adjacent to Froy, at the giant St Fergus Terminal on the
North-east coast.
A DTI spokesman said yesterday: ''We do believe that the treaty which
governs the use of the Frigg pipeline, which Froy uses to reach the UK,
will fall to be revised when production from the Frigg gasfield ceases
in a few years' time.''
However, he added that the Government was content for Froy gas to come
into the UK, while it was still possible under the Frigg treaty,
pointing out that other companies had purchased part of Froy's
production on that basis.
ScottishPower emphasised it would remain within tightening pollution
limits, in spite of the cancellation of the Froy order.
The Froy gas would have been a relatively small proportion of the
total required when the Longannet project, which involves the injection
of gas above coal combustion areas to reduce emissions of oxides of
nitrogen, comes on stream.

<HEADLINE>Target is to be best global operator as UK is too small for long term growth. BAA looking overseas</HEADLINE>

TODAY Britain, tomorrow the world is the message.
BAA has set its sights on being the best global airports operator and
its track record so far certainly gives it a secure launching pad for
its international aspirations. Britain is demonstrably now too small to
provide long-term growth and BAA's challenges are mainly strategic
rather tactical.
However, there are a few problems looming which are likely to put the
damper on the share price over the next year or so.
In terms of invester sentiment, the public inquiry on the proposed
building of Terminal 5 at Heathrow against much local opposition will
inevitably be messy.
If approved, construction would begin in about a year's time with BAA
already having spent #105m on design work and the bill will have
totalled #170m by the time the inspector's decision is given.
Rejection could mean the whole investment being written off although,
realistically, that does seem unlikely.
There are also the ''small delays'' of a few months on the Heathrow
Expressway linking London directly by rail to the airport after the
tunnelling collapse. Only unkind cynics with Eurotunnel in mind would
expect any prolonged hold-up.
Yesterday's results for the year to March show pre-tax profits rising
13.7% to #366m and were partially fuelled by a 7.1% rise in passenger
numbers to 87.7 million. Coincidentally they were underpinned by the
British Airways traffic figures for May which showed a 6.7% rise in
passenger numbers although these included striking variatons.
Intercontinental roared ahead by 14.8% but short-haul UK and European
was just 3.2% better. The airline's disappointing latter figure was
indirectly explained by BAA saying that it estimated that the Eurostar
Channel Tunnel train business was taking about 25,000 passengers a week
out of the London Paris and Brussels flights.
That is about 10,000 below BAA's worst estimates although it had
expanded the overall tourist demand. Eurotunnel said that it handled 595
Eurstar trains in the month compared with 542 in April.
BAA passenger movements are being hurt by the decline in helicopter
traffic between Aberdeen and the North Sea rigs with the Granite City's
airport seeing a 4.7% decline in the financial year to 2.2 million
passengers. Glasgow was 7.7% ahead at 7.7 million people and will see
further growth as the #40m international pier is fully utilised.
Edinburgh was 8.8% stronger at three million but is suffering from
congestion.
Retail income rose 10% to #362m. But that disguises the disruption
caused by almost all the major termini suffering from building work and
also a softening in turnover rent demands which at one time threatened
to earn BAA the opprobrium of being described as a rapacious landlord.
Average spend per passenger increased by 2.6% to #4.14 but Aberdeen
could force just #1.73 out of passengers, Edinburgh #1.93 with a high
proportion of UK rather than internationally based flights and Glasgow
the most free-spending of the Scots at #2.94.
Retail seems set to develop much more with not only the airport
shopping mall concept being transferred to shopping centres in
greenfield sites but also the development of 45 acres leased from BA in
the Heathrow area. One can be highly relaxed over BAA's ability to
operate airports and act as retail landlords in Britain which has led to
its now having a 10 year contract to manage Indianopolis Airport.
Chief executive Sir John Egan said that the importance of that
agreement was not financial as more a showpiece of how well BAA can
manage airports and so increase its international exposure. Ambitions
include a fair chance of being able to buy one of the east coast
Australian airports as a 49% minority shareholder with Sydney being the
obvious prize given the 2000 Olympics as a major money spinner.
However that would require a rights issue with BAA having enough cash
for its UK expansion plans helped by disposals from the Lynton property
subsidiary's portfolio.
Until the Australian matter is settled the uncertainty that will hang
over the shares will possibly be made worse by competition from Europe.
Vienna airport is now being floated as is Copenhagen's although the
Austrian centre could pose the bigger threat. It is a natural hub for
eastern Europe and as a centre to feed Berlin, Dusselfdorf and Frankfurt
-- all four centres having higher landing charges than Heathrow but
probably able to work happily together.
Dividend prospects are for a slower rate of growth than last year's
12.5% to 10.125p where the yield is 2.6% at 484p. Profits of about #410m
would mean that the shares are selling at just under 16 times likely
earnings on a same again 24% tax charge.
That seemingly somewhat unexciting impost conceals a nasty threat if
the proposed SSAP15 accounting standard is adopted to deal with
unrealised property gains. It could affect all capital intensive
industries. And in the case of BAA, new finance director Russell Walls,
briefly of Wellcome and formerly of Coats Viyella, will see the reserves
written down by perhaps as much as #600m and the likely price earnings
ratio rise to about 18.5.
But that is a non-cash accountancy matter best left to the bean
counters. There is little doubt BAA has the skills to show substantial
profits growth over the years and the shares should be securely retained
despite short term bumpiness.

SHARPLY higher profits from Anglian Water yesterday reignited the
debate about how best to balance the interests of shareholders and
customers.
Profits in the year to end March jumped by almost 64% to #230.1m.
Greater than anticipated cost savings as a result of improved efficiency
led the board to recommend a 14% increase in the total dividend to 26.0p
after a final shareholders' payment of 18p. At the same time customers
who receive both water supply and sewerage are getting a #6 rebate at a
cost to the company of #12m.
During the past 12 months, customers have received #22m from the
company. Over the past five years dividend have risen by 6%-7% in real
terms while over the same period charges have gone up by 5% after taking
inflation into account. The number of customers disconnected in the year
more than halved to 460.
Anglian said it did not want to adopt a formulistic approach to
deciding when and by how much efficiency savings would be passed on to
customers.
Chief executive Alan Smith said that given the uncertainty surrounding
the sector with the possibility of a windfall tax it did not make
commercial sense to make specific promises which may have to be reneged
on at some future date. However, he is confident that the company has
not and never has ''lurched too far one way or the other''.
However, the Labour Party was quick to criticise the customer rebate.
''The balance between the interests of the shareholders and directors
and those of the consumers has been completely lost,'' said Jack
Cunningham, Shadow Trade and Industry Secretary. He added that he would
see industry regulator Ian Bayatt later this week to discuss proposals
''for a tougher and fairer regulatory regime''. Labour is thought to be
considering regulatory reform.
But Anglia's finance director Chris Mellor said there were ''grave
dangers'' in regulating profits rather than prices as is currently the
case. He said such a regulatory regime would ''destroy incentives to cut
costs''. Mr Mellor believes that while the present system is not perfect
it just needs fine-tuning and that companies need to be sensitive to the
balance between customers and shareholders.
Perhaps with an eye on the possibility of a Labour government the
company has decided that it would prefer to have its balance sheet
geared up with debt rather than equity and so it is proposing to seek
powers at its AGM in July to buy-back up to 10% of its shares at a cost
of #120m. This would take its gearing up to around 70% compared with 38%
at the year-end. However, there would be long-term financial and tax
efficiency gains from such a change in the capital structure.
Anglian has been more successful than expected in controlling costs
and improving efficiency. Its 10-year capital expenditure programme is
likely to cost #2700m compared with earlier forecasts of #3500. This
improvement in efficiency has been at the cost of jobs which have
declined by 900 during the year.
Profits in the core regulated water and sewerage business rose by 53%
to #262.8m on turnover up just 6% to #629.7m. Its unregulated businesses
continue to be unprofitable. The process engineering business has
suffered from difficult market conditions in both the UK and Germany.
New management has been installed and redundancies have been made. Its
made a loss of #3.4m compared with a profit of #2.3m in 1994.
Anglian is still establishing a foothold in overseas markets and so
its international losses rose to #2.9m from #1.5m. It already has a
presence in New Zealand and North America on which it wishes to build.
In addition it is looking at opportunities in 10 other markets.
Investment in the international business is to be doubled to #6m over
the next few years. Mr Smith believes that it is vital for the company
to establish a profitable stream of unregulated income in the future.
The international market available to Anglian is estimated to be worth
around #10bn with most of the competition for contracts coming from
other UK water companies. Anglian is moving away from design and build
projects into higher margin concession and system acquisition business.
Anglian shares jumped by 12p to 543p where they yield 6%, reflecting the
City's pleasure at the higher than expected dvidend and news of the
proposed share buy-back.
Four other water companies report their annual results this week.

THERE had to be something fishy when an Edinburgh company went to
China with a mission organised by Glasgow Chamber of Commerce.
The Scottish Fisherman's Organisation signed up for a place on board
last month's trip to Beijing and netted the expedition's only major
catch -- a #5m order for frozen herring and mackerel.
From its Edinburgh headquarters, the organisation markets the catch of
about 600 fishing boats.
The only other deal clinched by the mission was a #250,000 contract
for Training International Scotland, a Glasgow-based company which
specialises in vocational education and training.
All the other participants came home empty handed and will have to
cast their nets again into the Chinese waters if they want to land a
juicy contract.
''It does take the investment of time in market research and
identification and an element of business planning to accommodate the
market opportunity,'' said Glasgow Chamber of Commerce chief executive
and mission leader Geoff Runcie.

THE small shareholder who is seeking to regulate boardroom pay at Bank
of Scotland yesterday acknowledged that the bank was not generally
guilty of making excessive awards to directors.
Meanwhile, Bank of Scotland moved swiftly to prevent itself being
caught up in the public outcry over directors' remuneration, which has
focused on British Gas.
It issued a statement explaining the 16% increase in Governor Sir
Bruce Pattullo's total emoluments, to #377,000, in the year to
end-February.
In an interview, Sir Bruce said: ''The level of directors'
remuneration in Bank of Scotland has not been a matter of controversy.''
And the bank defended a proposed change in its regulations which will
prevent small shareholders individually putting forward resolutions at
future annual general meetings.
Shareholder John Mann, who worked for Clydesdale Bank for 42 years,
admitted that his motion on boardroom pay had a ''nil'' chance of
success at Bank of Scotland's annual meeting in two weeks' time.
Mr Mann, of Bearsden, said he had exploited the somewhat unique
loophole in the bank's regulations, which until now has allowed people
like himself to propose resolutions individually, to keep up the
pressure on other companies which are paying ''obscene'' increases.
Bank of Scotland, which was established by an Act of Parliament, will
require any future resolution to have the support of at least 100
proprietors (shareholders) collectively holding shares with a nominal
value of #10,000, equivalent to a market value of #92,600.
The bank's move, which requires the support of shareholders at an
extraordinary general meeting immediately after the agm, will bring it
into line with groups governed by the Companies Act.
Alternatively, a proprietor or proprietors holding 5% or more of the
total voting rights may propose a resolution.
The outcry over directors' pay reached a climax last week, with
British Gas chief executive Cedric Brown lambasted over the 71% increase
in his total salary and benefits, to #492,602 last year.
Top brass at engineering group Rolls-Royce have also been given a
roasting.
Referring to the pay rises awarded to Bank of Scotland directors last
year, Mr Mann said: ''I think they are quite fair. I am trying to keep
it fair.''
The bank's total directors' remuneration bill grew by 9% to #880,000
last year.
Mr Mann, a member of the UK Shareholders' Association, which aims to
give private individuals a voice, proposes that future increases in
total directors' emoluments, including share options, should not exceed
the sum of half the increase payable to Bank of Scotland's ordinary
shareholders plus half the average increase in employees' pay.
His only point of contention is the 52% increase in the total
emoluments of former Governor Sir Thomas Risk, to #296,000, in the year
to end-February 1992. This included special payments to cover a
shortfall in the retiring Governor's pension.
Mr Mann is disappointed that the bank intends to take away the right
of a small shareholder to individually propose a resolution.
However, Bank of Scotland said the change, which would stop any single
shareholder generating publicity for a particular cause celebre which
had no relevance to the bank itself, would not stop valid concerns being
expressed by proprietors.
Defending Sir Bruce's pay rise, Bank of Scotland pointed out that
about half of the rise in his total emoluments was the result of
increased payments under the staff profit-sharing scheme.
The percentage of basic salary paid to all employees under this scheme
rose from 6.6% to 13.8% in the year to end-February, as a result of the
bank achieving record pre-tax profits of #450m.

NOTES and coins in circulation have recorded their largest monthly
increase since September last year. It could herald a lifting of the
gloom overhanging High Street shopping this year.
The narrow measure of the money supply, M0, fell by a seasonally
adjusted 0.1% last month taking the annual rate of increase down from
6.2% in April to 5.9%.
But the weakness in the money supply figures was all down to a sharp
drop in bankers' deposits, always an erratic element in the data.
Cash in circulation -- the more meaningful constituent of M0 -- rose
by 0.9% with the annual rate of increase picking up from 5.8% to 6.3%.
The three-month annualised rate was 7.7%. It bottomed out at at 3.3% in
January.
The figures have little policy significance ahead of tomorrow's
meeting between the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the
Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George.
The two men are thought to have been at loggerheads over interest
rates at their meeting in May when Mr Clarke came down against a rise in
rates.
The jump in notes and coins in circulation is likely to be well down
the agenda at tomorrow's meeting. The Chancellor will be preoccupied by
the sorry state of the housing market and lack-lustre shopping returns
from the High Street.
The Governor is less bearish about the general state of the economy,
but is perturbed at the potential inflationary consequences of
sterling's sharp decline this year.
The betting in the City is that the bulk of the fresh evidence on the
economy over the last month will strengthen the Chancellor's hand should
the Governor press for a rate hike.
The buoyancy of notes and coins in circulation was all the more
surprising because the recent rises in interest rates should have
increased consumers' incentive to bank spare cash.
One solution to the puzzle being suggested in the City is the
introduction of the National Lottery where tickets are generally
purchased with cash.
But James Capel's Adam Cole pointed out that lottery spending would
generally be at the expense of low-ticket items which are equally likely
to be purchased with cash.
The monitoring range for M0 is 0% to 4%, but the authorities have been
turning a blind eye to the excesses of this monetary measure, especially
as broad money has been weak and well within its monitoring range of 3%
to 9%.
Goldman Sach's David Walton took the view that the M0 figures were
''almost certainly distorted by the introduction of the National
Lottery.''
Nevertheless he said that the acceleration in the growth rate of notes
and coins appeared worrying, particularly ''as this aggregate should be
slowing as a result of higher interest rates.''
Cole argued that M0 had an excellent track record as a leading
indicator of inflation. ''Although the growth rate of overall M0 has
decelerated somewhat in recent months, it remains at a level
historically associated with an acceleration in core inflation over the
next two years.''

WEIR Group yesterday announced a joint venture in China to build heavy
duty pumps for the mining and mineral processing industries.
The Glasgow-based firm said its Dutch subsidiary, EnviroTech
Pumpsystems Netherlands NV, had taken a 51% stake in a new company
called Lanzhou Lanshi Geho Pumpsystems, based at Lanzhou in central
China.
Its Chinese partner, the Lanzhou Petroleum and Chemical Machinery
Equipment and Engineering Group Corp, already manufactures similar pumps
at Lanzhou.
A Weir Group spokesman said EnviroTech would ship out components for
the manufacture of more advanced models of pump on existing production
lines.
The Chinese joint venture would make a very small contribution to the
Weir Group's expected #300m sales of pumps this year, he added, without
disclosing an exact figure.

BRITISH Polythene Industries (BPI), the Greenock-based manufacturer of
food wrappings, yesterday announced its fifth acquisition this year.
BPI said it had bought the polythene film business of the
Halifax-based firm A-Fax for #2m, but would not acquire a new factory.
Finance director John Langlands said A-Fax's machinery for
manufacturing shrink film and stretch film would be relocated at
existing BPI plants in northern England.
About 40 people involved in making the stretchable material that is
used to keep merchandise such as beer cans on pallets while in transit
would had been offered new jobs with BPI at other locations.
A-Fax produced 7800 tonnes of transparent shrink film and stretch film
per year worth about #7m.
BPI controls a quarter of the UK polythene products market and has
grown rapidly through acquisitions.
It bought seven companies for #6m last year and has so far spent a
further #6.5m this year on buying five more companies.
''I certainly doubt that this will be our last acquisition this
year,'' Mr Langlands said.
BPI's leading customers include Tesco, Sainsbury, Safeway, Asda, and
Marks &amp; Spencer.
BPI sells carrier bags and other items directly to these chain stores,
but also makes wrappings for the food packing firms which supply them.
Despite a sharp rise in raw material costs last year, the company
boosted its pre-tax profit by 25% to #19.2m on turnover of #269m.
BPI shares rose 1p to 586p.

THE Cottier Theatre has recently been attracting a good deal of public
attention with its burgeoning programme, and on Sunday night its first
choral concert, featuring the City of Glasgow Chorus, revealed yet
another facet for potential development.
The presence there of this particular choir was explained quite
ingenuously by their conductor and musical director, Graham Taylor. He
announced that a concert of works by Puccini and Poulenc had been
aborted at the GRCH through a lack of box-office interest and so here
they were to give his singers something to do. There certainly was
plenty for them to do trying to inject some freshness into this
selection of Choral Classics, a pot-pourri of every family's favourite
choruses by Handel, Haydn, Mozart, and Brahms, to name but a few.
The first number, Zadok The Priest, did not augur well, the voices
earthbound beneath the organ playing of John Langdon, substituting for
orchestral accompaniment. In Mozart's Ave Verum Corpus however, face was
recovered with a more discreet relationship between organ and the
various sections of the chorus.
Indeed this was the pattern for the evening, with the big, faster
pieces generally morphing in to mushy confused textures, while the
slower and medium-paced works achieved an impressive delicacy of balance
and transparency. Highlights of the programme were both for
unaccompanied voices, Bruckner's Motet Ave Marie and a Sanctus by
Schubert. And just to prove this chorus can handle the big, fast,
complex ones, they finished strongly on Handel's Worthy Is The Lamb.

BIG talk is the genius of American democracy. Big talk, loud talk,
crazy talk, free talk. Once there was no greater exponent of all these
elements than the New York cabbie but, alas, not any more. Despite its
raucous imperatives -- indeed perhaps because of them -- New York has
now bred a type of cab driver who believes in eliminating verbal contact
altogether.
Of course, this could be because he speaks no English. Even if the
passenger can converse effervescently in Spanish or Cantonese this won't
necessarily propel the cabbie into geniality, for more than any other
fellow he lives and breathes every vibration in the clamour of his city,
every rattle and hum in its racket, as millions stream along the
sidewalk all shrieking at once for his attention while others jam
streets and avenues in an ever-expanding rush hour or vain search for
parking space.
Quite simply the New York cabbie is volcanic with stress, silent on
the surface, but one wrong word in his direction and the peptic
aggression fizzes, ready to explode. Even that snappy old opener: OK,
where to? is now much more than he can muster. Today it is accepted New
York practice to catch a cab, state the destination, and sink back on
battered springs, anxiously observing the driver's look of glum
hostility in the mirror.
On regarding the tip, however, he may just rouse himself to oratory.
Up at the Lincoln Centre a cab driver is hurling out of the window a
couple of dollar bills given as a bonus: Keep the money, he shouts to
the puzzled decanted customer, adding, for the benefit of pedestrians: I
tell you, this guy's a tight-assed creep. By now a traffic cop is on his
tail, roaring at him to move his butt to let some paramedics through.
New York isn't a city, it's a drama of hopeful arrival, longing, and
loss.
But these are hardly the qualities of tourist heaven, and yet,
desperate to generate cash and renew itself again, this is precisely
what New York aspires to be. We want to dispel the image that our city
is a cold, inhospitable place, says Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and to this
end he has launched a training campaign to convert New Yorkers into
convivial folk who are nice to the 25 million visitors passing through
Manhattan each year.
More than 50,000 city employees, including policemen, are being
schooled over a five-year period in the importance of being civil. But
for cabbies, the sensitivity programme has already begun: 10,000
spiced-apple air fresheners have been distributed to drivers for use in
their vehicles, each sachet stamped with the expansive claim, New York
welcomes the world.
And so it does, in one sense. Nearly all New Yorkers have come from
somewhere else because their energy and spirit of adventure proved too
strong to detain them at home. As a result every race problem imaginable
simmers there yet tribal hatred is not the city's consuming feature.
Instead it possesses a remarkable state of truce which, on the whole,
holds good. Even so, surveys carried out by the Convention and Visitors
Bureau indicate that local rudeness ranks high among deterrents to
repeat vacations.
But there are always those who delight in the city's irascibility. At
the Madison Avenue Deli the waiters, arms akimbo, are expressing their
impatience with guests dawdling over the menu: Please, we're turning to
stone here. What do you think we're running? A twilight home? And for
this kind of reprimand people queue to the door.
Back on the cab rank it requires more than spicy-apple vapours to
sweeten drivers out of mute contempt. For a start, they see most
tourists as sidewalk pilgrims. And, anyway, they have weightier matters
in mind than remembering to simper.
They must concentrate on avoiding not just emergency traffic and
potholes but bullying garbage trucks and that snarl-up on Fifth where a
gunman is demanding sanctuary in Saks, or that road block on Mott Street
where another has just decapitated a woman with an ornamental sword.
And it does not help that when hotel doormen summon cabbies they do so
not with a comradely wave but a rape whistle.
No wonder they feel the target of everybody's venom. Smile? Welcome
the possibility of even more nutters sitting directly behind their
heads? Chatter about the weather, the exchange rate mechanism? Naw.
Manners? Bristling with silence, the New York cabbie would rather give
up than be polite.

IT may seem a bit late in the day to analyse now the consequences of
the trade unions' relationship with the last Labour Government in
explaining that Government's electoral defeat. John Edmonds of the GMB
was, however, really looking forward to the next Labour Government in
his remarks yesterday. He was asking for ''fairness, not favours'' and
identified four specific areas of immediate union concern, which a new
Government would probably want to address anyway -- union recognition at
GCHQ in Cheltenham; the protection of striking workers from dismissal, a
general concession of employee rights, and a national minimum wage.
Labour has already argued for these positions, though it is still
unwilling to specify the exact wage it would establish as the national
minimum. It should certainly do so before the next election, for though
it is possible to accept a vague commitment now it would seem strange if
no figure could be quoted for public opinion to endorse or reject. Mr
Blair will be damaged if he enters the next election without some
precise policies.
The relationship between a Labour Government and the unions, between
any Government and the unions justifies consideration. The old
dispensation, which came in during the 1940s, when Churchill brought
Ernest Bevin of the Transport Workers into the Cabinet as Minister of
Labour and Attlee kept him as Foreign Secretary, was that the unions
should always be consulted about national economic policy. The vehicle
for consultation was the TUC, and the process worked rather well until
it broke down during the 1960s and early 70s. It failed then because the
TUC could not control all its members any more than individual unions
could control their rank and file -- both were outflanked by the shop
stewards movement, many of whose leaders had a political agenda of their
own, usually hostile to both traditional union and Labour policies. The
understanding between Labour and the unions was not of itself dishonest,
even if it failed. The Callaghan Government in particular tried very
hard to be fair to British unions and even the Wilson administration's
attempt at reform (which Mr Callaghan helped to frustrate) was not
animated by hostility, but by the need to make improvements to union law
and practice. When these were made by Mrs Thatcher they proved to be
popular, though far more draconian than Mr Wilson's; and Mr Blair seems
unlikely to abandon them.
Trade unions ought to be consulted by Government, especially in the
framing of legislation affecting labour relations. They are an interest
group but Governments have to deal with interest groups all the time.
Labour Governments are more likely to enjoy a closer relationship with
the unions than the Tories, the outcome of history and continuing
financial links, but Mr Edmunds is right to note how the embrace can
become too close, and damaging to both. A rerun of the Wilson-Callaghan
experience is unlikely in the event of another Labour Government. The
reasons are varied. Unions are no longer thirled to theories of
collective ownership or workers' control. They have shrunk in
membership, though still clearly vital to workers' needs. Labour has
changed too, having accepted a market economy but still being anxious to
give it a social market impetus. Mr Edmonds' ''open relationship'' is
perfectly possible, but it was open even in Mr Wilson's day, and that
was not why it failed.

THE last time the London City Ballet danced in Scotland, it was to the
swansong strains of impending doom. At each performance, a member of the
company would gently inform the audience that -- short of a sudden
turnaround in arts council policy -- closure seemed inevitable at the
end of the summer tour.
I can still recall the bewilderment and indignation that greeted this
announcement in both Edinburgh and Glasgow. After a fine triple bill --
which included a welcome revival of Jack Carter's long-neglected Witch
Boy -- I remember two new town ladies tapping me on the shoulder. Was I
a critic? Well then, why was this being allowed to happen?
Why, indeed. It was a response that Harold King, the artistic director
of LCB, encountered in every venue the company visited that season. It
prompted him to go against the grain of what the arts council had
decreed -- and even to oppose his own board of directors when it
declared the company was no longer financially viable. It wasn't simply
a case of preserving jobs, important as that was in a sector of limited
opportunities. It was about keeping ballet alive. About making it
available, in live performances, to audiences throughout the country.
Obviously the fates were on Harold King's side -- or maybe, they too,
were just a little fed up with watching what passes for mainstream
provision being dammed by yet more blueprints for accessible innovation
. . . for, in the course of one telephone conversation, a chink appeared
in that would-be final curtain. The caller had read about the company's
sorry predicament. There was this trust fund . . . would #150,000 help?
It had to be an omen. At any rate, it served to convince King that the
show wasn't over 'til the fat lady danced! He sent the company off on
annual holiday and set about drumming up sufficient sponsorship to start
the operation rolling again when the company returned six weeks later.
Meanwhile, of course, the board -- thinking that the end was nigh --
had told existing sponsors that their monies were no longer required.
King laughs as he recalls contacting them to ask for it all back. But in
fact this exercise produced more than cash alone. ADT -- principal
sponsors throughout 1994/95 -- offered practical assistance in drawing
up a profile of the company's finances and future viability. And so,
armed with sufficiently favourable figures -- and his own cussed
determination to keep LCB afloat -- King challenged the board's decision
to wind up the company.
It's now two years on from that summer of cliffhanger crisis. London
City Ballet is back in Scotland -- Edinburgh this week, Glasgow in a
fortnight's time. So, have the clouds rolled by? Well, no, not entirely.
King is still exasperated by the arts council's attitude to the company.
''After 17 years, you'd think the penny might have dropped. That they
would recognise what it is we represent to our audiences. What it is we
provide. But no. It's as if they don't want to know.''
He speaks, feelingly, of an arts council assessment that seemed to
miss every plus in the company's favour while homing in on any available
weakness. It was, he claims, full of inaccuracies. Wrong dates, wrong
names. Lots of fiddly little details that, taken individually, seemed
insignificant. But, when rolled up together, they shaded in a picture of
a company racketing round the provinces with a product that was either
inadequate or surplus to local requirements. ''Frankly it was a totally
damning report,'' said King with an edge of bitterness. ''When we
challenged it, offered to correct factual inaccuracies, we were told to
go ahead, told that the revisions would be circulated -- in fact that
didn't happen. It was as if we had no comeback whatsoever.
These days the arts council gives LCB #250,000 on the understanding
that it appears at a given roster of venues. These venues, in terms of
audience numbers, are by and large the low points of the touring year.
The money covers the company's loss at the box office. It is, in effect,
salt in a still raw wound. It seems to suggest that as far as the arts
council is concerned the full houses, the supportive loyal audiences
that have kept faith with LCB just don't exist. Fortunately, sponsors
seem to recognise otherwise, though as King admits chasing sponsorship
is a never ending, uphill task. He's thrilled that businesses, large and
small, care to be associated with London City Ballet. The down side
comes, however, in terms of what will keep those businesses dipping into
their pockets. By and large they prefer the company to play safe.
Giselle, has all the right ingredients: marvellous music, a classic
storyline and a second act shimmering with the virtues of ballet blanc.
So far, so good. But King knows that the dancers -- and indeed the
audiences -- can't survive forever on a repetitive diet of favourite
classics. The aim is to attract sponsors willing to support risk and
experiment. A ballet from Paul Mercurio (Strictly Ballroom) per chance?
It's all very well surviving -- and King is truly delighted that he has
managed to keep LCB on the road -- but if ballet is to be truly alive
then the next step forward has to be into the unknown.
* LONDON City Ballet is at the Kings, Edinburgh tonight with Giselle.
It offers a gala programme on Friday/Saturday. The company comes to
Glasgow Kings on June 20 with the same two programmes.

ALISON BIGRIGG of the Centre for Family Planning and Sexual Health
fails to allay my fears and that of many other parents (May 26). She
claims that the new clinic, with user-friendly teenagers on reception,
is meeting a need which already exists and is providing information
which will empower young people to make their own decisions.
Modern counselling techniques are based on values clarification
whereby values are not based on objective rights and wrongs but are
specific to the emotional, psychological, and personal circumstances of
the client.
The job of the counsellor is to help clients clarify what values they
have and adopt a way forward which suits their circumstances. In the
case of children and sexual problems this style of counselling
invariably leads to the route of least resistance, ie, contraception,
abortion, and continuing with under-age sexual relations.
The massive sexual education and counselling industry for children
creates ever greater confusion among our children and inevitably tempts
them further into sexual hooliganism.

trained her tonsils to strangle vowels before they reach her lips.
Yes -- a goodly number of the favourite moments are there, in some
cases lovingly recreated even in detail from the original film version.
Yes, Oh, Yes, -- it is much better than I had feared.
Minutes to curtain up, the inner voice was going nineteen to the
dozen. ''You're not going to like this. You're going to get upset and
angry at what they've done to one of your favourite films. And you're
not a Paul Nicholas fan -- you know you're not . . .'
The inner voice was, at the time, absolutely spot on. Frankly I
couldn't see much point in shunting something as beautifully crafted as
the original off the screen and on to a limiting stage. It smacked of
money-spinning, exploitation, tinkering.
I dreaded the moment when Nicholas, brolly in hand, would attempt to
splash in Gene Kelly's footsteps . . . if ever I was in two minds about
reviewing something, this was it.
Of course, I'm admitting all of this because, by the end, I felt
really quite chipper about the whole event.
I still find Nicholas somewhat unyielding. He works hard, no doubt
about it. He dances with a will, sings as tunefully as he can, attempts
a roguishness in the role of Don Lockwood.
But something doesn't quite relax in his performance. There doesn't
seem to be the elasticity of body or mind that Kelly didn't have to
search for in his performance. That said, when Nicholas does sing and
dance in the rain, he does so with a genial air of ''what the heck'',
gets thoroughly soaked on our behalf, and still shrugs it off.
His performance is more than ably complemented by Shona Lindsay's
fresh, appealling Kathy and Tony Howe's goofy Cosmo, though Ms Payne's
Lina comes close to stealing the whole caboodle.
Best of all, however, is the staging: lavish costuming, clever sets
that conjure up the glamour of those bygone Hollywood days. By the end
my cold front had lifted -- Singin' In The Rain is a splash hit in its
own terms.

THEY don't come more dangerous or daring than this. Deborah Warner,
Fiona Shaw, and Hildegard Bechtler's Richard II is one of the most
thrilling Shakespeares I can remember. Like it or hate it, this Richard
II will be remembered not only for Shaw's playing of the fated king but
for Warner/Bechtler's remarkable staging of it.
A long narrow, brass and wood jousting corridor with audience piled
high on either side, it's not however just the combatative environment
that sets the blood racing, thrilling though it is. Warner has made a
production that gets right under the skin so that, as she has always
promised, being present becomes in every sense an unmistakably
theatrical event -- unrepeatable in any other medium.
Nor is gender really an issue here. Beneath an androgynous costume of
white and gold, Shaw's femaleness becomes subsumed into a quixotic
portrait of wanton, flawed kingship -- irresponsible, immature,
nervously plucking humour out of the deepest abyss of despair. Never has
the actual scene of abdication carried more poignancy with Shaw
manufacturing a joke even as she hands David Threlfall's velvet-voiced
Bolingbroke the crown.
Even so, and backed up as this hurtling production is with quality in
depth -- Graham Crowden as John of Gaunt, Michael Bryant as a
wonderfully distracted, bad-tempered Duke of York, and Paoloa Dionisotti
stunning as both the ancient Duchess of Gloucester and garrulous Duchess
of York -- the Bolingbroke conundrum remains unanswered.
Gentler, though no less ruthless, Threlfall's reluctant Bolingbroke is
king, it seems, almost by default. Richard's abdication is one more of
self-destruction than through Bolingbroke's ambition. Nothing new there,
but the manner in which we see it is dynamically unique and utterly
compelling.

THIS postgraduate show prompts me to wax lyrical: great work
beautifully displayed, awesome in its professionalism and although
broadly conceptual in nature, it has enough body to feed the eyes as
well as the brain. The 13 postgraduates come from Belgium, Poland,
Ireland, Germany, India, England, and Scotland. Their specialities range
from painting to video; their media from tapes to toast. The thread
which connects them is an intelligent reappraisal of memory.
Angus Miller scatters elegant but misshaped wax amphora vessels across
the floor, their hi-tech black bases likewise fragmented. Poles apart
from this sensitive historical reworking, are a row of soppy Tell Us A
Story Greyfriar's Bobby dogs.
International artist Calum Colvin's action man has provided him with
an entire career. Here John Beagles's placard parading toy figures sport
slogans while more text appears via magnetic nursery letters.
Nathalie de Briey's old blue toy musical rabbit inspires a successful
sound piece. She also uses needle and thread to make her mark, with text
sewn into socks and hankies to give traditional embroidery an edge.
Caroline Woodley too, unashamedly harks back to childhood with Model
Islands based on miniature farm cottages enhanced by King Kong-size
rabbits overlooking a tower block.
More sophisticated are Shauna McMullen's quite brilliant lacy bread
slices and Suzanne Ramsenthaler's trio of stunning black and white
photographs, their boldly patterned arabesques of dried, curled leaves
and flowers animated by light. Less impressive are Gray's reworking of
Julie Roberts's operating table and McCall's simplistic art world pixs.
''Imagine yourself drawing a blank,'' says Beagles. This lot? Never!

Mary Brennan finds Northern Ballet Theatre is coming on leaps and
bounds -- by scrapping the artistic gymnastics of the classical form.
CHRISTOPHER GABLE gleefully assumes a momentary air of bewilderment
before springing into the saddle of a favourite hobbyhorse: ''What is it
about the ballet world? I mean, if you take theatre -- Shakespeare's
accepted world-wide as the great playwright. Nobody's afraid to
reinterpret that work. Or opera. Look at what Jonathan Miller did with
Rigoletto, setting it in Chicago.
''Now that's all about looking at your material, and finding the right
touch for today's audiences. And the ballet world seems to have closed
its doors to that. There's a tiny repertoire. What is it -- five, maybe
six, full ballets. And the major companies all do them -- and they do
them the same!''
Phew! Gable is in tornado mode. Positive about the values he
encourages within this own company -- Northern Ballet Theatre -- and
unrepentently scathing about those he reckons are silting up the
arteries of classical ballet in this country. His words leap and
pirouette at speed as he questions the ultimate purpose of a highly
wrought technique. ''Who is it for actually? Audiences? I really don't
think so. I think people get fed up watching nothing but artistic
gymnastics. It's a competitive thing, between dancers, to see who can
pull off the tricks higher, faster, longer. And it's exciting for a
while, to watch. But in the end, what you lose are the emotions.
''You have these great ballets -- full of conflict and wonderful
romance, if you look at the stories -- and they end up sterile.
Over-stylised. And full of this kind of technical point-scoring that
only an expert could access. And face it -- there aren't that many
experts. But there are people, audiences who want to see dance that
means something to them. And that's what NBT is all about.''
In part, his enthusiasm for dance with a distinctly theatrical agenda
stems from his own career experiences. Back in the sixties Gable walked
away from a successful niche as a soloist with the Royal Ballet. He
turned, instead, to acting. After working with such radical forces as
Peter Brook and Ken Russell it's hardly surprising that his
disenchantment with shows of balletic puissance took on dramatic form.
When he arrived at the helm of Northern Ballet Theatre, this viewpoint
rapidly became the linchpin of a strategy for survival. The Basilisk eye
of the Arts Council was yet again casting around for companies to freeze
out of the funding race. Gable -- refusing to let NBT be dismissed as
expendable -- set about establishing a distinctive repertoire that
didn't simply dance at the heels of the larger London-based companies.
Even when -- as with Romeo and Juliet -- he dipped into traditional
ballet territory, he made sure no-one would be likely to confuse the NBT
staging with, say, the versions made by Ashton, Cranko or McMillan.
In truth -- as he readily points out -- he didn't have the numbers to
emulate that kind of classic spectacular. ''Twenty guys in orange . . .
20 guys in navy . . . all scrapping away in the background . . . we only
had 10 boys in the entire company! There was no way we could take that
approach. And in any case, I wanted something that modern audiences
could look at and think -- 'Yes, I know what that's about.' Something
like, say, a street brawl in Liverpool, where the women get drawn in,
and there's head butting and a general free-for-all rammy!''
He also wanted a different kind of dance vocabulary. He explains why.
Classical technique has a very specific kind of beauty to it. All those
renaissance values of line and harmony. But the symmetry doesn't exactly
lend itself to the agonies and griefs of everyday life. Not in the way
that, for instance, Graham does. I wanted a choreographer who could tap
into that kind of physicality. Someone who could make fuller use of the
dancers' bodies, bring out all the guts and passion of the story.''
That person was a young Italian choreographer, Massimo Moricone. The
resulting production subsequently proved a real winner for the company.
Gable himself is full of praise for what Moricone achieved -- not least
because he reckons it was a less than satisfactory process for the
Italian.
''Essentially he was providing a vocabulary for someone else's vision.
Mine.'' Gable sounds a shade rueful. Obviously, given the effectiveness
of Romeo and Juliet it would have been nice to think that a hit-making
team had come on stream.
These days, the creative process attached to making new work is kept
within the company. ''It's all in-house! Preliminary discussions about
the scenario, the choreography, the staging, they all generate out of
this marvellous resource: the company itself. And I think that really
shines through when we are on stage, because we've already shared so
much, invested so much in bringing the piece into being.''
And, waiting in the wings -- ready to contribute -- are the students
from what is now the company's feeder school, the Central School of
Ballet which Gable helps to run. There the regime of ballet, jazz, tap
-- even singing and drama -- predicts the kind of versatility expected
of NBT company members.
Glasgow audiences can see for themselves some of the future strengths
of NBT when Ballet Central comes to the Mitchell on Saturday, June 10.
The company proper is at Glasgow's Theatre Royal tonight with their
award-winning production of Romeo and Juliet.

SHOP assistant Mohammed Sadiq told Glasgow District Court he did not
realise he was doing 102 mph on a stretch of the M8 motorway.
Sadiq (39), of 45 Leander Crescent, Mossend, Bellshill, Lanarkshire,
admitted driving at excessive speed on the M8 between Junctions 9 and 10
on October 14 last year.
The court heard that on a wet and dark evening police monitored Sadiq
driving at 102 mph for about quarter of a mile before he was stopped by
the officers.
An agent said Sadiq was not in any particular hurry and had not
realised he was driving at such a speed. He was married with one child
and employed as a shop assistant.
Sadiq was banned from driving for one year and fined #250.
EH bien, mes copains, revenons a nos moutons. Or to put it another
way, here we are on again about the 700th anniversary of the Auld
Alliance. (No, we are not going to mention any recent Rugby World Cup
matches.)
At the behest of M Jean-Claude Richard, the French consul in Scotland,
we asked you to recall stories or anecdotes which typified the special
relationship between Scotland and France. There have been many letters
exploring historical, cultural, and sporting themes.
But before we get serious let's have a typical slice of life via this
contribution from Mary Kelly of Burnside: ''During the Second World War,
a battalion of Free French troops was stationed close to our home, a
small mining village in deepest South Ayrshire. A young lady of the
village, Henrietta Dalton (not her real name, she might read The Herald)
spent much of her leisure time in the company of the French soldiers.''
So plenteous were her alliances that when the headmaster of the
village primary school asked the senior class ''Who is the leader of the
Free French?'' they unanimously chorused ''Henrietta Dalton''.
Also from deepest Ayrshire we hear from Bill Baillie of Cumnock who
recalls summer schools which brought together local pupils and their
French counterparts. One of the activities was Scotland vs France
football matches.
Mr Baillie was refereeing one such game when an Ayrshire player in
midfield bawled to his goalie: ''Haw, Jock, hit it a blooter.'' At which
a French boy turned to him and asked: ''M'sieu, Qu'est-ce que c'est
blooter?''
We will get on to the cultural stuff at some point soon, honest.
Meanwhile there is good news on the prize front. Consul Richard has
already organised two Air France return tickets to Paris and a lunch for
two at Le Chardon restaurant in Edinburgh.
His latest piece of fixing is to arrange a visit for one of our
winners to a North Sea oil platform operated by French company Elf.
Appealing to the more adventurous of our readers, this will involve a
helicopter flight from Aberdeen to the platform, a complete tour of the
installation, and then back to dry land for a spot of lunch.
Keep your Auld Alliance entries coming in to the Diary at the usual
address. We will announce the winners of the various prizes to coincide
with the departure later this month of M Richard to take up his promoted
post as ambassador to Uzbekistan.
Dishing it out
THE Higher Geography exams, papers being marked as we write, contained
a question asking pupils to expound upon the industrial decline of the
city of Sheffield. One hopeful wrote that the Sheffield factories worked
full blast during the Second World War to provide the wherewithal to
defeat the Hun and the Japs but ''after the war was over there wasn't
such a demand for cutlery''.
We had heard of armies marching on their stomachs but never fighting
battles with knife and fork.
Grape expectations
IT is obviously all part of some grand plan. In the week that Paul
Gascoigne announces that he will definitely join Rangers, Marks &amp;
Spencer have sent a leaflet to customers extolling the virtues of one of
their wines -- Vin de Pays du Gers from the Gascony region of France.
Soft pedalling
DEPT of We Hope We Know What They Mean: From the Netherlands Youth
Hostelling Association brochure on cycling trips around the Zuiderzee --
''The first night you sleep in the hostel in Den Oever, at the feet of
the big enclosing dyke . . .''
Rough justice
ONE of the delights of the Rugby World Cup is listening to the
commentaries on Radio Scotland. Bill Johnston, the man at the mike, is
like Bill McLaren on speed. Or maybe ecstasy. Or maybe a whole cocktail
of drugs.
On Saturday afternoon he advised listeners on car radios who may have
driven into a ditch after Scotland went 13-3 up on France just to stay
in the ditch and listen to the rest of the match.
Mr Johnston is very fond of intoning Afrikaans words and is forever
telling us about the high drama in the high veldt.
He is also into fish. Players at the line-outs invariably rise into
the air ''like Tweed salmon''. Players attempting to avoid opponents in
a bid to cross the score line wriggle ''like eels''.
Borderer Bill has a euphemistic way of describing the murder and
mayhem on the field. Players in the ruck exchanging blows of which Mike
Tyson would be proud are said to be indulging ''in a spot of mischief''.
A player whose shirt and back have been ripped to shreds by an
opponent's studs has been ''receiving the attention of a stray French
boot''.
It's a shame we have only the one match to go.
Out on a wing
SOME days we toil at the coal face of all human life but fail to come
up with anything quite as interesting as the small ads which feature in
our own dear Herald. Like this from last week's pets for sale: ''African
grey parrot, five years old, due to bereavement, speaks like the former
so forces wife to sell . . .''
Song of praise
GREAT Corrections of Our Times: The Evening Standard of London,
reviewing the play Scottish Dumbstruck at the Lyric theatre, Hampstead,
said: ''Jimmy Chisholm is appalling as the hyperactively egotistical
singer Johnny . . .'' But the likeable Mr Chisholm, of Take the High
Road and sundry panto fame, need not have worried. The paper then issued
an apology stating that they meant to say he was ''appealing''.
Peace reigns
WE are pleased to see that Central Regional Council's women's and
equal opportunities committee meeting planned for next week has been
cancelled ''due to the lack of business on the agenda''. This can only
mean that the battle against sexism and other discrimination has finally
been won in Central region. And the Diary feels quite proud to have
played a small part over all the years. We would just like to say:
''Well, done, dears.''

HARRIS in June, and the people have spoken. Summer is jerking in,
rather late; but the new grass is coming, and the lambs are fattening,
and the air is warm as milk. The last of the snow is gone from the
mountains. And the mountains stand high and proud, from the barren keel
of Clisham to the rump of Roineabhal.
Roineabhal is not as high as Clisham, which is only 200ft or so short
of a Munro. But Roineabhal is the better viewpoint, probably the best in
the Western Isles. Anyone who visits Harris should climb Roineabhal, and
many do, for sight of the great beaches of the west, and the bleak rock
of the east, and the Sound of Harris south, bejewelled with islands, and
Skye, and Wester Ross, and so on, and so forth. Roineabhal anchors South
Harris. Like a big mother hen it huddles over Leverburgh. When you are
bowling through Skye towards the ferry at Uig, and first glimpse the
Harris hills, Roineabhal is the last on the left. With gentle emphasis,
and like a mighty bookend, Roineabhal sets off the profile of home.
The trouble is that Roineabhal is largely composed of a very useful
rock, meta-anorthosite. In the past, above a township called Lingerbay,
this stuff has been quarried; it was then best regarded as an abrasive,
the scouring core of Ajax and similar useful things. Today, anorthosite
is sought as the prince of aggregates. It is hard, tarmacadam, for roads
and piers and motorways and skyscrapers and other useful things.
The world needs aggregate. However, the world is most reluctant to
have aggregate quarried beside it. There are big bangs, and much dust
and vibration; you end up with an enormous hole in the ground and
no-one, with the best will in the world, could describe a quarry as
pretty.
Now, unless you have been living on the moon for the past decade, you
will have heard of Redlands Aggregates and their plans for a vast
superquarry at Lingerbay, South Harris. You will have heard that the
enterprise, once under way, would be worked for some 60 years; that
hundreds of thousands of tons of Roinbeabhal were to be borne away, and
that a new sea loch would be cut in at Lingerbay, with a removed island
or two, and that, at the end of it all, there would be a hole in the
east coast of Harris the size of the Empire State building.
The Lingerbay quarry would have been the largest in Europe and, in
time, perhaps the largest in the world. It was a project so big, of such
a scale and to be executed over such length of time, that it was hard
fully to comprehend. One's first reaction was awe. Then, as one thought,
the awe turned to something akin to fear.
Over three years I have on at least three occasions used this column
to raise the Lingerbay superquarry and to argue for its opening. For
this I make no apology. First: I never forgot the accelerating
depopulation of our island, nor could I thole the sight of our young
people pouring away to the mainland and never coming home, for want of
work. Second: I was never convinced by the arguments of quarry
opponents.
No convincing proof was offered for their wild tales of carcinogenic
dust, virus-laden ballast water or house-shattering earth-tremors. A
perfectly good planning agreement, with all the force of law, was
tediously hammered out in 1993. Most of all, I resented many aspects of
the anti-quarry lobby. Most of the objectors lived furth of Harris;
many, indeed, furth of Scotland. Too often they conveyed an impression
of Harris as a pretty theme-park for their fleeting summer visits, and
that the more depopulated it became the prettier it would be.
The local opposition, until very recently, came almost entirely from
our migrant community. I have nothing against white settlers: indeed,
after two years in Harris, I now feel another couple of hundred could do
the world of good. But people living comfortably on pensions and
investments lack the moral authority to deny gainful employment to
others. More recently our local fishermen decided to oppose the project,
genuinely frightened by tales of pollution and toxin. (But the coast of
Norway, dotted with massive superquarries, has the most efficient
fishing industry on earth.)
In 1993, then, following completion of a bombproof planning agreement,
the Harris people were offered a referendum. To the surprise of many the
superquarry proposal was endorsed. I felt, and still feel, that the
Quarry Benefits Group -- as our local lobby now styled itself -- should
have paid more regard to this poll during the recent public inquiry, and
resisted its developing internatal bias against Redlands Aggregates and
the superquarry.
I regretted some aspects of the QBG's conduct during hearings at
Stornoway and Leverburgh. When, a few weeks ago, they suddenly called a
second referendum, I felt it was precipitate; that a poll should have
followed publication of the Reporter's findings and, for maximum effect,
perhaps even the final decision of the Secretary of State. The period
given for issue and return of ballots was far too short. It coincided
with at least two public holidays and a chaotic postal strike. Many
ballots had to be issued twice. My own voting paper, rebounding from
Harris to Edinburgh by first-class redirection of mail, reached me on
May 18 with a letter asking for its return by the 17th. (I posted it,
first class, within the hour, but I have no idea if it was counted or
even if it reached.)
Yet I cannot argue with the vote. In 1993, on a turnout of 60.9%,
Harris voters approved the superquarry by 62.1% to 37.9%. In 1995 no
less than 82.7% of the voting roll -- a turnout seldom matched in a
General Election -- responded exhorting the Secretary of State to reject
the Lingerbay quarry by a thumping 67.7% to 32.3%. Such a poll is
emphatic and final. Barring some astonishing development, it is hard to
imagine a change of heart in the community. They no longer trust
Redlands Aggregates, they are scunnered by the vacillating incompetence
of the Western Isles Islands Council, and they are sick and bored to
death of the whole tedious debate.
My one regret is for the near-third of the populace who voted for the
quarry. Over the past few months they have been denied leadership or
encouragement, against a sweeping tide of propaganda, fibs, and fantasy.
Not a single public meeting, as the May poll took place, was called to
rally support for the Lingerbay project. At one meeting I attended in
April 1992, folk were dancing from the floor to defend the scheme
against the nuttier objections of incomers and strangers. Where did
these people go? Only three of us, to my knowledge, at the last spoke
publicly for the project. But the poll, convincing as it is, shows we
spoke for a substantial minority of the Harris people -- and, indeed, on
the basis of the 1993 referendum, for what had been the plain majority.
The cause is lost, the battle ended. It is time for the fuss to die
down and for healing to begin. I will not argue for the quarry again. At
the last, it was a decision for all in Harris and that decision has been
firmly made. If the Secretary of State is foolish enough to foist the
superquarry upon us, regardless, then I will be first to man the
barricades.
It is when I eye the empty houses, or gaze at the vacant face of a lad
whose horizons are reduced to beer and the dole, that something will
twist in my gut.

AFTER my column about executive pay and the ethics of National Grid
directors sheltering their rewards from tax by transferring shares, not
yet available to the public, into their wives' names, I bumped into a
businessman friend at a corporate dinner.
He has, down the years, offered constructive comment and welcome
advice about various things I've written. We know each other well enough
to call spades shovels and skin blemishes boils and warts. He was, he
told me amid the black-tied hubble a week ago Friday, unhappy about my
latest effort. ''More than a whiff of envy in there, Alf,'' he ventured.
He was seriously misreading the public mood of growing hostility
towards such corporate excesses, I countered. I further suggested that
if, as a card-carrying Tory with a strong independent-minded streak, he
could not see the problem and the political dangers it carries, his
party and its remaining supporters really are sleepwalking to a rude
awakening at the next election. He promised to read the offending piece
again.
There our brief encounter ended. But our exchange has troubled me ever
since. It nagged away as I watched small shareholders passionately vent
their anger at the British Gas agm, ire reduced to impotence by the
blockbuster proxies from City institutions already tucked into chairman
Richard Giordano's pocket. It erupted again as I listened to the woman
from ProShare on radio insist: ''Why should these small shareholders
expect to win? After all they only own 20% of gas shares.''
It re-emerged when, predictably, it was revealed that, among those
institutions backing the BG board on executive pay were the pension
funds of the Post Office, British Telecom, and the BBC. Bet that came as
a surprise to the many postmen, call operators, and studio staff without
whom these funds simply wouldn't exist. It may even have shaken the
ProShare spokeswoman who, it appeared, had not quite worked out that
institutions own shares only because millions of us give them money to
buy them.
And it surfaced again yesterday with the news that Bank of Scotland is
seeking to restrict the rights of individual proprietors, as its
shareholders are still known, to put resolutions to the bank's future
agms, a move uncomfortably coinciding with a proposal from one small BoS
shareholder to limit directors' pay and benefits on the Mound.
Why this recurrent angst? I suppose I am at a loss to understand how
normally intelligent men (and a few women) in boardrooms and financial
institutions up and down the land can react, like my friend, with such
naive complacency to the current controversy. We are being presented
with a whole nest of complex questions here.
What constitutes appropriate levels of reward for senior corporate
executives? What relationship, if any, should these rewards have to the
rewards accorded to other staff? What should the role of the owners of
companies, the shareholders, be in approving these reward structures for
their most senior managers? And should the institutions, who wield the
block votes they do only because they sell insurance policies, unit
trusts, or pension products to the rest of us, or manage them on our
behalf, be able to cast these votes without a moment's regard for the
views and wishes of those same investors?
In his latest book, Company Man, Anthony Sampson tells of Sir Owen
Green of BTR asking one of his American directors why he was demanding
such a high salary. ''It's the score'' came the reply. Green saw that as
proof that ''America is still the kind of frontier society which
respects the richest man in town.''
These same assumptions have now spread to corporate Britain. After the
pounding he's had in the media, after the trauma of last Wednesday's
agm, Cedric Brown of British Gas was still defending his package on the
grounds that, while British Gas is the seventh biggest company in the
Footsie, there are 40 or 50 chief executives ahead of him in the
personal reward stakes. ''It's not even the score,'' sums up Brown's
defence.
Boardroom remuneration committees and their armies of consultants
operate on that same basis. The score. League tables of who's getting
what at the top. But, if everyone is bidding that score up, what
possible relationship can it have to the underlying performance of this
or that business? And doesn't that score carry uncomfortable echoes of
the going rate much loved of union negotiators in the seventies and
early eighties?
Since the recession, many boards have restored profit levels in the
companies they serve as much by hacking into the cost base and the
headcount as by growing the business.
In this age of anxiety, those who escape the axe are expected to work
even harder, cope with mounting levels of stress, but accept rewards
which, at best, keep pace with inflation. Call it envy if you like, but,
in that context, the sight of a few people at the top awarding each
other annual pay rises and other perks which, in some cases, swallow the
average annual wage in its entirety two or three times over, is not a
pretty one.
On the narrow issue of executive pay, it now looks as if the
much-vaunted Greenbury Committee has laboured long and hard to produce a
mouse. But, since the British Gas agm, the issues involved have widened
dramatically. Apart from some important but relatively rare exceptions,
the major institutional -- but proxy -- owners of companies in this
country have largely failed to call corporate boards to account. Most
agms are still stage managed in ways which could have taught the old
Soviet grey heads a thing or two.
Last Wednesday something stirred. The unaccountable casting of
millions of share votes by anonymous fund managers for a board against
the clear mood of thousands of small shareholders in the hall is no more
acceptable at a British Gas agm than it was at the TUC or other union
conferences. Labour may find it difficult to put workable proposals on
real shareholder democracy in place. But, for the moment, if I'm sensing
the public mood accurately, the ball is firmly at their feet.

Out of work managers are battling back into the firing line, reports
Geraldine Abrahams.
WHEN jobs are hard to come by at any age, it is hardly surprising that
when people over 40 are ''displaced'', they feel they may have missed
the boat.
The Government booklet Getting On, and information pack TOO OLD . . .
who says? aim to highlight the benefits of employing an older workforce,
in terms of experience, skills, commitment and reliability. Nevertheless
they recognise that the majority of employers still discriminate against
the over-40s.
With over a quarter-of-a-million skilled men and women over 40
unemployed in Britain at present, and with statistics and surveys
proving that around six out of 10 employers are less likely to employ
people over 35, there is a realisation that something has to be done to
counteract the damage of ageist attitudes in the workplace. Hugh Cushion
has taken up the challenge.
Cushion worked as a marketing consultant until two years ago, when his
business folded. At 52, he found himself without a job and with little
prospect of ever getting one which would exercise his skills.
He was forced to settle for work as an assistant in a DIY superstore,
earning #4.19 per hour and working overtime at weekends to make enough
to keep his family. When he looked at the waste of his own skills, and
thought about the number of other people in the same situation, he
decided it was time for action.
From his home base in Surrey, Cushion has set up the Forties Plus
Initiative, an agency designed to link unemployed middle managers with a
database of employers, particularly small businesses, from a variety of
industries.
Its slogan is: Let's put experience back to work. His target is to put
40,000 older unemployed workers back into small and medium-sized
businesses, through networking with people all over the country.
Hugh Cushion highlights employment policy of the major food retailers.
''Whilst Tesco recruitment and training policy is to be applauded, rival
Safeway are now hacking further supervisory and management grades, for a
second time,'' he says. ''Even their junior staff see no career
progression.
''We all know a dumped George or Mary down the street. Stress will
escalate through frustration by those unable to return to real work, and
via presenteeism for those left to hold the fort. Help us to help those
who have no representation and have been ignored by their professional
and trade associations.
''Our approach is to seek to bridge the age, gender, race and
religious divides and unite the nation's skills, regardless of
disability. True and democratic equal opportunities for all.''
All the political parties have endorsed the initiative, but Forties
Plus does not receive any grant aid or funding from any source. Apart
from modest membership fees, there is no money, and Hugh Cushion has had
to cash in his pension plan over the past six months, and take on three
lodgers.
He has mounted an extensive lobbying campaign to harness the support
of other back-to-work groups, and last month his brainchild, the
National Organisation of Unemployed Skills (NOUS) was launched on the
Internet.
Another trip to the information superhighways can be made through
Enterprise Highway 2000, which was launched earlier this month. It is a
self-help distance learning pack of over 180 pages of tutorial guide as
well as three discs of software, all designed to increase and maximise
job opportunities. The cost is #99.50 inc p&amp;p.
The Forties Plus IT/Internet launch of Enterprise Highway 2000 took
place at the Brookland Museum last month, against the backdrop of a
Hawker Hurricane fighter plane, a symbol of the Forties spirit of a
nation united, on what was coincidentally called VE Day -- Value
Experience Day.

<HEADLINE>Big Blue plans battle with Microsoft IBM launches a $3300m bid for Lotus</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978026657</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
New York, Monday -- IBM shocked Wall Street today by making a stunning
$3300m cash bid for Lotus Development in what would be the computer
giant's first hostile takeover of another company.
Only weeks after anti-trust concerns doomed the marriage of two other
computer industry giants, IBM, the world's biggest computer maker, said
it was willing to pay $60 a share for Lotus -- an 85% premium over
Lotus' $32.50 closing price on Friday.
The deal, if it goes through, would significantly alter the landscape
in one of the most intensely competitive businesses of 1990s, giving IBM
a powerful array of products to do battle with Microsoft, the personal
computer software leader.
The announcement sent Lotus shares soaring $28.50 to $61 on the Nasdaq
market in extremely heavy trading of more than 28 million shares. There
was immediate speculation that the bidding could go higher.
''We think we have offered a very good and fair price for Lotus,'' IBM
chairman Louis Gerstner said at a news conference in New York. He said
the proposed merger was in the ''absolute interest of both companies'
shareholders.''
The shock offer, which was believed to be IBM's first hostile offer
for another firm, came only three weeks after Microsoft abandoned its
$2000m bid for Intuit because of Justice Deparment opposition on
anti-trust grounds.
IBM officials in the UK said it was too early to say what impact the
bid might have on IBM's huge factory in Greenock, which employs 3000
people and makes personal computers for sale in Europe, the Middle East
and Africa.
But on the face of it there should be no conflict of interest between
Lotus, which develops computer software, and the Greenock factory, which
makes computers on which software is run.
Last January IBM's chief executive in the UK, Javaid Aziz, stressed
that Greenock had been selected as of the multi-national's core
manufacturing plants and gave public assurances that no cutbacks were
being considered.
In 1994 IBM's UK division made a profit of #176m on sales of #4400m,
coming out of the red for the first time since 1990.
Nearly half of last year's sales were exports from the Greenock
factory, which manufactures computers from scratch and undertakes some
research and development. IBM had been gearing up to announce the
transfer of new functions to the plant shortly.
The US-based company employs about 9000 people in the UK, having
whittled down its workforce from a peak of 25,000 in 1986.
Mr Gerstner, who took over as chairman of a troubled IBM -- known as
Big Blue -- only two years ago, said he did not anticipate any antitrust
issues to hold up the deal, which IBM said could takes months to
complete.
''We have very, very few overlaps with our products,'' Mr Gerstner
said.
Lotus, creator of the widely used Lotus Notes software for connecting
computers and the 1-2-3 spreadsheet programme for financial
applications, issued a brief statement calling the IBM bid
''particularly surprising'' in light of joint development negotiations
that had been going on between the two companies recently.
Lotus said its mangement would consult legal and financial advisers
and ''then take any and all appropriate action to preserve and promote
the vital best interests of this company.''
IBM, acknowledging that Lotus had spurned its earlier overtures, said
it would launch its tender offer tomorrow
''Because you have been unwilling to proceed with such a transaction,
we are announcing this morning our intention to buy all of Lotus
Development Corporation's outstanding common shares for a price of $60
per share, or $3.3 billion,'' Mr Gerstner said in a letter to Jim Manzi,
chairman, president and chief executive of Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based Lotus.
Analysts said IBM wants to buy Lotus to expand the market for its OS/2
Warp operating system for personal computers, as well as gain a hugely
successful applications product, Lotus Notes.
Currently IBM's OS/2 software is installed in about nine million
computers, which is dwarfed by the 60 million machines using Microsoft's
rival Windows software.
''Combining IBM and Lotus represents a truly unique opportunity,'' Mr
Gerstner said in a statement announcing the offer. ''Our goal is to
accelerate the creation of a truly open . . . collaborative computing
environment so people can work and communicate across enterprises and
across corporate and national borders.''
Mr Gerstner said IBM had been in talks with Lotus for about five
months about a transaction and that he hoped IBM woould be able to
conclude the deal with a negotiated transaction, instead of a hostile
takeover.
''All of the steps we've taken today were aimed at getting a
negotiated settlement and we hope we will have a negotiated settlement
as soon as possible,''

SIR Richard Scott has been turning over stones in central government's
garden with great diligence since the beginning of his inquiry into the
supply of arms to Iraq. Inevitably, some rather dubious specimens of
both personal behaviour and practice have been found sticking to the
bottom of the stones. Just as inevitably, there have been howls of
indignation at the whole process, partly from those who are likely to be
criticised in the final report and partly from those, like Lord Howe,
who see themselves as defenders of the system but who should know
better. If matters had rested there all would be well. There appears no
doubt that the Scott inquiry will result in the most thorough
examination of the machinery of central government ever seen in this
country. Ministers, civil servants, and the conduct of government
business are likely to be criticised in damning terms and it is clear
that the Prime Minister will rue the day (probably in September) when
the report is made public.
That said, it would be only sensible for those concerned to prepare a
defence against Scott's conclusions. Less sensible, indeed inexcusable,
is the hint that some have tried to delay the publication of the report
by late submission of material (something which has infuriated Scott and
which he is preparing to criticise publicly) and by requests for more
time to respond to criticism. Taken together with the frequent hints
that a rumour campaign has been mounted against the Scott inquiry on
behalf of certain figures, it seems possible that interference has taken
place. Mr Robin Cook thinks so, though this should not surprise us. He
discerns a whispering campaign aimed at destroying the credibility of
the inquiry and accuses Mr Major of failing to support the inquiry which
he established. Mr Cook's strictures about the whispering campaign are
fair, although his criticism of the Prime Minister is not, specifically
because he asked a leading question about Mr Major's confidence in Sir
Richard Scott, then attacked him for not reaffirming it. Frankly, it is
not Mr Major's job to issue statements of this sort; he had sufficient
confidence in Sir Richard to appoint him in the first place and further
comment should be superfluous.
The odd thing about the seemingly deliberate delays which have
bedevilled Scott is that it is difficult to see who they would benefit.
Holding back the issue of the final report until the time of the summer
parliamentary recess might seem obvious, but anyone who imagines that
the results of Scott will be downplayed simply because the baying hordes
in Westminster are not present is sadly deluded. A brief reminder of the
cast of possible culprits serves to remind us of the extreme seriousness
of this affair. Whatever Mr Waldegrave and senior civil servants said,
the guidelines on exports to Iraq were changed without Parliament being
informed. The use of Public Interest Immunity Certificates to withold
evidence from a trial on grounds of national security has also been
comprehensively demolished, at least as carried out by Messrs Clarke,
Rifkind, Lilley, and Heseltine. Kenneth Clarke, in what seems
retrospectively the first of his major errors, offered to resign if
criticised by the inquiry. Mr Heseltine was cannier, although anyone
connected with these certificates should brace themselves. Overshadowing
that issue like a legal albatross is the figure of the attorney-general,
Sir Nicholas Lyell, who told Ministers they had no option but to sign.
Much pain lies ahead for the Government and no amount of delay will
soften it.

THIS month the jokes will be in Paisley instead of on it. Usually, the
old place is the butt of whimsy from all quarters. More merriment gets
made up against it than anywhere else, even Aberdeen, which asks to be
laughed at. It will be a big change for the Buddies to be egged on to
fashion their own fancies.
The funny thing that's happening to them on their way through June is
called Do YOU Think You're Funny?
A part of Paisley Festival, a fortnight of song and dance and street
parades, is to be curtained off for a comedy competition. Three pub
nights will be palaces of varieties for local drolls. The prize for the
big winner will be the chance to go on later at the town hall, no less.
It sounds a bagatelle. To audiences in other parts of the world it is
needed only to say the word Paisley and they fall about with mirth. As a
creative tool in the hands of comics, the town's name ranks with
mothers-in-law or knickers; sometimes it is as effective as both
together.
Inside Paisley the story could be much the same. Would-be funsters
will be given an easy time because everybody there is ready for a laugh.
Especially this year, it needs a funny bone just to survive.
It may always have been so. Folk who used their river for a sewer
while they continued to call it the White Cart, are not just humourists
but philosophers. They had the further quaint river custom of launching
boats into it sidey-ways.
Although myriad jests adhere to the place, they have almost always
been the same jest. It has to do with the town's good sense of thrift.
An easily amused outside world choses to call it meanness.
Hence the crack that when Paisley people flit to another house they
take the wallpaper with them. When the town's pigeons go down the coast
for a day's outing they carry their own bread to save on cafe prices.
And there is always a wag with a little historical learning who likes
to point out that a Paisley shawl, like a shroud, has no pockets in it.
Even geography offers no hiding place. It has been averred that the
Grand Canyon, Colorado, USA, was excavated by a Buddy on his Fair
holiday who was looking for a penny he dropped.
Although dire enough, none of these drolleries will be a lift to the
contestants in the Do YOU Think You're Funny? show. At best they might
be a help to a hard landing on the pavement of Wellmeadow Street outside
their pub.
More encouraging for the funsters to know is that they will be
treading boards polished by two local geniuses. For a place notorious
for its clowns, it has had two stand-up comedians capable of standing
out in any company.
Of more distant memory was Willie McCulloch (l883-l960), so dab an
entertainer he could make Greenock audiences see the joke. He did
monologues called the likes of the Clachanstoorie Literary Society and
the Baun' Practice, if there will be the likes of them again.
Willie McCulloch would have walked a comedy competition. When a London
fancier accepted a wager that no Scotchman could entertain the Chelsea
Arts Club for the length of a football match without one member leaving
for the bar, it was the Paisley entertainer who won the bet for him.
And then there was Hector Nicol.
Comic king of clubland, rapper of gags at l0 a minute, strummer of
blue notes -- ''sophisticated earthiness'' was how he described his
bawdy style -- Hector Nicol was a Buddy who chose to bide in Edinburgh,
a double burden that only a great sense of fun could bear.
He liked to tell the tale of a local player who scored in every round
of the Scottish Cup and shot the winner in the final against Rangers.
(It's just a joke.)
But for the rest of his life the lad was convinced he had been
offside. At the pearly gates he told the man at the door he had no right
to come in because the goal should not have counted.
The saintly janitor said that was nonsense. ''We all watched the game
up here,'' he explained. ''It was a perfectly good goal. Come away in.''
Finding another Buddy in heaven took the player a long time. When at
last he bumped into townsman, he confessed what a relief it had been to
get rid of a lifetime of guilt. ''St Peter was so kind about it,'' he
said.
''St Peter wasn't on that day,'' he was told. ''That was St Mirren.''
It was also Hector Nicol's pleasure to get away with the crack that
George Best should have signed for St Mirren on the grounds that nobody
in Paisley ever bought anybody a drink.
The festival programme stays mute about how bountiful the big prize
will be for the champion comic. On this 10th anniversary year of Hector
Nicol's death, it would be neat to name a trophy after him. An elegant
crystal chanty would be the very goblet to reflect his style.
The Hector Nicol Prize has a ring to it, lacking in the award named
after a brand of fizzy water that goes to the fastest gag in the East at
the Edinburgh Festival. Besides, Paisley Festival comes first from June
l6.

IN reply to W Raymond Shaw's letter (May 30) about the need for ''an
imaginative plan'' to boost Scottish tourism I would have expected him,
with a firm background in the tourism industry to be more aware of the
current efforts to sell Scottish tourism at home and abroad.
Of course major screen presentations such as Rob Roy should not solely
be relied upon to market our great country, even if that film has
already attracted 200 journalists to the Highlands in 1995. This is why
over the last 12 months the Scottish Tourist Board have initiated an
exhaustive list of campaigns, namely:
A new #2 million TV campaign in England highlighting a new
contemporary image for Scotland.
A series of seven activity brochures highlighting an array of outdoor
all-weather activity holidays.
A new campaign to market Scotland's outer islands.
New advertising campaigns in primary markets in the USA, Germany, and
France.
Strong synergy with area tourism marketing strategies.
We have not left our imagination behind at the cinema door and these
new campaigns respresent the framework for a resurgence in the industry
which is already beginning to emerge. However, it would be negligent of
a public agency responsible for tourism not to capitalise on the
opportunities that these films represent. They are the conduit through
which our new message to consumers may be conveyed.
As to comparisons with other nations, namely Ireland, the resources
they have at their disposal are significantly greater than our own,
which of course is why we are trying to boost our own funds by working
with commercial partners such as the movie industry.

I READ with some amusement and more than a little irritation, H
Mitchell's attack on Union Flag waving by the Scottish Conservatives at
the Perth and Kinross by-election (May 30). This was an incredible
display of double standards.
One could retort that the word ''nationalist'' is an anathema to the
SNP -- but only when wrapped in the Union Flag. What were SNP supporters
doing other than hijacking the Saltire and Lion Rampant when they were
dancing around with these flags on Ms Cunningham's attainment of a
majority?
As for the Union Flag standing for Imperialism, one could argue that
half the flags of Europe and beyond have stood for that aim at one time
or another. The fact that Britain was more ''successful'' than most is
another point entirely.
And what of Scotland's whiter-than-white image? Weren't the Jacobites,
of whom Scottish Nationalists are so fond, trying to impose their leader
on the English when it was obvious that the Stuarts had completely burnt
their boats in terms of suitability?
It is too often forgotten that the '45 was not an attempted liberation
of Scotland but a failed grasp for the British throne that resulted in
an English backlash that all but destroyed Highland culture.
If it's all right to be a ''Civic Nationalist'' for the SNP, what's
wrong with being the same on a British level which many Tories in
Scotland and England are?
The term ''British Nationalist'' has simply been hijacked by the
neo-nazis, who have the least right to it when they stand alongside the
principles of the war-time enemy.
It is politically expedient for the SNP to connect the whole Tory
Party with that image when it is they who are a Nationalist party with
Socialist tendencies.
It is disgraceful to lump the SNP with the extreme right and issues of
the war, but it is they who promote separatism, it is they who take in a
membership intolerant of the English, and it is they who greedily want
all the oil in the North Sea for Scotland when the effort and funding of
exploration and recovery was wholly a British and international one.
It is a lust for power and money that drives the SNP, nothing more.
I have no problem being Scottish and British; some people have and
that is their democratic right in a democratic Britain. What worries me
is that it is more and more politically incorrect in Scotland to call
yourself British if you wish without fear of recrimination. That is
intolerance in action.

YOUR article regarding the archaeological dig on the Isle of May for
the grave of St Adrian (June 2) reminded me of a strange encounter with
an odd character on the foreshore between Crail and Anstruther in 1952.
Returning from a visit to the Caiplie caves, with their association
with early Christians (and later smugglers), I was met by an enormous
farmworker who, chatting about local history, jerked his head in the
direction of the May and with peculiar conviction in his voice said:
''It's a good place that -- there's no evil on that island.''
He went on to recall a shipwreck there in the late thirties -- it
could be seen clearly from Crail, piled up on the north end of the
island. He had been in charge of blowing up the wreck to salvage the
metal and had laid the charges after making sure that no visitors were
anywhere near the wreck.
Having got the ''all clear'', he pushed the plunger to set the charges
off but nothing happened. After his third attempt, he looked up and to
his horror spotted a child of one of the visitors on top of the wreck.
The child was removed, the charges all checked and found to be in
order, and at the first attempt, the wreck was blown up.
The look on his face as he told the story left no doubt that it had
been a traumatic experience and, whatever the scientific explanation may
be, my friend was convinced of his own -- ''there's something good on
that isle''.

FRED B CASELY (June 2) clearly indulges in golden-age reminiscence of
a reasonably successful form of beat policing that regrettably has been
consigned to the pages of social history.
Mr Casely's force which, as he puts it, maintained the trust and
co-operation of the public, was predominantly male, physically
impressive, its members conditioned by long years on one relatively
small beat.
Importantly, its supervising staff, as with its departmental staff,
formed a mere minority of its operational strength deployed upon the
public streets. Merit lay in the crime-free beat.
Policing today is clearly something quite different, relying heavily,
in the absence of a visible beat presence, upon the overworked media
exercise of well-publicised ''crackdowns''. Hence we are now firmly
ensconced within an era of gimmick policing exemplified by Operation
Blade and its sequels.
In all honesty, what lasting benefit to society is gained in the
vacuous hype projected by a chief police officer disporting himself
among an assorted collection of domestic hardware? The sober mind
recalls the Emperor's new clothes, for such an exercise is so derisive
as to suggest an Oscar rather than a knighthood which Mr Casely would
suggest.
For people do not feel safe upon our public streets today and often
less so within their homes. This is clearly expressed in the rise of the
vigilante, the private security firm and proposals for auxiliary police
forces.
Use of the knife and the bullet find reportage within these pages with
disquieting regularity; drugs are openly peddled on the public streets;
Buckfast-swilling mobs of adolescents freely roam residential areas
without ''hassle'', their word not mine.
Mr Casely must know that Percy Sillitoe earned his knighthood by
establishing an efficient system of beat policing which successfully met
the challenge of rising crime and violence in the inter-war years. He
did not court popularity either within or outwith his force, but he
certainly gave meaning to the cardinal responsibilities of a police
force as enumerated by Mr Casely in textbook fashion.
Fault does not lie at the door of central and local government since
all parties are united in their concern to tackle rising crime. It does,
however, lie squarely with the inward-looking stance of the police
themselves.
In very large measure Sir Patrick Sheehy provided an answer to today's
policing malaise had the findings of his report been accepted in full by
police representative bodies.
That the report has been adulterated underlines that today's police
leadership is of insufficient stature to grasp the nettle with the
result that a magnificent opportunity to redress the balance in favour
of law and order has been lost.
Only the sycophant would suggest otherwise.

WHATEVER the outcome of the current battle to prevent the immediate
withdrawal of the sleeper service to Fort William, if the future of the
West Highland railway line itself is to be secured it must be properly
marketed and promoted now to attract users, particularly tourists.
It offers one of the greatest railway journeys in the world and
provides a magnificent opportunity for visitors to Scotland to see some
of the splendour of the West Highlands.
Regrettably, neither ScotRail nor the tourist boards seem prepared to
promote it in the way it deserves, and since its centenary last year the
situation appears to have markedly deteriorated.
In recent years ScotRail has produced an attractive guide and
timetable for the line with a colour picture on the front. The new
timetable for this summer is of the standard ScotRail format; gone are
the colour illustrations and even the name ''West Highland'' on the
front cover.
Not only is the size of the guide reduced, but so is the number of
services with the withdrawal of the Explorer trains. The availability of
reasonably priced, flexible West Highland Rover tickets (which ScotRail
confirms are still available) does not even get a mention.
The tourist boards appear to give virtually no publicity to this line
despite its potential for boosting Scotland's tourist industry. A
strategic plan has recently been produced for Scottish tourism, but the
attention given to transport, and to railways in particular, is pitiful.
In the draft for this plan, circulated as a consultative document in
July 1994, worries were expressed about the future of the railway
network but it was stated: ''The Government, however, has given a
commitment that its plans for railway restructuring will have no adverse
impact of the railway network.''
This statement was dropped from the final version of the plan. An
inquiry to the Scottish Tourist Board as to why it had been omitted
produced a response from the director of planning and development which
stated: ''I am very intrigued at the difference you point out . . . Many
drafting changes were made in the evolution of the final version and I
cannot now remember how the final version of the section on transport
emerged. Certainly I cannot remember any major policy changes being
discussed . . . ''
Instead of defending and promoting railway lines such as the West
Highland and holding the Government to whatever commitment it gave, is
the tourist board colluding with ScotRail in allowing such rail services
to wither away?

IT HAS been suggested by John Shearer, on behalf of the Lanarkshire
Nursing Homes Association, that there are residential establishments run
by Strathclyde Regional Council which ''have not had an inspection in
over three years'' (June 1). Mr Shearer has already raised this issue
with us and was told that his source of information was inaccurate.
In fact, all residential homes in all sectors in Strathclyde are
subject to regular inspections and all but two of the local authority,
private and voluntary homes for elderly people have been inspected at
least once since May of last year.
Inspections are rigorous and detailed, dealing with all aspects of a
home's care. They happen on both a planned and unannounced basis and
often result in detailed recommendations about homes in all sectors.
At this stage summary reports of inspection visits are publicly
available on all homes for adults and elderly people inspected within
the last 12 months.
The Government requires councils to establish an advisory committee to
monitor and review the work of inspection units. The Strathclyde
advisory committee is currently chaired by a private-home owner who is a
member of the Scottish Association of Care Home Owners.
The advisory committee does have some concerns about the fact that
local authority homes are not bound by statutory registration
requirements.
However, the advisory committee has always been completely satisfied
that the inspection unit works in an even-handed manner between sectors
both in relation to standards and to regularity of visits to local
authority, private and voluntary homes.

Eric Kennedy focuses in on a young man who reckons Stornoway's smiles
better
WHEN the tax man comes at you for a year's payment it is worse than
having a tooth out. So says George MacLeod, and you might think he could
have used a less worrying simile. He is, after all, a dentist.
George's discovery that tax men have teeth came while he was working
at a Stornoway practice. ''You are self-employed,'' he says. ''That
means you have to put a section of your earnings aside for tax.
''But when you have to stump up, it comes as a shock.''
This, and the fact that being self-employed can have too many ups and
downs, persuaded him to apply for a salaried position. These days George
is to be seen travelling around Lewis with a mobile surgery in his role
as community dentist.
It involves going to schools, although he also attends to the elderly,
the housebound, and nursing mothers.
He likes the variety and regular salary. Also, Lewis is a fine place
in which to live even though you cannot get on or off the island on a
Sunday. ''If you want away for a weekend you have to negotiate the
Monday off,'' he says.
George was born in Glasgow, and grew up there but his parents come
from the Hebrides, and he supposes the lure was always there.
Educated at St Mirin's Academy in Paisley, he gained six Highers in
1983. He felt dentistry was an interesting career, so he applied to
Glasgow University to join the course.
The first two years were spent in class learning anatomy, chemistry,
biology, physiology, and pharmacology. Then he went on to the School of
Dentistry and Dental Hygiene in Sauchiehall Street, starting with
general medicine and attending clinics and lectures at the Royal
Infirmary in general medicine and pathology. He also did ward rounds.
So far the course was similar to that of a student doctors. Then he
studied dental anatomy, dental materials and science, spending ''hours
and hours'' in the lab learning how to make dentures and crowns.
He finally got near his first patient at the end of his third year,
working at dentistry school clinics and dealing with emergency
extractions. His fourth and fifth years were arduous, learning the
various disciplines -- orthodontics, paedodontics (children),
prosthodontics (dentures), periodontology (gum disease), conservation
(fillings and crowns), and oral surgery (extractions, etc).
But life was hard, with three lectures each morning, clinics from 2pm
to 5pm, and studying at night.
Eventually, on graduating BDS in 1988, he had the choice of going for
vocational training (which has since become compulsory) or going
straight into practice.
He chose the latter, but today's students find the year's vocational
training -- salaried work with a general practice -- an ideal
introduction to the profession.
He found himself answering an advertisement for the Stornoway job,
where he stayed for four years before going into community dentistry.
George MacLeod has no regrets about his choice of career: ''It is a
worthwhile job and I like where I work,'' he says. ''I have no immediate
plans to make any changes.''

I was surprised to find ''Lake Nyasa'' given as the answer for the
so-called Calendar Lake in Weekender Prize Quiz (June 3). Surely this
should have been given as Lake Malawi, as it is known today.
Indeed, as it was always known to the Africans. It was David
Livingstone who, on reaching the lake in September 1859, asked what it
was called and was told ''Nyasa, bwana'' -- It's a lake, sir --
resulting in his putting ''Lake Lake''on the map.

Elmore Leonard writes crime thrillers; Hollywood director Quentin
Tarantino wants to film them. Fasten your seat belts for more pulp
fiction, writes Douglas Thompson
ELMORE LEONARD is the Dickens from Detroit who writes what he calls
''crime thrillers'' involving strangely principled hoodlums, whores, con
men, and hustlers who all want to score big bucks and points without
resorting to tiring car chases and Murder One. His wonderful underworld
is a Grand National of zanies and whackos chasing a winner but usually
finding there are too many hurdles.
Quentin Tarantino is the young Hollywood writer/director of the
moment. After making the viciously violent Reservoir Dogs in 1992 and
last year's Pulp Fiction the former video store clerk who wrote True
Romance and the original script for Natural Born Killers is already a
movie myth, a subject of adulation, three unofficial biographies this
year, and continuing controversy. Reservoir Dogs is still -- officially
-- not available on video in Britain. Tarantino now wants the film
options on all Leonard's available offbeat novels. Killshot will be his
first movie from the work on the author with an ear for real-life
dialogue and a penchant for black and stag humour. (''When the girls
would say do-it-to-me, do-it-to-me, he would think: 'What do you think
I'm doing?''')
The newcomer Tarantino, 32, who created John Travolta's smacked-out
punk killer Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction and the veteran Leonard, 64,
who described hit man Eddie Moke in his novel Stick as ''looking like he
mainlined cement'' are an artistic team in what is, for most, an askew
and forbidden world.
It's a killer combination.
Both men work in shades of society mixed on a palette of behaviour
that involves both the absurd and the abominable. And the sociopathic
are the most colourful of all.
Tarantino won a screenplay Oscar this year for Pulp Fiction. Leonard's
Pronto is selling brilliantly world-wide (in paperback in Britain,
Penguin, Sterling #4.99) and a couple of the characters from it appear
again in his latest, Riding The Rap, which has just received an
enthusiastic reception in America.
Filming of Leonard's comic thriller Get Shorty was completed this
spring. It involves a Miami hit man who flies to Tinseltown to collect a
debt and then decides he likes Hollywood and wants to make his life into
a movie.
Travolta was paid $5m dollars for his lead role and frankly admits
that until his extraordinary reviews for Pulp Fiction he thought he was
finished as a movie star. ''I wasn't getting any calls. I was thinking
'Maybe, it's over -- 20 years was a pretty good run.''' Sitting in a
Beverly Hills hotel suite he says: ''I was pleased with it, honestly, I
was happy to go with it until this something special happened.''
But that ''something special'' involved playing a heroin-taking
killer. Did that bother him? ''It's the biggest change I've ever had on
screen but at that point in my career it was a risk I had to take. I
trusted the actors, the director, and the material.'' A Scientologist
since 1975 he credits the cult -- Tom Cruise is another member -- with
helping him through his difficult patches but has, he says, no
difficulties with his personal beliefs and the violence in the movie
which resurrected his career.
Tarantino brought Travolta back as an actor. The Look Who's Talking
movies had helped his bank balance but simply reincarnated his celebrity
from the stellar days of Grease, Saturday Night Fever and the late 1970s
when he, in every way, was the disco king of the movies, a world-wide
star.
Get Shorty, which does not involve Tarantino, was produced by Danny
Devito's Jersey Films and the actor-director plays a greedy producer.
The movie puts Travolta back with the major league players like Gene
Hackman, another class co-star in Get Shorty.
Quentin Tarantino -- he was named after Burt Reynolds's blacksmith
Quint on Gunsmoke -- had a meeting with Travolta while he was writing
Pulp Fiction. Hollywood's latest Wunderkind said: ''I didn't exactly
write it quite for how John played it. I wrote something a little bit
more to the right, but when I met John I thought that would be a really
different way to go -- but WHAT a way. Then I just got really excited
about the possibilities.''
The high school dropout (at 14) and a self-taught film-maker who went
to jail three times because he could not afford to pay traffic tickets
is convinced. Now he never stops working. His first thespian outing was
as an Elvis impersonator on The Golden Girls but now he's acting in Mr
Destiny Turns on the Radio with Nancy Travis and Dylan McDermott, D from
Dusk to Dawn with George 'E R' Clooney, and in the romance Hands Up.
Although he plans to direct Leonard's Killshot -- for once in Leonard
fiction a female takes command of the action -- later this year he
maintains: ''I'm just too lazy to make movie after movie. I will live a
normal life.''
Fat chance.
He worked for the script for the nuclear submarine movie Crimson Tide
and also as a ''scripted doctor'' on some television series. There's
also talk of a big-screen Man From U.N.C.L.E. film (Tarantino is a major
fan).
Although he still lives in a modest West Hollywood apartment he admits
to having developed a taste for the good life -- things like $300 caviar
and Cristal champagne ''snacks''. He laughs: ''Caviar was one of those
things where I didn't want to try it and then I had some and 'ooh la
la'. I never understood the allure of champagne and then I had some
Cristal in Paris. I got the message.''
By contrast, Elmore Leonard is a nine to five man. Generally each day
he sits at his 200-year-old desk writing in longhand (he revises on a
reconditioned portable typewriter) without a break for lunch at the home
he shares with his second wife Joan. It is 15 miles outside Detroit but
many more away from the streets his characters prowl. He has created a
memorable rainbow of tough, evil, sad, sadistic and sometimes
sympathetic but best of all just plain psycho-crazy characters.
He looks like an absent-minded professor all the way up to his Kangol
cap. But, like his plots, his owlish appearance is deceiving. He
provides material for those who want to read fast, often absurdly funny,
occasionally violent, sometimes sexy page-turners. The critics put him
in hallowed sentences with Dashiel Hammet, Raymond Chandler, and Ross
McDonald and he does not complain about that company. It's just not
quite accurate. They wrote mysteries. He writes thrillers.
He talks softly through a wispy beard: ''I never read mysteries. I'm
interested in what antagonists are doing and thinking and how they go
about what they do. That's why I've always felt the most interesting
parts of a mystery story, the classic mystery, are off stage.
''We don't see the bad guys in action and they interest me more than
the good guys. That's why I'm doing what I'm doing. It does not conform
to the usual way of telling a crime story.''
Nevertheless, doing it his way has provided multi-million dollar
dividends. But he is not wallowing in his success. ''People tell me I
can afford a Mercedes but I don't want one. I have no desire to move to
Beverly Hills or New York. I don't want a sailboat or a Rolls or to live
in some exotic setting. The work is my satisfaction, my fun. I certainly
believe in working for money. I believe in that but that isn't the
end-all by any means. My satisfaction is not having written it but
actually doing it. As far as I can remember I have always been a
storyteller. I'm happy to sit at a desk and tell a story all day.
''I like the words of violence. I think people who are in the criminal
life are interesting. The bad guys interest me . . .''
As they do Quentin Tarantino.
It looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship, but fasten your
seat belts for much, much more pulp fiction.

ST NINIAN'S High School in Eastwood used to embrace democracy through
its system of pupil councils. However, with two members elected from
each class, there was no guarantee that they were representative of
pupil opinion. They might well be speaking for themselves.
Now all pupils can have their say. Twice a session, each year-group is
taken off its timetable to divide into teams of 10. Selecting their own
chairman and reporter, they debate issues defined by both the pupil body
and the staff. The reports from the groups are summarised by assistant
head teachers and presented to the senior management team, which
considers them before deciding which recommendations can be implemented.
The head teacher, James McVittie, then addresses the year-group
assembly and explains to them the senior management team's views of the
suggestions which have come forward. Some are beyond the school's
control.
The regulations on school capacity, for example, rule out action on
concerns expressed about overcrowding. On the other hand, the cafeteria
and its menu were restructured after pupil representations. The
arrangements for the election of head boy and girl were reshaped. A
whole-school review of health and sex education is being undertaken
because of comment from some pupils.
One topic on which staff specifically sought pupil opinion was
bullying. The encouraging response led to a series of one-hour seminars
being arranged, with the pupils again the main participants.
The whole exercise is conducted under the generic title of ''Values''.
St Ninian's sets out to promote values like tolerance and respect. ''As
a Catholic school,'' says James McVittie, ''we use the theme of Love God
love thy neighbour to drive our anti-racist strategy. We make pupils
aware of the Church's teaching on sexuality but respect their right to
make their own determination. One pupil said: 'You're just a mouthpiece
for the Church,' but we have to make our case.''
The values project also explores fundamental concepts like quality.
Pupil groups consider what makes a good teacher and a good school. Their
perceptions are very close to those of staff and parents. A good school
is one where pupils are motivated to succeed, and are respected as
individuals by staff. A good teacher is sympathetic, approachable, and
always ready and able to explain things.
Pupil thoughts on what constitutes a good school are equally
revealing. ''They want a teacher to keep firm control,'' said John
Fitzpatrick, the depute head. ''They want the class to be quiet and an
atmosphere of hard work to prevail.''
Assistant head John Docherty sees work-related issues like study
skills and homework as promising fruitful consultation with pupils.
''Also, on a wider front, we must get them to think about their own
contribution to the school,'' he said. ''What are the values that they
consider important?''
Teachers are assiduous in heeding the pupil views. According to Paul
Clark, in first year: ''We asked if they could give us more time, and
not push us too much. For instance, many of us hadn't done French in
primary. We can see the difference already in maths and languages, and
other subjects are considering it.''
Joseph Kane was impressed by staff willingness to listen. ''Somebody
suggested a creative writing club, and an English teacher has already
set it up. I never thought anything would happen.''
Second-year pupils were similarly convinced. Amelia Borland questioned
the need for seminars but her guidance teacher explained the rationale.
''Now I think it's a really good idea -- you can say what you want. And
you're not stopped from using computers at lunchtime. Teachers trust
you.''
The emphasis on trust was echoed by Robert Fleeting. ''I asked for
more talks on health education,'' he said. ''We got them. It gives you
confidence.''
For Marie O'Doherty: ''This is a good school. The teachers are great
at explaining things you don't understand. Guidance staff are helpful
with course choices.''
According to Julie Ballantyne: ''The best thing is getting a say. You
feel that teachers respect your views.'' David Farrell agreed. ''It's
good to talk,'' he said. ''You know the teachers are genuinely looking
for your opinion and are interested in it.''
The process has beneficial by-products. James McVittie says: ''It
helps pupils to think, analyse, chair, and report.'' He might have added
that it enhances self-confidence. His own rapport with the youngsters
meeting a journalist from outer space was such that, when he said:
''Tell him I'm the best head teacher in St Ninian's,'' their laughter
was natural. Others of their age might have wondered uneasily whether to
laugh dutifully or maintain an uncomfortable silence.

Kuala Lumpur, Monday
THIRTEEN Vietnamese boat people were hurt today when hundreds of
Malaysian police charged into a group of runaway refugees to try to
force them back into a camp.
The police also fired teargas at the group of about 600 as they tried
to herd them back into the camp on the outskirts of the capital Kuala
Lumpur.
''The police fired teargas when the Vietnamese started banging on the
walls of the camp after being herded in,'' said a witness.
''There was a lot of noise, drums from inside the camp, and women and
children screaming,'' he added.
''Twenty minutes after they fired the teargas, they fired jets of
water from water cannons on the top of their trucks into the camp.''
It was not known if any of the 13 casualties were seriously hurt.
Witnesses said several hundred riot police waded into the fleeing
refugees, swinging clubs at them. Some of the runaways were armed with
homemade knives, bows and arrows, and swords which were later
confiscated.
The police action ended with all the Vietnamese back inside the Sungei
Besi Transit camp.
Late today a police helicopter hovered over the camp while the
Vietnamese lined the balconies of camp buildings, looking down on 50 or
more police trucks milling outside.
The 600 boat people were the remainder of some 3000 Vietnamese who had
escaped from the camp after an early morning clash with riot troops.
They were protesting against the prospect of being deported and some
had threatened mass suicide if they were attacked by police.
The Malaysian Government has set a deadline of August 31 to close the
camp.
The Vietnamese have been holding demonstrations and hunger strikes
since January to protest against a plan by the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees to send boat people in camps throughout south-east Asia back to
Vietnam.--Reuter.

AN Irish Roman Catholic priest has been murdered in South Africa.
Father Eamonn O'Neill was found strangled after failing to turn up for
mass at his church in CapeTown. His body was found by one of his
congregation.
Dublin-born Father O'Neill, 57, had been bound and gagged, and was
thought to have been the victim of burglars. He had been in South Africa
for almost 30 years.

Malcolm McNaught reports on the blurring of the boundaries between
commercial sponsorships and the arts.
YOU'VE heard of the dangers of passive smoking. Let me introduce a new
evil: passive consumerism. Driving through town I have often suspected
that in the average minute the average motorist unconsciously takes in a
huge number of potentially lethal adverts for all sorts of products he
does not even want to buy. These leap out from billboards, from the
radio, but mostly in the form of company names displayed
indiscriminately to ensnare the unwary.
The other day I decided to attempt to remain conscious of what my
unconscious was being subjected to. The result of my completely
unscientific survey suggested that we receive about 20 to 30 such
subliminal messages a minute -- one every two seconds.
Fresh from this statistical triumph, I resolved to take my research
further afield. What effect did this passive inhalation of the waste
products of the advertising industry have upon the artistic life of our
nation, I mused? As luck would have it, I was going with a group of
third-year pupils to sample the cultural delights of
Stratford-upon-Avon, home of the Bard and, more recently, of the Royal
Shakespeare Company. An ideal place for some field work.
Like all newcomers to Stratford, each of our group was presented with
a visitor's pack; a compilation of some of the key documents required
during one's stay. This, of course, comes courtesy of a commercial
sponsor. And who more appropriate than Boots the Chemist, whose shop
frontage dominates the High Street and was almost certainly the very
place where Ann Hathaway would have collected her prescription leeches
or puchased her rhubarb and senna whenever Will and the kids were under
the weather?
The visitor's pack contained a map which was not to scale. In an
earlier, less commercialised age, distances in Stratford-upon-Avon
would, I imagine, be calculated according to their proximity to the
Gower Monument or some other cultural or achitectural landmark. For our
school group, however, all geographical considerations were reduced to
one simple equation: ''How far is that from McDonald's?''
The starting point for most tours of the town is The World of
Shakespeare centre on Waterside. Here our pupils were first introduced
to a startling example of the blurring of the boundaries between the
cultural and commercial so characteristic of Stratford.
Street frontage must be worth its dimensions in gold hamburgers so
close to the cultural heart of the town -- I speak, of course, of
McDonald's itself -- so another American fast food giant has solved the
problem by taking over half of the World of Shakespeare.
In fact, it has taken over more than half his world, because it has
sponsored a lavish audio-visual presentation of Shakespeare's life and
times. In just over 40 minutes one can enter imaginatively into life in
Elizabethan England, tour an exhibition of theatrical costumes and then
round the whole cultural experience off with one of Dunkin' Doughnuts.
But, as Hamlet rightly said, ''The play's the thing.'' Surely no
messing about would be permitted here . . .
Before visiting Stratford one of the pupils said that he imagined
Juliet as tall and blonde. His teacher, of course, quickly put him
right, pointing out that, being Mediterranean, Juliet would have a dark
complexion and black hair. To the staff's horror and his delight, Juliet
bounded onto the stage the living embodiment of his teenage fantasy. The
director was obviously playing to the ''blondes are sexier'' prejudices
of schoolboys of all ages in the audience.
Either that or her surprising choice of hair colour had something to
do with sponsorship from Stay Blonde hair-care products. At least she
didn't have the name emblazoned across her chest, football style -- the
very area of her anatomy at which she was later to score a spectacular
own-goal with Romeo's dagger. Blood stains and the sponsor's logo do not
go well together.
As with most theatre companies nowadays, each of the RSC's productions
is sponsored by a different company. So far the involvement has been
restricted to the name appearing prominently on programmes and posters,
but the day will undoubtedly come when the titles and the content of the
play themselves will reflect both the name of the sponsor and the nature
of his interest.
We will have The Tragedy of Big Mac-beth for example. In the Legal and
General production of Othello, it will be discovered in a specially
commissioned sixth act that the money from Desdemona's PEPS more than
made up for any sentimental inconvenience her strangulation may have
caused her family.
One of its rivals, Commercial Union, has allegedly turned down the
sponsorship of all tragedies since, as their advertising blurb clearly
states: ''We don't make a drama out of a crisis.''
What would Shakespeare have thought of this commercial exploitation of
his reputation and his art? Well, as someone who understood the
exigencies of raising money for his cultural undertakings through royal
patronage, he would almost certainly have been all for it. After all, as
the well-known blonde bombshell from Verona has observed: ''What's in a
name? A doughnut by any other name would taste as sweet.''

Umlazi, Tuesday
AT LEAST three people were killed today when some 2000 African
National Congress (ANC) supporters marched to protest against violence
in South Africa's Zulu heartland.
The latest deaths, in Umlazi township outside the Indian Ocean port
city of Durban, brought to at least 35 the number of people killed in
the volatile province since Friday.
The ANC supporters marched to the magistrate's courts to protest
against the violence. Police fired teargas and troops were moved in to
keep the ANC marchers and supporters of the rival Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP) apart.
''It looks like the three deaths are all linked to today's march,''
said Warrant Officer Vish Naidoo.
Police spokesman Major Robbie Cooke said shots had also been fired at
a mobile police base from an Inkatha stronghold in Umlazi.
He said police had used tear gas several times to keep rival groups
apart. They also removed barricades from roads in the township where
witnesses said several buses were stoned.
Shots continued to ring out during the day and police said they feared
overnight clashes.
Local ANC official George Sithole said the organisation wanted the
township to be declared an unrest area.
Five of the weekend killings, including those of a 12-month-old boy
and a three-year-old girl, took place on Saturday in revenge for an
attack in which three youths in the area were killed on Friday, said
police spokesman Captain Dawood Kader.
A 60-year-old woman was also killed in the revenge attack, the motive
for which appeared to be the political feud between the ANC and Inkatha,
said Kader.
Nearly 1600 people have been killed in political violence since April
last year when the ANC won the country's first all-race elections. Most
of the killings have taken place in Inkatha-ruled KwaZulu-Natal.
Meanwhile, a white former military intelligence officer has been
arrested in connection with 13 murders in the Zulu heartland in 1987.
Brigadier John More, who was a senior officer in the Directorate of
Special Tasks in Military Intelligence, has been arrested by an
Investigations Task Unit (ITU) probing political violence in
KwaZulu-Natal.
Police said More was on secondment to South Africa's arms procurement
agency, Armscor.
A white former security policeman, Colonel Louis Botha, was arrested
last week in connection with several KwaZulu-Natal murders in the late
1980s last week.--Reuter.

Johannesburg, Monday
SOUTH African President Nelson Mandela came under increasing pressure
today over the ''Shell House massacre'' with the country's police chief
saying he wanted to discuss his role in the killings.
His admission last week that he told guards they could kill if
necessary to protect ANC headquarters during protests in March 1994 has
battered Mandela's image as a miracle worker who can do no wrong,
political analysts say.
Police chief George Fivaz said he wanted the investigation into the
Shell House killings to be completed rapidly and impartially.
He called on politicians to cool their rhetoric or ''a real danger to
safety and security could emerge''.
Fivaz said he would obtain a statement from the president as part of
investigations into what has come to be known as the Shell House
massacre, when African National Congress guards killed eight Zulu
marchers in Johannesburg on March 28, 1994.
Mandela, 76, took responsibility in remarks to senators last Thursday
for the deaths on a day of bloodshed in which 60 people were killed in
and around Johannesburg.--Reuter.

IT had been billed as the student movement's equivalent of the clause
four debate. But at last week's National Union of Students special
conference in Derby, it was the traditionalists who prevailed.
By a 10% majority delegates, dominated by hard-left factions, defied
the union's modernising leadership, and refused to back a radical motion
calling for a move towards a loan-based system known as MICL
(Maintenance Income Contingent Loans) coupled with a contribution from
employers through corporation tax to finance student maintenance costs.
Students would repay the loans after graduation through income tax and
National Insurance contributions.
Instead, the conference, swept along by a tide of well-worn rhetoric,
passed a motion to resolving a ''campaign of free education as a right
for all and against any system which forces students to contribute to
their education''. NUS remains committed to a 16-year-old policy
demanding a restoration of student grants to 1979 levels and student
entitlement to state benefits -- a policy the union reckons would
require at least a 5p rise in income tax to pay for students currently
in post-16 education.
After the vote, the traditionalists claimed that they had struck a
blow, not just for student democracy, but for the principle of free
education. ''Today's vote proves that the student movement is committed
to free education and that students are prepared to defy their
leadership,'' claimed one euphoric delegate.
But the real effect of the Derby conference has been to isolate NUS,
not just from university managers and education policy makers but from
the students it represents. In Derby, NUS swung against the consensus
gradually emerging across higher education on a practical solution to
the seemingly intractable problem of funding students.
Last month a report by the Quality in Higher Education project based
at the University of Central England in Birmingham revealed that UCE
students were willing to pay up to 50% of their maintenance costs.
According to Funding Higher Education: Student Perspectives, the first
major study of student attitudes to funding, more than 90% wanted the
system reformed and only 40% thought that the Government should be
responsible for 100% of maintenance costs.
''It is evident that . . . a large percentage accept some form of
student or graduate contribution. It is the system of student
contribution, that is the Student Loans scheme, with which students
appear to be unhappy,'' the report concluded.
Professor Lee Harvey, the project's senior research fellow said:
''This research proves that there is no apparent confidence in the
current system among students. The debate now is not about whether
students make a contribution, but how.''
According to Douglas Trainer, NUS Scotland president, extreme
financial pressure has forced students to be realistic about funding
options. ''It's hardly surprising that students facing the levels of
hardship they do today are prepared to look at any option that replaces
the current failing system.''
Between 1982 and 1992, the number of undergraduates and postgraduates
increased by 65%. The number of students in further education has also
rocketed. And this has led to greater demands on teaching and library
space, and for new accommodation for students. But, according to the
Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals, since 1989 money provided
by the Government to universities for teaching each student has fallen
by 25%.
It is the consequences of the massive expansion that has forced
principals and politicians to think again about funding. ''Even
accepting that there are economics of scale, universities just can no
longer afford the cost of expansion unless they see a solution,'' said
Professor John Arbuthnott, Principal of Strathclyde University and
convener of the Committee of Scottish Higher Education Principals
(Coshep).
''On the student side things are getting very difficult,'' he said.
''The student loans system has worked badly and I don't think that
mechanism of funding students is regarded very highly. The grant has
been frozen and progressively cut. Costs are going up. It's becoming
more and more difficult to support maintenance costs. So how is this new
wave of students that we're going to see in three or four years going to
afford that?''
He too believes that a contributory system has become ''the
inescapable, logical conclusion'' to filling this funding gap. ''Both
political parties realise that some additional funding is necessary.
Labour are being cautious but they're not saying anything which would
indicate anything other than there will be an agenda of national
priorities and they may not be able to do everything from tax increases.
''At the same time you can see Tory ministers realise they're going to
have to show some sign of responding to pressures on tertiary education.
''
Even if a contributory system were introduced, major issues would
remain to be addressed, Prof Arbuthnott said. The biggest of these is
ensuring that the extra revenue is channelled back into higher
education, and that such a system does not become a barrier rather than
a gateway into university.
To overcome these difficulties, Coshep favours a system based on the
Australian model, where students are required to contribute around 20%
of the average total costs incurred by the Commonwealth Government. Like
MICL, the scheme is income-contingent with students repaying their
contributions only when their taxable incomes exceed average weekly
earnings.
''In Australia the government has made a commitment to ensure the
money is returned to higher education. I don't think you'd find many
people in higher education institutions supporting a sytem like this if
it wasn't guaranteed,'' Prof Arbuthnott said.
The rest of the higher education world is gradually facing up to the
reality that a contributory system of student funding is the only viable
method of delivering a properly funded post-16 education system. But the
National Union of Students may have missed its chance to lead the
shaping of this policy. As Jim Murphy, NUS president, told the
conference: ''When asked for solutions we can't rely on the failings of
a 16-year-old policy. When asked for our solutions we can't just say tax
the rich. And when asked for our solutions we can't support a policy
that costs 20 primary schools every day.''

Bonn, Monday
THREE decades ago Adolf Eichmann, one of Adolf Hitler's most notorious
henchmen, was hanged in Israel. Today his son Ricardo is only just
coming to terms with his father's part in the Nazi Holocaust.
''I think about it a lot more than ever before. In the past I tried to
avoid thinking about it,'' said Eichmann, 40, in a newspaper interview.
The mere thought of who his father was and what he did, was so
traumatic that Eichmann said he had no recollection of learning about
the Holocaust at his school in southern Germany.
''Either I played truant during those classes, or the teacher sent me
out of the class -- I don't know any more,'' said Eichmann, who recently
became a professor at Tuebingen University teaching early oriental
culture and civilisation.
His father fled Nazi Germany after the Second World War to Argentina
and lived there under an assumed name until the Israeli intelligence
service Mossad spirited him to Israel to stand trial in 1960.
Adolf Eichmann, nicknamed the ''technician of death'', was the SS
officer who masterminded ''the final solution'', the mass deportations
of six millions Jews from all over Europe to Nazi death camps during the
Third Reich.
Ricardo, born in 1955 in Argentina, barely remembers his father,
sentenced to be hanged by a Jerusalem court in 1961. He was five years
old when his father went to the scaffolding in May 1962 showing no sign
of remorse.
It was never explained to the boy why his father suddenly and
mysteriously disappeared. ''My mother hardly spoke about him. I only
found out gradually, it was a long drawn-out shock.''
In a separate interview with Israel's Haaretz newspaper, he said he
had kept his identity as Eichmann's son a secret from his students and
his two children, aged six and eight.
''I did tell my wife, and yesterday, after I went public in the media,
I also told my two boys the truth about their grandfather,'' said
Eichmann.
''I can promise you one thing -- if the Nazis came to power again in
Germany, I would pack a small bag for each of the children and we would
get out of here.''--Reuter.

Sue Tranter finds there's more to interior designers than a pleasant
colour scheme and wallpaper to match.
YOU might be forgiven for wondering why it can take five years to
aquire a degree in interior design. There's an understandable perception
of the job as nothing more than messing around with curtain fabric and
choosing some pretty wallpaper to match.
Sandra Gunn, senior lecturer at the College of Building and Printing,
is quick to put the record straight. ''That's just a very small part of
the work involved,'' she says.
A properly-qualified designer needs to be as comfortable with the
workings of a building's drainage system as with the sofas and chairs.
While the course work involves decoration, it also includes
architecture, technical drawing, planning, and construction.
The importance of interior design has grown dramatically since the
sixties. Names like Terence Conran became synonymous with style in the
home, and retailers began to realise that a shop's environment was as
important to creating sales as the right merchandise. Even the recession
has failed to clip the wings of the interior designer, whose star is
still in the ascendant.
Of course the recession has made a difference to job prospects for
design students, but with less new building in progress, much more
emphasis has been put on making over and refurbishing old buildings and
office space. Even architects have switched to interior design.
In Scotland, the art colleges in Dundee and Glasgow both offer degree
courses, along with Napier University and the College of Building and
Printing in Glasgow.
Another option is the short foundation course for those who want to
get a taste of the subjects involved.
''We find it popular with people wanting to make a career change or
others who simply want to find out what subjects are covered,'' says
Sandra.
Rather than being put off by the diversity of skills required, the
drop-out rate is remarkably small, with over 90% going on to take a
2-year HNC course.
Sandra is also bullish about the prospects for students leaving the
college with a qualification.
''Of course all design courses are very competitive and we work hard
to make students see that,'' she says. ''Some students go into
architectural practices, others to the retail sector or companies like
Habitat. We also have students in Canada, Hong Kong, South Africa, and
Kenya. Some have joined London architectural practices.''
According to Sandra, the bulk of the jobs are in the public sector
rather than domestic interiors, where the fact that a good environment
gives a much richer quality of life is not lost on employers and
retailers.
With Glasgow gearing up to become city of architecture in 1999, Sandra
cannot resist making the point that much of its reputation has been made
on the back of design in recent years.
Henrietta Simpson, who founded Design Works in Gibson Street, Glasgow,
in 1982, now has 14 people working for her. When taking on new young
designers she admits she would always look for a formal qualification.
She began her own career at art college in Dundee and then spent five
years working as an architect's assistant.
''Architectural expertise is really the backbone of the business,''
she says. ''Overcoming problems and finding solutions can mean knowing
how to move a drainage system.''
''Too many people are not really trained in the fine detail and don't
have a professional grounding. They look for an answer that will do
rather than the best solution.''
While the prospects for acquiring that essential grounding through
formal training have improved, a certain amount of stigma is still
attached to the role of domestic designers. The view that they are
expensive lingers on, though Henrietta believes that perception is
slowly disappearing. And she is adamant that her job is to work with
clients rather than impose her taste upon them.
''If you can see my stamp on the finished job, then I consider I have
failed,'' she says.
That's a lesson that any young designer will need to take on board
pretty quickly.

Sunset Boulevard left its rivals in the shade at the Tony awards, as
ALLAN LAING reports
THEY say the neon lights were bright on Broadway yesterday for Sir
Andrew Lloyd Webber as his latest production, Sunset Boulevard, scooped
a host of prizes, including best musical and best actress in a musical,
in the prestige Tony Awards, America's theatrical Oscars.
However, there may well have been something of a sense of deja vu for
the composer. His grand total of seven awards for Sunset equalled the
clutch of Tonys he received for Evita (in 1980), for Cats (1983), and
for Phantom of the Opera (1989). All that was different was the
permutation.
This time, in addition to best musical and best actress (for Glenn
Close), his show took best featured actor in a musical (George Hearn),
best set design (John Napier), best lighting (Andrew Bridge), as well as
best score and best book of the musical.
But Sunset Boulevard was not the only British bullet over Broadway. At
the less glitzy end of the Tonys, English actor Ralph Fiennes was named
as best actor in a play for his portrayal of Hamlet, a version of
Shakespeare which started its theatrical life far away from the New York
limelight -- on the stage at the Hackney Empire. For Fiennes, cruelly
robbed of the chance of an Oscar for his role in Schindler's List last
year, the stage award will come as much more than a consolation prize.
The success of these British productions (there were many more
nominations, including a record-equalling nine for the Royal National
Theatre's production of Cocteau's Les Parents Terrible, retitled as
Indiscretions for the American market; two for Tom Stoppard's Arcadia;
and one for Helen Mirren in A Month In The Country) illustrates not only
the ailing Broadway's dependency on theatre which has already been
tried-and-tested in the UK, but also the fact that New York audiences
are suckers for a British accent.
Lloyd Webber's success, however, owes a great deal to Glenn Close for
her bravura performance as the fading Hollywood star, Norma, ''I'm ready
for my close-up, Mr de Mille'' Desmond. And to think that she almost
didn't make it. At one point it was thought that she had suffered the
Curse of Sunset Boulevard, a fate which had already befallen the
previous two divas linked to the role.
First it was Patty LuPane, who played the part (made famous in the
original celluloid version by Gloria Swanson) in the world premiere in
London in 1993, and assumed that she was to do likewise in New York. She
later discovered, through newspaper gossip columns, that Sir Andrew was
set to replace her on Broadway with Ms Close (who had been lavishly
praised by critics for her Norma Desmond performance in Los Angeles).
Then came Norma Desmond III, The Nightmare Continues, with the
celebrated contretemps between Sir Andrew and Faye Dunaway. Ms Dunaway,
great actress, classic prima donna, but perhaps not the world's most
obvious diva, was scheduled to take over from Ms Close in LA. Then Sir
Andrew heard her sing. The row over her subsequent dismissal ended with
an out-of-court settlement, reputed to be about #1m.
Finally, earlier this year, relations between Ms Close and Sir Andrew
became strained when the actress declared that she was ''furious and
insulted'' after discovering that, while she was on a two-week break,
officials from Sir Andrew's theatre company had distorted box office
figures to make her understudy look more popular. The row ended a few
days later with declarations of mutual admiration all round.
Nevertheless, Sunset Boulevard, which is based on Billy Wilder's
wonderfully malicious and cynical bite upon the Hollywood hand that fed
him (and the only movie, incidently, ever to be narrated by a corpse),
has broken all known box office records on Broadway (best advance
bookings, best monthly and best daily sales).
Waking up yesterday morning to his latest success, Sir Andrew
telephoned his office in London to declare: ''I am absolutely delighted.
It is much more than we could possibly have hoped for. It was a rare
occasion and I am thrilled.'' To paraphrase Ms Desmond, there are no
signs that Sir Andrew has been, or ever will be, found sleepwalking
along the giddy heights of a lost career.

TODAY the Hanging Shed stands locked and derelict. The grim years of
its use are behind it. The shed itself has now been condemned to create
more room for prisoners at Barlinnie, Glasgow.
The death cell opposite -- exactly eight paces away across the landing
-- is used as a store for bins and buckets, cleaning materials and
dozens of the ubiquitous white plastic chamber pots which still, to our
shame, are a feature of modern prison life in Scotland.
The condemned cell is twice as large as other Barlinnie cells and has
no mark or number above the door. The extra space was to allow for two
officers who kept the death watch, men brought from another prison who
sat with the condemned man during his final days.
As we looked yesterday into the cell, one younger officer remarked:
''It must have been terrible. What could you find to chat about? What
could you say? Discuss the game the following Saturday?''
The late Paddy Meehan, the safebreaker, who served time in Barlinnie
as a young man and absorbed the legends, said that the Bar-L gallows
were primitive and made a terrific bang when used. After the first three
hangings they were altered to reduce the banging. Since the hanging
suite and condemned cell were on the second floor and very much part of
main hall, the build-up of tension throughout the night and the feelings
of impotence and horror among the 200-odd other men locked behind their
doors literally feet away can be well imagined.
The Barlinnie executions seem to have been carried out by Albert
Pierrepoint and his assistant. Pierrepoint could size up a condemned man
at a glance and plan the drop accordingly.
At the appointed hour, the two death watch officers led the murderer
to the cell door where they handed him over to two other officers, also
from another prison. They led him across the landing, through the
execution chamber door, passing him to two other officers. The adjacent
cells in the suite are numbered 29 and 30.
His hands were instantly pinioned behind his back with a leather
strap, a hood placed over his head and he was placed on the trapdoor. In
the roof above the trapdoor is a row of four rings. These were to secure
the safety harness to which the two officers who held the murderer's
arms were attached.
The hangman's assistant then pulled a lever, opening the trapdoor.
The configuration of the hanging suite is intact and recognisable.
Extending over three floors, the top room is occupied by a heavy wooden
beam in which are inserted three locking pin devices to which ropes
could be attached.
The ropes dropped down through three small square holes into the
hanging chamber below. Below that again was a room with a sand pit to
catch excrement and body fluids from the hanging corpse and beside that
was a mortuary slab.
The body was removed immediately after certification of death through
an outside door into the yard and placed in a ready-dug grave with quick
lime.
For years the initials of hanged men were carved on the wall of the
hanging chamber immediately above the graves. The mark where they were
chipped off is still there, although no one knows who removed them or
why.
The three death chambers are linked vertically by an iron ladder and
are now derelict and full of pigeon dung. Older officers can recall that
legends abounded in D Hall, men who heard footsteps on the flagstones in
the long reaches of the night, but saw no one, others who saw a a
prisoner when nobody should have been about.
In reality the paraphernalia of death is impressive only by its sheer
banality. The hanging shed is cold and stinking; any meaning it carries
comes only from the imagination.

IRAN looks set to drop the threat to carry out a death sentence on
British author Salman Rushdie.
''Our government is not going to dispatch anybody, any commandos, to
kill anybody in Europe,'' Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said in a
BBC radio interview in Tehran.
BBC reporter Mark Coles said Iran was expected to send a delegation to
Europe within the next two weeks to reply formally to a proposal made in
April by the European Union.
The EU offered better trade and political links with Iran in return
for a guarantee over Rushdie's safety in each of its 15 member states.
''This is our determination to expand our relations with Europe. This
is a new chance for us,'' said Velayati.
A fatwa, or death sentence, was imposed in 1989 by the late Ayatollah
Khomeini over Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, which Iran considered
a blasphemy against Islam.
Rushdie has been in hiding ever since, making only rare public
appearances over the past six years.
Coles spoke to a number of leading Iranian clerics and government
advisers and said signs of a solution were promising.--Reuter.

Oh brother! Anvar Khan examines the relative merits of David and Alan
Knox, who have the same family name but very different attitudes to life
The highlight of my childhood was making my brother laugh so hard that
food came out of his nose -- Garrison Keillor
President Abraham Lincoln used to tell of a boy who was carrying an
even smaller boy up a hill. Asked whether the heavy burden was not too
much for him, the boy answered: ''It's not a burden, it's my brother!''
-- 1942 Christmas broadcast
DAVID KNOX maintains that he is the best singer in the family, a fact
disputed by his every other relative. His song is Satisfaction, as in
''guaranteed''. (He likes to think he's a big hit with the ladies too.)
David is to his brother Alan, who is three years older, what rats are
to Rentokil -- a pest. The quieter of the two brothers, he is not always
impressed by his wee brother's ebullience. On his childhood, he says,
''I got bullied by David. I never pulled a fist back in anger.'' Alan
tells me he should have slapped David down more when he was a boy, and
put him in his place. He blames himself.
The qualities of David, 24, a superviser at a local firm in
Portobello, and Alan, 27, a painting and decorator instructor at
Ochilview Young Offenders' Institute in Stirling, can be compared to
their parents. Linda and Alec Knox have the same differences. Their mum
is full of fun and sings Brenda Lee numbers at parties. Her husband Alec
is a more reticent chap, a father who, as Alan recalls, is so shy he
used ''to go away and have a wee lie down'' every time assorted members
of the family came to visit.
We are seated in the sunny living-room of David's house in Edinburgh,
a home he shares with his wife Michelle and their son Greg, a wee mite
of a toddler who decides quite early on in the interview to ram his
one-seater truck into my armchair.
He and his granny are despatched to play with his toys upstairs. He
must be growing up, bricks and guns aren't as interesting as they once
were; he's taken for a walk outside in the heat instead.
The biggest bone of contention between Alan and David revolves around
football, and their different interpretations of success. They have a
mutual animosity regarding the subject which will last a lifetime. To
cut a long story short, Alan and David are the products of a merger of
two families -- the Knoxes and the Ewings.
The Ewings have always been sporty. David's and Alan's cousin, also
called David, was a good amateur rugby player. David's and Alan's uncle
Davy (also called David), was the most sucessful footballer in the
family. Aberdeen signed him.
It could be interpreted that the bloodline is trail-blazing,
competitive. But that isn't true. The basis for all arguments between
David and Alan Knox is that nature isn't democratic. She didn't give
them an equal share of talent or personality.
''Alan was never the power-crazy big brother, he was the quiet one,''
David Knox affirms. ''I'm loud, he's withdrawn. Between 10 and 18 I was
being picked up by scouts. The light shone on me and Alan was in the
background, I thought he didn't like me for that.''
David insists that his big brother Alan showed the most ability in
football but never used it, while he had less and gave it 100%. This is
what galls him.
''Alan always had all the ability but, to use the scheme term, the
bottle would crash. He didn't believe in himself, whereas I did. Mention
competition to Alan and the confidence goes, the barriers come up. I
knew in my mind that Alan was a far better footballer than me. The fact
that he always held back annoyed me.''
As they were both growing up and out, the subject of football was
never broached in the home. The one exercise which united them in love
but divided them in ambition, was never talked about. It was ''a closed
door'', until one day, injury prevented David from pursuing his dream of
fame. ''When I was 16 I started getting operations on my leg and it all
petered out after that.''
What incenses David is the belief that his big brother could have been
the one on the telly. A place he was prepared to fight harder to get.
Alan has a different side to the story. He testifies to David's
ability, but also his ruthlessness. His wee brother lives by his own
ultimate personal truth, that to stop competing is as good as putting
the last nail in your coffin. Alan however, never believed that quality
of life was somehow marred by anonymity.
''If ever we played football, it could have been five-a-sides on
Astroturf but David was in the World Cup final, and he's an extremely
bad loser. To me, football was more of a laugh,'' he chats. ''Everybody
likes to win, but David took it much more seriously. If he lost the
heid, he'd pick on me. I'd ignore it and he'd shout 'Get your finger
out!'.''
Alan admits that he has always had difficulty putting himself on the
line. He's shy. ''When I was younger, if there was a chance of playing
for the under-11s, I wouldn't go. I didn't feel brave enough to go. When
I was seven my Dad bought me my first golf club, and that was me, I went
golf daft and broke away from football.''
He goes on: ''I think David's bitter because he got an injury and was
near making it -- he got trials with Rangers, Hibs, Dunfermline. I feel
sorry for him. My Dad never showed much, but he was quite upset when it
started to dawn on him that David wasn't going to make it. That got to
him.''
Like many amateur Scots footballers, David and Alan Knox believe they
missed the chance of breaking into the big time. The biggest difference
is, however, that David's complaint is not a question of the talent he
may or may not have had, but the fact that he couldn't improve it. He
never got the chance to go public.
''My Dad is one of the best artists you'll ever see,'' David enthuses.
''He went to night classes and the teacher once asked him if he'd take
the class for the last four sessions. I remember when my Granda got one
of his paintings valued, my Dad lost the head.''
His big brother Alan is like his Dad. He's not really bothered.
Talent, he deep breathes, can be a private affair.

<TEXT>
Apalachicola, Monday
HURRICANE Allison sputtered along Florida's Gulf Coast today, dumping
heavy rain on a string of fishing villages and churning up one of the
state's prime oyster bays.
Allison, which barely qualified as a hurricane with 75mph maximum
sustained winds, was the earliest hurricane to hit Florida in decades,
according to forecasters at the National Hurricane Centre.
It took many residents by surprise, forming rapidly after the
beginning of the Atlantic hurricane season last week.
Although outer bands of the storm made landfall shortly after dawn,
the centre swerved east and pushed along the coast. Residents of the
fishing communities and beach resorts along Florida's Panhandle braced
for flooding, a storm surge of up to 10ft, and possible tornadoes.
The storm hit Apalachicola, a tiny fishing village about 70 miles
south-west of Tallahassee. The area is known for its shallow oyster bay,
which is vulnerable to damage from flooding and pounding waves.
Alan Pierce, emergency management director for Apalachicola and
surrounding Franklin County, said the storm lost much of its punch as it
drew near the shore.
''Something went wrong, or right, depending on how you look at it.
This storm fizzled about 2am,'' Pierce said.
Storm bands surrounding Allison dumped more than 5in of rain ahead of
the hurricane's landfall. Several more inches of rain were expected.
Fishermen spent yesterday tying down craft or pulling smaller vessels
out of the water to ride out the storm. ''I must have tied about 40
miles worth of knots yesterday,'' one said.
Governor Lawton Chiles earlier declared a state of emergency along the
north-west and central Gulf Coast areas and urged residents to make
emergency preparations. Some 1500 people gathered at shelters in
schools.
Allison strengthened quickly to hurricane force after forming on
Saturday in the Caribbean Sea off the Central American coast.
OSLO: Troops and volunteer workers urgently built barriers yesterday
against Norway's worst floods for 125 years, with a peak expected later
in the week.
One thousand soldiers were helping to erect a three-mile high wall of
sandbags to protect Lillestroem, a town of 10,000 just east of Oslo,
against nearby flooded lake Oeyeren.
One death has been reported and more than 4000 people have been
evacuated from areas flooded by melting snow and heavy rains in the
worst such disaster since water levels were first monitored.--Reuter.

Joan McFadden finds cause for worry as a new book lifts the lid on
baby foods
AS an average, angst-ridden mother, I have been wooed by enticing
brand names and have fallen hook, line and sinker for the soft-focus
imagery of gentle grannies simmering pots of home-made delicacies for
tiny tots.
But the fact is that food companies are intent in peddling an image of
natural foodstuffs, free of additives, which is far from the truth, as
Drew Smith reveals in his startling book -- Baby Foodwatch.
This is more than a reference book, and much more than a simple guide.
It is an expose, guaranteed to send the most laid back of parents
scurrying to check out the contents of their food cupboards.
I pride myself on being cynical enough to shrug off insidious
advertising, but where my children are concerned I am clearly
vulnerable. My only comfort is, I am not alone. Baby food manufacturers
are well aware of this parental blindness, and have targeted it
extremely successfully. There is a great deal of money to be made in
this particular area, while suspect public relations gloss over
disturbing facts with half-truths and a baffling wall of science.
Smith promises to set out all the facts about the multitude of baby
foods currently available. He discusses a healthy diet in pregnancy, the
benefits of breast-feeding, vegetarian options, the case against
additives and all the other dilemmas parents face as they attempt to
give their children the best possible nutritional start in life. On
these grounds alone this book would be a success as it is a very easy
read, with excellent indexing. The author lists all the baby foods and
drinks, and details exactly what the ingredients include.
For instance, maltodextrine is one of the most controversial agents
used in baby foods, claims Smith, but despite being around since the
late 70s there is surprisingly little public comment about what is
essentially a pure additive.
Smith raises three issues of serious concern in his discussion on
maltodextrine. It allegedly contributes nothing good to the diet in
itself and once eaten is broken down to sugar. Secondly, feeding babies
on products containing maltodextrine familiarises their taste buds with
exactly the type of junk food we are being warned against eating.
Finally, why is there no concern about a whole generation being raised
on a foodstuff which no-one else has ever consumed? As it is probably
everything most parents would not want their children to eat, you cannot
help but wonder about the quality of all convenience baby foods.
In favour of baby foods, there has been a swing towards organic
products and these are also faithfully inspected and reported on by
Smith. Although he is scathing about poor quality, he is equally
generous with praise for good foods. A useful summing up covers a list
of the most common foods and their good and bad points, advises on
hygiene, and how to understand labelling.
This book is for everyone, as it forces us parents to look much more
carefully at the food we eat, as well as the products designed
especially for babies.
The book is essential for parents, even if you cannot help but react
with anger while reading it. I cleared my kitchen cupboards, completely
reorganised my children's diet, and loudly recommended the book to all
my friends after reading it. As I imagine this to be a fairly typical
reaction, I hope the baby-food manufacturers are quaking in their boots.

NEVILLE RIGBY on a language for the cradle
IF the Gaelic tongue remains a language under threat, its resurgence
will owe as much to simple children's rhymes as much as determined
instruction in the classroom.
Bold moves are underway to make Gaelic the language of the cradle for
a new generation including some who may have only the remotest
connections with the Highlands and Islands. In the vanguard is Canadian
lawyer Robert Dunbar who is attempting to establish a Gaelic-medium
nursery in the heart of London.
He is determined his son Alastair, even at the tender age of one,
should grow up with a clear sense of his roots. Dunbar first heard
Gaelic being spoken at his grandparents' knee in Cape Breton, Nova
Scotia, where an enclave of die-hard Scottish descendants strive to
retain their identity. Oddly, it was living in Toronto that enabled
Dunbar, a postgraduate law student, to perfect his Gaelic by studying at
evening classes and summer schools.
His interest in providing a Gaelic nursery education for his son came
after meeting Fionnlagh Macleoid, chief executive of the Inverness-based
Comhairle Na Sgoiltean Araich (The Gaelic Nursery Council) during a
visit to Cape Breton. After beginning his masters at London University,
Dunbar, 34, decided he would try to get the nursery idea off the ground
and has been casting around for suitable staff.
The CNSA is backing the move and hopes to open Scotland's first
full-time Gaelic-only nursery in Inverness shortly. It has a budget of
#600,000 to fund a development programme which already embraces 140
pre-school groups across Scotland, attended by 2600 children. There is a
group of 10 Canadian children affiliated in Cape Breton.
''In the past 10 years a change has taken place. Soon we are going to
find an upsurge in the number of under-15s speaking the language. But it
takes time to work through. I would have preferred that this had
happened 40 years ago,'' lamented Fionnlagh MacLeoid.
Chrissie Martin, CNSA training and development officer in Glasgow, who
already has 95 children taking part in Gaelic sessions in 10 part-time
playgroups,said: ''It is amazing how quickly children pick it up.''
Donald Meek, professor of Celtic Studies at Aberdeen University, said:
''The earlier they start the better. There is a growing awareness of the
value of being able to speak at least two languages. It is just here in
mainland Britain we are insular in terms of having one language.
''What needs to be done is a rejuventation of the language as quickly
as possible. Television is important because it gives the language a
contemporary relevance.''
It will be a strange twist if the first steps towards teaching the
tiniest tots is taken by a Canadian in London.

THE first man to be hanged in Barlinnie was 21-year-old John Lyon --
on February 8, 1946. Lyon was executed for his part in the murder of on
October 20, 1945, in Washington Street, Glasgow, of John Brady, a Royal
Navy sailor awaiting his discharge papers.
The previous hanging in the city was in Duke Street Prison 17 years
before when George Reynolds was executed for killing a bakehouse
fireman. In earlier times a black flag was flown from prisons to show an
execution had taken place, but this practice had been discontinued by
1946.
The first indication the execution had been carried out was a
typewritten notice pinned on the prison gate at 8.15am. It read: ''We
the undersigned hereby declare that sentence of death was this day
executed on John Lyon, in the prison of Barlinnie, in our presence.''
This was followed by the signatures of two magistrates, Bailie James
Duff and Bailie Hugh Fraser, of Mr Robert Richmond, deputy town clerk,
of Mr J.P. Mayo, the Barlinnie governor, Dr G.M. Scott, the medical
officer and the Barlinnie chaplain, the Rev John Campbell.
The Glasgow Herald of the day recorded that police held up about 70
spectators on the private roadway about 100 yards from the prison gates.
After the main party had left the prison, the spectators were allowed to
approach the gates. Lyon's younger brother, his sister-in-law, and his
father-in-law, Mr Robert Crosbie, were among those who read the notice.
At an inquiry before Sheriff Macdiarmid at the County Buildings,
Glasgow, Mr Mayo, the governor, gave evidence that the sentence was
carried out at two minutes past eight and the body buried within the
prison precinct. The two magistrates also gave evidence, Bailie Duff
saying he had asked the prisoner if he was John Lyon and if he had
anything to say. The prisoner gave his name and added he had nothing to
say.
Two months later, on April 6, Patrick Carraher, aged 39, walked the
same fateful eight steps across the landing. Carraher, of 14 Tarbet
Street, Glasgow, was hanged for the murder of John Gordon, Jnr, of
Aitken Street, Glasgow, by stabbing him in the neck.
An appeal against Lord Russell's death sentence was dismissed and a
petition failed.
Carraher had twice before been before the High Court on charges of
murder. On the first occasion a jury returned a majority verdict of
culpable homicide and he was jailed for three years. On a subsequent
occasion he received another three-year sentence for using a lethal
weapon in an assault.
Later that year, John Caldwell, aged 20, was hanged for the murder of
a former detective sergeant, James Straiton, in Edinburgh Road,
Carntyne, Glasgow. He made no last statement as he went to the scaffold
and his death was witnessed by Bailie S. J. Scott Adamson and Bailie
John M. Inglis.
In a celebrated case on October 30, 1950, Paul Christopher Harris,
aged 28, was hanged for the murder of Martin Dunleavy of Neptune Street,
Glasgow, but his brother, Claude Milton Harris, 30, had a sentence of
execution imposed on him for the same killing postponed for several days
on the order of the Scottish Secretary.
This was to permit consideration of statements made by Paul Harris on
the eve of execution -- confessions which later led to Claude Harris'
reprieve. The Glasgow Herald faithfully recorded the names of the depute
town clerk and the two bailies who witnessed the execution.
Just over two weeks later, on December 16, 1950, another celebrated
case which intrigued the Scottish public for months culminated in the
hanging of a policeman, James Ronald Robertson, 33, who had become
entangled in an extra-marital affair while carrying out his duties as a
constable. He murdered the ''other'' woman in the triangle -- Catherine
McCluskey, 40, of Nicholson Street, Glasgow, by driving his car over her
in Prospecthill Road and then reversing over the body.
The car as murder weapon caught the public imagination and the
forensic evidence involving the tyre marks played a key part in securing
the conviction.
On May 29, 1952, Patrick Gallacher Deveney, 42, went to the gallows
for strangling his wife at their home, 115 Blackburn Street, Glasgow.
His execution merited a single paragraph inside the Glasgow Herald.
The following year, on January 26, George Francis Shaw walked to the
gallows, his execution delayed a month by an appeal. When asked if he
had anything to say as he was led to the scaffold, Shaw said: ''I am as
innocent as anyone,'' words recorded by Bailie R.A. Cuthbertson and the
other magistrate who witnessed the hanging. He died at 8.02am as did all
the others.
Shaw had been sentenced to death by Lord Carmont for the murder of a
man at Huntlygate Farm, Lanark. A co-accused, George Dunn, 22, was
ordered to be detained in a mental institution, after being found guilty
of culpable homicide.
The most famous Scottish killer, Peter Thomas Anthony Manuel, was 32
when he made the fatal walk across the gallery from the condemned cell
to the Barlinnie gallows. Accounts of Manuel's last hours differ.
Afterwards, Bailie John C. Paterson, said that Manuel had had nothing to
say as he went to his death. Bailie John J. Macdougall, who was also
present, reportedly said: ''He made no reference to anything''.
But popular prison mythology, as recounted by the late Paddy Meehan,
has Manuel attempting to commit suicide in the condemned cell by
swallowing Harpic he found behind the toilet. According to Meehan, this
was a well-kept secret.
The story also went that while in the death cell he refused to
converse with any of the prison officers, even those keeping the final
death watch with him, but that as he hurried, almost ran across the
hall, he said: ''Hurry up, a man hasn't much time left'' -- his final
words.
Manuel's serial killings struck fear throughout Lanarkshire and
Glasgow in the late 50s and he was eventually convicted of seven
murders. Contrary to general public misconception, Manuel was not the
last man to be hanged in Barlinnie. That was 19 year old Tony Miller,
and the last man to be hanged in Scotland was Henry John Burnett, who
went to his death for murder at Craiginches Prison, Aberdeen, on August
15, 1963.
The death penalty was abolished in 1965.

Exclusive: Agony of a murder trial and the anatomy of an exection are
relived by Len Murray.
A telephone call 35 years ago began a trail of events which left an
indelible mark on one of Scotland's top lawyers. In an extract from his
forthcoming book he relives the death of a teenager - despite appeals
and petitions.
THE voice at the other end of the telephone said: ''My name is Alf
Miller. You don't know me. I need your help. My son has just been
charged with capital murder.'' He did need my help.
It was a lovely August afternoon in 1960. I had been working in my
room at the office and I had not wanted to be disturbed. Quickly I
realised that I had no right feel irritated, this man's need was more
important than any job I might have on my desk.
Within the half hour Alf Miller and his wife were sitting opposite me
and the story began to unfold. Their 19-year-old son Tony had been
charged that afternoon along with 16-year-old boy James Denovan with a
murder which had taken place in Queen's Park Recreation Ground in
Glasgow some months before.
Denovan had been on remand in connection with another case when in an
interview about something totally different he had broken down and
blurted out the story of how he and Tony Miller had been carrying out a
series of attacks on homosexuals in Queen's Park Recreation Ground and
one of them had died.
Denovan had acted as the lure. Once the victim had been distracted by
Denovan, Miller came from behind to assault and rob him. All of their
victims were homosexuals and so they never reported their experience to
the police.
In those days certain types of murder were still capital crimes and
involved the death penalty in the event of conviction. One such type was
murder in the course of furtherance of theft. In this case it was
alleged that the assault from which their victim died was carried out
during their robbery of him.
If Tony Miller was convicted he would hang. James Denovan would not
hang because he was too young.
''But they can't hang Tony, can they?'' asked his mother who had
hardly taken any part in the discussion so far.
His mother thought that no-one under 21 could be sentenced to death
and I had the task of telling her that 18 and not 21 was the minimum age
for hanging.
I interviewed Anthony Joseph Miller at Craigie Street Police Office. A
slim rather sallow youth with hair that was drilled into place with oil,
he did not say very much at that stage.
The following day he appeared in Glasgow Sheriff Court along with
James Douglas Denovan and they were both charged with murder.
The allegation was that on April 6, 1960, in Queen's Park Recreation
Ground they had assaulted John Cremin, struck him on the head with a
piece of wood or other similar instrument, knocked him down, robbed him
of a bank book, a watch, a knife and #67 of money and did murder him.
There were various other lesser charges of assaults and robberies.
To defend Tony Miller I instructed two junior counsel, Irvine Smith
and Alasdair Macdonald. I had instructed them the year before in what
was my first capital murder trial so we were used to working with each
other.
The victim of the murder, John Cremin, was a man in his fifties, a
homosexual, and a thief.
During the weeks that followed as we were investigating and preparing
for the trial I consciously built up a kind of emotional barrier between
Miller and myself.
The previous year when I had my first capital murder I was frightened
for my own sake -- frightened of how I would react if my client were to
hang; frightened of the emotional effect that it would all have on me.
This time I wanted to ensure as far as I could that I would be
unaffected. I did not realise that I would fail so miserably.
An oddity about the case was that when Cremin's body was found it was
first thought that death had been from natural causes. He had been
wearing a cap that night and this had tended to hide any injury. It was
only when a post mortem was carried out and a massive subdural
haemorrhage was found that it was realised that this was no natural
death. Only a severe blow on the head could have caused such a
haemorrhage.
The two doctors who carried out the post mortem were two of the
country's most experienced and most respected pathologists, James
Rentoul and Walter Pollock Weir. They had no doubt that a hefty blow
from a flat surface object, such as a piece of wood, caused the fatal
injury.
The evidence implicating Miller and Denovan in the murder charge came
from several sources. The pair had been in the habit of frequenting the
Cathkin Cafe in Victoria Road in Glasgow's south side. A number of their
friends had told the police how Miller and Denovan had often boasted in
the cafe of what they had done to Cremin.
Some of them even spoke of one ghoulish moment when the two accused
pointed out the very spot in the Recreation Ground where Cremin had been
assaulted and had 'flaked' in their words. Denovan had suggested that
they observe two minutes' silence for him.
Miller and Denovan had also been seen in possession of Cremin's bank
book and they had also been seen with new bank notes.
The evidence against them then was overwhelming.
The trial began in Glasgow High Court on Monday, November 14, 1960.
The presiding judge was Lord Wheatley who would subsequently be
appointed to the post of Lord Justice Clerk, the second highest judicial
office in the country.
By the second day of the trial the issue had become confined to only
the capital charge because both Miller and Denovan tendered pleas of
guilty to all the other charges.
Indeed the issue had become even more narrow -- which of the two of
them had struck John Cremin on that fateful night?
This was crucial because in terms of the Homicide Act of 1957 only the
one whose hands had dealt the fatal blow could be hanged (an effort to
ensure that there could be no repeat of the scandal of the case of Craig
and Bentley).
Tony Miller did not give evidence on his own behalf. James Denovan,
however, did give evidence and claimed that the length of wood which was
the murder weapon had been wielded by Tony Miller.
By the Wednesday morning the evidence was over. That afternoon I sat
at the bar of the court throughout the 70 minutes or so of Lord
Wheatley's charge to the jury. It was superb. It would later be
described by Lord Justice General Clyde as ''a model of clarity'' and it
was to become the model on which many Scottish judges and sheriffs were
to base future charges to juries for years to come.
Lord Wheatley told the jury that the consequence of their verdict was
not their affair and he warned them that they must be unaffected by the
consideration that a verdict of guilty of capital murder would involve
the death penalty.
If they were to find that the murder was committed by Miller and it
was committed in the course of furtherance of theft then he said they
''must steel themselves to it''.
When the jury retired at two minutes past three that afternoon, I
reckoned that not even the forensic brilliance of Irvine Smith was going
to be enough to save the life of Tony Miller.
My counsel and I went to the gown room to await the jury's return.
Nowhere does the time pass more slowly than the room where you wait for
a jury's verdict. That was especially so in the days of capital charges.
An eternity had passed since the jury went out, or so it felt. When
the jingle of the bell summoned us back to court, I glanced at my watch.
It was three thirty-five. The jury had only been out for just over half
an hour.
They were already in place and not one of them would meet our
occasional inquisitive glance. I think that in those moments we all knew
what the verdict was going to be.
Miller and Denovan had already been brought up from the cells to their
places in the dock sitting ashed-faced between escorting police
officers.
Donald Stevenson, the senior depute clerk of justiciary, was the clerk
of the court.
''Ladies and gentlemen,'' he asked in a flat emotionless voice, ''who
speaks for you?''
The foreman rose. Donald Stevenson first took from him the formal
verdicts on the charges to which the accused had pled guilty the day
before and then, coming to the third charge on the indictment, which was
the charge of capital murder, he asked quietly: ''What is your verdict
on charge three as regards the accused Miller?''
This was the moment I had dreaded since the thirtieth of August when I
was first instructed in the case.
''Guilty of capital murder.'' The foreman's voice was surprisingly
strong. I sensed that it had taken a special effort for him. The verdict
was unanimous.
Another juror, a man in the back row, was weeping quietly.
''What is your verdict on charge three as regards the accused
Denovan?''
''Guilty of non-capital murder.''
None of us at the bar of the court spoke. I could not.
Donald Stevenson sat down to write out the verdicts in longhand in the
minute book of the court. It took him four minutes to do that. Nothing
could be heard but the quiet weeping of the juror and the movement of
the clerk's plain nibbed pen over the parchment page.
Lord Wheatley then spoke for the first time since the jury had come
back with their verdict: ''Anthony Joseph Miller, in respect of the
verdict of capital murder just received for which the law imposes but
one sentence, the sentence of the court is that you be taken from this
place to the prison of Barlinnie, Glasgow, therein to be detained until
the seventh day of December next and upon that day within the said
prison of Barlinnie, Glasgow, between the hours of eight o'clock and 10
o'clock forenoon you will suffer death by hanging which is pronounced
for doom.''
At the mention of that last phrase he touched his wig with the black
tricorn.
The sentence on Denovan was that he be detained during Her Majesty's
pleasure.
There was something unreal about this. At the age of 27 and with only
three years' experience as a qualified lawyer I had heard a sentence of
death upon this client, a boy of 19.
There then began the fight to save Tony Miller's life.
In Scotland the Appeal Court effectively cannot look at any matter of
fact. A jury's view of the facts of a case is final. What the Appeal
Court can look at is any question of law such as any alleged
misdirection. What we were interested in therefore was whether there had
been any mistake in law or any misdirection of the jury by the presiding
judge.
This meant a minute study of what Lord Wheatley had said in his charge
to the jury. It had been a very careful and painstaking charge but we we
found a number of possible grounds for appeal.
The first was that Lord Wheatley had erred in law when he directed the
jury that they could not consider culpable homicide as a possible
verdict in the case.
Most judges would have given a jury the option of bringing in a
verdict of culpable homicide had they wanted. That would have been one
way for the jury to avoid returning a capital verdict which juries did
not like to bring in.
But Lord Wheatley was never a judge for soft options. As a matter of
law he thought there was no room for culpable homicide so he took away
that option from the jury.
The question which we were taking to the Appeal Court was whether he
was right in doing so.
Another ground of our appeal involved the evidence given by Denovan.
Denovan said that he had no idea that Miller was going to strike such
a severe blow. He did not mind being party to an assault but he did not
want any unnecessary violence. Miller according to him had struck the
fatal blow.
Lord Wheatley told the jury that if they were to disbelieve Denovan in
this then there was not enough evidence to convict Miller of capital
murder. The jury had convicted Denovan, so they must have disbelieved
him at least in part.
Thus, ran our argument, because they had disbelieved Denovan in this,
there had not been enough evidence to convict Miller of capital murder.
Our final ground was, if you like, the blanket cover that the verdict
was contrary to the evidence.
I lodged the appeal on November 25, some nine days after Tony Miller
had been sentenced to death.
In the meantime Tony's father had begun the task of collecting
signatures on a petition to the Secretary of State, asking him to
recommend the exercise of the royal prerogative.
On November 30, the High Court fixed December 7 as the date for
hearing the appeal and postponed the date of execution.
My counsel worked extremely hard in preparing the appeal. Lord
Wheatley's charge was dissected; hours of preparation were put in and
every legal precedent of any relevance was canvassed.
We were not optimistic about our chances in the Appeal Court. It was a
hard line court and only a tiny proportion of criminal appeals ever had
any success. It was the last resort in Scotland and, unlike England,
there was and is no appeal to the House of Lords in criminal matters.
The profession was becoming so disillusioned by the Appeal Court and
its approach to appeals generally that there was much open unrest.
The petition for reprieve was another matter. It had to succeed. There
was every reason to think that it would.
Tony Miller was only nineteen. He had never previously offended. He
came from a good home. No member of his family had ever been in any
bother and the killing was obviously not premeditated.
There was another factor. Many saw a parallel between Miller and
Denovan on the one hand, and the English case of Craig and Bentley on
the other. Craig had been sent to detention while Bentley had hanged.
In the light of all those factors, I could not see Tony Miller being
allowed to hang.
I went up to Barlinnie regularly each week to keep him posted.
I found those to be strange meetings. He seemed to be becoming more
distant or perhaps more resigned. Sometimes I felt as though he was not
very interested in whether the appeal succeeded or not, or even whether
the petition was successful or not.
His attitude was that if it were the will of God then he would be
reprieved. If it were not God's will then it would not happen.
I found this an extraordinary attitude in one so young. In those weeks
following his conviction Tony Miller was acquiring a maturity far beyond
his years.
Our appeal was heard as scheduled on December 7. The judges were the
Lord Justice General Lord Clyde, along with Lords Carmont and Guthrie.
Within minutes of the appeal beginning it became apparent that my worst
fears were going to be realised.
Had we been able to nominate the trio of judges that we would not want
to hear a criminal appeal then we would have picked the three that
presided.
Lord Clyde was not a popular judge. He was very right wing in his
ideas. He was a very difficult judge to appear before in a criminal
appeal.
Lord Carmont had written his name indelibly on the copper plate of the
history of Glasgow by handing out condign punishment to razor slashers
when that particular evil had been reaching epidemic proportions in this
city. But he had not made much else of a contribution to our law and, in
all conscience and in all charity, he was neither the best lawyer nor
the best judge on the bench.
It was rather disheartening to realise that at least two out of the
three judges were not likely to display much sympathy.
Some of the comments which came from the bench during the hearing of
the appeal astonished me. I well remember the Lord Justice General
saying of Miller to Irvine Smith: ''He did not even have the courage to
go into the witness box.''
Until the tail end of the last century it was not possible for an
accused person to give evidence on his own behalf. It only became
competent in 1896. Since then it has always been a recognised and
respected right of an accused person not to give evidence.
To hear Scotland's most senior judge make that comment was something
which those of us who heard it regarded as at least surprising.
The appeal was dismissed in the course of the morning as being
''completely devoid of substance'', a description which I and many
others felt to be thoroughly unwarranted. The grounds were not the
strongest but they were argued with consummate skill.
This was a capital case. A boy's life was at stake but we were made to
feel that it was impertinence to bring that case into the Appeal Court.
We were left with a thoroughly unpleasant taste in our mouths.
A new date for the hanging was fixed -- December 22 -- some fifteen
days ahead. There was no other appeal court to which we might go and all
that was left was our petition to the Secretary of State asking him to
recommend the royal prerogative.
The movement to obtain signatures was stepped up. Alf Miller set up
tables in the city centre to collect signatures. Forms were sent to
factories and large employers of labour throughout Glasgow and the West
of Scotland. Railway stations were manned with canvassers and MPs were
lobbied.
Support was received from people such as Lord Packenham, Baroness
Wootton, Bessie Braddock, Barbara Castle, and Alice Cullen who was then
the MP for Gorbals. Thousands were now signing that petition and
messages of sympathy and offers of help were coming from all over the
country.
When I eventually sent that petition through to the Secretary of
State, John S. Maclay, it had some 30,000 signatures to it.
On Monday, December 19, there was still no word from the Secretary of
State. The press announced that he had postponed a short holiday and
they speculated that the probable reason for the postponement was so
that he could consider our petition for reprieve.
That afternoon, some time after four o'clock, I was advised by my
receptionist that there was a gentleman there from the Scottish Office
who wanted to see me.
I showed him to my room immediately.
He was carrying an envelope which was addressed to me. He proffered
it, telling me that it was from the Secretary of State. I took it and
realised that I was now holding in my hand the official response to our
petition to the Secretary of State.
I remember slitting open that envelope very carefully and taking out
the letter. Both the messenger from the Scottish Office and I were still
standing just inside the door of my room. I went round to my desk and
sat down.
I unfolded the letter nervously. It read:
Sir,
I am directed by the Secretary of State to inform you that after
careful consideration of the case of Anthony Joseph Miller he regrets
that he is unable to find sufficient grounds to justify him in advising
Her Majesty to interfere with the due course of law.
I am, Sir,
Your obedient servant
It was signed by an official at the Scottish Office.
''Christ, I don't believe it.'' I stared at the letter. There was a
mistake. Something had gone wrong.
I looked up at the messenger in utter horror. He had known what the
letter contained. He looked at me for a moment or two and then his eyes
drifted to the floor embarrassed by it all.
My eyes went back to the letter reading and re-reading still wondering
what had gone wrong.
''If you will forgive me, sir.'' It was the messenger from the
Scottish Office and I realised that he was anxious to go. He must have
felt intrusive.
I said goodbye and showed him out of the office. I went downstairs to
my senior partner Willie McRae's room, knocked and went in. I sat down
still dazed by it all. I tossed the letter over to him. He read it
several times.
''Willie,'' I asked, ''What the hell do I do now?''
''Pray'' he said.
I could not believe what was happening. They were actually going to
hang the boy. Here we were in the latter part of the 20th century in a
civilised community which was going to hang a nineteen-year-old boy.
I went in my car to his parents' home. They were not in and I think I
was relieved to realise that. I would have found a meeting with them
very difficult.
Alf Miller came to see me the following morning. He had learnt of the
decision the previous afternoon while at the prison visiting his son. It
would be difficult to say which of us was the more stunned. I remember
thinking how vast was the change in that man in the three or four months
that had passed since our first meeting. He had become old beyond his
years and he looked bent and haggard.
I think that I felt more sympathy for that man that morning that I had
ever felt for anyone. What could we do now apart from praying? All that
I could think of was a direct approach to Her Majesty and accordingly
Tony's father and I sent separate telegrams to Buckingham Palace that
morning.
We now had less than 48 hours. There was nothing more we could do but
wait.
No reply was received from Buckingham Palace on the Tuesday. That
night I telephoned Alice Cullen. She promised that she would do what she
could the following day, Wednesday. However we were running out of time.
He was due to hang on Thursday morning.
Wednesday came. It was a very long day but it came and went with no
word. I had stayed in my office hoping for news, hoping that each time
the telephone rang there would be word of intervention by Her Majesty.
The telephone did ring -- many times -- but not one of the phone calls
was the one I had hoped for.
That night the enormity of the horror of it all came home to me in a
way that it had not done before. The following morning they were going
to hang that boy. Of course, he was no angel and of course he had taken
a life. But at the same time by what right did our society think they
could take his?
An enormous feeling of anger and revulsion grew up inside me.
Until the Miller case I had probably been in favour of capital
punishment.
But I realised that this case had made me a bitter abolitionist. The
barbarity and the futility of it all were inconsistent with our claims
to be a civilised society.
Not only were they going to destroy a life that should be saved, a
life that did not belong to them, but in addition a punishment far
greater than any other that man could ever possibly devise was being
handed out to two innocent individuals -- the parents of the condemned
boy.
At 8.02 on the morning of Thursday, December 22, 1960, Tony Miller was
hanged. It would be the last hanging in Barlinnie prison.

Los Angeles, Monday
THE judge in the O J Simpson murder trial today dismissed two more
jurors, but the defence raced to an appeals court to challenge the
removal of one of the panelists.
The dismissals leave only two alternate jurors in the trial of the
former American football star, who is accused of killing his ex-wife and
her friend.
Superior Court Judge Lance Ito did not say why he dismissed the
jurors, commenting only that he found good cause to dismiss them.
The dismissed jurors were a 28-year-old Hispanic woman who works as a
property valuer, and a 54-year-old black man employed as a postal
operations manager.
They were missing when jurors were escorted from the jury chambers
near the courtroom after Ito's announcement. The judge later cancelled
testimony for the day.
Both jurors have reportedly been under scrutiny for some time.
An ousted black juror complained the Hispanic woman showed signs of
racism against blacks on the panel. The postal operations manager
reportedly intimidated other jurors.
Ito said the defence was filing an appeal, the first time either side
had done so against the dismissal of a juror. It was unknown which juror
the defence wanted to keep.
Unless one dismissal is overturned, today's action means that 10
jurors and alternates have been thrown off the panel since January and
two alternates are left with months to go in the trial. A trial can
proceed with fewer than 12 jurors if both defence and prosecution agree.
Lawyers used the lost testimony time to discuss, outside the jury's
presence, how to handle Simpson's request to be out of the courtroom
during the testimony about the autopsies of Nicole Brown Simpson and
Ronald Goldman. The testimony is expected to include nearly four dozen
grisly photographs.
Prosecutor Brian Kelberg said he did not object to Simpson's absence
but suggested he may be faking grief.
His colleague Marcia Clark said that if Simpson planned to leave, he
should do it before the jury were seated.
''What seems to be proposed,'' she said, ''is that Mr Simpson, at some
point during the coroner's testimony, get up and absent himself in a
show of trauma.''
The judge took the arguments under submission but expressed doubts
about whether a defendant had a right to leave the trial in the middle
of testimony.--AP.

Gus Xhudo argues that the United Nation's peacekeeping task in Bosnia
has failed and it is time for Nato to adopt the mantle of peace
enforcers.
Generations before ours met challenges to democracy and freedom . . .
and now it is time for us to rise to the new challenges posed by the
forces of darkness and disintegration in this age, at home and abroad.''
The irony of President Clinton's words during his address to US
veterans at Arlington is that they were spoken at a time when the
situation in Bosnia continues to deteriorate and UN peacekeepers are
being held hostage in retaliation for Nato air strikes against Serb
positions. Yet when America's long-time allies, Britain and France, have
made sacrifices by placing troops on the ground in Bosnia, America
continues to do little. It appears that President Clinton's bold words
are just that -- words.
While not ruling out air strikes, American Secretary of State Warren
Christopher said at The Hague that the US was not considering sending in
combat troops, but hinted at their limited use in reinforcing UN forces
already on the ground. At the meeting of the five-nation Contact Group,
Christopher called for better equipment for UN personnel and tougher
rules of engagement, while emphasising the belief that the UN should not
abandon Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia in order to reinforce the
areas around Sarajevo. What exactly, does this mean?
This kind of hypocrisy is not what America should be conveying to its
allies at such a crucial time.
The Western Europeans, however, are not free from blame. Some MPs
continue to balk at the idea of a true combat troop deployment in the
Balkans. By vehemently opposing a more active role, they are abrogating
responsibility for settling future conflicts in Europe. More
importantly, what message does this refusal by the EU to engage actively
in Bosnia send to would-be aggressors?
In President Clinton's words: Are not the Serbs the ''new challenge'',
are they not to be counted among the ''forces of darkness'' aimed at the
''disintegration'' of a state recognised by the West? Are not the acts
of hostage-taking challenges to the very foundations of freedom which
peace-loving democracies are meant to prevent.
And what of the United Nations? Its performance, while admirable and
life-saving in some instances, simply has not been sufficient for the
job. Perhaps it is not the fault of the UN. There was little if any
peace for it to keep when it arrived.
Harassed, obstructed, delayed, and subject to a baffling command
apparatus, it appears the moment for its withdrawal has arrived.
The West should consider that recent events demand a new presence in
Bosnia, one which is not subject to bureaucratic delay, one capable of
dealing with events within the military playing field. In short, the
time has come when Nato should step in to replace UN peacekeepers and
engage in the task which should have been carried out originally --
peace creation and enforcement. It is here that America should take the
lead and rally the Atlantic Alliance behind such a proposal. There may
not be a better time.
It has become apparent that Nato air-strikes against Serbian strategic
sites have been successful, despite the downing of a Nato F-16A jet.
And even after capturing UN troops to use ashuman shields, the Serb
leadership in Pale has not called for UN withdrawal. This should send a
clear signal to the West; the Serbs understand fully that the UN, while
it remains within Bosnia, will be restricted to limited intervention.
Even redeploying and strengthening UNPROFOR troops will not lessen the
conflict nor bring about its end. Such measures, while seemingly
proactive, still do not go far enough, since they lack the political
objectives and mandates necessary for any military resolve.
If anything, such tactics may heighten Serb resistance. Bosnian Serbs
seem once again to have distanced themselves from their brethren in
Belgrade, a move designed to rally their fighters into believing that
they have been able to withstand the international community and thwart
it repeatedly.
Recent attacks by the Croatian military in the Krajina may bind rebel
Serbs there closer to Bosnian Serbs, increasing their determination and,
possibly, future attacks against UN forces. The UN personnel have been,
and will continue to be, at the mercy of the combatants.
Replacing them with American-led and more militarily capable Nato
troops will force Serbs into the realisation that these soldiers will
consider them the enemy if attacked. Faced with a revitalised Bosnian
government army and a revamped and re-equipped Croatian army which has
scored recent successes, and with the likelihood that an
economy-battered Serbia will not enter the fray, rebel Serbs may
reconsider engaging in what could be a prolonged Vietnam-type imbroglio.
As for the allies, French threats to withdraw peacekeepers do not
match President Chirac's endorsement of Nato air strikes. Britain, it
seems, is fed-up with half-measures and may back a Nato presence,
particularly if it is dominated by US forces.
America and Bill Clinton have been calling for a new role for Nato and
for its expansion. The administration should consider, however, that
with power comes responsibility. It should take the lead in this
situation.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev, has agreed that Russia
will sign the Nato Partnership for Peace Plan. All the West's diplomatic
influence should now be used to make President Yeltsin and his
hard-liners see that Bosnia represents a legitimate role for Nato, and
one theatre in which Russia should be asked to participate.
This could be either through military co-ordination with Nato or
perhaps by way of a diplomatic role, specifically using its influence
with Serbia to prevent it from rejoining the Bosnian conflict. The offer
of removing sanctions might secure this, although President Slobodan
Milosevic's failure to sway the Bosnian Serb leadership on the hostage
question perhaps reaffirms observers' reports that he is losing
influence with Pale. His intercession, however, would perhaps dissuade
the military and political leadership in Pale from a prolonged war of
attrition.
As for the United Nations, it still has a role in the Balkans.
Peacekeeping in Croatia and in Macedonia should continue in order to
prevent a spillover of the conflict, particularly if Nato were to get
involved. It seems Nato's time has come.

He's a maverick who considers the peace process sectarian and calls
for a progressive 'civic' Unionism. Steve Bruce looks at parliamentary
candidate Robert McCartney's new Unionist philosophy.
NORTH DOWN is the richest part of Northern Ireland. It is also the
most peaceful. Many of the judges and senior civil servants who top the
IRA's hit list live along the coast of Belfast Lough, but they are
protected by large garden walls, infra-red cameras, and a discreet
police presence, and by the fact that men loitering in anything cheaper
than a BMW would be conspicuous.
A week on Thursday North Down will elect a successor to the late Sir
James Kilfedder MP, and the result will be a clear sign of Unionist
reaction to what some call ''the peace process'' and Ian Paisley calls
the beginning of the end.
We know that the farming evangelicals of Ballymena believe the British
Government is preparing to hand Ulster to an alliance in Dublin of John
Hume's constitutional nationalists and Sinn Fein's republicans. But the
voters of North Down are well educated, cultured, and cosmopolitan. Many
are businessmen who should prosper with peace.
If the British and Irish framework for the future -- power-sharing
assembly in the north, institutional balancing of the two opposing
political blocs, an ambiguous constitutional status, and a powerful
all-Ireland agency for matters of mutual concern -- is to find any
Unionist friends it will be among those who every evening drive home to
Holywood, Cultra, and Bangor; 10 miles from the streets of Belfast in
distance but a thousand miles in temperament.
Even before a vote is cast it is clear the Government will find as
little endorsement of its policies in this by-election as in the recent
English and Scottish debacles. Consider the runners. Paisley's DUP is
sitting out. Its evangelical and ethnic Unionism does not play well to
professional people who think of themselves as British rather than
Ulstermen. There are not enough Catholics in North Down to tempt a
nationalist. Transcendental Meditation, the new religion which teaches
its adherents to levitate, is fielding a Natural Law Party
deposit-loser. And an old associate of Kilfedder is running. The list of
the hopeless is completed by a retired school teacher from England who
is standing as a Conservative but who is ignored by those members of his
party who actually run Northern Ireland. That leaves three serious
players.
The main contest is between the Ulster Unionist Party's Alan
McFarland, who rejects the framework of the document, and Robert
McCartney, an independent Unionist who more firmly opposes the
Government's plans and is very critical of the timidity of the Ulster
Unionist Party.
McCartney is the interesting one. Unionism so long rested on numerical
superiority that it rarely produced attractive presentations of its
policies. McCartney is unusual in being intelligent and articulate, a
working-class boy from the Shankill who made very good. The skills that
have made him one of Northern Ireland's best-paid barristers could long
ago have made him the leader of those Unionists who dislike Paisley were
it not for his inability to conceal his sense of superiority.
His political career has been meteoric, a series of abrupt dramatic
interventions which produced great bursts of energy and then petered
out. He came to public notice at a Belfast City Hall rally in November
1981 when, frustrated by the usual rant, he took the microphone from Ian
Paisley and lectured the crowd on the need for a new Unionist
philosophy. His immediate elevation within the Unionist party made him
enemies. His later decision to lead the Campaign for Equal Citizenship,
which urged national parties to organise in Northern Ireland, made him
more. In 1987 he was expelled from the Unionist Party for breaking a
pan-Unionist non-aggression pact by standing against Kilfedder.
To many young Unionists McCartney is a charismatic leader who has
articulated a new justification for their politics. The Unionism of
Paisley's DUP and half of the Ulster Unionist Party is an ethnic
politics. It argues for the right of self-determination of the
Protestant people in a way that mirrors the nationalist case.
McCartney eschews such ethnic rhetoric and argues for a non-sectarian
and progressive ''civic'' Unionism. However badly the Unionist party may
have behaved in the past, remaining part of the UK is desirable for
everyone in Northern Ireland because Britain is a modern liberal
democracy which tolerates religious and cultural diversity. The ''peace
process'' has to be rejected precisely because it is sectarian. It
treats the population of Northern Ireland not as British citizens with
individual rights but as members of two opposing ethnic camps whose
interests are to be served by an undemocratic divvy of power.
The third serious candidate is the only one who endorses the
British-Irish framework. From 1972 to 1984 Sir Oliver Napier was leader
of the Alliance, which he helped to found. In the short-lived
power-sharing executive of 1974 he was head of the Office of Law Reform.
As the elder statesman of compromise politics his selection should have
provided a focus for that constituency which British politicians imagine
when they talk about Ulster MPs being unrepresentative of the ordinary
people of Northern Ireland. That Napier is trailing badly rather calls
into question such imaginings.

Tokyo, Monday
IT WAS supposed to have been a way of laying to rest the legacy of the
Second World War. Instead, it has become a war unto itself.
As Japan's leaders slug it out over a parliamentary resolution marking
the 50th anniversary of the war's end, what began as a mop-up grows
messier each day.
Japan's splintered coalition government sought desperately today to
reach a compromise on how, or even if, Japan should apologise for its
actions during the war.
The approaching anniversary of Japan's August 15 surrender has given
new urgency to the controversy.
The debate is not confined to Japan. In South Korea, hundreds took to
the streets of Seoul today to protest against weekend remarks by a
prominent Japanese politician who contended -- in defence of one draft
of the resolution -- that the Korean Peninsula was not forcibly
colonised by Japan.
South Korean officials today threatened to take strong but unspecified
measures unless former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe retracted his
remarks.
Tonight, Watanabe apologised, dropping his description of Korea's
annexation by treaty as ''peacefully'' concluded. He also acknowledged
''that during Japan's 36-year rule over the Korean Peninsula we caused
unbearable suffering for the people of that region''.
Anti-Japanese sentiment is strong in South Korea. Many Koreans,
especially the elderly, still vividly remember atrocities committed by
Japan during its colonial rule of the peninsula in 1910-45.
More reminders of Japan's wartime aggression came today as the
government declassified thousands of pages of documents covering secret
parliamentary meetings before and during the war.
In a behind-the-scenes glimpse of Japan's war preparations, the papers
depict how almost a year before Pearl Harbour, Japan's Prime Minister
viewed war with the United States as inevitable.
Fumimaro Konoe, Prime Minister from 1937-39 and 1940-41, told a secret
meeting of the House of Peers that to prepare for that war, Japan needed
to bring in labourers from the Korean Peninsula and strengthen its
alliance with Germany and Italy, according to the declassified
documents.
Although the newly released records contained no big surprises, the
declassification was hailed by scholars.
However the documents were censored, and reams of more historically
vital information remains under lock and key.
Japan's former enemies, particularly China and South Korea, have often
criticised Tokyo for trying to whitewash its past and are closely
watching the current debate.
On the political front, leaders of the parties that make up Japan's
ruling coalition -- having already missed a self-imposed deadline of
Friday last week -- said they still hoped to reach a compromise in time
for passage of the resolution during the current parliamentary session,
which ends on June 18.
That task seemed almost insurmountable, however, because of the
parties' contradictory views of the war.
The focus of the resolution battle is the still highly charged issue
of whether the government should apologise for Japan's actions during
the Second World War or express only regret for having become caught up
in it.
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and other liberals support an
apology. Murayama has indirectly threatened to resign if a clear
statement of Japan's responsibility as the aggressor is not made in the
resolution.
However many Japanese conservatives believe Japan fought because it
had been forced into a corner by American and European economic
policies.
They also believe, as did many of Japan's soldiers, that the final
goal of the war was not Japanese expansionism but the liberation of Asia
from European colonialism.
0 In the past year, Japan has taken several steps toward easing
lingering suspicions of its Asian neighbours, including a #600m package
focusing on a wide array of ''friendship projects''.
However the government insists any direct compensation claims by
individuals were addressed in post-war treaties.--AP.

A WARRANT for the arrest of the Marquess of Blandford was issued
yesterday when he failed to appear at a London magistrates court on
driving offences.
Charged under the name of Mr Charles James Blandford, of Chelsea, he
is alleged to have overtaken on a zebra crossing while riding his
scooter in Cannon Street, central London, on January 7 last year. He is
also accused of having no helmet, no insurance, and no test certificate.
The Duke of Marlborough's 39-year-old heir had failed to attend an

THIS month, drivers are being urged to leave their cars at home for
one day in five in a bid to reduce air pollution -- increasingly seen as
a cause of asthma among children.
The ''Don't Choke Britain'' campaign is only one group to highlight
the increasing cost of asthma to society.
* Half of all admissions of children to hospitals are caused by
asthma.
* One in 10 children in the UK suffers from asthma -- double the rate
of 10 years ago.
* In 12 years the annual cost of treatment has risen from #50m to more
than #350m in prescription charges alone in the UK.
* Seven million working days a year are lost due to asthma.
* This accounts for losses of #400m in productivity, #70m in sickness
and invalidity benefit, and #473m to the NHS.
* Prescribing for asthma medicines has almost doubled over the past
decade.
* Each year 2000 people die as a result of asthma attacks, 80% of
which are avoidable.
* There are about three million people in the UK with active asthma,
700,000 of them under 16.
* In one school in Wales, 38% of schoolchildren in a recent study lost
an average of 10 days of education a year because of asthma.

MEMBERS of a religious sect in Scotland have banned their children
from using hi-tech equipment at school.
The secretive presbyterian group known as the Brethren, believe new
technology is stamped with the figures 666, the so-called devil's
number.
They have banned computers, televisions, videos, and even calculators
for mathematics classes.
Instead, traditional forms of learning such as book reading and direct
tuition are to be used.
Peterhead Academy and Oldmachar Academy, in Aberdeen, have both
received requests from parents not to let their children use hi-tech
equipment.
''When the families made the request to us, we pointed out the effects
this might have on the children,'' said Mr George Milne, headmaster at
Peterhead.
''The pupils involved do not seem to have suffered as two of them have
won prizes at the school.
''I would like to point out that they are very capable students but I
do believe the vast majority of children would be disadvantaged were
they to withdraw themselves from this type of technology.''
Mr Joseph Leiper, headmaster at Oldmachar Academy, said the sect's
demands made it difficult to teach the Scottish curriculum.
''It does cause difficulties because the new curriculum is so heavily
orientated towards new technology,'' he explained. ''But we just have to
try to accommodate these peoples' views and work for a sensible
compromise.''
According to Mr Jim Towers, Grampian Regional Council's deputy
education chairman and councillor for the area around Peterhead, the
Brethren's objections stem from the Bible's Book of Revelations.
''In Revelations, 666 is regarded as being associated with the devil
and that is one of the reasons given by parents for outlawing computers
and suchlike,'' he said.
The issue is to be debated at a Grampian Regional Council education
meeting today.
A spokesman for computer suppliers, Escom, said the notion that
computers and TVs had the numbers 666 stamped on them was nonsense. He
added: ''The whole idea is a total fantasy.''

Elizabeth Buie reports on competing claims about the real price to be
paid for alcohol consumption.
SO MUCH for the theory that an occasional drink, particularly if it is
a glass of red wine, will actually benefit your health by cutting down
the chances of heart disease.
The latest report to tackle the cost of alcohol to society attempts to
scotch that particular idea by suggesting that swallowing anti-oxidant
vitamins carries the same benefits in terms of coronary heart disease --
without the additional harms caused by alcohol.
In fact, few health or social issues tend to generate more argument
than the questions posed by alcohol consumption.
Is it all right to drink in moderation? What is moderation? Is a
little of what you like actually good for you? Will higher taxation cut
the social problems cause by alcohol abuse? Will tougher drink-driving
laws have a proportionate effect upon traffic accidents?
Eurocare, an alliance of 23 alcohol abuse agencies within the European
Union, takes a hardline policy on most of these questions in its report
published yesterday. One of its contributing members is the Institute of
Alcohol Studies, based in London, which, as the drinks industry takes
care to point out, receives part of its funding from the UK Temperance
Association. One of its consultants, David Jernigan, claims the
institute does not take a stance for or against temperance. Certainly,
however, its recommendations are among the most draconian published yet.
The main thrust of the report is to call upon the EU to take a much
tougher line on taxation and regulation of drinking in an attempt to cut
the social costs of alcohol consumption.
According to the report, across Europe one in 10 deaths, one in five
male hospital admissions, and one in five road traffic deaths are
alcohol related. Some two out of three violent criminals were under the
influence of alcohol at the time of their offence, it claims.
The good news for the UK is that in alcohol consumption, Britain comes
13th out of 15 (above Finland and Sweden), while Luxembourg comes top
(probably a distorted position as many people living in neighbouring
countries travel to Luxembourg to take advantage of its lower taxes on
alcoholic drinks) and France second.
As ever, statistics provoke nothing but argument and different
interpretations. Mr Jernigan, for the Institute of Alcohol Studies, said
most of the report's statistics had come from the World Health
Organisation (WHO); for his part, George Winstanley, director of
strategy for the Portman Group (the drinks industry's lobby group)
quoted the WHO's technical committee report on cardio-vascular disease
for his claim that moderate consumption of alcohol had beneficial
effects.
The Eurocare report, however, attempts to refute what it describes as
attempts by the drinks industry to ''promote alcohol as a kind of health
food''. It argues: ''There may be a reduced risk of death from coronary
heart disease from alcohol consumption in the middle-aged and elderly,
but it is not certain that this results in longer life expectancy''.
The report's authors also argue that it is the ingredients in
alcoholic beverages rather than the alcohol itself that may be, at least
partly, responsible for the apparent protective effect, and that any net
health benefit from alcohol is obtainable only from very low consumption
levels -- less than one drink per day on average -- and that above this
level any reduced risk of heart attack is offset by an increased risk of
other diseases, including cancer.
The bottom line, according to this report, is that more exercise,
stopping smoking, and taking anti-oxidant vitamins are more likely to
protect against heart disease than moderate consumption of alcohol.
However, Professor John Davies, director of Strathclyde University's
Addiction Research Group, claims that advocating the consumption of a
couple of vitamins instead of a little wine is ''a very silly
argument''.
''A couple of glasses of wine accompanying a meal is a very nice thing
to do. It goes along with Mozart, fine art, and so on. A couple of
glasses of New Zealand Chardonnay is a delight to the palate. People are
not interested in taking anti-oxidants instead of a couple of glasses of
wine,'' he said.
He argues that 90% of the population drink alcohol without causing
social problems. Of the small proportion of the population for whom
alcohol does have a social cost, the cause is ''alcohol plus something
else'', and that something else can be unemployment, poverty, or some
other source of stress.
''The middle-class view of legislation in Sweden is that it supports
these initiatives up until the point where it affects their own drinking
behaviour,'' said Prof Davies.
''People probably have a right to get themselves in a mess. It depends
on the kind of society that we want. If you want the kind of society
where your personal choice behaviour is controlled, then you can have it
but there will be consequences. But if you want the more open and free
liberal society that we seem to want, then there will be a price to
pay.''
The Institute of Alcohol Studies favours the former approach,
recommending that ''as it has not been proved that one type of alcoholic
beverage is 'safer' than any others, alcoholic beverages should be taxed
proportionately to the amount of alcohol they contain''.
Mr Jernigan said: ''Taxes on alcohol should at least be sufficient to
cover the social costs of alcohol problems. As long as wine goes untaxed
then society as a whole has to meet the costs of all the damage arising
from its consumption. The fundamental principle of alcohol taxation
should be that alcohol should at least pay its way.''
He added: ''The #2060m subsidy to French and Italian wine producers
and the Scotch whisky industry for export to Third World countries
should be removed unless they are for the purpose of reducing alcohol
consumption. These sums are hugely in excess of money spent by member
states on alcohol prevention programmes.''
A spokesman for the Scotch Whisky Association argued, however, that
the EU did not give a subsidy but a rebate to cereal producers in
Europe.
The idea of making alcohol tax a social welfare tax had been tried to
some extent in Scandinavia but had not worked, he claimed.
''It certainly penalises people who drink in moderation, but does not
help people who misuse the product -- they find other ways to get the
money, which may be out of the housekeeping or other ways,'' he added.
The Eurocare report also calls for a reduction across the UK to a
drink-drive limit of 20mgs of alcohol in 100mgs of blood -- four times
lower than the current UK level -- virtually a zero tolerance policy.
The Automobile Association's roads and environment officer for
Scotland, Neil Greig, argued that there has been a lot of success in
reducing drink-drive offences over the past 10 years, leaving a hard
core of people who tend to drink more than twice the legal limit and who
would not be affected by a greater reduction in the limit.
A lower level and an increase in random breath testing would simply
use up more police resources and time for more negative results, he
said.
Dr Richard Hammersley, of Glasgow University's behavioural sciences
group, favours a reduced limit on the grounds that people driving just
within the current limit can still have impaired judgment.
He also supports the report's recommendation that alcohol advertising
be much more strictly regulated, with financial penalties for
infringement.
But there is scepticism from both Dr Hammersley and Professor Davies
about suggestions that more resources should be put into educational
initiatives, mainly on the grounds that there is little evidence that
they work.
Dr Hammersley said: ''I think people are more aware that drinking is
not a free activity in the sense that you can do as much as you like,
but some of the groups who used to drink less, for example women, are
now drinking more. Working out the costs of drinking is very difficult.
It is not so difficult to work out as far as alcohol problems are
concerned, but the cost of things like lost productivity or feeling a
bit off form is more difficult -- it is too subtle a thing to get a
handle on.''
Professor Davies, who counts alcohol and nicotine as drugs and is also
in favour of the decriminalisation of heroin, argues: ''If you start
going down the path of criminalising alcohol or smoking, any possibility
that we have of getting any sensible policies on difficult drugs like
heroin or cocaine is going to go out the window.''

Washington, Monday
ACTOR Christopher Reeve today underwent 6[1/2] hours of surgery to
stabilise his neck to after breaking the top two vertebrae in a riding
accident nine days ago.
''Everything went well,'' said Dr John Jane, the chief physician. ''He
indicated pleasure when I told him this would enable us to move his head
up.''
He added that Mr Reeve had signalled he was eager to begin what is
likely to be months of intense rehabilitation. ''He's a wonderful
patient,'' said Dr Jane.
He said Mr Reeve might regain at least some movement in his upper
body, but that it was premature to speculate at this stage. He will
still need a respirator to breathe.
If all goes well, doctors will be able to prop Mr Reeve into a sitting
position. Dr Jones said that his patient was in excellent spirits.

MEDIA tycoon Robert Maxwell ordered a major restructuring of his
group's pension funds in 1988 by setting up a new company to take charge
of their investments, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday. At the same
time, he made sure only his nominees got on to the board.
Trustees from pension funds were excluded as possible directors, the
court was told.
However, directors did include his sons Kevin and Ian, currently
facing charges of plotting to defraud the pension funds out of assets
worth more than #120m.
The investment company was formed in the same year that Robert Maxwell
took over Mirror Group Newspapers.
Employees and pensioners of the Daily Record and the Sunday Mail had
their contributions caught up in the alleged illegal share dealings.
Initially, Robert Maxwell made sure he was the only person who could
buy or sell shares in the pension fund, the court was told by the first
witness at the Maxwell fraud trial.
Later, Mr Trevor Cook, the former pension fund adminstrator, said
Maxwell's son Kevin was given the same authority.
They bought or sold. Only when a deal was done did they then inform
the pension fund's investment company what had happened. Normally this
was in a telephone message.
In his opening address to the jury, Mr Alan Suckling, QC, had said
they might conclude this witness was not a very capable or competent
administrator of a pension fund.
Mr Kevin Maxwell, 36, his older brother Ian, 38, and two former
Maxwell financial advisers, Mr Robert Bunn, 47, and Mr Larry
Trachtenberg, 42, deny conspiring to defraud by misusing pension fund
shares valued at #25m in a bid to prop up the ailing Maxwell empire in
the days after the newspaper publisher's mysterious death.
Mr Kevin Maxwell alone is accused of plotting with his late father to
misuse pension fund shares valued at #100m.
Mr Cook described how, on the day following Robert Maxwell's
disappearance on November 5, 1991, he had to wait in a queue to see Mr
Kevin Maxwell to express his concerns over the pension funds shares that
are the subject of the charges.
Asked how he appeared, Mr Cook responded: ''Surprisingly resilient. He
looked very tired, very concerned, but he appeared to be on the ball.''
According to the witness, Mr Kevin Maxwell indicated one of his first
priorities would be to ensure the pension fund was sorted out. He
immediately offered to place group properties in the hands of the
pension funds to replace absent payments.
The court has heard this never happened.
Mr Cook conceded that by the end of November the company in charge of
pension fund investments was owed #296m by the Robert Maxwell Group.
Earlier, the court was told that Mr Ian Maxwell was a bit player
compared with all the other actors in the alleged conspiracy.
Counsel insisted that Mr Ian Maxwell found himself in the dock charged
with taking part in the alleged plot, not because of what he had done
but because of what he was -- a Maxwell and because he was his father's
son.
Mr Edmund Lawson, QC, representing Mr Ian Maxwell, said the
prosecution had had three and a half years to demonstrate his client's
dishonesty.
0 Throughout that long investigation, all they could come up with were
a few snippets and much of this resulted from events in the immediate
aftermath of Robert Maxwell's disappearance and death at sea.
Commercial chaos and personal trauma for the Maxwell family followed
the death of the gargantuan publishing tycoon, he told the jury.
For his sons, there were thousands of tasks to be undertaken.
''In Ian Maxwell's case, one of the most important was nothing to do
with money -- he was making arrangements for his own father's funeral.''
Mr Lawson said Mr Ian Maxwell was not a financier and had taken little
part in the financial decisions of the group until after his father's
death.
Although a director of 200 Maxwell companies, Mr Ian Maxwell was
answerable to his father, who at all times instructed him in what he
must do and expected a full report back on what he had done.
References had been made during the trial to Robert Maxwell's
personality, counsel said.
Mr Ian Maxwell had a peculiar insight into his father's nature.
''He had the experience of being sacked by his dad for the heinous
offence of failing to turn up at an airport to collect Robert Maxwell,''
Mr Lawson declared.
The trial continues.

A BIGAMIST escaped a prison sentence yesterday when a sheriff heard
that he was to marry a woman he deceived.
William Sandford, 27, bigamously wed Invergordon woman Eleanor
McLelland in June last year while still married to Mrs Sonya Sandford,
of Consett, County Durham.
However, Inverness Sheriff Court was told that Ms McLelland was
sticking by Sandford and the couple were now planning a legal marriage.
Sandford moved in with Ms McLelland at Inverbreakie Drive,
Invergordon, after the illegal wedding.
He admitted bigamously marrying her on June 24 last year at Inverness
register office.
His agent, Mr Jack Gowans, told the court: ''She (Ms McLelland) has
decided to stick by him and go through a proper marriage when he gets a
divorce.''
Sheriff Donald Booker-Milburn said: ''I would have treated this matter
very seriously indeed if the person you deceived was not willing to
stick by you. It makes a huge difference to the sentence.''
He ordered Sandford, who has three previous convictions, to carry out
100 hours' community service.
Before Sandford married Mrs Sonya Sandford, he had begged her to
divorce her estranged first husband. The offence took place only three
months after she had married Sandford.
Sandford told his wife that he was going to Scotland to find work and
returned just twice to visit her at their council house in Castledene
Road, Consett, County Durham.
While he was away, news filtered back to Mrs Sandford that the accused
had married another woman.
Mrs Sandford said last year: ''I went berserk and smashed the house up
when I heard. To think I divorced my first husband Billy for him.''
Sandford would not comment as he left court yesterday.

A YOUTH was ordered to be detained in a Young Offenders' Institution
for three years yesterday for attacking a cafe owner he claimed had
short-changed him.
Gerald Donnelly, 16, admitted assaulting and attempting to rob Mr
Carmine D'Alessandro in Main Street, Alexandria, Dunbartonshire, last
year.
Advocate-depute, Mr Paul McBride, prosecuting, said Donnelly, of Munro
Street, Alexandria, fired an air pistol at his victim, after demanding:
''Give me the money or I'll shoot.''
Mr McBride told the High Court in Glasgow: ''The shop keeper shielded
himself with a cash box and the air pellet missed. During a struggle,
the cafe owner was hit across the head and had to have five stitches
inserted in a wound..''
Defence advocate, Mr Samuel Galbraith, said Donnelly drank vodka for
the first time before attacking Mr D'Alessandro.
He added: ''He claimed his victim had given him change of #1 instead
of #5 two weeks earlier.''
A neighbour witnessed the assault and caught Donnelly after a chase.
Donnelly, who had no previous convictions, admitted threatening,
kicking, and shooting at his victim and attempting to rob him.
His plea of not guilty to pistol-whipping his victim was accepted by
the Crown.

BRITISH Gas was accused yesterday of sending its workers an ''arrogant
and insensitive'' memo about the outcome of last week's stormy
shareholders' meeting.
The memo, headed ''employee briefing'', gives details of the proxy
votes from leading institutions which helped secure the reappointment of
chief executive Cedric Brown, who was the subject of controversy over
his 75% pay rise.
A majority of the 4300 shareholders at the meeting in London voted
against Mr Brown's re-appointment and heavily in favour of setting up a
new advisory group to consider executive pay.
However, as the briefing points out, Mr Brown won 97.7% of the votes
when all the proxy votes were counted. The advisory group motion was
defeated by 89%.
Mr Dave Stirzaker, head of gas for Unison, said: ''This briefing is
symptomatic of the arrogance and insensitivity of British Gas
management.
''After achieving corporate history last Wednesday, after alienating
small shareholders, it now crows over its victory and pours salt on the
already sore wounds of workers.
''Unison members are not idiots, they know what happened at the AGM so
this sort of briefing is an insult.''
The three-page briefing paper issued by the company's corporate
affairs department includes a passage from Mr Brown which reads: ''I
would like to thank shareholders for their overwhelming support -- 97.7%
of the vote is most gratifying.''
A British Gas spokeswoman confirmed the memo had been sent but denied
the company was ''crowing'' about the outcome of the AGM.
''We were just putting the record straight and giving workers factual
clarification of what happened.
''There was a great deal of interest in the outcome of the meeting and
we wanted to put our employees in the picture,'' she said.

LORD Wilson will be buried today in a beachside graveyard on the Isles
of Scilly.
The body of the former Prime Minister arrived on St Mary's by
helicopter from London yesterday.
It was met by a guard of honour of local firemen who acted as bearers,
taking the coffin to the hearse.
The party was given a police escort to the nineteenth century Church
of St Mary the Virgin where the funeral service will be conducted this
afternoon.
At the church, the coffin was met by another guard of honour, members
of the local lifeboat crew.
Inside the church, the Rev Michael Phillips, rector and chaplain of
the Isles of Scilly, said prayers in the presence of Lady Wilson, Lady
Falkender, his former political secretary, and Mrs Peggy Field, Lady
Falkender's sister.
The family has picked a plot in the graveyard of a 900-year-old church
also called the Church of St Mary the Virgin, half a mile away, where
Lord Wilson used to attend evening services. The funeral service will be
held in the newer church because the older one can seat only 64.
Mr Phillips said: ''Lady Wilson was most concerned that the delegation
from London should be small and without spouses or partners to enable
the maximum room to be available for the people of the islands.''
Lord Wilson was a much-loved figure on the Isles of Scilly. He and his
family visited the islands at every possible opportunity for many years.
He died last month just a few days after leaving his holiday bungalow,
Lowenva, at St Mary's.
0 Political figures expected to attend today include Labour leader
Tony Blair; former Labour Premier Lord Callaghan; and Lady Castle, a
principal member of his Cabinets.
The Prime Minister will be represented by Mr David Harris, Tory MP for
St Ives, a constituency which includes the Isles of Scilly.

<TEXT>
A DRIVE to re-establish sport as ''one of the great pillars of
education'', placing it at the heart of school life, was announced
yesterday by Mr John Major.
The Prime Minister called for a ''sea change'' to reverse the trend
which had seen sport relegated to a single subject in the curriculum,
although he admitted the changes would have to take place ''over time''.
Speaking at a lunch in London in aid of the sports-medical research
charity Sparks, he said the Government would set out detailed proposals
in a forthcoming policy paper.
The new strategy would include measures to strengthen links between
schools and sports clubs and a new deal for ''elite sport'' as well as
plans to boost sport in schools.
In particular, it would ensure the ''great traditional sports'', such
as cricket, hockey, swimming, athletics, football, netball, rugby, and
tennis, were put centre stage in school life.
''I can't readily accept a situation in which most 14-year-olds are
offered only an hour and a half a week of physical exercise in our
schools, while surveys tell us they spend a day and a half a week
watching television,'' he said.
''I want to put sport back at the heart of weekly life in every
school. To re-establish sport as one of the great pillars of education
alongside the academic, the vocational, and the moral.
''It should never have been relegated by the educational theorists to
be just one part of one subject in the curriculum. But it has and, over
time, that must be reversed.''
Mr Major, whose personal enthusiasm for sport and for cricket in
particular is well-known, said the Government's proposals would
encourage schools to match their sporting provision against the best.
He also wanted to see schools and sports clubs develop links in order
to give better access to high-quality coaching and to promote
arrangements to share equipment and facilities.
''Our policy plans will reassert our commitment to competitive and
team sport in school and beyond school,'' he said.
The new deal for elite sport would, he said, be aimed at producing
fully developed programmes of talent spotting and support to enable
leading British sportsmen and women to compete against the best in the
world.
He said he expected the #300m a year that the National Lottery -- once
in full flow -- would provide for sport would revolutionise it in the
years ahead.
However, he also indicated that the Government would seek involvement
from the business sector in supporting the proposals.

SCOTTISH newspapers can either become cheap local papers to combat the
threat from cut-price, London-based titles flooding the market, or they
can pursue a more ambitious and expensive agenda, according to Mr Arnold
Kemp, former editor of The Herald.
Mr Kemp, who is delivering the Alexander Stone Lecture in Bibliophily
at Glasgow University tonight, will argue that the ambitious route is a
more demanding option -- but the only one worth having.
He will also state that as far as the Scottish press is concerned,
there is no need for further Government regulation. ''It would be unfair
if, because of the perceived sins of London papers, its legitimate tasks
were to be further hampered by new legislation on privacy.''
On the issue of newspaper ownership, Mr Kemp believes serious Scottish
papers should not be driven primarily by profit and should instead be
administered by trusts such as those that run the Irish Times and the
Guardian.
The lecture, at the Boyd Orr Lecture Theatre at 6.30pm, will be open
to the public.

EXPLORATORY talks aimed at resolving the pay dispute involving around
900,000 NHS employees have been arranged for next week.
They will involve all NHS unions and organisations except the non-TUC
Royal College of Nursing, which is seeking separate negotiations with
the NHS executive.
Pressure increased yesterday for industrial action should these talks
fail, with the General, Municipal, and Boilermakers union setting a
timetable for balloting its 30,000 NHS members who include ambulance
workers and controllers, nurses and ancillary grades.
Mr Mick Fisher, the GMB national officer for health, condemned the
Government's 1% pay offer and the possibility of further small increases
to be negotiated locally.
He fully expected GMB members to vote for industrial action short of
strike action in support of the retention of central bargaining and
admitted that, while patients would not be put at risk, they would be
inconvenienced.
Ballot papers would go out early next month and the result is expected
a month later -- broadly in line with the timetable agreed with the
other unions, the largest of which, Unison, is to ballot from July 5.

LONGER working hours, increased travel times, and the rising number of
women with jobs are leaving Britons with less free time on their hands,
new research shows today.
Almost nine in 10 women complain they never have enough time to get
things done, while six in 10 of the population suffer stress.
Nearly half of British workers come home exhausted and 25% of men work
more than 48 hours a week.
A picture of the nationwide squeeze on time comes from the Henley
Research Centre. Under-25s spend 25% less time reading newspapers than
they did 10 years ago, preferring to use personal computers or surf
television channels.
The study, published by left-wing think-tank Demos, reveals a widening
gulf between the jobs people do and what they want.
Asked to describe their ideal job, parallel research published
elsewhere in the report shows almost four in 10 would like to reduce
their working week without harming their careers.
One in three would leap at the chance of taking unpaid leave for a
year, 25% favour a four-day week, and 27% work partly at home.
Concerns about job security mean few are optimistic about the changing
work environment. The study claims part of the problem is a failure of
leadership, illustrated by a growing distrust of managers.
Almost seven in 10 say business does not strike a fair balance between
profits and the public interest, according to data from Mori.
The findings prompted the think tank to call for new measures to make
it easier for people to shape time according to their needs.
Among its proposals are caring leave sabbaticals, new financing
arrangements for parental leave, and the opening of schools, surgeries,
and other services at night and weekends.

A COMPUTER company, described yesterday by Scottish Secretary Ian Lang
as ''a breakthrough for Scottish industry'', has been forced to look
abroad for nearly half of the workforce at its new information
technology centre.
Mr Lang, opening McQueen Ltd's European Call Centre at Calder House,
Pentland Gait, Edinburgh, said the #3m facility reinforced Scotland's
position at the leading edge of development in the fast-growing computer
software sector.
Computer specialists, speaking 12 languages, would deal with more than
one million calls in the first year of the centre's operation, working
for clients who included the world's biggest computer software
publishers.
However, McQueen Ltd, which provides direct sales and technical
support to European customers, has employed 80 of its 200 staff at the
facility from abroad.
Requirements to work in specialist European sections within the firm
are thought to have included a good knowledge of languages such as
Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish.
A spokesman for the Scottish Office said: ''Generally speaking,
Scotland can provide the vast majority of skills required. We recognise
in certain areas there is a need for both hi-tech knowledge and native
fluency; requirements which are not always met in the British
population.''
The firm, founded as a printing company 150 years ago, had a projected
turnover of #25m this year. It had 65 staff in 1986, and now employed
450.
The chairman and chief executive, Mr Mike Gray, said: ''We were always
set on achieving a balance. We are very happy to have achieved that
balance and attracted people with the skills we have in Edinburgh.''

RELATIVES caring for people with dementia are at breaking point
because they cannot get respite care, a report claimed yesterday.
Alzheimer Scotland-Action on Dementia, launching Dementia Awareness
Week, urged health boards and local authorities to increase the number
of breaks for the carers of Scotland's 28,000 dementia sufferers who
live at home.
The group wants all those who care for 20 hours a week or more to have
a minimum of two weeks' respite care a year, plus four hours each week.
''We need a range of services in every district, to allow for regular
short breaks, day and night-time respite, holidays, and emergencies,''
said Mr Jim Jackson, the organisation's executive director.
It is estimated that about 80% of people with dementia live at home,
the majority aged over 65 and half over 80. However, there are thought
to be about 2000 people in Scotland between 40 and 65 with dementia.
Mr John Watson, 55, was a partner in a removal firm when he developed
the first signs of Alzheimer's four years ago.
His wife, Brenda, recalled yesterday: ''He kept asking me to set the
alarm clock every night for him. I got exasperated one night and asked
why he didn't do it himself. He said: 'I can't do it, Brenda.' I thought
it was a breakdown -- the stress of running the business.''
The business went and the Edinburgh couple, once reasonably well-off,
found themselves living on #100 a week.
Mr Watson looks fitter and healthier than ever -- he had lost weight
under the strain of the business -- but his mind has deteriorated.
Frequent small strokes -- sometimes as many as three a day -- have
hastened the decline.
Once, they won medals for dancing. Now, Mrs Watson cannot take him to
a dance unless they have friends, in case he wanders off, sits at the
wrong table or gets into someone else's taxi.
What Mrs Watson yearns for most is time, particularly time for her
daughters Julie, 21, and Dionne, 13.
Her only break over the years has been the few hours, three days a
week, when her husband attends the Inverleith Centre, and on a Saturday
when a friend drops by to let her out shopping.
When she enquired about residential respite care, she was told it
would cost #112 a week. ''That would have left me #39 a week to live on
from my income support. I had to turn it down.''
The report said that three regions means-tested for residential
respite care, so that people who had savings above #8000 had to pay as
much as #345 a week in Grampian, #180 in the Borders, and #280 in
Lothian, whereas other regions had maintained a flat rate of about #50 a
week.
Borders said its ceiling was #150 a week. Ms Diane Savage, assistant
director of finance and administration, said: ''There are very few
actually paying the full amount. We have a view that people should be
charged according to their ability to pay. The #8000 would not include
the patient's home, if they own one -- that is clearly not a realisable
asset if they are going back to it.''
A spokesman for Grampian said: ''If someone is paying #345 a week,
that must refer to a private nursing home. The charges for our own
facilities are about #280, as for residential care. We means-test in
accordance with the Government guidelines.''
The Scottish Office said local authorities providing or paying for
residential respite care were not obliged to adhere to the means-testing
scale set out for full-time residential care, which rises on a sliding
scale for savings above #3000 until the full amount is payable if
savings exceed #8000.
Labour MP Rachel Squire, who is tabling an early-day motion in
Parliament tomorrow in support of the report, said: ''It has been
estimated that carers who are caring for more than 20 hours a week are
saving the country up to #38 billion a year if you reckon the cost of
looking after these patients would be #5-#10 an hour.''

YOUNGSTERS crippled with arthritis may be able to look forward to a
pain-free life, scientists claimed yesterday.
Changes in the treatment of the disease, which affects the joints,
mean some will be able to grow without deformity.
Others who suffer from complications may be helped by a promising new
drug, said a report from the Arthritis and Rheumatism Council.
It charts the great strides made in the treatment of childhood
arthritis, which affects more than 14,000 nationwide.
Its author, Dr Taunton Southwood, senior lecturer in paediatric
rheumatology at the University of Birmingham, said there was now a
greater understanding about various drugs and the use of a team approach
in treatment.
This involved physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses,
psychologists, social workers, and splint makers, as well as expert
medical staff.
Dr Southwood said: ''In children who have only a few affected joints
and are otherwise healthy, there is a good chance the child will be free
of active arthritis after a few years.
''However, if many joints are affected, or the child has additional
problems with fever, rash, and the heart, the outlook is not as good. As
many as half of these patients have active arthritis in adulthood and
some may even require joint replacement surgery.''
To help prevent the problems, the council is funding research into a
drug called Methotrexate which has been shown to benefit patients with
more severe forms of arthritis.
Other research is also being carried out to investigate genetic and
environmental factors in the disease.

DEVOLUTION for Scotland will not cause turmoil and will instead bring
decisions closer to the people, particularly those in the business
community, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson saidyesterday.
Speaking at an Institute of Directors lunch in Edinburgh, he urged
business leaders not to rely on the ''tainted judgment'' of a Government
vainly trying to discredit devolution but to look at the success of
decentralisation in Spain, Belgium, and Germany.
The institute gave a cautious welcome to his remarks, several members
insisting that more detail was needed. Director Donald Hardie said
businessmen in Scotland still faced difficulties in seeing how the
economy could be controlled from a ''mini-centre''.
Mr Robertson launched an attack on what he called Government
propaganda on devolution for Scotland which could affect investment.
It was time, he said, for Scottish Secretary Ian Lang to put aside
partisan point-scoring for the country's benefit.
''Surely he can recognise that the old, crude hostility to devolution
among the business community has been replaced by a much more pragmatic
approach.
''Nobody is now interested in, frankly, sloganised exaggeration on the
effects of democratic decentralisation. They want information and a
factual analysis,'' he said.
Accepting that a Scottish parliament would not have powers to alter
corporate taxation or change the financial services regime, he said
there would be no alteration in the formula for public expenditure in
Scotland.
Revenue-raising and tax-cutting powers would be used only if the
Scottish administration was given a mandate to do so.
Mr Robertson added that with the Scottish Office already in place, it
was obvious that no new tier of bureaucracy had to be created.
Referring to decentralisation in Europe, he said business leaders
should look to the rise of Catalonia, one of the ancient nations of
Europe and the most prosperous part of Spain.
Said Mr Robertson: ''Spain is the best advert for what they call 'home
rule', and the emphatic answer to the increasingly unconvincing
resistance to decentralisation in Britain.''
He recalled that its ''very conservative'' president, along with his
industry minister, had recently visited Scotland and were extremely
enthusiastic about the benefits their autonomous region now enjoyed.
Mr Robertson said: ''Scottish business and industry have nothing to
lose in the creation of a Scottish parliament -- and, in the new
excitement about devolution inside the UK, will have much to gain.
''The whole thrust of the devolved parliament will be to boost and
encourage Scottish business.''
Asked from the floor whether devolution would lead ultimately to
independence, Mr Robertson countered that it would end the call.
Questioned about the establishment of a federal system on the lines of
Brussels, he said: ''I believe taking decisions closer to the people is
vital. We are becoming closer to Europe, and Brussels and Westminster
will always have their parts to play. Unless you change and adapt, you
die and that applies to companies as well.''
Asked about the future of inward investment by Mr John Wilson of the
Stirling-based company Tannson, Mr Robertson said Belgium had already
proved a magnet, despite the fact that three regions made up the state.
Mr Donald Hardie, the institute director, agreed there could not be
hostility so far as business in Scotland was concerned. He said: ''I
would have liked to have heard exactly how Scottish business would
benefit. It is hard to see how the problem of the economy could be
controlled from a mini-centre. The composition of a devolved House could
favour a majority not in favour of private enterprise.''
Meanwhile, Mr Fergus Ewing, SNP business spokesman, said Mr
Robertson's proposals were for a ''pocket-money parliament'' that
treated Scotland as a child.
''The assembly favoured by Mr Robertson would have no powers to help
Scottish business,'' he said. ''It could not, for example, help the
whisky industry by cutting excise duty, boost road investment by an
independent direct voice in Europe, and it would not have the power to
attract more inward investment by cutting corporate taxation.''

THE UK's first television commercial for spirits is likely to be
screened soon. It is understood that, so far, six companies, covering a
wide range of spirits, have prepared and submitted scripts for vetting
to the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre.
Advertisements for spirits have not appeared on independent television
since it started in the 1950s. At the time, liquor companies entered a
voluntary agreement not to advertise them.
Liqueurs, lagers, and beers are promoted at present and, recently,
there has been increasing pressure from some companies to have torn up
the ''gentleman's agreement'', adopted as a matter of convention but not
law.
Last week, the way was cleared for the companies to promote their
brands on television.
A prime mover was Guinness-owned United Distillers. Marketing heads at
the company's Perth offices said it was not prepared to discuss plans
for advertising its individual brands.
However, according to industry sources in Scotland, it appears that
scripts for a commercial promoting its Bell's whisky have been prepared
and submitted to BACC.
A spokesman for the BACC -- who would not disclose the identities of
the companies who had submitted scripts -- said June 1 was the date the
voluntary agreement officially had been torn up.
''It was picked as a date to give sufficient notice to the industry,''
he said.
A spokeswoman in Glasgow for the ITC said it would be monitoring the
situation very carefully.

<HEADLINE>Advocate acquitted of growing cannabis in Perthshire home after wife admits offence. Drugs charge is not proven</HEADLINE>

AN advocate was acquitted yesterday of being involved in his wife's
cannabis-growing operation at the couple's isolated Perthshire home.
After a three-day trial, the jury at the High Court in Edinburgh took
just 45 minutes to return a majority not proven verdict in favour of Mr
Keith Henderson, 49.
His wife, Rosalind, 44, has admitted producing cannabis in the family
home at Brae of Monzie, near Crieff, and will be sentenced on June 19.
Mr Henderson shook with relief as the jury foreman announced the
verdict, which means he can resume his legal career. He has been unable
to practise as an advocate since his arrest last May. As he left court,
Mr Henderson declined to comment on the case.
He had denied producing cannabis at his home at Brae of Monzie between
February 17, 1993, and May 31 last year. At the end of the Crown case,
his wife pled guilty to producing the drug in a locked room at the house
over the same period.
Mr Henderson, who has previously appeared in High Court trials both as
a defence counsel and as a Crown junior assisting the prosecution, went
into the witness box to tell the jury that he knew of his wife's
cannabis growing operation but had strongly expressed his disapproval to
her.
The father of three, who has been at the Bar for 22 years, explained
that if he had tried to get rid of the cannabis it would have placed
''desperate strains'' on his marriage.
He added: ''I didn't like it at all and I made Rosalind aware of it. I
made it clear on many occasions that I didn't want anything to do with
it. I suppose I could have thrown them all out of the window. I am
pretty sure that would have caused desperate strains on the marriage.''
Mrs Henderson told the court that she smoked the drug up to 10 times a
day and that she had used cannabis, which she preferred to alcohol, for
about 18 years. Mrs Henderson said her husband did not like using the
drug.
Asked about the cannabis-growing operation at her home, Mrs Henderson
replied: ''It's mine entirely. My husband had nothing to do with it at
all.''
The scheme was uncovered when drug squad detectives raided the
Hendersons' home at 6am on May 31. Mrs Henderson was on holiday but when
Mr Henderson was asked about a locked room he told officers: ''There are
plants in there. You will get the key under the carpet.''
Police found 13 mature cannabis plants being grown with a soil-less
system using powerful horticultural lamps. A propagating tray with 77
spaces for seedlings, most of which contained a cannabis plant seedling,
and other potted-up seeds and seedlings were found in a greenhouse.
The Crown conceded it had to prove direct participation on Mr
Henderson's part -- in other words, that both he and his wife ''were in
it together''.
Mr Robert Henderson, QC, defending, said his client knew perfectly
well what his wife was up to but it was a ''massive leap'' to prove
beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Henderson was actively involved in the
production of cannabis.
Temporary judge Robin McEwan, QC, told the jury: ''Unless you can find
that both of them were in it together, there is no substantial evidence
against Keith Henderson on his own.
''She has said in clear and unmistakable terms that the operation was
hers and hers alone and had nothing to do with him. It did seem that she
was unrepentant about what she was doing and did not seem to care what
effect it had on his career.''

THE future of the Scottish Avalanche Information Service (SAIS) --
which has helped to reduce the number of accidents on Scotland's
mountains since its introduction more than six years ago -- is secure,
according to the Government.
Sir Hector Monro, Minister for Sport at the Scottish Office, yesterday
dismissed suggestions that the service, which receives #70,000 a year
from the Scottish Office, might be axed or face a reduction in funding.
Announcing the appointment of a chairman of the review group to look
at the delivery of the SAIS, he said: ''I want to make it crystal clear
that the continuation and future funding of the avalanche service is not
under threat. I am aware that there has been some uninformed speculation
in the media that this scheme may cease operations following the outcome
of the review. This is totally wrong.''
The Minister's comments were immediately welcomed by the co-ordinator
of the SAIS, Mr Blyth Wright, who said it would not be possible to
maintain the level of service in Scotland's most popular climbing areas
if funding were reduced.
Mr Hamish MacInnes, an international adviser on mountain rescue, who
was instrumental in securing funding for the service, is convinced there
has been a reduction in accidents since its introduction.
The SAIS, based at Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore, was introduced as a
pilot scheme in 1988-89 and fully established two years later.
It provides daily reports and forecasts of avalanche conditions
through the media and at mountain resorts from mid-December to mid-April
in the Lochaber, Glencoe, and northern Cairngorms areas.
The review of the service is expected to discuss the possibility of
extending it to other climbing areas, such as Torridon and Lochnagar.
The SAIS admitted in January that it did not have sufficient funds to
provide reports on Torridon, in the north-west Highlands, where a
climber was killed after being swept 1200ft in an avalanche.
The most recent figures available show that, up until about two
winters ago: more than 29% of avalanche accidents were in Lochaber,
mainly on the Ben Nevis massif; 24.5% were on Cairngorm; 17% in Glencoe;
and 8.2% on Lochnagar.
The SAIS is also considering alternative sources of funding such as
commercial sponsorship from large firms and financial institutions.
The chairman of the review group was named yesterday as Mr Andrew
Gibb, a solicitor and former president of the Law Society of Scotland.
A total of 28 people have died on Scottish mountains and hills so far
this year.

A MOTHER, grieving for her six-year-old son who died of meningitis,
spoke yesterday of her hopes that her daughter would win the fight for
life against the same disease.
Two-year-old Candy Summers, diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis
last Wednesday, was said to be ''critical but stable'' in Addenbrooke's
Hospital, Cambridge.
Her brother, Justin, died in April of hib meningitis, an unrelated
strain of the disease.
Candy's mother, Mrs Julie Summers, of West Newton, Norfolk, was at her
hospital bedside.
In a statement issued by the hospital, she said: ''Although Candy is
still critically ill, she is now stable and making slow but steady
progress.
''She had a comfortable night and I feel more hopeful that she will
recover. Every hour, she seems to be getting a little stronger and I
can't wait to give her that first cuddle.
''I know that Candy is in excellent hands and I'm so grateful to all
the staff in the paediatric intensive care unit at Addenbrooke's, who
have worked so hard to give Candy a chance.''
In the statement, she also said she was ''overwhelmed'' by the media
attention Candy's case had attracted and felt she must thank everyone
for their support.
''I feel very strongly that every parent should know the dangers of
this awful illness which strikes so suddenly and without warning,'' she
added.
Doctors said it was a cruel coincidence the brain disease had twice
struck the same family.
Mrs Summers said she had yet to come to terms with the swiftness of
Justin's death.
''If anyone can learn from my experience, it is that you have got to
act fast,'' she added.
Justin had been to the doctor with a chest infection and was keeping
warm next to her in bed, she told the paper.
''I must have drifted off to sleep. I woke up at 6am and Justin was
lying next to me but his eyes were staring wide open.
''He was completely still. I tried rousing him and calling his name
but deep down I had known at once he was brain dead.''
Justin's life-support system was switched off in hospital two days
later.
Mrs Summers and her husband, Paul, have separated since Justin's
death. They have two other children, Aarron, seven, and Fern, four.
''I am going to sit here, pray she will pull through, and not let
anything else enter my mind until there is light at the end of the
tunnel,'' she said.
Friends and neighbours have joined Candy's parents during their
bedside vigil.
Dr Jennifer Aickin, consultant in communicable disease control for
North West Anglia Health Commission, said there was no link between the
two cases. She said family contacts had been treated with antibiotics
and ''the chance of contracting the disease is very small''.

SCOTTISH Secretary Ian Lang last night said he had no intention of
resigning over the latest political row surrounding the public funding
of the Health Care International private hospital in Clydebank.
Mr Lang responded to critics after a statement made by the hospital's
receivers on Friday that the project was flawed from the beginning.
Although it emerged the taxpayer is owed at least #27m, Mr Lang
dismissed the notion it was a personal matter or that he should resign.
He said the project had been a limited success. The original company
had failed but the project was still there and providing employment in
an area where it was badly needed.
His comments came after a report by the receivers, the accountancy
firm, Arthur Andersen, to a creditors' meeting, that the hospital had
lost #21m in the six months up to March 1994 and in the following six
months a further #18.8m.
Losses for the banks, shareholders, creditors, and the Government
apparently total #120m.
Earlier, the Scottish Office issued a statement saying the receivers'
report was a matter for the company's creditors. It added that the
position was unchanged since the Scottish Secretary announced details of
the assistance provided to HCI after the receivers were called in in
November.
''Overall public assistance provided remains as detailed then --
around #27m -- and the outstanding balance of Regional Selective
Assistance grant remains unpaid pending the achievement of the agreed
jobs target.''
The receivers' report had prompted an avalanche of political criticism
and SNP leader Alex Salmond said Mr Lang had earlier stated HCI's losses
totalled #15m, a gross miscalculation: ''To lose millions of pounds of
public money through speculation is bad enough but not to know how much
has been lost is indefensible.''
The Scottish Secretary was accused by the Scottish Liberal Democrats'
leader, Mr Jim Wallace, of juggling the figures. He said the
Government's love of private medicine has blinded it to the obvious
financial shortcomings of the project, in particular where patients were
coming from.
Yesterday, an HCI spokeswoman said the hospital was reluctant to
comment on events which had happened before the receivers were called
in.

<HEADLINE>Doctor 'lied over wonder pregnancy treatment'</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978026728</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A LEADING gynaecologist fooled colleagues with bogus claims for a
wonder pregnancy treatment, the General Medical Council heard yesterday.
Dr John Pearce, 45, a senior consultant at St George's Hospital,
Tooting, south London, ''spun a web of deceit'' to hide his lies about
relocating ectopic embryos into the womb, it was claimed.
Barrister Rosalind Foster told the council's professional conduct
committee that Dr Pearce, of Tooting Bec, wrote papers about his claims
and had articles published in the British Journal of Obstetrics and
Gynaecology.
At the heart of the case were his claims to have relocated an ectopic
pregnancy (when the foetus is inside a fallopian tube) at five weeks'
gestation to patient Mrs Y and had made false claims that he had
received ethical committee approval for trials of the treatment.
Other doctors, ''to their shame,'' would state that they had been
fooled by Dr Pearce about the ''tests'' and operations in early 1994,
said Miss Foster.
''Dr Pearce spun a web of deceit to conceal his scientific fraud. He
then falsified records and research to cover up his lies.
''By his actions he has abused the trust of the public and the
profession.''
Miss Foster said Dr Pearce, a father of four, told a colleague he had
successfully relocated an embryo into patient Mrs Y and in March or
April 1994 he informed the doctor that a baby had successfully been
delivered -- and invited him to assist in a case report about the
''pioneering'' treatment.
He also provided another doctor at the hospital with handwritten notes
describing so-called trials of pregnancy treatment on 191 women and
instructed him to make amendments, which he then had incorporated into a
draft paper for the Journal after its initital rejection.
Dr Pearce is not attending the hearing, expected to last up to four
days, but Miss Foster said a letter from his solicitors denied
misconduct.
The doctor admits writing a false and misleading case report about the
alleged operation on Mrs Y and making untrue claims about the trials.
He denies other charges involving falsification of case reports and
failing to carry out successful ectopic replacement operations.
Miss Foster said the doctor was adamant that he had performed such
operations.
Dr Pearce held out false hope to women who had suffered recurring
miscarriages by claiming to have conducted pioneering research to
improve the likelihood of successful pregnancy, said Miss Foster.
But, in fact, there was ''irresistible'' evidence to suggest that the
trial never took place.
Even the doctor admitted the ''trial'', said to involve 191 women
during a three-year period to 1993, had not taken place in the way he
claimed in a report in the Journal.
''The council's case is that, first and foremost, this trial did not
take place at all,'' said Miss Foster.
Not a single doctor involved in this field knew anything about it and
experts became suspicious when they noticed the apparent similarity
between Dr Pearce's trial and another similar exercise undertaken in
Liverpool at roughly the same time.
Dr Pearce's report described a ''double blind, prospective, randomised
control trial'' involving the injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin
(hCG) and a placebo.
The hearing was adjourned until today.

<TEXT>
EDINBURGH University court last night granted a one-year reprieve to
the university's Centre of Human Ecology, which had been threatened with
closure at the end of the current session.
Members agreed to overturn a recommendation by the university's
central management group, a proposal which had provoked criticism from
leading environmentalists, including David Bellamy, Jonathon Porritt,
and Sara Parkin.
The move to close the centre had also been opposed by more than 600
students and a large number of environmental organisations in Scotland.
The centre was founded more than 20 years ago and is regarded as
having helped pioneer environmental studies in Scotland. It has achieved
an international reputation for its teaching and research work.
However, it is regarded by some university figures as overly radical.
Its staff have been associated closely with such causes as community
ownership for the island of Eigg, and the campaign against the Lingerbay
superquarry in Harris.
Last month, university officials said the planned closure was a result
of the financial pressure on higher education and the fact that
Edinburgh had expanded environmental-related studies across the
spectrum.
After last night's court meeting, a university spokesman confirmed
that the centre would remain open for the next 12 months, pending the
results of a comprehensive review of its operation.
Full funding would be provided meantime and a decision on its
long-term future was expected before the end of this year.
The spokesman said further discussions would be held over the future
of the centre's two part-time academic staff, whose contracts were due
to finish in September.

<TEXT>
A 72-YEAR-OLD child molester was sent to the High Court for sentence
yesterday. John Livingstone had pleaded guilty to ''an enormous
catalogue'' of serious sexual offences, stretching back 44 years.
Livingstone, a former shipyard worker, of Napier Terrace, Govan,
Glasgow, was told by Sheriff Kenneth Mitchell: ''Your conduct over many
years has been totally deplorable, and the effect on your victims is
incalculable. A prison sentence is inevitable.''
Livingstone pleaded guilty at Glasgow Sheriff Court to six charges of
committing a variety of indecent offences against three girls and three
boys over many years going back to 1951.
The Crown accepted his pleas of not guilty to three similar charges,
and a charge of having sex with another girl.
Livingstone had been retired for years before the parents of one girl
went to the police. He at first denied the allegations but pleaded
guilty when the case came to court. The offences took place in various
houses in Glasgow.
Defending, advocate Miss Ruth Anderson said Livingstone had been
ostracised by his family since being charged. His wife, who was
housebound, was now living alone, and Miss Anderson urged the sheriff to
put Livingstone on probation so that he could look after her.
Livingstone had worked all his life in the shipyards, apart from war
service with the Army, and many of the offences were years old. ''He is
at the end of his life and he has had to give an account of his
behaviour,'' she said.
Sheriff Mitchell told Livingstone that the three years' maximum
imprisonment he could impose was inadequate, and sent him to the High
Court for sentence.

DOCTORS' leaders may make a legal challenge against the National
Lottery over what they claim is a decision not to give cash to medical
research charities -- a charge the lottery board denies strongly.
Growing concern about an overall crisis in research funding has
prompted the move by the British Medical Association.
However, the National Lottery Charities Board said last night: ''There
appears to be a persistent belief in some quarters that we have said we
will not fund medical research charities. We have never said this and it
is simply not true.''
It said charities whose work was connected with helping the poor were
a priority but medical research charities would also be considered if
their application was for ''an exceptional project or initiative''.
The BMA remained unconvinced, however, and said it would still
consider legal action.
''They have taken, as far as we are concerned, a fairly cavalier
attitude,'' said a spokesman. ''Their priority is poverty -- which is
fine -- but that means medical research is being ruled out. We are
saying they have adopted a clear exclusion policy.''
Members of the BMA's medical academic staff committee also want to see
a national consultation exercise on whether research should continue to
be excluded from lottery handouts.
Committee chairman Dr Colin Smith said earlier that the exclusion was
''doubly disastrous'' as the National Lottery was also affecting
existing fund-raising.
''While the lottery is only a few months old, some medical research
charities are already reporting a drop in income attributable to lottery
fever,'' he said.
''As street and house-to-house collections suffer, the National
Lotteries Board continues to exclude medical research from financial
consideration.''
Dr Smith said he did not believe the public realised that the 40p of
lottery money that went to charity excluded ''vital research into
cancer, lung disease, and other such important work.
''I believe that it is time, even at this relatively early stage, for
the way the lottery has been run in relation to charitable causes to be
closely examined and reviewed.''

Evidence of a link between accidents in the home and social
deprivation is contained in a report submitted to Lothian Regional
Council yesterday.
The analysis, based on statistics between 1980 and 1993, found that
people living in areas identified as suffering deprivation were more
likely to be admitted to hospital as a result of accidents at home.
Social policy sub-committee chairman Councillor Paul Nolan said the
findings provided crucial information for local authorities which were
currently defining and reviewing council services because of
reorganisation.
According to the preliminary figures, 41% of Lothian residents live in
areas where home accident admission rates are higher than the Lothian
average, most notably in the peripheral housing estates of Craigmillar
and West Pilton and also in North Leith, some areas of the city centre,
and in Granton.
The report also reveals significantly higher than expected levels of
home accident-related admissions for pre-school children in Craigmillar
(three times the norm) and North Leith and Pilton (twice the norm).

A LEADING Scots lawyer has called for an international criminal court
to ensure that those who perpetrate crimes against humanity can be
brought to justice.
The court would be a global mechanism for strengthening human rights
and provide a forum to try Lockerbie-type cases as well as those accused
of war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.
The plea by Mr Ross Harper, president of the International Bar
Association, follows a call last year by Mr Andrew Hardie, QC, Dean of
the Faculty of Advocates, for Scotland to become the permanent home of a
Nuremberg-style court to try war crimes cases.
Mr Harper will put forward a resolution to create an International
Criminal Court at the Council of the International Bar Association,
which is meeting in Edinburgh between June 10 and 13.
He thinks a court of this kind would strengthen the rule of law world
wide and ensure that those who commit crimes against humanity were
speedily and effectively brought to justice ''without hindrance by race,
political allegiance, or national boundaries''.
Mr Harper said: ''The creation of an international criminal court is
the logical extension to the International Court of Justice in The
Hague, which has jurisdiction over states only, not individuals.
''Recent violations of human rights and breaches of humanitarian law
make it important that such a court be established immediately.
''The two Libyans accused of the bombing of PanAm flight 103 over
Lockerbie cannot currently be brought to justice because of political
conflicts.
''The establishment of an international criminal court would allow
proper trials to take place. Until such a body exists, individuals
suspected of serious crime will continue to enjoy immunity.''
The resolution recommends that the court would have jurisdiction over
all crimes under international law, including genocide and mass
violations of human rights, including murder, torture, and forced
transfer or deportation of populations, and war crimes.
The current legal impasse over prosecutions for the Lockerbie bombing
and the gross violations of human rights in various parts of the world,
including Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, form the background to Mr
Harper's resolution.
He takes the view that the political situation in an increasing number
of states could create a stumbling block to prosecuting crimes on a
national basis, giving immunity to those responsible and encouraging
further crimes against humanity.
Mr Harper says the Lockerbie case provides a perfect example of the
conflict between countries which allow atrocities to go unpunished.
''Libya states that it would be willing to prosecute the two
individuals (alleged by the Lord Advocate to be responsible for the
atrocity) in accordance with national law. However, the UK and the USA
have little confidence in such a prosecution.
''An existing international criminal court, if all three countries
involved were parties to the convention, could mean the end of the
conflict collision course of these three countries.
''Surrendering an individual to the international criminal court as a
politically neutral forum would be a welcome solution to such
conflicts.''

A MAN convicted of murder claimed yesterday that his victim's wife had
told him she had wanted rid of her husband and suggested ways that he
and his friend could do it.
However, Jason Simpson, 21, who said he became the lover of Nawal
Nicol three days before the killing at Ellon, Aberdeenshire, denied he
had been offered #25,000 to murder her husband.
Simpson, described as a prisoner in Perth, was given evidence at the
High Court in Forfar at the trial of Mrs Nicol, who is accused of the
murder of her husband, Stuart.
The court also heard a graphic account from Muir Middler, 26, who also
was convicted of the murder, of how he had stabbed Mr Nicol after a
drunken day, during which he said he had spent almost #100 on alcohol.
Mrs Nicol is charged with inciting Simpson and Middler to murder her
salesman husband by offering them #25,000. It is alleged she attempted
to induce her husband to accompany Simpson and Middler to Cruden Bay,
where they could strike him on the head and murder him, and that, on
June 6 last year, she left doors open in their home so that Simpson and
Middler could gain access, where they seized him, struggled with him,
and murdered him.
Simpson told the court the stabbing happened after Middler and he had
been discussing the problems in the marriage of the Nicols, with whom
they socialised.
He said there had been ''discord'' and things had been beginning to be
strained.
''Mrs Nicol started dropping hints about wanting rid of Mr Nicol,'' he
said. ''We presumed at the start she was talking about divorce but, from
discussions as things went on, it wasn't just divorce. She actually
wanted Mr Nicol killed.
''She started bringing up little methods of getting rid of him. The
first was to do with the brakes on his car.
''The next one was to take him to Slains Castle at Cruden Bay, get him
filled with drugs, possibly give him a rough-up to make him easier to
handle, and pitch him over the cliff.
''The last idea was getting into the house at night, making a noise
like a robber, and when Mr Nicol came down, he would be killed in a
fight protecting his property against whoever was in the house.''
Simpson said that on the night Mr Nicol died, Mrs Nicol had mentioned
the last plan and they had returned to the house in the early hours,
half an hour after leaving, not to murder Mr Nicol but to tell him his
wife wanted him killed.
He said he and Middler, pub bouncers in Ellon, had gone back to the
Nicols' house after their day of drinking and had left about 1.30. They
had driven to the car park of a pub in Ellon where Middler was to leave
his car because he was having difficulty driving because of the drink he
had consumed.
They stopped the car in the car park and had a cigarette, when it was
agreed they go back to the house to tell Mr Nicol. They walked back and
climbed over the back fence and entered by the patio doors which were
open. However, they then realised Mr Nicol had a phone in the bedroom
and if he heard them he might call the police and their plan to tell him
might not work, so they left and went to the front where they rang the
doorbell.
Mr Nicol answered the door in his jogging bottoms and Middler told him
he had crashed his car as an excuse to get into the house. ''It's not
every day you go to tell your mate his wife wants him killed,'' he said.
As they were in the hallway there was a scuffle and Mr Nicol ended up
on the ground, bleeding, with Middler on top of him.
Simpson claimed that he put his hand gently over Mr Nicol's mouth to
see if he was breathing and Mr Nicol bit his finger. He heard a noise
and immediately thought it might be Mr Nicol's two-year-old son, Damien.
''The last thing I wanted was him to see his father,'' he said.
He said initially he did not realise Mrs Nicol wanted her husband
killed. ''I couldn't get into my head that anyone would want to kill a
husband or wife but then more and more I got into my head she was
serious.''
He emphatically denied being offered money and could give no
explanation why Mrs Nicol had asked them to kill her husband. He also
claimed that police notes of what he had allegedly said were fabricated.
He said he had a sexual relationship with Mrs Nicol once, three days
before the murder.
Middler told the court he had very little recollection of the events
that day. He remembered stabbing Mr Nicol twice, once when he was
standing up and once when he was lying down, but he could offer no
explanation other than ''drink''.
He said he and Nicol had had a fight earlier in a pub but he could
remember little about that and could not remember the reason for it.
He said he was shocked into temporary sobriety after the stabbing and
he remembered being dragged out of the patio doors by Simpson.
He said he could not recollect being offered any money by Mrs Nicol
but said that, in the two months before the murder, when he was not
working he was always extremely drunk.
Throughout yesterday's proceedings, Mrs Nicol sat, sobbing in the
dock, as details of her husband's murder were discussed.
The trial continues.

AN airline is applying to offer #49 return flights from Edinburgh to
London. The only snag would be that passengers would have to fly to
London on Wednesday and return on a Monday.
British World Airlines charters a weekly flight from Edinburgh to
Italy for package holidays during the summer. The plane comes to
Scotland from London with no passengers and returns, also empty, at the
end of the Italian trip.
The tour operator has asked BWA if passengers can be carried between
Edinburgh and London on the empty legs and the airline has applied to
the Civil Aviation Authority for permission.
Meanwhile, cheaper fares and more competition on transatlantic routes
moved a step closer yesterday when Britain and the United States reached
a ''mini-deal'' that could eventually pave the way for a complete ''open
skies'' policy for airlines flying between the two countries.
British Airways and giant American carrier United were the immediate
beneficiaries of the agreement, which ended months of deadlock.
BA will be able to operate additional flights between London and
Philadelphia, while United will for the first time be allowed to fly
from Heathrow to Chicago.
The deal also involved both US and British carriers being allowed to
fly between UK regional airports and the US. Until recently, British and
US airlines have been restricted by complicated and archaic rules over
where they can fly to and from.

<RECORDNO>978026747</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SCRABBLE player told a judge yesterday that going to the lavatory
cost him the chance of victory in a tournament.
Mr Mike Goldman, 62, a former national champion who works as a
solicitor, claimed that when he returned from his call of nature in
Folkestone's aptly named Burstin Hotel, he found he had lost four
minutes because a timing clock had been started while he was away.
He is seeking #5000 aggravated damages -- including the #200 prize
money -- from three officials of the Association of Premier Scrabble
Players. They deny liability.
Mr Goldman, of Maida Vale, London, described at Central London County
Court how he had to force his way through five crowded rooms and
negotiate a convention of people parading as cowboys and cowgirls.
He then had to queue for further uncomfortable minutes for the only
row of over-subscribed cubicles in the 960-guest hotel.
Mr Goldman's barrister, Mr Michael Duggan, told Judge Anthony
Hallgarten: ''You will hear evidence as to the distress he has suffered
as a result of the defendants' breach of contract.''
The barrister said the central issue was whether the tournament
organisers were under a contractual duty to apply the rules ''fairly,
reasonably, and properly'', and whether sufficiant time had been
allotted between games for visits to the lavatory.
There was no mention in the rules of a game being started in the
absence of a player.
Mr Goldman's trip to the lavatory came after the second match of an 11
game tournament in December 1990.
Altogether, he was away from his seat for up to 10 minutes.
He returned to find his opponent, Cambridge Scrabble Club member John
Rusted, also 62, had scored 76 points with the word ''fanners'' by using
all his letters, then started the timing clock for Mr Goldman's move.
The loss of four minutes of the 25 allocated to each player for moves
per game contributed to him losing the 90-player tournament, he
contended.
''If I had had the extra four minutes, I think in the circumstances my
superior skill would have enabled me to overcome the disability of 76
points and very probably win the game.
''I believe I was being cheated and deprived of the opportunity of
winning the tournament and a little bit of recognition,'' Mr Goldman
said.
The case continues.

<HEADLINE>Gap in health 'has grown' between the rich and poor</HEADLINE>

GLASGOW'S health service director yesterday confirmed there was clear
scientific proof that there had been an increase in ill-health and
premature deaths over the past 15 years, reflecting the increasing gap
between rich and poor.
While Dr Harry Burns would not be drawn on openly criticising the
policies of the Conservative Government, which came to power in 1979, he
conceded that Government policy can have a ''huge influence'' on health.
The Greater Glasgow Health Board director of public health called for
a greater understanding among politicians of all parties of the social
influences affecting health and poverty and said local authorities were
probably more important in determining the health of communities than
health authorities.
Dr Burns said: ''Over the past 15 years, there has been a widening in
the incidence of ill-health and premature deaths. We have to try to
understand why that gap has increased. It is up to politicians to
produce policies to change it.
''Health professionals can supply ways of curing illness but actually
preventing it happening in the first place is much more of a social
issue. Local authorities are probably more important in determining the
health of their communities than health authorities.''
A Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party spokesman said it was
difficult to comment on such a general view being expressed by Dr Burns
without knowing the specific statistics from whichhe drew his
conclusions.
However, he added: ''What we do know is that proportionately far more
people are living longer today than they did 15 years ago.''
Scottish Liberal Democrat MP Mrs Ray Michie, the party's parliamentary
spokeswoman on Scottish affairs, said the health director's comments
''confirms what everyone outside the Government has long believed --
that Tory Governments since 1979 have presided over an unprecedented
increase in poverty which has had a seriously detrimental impact on
public health.''
Scottish National Party health spokesman Dr Iain Glen said: ''It is an
outrage that in the most energy-rich country in Europe, cold-related
winter deaths in Scotland far exceed the levels in other northern
European countries.''
Dr Burns made his comments at a conference in Glasgow at the Scottish
launch of an action pack, Poverty and Health -- Tools for Change, which
suggests practical action which policy makers, health professionals, and
voluntary groups should take to secure long-term change in the links
between poverty and health.
The pack is published by the Public Health Alliance, a national
voluntary organisation working for public health in the UK, which aims
to narrow the gap between the country's richest and poorest.
The conference heard that Glasgow still had more deprived areas than
any other city in Scotland and some of the highest levels of poverty in
Europe.
Dr Burns said babies born in deprived areas such as Drumchapel or
Easterhouse were twice as likely to have a lower birth-weight than their
affluent neighbours; were five or six times less likely to be
breast-fed; and were twice as likely to be admitted to hospital in the
first year of their lives than children of wealthy families.
He said suicide among young deprived males had increased dramatically
in recent years, while mental health problems also were more common.
Mr David Black, a community health worker in Glasgow, who compiled the
192-page pack with colleague Ms Sue Laughlin, said it would help to
offer real practical help for people trying to tackle poverty in their
communities.
It used the experiences of poor communities, analysing their successes
and failures in trying to relieve the impact of poverty on their health,
and suggested strategies that were effective at local level.
The Scottish Labour Party's assistant general secretary, Mr Tommy
Sheppard, said Dr Burns was speaking common sense and that only a fool
would not recognise the links between economic and environment policies
and public health.

A HOSPITAL which sent home a mother with a broken neck admitted last
night that another patient had also been released with a similar injury.
Mr Danny Grundy broke his neck in a swimming pool accident. He was
admitted to Royal Devon and Exeter hospital's casualty department for
treatment last month but was released after having X-rays.
The chief executive of the Royal Devon and Exeter Healthcare NHS
Trust, Mr Mark Taylor, said last night an independent review would now
be carried out. He apologised to the patients for ''their distressing
experiences''.
Mr Taylor said Mr Grundy's injury was not as serious as that of Mrs
Susan Williams, 36, who broke her neck in a car accident.
He said a ''bony bit of Mr Grundy's vertabrae had been broken'' but
not the main vertabrae. He said: ''It is well known in medical circles
that it is extremely hard on X-rays to see neck injuries.
''The standard procedures in many hospitals, including this one, is to
have cases reviewed within 24 hours by a consultant radiologist.''
He said immediate action was taken in both cases to contact the
patients after the true injury was detected.
Mr Grundy, from the Stoke on Trent area, suffered his injury at a
Dawlish campsite on May 4 and was recalled the next day.
Mrs Williams, of St Buryan, Cornwall, must now wear a metal cage-style
neck brace for three months. It was fitted in an emergency operation at
Newcastle General Hospital after she went to Tyneside to visit
relatives.
Mrs Williams, who had two vertebrae fused together using bone from her
hip, must also wear a body brace.
Her legal representative, Mrs Marie Vipond, said the matter would be
considered by the Legal Aid Board before a decision on any action was
taken.
Mrs Williams said: ''It is too early to say if I will take the matter
any further at the moment.
Mrs Williams was with her husband Michael, 36, and their children,
Philip, 12, Grant, 10, and eight-year-old Nikita, when their car was
involved in the accident in April.
''Lots of X-rays were taken and I had eight stitches in a wound to my
head,'' she said. A few hours later, the Exeter doctor told her to go.
Next day, her husband telephoned her mother during their 12-hour train
trip to Newcastle and was told the Exeter hospital had been urgently
trying to get hold of her. She was taken straight to surgery in
Newcastle.

A FOUR-YEAR campaign to have a swimming pool built in Kirkcudbright
may soon be over.
The district council has agreed that #100,000 will be made available
from the Common Good Fund if a referendum shows there is widespread
support for the scheme.
There is already #162,000 in the coffers of a charitable company set
up to build the pool and further financial support will be sought from
National Lottery funds, the Scottish Sports Council, the local
enterprise company, and other local authorities.

ONE of Britain's most influential trade union leaders yesterday sought
to improve relations with the Labour Party by pledging there could be no
return to the ''dishonest relationship of the 70s''.
The GMB general secretary, Mr John Edmonds, reminded his union's
annual conference in Brighton how in the ''beer and sandwich'' days, the
Labour Government lost the confidence of the public and the unions lost
the backing of their members. It all ended in tears with the disputes of
1979, the election of Mrs Thatcher, and the misery of the last 16 years.
''We will never make that dreadful mistake ever again,'' he pledged.
Welcoming the ''fairness not favours'' approach offered by Labour
leader Tony Blair, who is due to address delegates tomorrow, Mr Edmonds
stressed that the trade unions, as the biggest popular movement in
Britain, had the right to a proper hearing from government.
They expected to be treated as social partners and would aim to
influence issues by strength of argument.
No group could claim the right to insider dealing with a Labour
government and the unions would not seek to claim an inside track. They
would rely instead on the good sense of Labour leaders who knew that the
interests of the many were more important than the privileges of the
few.
Unions would respect the authority of the elected government but would
expect that government to respect union independence including a right
to disagree.

SERBIA'S President last night said he had persuaded the Bosnian Serbs
to free all the United Nations peacekeepers still being held hostage.
President Slobodan Milosevic's office in Belgrade said the Bosnian
Serb leaders had ''responded positively'' to a message from Milosevic
taken to them by his security chief, Jovica Stanisic.
Sources in the Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale said the UN hostages
were last night being rounded up from the various sites where they were
being held in preparation for leaving Bosnia. This mirrors events of
last Friday when 121 hostages were freed but it was not clear exactly
when the latest group might go free.
The announcement from Belgrade came minutes after Stanisic arrived in
Pale in a four-jeep convoy surrounded by a dozen Serbian secret police
carrying M-16 automatic rifles.
Milosevic's statement treated the release of the hostages as a
certainty and even added: ''The international community and all sides in
the conflict should use this moment of relaxation of high tensions to
move towards peace.''
The Bosnian Serbs had toughened their line on releasing the remaining
hostages over the weekend. Their army commander, General Ratko Mladic,
vowed not to let any more go without guarantees that Nato would not
launch any more air strikes.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic threatened a ''drastic'' response
if the UN used its beefed-up fire power to try to force through supplies
to besieged ''safe areas''.
He said his forces would not tolerate any move by Britain's UN
commander, Lieutenant-General Rupert Smith, to open supply corridors to
Sarajevo or other isolated pockets.
''Only Serbs can open the corridor through Serb territory and not
General Smith. Any forceful opening of the corridor is out of the
question,'' he said, threatening fresh retaliation if the UN ''turned
against the Serbs'' inside their self-styled Bosnian republic.
''Until now we treated them pretty mildly. Next time it will be
drastic. There is no General Smith who is sovereign on the Republic of
Srpska territory,'' Karadzic said.
The Greek Defence and Foreign Ministers had arrived in Pale earlier
yesterday for talks with Karadzic in a surprise Athens initiative to win
freedom for the UN hostages.
The Greeks are Orthodox Christians like the Serbs and are the only
Western country to have maintained strong ties with Belgrade and the
Bosnian Serbs.
Milosevic officially severed ties with the Bosnian Serbs last August
but has flexed his muscles there in recent days in order to bolster his
standing with the West as a peacemaker.
That could translate into concessions in deadlocked talks to suspend
the UN sanctions imposed three years ago on the rump of the old
Yugoslavia which he rules.
Meanwhile, Russia signalled yesterday that it would not veto
deployment of the Nato rapid response force being assembled in Bosnia.
Moscow openly dislikes the Alliance plan to send in up to 10,000
British, French, and Dutch soldiers backed by US air power.
However, Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev yesterday said he
wanted to discuss strengthening the UN operation within its present
mandate rather than talking about a possible veto.
''I'm not contemplating to veto or not to veto. What we are eager to
discuss is how to strengthen the operation within its present mandate in
the framework of the UN procedure,'' he said. Kozyrev arrives in Britain
today for talks with Prime Minister John Major.
Serbs again shelled Sarajevo yesterday and stepped up pressure on
other government-held enclaves. Sarajevo officials said two men were
seriously wounded when a shell landed in the city centre at midday.
Bosnian state radio said Serb shelling on Sunday killed eight and
wounded 31 in a suburb near the airport.
Serbs also fired artillery or tank rounds on the ''safe areas'' of
Bihac town, Srebrenica, and Gorazde.
UN peacekeepers reported some 3000 civilians in the Srebenica pocket
fled their homes and headed into the town amid fears of an impending
Serb attack, while Dutch soldiers in the area came under Serb fire. No
injuries were reported.
Western moves to reinforce the UN contingent continued yesterday with
British artillery beginning to arrive in central Bosnia.

MORE than #5m is to be invested in an Ayrshire company which has
enjoyed a remarkable turnaround in fortune.
The investment is aimed at a 50% increase in sales, and the creation
of 120 jobs.
Prestwick Circuits has been the subject of a number of rescue packages
and a change of management in the last two years: it is now in profit
and concentrating on its core business of printed circuit board (PCB)
manufacture.
The company, under chairman Archie Coulson and a new board, has been
working to re-establish itself among the market leaders in Europe.
Mr Coulson yesterday announced an expansion plan which is
unprecedented in the company's history and said that the financial
backers are 100% behind the plan.
For more than two years, the company was viewed in the industry as
struggling, with the share price falling away and the focus on survival
rather than competition in the fierce electronics markets.
Now the company is providing PCBs from its plants at Ayr and Irvine to
many of the world's leading computing, automotive, communications, and
electronics companies. Among the leading customers are Digital, IBM,
Marconi, and Ford.
The growth of electronics in cars has led to a boom for the company.
Corporate development director Russell Cameron said yesterday: ''Every
car in Europe has a Prestwick circuit board somewhere in the
electronics.''
He added: ''We have gone through some tough times and have had to make
some difficult decisions. In the past, we sometimes promised what we
could not deliver but now these days are over and we are ready to
grow.''
Mr Coulson said: ''Prestwick is simply fulfilling its potential as a
world leader in the supply of PCBs. As far back as the early 1970s,
Prestwick was a leading provider of product and technological know-how
and now, after a few hard knocks, it is filling its order books and
restructuring to lead the UK and European industry.
''The company and its advisers are confident that all of our
objectives are achievable. We are already a customer-driven operation
with excellent relationships with some of the biggest and best companies
in the world. Today, we are announcing that we intend to capitalise on
this situation.''

A MOTHER who claimed she fought off a bogus health visitor who tried

A spokesman for the procurator-fiscal in Edinburgh said yesterday
there were no plans to press charges against 35-year-old Mrs Lynne
Stewart.
A major police hunt, involving dozens of officers, was launched in
April after Mrs Stewart claimed a smartly-dressed woman posing as a
health visitor had tried to abduct her baby daughter Erin from the
family home in South Gyle, Edinburgh.
Police later focused attention on the mother-of-two after attempts to
trace the woman allegedly responsible proved fruitless.

GLASGOW gave the go-ahead yesterday to a #77m plan to revamp the
city's 8000 acres of open space.
Councillors agreed the city's 74 parks should be upgraded over 10
years to meet modern leisure needs.
Park lighting will be installed and more rangers will be employed to
create a ''feel-safe'' factor. Market research revealed that personal
safety was a key factor among potential users.
Parks convener Councillor Colin McNicol said: ''Other European cities
are already reshaping their green areas. We are conscious that many of
our present facilities were established in the Victorian era.''
The bulk of the #77m capital cost will come from the council itself.

THREE men and a 14-year-old schoolgirl were accused yesterday of
murdering a man in a Glasgow park last Friday.
Mr Richard Bell, 20, and Mr Richard Ferguson, 16, both of Tarfside
Oval, South Cardonald, Glasgow, Mr John Cairns, 18, of no fixed address,
and the girl appeared in private at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
It is alleged that in Queen's Park in the city's south side they
assaulted 35-year-old Michael Doran of Allison Street, Govanhill,
Glasgow in Queen's Park, stabbed him, injuring him so severely he died
in hospital the same day, and robbed him of a jacket and two bank cards.
All four are also charged with assaulting and robbing two other men in
the park that day.
No plea was made on behalf of the accused who were remanded in
custody.

THE HANGING Shed in Barlinnie, where nine men died on the gallows
between 1946 and 1960, is to be demolished this year.
When work starts on the reconstruction of Barlinnie's D hall in a few
months, what is known as the execution suite will be destroyed, and with
it a grim chapter of history.
The deputy governor of Barlinnie, Mrs Kate Donegan, said yesterday:
''It is my personal view, but I will be glad to see it gone.
''Over the years it has been a closed-off part of the prison which
everyone was aware was there but which no-one really thought about. It
is a total anachronism and has no place in modern penal thinking.''
This view was echoed by Glasgow lawyer Len Murray, who represented
teenager Tony Miller, the last man to hang on the Barlinnie gallows,
almost 35 years ago.
He commented: ''My experience in acting for Tony Miller left an
indelible mark on me. I am delighted that this relic of an appalling
episode on our history is about to disappear. The whole experience is
one I would never wish on any young member of my profession.''
The Hanging Shed and the gallows has been maintained over the years
because capital punishment remained on the Statute Book for treason and
sedition, and Scotland was required to retain a facility.
Although parliamentary majorities against capital punishment have
grown each time the House of Commons is sounded, the facilities were
kept largely in case that view changed.
Although the Barlinnie execution suite will vanish, a smaller one will
be maintained in Perth Prison.
With enormous pressure on space in Scottish prisons, the need to make
use of every square yard for cells is pressing. Barlinnie is constantly
a third overcrowded.
The plan to renovate Barlinnie's D Hall will mean dividing the
Victorian building into four smaller halls, each accommodating around 50
men, which will allow closer and more beneficial management.
The #5.2m plan will sweep away most of the Victorian paraphernalia of
the hall, dividing it vertically and horizontally, bringing with it in
the process night sanitation to the prisoners for the first time. The
cells will also have electricity installed.
The Barlinnie Hanging Shed was capable of executing three prisoners
simultaneously, but it was never required for multiple executions.
Although building started at Barlinnie in 1880, the first hanging in
the jail was not until 1946. The previous hanging in the city was at
Duke Street Prison on August 3, 1928, when George Reynolds was executed
for the murder of a bakehouse fireman.
The men who died at Barlinnie were:
February 8, 1946 -- John Lyon, 21; April 6, 1946 -- Patrick Carraher,
39; August 10, 1946 -- John Caldwell, 20; October 30, 1950 -- Paul
Christopher Harris, 28; December 16, 1950 -- James Ronald Robertson, 33;
May 29, 1952 -- Patrick Gallacher Deveney, 42; January 26, 1953 --
George Francis Shaw; July 11, 1958 -- Peter Manuel, 32; December 22,
1960 -- Anthony Miller, 19.
The case of Miller, the last man to be hanged -- not Peter Manuel as
popular misconception has it -- left an indelible mark on Mr Murray, now
a distinguished elder statesman of the Scottish legal profession.
It was a mixture of anguish and anger which made him a life-long
opponent of capital punishment. He describes his stance with great power
over two chapters of a forthcoming book. The Herald today carries a
shortened version of Mr Murray's description of the events.

BOSNIA mediator Lord Owen yesterday attacked the United States for
using ''bellicose language'' on the crisis and urged Washington to be
more discreet in future.
Lord Owen, who has announced he is stepping down from his role at the
end of the month, said: ''One of the current difficulties in resolving
the crisis is the bellicose language used by the United States.''
Referring to American calls for air strikes and lifting of the ban on
arms sales to the Bosnian Muslims, he told the French newspaper Le
Figaro: ''Who can believe that the solution to the conflict can be found
in increasing the firepower of one side or the other?''
Washington should ''exercise a decent discretion'' in its
pronouncements, he said, adding: ''I am not disposed to take lessons
from the Americans after the fiasco of their Somalia operation.''
Lord Owen insisted the key to resolving the crisis was to remain
impartial, favouring neither the Serbs nor the Muslims.

THE Prime Minister was facing a series of political rows over Sir
Richard Scott's arms-to-Iraq inquiry last night after it was disclosed
the final report would be delayed again, and one of his Ministers was
criticised in a leak.
The report should have been published almost a year ago.
However, an extract of Sir Richard's draft report leaked to the BBC
said Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave, a former Foreign Office
Minister, had given ''untrue'' information to MPs about Britain's
defence sales to Iraq.
The draft extract also said that Mr Major during his brief tenure as
Foreign Secretary had sent ''inaccurate'' letters to MPs about British
policy -- but officials were blamed for not briefing him properly.
Labour trade and industry spokesman Brian Wilson said the disclosures
were ''devastating'' for Mr Waldegrave and ''highly disparaging'' of Mr
Major. ''Small wonder that the Tories are procrastinating so desperately
over completion of the report.''
Mr Waldegrave in a statement last night said he ''utterly and
totally'' rejected the criticisms reported by the BBC. ''I am confident
that I will persuade the inquiry that these provisional views are wrong
and unfair and that they should not appear in the final report,'' he
said.
The BBC Nine O'Clock News reported that the draft extract describes Mr
Waldegrave as one of the ''midwives'' of the Government's secret
decision to relax its restrictions on defence sales to Iraq but not to
Iran during their war. However, Mr Waldegrave failed to disclose the
policy shift in a number of letters to MPs who had inquired about
Britain's stance.
The draft extract mentions a letter he sent to Conservative MP Tom
Sackville, now a junior health Minister, declaring: ''The Government has
pursued a policy of impartiality.''
Sir Richard, in his draft report, said: ''Mr Waldegrave's letter . . .
and his other letters in like terms, were apt to mislead readers.''
In another letter, to the Labour MP Nigel Griffiths, Mr Waldegrave
stated the Government had not changed its policy on defence sales to
Iraq and Iran.
Sir Richard stated that Mr Waldegrave had in his evidence to the
inquiry ''consistently and strenuously'' claimed the Government's policy
to Iraq had not changed despite ''a volume of incontrovertible
evidence'' to the contrary.
Downing Street issued a statement saying Mr Major deplored the
''malicious'' leak of the extract and hoped it would not prejudice the
final report. ''The Prime Minister believes in Mr Waldegrave's
integrity. Mr Waldegrave has his full support,'' the statement said.
Downing Street sources also confirmed that Mr Major had seen the
extracts relating to his own conduct. ''He was invited to comment and he
has done so. Sir Richard will no doubt wish to take account of those
comments in preparing his final report,'' the source said.
In his evidence to the inquiry, Mr Major said his officials at the
Foreign Office had not told him about the shift in policy towards Iraq.
The draft report states that Mr Major had been informed in an official
briefing paper that the Government's guidelines had been applied with
''greater flexibility'' towards the Baghdad regime. However, it does not
blame Mr Major for failing to appreciate the implications of what he was
being told.
Nevertheless, Sir Richard expressed surprise that Mr Major, who became
Foreign Secretary in June 1989, was still writing letters to MPs the
following September stating that the policy had not changed. ''It might
have been expected that by September Mr Major would have become aware,''
the draft report said.
Labour's Shadow foreign secretary Robin Cook said that if the leak was
accurate Mr Waldegrave should resign. Earlier he claimed Whitehall was
obstructing the investigation.
He accused the Prime Minister of trying to distance himself from the
inquiry in an effort to protect ministerial colleagues.
Cabinet Ministers and senior civil servants are expected to be
condemned by Sir Richard in his final report, and some have taken legal
advice.
Inquiry secretary Christopher Muttukumaru said the latest postponement
was partly due to delays by Ministers and officials in responding to the
inquiry's requests for information. He said witnesses, including some
Ministers, had demanded additional time to reply to criticisms of their
conduct contained in Sir Richard's draft report.
Some of the witnesses, who have been sent the relevant extracts of the
draft, had presented fresh documentation to back up their claims and
there had also been requests for legal advice before responding to the
inquiry.
The hold-up had been exacerbated because of delays by Government
departments in supplying all the documentation that the inquiry had
originally asked for two years ago.
He said the report would not now be published until September at the
earliest.
Liberal Democrat spokesman, Mr Menzies Campbell, said it was
''unfortunate'' that Sir Richard still had not completed his report.
''It does appear that, time after time, he has been thwarted in his
efforts to get to the truth because of the late publication of
documents,'' he said on BBC Radio 4's World at One.
Five current Ministers, including Mr Waldegrave, could face possible
criticism in the final report, with Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell
thought to be particularly vulnerable. Chancellor Kenneth Clarke,
Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, and Social Security Secretary Peter
Lilley, who all signed Public Interest Immunity certificates -- the
so-called ''gagging orders'' -- in the Matrix Churchill arms-to-Iraq
trial, may also be criticised.
Mr Clarke has stated publicly that he will resign if he is criticised.

<HEADLINE>Lingerbay superquarry rejected by the council</HEADLINE>

THE WESTERN Isles Council last night voted to turn its back on the
biggest development yet proposed for the islands, the #70m Harris
superquarry.
Two years after it had voted to support the Lingerbay superquarry, the
council changed its mind in recognition of the fact that the people of
Harris had altered their views in a second referendum.
By 21 votes to eight the council resolved that the nature and scale of
the proposed quarry is prejudicial to the integrity of the area and
compromises other developments which depend on clean air and water.
The decision was taken after three hours of debate, at times heated,
and faxed letters from the council's legal advisers warning of possible
consequences.
The Secretary of State, who will make the final decision on the
quarry, is to be informed. So will the public inquiry and Chief Inquiry
Reporter Gillian Pain as the inquiry reconvenes in Leverburgh later this
morning.
The council's QC, Dr Robert Reed, has already threatened to quit and
the inquiry reporter has indicated that she may have to delay the ending
of the inquiry which has already lasted eight months.
The council may also now face the prospect of being charged expenses
by other parties to the inquiry.
Dr Reed has been representing the council at the public inquiry for
the last eight months on the basis that the council supported the
superquarry.
Dr Reed made clear in a message to the meeting that he would have to
consider his own position if the council now voted to withdraw its
support from the quarry: ''If there is an adverse vote, I will certainly
need clear instructions in respect of these matters.
''Whether I am able to accept the instructions will depend on their
terms: as I have already indicated, I could not accept instructions to
deliver submissions inconsistent with those I have just delivered.''
The change of heart by the council followed the vote against the
superquarry in the recent referendum on Harris, a complete reversal of
the support it had enjoyed in an earlier referendum in June 1993.
One councillor said earlier that a change of policy now would make the
council an ''object of ridicule''. The council has already spent
#375,000 supporting the superquarry.
The council's director of administration and legal services, Mr Robb
Barnett, read a letter from the chief executive of Scottish Natural
Heritage, Mr Roger Crofts, making clear there was no truth in the rumour
that the SNH would sue the council for damages if its position were
reversed.
The move calling for a change in the council's position had been put
to last night's meeting by Mr Colin Campbell, Benbecula. He said the
Secretary of State, the public inquiry and the Reporter should be so
informed.
He stated: ''How could anybody say it was unreasonable that as a
result of all the information that has come out of the inquiry that
people are not entitled to change their minds? All the information about
dust, noise, and vibration levels, the health risks of working in that
environment.''
Council vice-convener Angus Graham opposed Mr Campbell. He warned that
for the council to change its mind in the last days of the public
inquiry after supporting the superquarry ''would mean we are the object
of ridicule. The world once again would be laughing at us.''
A blistering attack on the role of Scottish Natural Heritage in the
public inquiry was launched yesterday by Mr Roy Martin QC for the
developers, Redland Aggregates Ltd.
Redlands plan to extract 600 million tonnes of anorthosite over 60
years from Lingerbay which is in a National Scenic Aea.
At the start of his 213-page closing submission he said that the
activities of SNH -- both before and during the inquiry -- had given
rise to a very real concern about a publicly funded body which ought to
have been acting in a responsible and accountable way.
He also submitted that it acted outwith its remit, and if the
Secretary of State took into account one of its submissions, then that
decision could be challenged in the Court of Session.

THREE men were detained late last night after a major police operation
on the western shore of Loch Lomond.
Armed officers and police dogs from both Central and Strathclyde
Police spent three hours outside a hotel in Inverarnan before
apprehending the men when they left after closing time.
The operation, which involved scores of officers, followed an earlier
report that two men, one allegedly carrying a gun, had been involved in
an incident with a farmer in Glen Falloch, near the northern tip of the
loch.
Central Scotland Police sent its tactical response team from Stirling
to Inverarnan. Officers from Glasgow stood by to provide assistance, and
a helicopter was mobilised.
The A82 road along the lochside was sealed to all traffic at two
points, with officers stationed over a five-mile stretch. No one was
hurt, said police.
