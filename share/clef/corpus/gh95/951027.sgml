Stewart Fraser goes bargain hunting.
EVERYONE seems to agree that it's been a great time for boat shows,
and boat sales in the West.
''A very good time indeed. We have had excellent results,'' says Stan
Prosser. ''And we're still going on. Don't forget that.'' he adds.
In fact, there are some special offers this weekend, just to get the
message well and truly home.
''The gloves are off. We're out to persuade people to buy a boat. I'm
making some super offers,'' he says.
Like a 1992 Bayliner that was going for #22,995. Now, it's yours for
#16,500. At the other end, there's a 10-ft rowing boat that was #495 --
try #100 instead.
The motorboat specialists reckon to have sold 47 boats this month
already. Some tempting summer weather is resulting in exceptional
interest, and turnover is an interesting 35% up on last year as a whole.
Can't be bad.
Down at Kip, they're pretty happy as well. The boat show there did
''extremely well'', with 42 boats sold in a good cross section of
prices, sizes and varieties.
If anything, things were even better than last year, and there was
every indication people had come specifically to buy, rather than simply
to enjoy the scenery.
The new service centre, showing off a range of motor boats for its
first public viewing, proved a worthwhile addition. In fact, the marina
people are so pleased with the results that they have set the dates for
next year's show already.
Euroyachts, at the Largs yacht haven, can echo the same note of good
cheer. Even more people came along than in the previous year - and that
was a successful one. And sales are at least as good as last year -
always an important consideration.
One interesting aspect was the number coming in as first-time buyers,
and the number who came with their families.
This, after all, is the time when people go out to buy, and get ready
for next season. It always pays to look ahead in this game.
Troon also has a yacht haven, both places come under the Lymington
flag these days, and a good deal of money has been pumped in, to upgrade
the facility and make it more inviting for visitors and berth-holders.
Between those using the marina and members of the local cruising club
with their own arrangements in hand, the number of craft here must be
between 300 and 400.
There is also a strong move for redevelopment at the Rhu end of the
firth. This past weekend was really the first for some time that the
marina had been so active in the general scene. It paid off with ''lots
and lots of people'' coming along.
Shore storage and parking areas have been tidied up, and new power and
water points installed, improving facilities for winter storage. The
floating breakwaters protecting the marina from south and west have also
undergone a major refurbishment.
Planning permission has been sought for a new dock to work in
conjunction with a 20-ton travel lift, to be operational by spring of
next year.
Incidentally, Rhu Marina Sales and Nick Stratton Yachts have merged,
to provide an experienced team covering brokerage and new boat sales.
On the east coast, the Port Edgar club has its autumn and winter
series. Visitors should ask about a special offer for berthing, which
involves taking part in a number of races. Winter Sunday series are
being held from November 5 to December 17.
New users of Port Edgar facilities include Westwood Mouldings, who are
fibreglass specialists, and the South Queensferry Ski Club. It all helps
to keep the place active over the so-called quiet months. That's when
most of the work gets done, in reality.

GLASWEGIANS have long had a special affection and affinity for Indian
food, and this is reflected in the large number of excellent restaurants
to be found throughout the city.
You might think there are enough establishments already, but the new
Taj Mahal at 573 Sauchiehall Street -- just 50 yards west of Charing
Cross -- offers not only the finest of Indian cuisine, but also promises
a completely new dining experience in its tastefully decorated, spacious
surroundings.
Some people are still on the prowl for a quick curry after the pub on
a Friday night, and there are plenty of restaurants to cater for them.
But if, like an increasing number of people, you are on the lookout for
elegant and sophisticated surroundings in which to enjoy a leisurely
meal, then the Taj Mahal is the place.
Its fresh and subtle decor is considerably lighter in touch than in
many a traditional Indian establishment. Fresh pinks and greys are
restful to the eye, and this is a place to savour and enjoy food without
being crushed or rushed.
Of course Glaswegians are extremely discerning when it comes to
quality in Indian food, and the proof of the pudding is in the eating.
The Taj Mahal's chef has superb credentials and is well known to many
city devotees, coming as he does from many years as chef at the Ashoka
in Elderslie Street, and a few years as proprietor of the Colonial.
Owner of the Taj Mahal, Mohammed Mushtag, is very proud to have chef
Malky as head of his large kitchens, supported by a well-trained,
experienced and knowledgeable staff.
Malky is no shadowy figure, but has made many friends in Glasgow and
acquired a superb reputation. His mouth-watering menu includes many
traditional favourites as well as new savoury dishes, mainly from the
Punjabi region in North India.
Charcoal-fired clay ovens called tandoors give a distinctive flavour
to the food cooked in them. Meat is marinaded for at least 24 hours in a
delicate blend of natural yoghurt with cumin seeds, ginger, pureed
garlic, green chillies, mint, mustard oil and lemon juice, then cooked
in the tandoor on skewers.
Baltis, which are also highly favoured in the West of Scotland, are
cooked by a quite different technique, in an extremely hot wok, all
ingredients at once, rather than in the manner of a traditional curry
which is served with sauces of varying degrees of spiciness.
Choosing from a large and unfamiliar menu can be mind-boggling,
especially to the uninitiated, but Taj Mahal staff are more than happy
to give advice on what to eat. For those of us who enjoy a variety of
flavours and textures, the restaurant has buffet nights to enable you to
try new dishes.
These buffet nights, Monday to Thursday from 6.30pm to 10.30pm are a
popular way to get to know Indian food, and at #9.95 per head, #5 for
children, they represent excellent value for money.
Sunday brunch at a respectably late time of day -- from 4pm to 7pm --
is also a popular family option, while the Taj Mahal's business and
executive lunches offer something deliciously different for workers in
need of a rest from the stresses of the office.
A pre-theatre supper is a good idea, and the Taj Mahal makes a restful
venue for an early and not too hurried meal.
Many lovers of Indian food are vegetarians, and the Taj Mahal menu has
a comprehensive selection of beautifully presented and spicy non-meat
dishes. Tasty aubergine masala, karela or okra bhaji, saag aloo (a
spinach dish) or arial, which is a concoction of mixed vegetables with
coconut, bananas, yogurt and spices, are just a few of the vegetarian
dishes which are also likely to tempt serious carnivores.
There is a charming section which can seat 80 to 100 guests in
comfort.
The restaurant is open Monday to Thursday 12pm to 2.30pm, and 5pm
until midnight. On Friday and Saturday it's open from noon until 1am,
and on Sunday from 4pm until midnight.

Charlie Woods,
chief executive of Scotland Europa, looks at the possibility of a
single European currency.
The most significant economic ''what if'' hanging over Europe at the
moment concerns the future of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) which
will include a single European currency.
EMU will have many profound implications for firms, households and
individuals in Europe. Any business that is trying to plan its actions
in Europe over the coming years needs to be alive to what might happen
and keep a careful eye on how events actually unfold.
In theory EMU shouldn't be much of a ''what if'' at all because it was
agreed at Maastricht, along with a timetable for its introduction and
the circumstances under which it would occur.
To summarise: a number of criteria (covering inflation rates, interest
rates, public debt and exchange rate stability) were agreed which would
determine whether the economies of EU Member States had converged
sufficiently to allow EMU to begin.
If a majority of countries meet the criteria by 1996, EMU will begin
in 1997. If EMU doesn't begin in 1997 then those countries that meet the
criteria by 1998 will be the founder members of EMU in 1999. Because, in
theory, it is all signed and sealed EMU doesn't even need to be
discussed at the Inter-Governmental Conference which begins next year.
In practice things are not so straightforward. As the dates for
implementing EMU draw nearer and EU members examine in detail just what
joining or not joining EMU might mean for their economics, it is clear
that there is still a long way twixt cup and lip.
Some member states such as Spain and Italy are extremely worried about
not meeting the criteria and being left behind in a two-speed Europe.
Others such as Denmark and the UK are more concerned about the
implications of joining and losing control over one of the key tools of
macro economic policy management; this worry manifested itself in the
opt-outs from EMU which both countries negotiated and which they will
have to decide whether to exercise.
Things are further complicated by the fact that the Maastricht treaty
leaves some room for interpretation. For example, do the convergence
criteria have to have been met in full by the due date or is good
progress towards meeting them insufficient.
For countries like Belgium (which are considered by many as a must for
membership as it is already effectively part of a D-mark block) how the
criteria are interpreted is important, because on current projections
they have little hope of hitting the public debt criteria in time.
Flexibility towards Belgium would, however, create an awkward
precedent which Italy would probably seek to exploit. Before you know it
the relatively straightforward criteria of the Treaty could be replaced
by political and diplomatic horse trading.
Items that might be traded could include support for expansion of the
EU east and south, support for greater political union, support for the
CAP and support for claims on the structural funds. Such a scenario
terrifies many in Germany who see the protest of sharing a currency
which is meant to embody the virtues of the D-mark yet could look more
like a cross between the drachma and the escudo.
Just who eventually joins an EMU and on what terms will have a big
impact on the strength of the new currency. This will also have an
impact on the relative strength of the currencies of the countries that
don't join.
The ''Euro'' (allegedly the current favourite name of the finance
ministers, although recent reports that the plural of Euro in Greek
means urine may lead to a rethink), or whatever it is eventually called,
should be stronger than the currencies it replaces, however, some find
it hard to see it being stronger than the D-mark already is and this
again is giving many Germans cause for concern.
The economic benefits of a currency union include reduced transaction
costs (estimated by the Commission to be worth around 0.5% of GDP),
reduced trading uncertainties and easier and cheaper travelling. The
main cost of EMU to a member state is that it removes one of the tools
that a country can use to manage its economy, in that it will no longer
be able to devalue or revalue its exchange rate in response to external
shocks.
This means that other variables (that tend to respond much more
slowly) such as wages or migration have to absorb the full impact of
such shocks and/or there have to be financial transfers within the union
to compensate for the shock.
There are some who argue that the compensatory action needed within a
currency union, added to the need to manage economic and monetary policy
in the interests of all the countries involved in the union as a whole,
requires much closer political union. For some this is a logical next
step on a road that began with the Treaty of Rome and led to the single
market and other common European policies.
For others who feel that too much sovereignty has already been pooled
it is a complete anathema. Just how and whether this difference is
resolved will be central to the political and economic future of Europe.
Some also argue that the single market requires a single currency to
realise its full potential. While EMU would make the operation of the
single market easier there is no reason why it is necessary. However, if
EMU goes ahead between some countries there may be pressure from them to
require certain guarantees from those outside EMU not to overly exercise
their freedom to devalue and thus undermine the competitiveness of those
in the currency union.
There have been a number of complaints already from German and French
industry about ''competitive devaluation'' in the UK and Italy since
these countries left the ERM. Such pressures are likely to increase with
a partial EMU and it could affect the operations of the single market.
The future of the EMU project is far from certain. The attitude of the
new French Government is unclear as it wrestles to maintain its
commitment to EMU (which involves spending cuts and/or increased taxes)
while simultaneously trying to reduce high unemployment. German public
opinion and the need for the Bundestag to ratify the terms on which
Germany eventually joins EMU also muddy the water.
The one thing which seems certain is that the first possible start
date for EMU in 1997 will pass without EMU coming into being because
insufficient countries will have met the Maastricht criteria (only two
curently meet them).
Nevertheless, EU finance ministers recently discussed progress on EMU
at their meeting in Valencia and despite some pretty acrimonious
sparring beforehand they declared the EMU plans for 1999 were on track.
To prove it, they reached a consensus on some of the details underlying
implementation.
For example, they agreed that actual data for 1997 rather than
projections, will be used in 1998 to judge how well countries have met
the convergence criteria. This should make qualification to join harder
and should mean the criteria are less open to interpretation.
For what its worth if I was to stick my neck out (and break the oldest
rule in the forecaster's handbook by predicting what might happen as
well as when!), I think that despite the Maastricht Treaty (or maybe
because of it) it is unlikely that EMU between a majority of member
states will begin before the end of the century.
However, everyone with business interests in Europe should keep a
close watch on EMU developments and be ready to take advantage of the
eventual outcome whatever it is.

<HEADLINE>#250,000 promotion bonus was only a 'publicity stunt'</HEADLINE>

PARTICK Thistle chairman Jim Oliver yesterday told a court that he
offered his team a #250,000 promotion bonus -- safe in the knowledge he
would never have to pay up.
He also decided that an #8000 insurance premium to cover the
possibility was not worth bothering about..
However, he emphasised that the offer was for the 1990-91 season,
before players David Irons and Ray Farningham joined the club.
The pair claim they were each offered a #20,000 cut of a #250,000
promotion jackpot as an incentive to sign.
The team was promoted to the Premier League in season 1991-92 and both
players are now each suing the club at the Court of Session for the
#20,000.
Mr Irons, 34, from Stirling, who is now with St Johnstone FC, and Mr
Farningham, from Dundee, now with Dundee FC, also claim they are owed
#5000 as part of their signing-on fee.
The club, which is contesting the action, claims the players were paid
the ''agreed'' signing-on fee of #15,000 and #6000 in promotion bonuses.
Mr Oliver said he offered the #250,000 as a promotion bonus for
1990-91 to build some positive publicity for the club which had been at
a low ebb in September 1990 when he took over.
He added it had been done, ''in the sure and certain knowledge that it
would not be won''.
Asked if there was any chance of Thistle winning promotion in 1990-91,
Mr Oliver replied, ''sadly, none whatsoever''.
Mr Oliver went on to say that, at the end of the next season, when the
team did go up, a total of #100,000 was distributed to players and
others as a bonus.
He rejected suggestions made earlier that he threatened to put Irons
out of the game in 1993 if he did not drop the court action and sign a
new contract with the club.
''David Irons at that time was our single biggest asset, it was in our
interest to have him playing and failing that it was in our interest to
sell him for as much as possible,'' said Mr Oliver.
''To suggest that we would not realise that asset, even if we had the
power and no club has the power to put a player out of the game, is not
only untrue, it is plain daft.''
Mr Oliver also denied that the use of a club car had been withdrawn
from Farningham and Irons as punishment because of the court action.
The hearing, before Lord Hamilton, continues.

THERE will be no European cash for Grampian's flood-hit farmers, Dr
Howard Fisher, the region's director of economic development, said
yesterday. He was replying to Keith councillor Rhona Patterson who asked
for an update on compensation for crop damage and secondary effects
caused by the severe September flooding. Dr Fisher said a report from
the Scottish Agricultural College would be given to next week's economic
development committee.

WARRINGTON have opened talks with Jonathan Davies about the Welshman's
future -- and developments are expected within the next few days.
Cardiff want Davies -- who retired from international rugby league
after Wales' recent World Cup semi-final defeat against England -- to
return to the union code.
Davies, who switched nearly seven years ago, is eager to return home
to South Wales due to family and business commitments. But Warrington
chairman Peter Higham said: ''Jonathan knows where he stands with us
contractually.''
The club have rejected a #30,000 offer from Cardiff for Davies, whose
deal at Wilderspool has two years to run. ''We have made our position
clear,'' added Higham, ''and Jonathan has told us what he would like.
Cardiff's offer is unacceptable and if they or any other club want to
sign Jonathan, they will have to pay realistic compensation.''
After Saturday's defeat at Old Trafford, Davies hinted that he might
even retire from rugby altogether if things are not sorted out. ''It was
my last rugby league international -- that's definite,'' he said.
''Whether it's my last game of rugby league we'll have to wait and
see.''
When asked where he thought his future lay, Davies replied: ''Maybe in
retirement,'' adding: ''My future is in South Wales. I've a couple of
business interests there. My priorities have changed now -- to my
family. If things do not get sorted out, retirement will be the
answer.''

MORTON have been put on standby for yet another bid for midfielder
Derek McInnes. Manager Allan McGraw said last night: ''An English first
division club have been in contact today and have told me that they will
make a definite bid in the morning.''
Morton are also expecting word from other clubs, with Rangers
remaining favourites to sign McInnes, who believed that his appearance
last Saturday against St Johnstone would be his final game as a Morton
player.
Certainly, Morton had expected McInnes to be on the move earlier this
week and before they meet Dumbarton tomorrow. The signs still suggest he
could be an Ibrox player tonight.
McGraw added: ''For Derek's sake I hope it is all sorted out quickly,
as it has dragged on. If he was still our player by Saturday I would
need to ask him how he felt about playing.
''I don't think he would be in the correct frame of mind, but it would
depend very much on what he says to me.''

A new Scottish body is encouraging employees to take responsibility
for their own enterprises, and their prospects look good, reports
Francis Shennan.
A RECEPTION at the House of Commons yesterday rounded off a week of
events aimed at promoting an alternative way of owning and running
companies.
It can make greater demands on the staff of the companies but it can
offer them greater rewards, too, and not purely financial ones.
Employee Ownership Week was launched in Glasgow last week with a
business forum at the City Chambers attended by 100 people involved in
economic development, including several MPs.
It also marked the launch of a new body, Employee Ownership Scotland
-- chaired by Laurence Clarke -- to replace the eight-year-old Scottish
Co-operatives Development Council as the vehicle for promoting
investment in their own companies by employees.
Mike Finlayson, chief executive of Employee Ownership Scotland, said:
''It is not about workers taking over the factory -- it is about
exercising responsibility as share-owners.
''It allows participation and employees getting a sense of ownership
of the business. They also get a financial reward the more successful
the business is.''
The definition of employee ownership is a company which is 51% or more
owned by the staff, either directly or held in trust for them. It has a
long history.
In 1929 John Lewis put his company in trust for the employees, which
was the birth of the John Lewis Partnership. It now has more than 30,000
employees.
Employee Share Ownership Plans were introduced in the United States
earlier this century although the first UK company to use this format to
give employees a real stake was Roadchef in 1987.
Last year the Scottish paper-making company Tullis Russell embarked on
a major capital reconstruction which transferred all the shares once
held by the Russell family and outside shareholders to employees, an
employee benefit trust and the charitable Russell Trust.
After a year's service all employees are offered shares free of charge
and paid for out of company profits.
''Employee ownership is unlikely to become dominant or even the major
form of corporate development in Scotland, but it will grow in
significance and influence in the years ahead,'' said Hamish Morrison,
chief executive of the Scottish Council Development and Industry, one of
the speakers at the forum.
He suggested the use of employee-owned businesses as a way of
countering the effects of temporary and casual working. ''Technological
advances and cost controls have turned many former employees into
labour-only contractors.
''The loss of corporate benefits such as paid holidays and pension
schemes is already painfully apparent to many in this situation. It is
also becoming evident to companies employing workers on temporary
contracts that quality of service, training standards and delivery
guarantees can deteriorate.
''In some cases it will be appropriate for contract workers to come
together to form enterprises which can provide a commercial
infrastructure, reassure the customer on quality and delivery, and
improve continuity of income and financial security for the individual.
''An employee-owned firm might be attractive to new kinds of
occupation in information technology, the media and leisure
industries.''
It can also work in traditional industries such as knitwear. Last year
Courtaulds closed its Glen Alva Knitwear subsidiary in Kilsyth. In
January of this year Glendale Knitwear of Kirkintilloch was launched as
an employee-owned firm.
''We knew we had orders,'' said Mary Hutton, one of its three
directors. ''We guessed we would be able to buy the machinery from the
closure.
''Employee Ownership Scotland pointed us in the right direction,
assisted us in business meetings and they were there almost on a weekly
basis as well as being on the end of a phone.''
Morrison pointed to two other areas where employee-ownership might
provide particular benefits. ''Communities which lack access to a full
range of local services can fill the gaps by encouraging employee-owned
businesses,'' he said.
The benefits of scale associated with larger businesses can often be
matched by economies of scope in smaller, more flexible enterprises.
''Relieved of the need to provide external dividends and with a more
frugal approach to overheads, the local employee-owned business can be
profitable as well as benefiting its customers. In areas of economic
deprivation employee ownership may be the only means of providing
certain commercial services.''
The other area could be more problematic. ''Established companies
disposing of ancillary business or outsourcing services would do well to
consider employee ownership but only where the existing operation is
conducted by a close-knit, well-motivated team.
''Selling the business or subcontracting its operations is bound to
involve some degree of risk where there is to be a continuing
operational relationship.''
This structure of company ownership is better developed abroad.
Finlayson said more than 90% of Japanese companies have some level of
employee ownership.
That bastion of private ownership and free enterprise, the US,
actually gives attractive tax breaks to employee-owned companies. More
than 10,000 companies there are now employee-owned.
Another of the speakers in Glasgow was American steel union official
Sam Camens who now represents the International Steelworkers of America
on the board of Republic Engineered Steels, which had been threatened
with total closure.
''We organised a leveraged buy-out costing $200m,'' he said. ''The
employees put in $20m, or $4000 per employee, which went into a fund
they could not take the money out of.''
The working patterns were reorganised, with a switch to team-working,
and long-term business planning introduced. That was in October 1989.
''We have employed a couple of hundred more people since then,'' said
Camens. ''We bought two defunct plants. We had a shortage of equipment
-- there had been no capital investment in 27 years. In five years we
have invested nearly $250m.''
America now has established financial backers who advise unions on how
to take advantage of the employee share-ownership law and how to put
together buy-outs using loans which allow banks to write off up to half
of the profits they make against tax.
''We have completely revitalised the company,'' said Camens. ''We are
going to be the premium producer of quality steel bars in America.''
* Professional get-together: Secretaries and personal assistants from
across the UK are preparing for a Scottish training seminar, to be held
in Edinburgh's Carlton Highland Hotel on November 2. Organised by the
European Association of Professional Secretaries, it offers a forum for
them to discuss changing perceptions of their profession.
''We want to provide a network to highly qualified individuals
performing a similar role for ideas exchange and counselling,'' says
spokeswoman Linn Dickson. ''We want to promote our profession as a
profession -- because it is.''
The seminar includes discussion on how professional secretaries and
personal assistants can be an effective part of their management
teams.''We're becoming a more important part of those teams, and often
we're not trained for it,'' adds Dickson. ''This conference is about
providing training for ourselves.''
* Wielding influence: The Institute of Management will be holding two
two-day management courses within four working days next month. November
1 and 2 are the dates for its Effective Speaking to Groups course.
''Speaking to groups can be one of the most daunting duties of a
manager,'' says a spokesman, ''whether it is facing groups of 250 or
more at home or overseas, or addressing small groups of colleagues,
board members or clients.''
Two days later a two-day workshop opens, called The Influential
Manager. ''Managers must influence people -- and it helps if they can
make friends at the same time. This skill -- to be assertive without
appearing to dominate others --does not necessarily come naturally.''

THE debt burden at Hearts has risen to #5m, according to the club's
annual report, which shows the Tynecastele side made an operating profit
of #469,000 for the year ended May 31.
Chairman Chris Robinson, however, remains confident the club's
fortunes can be turned around, and said the board was ''considering
various options to restructure the club's debt.''
Presenting his first annual report, Robinson said: ''The year under
review was very much one of transition, with the new board assessing the
state of the company and its management.
''It became apparent very early that there were major weaknesses in
financial management and, with the assistance of our auditors,
significant changes were made, including the appointment of Sally
Robinson to oversee finance and administration.
''As shown in the balance sheet, the club's borrowing is a
considerable burden,'' Robinson said. ''The board are, however,
considering various options to restructure the club's debt and allow a
more flexible approach to achieving the objectives of our business
plan.''
The surplus for the last financial year was due to the selling of
players, with a profit of #875,000 made on transfers.
Meanwhile, Alan Lawrence, the Hearts striker, could be in trouble with
the SFA following referee supervisor Kenny Hope's report on an incident
involving the player during Saturday's premier division match against
Rangers, where Lawrence is alleged to have elbowed Craig Moore.
The incident was missed by match officials, but after Hope's report
was received by the SFA, an official said that after comments from
Hearts and Lawrence, the matter will be placed before the disciplinary
committee.
This is the same procedure followed by the SFA on the now notorious
Duncan Ferguson incident.
They also may face problems over Sean Sweeney's clash with Morten
Weighorst in the McDiarmid Park semi-final in Wednesday.

DAVID Murray, the Rangers chairman, yesterday announced to a thousand
of the club's shareholders that he has already banked #7.5m from a new
kit deal he has signed with Nike.
That helped the Ibrox club's annual meeting become another triumphal
occasion for the board and manager Walter Smith, who might have expected
criticism following defeats from Juventus and Aberdeen in successive
midweeks.
Instead, Smith was applauded by the audience in the Glasgow Royal
Concert Hall as he answered questions which were put to him during the
hour-and-a-quarter meeting.
The news of the strips deal came towards the end of the
question-and-answer session which followed the official business of the
meeting. ''We will generate 40% more business in the coming year because
of this Nike deal and other business aspects we are working on,'' said
Murray.
''We have a year to go on our strips' deal with Adidas, but we have
concluded this new agreement with Nike, and I can tell you the club have
already received #7.5m of the cash involved -- which is, in fact, half
the total amount.
''What that means is that we have paid for all the new players we have
bought in the summer and can continue to look for others to strengthen
the team.''
Essentially, Murray is correct, once you add the transfer fees that
Rangers will receive for Basile Boli and Mark Hateley, and put that
alongside the fresh sponsorship cash. That will total more than #10m,
which is just about what Rangers spent in the summer to bring in Paul
Gasoigne, Stephen Wright, Gordan Petric, and Oleg Salenko.
On top of that the club can count on the Champions' League revenue --
around #5m -- which they did not have last season.
But while some of the fans were concerned with the financial position
-- which now looks better than any of the country's other top clubs --
others were worrying over team problems.
Smith was the man who answered these worries, and, who was praised as
the best manager in the country by one shareholder as he made his point.
Smith spoke on a variety of topics and he did so thus:
On the differences between Rangers and Juventus -- ''There was a time
when Italian clubs sent coaches over here to study our training methods.
They decided then that we do not have the same athleticism as other
nations because, basically, we are a nation of small people. There is
not much we can do about that.
''But we are now getting to the stage when we will have to go over
there and take a look at what they have been doing in the past few
years.
That is the way forward for us and we shall do that. I spoke to Alex
Ferguson recently and he has sent Brian Kidd to look at AC Milan. If we
can learn then we shall do that.
''But players' attitudes have to change, too. If we are paying them
the same kind of money as players on the Continent, then they must show
the same dedication as Italian players. Or German players. Or whatever .
. .
''But we have always had an attitude here that you work all week and
on Friday and Saturday nights you go out for a few drinks, and players
are no different from anyone else. They do the same -- but maybe we will
have to ask for something different.''
On Paul Gascoigne: ''We have spoken to Paul about the problems we have
up here where he might find himself being booked for something which
would not cause him a problem elsewhere. But we do know, too, that in
terms of temperament, we have to accept what Paul Gascoigne is. When you
have players of great ability then you have worries over their
temperament. Not just Paul Gascoigne, but any talented player. There is
always a downside. But we have spoken to him and he has accepted what we
have said and I believe that this will become less of a worry.
''You must remember the spotlight on and off the field he has been
under. It has been considerable.''
On injuries: ''We have examined this in great depth with our medical
people and with specialists, and they have reached the conclusion that
players at this club, because of the demands placed on them, are more
liable to stress injuries.
''They will suffer wear and tear and the experts say that it would be
unusual if a player can be here, playing week after week in all the
major games for a period of maybe three years, and not have an injury
problem.''
On the youth policy: ''We have had some young players come through but
we have to be careful. Look, we can push through a bunch of youngsters
as Manchester United have done and then take a season off from winning
the title as they have done. Or, maybe a couple of seasons off until the
youngsters mature.
''They can do that. But what would you say if I said we would take
time off from a title victory? It is different at Ibrox. We have to keep
on winning.''
On training: ''We need to have more practice time but with the number
of games we play we cannot do that for lenghty periods of the season.
But players must put in extra time no matter how experienced they may
be.''
As for the future, vice-chairman Donald Findlay ruled out any hopes of
a Britsh League. Said Findlay: ''That will not happen because the home
associations do not want it. But there will be a European League, a
natural growth from the Champions' League, and we will be playing in
that. That is where we want to be.''
Findlay seemed obsessed with overtaking Celtic's nine-in-a-row title
record. ''It's gonna be 10 in a row,'' he said, and the punters enjoyed
that.

MANAGER Roy Aitken will order an Old Firm double tomorrow to underline
that Aberdeen are back as serious championship contenders.
There will be no emotional return to Parkhead for the man who led the
club to numerous success -- only a single-minded determination to drive
the Dons back to the top.
Aitken realises it will be difficult to achieve the victory he seeks,
because he epects Celtic to be major players in the title race. But he
insisted: ''We have had a good week by reaching the Coca-Cola Cup final,
but beating Celtic would make it a great one for us.''
* CELTIC have failed in attempt to open a 3000-seater temporary stand
at Parkhead for tomorrow's game against Aberdeen.
The 1200 fans who bought tickets for the structure will be given free
entry to next week's European Cup-winners' Cup return against Paris St
Germain as a sweetener.
* THE 72 Football League clubs in England will meet soon to vote on
#120m FA television deal. The authorities down south, who have assembled
a #250m five-year package with Sky, BBC and ITV, had given the clubs
until yesterday afternoon to decide whether or not they wanted to pursue
the deal.
However, though it offers more than double what they receive under
their current ITV deal, the Endsleigh clubs want more time to consider
the details and an alternative offer from the Premier League.

THANKFULLY, Scottish sport has a good supply of world class performers
and the list keeps getting longer. Graeme Obree, David Coulthard,
Stephen Hendry, Gary Jacobs, Gavin Hastings, and last week's winning
golfers all come to mind as recent examples of Scottish sporting heroes
who have made us all feel proud.
Drawn from a variety of sports, they have one thing in common -- they
have been dedicated enough to find sufficient motivation within
themselves to do whatever was needed to reach the top.
Sadly most sports in Scotland do not have structures in place to
identify world class talent early, or to develop it sufficiently well to
reach the top levels. Also, even the most fervent patriot would have to
admit that the Scottish climate does not lend itself to good,
high-quality training. As a result, the majority of top-class performers
have been forced to learn their craft away from Scotland.
In my own case, I spent 10 years in the pressure cooker of the British
rowing squad's system in England before finally breaking through. I
should also place on record that, when the crunch came as I was pursuing
my first world title in 1993, and living virtually penniless in London,
it was to the Scottish Amateur Rowing Association that I successfully
turned for vital support that allowed me to fulfil my dream.
Now, I am in a much more secure position as a direct result of more
Scottish support, this time from Walter Scott and his Edinburgh fund
managers' company, who have made my last two successful world campaigns
straightforward and who have helped many other members of Scottish sport
as well. I also have backing from the Sports Aid Foundation.
So many times the dedicated performers and backers in Scottish sport
have shown that the heart is there for the nation to keep producing
champions, but despite all of our best efforts, there is nothing we can
do about the Scottish weather. While recognising that as a handicap --
and any rower who has stood at Strathclyde Park watching the wind
whipping up the waves will know exactly what I mean -- I believe we
should turn a disadvantage into a positive asset. Why don't we build a
Scottish Indoor Water Sports Academy of Excellence?
Now, before dismissing this scheme, give it a moment's thought. Anyone
who has been to the Centre Parcs theme resort will know that it is
already possible to build large-scale water sports areas indoors,
although I readily admit no-one has yet done so to the size required for
this centre of excellence.
The vast majority of water sports practised in Scotland -- canoeing,
small boat sailing, windsurfing, and many other forms of boating as well
as rowing -- would benefit enormously from being able to take place in
controlled, predictable weather conditions. So, too, would triathlon. In
the case of rowing and canoeing the ideal conditions would be warm and
flat calm, while the ability to practise other water sports in
controlled wind and wave conditions would be of enormous benefit. This
ability to guarantee conditions would also make such a venue a
front-runner for international competition. In rowing, most world
championships in the past decade have been temporarily postponed or made
unfair by poor weather conditions.
So, having established both the feasibility and desirability of
building an indoor Aquatic Academy, the big questions are: how much and
who is going to pay?
My own informal research shows that such a construction is feasible
but could cost as much as #100m. Given the will and effort, the lion's
share of this funding could come from the National Lottery's Millennium
Fund.
The private sector could be persuaded to invest in a complex including
shopping malls, which would generate revenue through regular usage as
the venue for large-scale classical and rock concerts with a unique,
dramatic backdrop. The guarantee of being able to use the venue for top
sporting events would put it firmly on the world map, and also attract
hassle-free television coverage, again helping to pay for the venue's
very existence.
In this one ambitious move, Scottish sport could take a giant leap
into the next century and help ensure that there will be a future
generation of champions to follow today's heroes.

New-business variety is the spice of rejuvenation for
Lanarkshire after all that gloom and doom, writes Joan Grady.
SCOTLAND has had its share of employment blackspots but they are not
necessarily doomed to permanent depression. One of the country's worst
affected areas has become a centre of recruitment activity.
Between 1987 and 1994, Lanarkshire suffered a series of high-profile
closures which led to more than 13,000 job losses. In 1992 the closure
of Ravenscraig seemed to spell economic ruin for the area.
Now companies have been moving back to Lanarkshire, bringing new jobs
and new industries. The creation of Lanarkshire Enterprise Zone -- nine
industrial sites and 500 acres of industrial development land -- has
brought a steady stream of investment into the area.
''I have been a councillor for many years and in that time I have seen
many changes,'' says Motherwell Provost William Wilson, ''but none so
dramatic as the changes which have taken place in the district in the
last four years.
''The new companies and industries which have moved on to our business
parks and industrial sites bring with them a range of opportunities for
the young people of the district.''
Strathclyde Business Park, part of the Enterprise Zone, was among the
first to open and is now home to 50 companies which between them employ
1000 people. It represents a huge proportion of the investment going
into the Lanarkshire economy.
The development of Strathclyde Business Park was given a boost by
British Steel when it bought up and developed four acres of the site
into a #3.5m centre for small businesses. Seventy businesses are now
based there.
The most successful park so far has been at Tannochside. When
Caterpillar closed its plant there in the mid-eighties, it killed off
most people's hopes for the area. Several million pounds of
private-sector investment later, Tannochside had a new retail
development and 400 new private houses.
Public sector investment secured the Caterpillar plant for
redevelopment and a new 80-acre industrial park was launched, within the
Lanarkshire Enterprise Zone, in February 1993. Since then the park has
flourished, attracting #18m of private sector investment.
Kwik-Fit has chosen Tannochside to launch a new insurance business
which will create 250 new jobs -- a figure expected to double in the
next two years.
Other businesses coming in include Boots the Chemist, Mercury
Communications, and Levi Strauss (UK) Ltd. Levi has always been based in
Lanarkshire, but relocated from Bothwell to Bellshill Industrial Estate
because it needed larger premises.
All its recruitment is done locally. ''We take people from across the
board,'' says production manager George Johnstone. ''We have a diverse
work group and age group. Sometimes we need skilled workers, but mostly
we recruit unskilled people and train them.''
In total, Lanarkshire Enterprise Zone attracted inward investment from
the private sector worth more than #50m and a total of 2200 jobs has
been or will be created as a result. But it doesn't end there.
Initiatives are under way to improve the transport infrastructure of
the region, to provide more housing, to attract more businesses, and to
help existing businesses grow.
''For long-term survival we are looking at diversification,'' says
Motherwell Councillor Jim Robertson. ''Growing small into large
companies is part of that strategy, making unemployed people
self-employed. Never again will we become dependent on a single industry
for employment.''
The region is gaining strength. In 1991/1992 Lanarkshire's exports
made #428m. In 1993/1994 that figure had risen to #584m. More than 300
new business ventures have been set up this year, and trade missions and
exhibitions helped to raise #4.5m of new business for local firms.
Existing business parks continue to attract outside investment and to
provide accommodation for the new businesses springing up. And plans to
transform the Ravenscraig site into a 1000-acre mixed use park offer the
scope for more of the same.
A partnership between Motherwell District Council, Strathclyde
Regional Council, Lanarkshire Development Agency and British Steel aims
to transform the abandoned steelworks into an all-new business park,
complete with water attraction and private housing.
The development of the Ravenscraig site has been held up by the
extensive contamination caused by 30 years of steel-making and the legal
wrangling over who is responsible for the clean-up. In the end, British
Steel agreed to take responsibility for the demolition and
decontamination of the 80 acres where the steelworks stood.
This will be a lengthy and expensive process. ''It has taken two years
to identify the level of contamination and form a strategy for it,''
says Stephen Hanson, property executive at the Lanarkshire Development
Agency.
''Much of it will be disposed of in landfills, which could cost as
much as #20m -- and with the new landfill levy, it could be almost
double that.
''There will be a landfill north of the site which will take two years
to develop to the best environmental standards available today. An
independent assessment showed this to be the best practical
environmental option.''
Parts of Ravenscraig's sprawling 1000 acres are still greenfield.
Development work will begin there while demolition of the steelworks and
decontamination of the site where it stood is going on.
It is hoped that the site's location next to Scotland's main road
links to the east, west and south, and the fact that Mossend --
Scotland's rail link with the Channel Tunnel and Europe -- is only three
kilometres to the north will be an added incentive to potential
investors.
The development is being undertaken by the Motherwell Partnership:
Motherwell District Council, British Steel, Strathclyde Regional
Council, and Scottish Enterprise.
''The Motherwell Partnership is an example of what can be achieved
when a group of individuals and organisations get together with a single
purpose and achieve common goals,'' says Provost Wilson.
''It's not about patting ourselves on the back and saying 'haven't we
done well?'. We have done well, but we have a long way to go and there
is no room to relax.''

MG cars have been built in several different locations during the
marque's 70 years and more on the road. The original Morris-based types
were built in Oxford, the MG name coming from the Morris Garages
subsidiary of the manufacturing company owned by William Morris, later
Lord Nuffield.
Lively demand meant that production moved to increasingly larger
premises, before the MG Car Company was formed as a separate entity. In
1929 it flitted to Abingdon, the MG's spiritual home as far as
generations of owners have been concerned.
Abingdon made other cars but went out of production in 1980 when the
MGB line closed. The limited-production RV8, a 1992 ''heritage'' version
of the MGB with a Rover V8 engine, was produced at Rover's Cowley plant.
MG has moved again to produce the MGF, which is built at Longbridge,
on a line which also assembles the Rover 200 Coupe and Cabriolet, and
the 400 Tourer. Body panels come from Coventry, and are treated in a #42
million state of the art paintshop before being mated with the car's
mechanical elements and trim, and the tight-fitting hood engineered in
Italy by Pininfarina.

THE Motherwell Partnership wants to ensure that the young people of
the area understand what could be on offer to them, writes JOAN GRADY.
At a conference in Motherwell earlier this month, it explained its plan
to more than 350 senior school pupils.
''It all seems interesting,'' said Lisa-Marie Lynas (above right), a
sixth-year pupil at St Aidan's secondary, Wishaw. ''You never think
they're going to do anything with the waste sites, but they are. It just
takes so long it seems as like nothing's happening.''
Most of the young people present were enthusiastic about the changes.
At the start of the day many seemed mystified by the longer speeches of
the councillors and executives, but the appearance of Chartbite's Ewan
McLeod captured their attention.
''There are no opportunities in Motherwell if you believe what you see
on the news,'' he told them. ''You could live in Motherwell all your
life and not know that Ravenscraig, while it is contaminated, is not as
bad as you think or that many new industries are coming here.''
One of the proposed developments for Ravenscraig is a new university
college from the University of St Andrews. Until now, the lack of a
university in Motherwell district has sent many of its young people
elsewhere.
''It'll be good to have the university,'' said Lynsay McInally (above
left), also in her final year at St Aidan's. ''We've got colleges but
not a good university of our own.''
The young delegates were encouraged by the plans for Ravenscraig. ''I
didn't think there were as many opportunities as there are,'' said
Lisa-Marie. ''If they do everything they say they're going to do young
people in Motherwell should find work.''

FIFE Flyers new player-coach Mark Morrison last night urged fans to do
a Braveheart to help put Benson &amp; Hedges Cup favourites Sheffield
Steelers to the sword.
Morrison, who took charge on Wednesday after the sacking of Canadian
Ronnie Plumb, has appealed to supporters to turn up in droves
brandishing Scottish flags and to copy Mel Gibson by painting their
faces with Scottish colours.
Morrison said: ''The fans have a big part to play. We're Scotland's
last hopes in the competition so we want a really hot atmosphere.''
The new-coach realises that Fife can't match Sheffield's firepower and
has ordered his troops to shut up shop at the back in tomorrow's
televised (Sky) semi-final, first-leg, at Kirkcaldy.
The second leg is at Sheffield on November 4.

MILLWALL must explain to the Football Association how a fan was able
to threaten Sheffield Wednesday's Kevin Pressman on the New Den pitch
during last night's Coca-Cola Cup tie. The FA confirmed yesterday they
will investigate the incident in which a fan allegedly confronted the
startled keeper with a death threat.
''We will be in touch with Millwall as a matter of course for their
views,'' said a Lancaster Gate spokesman. ''Clearly we will also study
the referee's report. Only then will we decide the correct course of
action.''
If Millwall are found guilty of insufficient crowd control, they would
face serious consequences. The club are operating under the shadow of a
suspended #100,000 fine and an order to play two matches behind closed
doors. This was imposed by the FA after Derby keeper Martin Taylor was
attacked during a New Den play-off match in May 1994.
In August, Millwall escaped any FA punishment when they banned for
life a fan who threw a spanner on the pitch at Reading. This time the FA
may be less lenient if Millwall cannot satisfy them that they took all
necessary safety precautions.
The South London club have made great efforts recently to improve one
of the worst hooliganism records of any professional club.
As keeper Pressman said: ''You always get a mindless minority that are
a problem. It doesn't do the image of a club any good.'' Pressman
claimed the fan told him ''You are a dead man. You won't get out of this
ground alive'' before he was dragged away by police.
Later, another fan attempted to get on the pitch, but stewards quickly
grabbed him and hustled him away.

DUNDEE spent yesterday basking in the warm afterglow of unaccustomed
success after the win over Airdrie had catapulted them into the final of
the Coca-Cola Cup against Aberdeen at the end of next month.
When it had all begun to sink in, the Dens Park directors realised
that, suddenly, the cash restraints which had been placed on them for so
long had almost gone and that they faced a new era for the club who had,
for too long, fallen on hard times.
One of the priorities for the directors is to hand player-manager Jim
Duffy a lengthy contract to remain in charge.
Vice-chairman Malcolm Reid told me last night: ''The most encouraging
thing we have heard so far today is Jim talking about setting up a youth
programme because that tells us that he wants to stay here. He wants to
complete the job he has started.
''Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to have Jim sign a
contract with the club. At the moment he does not have that kind of deal
but we want him to stay and we will try to persuade him to commit
himself to this club.
''We want to keep our best players too, but we are realistic enough to
know that you cannot hold on to players who may want to leave. What we
really need is to keep Jim Duffy here.
''He has been outstanding for this club. He looks after the
youngsters, he looks after the first team, he still plays, and he wheels
and deals in the transfer market. He is one of the first people in here
in the morning and one of the last to leave at night. We know his value
. . .''
Duffy, indeed, has been immense. But, so too have the Dundee directors
who have been left to get on with running the club for the past year
without any aid or succour from owner Ron Dixon. The Canadian
millionaire has not been in touch for almost a year.
Yet now the Dens Park side are looking at a whole new future because
of their Coca-Cola Cup exploits.
Reid said yesterday: ''We don't know exactly what we will earn, but it
is in the region of #300,000 which is a great deal of money for this
club. This could be a new dawn. I am not exaggerating about that. We
have had years and years of worry, years and years trying to keep the
club afloat, and now we are seeing the rewards of perseverance.
''But we know that we need more. We all see that and we will be aiming
to build on this. For those of us who remember the great days at Dens
this is so important.''
Duffy, of course, will look towards improving his first division
performances. They know on Tayside that promotion means more than any
brief cup glory.
For the meantime, as Duffy insists to his players that they must not
lower their standards in their league games, he also knows that they
must enjoy the moment.
How long they can hold on to winger Neil McCann is another matter and
one that the directors will eventually have to address. His goal against
Airdrie will add several hundred thousand pounds to last season's asking
price.
Dundee may not be able to resist that from McCann's many admirers and
if the right offer arrives then they may be forced to accept.
In any case the board -- without an on-site chairman -- have their
priorities right. Jim Duffy is the man they must keep.
* CHALLENGE Cup finalists Dundee United and Stenhousemuir both will be
in action next midweek, just five days before they face each other at
McDiarmid Park.
Their league matches, due on Saturday week, have both been brought
forward to next Tuesday. Dundee United will face Clydebank in the first
division, while Stenhousemuir have a difficult task against Berwick in
the second division.
* INJURED defender Janne Makela has returned home for treatment to
Finland. St Mirren brought over the international full back for a trial
period, but he lasted only 30 minutes on his debut against Airdrie on
Saturday, before suffering knee ligament damage.
St Mirren manager Jimmy Bone said yesterday: ''Janne is out for six
weeks so it was decided that it would be better for him to be at home
while recovering. When he is fit he will be back.''

MEN'S HOCKEY
ALTHOUGH Grange have still to capture the dynamic form which swept
them to the first division title last spring, they are still very much
the team in command this season, but their visit tomorrow to Torbrex
Wanderers could have a vital bearing on the destination of the title.
They take a two-point advantage to Tayside and, with second-place
Western free from competition, they can move five points clear by
registering their sixth victory in seven starts.
But matters might not be so simple. Wanderers have been something of a
problem for Grange over the seasons and the Edinburgh men have regularly
left for home empty-handed.
Current form, however, points to a victory for Grange. Wanderers have
lost their last two games on the road and this could be their last stand
in the championship stakes.
Menzieshill will face Insights Inverleith without Bruce Cuthill, who
has picked up his first suspension in 25 years in the sport with four
yellow cards. In his absense, 'Hill could struggle to maintain their
recent good form.
David Magee, on matrimonial leave, Gordon Moore and Billy Anderson,
both suspended, will all miss Ciba Kelburne's visit to Pender
Uddingston. The unavailibility of this trio should not have a bearing on
the result, but it could curtail the Paisley men's scoring prowess.
David Braithwate will be in goal for Touche Ross Gordonians against
Clydesdale at Countesswells. He takes over from Mark Ehlen, who is
heavily involved at present in college work. Player-coach Jimmy Cox will
be hoping a change of net-minder will also bring a change of fortune, is
side having dropped five points in their last two outings.

reaction of the German crowd as he went down 4-6, 6-1, 6-1 in the third
round.
In the sixth game of the second set, Agassi even gave up a break point
on his own serve because he was annoyed spectators had applauded a serve

DEVON Malcolm takes the field in today's four-day match at Soweto
desperate to show England they are worrying unnecessarily. He lines up
against a South Africa Invitation XI with tour manager Ray Illingworth
saying: ''Devon has got a lot of work to do.''
Illingworth stressed before this tour began that England's fastest
bowler needed to work on his action if he was to become more consistent.
But, during the first week of the trip, there have been suggestions that
Malcolm is unable -- or unwilling -- to change.
''I don't want to say too much, but we've still got a bit of a problem
at the moment,'' said Illingworth. ''We want Devon to be making a big
effort now, because there are only three matches before the first
Test.''
It could be that England are simply trying to fire up their sometimes
too gentle giant so that he comes roaring in over the next four days.
But there is no doubt Illingworth believes Malcolm's habit of ''falling
away'' in the delivery stride has prevented him from producing his best
on occasions.
While the strength of any concern over Malcolm is difficult to gauge,
Mark Ramprakash's early form could not be more obvious. He has put
together quality innings of 48 and 89 not out during victories against
Oppenheimer's XI and Eastern Transvaal to reconfirm his undoubted
talent.
Now England are already looking to him to fill the troublesome No.3
spot when the Test series begins in Pretoria on November 16. Teams:
England -- Atherton (captain), Stewart, Ramprakash, Smith, Hick,
Russell, Watkinson, Illingworth, Ilott, Fraser, Malcolm.
SA Invitation XI -- Amm, Toyana, Cronje (captain), Arthur, Rhodes,
Strydom, Mazikazana, Davis, Snell, Pringle, Williams.

WOMEN'S HOCKEY
HISTORY will be made at Gussie Park tomorrow when two Dundee clubs,
Bonagrass Grove and Menzieshill, clash for the first time in the first
division of the national league.
Until quite recently the Midlands did not have the luxury of even one
representative in the top flight of the women's game. Then Grove made
their breakthrough and were followed last season by Menzieshill, and so
the sport in the region has understandably taken on a new dimension.
Grove, in losing out in the championship to Western Klick Photopoint
last season on goal difference, will be expected to take care of the
young pretenders without too much hardship, but on this occasion the
differential in the scoring ability of the sides might not be as great
as some would imagine.
After all, Grove will be without their two Great Britain
internationalists, Pauline Robertson and Susan Fraser, who embark on
their Olympic campaign on Monday and are banned from playing.
This will be a relief to Alison Christie and her Menzieshill troops,
but even with their traditional performance of grit and determination
they are unlikely to wrest a point from their more illustrious
neighbours.
Edinburgh Ladies will have the opportunity to assume the leadership of
the division on Sunday should they, in the absence of Western, beat
Heriot-Watt University at Cramond.
They too will be handicapped by the unavailability of Great Britain
representatives Rhona Simpson and Diane Renilson, but while they should
get the verdict in a low-scoring contest the prospect of a surprise
result cannot be easily overlooked.

<TEXT>
FRANZ Beckenbauer's double life as a media star and Bayern Munich
chairman is causing the German league leaders headaches as they strive
to become a power in Europe again.
The former World Cup-winning captain and coach, who works as a
commentator for two television stations as well as writing a column for
Germany's biggest newspaper, Bild, has upset players and coach Otto
Rehhagel with undiplomatic comments this week.
As a result, Bayern's preparations for tomorrow's home clash with VfB
Stuttgart have been dominated by an intense debate in the media after
Beckenbauer called the club's expensive array of stars a ''school team''
on the air.
The criticism from Beckenbauer, who seems to be losing his image as a
footballing diplomat, hit Rehhagel at a time when he already has
problems with some players who are disgruntled about spending too much
time on the bench.
Bayern have dug deep into their coffers in a bid to return the glory
days of the 1970s when they won the European Cup three seasons in a row.
In a hard-hitting interview in Bild, Rehhagel said: ''I have the
feeling I'm in a kindergarten. If we open up more of these battles we
are never going to do it . . . People talk of being like Milan but we
are acting like some village team.''
Beckenbauer is in great demand from the media who are willing to pay
him money. But popular newspapers and television do not attract readers
and viewers with diplomacy.
Bayern, who have a three-point lead at the top, need to beat former
champions Stuttgart to bring some calm into their camp. A defeat would
give second-placed champions Borussia Dortmund the chance to turn the
screws.

FOUR Scots have been given direct acceptances into next week's
Guardian Direct National championship at Telford, where Greg Rusedski
and Clare Wood are favourites for the respective singles titles.
Miles Maclagan, who lost to Jeremy Bates in last year's final, is
seeded five in the men's event thanks to his world ranking of No.190,
and should he survive a tough first-round encounter with teenager Jamie
Delgado on Tuesday, he is expected to meet third seed Tim Henman in the
last eight.
The 21-year-old Scot was forced to take a three-week break from the
ATP tour to recover from tendonitis, while Ross Matheson is hoping that
his three-week rest at the family home in Lochwinnoch will refresh him
for his opening match against Avon Nick Gould.
Matheson, whose world ranking has slipped from a career best of No.241
in July to a current 490, said: ''I hadn't had a break from the circuit
since mid June. I was mentally and physically burnt out and my results
were suffering.'' Victory for Matheson over the British No.13 would set
up a clash with defending champion Bates.
Michele Mair opens her campaign against newly-claimed Scot Philippa
Palmer, the world No.823. The 28-year-old, who is based in America, has
been allowed to make her debut in the championship because she was born
in Edinburgh and holds a British passport.
Dundee teenager Jennifer Duncan, who last year defied the odds to
reach the last 16, will have to contest this weekend's qualifying event
along with Scottish No.5 Jason Barnett and top juniors Graeme
Darlington, Johnathan Pankhurst and Nicola Payne.

THE kirk steeple in Prestonpans may be the sporting vantage point of
the day tomorrow, when the Scottish cross-country relay championships
take place from Meadowmill Sports Centre.
Best known for the runaway departure of Johnny Cope's troops before
the march of Bonnie Prince Charlie 250 years ago, Prestonpans is hosting
a national running event for the first time, with the programme of
men's, women's, and inaugural veteran championships being run over the
battlefield.
Less blood will be spilled in today's confrontation than when the
Lochaber axes, broadswords, and scythes of Charles Edward's troops gave
Cope such a rude awakening that it was noted: ''the ground was strewed
with legs, arms, hands, noses, and mutilated bodies . . . the ground
literally soaked with gore.''
All witnessed from the steeple, and reported by Alexander Carlyle,
later moderator of the General Assembly.
Lining up to do battle today will be 183 men's and 43 women's teams,
less bloodthirsty, but as committed to victory.
The yielding ground will be as damaging to road specialists as it was
to Cope's heavy cavalry, and this may blunt the cutting edge of Leslie
Deans Racing Club, who, however can field three of last year's winning
team: Davie Ross, John Robson, and Tom Hanlon.
Last year's minor medallists, Cambuslang and Shettleston, plus
Clydesdale and Spango Valley, will have to be up early to prevent a
route.
* THE advice of Dave Moorcroft, still European 5000m record holder 13
years after his world 5000m record, will be welcome this weekend at an
Aberdeen initiative launched by the Activ-8 endurance squad.
Tonight he is involved in a seminar (Cowdray Hall, 8-10pm, admission
free) which also features Olympic nutrition guru Dr Ron Maughan, and he
is coaching tomorrow and Sunday at Balgownie. Backing for the event is
by the District Council, Asda, and TSB.
But seminar chairman Mel Edwards reckons the intensifying scientific
world of sport preparation undervalues old-fashioned relentless
determination.
Former international endurance runner Edwards recalls a two-mile race
in 1964, during half-time of the Scotland v England match at Hampden.
Future Commonwealth medallist Ian McCafferty declined to watch the
second half: ''I've got to do an interval training session at 5pm.''

WITH a certainty that was quite predictable, first place after the
opening round of the Volvo Masters at Valderrama yesterday was not taken
by a member of the triumvirate vying for the 1995 European Order of
Merit title. That distinction fell to Anders Forsbrand whose 68,
three-under-par, gave him a one-stroke lead.
But the daunting nature of the 6819-yard course, some difficult pin
positions, and the lively breeze which tempered warm sunshine, were such
that although Colin Montgomerie, with 71, Sam Torrance, on 73, and
Bernhard Langer with 74, had occasionally to wrestle with their demons,
they had not much to reproach themselves for.
Torrance, narrowly leading the contest for the Harry Vardon Trophy
from his fellow Scot, with Langer some considerable distance further
behind, said: ''I'm pleased. There are only 11 players ahead of me. I
kept an eye on the progress of the two others all the way round. I'm not
ashamed of that, I was just interested.''
Montgomerie noted: ''I'm here to win the tournament and if it happens
I win the order of merit in the process, so be it. I'm playing well
enough and I love Valderrama, because it presents the same sort of
challenge as US Open and PGA courses.''
In fact, only Langer sounded less than positive. Last year's winner of
the tournament reflected on his return after a week off: ''I hit a lot
of bad shots and missed too many fairways and greens.'' But as Langer
made for the practice ground to try to put matters right before darkness
fell, he pointed out: ''I'm still only six strokes behind.''
Langer was the only one of the three who fell foul of the long
seventeenth, which, not for the first time, has been altered. Severiano
Ballesteros was involved in the re-design, although where his
responsibilities, and that of the club's, began and ended is a matter
which has become open to some dispute.
A band of rough lies across the fairway just ahead of humps and
hollows created in the driving area. A player may therefore either have
an uneven lie from which to attempt a long iron shot over water to a
shallow green, also the firmest on the course. If he is in the rough,
all he can do is lay up short of the hazard.
Among the critics were the new triumvirate. ''We have 17 holes here
that are great and one, the seventeenth, that isn't,'' Montgomerie said.
The humps were dismissed as ''sleeping camels'' by Montgomerie and
''dead elephants'' by New Zealander Michael Campbell.
The slope between the green and a lake in front was termed
''sadistic'' by Torrance.
Course owner Jaime Ortiz Patino, a Bolivian tin millionaire, said:
''We interpreted what we thought Seve wanted but we are not sure it is
exactly that and he is not here to see it.''
True, there were 15 birdies, but also a 10, two 9s, and four 7s.
Langer found the water in two but still saved par, as he had done at the
sixteenth, and was down in two at the last for a bogey. Torrance pitched
over the pond to within a foot, but Montgomerie could not chip close
enough to match that birdie.
Torrance had four birdies, double the total of his two rivals, but
dropped six strokes, Langer had five bogeys, but Montgomerie only two,
on a course where the elimination of mistakes makes a higher priority
than forcing gains and which is designed to compromise confidence and
ambition with doubt and apprehension.
All credit, therefore, to Forsbrand, the winner three weeks ago of the
last European 72-hole event, who represents the host club on the tour
and, with seven victories in the past nine years, at 34 holds the
dubious distinction of being described as the best Swedish golfer never
to have played on a Ryder Cup team.
Compared with the first round last year, when in admittedly calmer
weather 30 scores on the par of 71 and better and 11 below 70 were
returned, the respective figures yesterday were seven and two. The last
of Forsbrand's six birdies came at the seventeenth, whose 511 yards he
succeeded in devouring with a No.3 wood and a No.4 iron.
These shots gave Forsbrand his advantage over the Argentinian Jose
Coceres, whose scalps at St Andrews last week included Greg Norman and
Mark James, and who had four of his five birdies in an inward half of 33
to put him a stroke ahead of the two leading British players, Barry Lane
and Ian Woosnam.
By their own high standards, this year has been a decidedly mixed one
for both. Although Lane has been twice second and is seventh on the
money list he lost his Ryder Cup place. Woosnam after only 16 outings,
is No.92 on the list, his worst placing for 14 seasons, which he
attributes to persistently poor driving and putting.
In an inward 32 Lane eagled the 547-yard eleventh, hitting two driver
shots into the breeze 40 yards short and holing the pitch, and birdied
the seventeenth. He hit his drive 290 yards into the belt of rough and
so from No.5-iron distance Lane was forced to take a wedge and then hit
another to 10 feet.
Woosnam holed three substantial putts towards the end, including one
of 30 feet to birdie the penultimate hole and two of around 20 feet to
save par.
If Andrew Coltart had not allowed his fragile patience to be tried to
breaking point the young hero of the hour last week, round in 75, might
also have been able to save shots.

ARSENAL, at 7-2, are the new Coca-Cola Cup favourites after the
fourth-round draw became football's equivalent of Gunfight at the OK
Corral: Les Ferdinand v Robbie Fowler, Tony Yeboah v Alan Shearer.
While Kevin Keegan's steamrollering Newcastle top the bill back at his
old club, the holders Liverpool, faltering champions Blackburn will seek
their first win at Leeds for 36 years.
Just for good measure, there is a re-run of the 1993 final, Sheffield
Wednesday travelling to Highbury to meet an Arsenal side seeking a fifth
successive win over the Yorkshiremen in this competition.
QPR travel to four-times winners Aston Villa in the other
all-Premiership tie, while replays involve sides from the Midlands and
the South.
But it is the Anfield clash of the titans that headlines the last 16,
the top two in the betting meeting for the first time ever in this
competition.
It promises to be some collision. Newcastle are seeking their first
triumph in the competition, but Ferdinand scored for the eighth
consecutive game -- all victories -- in the Geordies' 4-0 win at Stoke,
while Fowler bagged his tenth of the season as Liverpool matched that
scoreline against Manchester City in taking their unbeaten run to 11
games.
The goals have dried up for Leeds' 11-goal Yeboah, but Blackburn's
irrepressible Shearer now has 14. The full draw is:
Aston Villa v QPR, Arsenal v Sheffield Wednesday, Wolves or Charlton v
Coventry, Reading or Bury v Southampton, Norwich or Bradford v Bolton or
Leicester, Leeds v Blackburn, Liverpool v Newcastle, Crystal Palace or
Middlesbrough v Birmingham or Tranmere.
Ties to be played week commencing November 27.

HARD-UP Steve James struck it lucky in Sunderland last night with a
surprise 5-3 victory over three-times champion Steve Davis in the Skoda
Grand Prix.
After having defeated one of the game's greatest names, the
34-year-old Midlander can't wait to meet world champion Stephen Hendry
tomorrow. Confident James takes on the five-times world champion over
the best of 17 frames.
''Bring on Hendry,'' declared the 34-year-old world No.26, who was the
last man to record a victory over the Scot at the world championship in
Sheffield -- away back in 1991.
''I'm not scared of him. I've beaten him over the best of 25 frames,
so the longer matches don't bother me,'' said James, who immediately
received the congratulations from his delighted dad, Gordon.
His upset of Davis is worth #16,000 and James said: ''The reason I
have been struggling for so long is that I'm skint. I have been playing
under the cosh for so long but that's all over now.''
''I feel I have come out of my bad spell as a better player,'' added
the former Cannock postman, once ranked as high as seventh in the world
but currently rated only No.50 in the provisional listings.
A diabetes complaint also hindered his career, which had threatened to
take off after his success in the 1990 Mercantile Classic, where he
defeated Australian Warren King to take the first prize.
Davis, bidding for a record fourth win in this event, tried to nullify
James's natural attacking flair with some grinding safety play.
Surprisingly, James upset the maestro at his own game, even playing on
in one frame when 97-0 adrift.
James dropped two of the first three frames but a run of 57 brought
him level at the interval. A 70 took him in front for the first time
since the opening frame and though Davis again squared the contest at
3-3, James easily grabbed the last two frames 67-14, 91-14.
Earlier, Hendry stayed on course for a #60,000 first prize with a 5-3
win over Irishman Fergal O'Brien. The Scot opened with a run of 129 --
the highest televised break so far -- but struggled to reach the winning
post after he missed a straight black for what would have been a 4-1
lead.
Today's opening semi-final features two more Scots, Alan McManus and
defending champion John Higgins, over two sessions.

US TOUR CHAMPIONSHIP
A ''RUSTY'' Nick Faldo plunged to near the tail of the field after
yesterday's opening round at the $3m US Tour Championship in Tulsa,
Oklahoma.
Faldo, who has had things over than golf on his mind lately, struggled
to a dismal six-over-par 76 in demanding, windy conditions on the
Southern Hills course.
He is tied for twenty-sixth in the field of only 30, and is a distant
eight strokes behind leader Billy Mayfair.
''Tough day,'' said Faldo, who recorded 12 pars and six bogeys. ''Few
rusty shots, few wrong clubs, that's about it.''
Faldo was closely followed, for the entire round, by a security guard
hired by the tournament to ensure that no over-zealous reporters get too
close to him.
A large contingent of English tabloid reporters are following Faldo's
every move in the wake of his separation from Gill, his wife of 10
years, but he so far has refused to discuss his personal life, and
reportedly has no intention of doing so.
Mayfair, meanwhile, bogeyed the final hole, but he could hardly
complain after a stellar two-under 68, good enough for a one-stroke lead
over Americans Payne Stewart and Brad Bryant, and Fiji's Vijay Singh.
''The course just wears you down,'' said Mayfair, who is seventh on
the US Tour money list. ''I tried mentally to prepare myself for the
wind.
''I didn't have too many long putts to save par. I kept rolling along.
I feel good about my chances.''
World No.1 Greg Norman recovered from a poor start to shoot two-over
72.
''I had a horrible day, focus-wise,'' said Norman, who slumped to four
over par after 12 holes before his late fightback.
Nick Price, who played so well to win all five of his matches for
Zimbabwe at last week's Dunhill Cup, endured a miserable day.
Playing on the course where he so convincingly won last year's US PGA
Championship, Price triple-bogeyed the ninth hole on his way to a
seven-over 77. Leading scores (US unless stated):
68 -- Billy Mayfair.
69 -- Brad Bryant, Payne Stewart, Vijay Singh (Fiji).
70 -- Justin Leonard, Bob Tway.
71 -- Woody Austin, Scott Simpson, Tom Lehman, Ernie Els (South
Africa), Mark O'Meara, Steve Elkington (Australia).
72 -- Mark Calcavecchia, Corey Pavin, Greg Norman (Australia).
Other notables: 74 -- Ben Crenshaw.  76 -- Nick Faldo (England).  77
-- Nick Price.

PERFECT, or absolute pitch, as any musician will tell you, is that
uncanny often inherited gift (Mozart had it) which enables its possessor
to name any musical note heard, or to sing any note on demand.
Pitch Perfect is a new company absolutely dedicated to keeping the
very best of musical and performing talent in Scotland, and at the same
time fulfilling a need to provide the finest entertainment for your
corporate or private celebration.
The company was formed last year by three Scottish Opera personnel who
perceived a demand for a sympathetic, well-informed agency to fix all
kinds of events -- musical and theatrical -- from classical to jazz and
ceilidh.
Lesley Boyd was company manager, Scott Cooper chorus manager and
Elaine Navickas press and publicity officer. Between them they brought
impeccable credentials to the new company, and a huge, unrivalled
contact base with which to operate, filling a special niche in the
Scottish scene.
Too many young and talented performers are forced to go South because
of lack of work. Pitch Perfect is channelling natural resources to keep
native talent in the country. The company manages all kinds of events
from large corporate entertainment parties to intimate birthday parties
or wedding celebrations.
A string quartet may be just what you require for a fiftieth birthday
party or a Golden Wedding celebration, or you may want a jazz pianist
for a cocktail party that's to go with a swing, or a flute and harp duo
for a more predictable and sedate entertainment.
You may want a jazz band or a ceilidh band for your party, and if you
don't fancy the idea of a hotel, but need something a bit more unusual,
Pitch Perfect will see to everything from the venue to the printed
cards, the flowers, the transport, the food and the entertainment --
indeed the whole package.
Pitch Perfect is introducing new as well as well-kent voices and
faces, and by liaising directly with the artists is removing an extra
layer of management.
If you want your party in a stately home, Pitch Perfect will organise
it, or if you need someone to tell spooky stories at an intimate dinner
(a recent request) Pitch Perfect will arrange it.
A series of four evenings including a Victorian entertainment
(costumed and staged), a Palm Court Evening and a ceilidh were highly
successful events commissioned by British Aerospace, while Icelandair
commissioned ceilidhs to entertain their avid Christmas shoppers.
The company is a member of the Scottish Tourist Board and the Chamber
of Commerce.

* WIGAN'S Barrie-Jon Mather has won back his place in the England
starting line-up for tomorrow's World Cup final against Australia at
Wembley. He replaces Nick Pinkney who played at No.3 in last weekend's
semi-final defeat of Wales.
Mather had played well in the Wembley success against the Aussies in
the World Cup opener nearly three weeks ago, and his inclusion in the
starting line-up is the only change to the 13 that faced Wales.
However, England coach Phil Larder has delayed naming two of his four
substitutes. The two announced were Wigan utility forward Mick Cassidy
and St Helens back row player Chris Joynt.
Jason Robinson and Andy Farrell, who picked up knocks in the Welsh
game, will be fit to face the Aussies, but Farrell will not do the goal
kicking at Wembley -- that responsibility will go to Bobbie Goulding.
England team:
Radlinski; Robinson, Mather (all Wigan), Newlove (Bradford Bulls),
Offiah (Wigan); Smith (Castleford), Goulding (St Helens); Harrison
(Halifax), Jackson (Newcastle Knights), Platt, Betts (both Auckland
Warriors, capt), Clarke (Sydney City Roosters), Farrell (Wigan).
Substitutes: Cassidy (Wigan), Joynt (St Helens). Another two to be
named.

JOCKEY Walter Swinburn yesterday gave an upbeat assessment of
Halling's chances of upsetting America's Cigar and claiming a first
Breeders' Cup Classic victory for Britain at Belmont tomorrow.
Swinburn said that his big-race mount is the one horse capable of
delivering the goods. His riding record in the Classic is not
encouraging. He finished last on Rodrigo de Triano in 1992 and seventh
for the past two years on Ezzoud.
''I've had a lot of dirt in my face,'' he said. ''But I'm very happy
with Halling. I've only ridden him twice and every time I've pressed the
button I've got an answer. I've been very fortunate to ride some truly
great horses and Halling definitely compares with them.
''I've seen videos of Cigar. But I hope I don't get too good a look at
him and that he will be looking ahead to Halling.
''The American jockeys I've spoken to about Cigar have come up with
descriptions like 'monster' and 'awesome' which he is for sure. It's
going to be tough but, if any horse can do it, it's Halling.''

ELLIOT Bunney, the Commonwealth Games sprinter and former European
junior 100 metres champion, is to leave Livingston and join Heriot's in
the pursuit of higher rugby honours.
''I will be going down to Goldenacre on Tuesday to train,'' said
Bunney. ''They approached me in the summer but I phoned them this time.
I thought it was about time I did something about it and tried hard at
rugby.''
As one man arrives on the scene, another is about to take his leave,
because it has been announced that Glasgow Southern are to lose New
Zealand prop Gavin Walsh in the new year. He has signed up for Bristol,
and will be joining them once his 120-day ''lying-over'' time has passed
in February.
Walsh, an All Black trialist, joined Southern last season as
player/coach. This season, however, Brian Gilbert and Hugh Hamilton have
taken on the coaching, and the New Zealander has been an inspiration in
Southern's progress to the top of Division 4, scoring five tries in nine
league games, a high strike-rate for a tight forward.
An Australian connection could bolster Cartha Queen's Park tomorrow
when they hope to field Callum MacGregor, a former Cartha player, who
has been playing representative rugby Down Under after having left
Scotland six years ago.
''He plays for Victoria in Australia,'' said Cartha president Alan
Irons. ''He is very talented and those who have seen him play say that
he can turn games by himself.''
West of Scotland are pleased with the younger element of their first
XV. Five will be playing for one or other of the two Scottish under-21
teams against New Zealand contemporaries next midweek.
Alan Bulloch is in the team to meet the New Zealanders at Stirling on
Monday evening, as is David Jamieson. Bulloch's elder, Gordon, is the
national under-21 team's hooker for the Wednesday match at Jedburgh, and
two of his West colleagues, Guy Perrett and David McLeish, also are in
the pack that evening.
However, the five must help West return to their winning ways when
they take on GHK at Burnbrae tomorrow. West won the Anniesland match
with their Glasgow rivals last month, but the Burnbrae club's run of
four successive Division 2 victories was stopped when they lost to
Jed-Forest six days ago.
Stirling County, the Scottish champions, keep John Gibson in an
unchanged team for the visit to Edinburgh Academicals, while Rowen
Shepherd, who has been out of rugby for the past two weeks because of
injury, returns for Melrose against Hawick at Mansfield Park, just in
time to advance his claim to succeed Gavin Hastings as Scotland's full
back.
To accommodate Shepherd at full back, Melrose have switched Derek Bain
to centre, with Jimmy Turnbull standing down.
Scott Hastings, another full-back candidate though a centre with long
international experience, also makes a timely return for Watsonians
against Heriot's at Myreside. So does Duncan Hodge, Watsonians' young
stand-off who is hoping for a recall to the Scotland ''A'' team to meet
the Samoans at Hawick two weeks on Sunday.
* LONDON Scottish president Cameron Boyle is to meet his Blackheath
counterpart today for further talks about the incident during last
weekend's game between the two sides which left the Exiles' fly-half
John Steele with a badly fractured jaw.
London Scottish secretary John Smith said the club had sent their
video recording of the game, which they claim shows Steele being
assaulted, to Blackheath and they hoped that the club would take action
against the player concerned.

Some buy them for status; others for safety, says Graham Browne.
FOR some, the sleek lines of the MPV are just a little too smooth.
Offer one to the bull-bar brigade and you wouldn't see them for dust.
The 4x4 manufacturers don't offer optional (in most cases essential)
''macho packs'' -- bull bars, alloy wheels, white-script tyres, side
stickers, and chunky rubbing strips -- for nothing: they know they are
an indispensable part of the 4x4 cult.
Status comes into it too. City dwellers like the image that the
countryside is their weekend playground.
Of course there are those who buy four-wheel-drive vehicles for
reasons other than their egos -- and in fact the bulk of buyers choose
them for their security, safety, rugged dependability, towing power, and
family-carrying capacity.
Sales of on-off roadsters -- pioneered two decades ago by a handful of
manufacturers as a niche market -- reached 71,103 last year, or 3.99% of
the new-car total. Their increasing popularity defies repeated warnings
that the appeal of 4x4s is set to slip.
All the big players have taken the bull bars by the horns but, as
might be expected, the original and more experienced manufacturers
continue to do best.
The off-road capability, though rarely used in practise by most
owners, provides sure-footed handling in winter driving conditions, and
the high driving position and a feeling of sheer solidity inspire a
feeling of security.
Large families will be sold on the flexibility, with the largest 4x4s
boasting up to seven seats when required and large load capacities with
the rear seats folded away or removed.
Market heavyweights include Land Rover with its heavy-duty Defender,
top-selling Discovery (now revamped with a bigger all-new model planned
for 1997), prestigious second-generation Range Rover, and innovative new
''baby'' Land Rover due for launch in autumn 1996. The company
dominates, accounting for 40% of total sales, and continues to make
ground despite fierce competition from a score of rivals.
Mitsubishi weighs in with its muscular Range Rover rival and Caravan
Club all-terrain tow-car of the year, the Shogun; and Vauxhall, with the
Frontera and Monterey (an upmarket version of the Isuzu Trooper, both
Isuzu and Vauxhall being owned by General Motors).
Hot in pursuit are the Jeep Cherokees of American manufacturer
Chrysler. Although a dated design, the Cherokee is a spacious
family-friendly 4x4 at a highly competitive price.
The middle ground is taken up by vehicles like the Ford Maverick,
new-entrant Kia's Sportage, and the newly up-graded Suzuki Vitara V6.
Then there is a whole range of smaller, trendy vehicles designed to
appeal to the younger generation or anyone out for a bit of fun.
These include the Toyota RAV4, Daihatsu's Sportrak and the all-chrome
Jeep Wrangler -- all ideal for carrying the skis to Aviemore or towing
the jet ski to Loch Lomond.

Although the company name is unfamiliar to most people, Bill Knox
reveals that 80% of homes are sure to contain its products.
DREW Samuel, managing director of the Glasgow printing firm Gavin
Watson Ltd, would be one of the first to agree that the name is almost
unknown to most people. But he believes it would be hard, if not
impossible, to find a single home in Britain that does not contain one
or maybe even several Watson products.
''Eighty per cent of what we do is printing labels, billions of labels
every year.'' he said. ''We printed ten billion last year. They are used
by the food and drinks industry and on household goods. They are on
every supermarket's shelves. It would be very hard to go into any home
without finding one of our labels somewhere.''
Established in l863 and still a proudly independent family firm, Gavin
Watson Ltd is located in Killearn Street, Possilpark, and has just
opened an additional 8OOO sq ft extension which includes the former
Askit building in Saracen Street.
The extension was part of a new #2m expansion programme, most of it
spent on some of the latest hi-tech printing equipment available in its
speciality area.
''This follows a #lm expansion programme which we carried out four
years ago,'' said Mr Samuel. ''We have a reputation -- backed by top
international trade awards -- for quality and service and skills. To
stay in the forefront, we know we have to continue to invest.''
The latest machinery to be installed in Killearn Street includes
presses by Komori from Japan and Webtron from the United States. They
are the latest acquisitions in a plant which is heavily computerised and
which has a considerable reputation as a ''one-stop shop'' operation.
''The original Gavin Watson first opened a small printing shop in
Ingram Street, Glasgow, in l863,'' said Mr Samuel. ''He specialised in
printing share certificates and documents for the securities market.''
Some five moves later, and now operated by the present owners, with
Mrs Mary Samuel as a working chairman and her husband as managing
director, the printing firm came to Killearn Street 14 years ago.
''At that time there were at least a score of other manufacturing
firms around us,'' said Mr Samuel. ''Recently we checked and found that
we are the last real manufacturing industry of any size left in
Possilpark. But we are a very healthy 'last'.
''Our growth is steady. We now have 50 employees -- double the number
when we came here -- and our turnover for the present year is estimated
at #3.5m.''
Originally an architect by profession, he brought his skills into use
in planning the layout of the new extension and also for designing
labels.
''We required to expand,'' he said in the board room where the walls
are decorated with photogaphs of prizes and certificates of merit. ''But
like everything we do, that expansion has been driven by our
self-imposed standards of quality and service.
''We are proud of being a family-owned Scottish firm producing quality
goods -- and we are also proud of having a loyal workforce which
includes many people with up to 35 years of service. We have husbands
and wives and members of their families working side by side.'' The firm
holds BS5750 and ISO 9002 quality accreditation and is regarded as one
of the unchallenged leaders in the label printing industry.
Watson-printed labels, although mainly exported attached to products,
are sent out to customers in countries as far apart as the US, Russia,
Kenya, and several European countries.
''Labels as 80% of our work are backed by our continued security work,
which includes bank cheques and giro vouchers, and by general
high-quality colour printing,'' said Mr Samuel.
''We are equipped to carry out in-house pre-press work which allows us
to keep control of a job from start to finish.''
Producing small mountains of labels daily to achieve that ten billion
a year total, the Possilpark firm manufactures wet glue labels by
lithographic printing and self-adhesive labels by flexographic printing.
Customers range from spirits companies to soft drinks and bottled water
producers, from bakeries and dairy producers to pharmaceuticals and
textiles. Most main supermarket chains are also supplied.
''We serve a market which demands high technology,'' said Andrew
Samuel. ''Our new expansion combines that first-line technology with, as
always, our parallel priorities of quality and service.''

ALTHOUGH the first orders for the new MGF sports car were taken in
June, the answer to the supply-and-demand equation is that some of those
potential customers are only now getting towards the head of the
delivery queue. So the winner of The Herald MGF competition -- full
details of which will be given in the paper tomorrow -- will be in an
enviable situation.
In the UK alone, orders for the new car were well over the 1000 mark
by mid-September, when the first independent road tests were published.
Interest is also strong abroad, notably in Japan, where the importers
say they could take a full year's production on their own, if they were
allowed to scoop up the allocation for all the MG's other markets.
That being so, it is perhaps for the best that, for the moment at
least, Rover Group will not be selling the MGF officially in the United
States -- traditionally one of its most enthusiastic markets.
Launching the MGF this year makes it an anniversary car. Although
there had been MGs before then, founder Cecil Kimber's 1925 competition
two-seater, a Gold Medal winner when driven by himself in the very tough
Land's End Trial, has become known as 'Old Number One'. It is a hallowed
exhibit in Rover's Motor Heritage Centre at Gaydon in Warwickshire.
Seeing that car at the time of the MGF press launch, which started and
finished at Gaydon, pointed up the vast difference between a stark
vintage sports car and the sophisticated mid-engined design which has
brought MG back to world-wide attention.
In the 70 years between these two cars, MG produced an amazing variety
of designs. The original production M-type Midget of 1928 had an 847cc
engine whose original power output was no more than 20bhp. Later models
were tuned to produce seven horse power more.
M-type production stopped in 1932, when it was replaced by a more up
to date but still only mildly more muscular design. And yet, in a short
time, the factory was turning out race-bred versions like the
supercharged Q-type, which produced a phenomenal 146bhp from only 750cc,
a balance between engine capacity and power which even the Grand Prix
Mercedes and Auto-Unions of the Thirties came nowhere near matching.
Raw horse power is not the theme of the MGF, which offers 120bhp in
the entry-level model priced at #15,995 and 145bhp in the VVC which has
a showroom tag of #17,995. But mechanical sophistication certainly is.
VVC stands for Rover's own patented variable valve control, which
unleashes the extra power of the VVC model. Another first for the MGF is
electrical control for the power-assisted steering, which does away with
the hisses and creaks that plague some other systems.
And the whole layout of the MGF is modern. The design team considered
a conventional front engine, rear drive scheme, as well as a front-wheel
drive option, before settling on a mid-engine layout in the style of
some far more expensive GT cars.
Sporting appearance, fine paint finish, and the heritage implicit in
the historic MG badge are other features of this up-to-the-minute sports
car. Design chief Gerry McGovern says part of his brief was to produce
an ''exhilarating'' two-seater.
Did he achieve it? Enter tomorrow's competition, and you may be the
one to find out.

LIFE is seldom dull for Laura Mackie, marketing executive at Gavin
Watson Ltd. Demand for labels is often dictated by variable seasonal
factors.
''Recently we had a rush order with no advance warning. The Bulgarian
beetroot crop had harvested early because of warm summer weather. The
order we received was for twenty million labels for bottled beetroot --
they were needed immediately and the label hadn't even been designed.''
The order was met in a matter of days, but as an example, it
underlined the way in which the Glasgow firm and its workforce is always
ready to react quickly to meet customer demands.
''We are used to meeting urgent demands for millions of labels,'' said
Laura Mackie. ''We have to match and beat fierce competition from the
rest of the UK and Europe.
''Our modern technology is a major advantage, backed as it is by our
record of quality and design awards. Our new ISDN service is already
giving us an increasing lead in the market, a lead increasing further as
more of our customers become 'wired up'.
''We also have to monitor possible future trends -- increased sales of
bottled waters, for instance, meant increased labelling demands.
''Our customers are growing and we are growing with them. As a firm we
take a pride in the way we retain our customers year after year.''
The Watson marketing programme includes a team of sales
representatives operating throughout the markets. ''It may seem strange
to the outsider that much of the making of labels depends on seasonal
factors. But then bottling and pickling depends on seasonal crops and
while experience may forecast a demand some time in early summer for
some products, the harvesting dates are what matter -- and can vary
widely.
''Other factors can vary the needs of other industries.''
Dealing with some of the largest manufacturers in food, soft and
alcoholic drinks, pharmaceuticals and electrics, the Glasgow firm is
ready to discuss needs with advanced computer users.
''We provide the same high degree of service to other customers who
take the more traditional routes,'' said Laura Mackie. ''And whatever we
agree, we always keep our promises -- the way people expect it from
Gavin Watson.''

With the Xantia estate, Citroen
has made a welcome radical
departure, says Ross Finlay
Live load: the extra-large passenger can be accommodated but a third
row of seats is not on offer
THE way to transform a saloon or hatchback into an estate is to
redesign the body from the B-pillar rearwards. In appearance terms
Citroen made a half-hearted effort with the ZX estate, but the new
Xantia estate is a styling tour de force. The in-house styling
department at Velizy has produced one of the finest-looking load
carriers on the market.
It benefits from an extended wheelbase, even if it is only a modest
amount longer than the base car. Citroen will not be offering a third
row of seats, forward or rear facing. It last provided that feature on
the CX estate, but it did not follow suit with the CX's replacement, the
XM, and has no plans to do so with the Xantia.
As on all the best estates, the Xantia's rear suspension keeps well
out of the way. That makes for a substantial load floor area, which
comes equipped with six tie-down points where a retaining net can be
fixed.
More importantly, the Xantia is the only estate car in its class whose
front-to-rear linked hydropneumatic suspension offers self-levelling as
a standard feature. It also provides driver-controlled height adjustment
and a much more supple ride over rumpled surfaces.
As well as carrying bulky loads, some vehicles of this kind are also
used as tow cars. Citroen is the only manufacturer building estates
which can be lowered by the driver, so that the tow ball is manoeuvred
directly under the appropriate socket of the trailer bar, then raised
into place, without any heaving around. The same movement, of course,
lowers the rear sill for loading.
Test routes at the press launch showed that both a two-litre petrol
model and a 1.9-litre turbo diesel, with its slightly different weight
distribution, coped easily with bumpy country lanes, and handled well
out on the open road.
The cars come with four engine options. They include a 103bhp
1.8-litre petrol unit, a 123bhp two-litre eight-valve, and an impressive
135bhp two-litre 16-valve, plus a 92bhp 1.9-litre turbo diesel.
Equipment levels are LX, SX and VSX, the last of these featuring
computer controlled Hydractive suspension. Manual and four-speed
automatic transmissions are offered in the mix of seven catalogued
models.
Prices range from a competitive #13,850 for the 1.8-litre LX manual to
#18,965 for the top-of-the range two-litre VSX automatic. Many testers
naturally favour the VSX versions, but I was comfortable enough with the
normal suspension to feel that, for a working but still sporty estate, I
would be happy with the two-litre manual  transmission SX multivalve at
#15,870.

THE dreadful weather yesterday did absolutely nothing to dent the
trade for Charolais bulls on the concluding day of the annual October
bull sale.
High prices were thin on the ground until late in the sale but as on
the previous days the underlying trend was thoroughly commercial
indicating a degree of prosperity in the beef sector.
The top price of 30,000gns came bang on five o'clock when RM Adam &amp;
Son, Newhouse of Glamis, Forfar, and James Anderson, Burnton,
Laurencekirk, made a bid of 30,000gns to secure the unplaced May 1994
Silver Joss from Dan Harman, Grove Farm, Chesham, Buckinghamshire.
Commenting on his purchase, Mr Adam said: ''It was his character,
style and size that attracted me. This bull has also got a quite an
outstanding mother.''
The joint second top price of 18,000gns came early in the sale when
Esmore Evans, Monfa, Mold, Clwyd, sold his second prize January 1994
Maerdy Jehu to Cyril Millar, Glenleary, Coleraine, Northern Ireland, and
then later on was matched when Mrs Jessie Gilchrist, who is a sister of
the well-known blackface sheep breeders Alan &amp; John Wight from Midlock,
sold her junior champion, the May 1994 Dundas Jackpot to the
recently-established herd of Gavin Russell, Barochan Estate, Renfrew.
The figure of 14,000gns proved to be the limit for no less than four
bulls. The first to hit this mark was the February 1994 fourth prize
Balmyle Jester from Bill Bruce, Balmyle, Meigle, Perth, which sold to
Neil Massie, Blelack, Dinnet, Aberdeenshire. This was followed by the
first prize April 1994 Brampton Jackofclubs from Billy Turner, Linghams,
Ripon, which sold to David Goldie, Longbridgemuir, Dumfries.
Another Brampton bull with a first prize ticket, the April 1994
Brampton Justwilliam sold at the same figure to Gilbert Crawford, County
Tyrone, with the final 14,000gns call coming from the leading
Northumberland commercial breeder, George Murray, West Horton, Wooler,
for the fifth prize May 1994 Killadeas Jack from Stewart and David
Bothwell, St Angelo, County Fermanagh.
The Ulster influence throughout the sale was considerable and Cyril
Millar saw his cracking first prize winner, the April 1994 Glenleary
Janitor sell for 11,000gns to J Burnet, Leas, Banchory, Aberdeenshire.
At the same price Billy Turner sold another of his outstanding
consignment, the first prize Brampton Jackknife to Peter and John King
from Northern Ireland, while, again at 11,000gns, Neil Massie sold his
April 1994 Blelack Jaguar to Colin Campbell, Thrunton, Alnwyck, and J
Wight &amp; Sons, Midlock, Crawford.
Wilfred and Edwin Bothwell, Foydragh, County Fermanagh, enjoyed a
great run of prices with their best being 10,000gns for the May 1994
Foydra John to H McKay, Wester Tomloan Nairn.
The final high price of the day came when Richard Tucker, Poplar
Cottage, Swansea, sold his third prize Gower Javelin at 13,000gns to
David Fattorini, Skewkirk Hall, York.
Overall 315 bulls averaged #3992.33 -- up #266 on 1994 when 294 were
sold.

There's a wider
choice and deeper
interest as motor
caravans line up
for holiday '96
The Daihatsu Hijetta: selling well to budget-conscious touring folk
Adapted from VW base model: Auto-Sleeper Talent
* MOTOR Caravan Week starts today and continues until November 5, with
dealers all over the UK taking part, writes ROSS FINLAY.
The fact that there are several new base vehicles and conversions
available means that the industry's hopes are quite high for an upturn
of business during 1996. Various recent take-overs suggest the same.
There was a delay in getting the Sevel plant which builds vans for
Peugeot, Citroen and Fiat into full production. Since the partners all
supply conversion firms, Sevel's impact on the motor caravan market is
substantial.
Autohomes, Auto-Sleepers, Compass, Swift, Devon and the other
converters use base vehicles like the Volkswagen T4 and the Ford Transit
as well as the new Peugeot, Citroen and Fiat, and the Mercedes Sprinter.
The Talbot marque has been abandoned.
Many motor caravanners seem to be trading up from the camper style,
which is built inside an existing van body, often with a high-top or
elevating roof.
There is increasing interest in the larger coach-built style. Builders
of these buy in, not a complete van, but a chassis-cab, so that they
have a much freer hand in design instead of having to work within an
already-existing structure.
Until a few weeks ago, the microvan conversion market was dormant.
However, partly as a result of pressure from the specialist press, the
Daihatsu Hijet is now available as a motor caravan called the Hijetta.
Just under 11ft long, but with its already very reasonable headroom
increased by an elevating roof, the Hijetta features the base vehicle's
sliding doors and full-size tailgate.
Conversion work is by Devon, the one-litre 47bhp engine is the same as
in the Hijet van and MPV, and at #10,995 the little Daihatsu is already
selling well to older couples keen on budget touring.

<TEXT>
Tokyo, Thursday -- Bank of England Governor Eddie George, speaking to
Japanese bankers today, put the chances of future and economic monetary
union in Europe at less than 50-50.
''I'm uncertain about whether it will happen. I certainly wouldn't
exclude it altogether. I think the chances are certainly not as good as
50-50,'' he said.
He added that the process was heavily driven by political
considerations and if these overrode economic ''realities'', it could be
''substantially destabilising'' for the whole of Europe.
''We need to be very clear that moving ahead is consistent with the
economic realities, not just at the moment in time, but looking forward
to see if these conditions are sustainable.''
The Governor also defended the Bank's decision not to prop up Barings
merchant bank. He said the Bank of England would only provide
last-resort assistance to prevent the emergence of a systemic problem,
not to prop up an individual bank. ''It depends on the overall
situation, not upon the particular institution.''
He said this was why assistance was withheld from Barings, one of the
most prestigious British banks. ''We judged that there was little risk
of contagion from its failure,'' he added.
Barings collapsed in February after Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson
ran up losses of almost $1400m in unauthorised transactions.
Speaking to Japan's Federation of Bankers' Association, Mr George said
misperceptions of Japan's financial woes are behind the rising cost of
funds for Japanese banks in global markets, the so-called ''Japan
premium''.
''I think the premium and the rising premium is based on a
misperception of the extent of the problem here,'' he said.
''I'm not blind to the fact that there are real problems affecting the
Japanese banks, but I do think those problems have been exaggerated by
the . . . lack of transparency there has been in the past and the
assumption that that is continuing,'' he said.
Bankers and analysts have said that the ''Japan premium'' is likely to
persist as a sort of vote of no-confidence in Japan's banking system and
its authorities.
The premium emerged after fears of financial instability were boosted
by by Japan's first post-war bank collapse in August and by revelations
last month that a Daiwa Bank bond trader in New York ran up $1100m in
hidden losses over 11 years.
He said said overseas perceptions of Japan's financial problems were
being exaggerated by misunderstanding. ''I think it's a problem of
perception and explanation rather than a problem of reality. Of course
there are real problems but I think they are tending to be exaggerated
outside because they are not properly understood,'' he said.
The Governor urged Japanese banks and authorities to explain
''carefully and frankly'' the complex nature of the overall financial
situation, and said the ''Japan premium'' was likely to decline over
time. -- Reuter

THIRD-quarter profit figures from ICI were at the low end of City
expectations prompting fears that the industry-wide recovery is
stalling.
The two key developments that have had an impact on the sector over
the summer have been a slowdown in demand growth in some markets and the
peaking of petrochemical prices.
The former has been due to a slowdown in consumer demand and possibly
some destocking. For ICI, the benefits of price increases have more than
offset the slowdown in volume growth.
While the rapid surge in profitability seen earlier in the year looks
unlikely to be repeated the outlook for the sector remains positive. One
major reason for this is the likelihood of continued strong growth in
demand in the fast growing economies in the Asia-Pacific region.
ICI, which has the widest geographical spread of interest of all the
major chemical groups and a healthy balance sheet, is well placed to
benefit from growth in newer emerging markets such as China. Another
positive for the sector is the fact that little new European capacity is
scheduled to come on stream in the near future which should help to at
least stabilise margins.
ICI's management has radically reshaped the business and is changing
the corporate culture, which should provide a stronger and higher
quality base for future earnings growth. Cost-cutting is likely to
remain a major factor in the group's performance.
The diverse product portfolio means that businesses such as titanium
dioxide should be able to pick up the slack which has started to appear
in the chemicals and polymers businesses.
ICI's shares have been extremely volatile. Further significant rises
are unlikely before there are tangible signs of efficiency gains from
the current programme aimed at taking #300m-#400m out of the cost base
by the end of 1997.
At this stage of the economic cycle investors are increasingly looking
to the rating of shares such as ICI to fall to a substantial discount on
potential peak earnings.
Bid fever
IT was probably too much to expect that the bid fever, led by Royal
Bank of Scotland, which had largely driven the FTSE-100 Index in recent
weeks but waned over the past few days would stay dormant for long.
This time, though, it is the composite insurance sector or rather,
specifically, Legal &amp; General which was powering ahead on speculation
that it was about to be bid for.
The favourite to make the move is National Westminster which has yet
make any major acquisition and has given no indication that it is
contemplating doing so. As one sector analyst has pointed out, it was
not an area NatWest highlighted when it announced its intention to sell
NatWest Bancorp in the US.
Both NatWest and Legal &amp; General said yesterday that they never
commented on market rumours or speculation. However, speculation is
undoubtedly the name of the game in the banking sector these days
whether or not it proves to be accurate or wide of the mark. That Legal
&amp; General is attracting somebody's interest there seems little doubt, it
could even be a German insurer just putting its toe in the water.
But there is a feeling among some bank observers that NatWest, which
has a grey image in relation to most of the other banks, does need to be
doing something. Acquiring a company such as Legal &amp; General with its
specialist characteristics in the increasingly competitive financial
services market might be just right for a new lease of life.
Magic touch
ONLY two housebuilders seem to be looking forward to improved
profitability at a time when overall sales of new houses have fallen by
around 15% since August.
One is Barratt Developments where chairman Sir Lawrie Barratt still
exercises his magic touch -- the other is the somewhat lower profile
Westbury. Barratt was able recently to show that it had raised margins
from 10.4% to 10.9% and yesterday Westbury was happily saying its
improvement had been from 8.2% to 8.9%.
The secret is that both are prepared to take on part exchange homes to
the extent that 50% and 40% respectively of sales are generated in this
way -- something that others have sniffed at in the past as being too
involved and messy as well as being a potential Spanish ulcer with the
risk of being left with unsaleable properties.
But it is an invaluable tool at present with the housing markets so
sticky. The big housebuilder can tart up a dull property through putting
in a new bathroom or kitchen while giving the whole a lick of paint all
and at minimal cost.
Yet the competition is seemingly unwilling to follow suit which does
seem a little strange as the overall costs are probably no more than the
inducements such as carpets or paid legal fees offered by others. Both
companies seem to be able to market their developments more effectively
than their peers to the extent that volumes are moving ahead. That in
part reflects the advantage of having worked through the high-priced
land acquired perhaps seven years ago.
The other reason for the enhanced profitability is that the proportion
of social or partnership housing has been reducing -- in the case of
Westbury it has effectively quit the activity which was trading at
around breakeven.
As Jeremy Lancaster, chairman of the Wolseley plumbers merchants
giant, pointed out earlier this week, even if the Government does
something to stimulate the housebuilding sector in the Budget, it will
not show through until perhaps April at the earliest.
It seems certain that there will be further offers invited for the
housebuilding subsidiaries of some of the contractors over the next few
months with further downward pressures on land prices. It looks as if
there has never been a better time to buy a house.

A COMPANY in Lanarkshire which makes ladies' knickers for Marks &amp;
Spencers, is recruiting 120 more workers to cope with rising demand.
Granby, a subsidiary of the Courtaulds textiles group, plans to take
on more sewing machine operators at its new #2.5m factory at Excelsior
Park near Wishaw, bringing the total workforce to 310.
''The new facility has allowed us to substantially increase our
capacity and we now want to recruit more than 100 full-time machinists
to fulfil new orders,'' said Granby chief executive Robert Hart.
Lanarkshire Development Agency will assist with grants for training.
Granby moved to its new plant on a business park near the former
Ravenscraig steel works from an old factory in central Wishaw in July.
Its entire production of ladies' knickers is sold to Marks &amp; Spencers.
'We produce the whole range,'' said factory manager Patrick Seagrave.
Output is expected to rise to 10 million pairs year from six million
during the next six months as the workforce is expanded.
Turnover is seen rising to #12m from #7m.
Although most of Granby's employees have traditionally been women, the
company is keen to employ more men. It has only 25 male machinists at
present.
Granby shares Exelsior Park with five smaller companies. The 39-acre
site has been developed with the help of the LDA, Motherwell District
Council and European Union grants.
It is one of nine business parks which comprise the Lanarkshire
Enterprise Zone, where more than 2000 jobs have been created there over
the last two years.

TRUSTS
IVORY &amp; Sime yesterday declared that its recently-troubled Investors
Capital Trust, the sister of its flagship British Assets investment
trust, was back on track, writes IAN McCONNELL.
Like British Assets, the #386m Investors Capital fund has undergone a
major shake-up in recent months, moving to a much less demanding yield.
As part of a revamp approved by shareholders in December, investors'
holdings were split 50-50 between income annuity shares and growth
shares, with a one-for-five issue of warrants to subscribe for further
growth shares.
This eased Investors Capital's dividend headache and it has
successfully moved down to a yield equivalent to 110% of that on its
benchmark FTSE Actuaries 350 Index, from 128% a year ago.
There was a concern that, if urgent action had not been taken to
reduce the yield, long-term capital performance would have suffered. The
emphasis is now on total return.
Outperformance of its benchmark index during its second half to
September 30 saw Investors Capital undo most of the damage done to its
electricity stocks during the first six months by regulator Professor
Stephen Littlechild.
During the 12 months to end-September, Investors Capital achieved a
net asset value total return of 18.2%, only slightly adrift of the 19%
achieved by its benchmark index. The investment objective of Investors
Capital is to produce a greater total return than the FTSE Actuaries 350
Index.
Net asset value per ''unit'', comprising one growth and one income
annuity share, advanced 13.9% to 152.85p.
* SCOTTISH Oriental Smaller Companies Trust, which raised #23.7m at
its launch in March, yesterday announced it had outperformed its
benchmark MSCI Combined Asia Free-ex Japan Index during its initial
accounting period to August 31.
Net asset value rose 8.3% to 107.2p , while the benchmark index rose
7.1%.

It was 100 years ago
tomorrow that the
first motor-car arrived
in Scotland -- and so
created the country's
first shaky motorist.
Ross Finlay relives
engineer George
Johnston's big moment.
EXACTLY 100 years ago, a Glasgow engineer called George Johnston must
have been feeling rather impatient. On the following day, October 28,
1895, there was due to be unloaded at Leith docks a Panhard car shipped
from Antwerp. When he collected it, and the accompanying barrel of
petrol, he would be the first motorist in Scotland.
It was not a matter of simply driving the car home. For one thing, he
did not know how to drive. The car was brought to Glasgow by rail,
unloaded, and then towed by horse to the family residence, Mosesfield
House, on the edge of Springburn Park.
Johnston's nephew Robert Thomson also lived at Mosesfield, and took a
keen interest in the Panhard. In March 1966 he wrote a letter to The
Glasgow Herald recalling its arrival:
''The first operation was to find out how it could be started, and
then how to control it on the road. After some degree of skill had been
achieved in the private ground around Mosesfield House, and with
permission obtained, the carriageways in Springburn Park were used,
after closing hours, to achieve additional skill.''
Someone else familiar with Johnston's car was R J Smith, the Glasgow
accountant who became the first and very long-serving secretary of the
Royal Scottish Automobile Club.
At a dinner to mark his 40th year in office, he said: ''I recall
driving with Johnston on his car through the Glasgow streets, and the
amazement and excitement of the public, at the presence of the first car
seen here.''
The RSAC preserves the original consignment note for the Panhard,
which unfortunately spells Johnston's name wrongly. Curiously enough,
the next car to be brought to Scotland was the same model of Panhard,
imported two months later by T R B Elliot of Clifton Park near
Morebattle in Roxburghshire.
These men were Scotland's first motorists, in the accepted sense of
owning four-wheeled petrol driven vehicles. Researcher Robert Grieves
has discovered that in October 1896 Elliot sold his own Panhard to
Johnston, for the sum of #110.
There is clear evidence that Johnston's original Panhard was the first
car in Scotland. But some people regard 1995 as being too late for the
centenary.
One influential statement to that effect came in a series of articles
in 1946 in Motor World magazine, by Scotland's first motoring
journalist, James MacFarlane. They were published in a booklet called
The Very Early Days, which many later writers have taken as basic source
material.
While MacFarlane admitted that he knew George Johnston only by repute,
he contradicted the October 1895 date for Johnston's first car by saying
that ''it was in the latter part of 1894 that Johnston shipped to
Scotland a Daimler dogcart''.
Similar claims have been made since then, including one which involves
Johnston buying his first car for #10 from a ''Mr Elliot of
Galashiels''. The real centenary is perhaps the time to squash them once
and for all.
Robert Thomson and R J Smith, a man personally and professionally
involved with the start of motoring in Scotland, both described the
''October 1895'' Panhard as Johnston's first car.
If Johnston was supposed to have owned a Daimler in 1894, especially
since the early Panhards used Daimler-patent engines, how was it that in
the following year he still had to figure out how to start, let alone
drive, his Panhard? Who was the mysterious Mr Elliot of Galashiels from
whom he is supposed to have bought a car earlier than October 1895? That
#10 purchase price is absurdly low, and may well have been a mistaken
recollection of the #110 which Johnston actually paid T R B Elliot in
1896.
Elliot came from Morebattle, a place even yet unfamiliar to most
people outside the Borders. A certain geographical vagueness gradually
crept into published references to him. First of all Morebattle, then
Kelso, so why not, eventually, Galashiels? And James MacFarlane's
statement was made on very flimsy grounds. A rather defensive letter
from him on this subject, written in July 1947 to A K Stevenson,
successor to R J Smith as secretary of the RSAC, survives in the club's
archives.
MacFarlane had had the information at third hand, from a named source,
who in turn got it ''through a director in Albion Motors''. Albion had
been founded in 1899 by Thomas Blackwood Murray and Norman Fulton, who
both previously worked with Johnston.
However, when MacFarlane asked his source to try for some further
information, ''he wrote that he would not like to approach again,
because he really does not know him very well''. Despite that brush-off,
MacFarlane decided to go public with the 1894 date. We can fairly safely
ignore it, and take tomorrow as the genuine 100th anniversary.
Johnston became involved with the All-British Car Company of
Bridgeton, which was a spectacular failure in 1908. Perhaps wisely, he
promptly left Scotland, and spent almost 20 years managing the affairs
of a Mexican mining concern.
Tim Amyes, of the Classic Car Collection at New Lanark, is preparing a
book on the old Scottish motor industry, based as much on the
personalities as on the vehicles involved. Johnston should play a
prominent part.
George Johnston turned up, over 80 and almost a ghost from the past,
to watch an old-car rally at the 1938 Empire Exhibition in Glasgow. He
died in Edinburgh seven years later, without ever writing the memoirs
which would certainly have told a lively tale.

AS part of the new EC-imposed system of weights and measures, we must
get used to a revised style of published fuel consumption figures,
writes ROSS FINLAY.
For the moment, of course, British motorists can continue reckoning in
miles per gallon, but the 56mph, 75mph and urban cycle returns are being
phased out.
We are now to be given, not straight fuel consumption figures at
specified speeds so that we can work things out for ourselves, but an
already-calculated mixture.
The new urban test is done with the car's engine cold. Of course, it
will still give no indication of just how horrifying -- even down to
single figures of mpg at times -- the first mile or two on a chilly
morning can be.
The ''extra urban'' figure involves an arbitrary mixture of motorway
and main road use, at different speeds, while taking into account both
braking and acceleration. Finally, there is the ''combined'' figure,
which includes proportions of the first two.
The Nissan Almera was the first car I tried whose fuel economy figures
were recorded in the new way. The 1.4-litre is supposed to give 31mpg as
an urban figure, 49.6mpg as an extra urban, and 40.9 for the combined.
By comparison, the 1.6 returns 30.4, 46.3 and 38.7.
As before, these figures only approximate what individual
privately-owned cars may return in real-life use. Their real value lies
in offering a comparison between rival makes and models, or between
different models in the same manufacturer's range.

A NEW breed record price for a Belted Galloway female was set at
Castle Douglas yesterday when an eight-year-old cow from Broadmeadows
Pedigree Livestock, Garvald, East Lothian, was sold for 4000gns.
It was bought by Kendal farmer Brian Walling on behalf of American
rancher John Jefford from Mountain Ranch, Wyoming, where he has 180
Belties and also farms in Australia and New Zealand, and will be used
for breeding through embryo transplant.
The record priced heifer was part of the Broadmeadow Belted Galloway

INVESTMENT TRUST
BAILLIE Gifford's billionaire investment trust, Scottish Mortgage,
turned in a sterling performance in its latest six months during which
it increased its exposure to the Japanese market for the first time in
four years.
Net asset value rose by 14% to 275.3p a share over the six months to
September 30. This compared with a 12.7% increase in the All Share Index
and 11.8% in the sterling value of the world index.
Out of total asset of #1188m, 52.1% was invested in UK equities
against 51.2% six months earlier. Continental equities accounted for
13.7%, down from 14.4% at March 31; the Americas, 4.8% (5.1%); Japan
5.4% (3%); Asia Pacific 11.6% (13.4%); gilts 10.9% (12%); and net
current assets 1.5% (0.9%).
Scottish Mortgage has hedged all its yen and Deutschmark assets,
mainly through borrowings in the two currencies.
Max Ward, who manages the trust, attributes its outperformance to net
gearing in a rising market, a good performance in Japan, transformed by
hedging the yen's exposure, and the strength of South-East Asia,
especially Hong Kong.
Last night he described himself as a nervous bull of the UK equity
market. The bullishness is based on the institutional cash piles being
generated by takeover bids. The nerves are down to the Budget.
Ward is scared that political pressures will persuade Kenneth Clarke,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to be too generous in his Budget at the
end of next month. ''This would be very damaging to UK financial
markets,'' he said.
A further #30m has been invested in Japanese equities, representing
the first significant addition since 1991. Baillie Gifford believes that
falling interest rates, a depreciating currency, and fiscal stimulus
have improved Japan's economic prospects. The increase in the Japanese
stake was mainly funded by #10m of sales on the Continent and #14m in
the Asia Pacific region.
Earnings have also been rising strongly. Following last year's 26.5%
increase, they were 17% higher at the halfway stage at 3.52p a share,
and the underlying prospects are said to be bright for the second half.
The strength of Scottish Mortgage's earnings is largely a function of
its hefty exposure to the gilts market. At some stage the bond portfolio
will be unwound, however.
For that reason the dividend increase does not fully reflect the rise
in earnings. The interim is being lifted by 7.1% to 1.5p. The board is
forecasting a modest increase in the final which would give shareholders
their fourteenth consecutive year of real dividend rises.

BANKING
STANDARD &amp; Poor's yesterday announced it would cut Bank of Scotland's
debt ratings on completion of the Edinburgh-based group's acquisition of
the Bank of Western Australia, writes IAN McCONNELL.
The debt-rating agency said its actions reflected its concern about
the deterioration of Bank of Scotland's capital adequacy as a result of
the Australian acquisition.
Standard &amp; Poor's will cut Bank of Scotland's long and short-term debt
ratings from AA minus to A plus.
The debt ratings of Bank of Western Australia (BankWest) will also be
cut after it is taken over.
Bank of Scotland expects its key ''Tier 1'' capital ratio, which
dictates the amount it can lend, to fall to about 6% if it achieves the
planned flotation of 49% of BankWest.
This ratio, which was boosted by a #111m Preference share issue
earlier this year, stood at 6.6% at the end of August.
Bank of Scotland is purchasing all of BankWest for #437m. It has
undertaken to float 49%, subject to the realisation of at least #202m
from this.
However, analysts believe the implicit public offer price is high and
that Bank of Scotland may well be left with considerably more than 51%
of BankWest.
If this turns out to be the case, Bank of Scotland's Tier 1 ratio
would fall towards 5.5%. Although undoubtedly on the low side, it would
still be above the international requirement of 4% and the 5% level at
which the Bank of England would require remedial action.
Bank of Scotland might issue more Preference shares if its ''Tier 1''
ratio did go as low as this.
However, Standard &amp; Poor's highlighted the sharp rise in the
proportion of preferred stock already in the ''Tier 1'' capital base,
which it said had reduced the quality of the bank's capital.
No-one at Bank of Scotland was yesterday available to comment on
Standard &amp; Poor's decision.

LANARKSHIRE BUSINESS AWARDS
A BUSINESSMAN who masterminded his firm's rise after the decline of
the steel industry has been named as Lanarkshire's Business Personality
of the Year.
David McCallum, chairman of Hamilton-based electrical engineers EJ
Stiell, aimed his firm at the twenty-first century when it dramatically
diversified after its main customer -- the steel industry -- collapsed.
Mr McCallum, whose company employs 500 people and has sales of more
than #20m, received his award at the 1995 Royal Bank of Scotland
Lanarkshire Business Awards.
The awards dinner is sponsored by Lanarkshire Development Agency,
through the Supercounty Civic Pride Campaign, The Royal Bank of
Scotland, and The Herald.
Terry Currie, LDA's director of business development, said: ''This
year's award recognises David McCallum's long-standing commitment to
Lanarkshire industry.
''His ambition and willingness to adapt to change has turned EJ Stiell
into one of Lanarkshire's most successful companies. This award is a
tribute to David McCallum who has dedicated his whole working life to
his company.''
Other presentations made at the business awards ceremony included: the
small business of the year award to The Boxshop of East Kilbride;
sub-contractor of the year award to CTS Corporation (UK) of Blantyre;
award for outstanding export performance to Terex Equipment of Newhouse;
and the Quality award to Field Packaging of East Kilbride.
Mr Currie added: ''Like previous years, we have all been extremely
impressed by the quality of the companies visited during the judging
process.
''The high calibre of the firms involved shows that Lanarkshire's
business community is indeed being revitalised and re-establishing
itself as one of the great business centres in Europe.''

PRODUCT OF THE WEEK
THE Asia-Pacific region is booming and rapid economic growth is
expected to continue for some time so that before long the people of the
area will be as wealthy as West Europeans.
However, the region's stock markets have been fairly dull for over a
year as they ran too far ahead of events in 1993 and the early months of
1994. Many new investment trusts were launched in the boom time but
interest has since flagged.
Now Schroders is trying its luck with its AsiaPacific Fund investment
trust which is currently in its offer period. It certainly appears to
have rekindled interest in the area as #105m was placed with investors
before it was offered to the public.
Schroders points out that strong economic growth is not a new feature
of the region. During the past 18 years it has seen average growth of
7.2%, compared with 2.6% in the industrialised countries.
The trust, which will exclude Japan and Australia, will be managed
using the same investment approach as Schroders' Pacific Growth unit
trust which has achieved growth of 184% since launch in 1989. In recent
years it has been in the top 10 of its peer group so has established a
sound track record. Schroders said it has 54 investment professionals
based in local offices in the region, providing research input for the
#7000m worth of funds it manages there.
The aim is to identify companies which have a competitive advantage
and whose growth potential is undervalued. Currently it likes financial,
infrastructure and domestic consumption sectors and will take large
positions in the sectors it is keen on.
The trust's pedigree is not in doubt and it should at least keep pace
with the competition but it is not clear that the stock markets it will
invest in are poised to take off again. There are also other similar
existing trusts which sell at discounts, such as Edinburgh New Tiger at
11% and Invesco Asia at 7%.

THE #9.5m acquisition of McGavigan, the Glasgow-based automotive
electronic engineers, at the turn of the year has considerably widened
both the car and telecommunications markets for Pressac.
In the 7[1/2] months to July, it brought in turnover of #11m and
profits of #1.2m to help boost overall group sales by 51% to #57.3m and
profits by 109% to #4.61m.
The advantages of the merger include being able to offer a wider range
of products as well as expanding the customer base to manufacturers such
as Renault and even to Honda in Japan and the US.
Sales of instrument cluster circuit boards and heated outside mirror
laminates such as those used by BMW helped push overseas sales ahead by
69% and account for 47% of the total. There are also considerable
indirect sales through British car exports.
Chief executive Geoff White said productivity had risen by 20% during
the year and he expected a similar advance this time round.
The telecoms side is benefiting from the requirement for higher
quality connectors with McGavigan developing an improved mobile phone
button that replaces two existing ones.
One disappointment was lighting where sales of neon products declined
20% in the UK because of falling demand from retailers unable to afford
new signage although that was made good in Far East markets.
Research and development costs doubled during the year to #845,000 and
will further increased to #1.2m in 1995-96.
Although well heeled with gearing at just 16% and falling, Pressac is
in no hurry to make further acquisitions.
The dividend total has been raised 24% to 3.5p with a 2.6p final.
Profits should improve to about #6.25m to leave the shares at 150p
trading at 14 times likely earnings.

OIL AND GAS
OIL and gas output both staged a seasonal recovery last month, but
there are signs that the underlying growth rate in production is slowing
down from the hectic pace of last year.
North Sea oil output rose by 106,000 barrels per day to 2,580,000 as
summer maintenance programmes came to an end on most North Sea oil
platforms, according to the Royal Bank of Scotland, which produces a
prestigious monthly oil and gas index.
September output was just 17,000 barrels a day, or 0.7%, higher than a
year earlier. In the first nine months production sported a year-on-year
increase of 3.1%, which the bank claimed was marginally less than
expected. Output peaked at 2,714,195 barrels in December last year.
Oil revenues are running ahead of output. In September, they rose by
8.9% to #27.7m a day, helped by higher production, the increase in the
crude oil price, and a stronger dollar. The average price of Brent crude
rose by 3.8% to $16.68. In the first nine months revenues were 7.8%
higher.
North Sea gas output increased by 26.9% in September as heating demand
increased, but was 0.7% lower than the same month last year. The poorer
performance was blamed on the warmer weather. In the first nine months,
gas output was 6.2% higher due to increased use of gas in new power
stations.
The combined oil and gas index rose by 9.1% in September, but was only
0.3% higher than a year earlier. Combined revenues gained #4.2m to
#36.7m a day.
The Royal's energy economist, Mark Shea, said: ''Speculation
concerning Iraq accepting a United Nations proposal for limited oil
exports has been depressing crude prices over the last month.
''The market has now started to look to the forthcoming Opec meeting,
scheduled for November 21, to provide a direction for prices.
Uncertainty over the outcome of this meeting is likely to prevent a
significant upturn in prices and add to volatility in the short term.''

ICI, increased its third-quarter profitability by 89% to #248m before
tax but exceptional items dragged down profitability to #216m, still a
healthy increase in last year's performance.
The exceptional items comprised the #31m costs associated with the
restructuring and integration of the paints businesses acquired in the
second quarter and #25m set aside to cover legal and litigation costs in
the US explosives business. These were offset by exceptional profits on
the sale of several businesses, including Scotoil Services.
The third-quarter profits take the total profitability for the first
nine months of the year to #758m, before tax and exceptional items, more
than double last year's comparable result. Exports from the UK rose in
the quarter by 35% to #436m.
ICI chairman Sir Ronald Hampel said the results were ''good'', noting
the strong performance of many of the businesses in what is
traditionally a quiet quarter for the group. The financial performance
continues to benefit from past and current restructuring programmes.
Margins in industrial chemicals improved helped by price increases in
some products which more than offset the easing in petrochemical prices.
Both chemicals and polymers and tioxide improved their performance and
the trading profit of the industrial chemicals division rose sharply to
#422m.
Chemicals and polymers benefited from higher selling prices, notably
in polyester. Tixoide's trading profit was significantly ahead of last
year helped mainly by higher selling prices world-wide and increased
volumes.
In materials, trading profit more than doubled to #144m with all
businesses performing well. Improved European selling prices and strong
demand earlier in the year contributed to the profit improvement.
On the negative side, paints continues to face a tough time but has
been helped by recent North American acquisitions and continued growth
in Asia. Its profits were down #10m partly because of substantial raw
material cost increases.
Trading conditions continue to be tough in Europe. The explosives
business also reported lower profits because of reduced volumes in the
highly-competitive US market.
The balance sheet strengthened in the period with interest charges
down #22m to #49m helped by a lower level of net debt. Net gearing is
just 6.8%, while capital expenditure rose by 71% to #417m.
ICI shares sank 24p to 779p with some institutional funds switching
into its smaller higher-yielding rival, Courtaulds.

VENTURE CAPITAL
BRITISH Coal is selling major venture capital group CINVen through a
management buy-out for an undisclosed sum, it was revealed yesterday.
CINVen manages about #1000m of venture capital assets for the British
Coal Pension Schemes, Railways Pension Schemes, Barclays Bank Pension
Fund, and Royal Life Insurance.
Offers for CINVen were invited on August by Samuel Montagu on behalf
of British Coal. Completion of the sale is expected to take place on
October 31. CINVen has been the UK market leader in buy-outs during the
1990s. Prominent transactions this year included Automotive Products at
#181m, Wightlink at #108m, Advance International worth #80m, Chelwood at
#63m and Corgi Classics #13m.
It was incorporated in 1987 as the venture capital arm of CIN
Management (CINMan), the pension fund management company for the Coal
Pension Schemes. In preparation for the sale of both CINVen and CINMan,
CINVen became a direct subsidiary of British Coal earlier this year.
The buy-out team comprises the 13 Investment Directors of CINVen, who
will own the business and have subscribed the equity capital. Bank
finance is being provided on a long-term basis by the Bank of Scotland.
In the short term, CINVen will remain in British Coal's London
headquarters but will move to new premises in the first half of 1996.
British Coal said all of CINVen's clients have expressed their
satisfaction with the outcome of the sales process and their
relationships with CINVen will continue following the change of
ownership.
Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, commented: ''We are very pleased
to have concluded this sale to the management team in a way which not
only satisfies British Coal's requirement to obtain best avalable terms,
but also achieves the primary objective of all CINVen's customers of
ensuring continuity of the high-quality investment service which they
enjoy at present. In addition, it will enable the existing management
and staff to develop the business in the future.''
Speaking for the British Coal Pension Schemes, Paul Trickett said:
''It has been the Coal Schemes' desire from the outset to secure
continuity of the high quality investment management service provided to
us by CINVen and to preserve the close working relationships which have
been built over many years.
The sales to the management team full achieves these objectives for
the benefit of some 500,000 current and deferred pensioners.''
The sales process for CINMan, the fund manager for the Coal Pension
Schemes' marketable securities and property investments, and the
outsourcing of the pensions administration and other activities
undertaken at Sheffield-based Centris, have both reached an advanced
stage.
Prefered bidders for the businesses comprising British Fuel
Distributors were recently announced and expressions of interest have
been invited for the activities of British Coal Enterprise.

HOUSEBUILDING
WESTBURY is one of the few housebuilders able to look forward with
some confidence to improving profitability over the next six months -- a
point recognised by the City yesterday when it marked the shares up 6p
to 161p.
A good interim had been expected from what is regarded as being one of
the very best managed housebuilders. But the confidence of chairman
Geoffrey Maddrell who last night would presumably be celebrating with a
glass of Glenmorangie whisky produced by another of his companies,
Macdonald Martin, was the inspiration for the share move.
In the six months to August, turnover rose 12% to #89.6m and pre-tax
profits by 13% to #6.51m.
There was an 8% rise in the number of houses sold to 1275 units with
there being just five social houses in comparison with the 140 units
last year. These contributed little more than recovered overheads.
The expectation is that the build in the current half will be similar
although with average prices about #2000 higher at #69,000 as the larger
houses are moved up in terms of size and fittings.
About 55% of the business is geared to the lower end of the market but
where Westbury's part exchange skills are a vital marketing tool. There
were 186 houses on the stocks at the end of August -- the intention is
to turn them over in less than 13 weeks and so it had just 14
non-movers. Their holding cost is absorbed in the overall l3.6% margin
allowed for sales incentives.
So far the sales volume has been maintained from the 81 or so sites
and chief executive-elect Martin Donohue is intent on increasing the
land bank further. With 6550 directly owned plots there is enough for
nearly three years build but he is looking forward to the sell-offs by
some of the contractors to release more land at lower prices.
Westbury is in the happy position of having low gearing which will be
below 30% at the year end with interest currently covered 5.4 times.
That gives it plenty of flexibility but it is unlikely to move outside
its existing five trading areas.
Full-year profits should improve by around #2m to just over #14m to
leave the shares trading at 11[1/2] times possible earnings. But with
the sector unlikely to do much for some time, the stock seems adequately
valued.
The dividend has been raised marginally to 2p with a 6p total probable
for a 4.6% yield.

Fred Goodwin at 37 is the youngest person to head a UK clearing bank.
FRED Goodwin, 37, will become the youngest ever chief executive of a
UK clearing bank when he succeeds Frank Cicutto as the boss of the
Clydesdale in March next year.
Mr Cicutto, 44, is going back to Australia to a top job at
Clydesdale's parent, National Australia Bank, after a two-year stint in
Scotland.
Mr Goodwin joined the Clydesdale in March from accountants Touche Ross
to be groomed as a successor to Mr Ciccutto.
The posting of the veteran Australian banker to Scotland had always
been regarded as a holding operation.
He was rushed into the Clydesdale in January 1994 to replace former
chief executive Charles Love, who died in the job a month earlier.
The Clydesdale announced yesterday that Mr Cicutti would become chief
general manager of National Australia Bank in Melbourne -- occupying one
of the top posts in the group.
A new post of deputy chief executive was created specially for Mr
Goodwin when he joined the Clydesdale earlier this year. But this will
disappear with his promotion to chief executive.
''Frank will be a hard act to follow, but I am sure the initiatives he
has implemented provide a secure foundation for the future,'' Mr Goodwin
said.
But he added that the momentum of change would continue.
Mr Cicutto presided over a restructuring of the Clydesdale that freed
up managers from branch administration to devote more time to their
client portfolios.
He also helped to set up National Australia Life, a #58m life
assurance venture, which was formally launched two weeks ago.
Although National Australia Life is headquartered in London, its main
administration staff are based in Clydesdale offices at Clydebank.
Mr Cicutto said he thought his many achievement at Clydesdale had been
to pull new younger blood into the bank's senior management, both by
internal promotion and external recruitment.
''I continued to accelerate the process of change in the bank, in
particular bringing new blood into the executive management ranks,'' he
said.
He cited as examples David Peebles, the new head of treasury, who is
only 32, Neil Roden, the 37-year-old head of human resources, and John
Berry, 44, the new head of corporate banking who was poached from Bank
of Scotland.
And of course, Mr Goodwin who will replace him.
Back in Australia Mr Cicutto's responsibilities will be vastly
increased. he takes over a network of 1300 bank branches employing
23,000 staff, that generates over $A1000m (#480m) a year in profits.
''It's about four times the size of Clydesdale in terms of branches
and people,'' he said.
Mr Goodwin, the chief executive designate, was not complete outsider
to banking when he came to the Clydesdale.
He helped do due diligence on Clydesdale for National Australia Bank
when it bought the bank from Midland in 1987 and subsequently became its
audit partner within Touche Ross.
That was the start of a relationship which regularly saw him called in
by National Australia to cast a rule over other potential acquisitions.
But as a partner of Touche Ross, Mr Goodwin also specialised in
industrial issues.
From 1985 to 1987 he led a team of management consultants that
implemented the change to contractor management at Rosyth shipyard and
in 1990 he was appointed by the Government as an executive director of
Short Brothers, the Belfast ship and plane builder, to help oversee its
privatisation.
Born in Paisley, he was educated at Glasgow University and at 37 is
the youngest person ever to become head of a UK clearing bank.
He even beats Martin Taylor, another outsider to the banking
establishment, who was 41 when he was appointed head of Barclays in
December.
Richard Coleman, banking analyst at broker Smith New Court, said Mr
Goodwin's youth and his background outside banking were symptomatic of
deep changes taking place in the UK banking industry.
''Banking is changing a lot faster now than ever before and
undoubtedly there is a tendency to not just promote up into the dead
man's shoes,'' he said.
Mr Goodwin's future number two at the Clydesdale will be Graeme
Willis, whose job title is being changed from general manager projects
to general manager banking.
The Clydesdale, the smallest of the three big Scottish banks. It has
310 branches and about 5500 employees.

SUNDAY, day of restlessness. Clouds like dirty washing hang over the

each other into the parking bays of MFI, Behar Carpet Superstore, and
the furniture emporium of Allied, Edinburgh. From the windows of their
drive-in showrooms the logos of Renault, Rover, and Volkswagen/Audi
summon new constituents to our car-owning democracy.
Gloomily I negotiate the congestion on this waterfront thoroughfare
between Leith and Portobello, where the view across the Forth to Fife
grows increasingly obstructed by the ribbon development of retail
warehouses. In any other showcase city in Europe, I brood, the coastal
boulevard of Seafield Road would be lined with restaurants and cafes;
and on fine Sundays there would be a relaxed promenade of families,
teenagers, and young lovers.
I pick up the link road to the city by-pass and pass by busy Asda,
whose newly recruited employees will henceforth receive only
time-and-a-half, instead of double time, for working Sundays. ''The thin
end of the wedge,'' say Asda's critics, anticipating the piecemeal
erosion of special rates for ''anti-social hours''. But you can see the
logic of Asda's position; as the line between the commercial life of
weekdays and the commercial life of Sundays becomes more and more
nominal, what's anti-social about working on Sundays?
Sunday in the park. Craig Park, a few revs off the by-pass, is the
late twentieth-century interpretation of a concept which, in its civic
identity, is still defined as ''a piece of ground for public
recreation''. In its own unlovely way Craig Park meets the criteria.
It is indeed a piece of ground, brutally prepared to receive the motor
car, and its opportunities for recreation are many: the thunderous
alleys of Megabowl with their supplementary hinterland of video games,
bars, and fast-food outlets, the 12 screens of UCI with their peculiar
agenda of sentimental allegory and sado-masochistic fantasy; and a host
of exotic excitements for the recreational shopper, including Toys R Us
and Pet Kingdom.
They tell me you can buy a big red parrot for two grand in Pet
Kingdom, but my own eager preference over a wet Sunday in Craig Park is
a wet month of Sundays in Saltcoats. Here by the city by-pass is hell
for hermits, purgatory for peace-lovers, mortal sin for even secular
Sabbatarians. I deposit the birthday girl and her pals at Megabowl, put
them in the care of the staff, wish them joy, and scarper.
As I grind home through the traffic there is almost a last straw. I
get stuck behind a boy racer who has wittily attached the following
message to his rear windscreen: ''If It's Too Loud You're Too Old.'' I
expect the caption is there permanently, seven days a week, and when the
weather is dry he opens his windows to permit the discharge of his
stereophonic pollution, but he makes final mock of the notion of repose
which Sundays once signified.
What a tacky business the Scottish Sabbath has become. I envy the
islanders of Lewis their seventh day, and I admire their tenacious
defence of its values. Even if you rarely spent Sunday worshipping God
its old constraints held blessings much missed by those who remember
them. With ''nothing to do'' there was giddy scope to do everything that
becomes more and more difficult to do today: get up late (no queues to
beat at the supermarket), hear the echo of your own footsteps in city
streets, explore the potential of your own resources and, more than
anything, reflect a little. Muse. Let the mind drift within the loose
structure of a low-key day.
If it's too loud then I'm too old? I don't remember finding the
Scottish Sabbath joyless, even when I was young, although I think I must
belong to a generation which hit its happy medium, somewhere short of
the more rigorous requirements of observance. I know my mother and her
sisters hated their childhood Sundays; the hours spent at church,
morning and evening, the prohibition on games, the stiff assembly of the
extended family round the piano. ''And our parents,'' they say,
''weren't even allowed to read on Sundays.''
That would certainly be hard. But when I was a child, once Sunday
School duties were performed, the day was pleasantly recreational;
outdoor activities if the weather was good, books by the fire or friends
for games if it rained and, in time, Sunday Night at the London
Palladium. I was puzzled by my mother's dislike of church bells, a
friendly sound. As a lapsed church-goer their tolling made her feel
guilty ''for not being there''.
Even as a surly teenager Sundays didn't seem too bad, and as I swung
uneasily through the sixties and seventies, never quite certain of my
place in their self-proclaimed process of liberation, the slothful
silence of Sundays was an antidote to the industrious noise of Saturday
nights. Sunday, sweet Sunday, when we slept until noon, wallowed in the
papers, walked in the park and, if we fancied rowdier amusement, turned
ourselves into ''bona fide travellers'' to qualify for drinks in the
cocktail bars of selected hotels.
I pity today's young, spoiled for choice on Sundays, toiling under an
embarrassment of recreational riches and never knowing what day of the
weekend it is. The commercial forces which want to infiltrate the last
Sabbatarian strongholds of the Hebrides make the wrong excuses. The
demand is there, they say, from the tourists; which misunderstands the
nature of the kind of tourist who reaches the Long Island, in serious
search of somewhere ''different''. This genre of tourist isn't looking
for Craig Park.
Meanwhile the Scottish city, and increasingly the English city, goes
Sunday shopping en masse to the most anti-social retail outlets -- those
which bring more and more cars on to the roads. Is it any wonder that
the British are turning into a nation of mindless consumers, whose
podgy, pasty faced children overdose on video games and junk food while
their parents shop till they drop?  If I were rich I would fly to France
for Sundays, where apart from the street markets there are only three
kinds of shop open until lunchtime: the boulangerie for fresh bread, the
patisserie for fancies for the family tea, and the fleuriste for flowers
for Maman. You are what you consume.

It's Mr Egg's mission to prove acid is much more than a musical fad.
David Belcher unscrambles the world of the dance-party rooster
Get ready for shell-shock
DESPITE his singular nom du disque and his curious penchant for all
things oviform, Mr Egg is a disarmingly down-to-earth kind of bloke. For
instance, although he's established Ege Bam Yasi as a fixture on the
big-league dance circuit -- having this year appeared everywhere from
the Phoenix Festival to Megadog's 10th birthday bash at London's Brixton
Academy -- Mr Egg is still miffed about having been denied an
opportunity to unleash his acid wares on a traditional Scottish wedding
reception, to take place tomorrow in Strathpeffer.
He sighs. ''I was looking forward to getting a business card printed:
'All functions catered for: weddings, funerals, barmitzvahs' .''
As it is, Mr Egg's function is to craft all-night dance-party music;
to continue ploughing the lone acid furrow he has done for the past 11
years. Acid: Mr Egg knows it's an unfashionable term these days. Acid:
once it was synonymous with Sun front-page teen-rave-drug-shock-horror
exposes. What does it mean today?
''Acid -- that's the music and not the drug -- is hard and sparse,
with a simplicity. Bass and drums. And noise. The smiley-face acieeed
culture of 1988 did more damage than good. Ever since, acid has been
seen as a fad.
''Acid doesn't seem to appeal on a mass level. No radio DJs play acid,
but in contrast you can hear the similar drum-and-bass format of jungle
in mainstream TV ads for British Home Stores. In the war of technology
against guitar-bands, I do what you might call acid grunge: aggressive,
in-your-face, rough.
''Acid, techno, ambient, it's all in Ege Bam Yasi. It adds up to what
I call dambient -- danceable ambient. Everything I've done has been
acid, but it's all been a progression. There's more music on my new
album, How To Boil An Egg, than people might think.
''But someone once wrote that I was acid before folk knew what to call
it. I just describe my music as being something you don't need O-levels
to enjoy.''
Mr Egg is rooted in everyday Scottishness. He was born with a plain
Scottish name in Inverness, and brought up in Stirling. He made his
musical debut in a regular guitar-band, the Mississippi Groovers, ''in a
wee room outside Dublane, playing bass badly. I'm proud to say I'll
never hold a guitar in my hands again''.
''Because in the early eighties I discovered electro . . . machines
making softer, lighter sounds, and it was love at first hear. I can't
say what it did to me. After I got sacked from work as a plumber -- I
was caught with plumbing materials in my bag -- I spent the last #80 I
had in the bank on recording a backing-tape.
''Then I got myself a gig at a club in Stirling. I got it before I
knew what I was going to do. But Frank Tovey and his band, Fad Gadget,
were big influences on me at the time. You'd have Frank out in front
being mental with a load of people behind him doing stuff in time,
hopefully, to a backing-tape.''
''Now the music's getting better and the visuals are getting more
amateurish.''
Mr Egg gestures towards an outsize papier-mache rooster-head lying in
the corner of the Leith studio, Finiflex, in which he recorded How To
Boil An Egg for the UGT label, a Finitribe offshoot.
''I'd be struggling without Finiflex,'' he continues. ''No money's
ever been put behind me. Everything I've done has always been funded by
giros. I've refused to forelock-tug to big labels. Not that there have
ever been many acid folk signed to big labels anyway.''
The strain of trying to sustain a career with so little encouragement
is starting to show.
''With all the Scottish bands I've seen come and go in the past 11
years, it's been hard to take. Maybe it's affected my psyche. Done me
in. But with a name like Ege Bam Yasi, you're always due for ridicule.
But I'm not doing it as a joke. I've got perseverance, determination.''
Let's hope it's about to pay off with Mr Egg's new album. His time may
be nigh. After all, following years of critical neglect and outright
disparagement, Can are back in favour. Mr Egg is gaining a higher
profile, too. He has re-mixed a Gary Numan single. His own last single,
Remont, sported sonic tweaks from Erasure's Vince Clarke.
But Mr Egg depends chiefly on himself, and his intuitive rhythmic
prowess. Live in clubland, Ege Bam Yasi is Mr Egg and his keyboards,
with occasional taped contributions from Queen, Gary Glitter, farmyard
cockerels or Meg Ryan (her faked orgasm in When Harry Met Sally), all of
them deployed to circumvent the awkward silences which Mr Egg regrets
you get with guitar bands.
In the further future Mr Egg envisions being the star of a computer
game -- ''Not a standard shoot-'em-up, more quest-oriented'' -- and a
kids' book. More immediately, he will next month be leaving his Easter
Road nest -- ''Easter Road . . . most suitable for Mr Egg'' -- to
undertake three Scottish gigs.
On November 11 he'll be at Ship To Shore on a floating venue, the
Boat, moored in Leith Docks. The next night he's at Karma in Edinburgh's
Venue, and at Trauma at Aberdeen University four nights later.
Get acquainted soon with the musical contents of Mr Egg's oval shaven
head. He is resolutely unscrambled.

IN his last Budget, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke announced plans for a
new landfill tax, to come into force in October 1996. The measure, he
suggested, was proof positive of the strength of the Government's
greener instincts.
On the polluter-pays principle, it would deter the tipping of waste
into holes in the ground and give a fresh impetus to efforts to recycle
more of society's detritus. It would, incidentally, raise a tidy sum of
money annually which the Government would use meaningfully elsewhere.
''My aim,'' elaborated Clarke this August, ''has always been to raise
the tax revenue I need in ways which do the least damage to the economy
. . . By raising revenue from waste disposal we will be able to make
further cuts in employers' national insurance contributions and so
create more jobs. We will tax waste more and jobs less.'' Who could
argue with that, you might think. Green and job creative in one go.
Truly a tax for all seasons.
In a follow-up consultation paper issued last March the Government
elaborated on its plans for the new tax and sought reaction from
interested parties. Originally the plan was to tax waste on an ad
valorem basis related to the actual charge for landfilling this form of
waste or that.
But, as a result of the consultation, the Chancellor decided, this
August, to charge the tax per tonne of waste deposited instead, with a
reduced tax rate for inert waste. The actual rates of landfill tax will
be announced in this November's Budget.
We can, at this stage, only speculate about what these rates might be.
But to raise the kind of money he is looking for, Kenneth Clarke could
be planning a mainstream landfill tax of around #5 a tonne. On that
scenario, those tipping inert waste -- principally the muck and rubble
generated on every construction and demolition site in the country --
could face a reduced tax rate of anything between #1 and #2.50 a tonne.
If that is the kind of money involved, the knock-on effects on the
construction and housebuilding sectors which have never properly
recovered from the last recession could be serious. The costs of
building work will rise. The tax take, to be collected by the VAT
people, Customs &amp; Excise, will further destabilise already fragile cash
flows. And far from encouraging greater efforts to recycle, the landfill
tax may lead to a proliferation of illegal fly-tipping at unlicensed
sites, doing even more damage to the environment in the process.
The kind of inert waste generated by housebuilding, construction, and
civil engineering work is, in the main, at the lower end of the
pollution scale. It does not decompose to generate methane. There is
scope for recycling the rubble, by crushing it and re-using it as
bottoming in roads and hard landscaping. But demand for that material,
needless to say, is heavily dependent on the buoyancy of the
construction sector in general and the road building programme in
particular.
By definition, a cubic metre of building muck is heavy. And heavier
still on a wet winter's day. One lorry load can weigh up to 16 tonnes.
An equivalent lorry load of household waste, potentially much more
damaging to the environment and the principal source of methane in
landfill sites, can weigh in at as little as three or four tonnes. But
both take up the same space in that hole in the ground.
Worse, because current costs for inert waste landfill in Scotland can
be as low as #1 a tonne, compared with #6 a tonne for disposal of an
identical lorry load in congested southern England, the flat-rate tax
the Chancellor now proposes will bear, in percentage terms, up to six
times as heavily in parts of Scotland as in the south. If Michael
Forsyth will forgive me, his Cabinet colleague is fashioning another
little tartan tax bombshell right under the Scottish Secretary's nose.
''It's a complete nightmare, a can of worms,'' according to W H
Malcolm, the leading Scottish transport group whose landfill and tipper
haulage division handled 3,500,000 tonnes of inert building waste last
year, 80% of it disposed of in 12 landfill sites operated in-house.
Malcolm's self-interest is undeniable. At #1 a tonne, the new tax will
whip #3.5m (plus the VAT which will be imposed on the landfill tax
charge) out of the company's cashflow before it can be recouped in
higher charges to customers or in redoubled efforts to recycle. ''But
there's very little you can do with muck in recycling terms,'' points
out finance director Ian Black.
But, despite that financial self-interest, the case against taxing
inert waste in the form currently proposed is substantial. The tax will
have a significant knock-on effect in a sector of the economy which is
already enduring tough times. And, in terms of the Chancellor's plans to
use the proceeds to cut employers' national insurance contributions,
there will be no real pay-back in construction since a large proportion
of the workforce is already self-employed, under the 714 rule.
Government officials argue that the decision to tax inert waste is
justified by the disamenity effects on the community of transporting
such waste to landfill sites. But that points not to a landfill tax on
inert waste but an amenity tax.
The trouble with Clarke's whole landfill tax proposal is that it
smacks of populist opportunism. Any serious-minded attempt to address
the pollution and other environmental impact of waste through the tax
system would have addressed all the options in a comprehensive way.
Instead the Government depends on current EU directives to control
emissions from incineration and water-borne disposal. And, while
Brussels contemplates a carbon tax to control harmful emissions,
Whitehall proposes to tax only landfill disposal in a way which fails to
discriminate effectively between waste that generates methane and waste
which does not.
Confusion reigns. In terms of solving a genuine issue in a green way,
it is the equivelent of slapping an extra tax on a bottle of Scotch
because the Commons and the country won't stand for a second-round VAT
impost on domestic fuel and power. Mr Clarke should perhaps reflect that
that little manoeuvre left him with less excise revenue than before.
The price of his landfill tax could be an even more battered
construction sector and a lot more rubbish blowing in the wind.

A MEXICAN ta ta the noo wave to T Shields, Diarist of this Parish, who
is off to sunny South America for a month. This tyro scrivener, on
asking his advice, was told to ''Kiss''. The part of the anatomy was not
specified and it was eventually explained that this is an acronym for
''Keep It Simple, Stupid''. Wilco, Tom.
Taught a lesson
LATE news in from Turin is that eight Rangers supporters caught
climbing the stadium wall are not to be charged. The police did,
however, march them back in and force them to watch the rest of the
game.
Same difference
STILL in Glasgow-twinned Turin, one of the Diary's sports colleagues
shares this tale of a restaurant which is Turin's equivalent of La
Parmigiana in Great Western Road, hang-out of Rangers players and the
like. It was filled with Juventus players and their wives, one of whom
was attempting to explain the sex of her three children to a slightly
sozzled Scottish punter, who did not understand the difference between a
bambina and a bambino. Eventually, all became clear when she explained
that she had ''two pee-up-the-wallis and one pee-in-the-panni.''
Scotch mist
DEPARTMENT of A Nation Once Again, Again: while engaged in essential
research, the Diary eye happened upon Page 3 of the ''Daily Star of
Scotland''. Nestling alongside the ''classy Claire-Louise'' was a
picture of Sean Connery, billed in the column as ''the most powerful
English actor in Hollywood''. Big Sean's opinion of this statement is
not being sought, at least not until someone braver than us volunteers.
Trad Tealeafing
IT is reassuring to learn afresh that some Scottish literary
traditions survive. At the wake on Wednesday following the cremation of
Tom Buchan, Glasgow poet and apocalyptic visionary, we were prevailed
upon to read one of Tom's poems from Forwords, a much-cherished volume
in our possession since the day of its printing.
At some stage in the proceedings, said poetry was purloined by one of
the assembled literati. Pang of conscience, whoever? Or a spare copy,
anyone?
Soapy bubble
FOR those of you who are still at a loss for those ideal Christmas
gifts, may we recommend an issue of Lush Times. No, not a periodical for
those sobriety challenged members of the community, but a bathroom
products catalogue. Among the heady delights on offer is The Fragrant
Musketeer, a shower gel with ''a gentle shampoo base and seductive
techno-musk fragrance'', perfect for grannies everywhere. Or you could
plump for a pot of the conditioner named after H'suan Wen Hua who, as
everyone knows, was the Japanese God of Hair.
For the less fragrant members of the family, you could drop a hint
with Karma, a perfume oil which is filled with ''smooth swirling notes
and synthesised bouquets. Holographic, it begins with the fiery
imaginative theme of ginger and lemongrass, this is followed by harmonic
coconutty layers that very slowly develop into the solid drumbeat of
myrrh and sandalwood''. Beats socks at any rate.
Head girl
EASTERHOUSE-born diva Terry Neason is about to be knocking them dead
tonight as Top Dog in Prisoner: Cell Block H alongside Lily Savage and
The Freak, played by actress Maggie Kilpartick, at, of course, the
Queen's Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue. We hear of an accident which
occurred during a fight rehearsal on Wednesday night, during which Lily
ended up on the receiving end of the Neason napper, necessitating a
visit to hospital and three stitches.
Menu masters
STILL on the theme of footballers and restaurants, we are told that
Duncan Ferguson is going to start one called Porridge and that Mark
McNally of Celtic has plans to open The Fenian Haddie, while the
fearless John Brown of Rangers will be patron of Don't Duck A L'Orange.
Any suggestions you may have for other footballing eateries will be
hungrily received.
Idle hands
WHAT do you say to an arts graduate with a job? ''A burger with fries,
please.'' This somewhat cruel line and its even crueller situation of
highly trained young people being offered sweetie money for their
sweated labour is being firmly addressed by Sean Paterson of
Kelvinbridge.
As the founding member of the Glasgow Underemployed Graduates Society,
or GUGS, who meet every Monday at 7pm in the Bon Accord in North Street,
Sean decided that having the same number of letters in his qualification
as are in his name was enough and is currently trying to find employment
for his MSC in Structural Engineering Computational Technology.
Meanwhile, he whiles away the long hours sampling the range of fine
beers available in the Bon Accord and waiting for fellow wasted talents
like himself to come out of the woodwork. If you are similarly
afflicted, you are cordially invited to join him.
Sick bowl
THE Churchdown Parish Magazine of Gloustershire recently carried a
notice, no doubt prompted by some unwanted deposits, which said ''Would
the congregation please note that the bowl at the back of the church
labelled 'For The Sick' is for monetary donations only''.
Sibling rivalry
ONE of the questions in the latest issue of Trivial Pursuit concerns a
Mrs Day of Cheshire who, on the birth of her first son last year, saw
fit to name the poor wee tyke ''Zippitty Doo Dah''. The question is not,
as you may imagine, ''How old will he be before he finally cottons on
and changes it to 'Nigel' and commits matricide?'', but a simple true or
false. Rumours that his future siblings are to be called Breako and
Isn'titalovely are thought to be malicious lies spread by the gutter
press.
All together now
GLASGOW band The Usual Suspects (motto ''Indiepop, Alcohol, and
Profanity'') launch their first record on the Rubber Cabbage label,
entitled I Don't Know . . . I Just Like It, next Wednesday at the Halt
Bar in Woodlands Road, just across from the Lobey Dosser statue. The
fourth track on their debut is the romantic ballad Oh, Christ, My
Girlfriend's Drunk Again, which reminds us of those timeless pub
classics of yesteryear; Aw, Naw, Where's Ma Trousers and Are You Looking
At Me, Specky Four-Eyes.

Reader John Clunas wrote but two day ago to this blatt. ''The key must
lie in education rather than suppression,'' He objected to the
demonisation, of which he accused me, of young people as ''degenerate
scum''.
He has a point. Mind you the word ''degenerate'' means descending to
being without usefulness. I was writing last week about young people who
are exactly that, and without whom we could do. I was also writing with
a personal knowledge gleaned over many years of the degenerate scum I
was often forced to face.
Mr Clunas had more than a point, except he didn't come up with a
solution. Here I am giving out a few possibilities though. At least
attempts at solutions. But start with the problems.
But a week or so back a young male pupil in Saint Augustine's School
in Barrhead nearly caused a strike among his schoolteachers because he
had threatened to ''trash'' a young female teacher's car. Two months
before that one of his coevals had beaten up a young male teacher. On
neither occasion was any police action taken, nor was a report made to
the police.
The local authority were agog for declaring the teachers in that
school to be in breach of contract should they, as they threatened,
refuse to teach or have in their class either of the pupils.
I remember, it must have been about six years ago, a similar
circumstance in a school in Airdrie, indeed the school in which my own
brother is a principal teacher. This time it was a girl. She went to
court too and won her right to be accepted back as a pupil in the school
in which she had, and admitted it too, assaulted a young female teacher
by punching her in the face.
The teachers there were forced into accepting this girl back, by a
court and by the local education authorities. The girl hadn't put a
school uniform on herself since she was perhaps eight and it had all
been bought a few days before because she was going to look bloody great
in court, butter wouldn't melt in . . . Some teachers never learn. Her
victim did. She left the profession and quite right too.
Every teacher knows that awful sensation when they suddenly realise
that they are spending more time with the visigoths, pleading with them,
than they ever are with an ordinary, well-behaved, child who is being
ignored because he or she isn't doing anything other than needing to be
taught. Devil the bit, every social worker knows that, while they are
spending hours looking after delinquents, there are kids out there who
could do with help: it's just that they don't stab people or shoot up.
No adolescent finds it easy but all of them find it a bloody sight
harder when the budget and the priority -- all of it -- is for the
children of the underclass.
Holidays in bloody Africa for heaven's sake, for thieves and muggers
and trips away all summer for housebreakers aged 13: lunacy. But
ordinary young people? For the truly awful argument which is hardly ever
made is that the overwhelming majority of young people -- I place that
at anything below 25 -- are thoroughly decent, horribly responsible,
trying to please and, these days, a bit too anxious.
There is not much for teebagers to do these days. Where my generation
had church hops damn near every day of the week, and certainly lots of
fun at weekends, the teenage visigoths have seen to it that no minister
or priest or youth worker can afford to take the chance of opening up a
church hall of a weekend. When I was a teenager we used cafes the way
adults used pubs. When I was practically Ricky Nelson in ice-blue jeans
I had lots of things to do, lots of people to see, lots of ways of
becoming an adult.
A lot of things have undeniably changed and parents are as unsure of
what they can offer to their children as the children are unsure of
themselves. But few people seem to know what to do. Most young people
grow up up natural and not absurd these days, God knows how, but can
there not be ways of ensuring that? The disgracefully swollen sums of
money for a collection of effete bourgeois arts which the Lottery is
shelling out for, can surely be harnessed for real money, real efforts,
for our young people (and if it comes to that for our elderly as well).
I don't want to get mugged in the street by kids who have lapsed into
a vacuous sub-culture of dissidence while arty parasites are swanning
about metropolitan maypoles in evening dress. It is all very well
greeting about the scumbags. You should be greeting for the decent kids
on the block who you aren't thinking about at all.

SUCCCESS in rock'roll can be cruelly arbitrary. Consider the case of a
little-known late-sixties American band, Paul Dowell and the Dolphin.
Despite being a gifted vocalist, Paul Dowell is now a railway
train-conductor in Washington DC.
Meanwhile, Paul Dowell's former guitarist will be making a rare
Scottish appearance on Sunday night, at Glasgow's Plaza, counting
himself lucky to have survived 27 years as a professional musician.
''It's a glaring imbalance that being talented doesn't always translate
into making a living,'' says Nils Lofgren, recalling his start in the
business.
Since then Nils has become one of rock's most esteemed team-players. A
member of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band since 1984, Lofgren has also
famously assisted Neil Young, on After The Gold Rush, and Ringo Starr.
But he opts for modesty when he considers his solo career.
''Music has always been something I've had to do, but I've been very
fortunate. I know how easy it is to get crushed. Thousands of bands are
trying to attract the attention of radio stations who concentrate on
maybe 20 or 30 records a week. There have been disheartening,
demoralising times when I haven't been able to get a record deal. But
nothing has ever stopped me writing songs.''
Damaged Goods is Nils's latest batch, his eighth, released on the
Transatlantic label. It's a commendably organic and open-minded album
which reveals an enduring love of music in all its forms, both old and
new, particularly on the arresting gospel-hip-hop-country groove which
is Black Books.
''New forms are never actually that new,'' opines Nils. ''It's more
older influences being re-established in a way that's fresh. Adopting a
fresh attitude and throwing the rule book away.''
Just the ticket. All aboard for Sunday night's Lofgren excursion.

THE prestigious and highly rated jazz course at Berklee College of
Music in Boston will be available to musicians in Britain for one week
only in Glasgow next year.
Following the trail blazed by Edinburgh saxophonist Tommy Smith, young
musicians like pianist Steve Hamilton, drummer Paddy Flaherty, and now
saxophonist Laura Macdonald and trombonist Nicol Thompson, have all gone
from Scotland to study at Berklee.
The flow of young talent from a country previously unrepresented at
the college intrigued Dean of Studies Larry Bethune, who claims Scottish
roots, his family having left Kintyre in 1774.
Bethune said yesterday that he tried to remain dispassionate about his
personal connection with Scotland, and had been amazed at the level of
activity and talent he had found in the country, and the lack of
bragging about it that went on.
''What I found in in Glasgow was like the 1849 California goldrush,
but there seems to be a tendency in Scotland to play things down,'' he
noted.
Introduced by Hamilton to the passionate Bobby Wishart, director of
the Strathclyde Youth Jazz Orchestra, the plans for a school in Glasgow
began to form. The catalyst was the involvement of Strathclyde
University's head of applied music, Mark Sheridan, and the establishment
of the National Jazz Institute at the university's Jordanhill campus.
The #50,000 project has been co-ordinated by former Glasgow
International Jazz Festival director Iwan Williams. He described the
course as ''one of the most important developments in the teaching of
music in Scotland. Ten of the faculty at Berklee will teach an intensive
week course for 150 of the brightest young musicians in Britain.
''They'll be bringing the quality of teaching of jazz to Glasgow that
in the past you had to go to the States to get. It will enhance the
reputation of both Glasgow and Scotland.''
Williams said that 36 of the ''graduates'' of SYJO have gone on to
professional jazz careers and although the lowest possible commercial
rate of #350 has been set for the fees for the course, it was important
that there was provision for people with ability but not the means.
Indications of financial support for bursaries for students had
already been received from Glasgow City Council, Strathclyde Regional
Council, the Arts Council of England, and the Scottish Arts Council.
''We will do everything to make sure that nobody who should be here
can't get here,'' he said.
*
The Berklee in Glasgow course will run from April 6, 1996 with a
graduation concert on April 12.

YOU highlight the views of Mr David Mellor and his assertion that the
National Lottery Charities Board should have given cash to RNIB Scotland
for their ''really good work'' -- rather than Strathclyde Poverty
Alliance (October 24).
From my 12 years or so in the voluntary sector in Scotland I
understand that the Strathclyde Poverty Alliance is both an effective
and efficient organisation.
From my six years in the visual-impairment field I am well aware of
the quality of RNIB Scotland's work.
The question is: how does Mr Mellor know? Has he taken an in-depth
look at both organisations? Is he aware that by far the great majority
of services to visually impaired people in the UK and in Scotland are
provided by local societies for the blind?
Perhaps what we have an example of here is the ''brand-naming'' of
charities. As a feature of the competitive element introduced by this
Government in order to pull funds from voluntary organisations into
community care, charities are forced actively to promote and market
their own corporate images in order to influence purchase of services by
local authorities and donation of funds from the general public.
It may be remiss, even foolhardy, that local voluntary organisations
choose to put their funds into services to clients and not into
promotion and public relations, but I wonder what Mr Mellor might think
of such groups acquiring marketing staff in order to compete with the
publicity machines of the large organisations?
RNIB Scotland, despite holding an office in Edinburgh, has most of its
work and the majority of its funding controlled directly from London.
The National Lottery Charities Board, Scotland, deserves congratulation
for its advocacy on behalf of Scotland and for its determination to
support truly local bodies.
The Glasgow and West of Scotland Society for the Blind were allocated
funds in the recent round, but much less than we had applied for and as
a one-year starter rather than the three-year support we had hoped for.
Nevertheless, we were happy with the evaluation of our application and
see our award as a challenge to put our skills and ingenuity to the
test. We accept that readily.
Our work -- and that of other local charities -- deserves the
compliment of thought and consideration. None of us, whether local or
national bodies, benefits from the uninformed and unenlightened
utterings, characteristic of opinion-rental, from Mr Mellor and his ilk.

Chief Executive, Glasgow and West of Scotland Society for the Blind,

YOU have misreported me in saying that I find Scottish arts funding
''iniquitous'' (October 12). What I did say was that it was inequitable
that the first cash cut in the history of the Arts Council should have
fallen on England alone.
I have a great admiration for the work of the Scottish Arts Council
and am continually in touch with it. I am well aware that its core
funding is not what it should be, but it did not suffer the cut that we
did.
As to my political asides at a political meeting, I merely pointed out
that it was ironical, even funny, that Conservative Governments tended
to fall over backwards to try and be generous to Scotland, Wales, and
Northern Ireland at the expense of England.
As an Irishman with a Scots name, who lives in Wales, I happen to find
this trait personally congenial.

AS the battle lines begin to be drawn over the M74 extension into
Glasgow, and I read of an even bigger row brewing in Berkshire, I am
amazed by the capacity for heat to exceed light in these debates.
While it is clear that motor transport is noisy and smelly, even the
protesters benefit from its advantages, so rather than climb their trees
and camp in front of the bulldozers to stop what is needed and
inevitable, might they not better spend their time arguing for better
practice when roads are built?
By the same token the authorities could probably do more to reduce the
adverse impact of these developments by, for instance, ensuring that
proper noise screens are built alongside new motorways and fast through
routes to protect those living nearby and to contain the nasty fumes
within the roadway as far as possible, as happens in France now
(following noisy protests, it must be said).
Extensive tree planting can further conceal the offending traffic from
sensitive ecologists and proximate housing at the same time. The extra
cost is small compared with the cost of the ferocious battles which seem
to precede any much needed improvement in our roadway system.
However, I fear such pragmatism is less fun than a good fight, and now
that nuclear disarmament has lost its urgency protesters need another
target, so why not roads?

ONCE again within a few days I am compelled to write to The Herald on
a matter of fact, which need not have arisen if your editorial staff had
the courtesy to speak to me before putting pen to paper.
An otherwise excellent profile on my Monklands colleague, Helen
Liddell's, promotion was needlessly tarnished to Margaret Vaughan's
comment that this was seen as ''Tony Blair's two-fingered salute to the
antics of those who promoted Tom Clarke'' (October 25).
It is certainly not seen that way by Tom Clarke. On the contrary I see
Helen Liddell's promotion continuing the proud tradition of this area's
continuous representation on Labour's Front Bench for the past 21 years.
Far from offering a two-fingered salute, Tony Blair responded to my
re-election to the Shadow Cabinet in the most positive way. He confirmed
Labour's commitment to disabled people's rights by awarding that
portfolio Shadow Cabinet status for the first time.
Helen Liddell had my support for selection in Monklands East, because
I recognised that she had the qualities to succeed in what was bound to
be a difficult campaign, and I worked hard to secure her election.
Tony Blair and George Robertson had a difficult choice to make because
of the number of able Scottish Labour MPs; it would be entirely out of
character for me to give them anything less than 100% support.

E T MACKIE is deluding himself if he believes the M74 extension will
create jobs (October 23). There is no evidence to link new roads and new
jobs. Any research done on the matter suggests the opposite. Where are
all the new jobs we are promised every time a politician opens a new
road?
Is he seriously suggesting that #250m of taxpayers' money be spent
just to take 15 minutes off drivers' time? Do we need this more than a
well-educated, well-housed, and healthy workforce?
Instead of squandering this money on a damaging and expensive white
elephant we should be making maximum use of our existing rail network.
Mossend should not be treated as a rail terminal. Freight should be
forwarded to other parts of Scotland by rail rather than road.
The M74 extension will bring shame on Glasgow and on the Labour Party.
The Scottish Office, Strathclyde region, and Glasgow district cannot go
on for ever ignoring the experts ranged against this monstrosity.

LAST week saw the opening of the Skye Bridge, my wedding anniversary
and my birthday. What was memorable was the fuss over tolls on the
bridge.
Earlier in the month I travelled to Golspie for my youngest
brother-in-law's birthday. My wife and I went up the A9 and returned by
the A82. So we crossed the Balloch Bridge, the Kessock Bridge, the
Dornoch Bridge and on the return journey crossed the Ballachulish Bridge
and maybe many others.
At no time did we pay tolls. So why should people travelling to Skye
be forced to pay tolls?
About 30 years ago, the Erskine Bridge was opened and we were advised
that tolls would apply till we paid off the loan. In recent years the
tolls just managed to pay the wages of the staff collecting tolls and
maintenance costs and the loan is still not repaid.
The road to Skye is part of the national road network so why should it
not be free like other roads?
It is about time that this Government realised roads are roads whether
by bridge or tunnel and that the public pay enough in road tax and
petrol duty not to have to pay additional fees to meet the costs.

AT a meeting in Elderslie Village Hall on October 20, the Windyhall
Quarry Action Group was formally dissolved.
This was a very happy occasion. The group had been advised that on
August 9, the Secretary of State's decision was to dismiss the appeal by
Scottish Aggregates in relation to their unsuccessful planning
application to Renfrew District Council to form a quarry at Windyhall
Farm on the outskirts of Elderslie.
Following the Secretary of State's decision, Scottish Aggregates still
had open to them a right of appeal which had to be submitted within six
weeks.
No appeal was submitted. The action group, set up almost six years
ago, has been successful in its aim -- to prevent a quarry from being
inflicted on the residents in Elderslie, Johnstone, and Foxbar.
It has been a long, hard battle for the members of the action group
and those local residents who helped during the campaign. Some people
dared to say that we could not win a fight against big companies with
lots of money. Others said it was all politics and we could not beat the
politicians.
We took them all on and we won. People power proved in the end little
people are listened to!
I am delighted that the battle is won -- as I did not relish the
thought of Councillor Bobby Stevenson and Jim Lewis, both members of the
action group, along with other residents of Glenpatrick Road and many
other areas which would be affected, lying down in front of the first
lorry to make its way to ''Windyhall Quarry''. Thank you to all who
supported the group.

IT is a pity that Martin Blackshaw (October 24) feels uncomfortable
with the moves of the Roman Catholic Church to reach an understanding
with the Jewish people today free of the attitudes of the past whose
only result has been misunderstanding and persecution.
The Jewish community in Scotland is happy that it engages in dialogue
with various churches on a basis of mutual toleration and respect. It
acknowledged the progress made by the Catholic Church under the guidance
of Pope John in Vatican II in stating that ''what happened in his
Passion cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction,
then alive, nor against the Jews of today''.
The calumny of deicide, as repeated by your correspondent and equated
with Nazi genocide, is unworthy of anyone working for inter-faith
harmony, unworthy of anyone with religious sensitivity, and unworthy of
being accorded space in your newspaper.

CLARE Henry marred an otherwise useful review of Pamela Robertson's
book on Mackintosh (Art is the Flower, October 20) by ending it with an
absurd statement that she sometimes wonders if we would have heard of
Mackintosh at all without the late Professor Andrew McLaren Young.
The standard work on Mackintosh -- Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the
Modern Movement -- was published by Thomas Howarth in 1952, was in print
until 1966, and was reissued in 1979.
Full information on Mackintosh has been available to the public more
or less continuously since 1952, without any assistance from Prof
McLaren Young who had no record of interest in Mackintosh until the
large centenary exhibition of 1968, where he relied on Howarth for many
of his catalogue notes.
McLaren Young certainly did look after the Hunterian Mackintosh
Collection, but this was also first catalogued by Howarth, who was a
lecturer in Glasgow School of Architecture/School of Art.

THE Herald has the reputation of being a well-informed and responsible
newspaper. Jack McLean's article on private taxis does nothing to
enhance this reputation (October 23). It is ill-informed,
ill-researched, inaccurate, and out-of-date.
First there is no such thing as a private taxi. There are taxis and
private hire cars, of which the number currently holding Glasgow City
Council licences is approximately 1800.
True, the Millennium Plan proposals, designed to improve the city
centre in Glasgow, originally recommended that bus links and bus lanes
be exclusive to buses, taxis, and cycles only but after correspondence,
discussion, and a meeting between Strathclyde Roads, Strathclyde Police,
and our association the service provided by private hire cars was
appreciated and the recommendation concerning bus links and bus lanes
was amended to include private hire cars ''providing that suitable
additional livery can be agreed'' (to ensure that private hire cars can
be easily recognised as such).
As to the remarks that ''privates'' were sometimes insufficiently
insured and that some drivers were ''out-and-out villains'', this is
just not true. Private hire care drivers (and taxi drivers) have their
details submitted to and passed by the police before a licence will be
issued and owners of private hire cars have to prove continuous
appropriate insurance cover before a licence will be issued or
re-issued.
As to comparisons with London where there is no licencing of minicabs,
this is as irresponsible as mentioning assaults and rapes and drug
barons and intimidation.
Glasgow City Council, Strathclyde Police, and the private hire car
systems are co-operating to provide as safe a service as is possible.
We are pleased to have had the opportunity to discuss with Professor
Carruthers and his team and jointly resolve the potential problems to
our trade posed by the Millennium Plan.

Secretary, Greater Glasgow Private Hire Association,

COUNCILLOR Alistair Watson made a tremendous attack at Brighton on PR.
He denounced a referendum on PR because he said it offers a way forward
only for minorities such as the Liberals, Scottish Nationalists, and the
Fascists of the BNP.
Has he ever noticed who benefits from the present system? Certainly
the Labour Party gets to run a lot of local government. But in local
government it has to obey the orders of central government, and the
first-past-the-post system has allowed the Tories to win the last four
General Elections with a share of the vote which has never exceeded 44%
and which has steadily declined.
What does Councillor Watson really like about a system which
guarantees the Tories unchecked power in the House of Commons for 16
years in 20?
The real beneficiaries of proportional representation would be the
people who would get a council or a parliament which would accurately
reflect the balance of political opinion -- 42% of the vote would secure
42% of the seats.
No party could get an absolute majority of seats without an absolute
majority of votes. One-party tyranny would be impossible. That is why
wiser counsels in the Scottish Labour Party and the Scottish TUC have
accepted that the Scottish parliament must be elected by proportional
representation.
It is quite wrong to imagine that proportional representation would
inevitably lead to Lib-Lab coalitions. If the tendency to policy
convergence is any guide, the most likely coalition in England appears
to be the one jointly led by Mr Blair and some relatively fragrant Tory,
such as Mr Dorrell.

IT is ironic that the vexed issue of fishing policy has struck a blow
for the European Union, but one outcome of yesterday's agreement in
Luxembourg is the removal of fishing from the pantheon of European
devils. The problem which lay at the core of a good deal of heat, if not
much light, was the issue of admitting Spain and Portugal to traditional
British and Irish fishing grounds without infuriating indigenous
fishermen. It was also necessary to honour the Commission's sensible
rule that there should not be an overall increase in fishing effort in
the areas in question on the grounds of conservation. This seemed
initially to be an almost impossible task. Fishermen feared the arrival
of hundreds of unruly members of the Spanish fleet while anti-EU
campaigners stoked the flames of anxiety with every lurid innuendo on
which they could lay their hands. In the end the whole affair has been
settled by the traditional method of reasonable negotiators sitting down
together to talk out their problems and arrive at a compromise. This was
always a possibility, but if there is one lesson to be learned from this
episode it is the old one that more can be accomplished by quiet
discussion than by angry posturing and by threats to flounce off into
the night.
Is the agreement a good one? It is certainly a good deal better than
the weighty programme proposed by the European Commission which would
have been costly to implement and difficult to carry through with any
degree of efficiency. The Commission's proposals were defeated by
creative diplomacy on behalf of the Spanish who assembled the concerned
countries behind alternative proposals with the sensible support of the
British negotiators. There will not now be a fishing free-for-all, which
was an outcome feared by Scottish fishermen. Instead, the reasonable
number of foreign boats to be admitted to the 92,000 square mile area of
the Irish Box, which includes coastal waters around Ireland and the
Channel off the west coast of Britain, will be monitored carefully and
must announce their entry and exit to the area. Spanish boats will
remain excluded from the North Sea, the Bristol Channel, and the Irish
Sea. If there are penalties for British fishermen it seems likely that
they will affect English fishermen and the relief to be felt in Scottish
ports last night was palpable.
It is clear that the ridiculous position in which Spain and Portugal
were still not full members of the Common Fisheries Policy a full decade
after they had joined the European Union could not be allowed to
continue. It is equally obvious that, although the newly arranged
agreement is welcome and a great advance on anything which had been
envisaged previously, the problems of implementation will remain.
Specifically, the question of cheating on catches must continue to be
examined. This has been an enduring source of worry for both British
fishermen and the British Government. European Commission proposals to
deal with it were also under consideration at the recent negotiations
and these included a computerised monitoring of catches and surveillance
of fishing boats by satellite. These plans have been postponed because
of a reluctance to spend large sums of money on them. Fisheries
Ministers have decided instead to increase the EU budget for control
measures by a paltry #164m over five years. Britain will thankfully
maintain and expand its own national provisions but it should be obvious
to those involved that this agreement, acceptable as it is, will work
only if the participants can be assured of fair treatment. Existing
monitoring has not achieved this goal and it would be sad indeed if this
significant advance in European relations is marred through insufficient
policing.

WE all work much too hard for our own good, and the good of those who
employ us. These conclusions will evoke considerable surprise, and may
even be disputed -- they will certainly be debated. The evidence about
the time we work is, however, not in dispute: the statistical evidence
is that British males work longer hours than anywhere else in Europe.
German males who work the shortest hours in Europe none the less enjoy
the highest per capita incomes. It seems that no-one actually imposes
the long hours regime on British workers; rather it is sought after by
ourselves so that a culture of long hours has developed. What exists is
not in the main a financially driven phenomenon but an anthropological
one. Long hours worked may attract additional payments but the dynamic
is far more complex than can be explained simply by reference to
overtime rates. Instead factors like loyalty to the company, the
attractions of a hard-working image both for individuals and their
employers, fear of unemployment (especially prevalent at the moment),
and the inability of management to see the inherent disadvantages, all
combine to make long hours acceptable labour.
Austin Knight, the recruitment agency, published this week the results
of a survey designed to consider the consequences of this habit. They do
not make good reading. Overwork damages health and reduces productivity.
Employers know this: 90% of those employers surveyed said that long
hours reduced performance, adversely affected health, and lowered
morale. Workers themselves are aware that this is the case: nearly half
those interviewed felt that their own performance suffered from the
practice. Within the hierarchy of a workforce, there seems to be no
relief at the top (though there is far more money) for senior managers
turned out to be working the longest hours. In all cases and categories,
men turn out to be far worse affected than women, suggesting that some
macho elements may be involved in what Austin Knight regard as a
cultural phenomenon. It is a counter-productive culture in that it
increases costs (health costs, for example) and lowers output,
productivity, and profitability. That is a narrow way of measuring its
negative contribution to the national life, but a broader social measure
has no compensating positive aspects, instead the quality of family life
is seriously impaired and individual workers are exposed to exceptional
levels of stress.
The findings of this survey are not contradicted by others; and tend
to be reinforced by anecdotal evidence. Even historical evidence is
supportive of Austin Knight: when in the early 1970s the Heath
administration was forced, by politically motivated industrial action,
into the three-day week (to conserve scarce energy supplies), national
output and productivity were unimpaired. Too little has been made of
that memory. Instead we seek to augment the weight of all factors
encouraging over-long hours of work, from the sharp reduction in the
power of unions to protect their members to the refusal to contemplate
the EU's Social Chapter as an alternative mechanism for protecting
employees automatically. The advantages which long hours do provide in
cheap labour costs (low wages) are hailed as economic magnets which
attract inward foreign investment. There is almost no awareness of this
other price; indeed we affect not to identify it at all, a process in
which the Government is a conscious offender. A rational society, of
which we ought to be an example, cannot admit to failings without moving
to reform. Over-long working hours involve huge costs for no extra
benefits. The case for reform is overwhelming even if the first steps
are modest, like minimum wage legislation.

THERE are few more basic rights in a democratic society than for
working people to be represented by a free trade union or association,
in order to protect and promote their interests in negotiation with
employers.
If a majority want to be represented by a trade union, that should be
their absolute right. The opportunity should be freely available to test
whether or not that demand exists. If it does, it must be responded to.
As simple as that. Trade union freedom is just as important as, let's
say, artistic freedom.
When these concepts were promoted in Poland and the Soviet Union, they
were widely hailed by leaders of the Tory Party. Sadly, they have never
been so keen on them at home and this fundamental human right is one
which is now, temporarily, beyond the reach of millions of employees.
What an arrogant denial of these basic rights is involved when an
employer can commit the following words to paper: ''We do not recognise
national, regional or local bargaining arrangements. Accordingly, none
of our staff will be covered by collective bargaining.''
The astonishing point, however, is that these words were not written
by some hole-in-the-wall private entrepreneur but by a senior official
of an ostensibly respectable public body, which occupies one of the most
prominent locations in the centre of Glasgow.
To put it another way, they were written by Mrs A Isobel Fowler,
director of finance and administration at the Royal Scottish Academy of
Music and Drama. And they represent another stage in one of the most
obsessional resistances to trade union recognition that I have ever
encountered.
Today, a battle which has raged over the past five years will come to
a head when the governors of the RSAMD finally decide whether or not to
recognise Unison as the legitimate representatives of support staff
within the academy.
The auguries are not promising. On December 9 last year, Mrs A Isobel
Fowler wrote: ''I have to advise you that the Board of Governors has
considered your request for recognition and decided unanimously not to
recognise you. The board would not be prepared to specify any particular
percentage (of Unison membership among relevant employees) which would
trigger recognition.''
This approach makes the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama the
only institute of higher education in the whole of Britain which does
not recognise Unison. I wonder if anyone, other than Mrs A Isobel
Fowler, who appears to have been given virtual carte blanche to
determine this matter, can explain why that extraordinary status was
ever achieved and has since been defended so tenaciously?
When The Herald last highlighted the situation at the RSAMD, the
governors solemnly decided ''not to write to the Glasgow Herald (as) it
was considered that it would protract the bad publicity''. I hope they
might realise now that the ''bad publicity'' will be protracted for as
long as they maintain this bizarre stance.
The anomaly is all the more odd since the RSAMD's governors apparently
find no difficulty in recognising trade unions which represent academic
staff. Both Equity and EIS are supporting Unison in their demand for
recognition. So, too, is the National Union of Students. But Mrs A
Isobel Fowler remains resolute.
According to Allan Wilson, the Unison official dealing with the issue:
''The situation in the academy came to a head in the autumn of last year
when they withdrew from membership of the Conference of Scottish
Centrally Funded Colleges and refused me permission to represent a
member disciplined at work and wishing to appeal.
''Our members met and decided unanimously to campaign to restore full
trade union recognition, including bargaining rights.'' Mr Wilson (no
relation but a good friend) can catalogue a string of cases where
ex-employees were allegedly ''victims of the regime, sacked because
their face didn't fit or because they sought trade union rights.''
I have no doubt that Allan Wilson would be delighted to furnish the
details of these cases, if the governors decide to persist with their
attitude or wish to challenge his assertion.
It is surely past time for the people who lend their names to the
Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, and who probably have very
little knowledge of what has been going on, to demand answers -- or else
dissociate themselves entirely from such a virulently anti-union
organisation.
In spite of the ''unanimous'' claim for the governors' previous
decisions, there are certainly several within that category who are
appalled by the way in which the academy is being brought into
disrepute. They deserve the support and encouragement of the Honorary
Fellows who are paraded by the academy.
Most of these people are, I suspect, trade unionists and quite a few
are certainly in Equity. There are some well-known artistic figures who
would be extremely concerned about the idea of non-academic or
non-artistic staff being singled out for this kind of discriminatory and
capricious treatment.
Having studied the correspondence, I regard this as one of the most
inexplicable pieces of sheer prejudice I can recall. It is high time for
the people who have responsibility for the good name of the Royal
Scottish Academy of Music and Drama to dissociate themselves once and
for all from a distasteful vendetta.

MICHAEL TUMELTY speaks to composer Carl Davis about his surprise
liaison with Paul McCartney to celebrate a milestone.
CONDUCTOR Carl Davis didn't know what he was letting himself in for in
1989 when, without considering the implications, he answered a question
with the words ''Paul McCartney''.
Davis had been approached by the general manager of the Royal
Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra with a view to discussing the
orchestra's plans for its forthcoming 150th anniversary celebrations.
The American conductor was asked by the RLPO management if he had any
ideas for something unusual for the celebratory season. ''Without any
thought, I said: 'What about something with Paul McCartney','' recalled
Davis, in Scotland for two performances with the Royal SNO at the
weekend of the resultant Liverpool Oratorio, co-written by McCartney and
Davis.
The management, predictably, thought it was a brilliant idea, and gave
Davis the go-ahead to pursue a project. Now this was all very well,
thought Davis, but there was a basic problem. ''How do I find Paul
McCartney; how do I get to him?''
There was one possible line of contact. Carl Davis's wife, the actress
Jean Boht, was starring in the TV series Bread. Paul and Linda McCartney
had put in a guest appearance in one episode. ''That was the avenue,''
said Davis. ''Linda McCartney was a friend of the series writer Carla
Lane. So I talked to Carla, Carla talked to Linda, she thought it was a
great idea, and suddenly a phone number was produced.''
The first meeting between the film music guru and the former Beatle
was, recalled Davis, ''very tense''. On the one hand, McCartney was
obviously bemused at the prospect of associating with a classical music
project; and on the other, Davis felt a bit overawed in the presence of
''one of the immortals''.
Davis spent some time explaining that the project was completely
open-ended: it would involve the orchestra and a choir, but it could be
what they chose to make it. And it would take place in Liverpool
Cathedral. This was the catalyst. The cathedral was across the road from
the Liverpool Institute, McCartney's old school. And that set him
reminiscing about his childhood, his upbringing during the war.
As McCartney spoke, Davis started scribbling. ''That afternoon, under
his nose, and on the back of a postcard, I started jotting down ideas
from his reminiscences,'' said Davis.
''Eventually I handed him eight titles derived from what he'd been
talking about. He liked the idea and the structure.''
The big question then, said Davis, was how it would be written, who
would do what. ''I did the structure, and he wrote the text, which
traces the history of Shanty, a Liverpool lad, from his birth during the
war, his peculiar schooling, growing up, meeting a girl, getting
married, quarrelling, and ending with a paean to family life and a
prayer for peace.''
The melodic inspiration for the work is all McCartney's, said Davis.
''What he is fantastic at is conceiving melodies and words together.
He'll sing a phrase, and find the words; and it will all go as one
package.'' Davis found McCartney's ability to communicate his musical
ideas to a scribe uncanny.
''After a while, I realised that he and the Beatles had done this for
years with George Martin -- Paul would la-la-la it, describe it, sing a
bit, play a bit, and put over exactly what he wanted.''
Davis described his own role as ''the midwife'', trying to get as much
as possible from McCartney himself, even down to suggestions for
orchestration.
McCartney developed through the two-year period of the composition,
said Davis. ''As we rolled along and the thing grew, Paul became more
confident about putting his ideas forward. In fact he became almost
determined to drive it.''
In terms of general style, the music and text are in some ways naive,
though not unattractive and quite touching. There are a handful of
dyed-in-the-wool, long-limbed McCartney melodies..''
''The source for the melodic inspiration of the piece,'' said Davis,
''lies in Paul's ballads, his love songs, and his rather hymnal side --
that you hear in Let It Be and The Long and Winding Road -- which had a
melodic inspiration, a certain gravity, and a beautifully-shaped line.
''In the oratorio, the style ranges from these simple ballad shapes to
a hymn at the end of the first movement, with a touch of the more
aggressive McCartney.''
Some of it, certainly, is characteristic -- particularly the tunes
written for the hero Shanty, in which you can easily imagine McCartney's
high voice floating the melodic line.

Minty Donald visits a festival which reflects the homosexual
community's muliplicity.
EVEN among the clamour of visual arts festivals currently fighting for
exhibition space in Glasgow -- notably, the expansive Fotofeis and
Amnesty International's Freedom Festival -- anyone with half an eye open
during the next week will be hard-pressed to miss the presence of
Glasgay!'s Visual Arts Trail, featuring more than 40 artists displayed
in 23 venues across the city.
Undaunted by the fact that all the city's major galleries were fully
committed, Visual Arts Co-ordinator, Andy Lindsay, approached an
eclectic mix of (mostly) non-gallery spaces, opting for widespread
visibility rather than a single-focus showcase. Both he and the
ubiquitous Rory Donaldson, on this occasion wearing the hat of selection
panel member and contributing artist, admitted that they would like to
see next year's Glasgay! visual arts programme mount a high-profile
exhibition in a major gallery. However, they remain firmly committed to
the idea of artwork located throughout the city, reaching a public who
might not specifically seek it out.
''We'd like to do both,'' Lindsay explains. ''We hope to build a
reputation with this year's Visual Arts Trail which will allow us to
approach some of the big galleries next time round.''
The strategy of placing art in non-gallery spaces, through a
combination of necessity and intention, has thrown up some intriguing
juxtapositions. My particular favourite sees The Torso Show at designer
clotheswear shop Ichi Ni San. The shop's seriously trendy clientele will
be treated to a display of work on the human torso: Caroline Bennet's
powerful but delicate cane and raffia depiction of the female body,
based on studies of her friends, a sculptural piece by Christopher Mark
Lloyd-Fox, mixed-media work from Neil Barr, and Les Heaulmes Brillantes
by Mike Angel, part of a series of work by the group, Queer Art.
Cafe Delmonica plays host to an exhibition of photographs by Edinburgh
artist Shelagh Atkinson. Larger than life, and more intense than
tech-colour, her images feature plastic action-men dolls and raw mince.
A humorous, if faintly repugnant, commentary on manhood . . . ''heads
full of mince'', perhaps?
Appropriately enough, a selection of artists working in video and
photographic media are featured in a mixed exhibition at The Glasgow
Film and Video Workshop. There are installations by Anthony Burke, who
describes his Pink Period Video Installation as ''a gay visit to high
modernism'' and by London-based artist Karen Dracoulis. Paul Stone's
kitschly-witty poster-like pieces composed of ''found'' images and
objects (toy plastic elephants, greetings cards and floral wallpaper)
arranged in repetitive grid formation counterpoint Rachel Field's richy
luminous digital images of Soho sleaze and stone-carved angels.
Guardian cartoonist (Millennium Basin) Kate Charleston and Rory
Donaldson also have work on show. Those with the stamina and appetite
for art-round-the-clock can extend the Art Trail experience into the wee
hours with a visit to Bennets Nightclub, where they can view more of
Anthony Burke's video installation work, and, tomorrow Allen Frame's
tribute to the late doyen of the erotic male nude, The Bill Costa Slide
Show.
The Arts Trail organisers have also shrewdly managed to incorporate
works by gay and lesbian artists already featured in Fotofeis and the
Amnesty Freedom Festival. Spirit and Loss (Fotofeis) occupying two shop
units on Kings Court, is an exhibition revolving around the subject of
Aids and HIV, reviewed in a contemplative, rather than militant mood.
Four artists tackle the interlinked areas of grief and spirituality in
strikingly different ways: Robert Flack's psychedelic Love Mind, teeters
between seventies kitsch and jewelled mysticism, while Bill Jacobson
creates deeply moving images of haunting simplicity; bleached-out
portraits which softly evoke memories of past lives.
A mere taster of what's on offer in Glasgay!'s Art Trail, perhaps, but
more than enough to whet the appetite. As Donaldson said, his ubiquity
seems to earn him the right to the last word, the work was selected not
on the strength of its overt concern with gay or lesbian issues
(although, naturally, much of the work on display deals with such) but
on its merit, the principle of a ''quality threshold'' being strictly
observed.
What results is a collection of work reflecting the gay and lesbian
community in all its diversity; from emergent talents to established
artists, working in media from oil paint and canvas to
computer-generated video, from Bennets, the city's longest running gay
and lesbian night club, to the solid Victorian edifice of Kelvingrove
Art Gallery and Museum. Pick up a map and follow the trail.

As authorities debate whether vegetable fat can be used to make
chocolate, Anvar Khan investigates the sweet's age-old and universal
attraction.
THE Swiss parliament, a non-EU member, voted this summer to allow
Swiss-made chocolate to contain vegetable fat. It was a momentous,
pro-manufacturing decision. Cocoa butter itself is an expensive
substance, but the addition of a cocoa butter substitute is not intended
to make chocolate cheaper, but to provide it with a longer shelf-life
for global distribution.
The move now has Brussels' chocolate barons and European burearocrats
debating the pros and cons of chocolate ingredients. It is thought that
in the shadow of the Swiss decision, pending legislation, manufacturers
will use less cocoa and more vegetable fat. At the moment, British,
Irish and Danish chocolate already contains vegetable fats other than
cocoa butter, and less cocoa solids than chocolate produced in France,
Germany, Belgium or Switzerland.
Good quality chocolate made from cocoa butter rather than vegetable
fat contains little cholesterol. The fats in cocoa butter are similar in
composition to olive oil. Purer chocolate contains beneficial nutrients
including magnesium, potassium and vitamin A, but only in products with
at least 40% cocoa solids.
The EU chocolate directive and another EU law, the labelling
directive, will come into force early next year. It will then become
compulsory for manufacturers to list the percentage of ingredients on
packaging, making it clear as to what amount of vegetable fat each
variety contains. You'd think manufacturers would be apprehensive, that
if the amount of sugar, and cocoa butter substitutes in a bar is shown,
consumers would be put off. But no.
British shoppers are not quality but price-orientated. They love junk
chocolate.
It is the sugar, not any other magical property, which gives the
consumer a buzz or high. Sweet-toothed Scots eat a higher percentage of
milk chocolate per head than the English, but good-quality plain
chocolate is as close to the taste of real chocolate as you'll get.
Alan Porter, managing director of The Chocolate Society, said a
consumer would find a staggering difference in taste between Cadbury
Bournville and Valrhona Grand Cru. A 50g bar of Bournville at 33 pence
is allegedly the Rab C. of the chocolate world; a 90g tin of Valrhona
Carre de Guanaja, Grand Cru de chocolat noir amer costs #5.30.
Reactions to a square of Bournville were joyful. It was compared to a
pint of Guinness, strong, dark and slightly bitter. Men and women
competed as to how long they could keep it on their tongue without
biting. Reactions to Grand Cru were delayed, involving comments such as
''plastic'', ''slow to dissolve'' and ''for posh people'', ''thin'',
''unsatisfying'' and ''liquoricy''.
The chocolate snobs were outvoted. Personally, I found Grand Cru
light. It doesn't make you feel as if you've pigged out, and it smells
of vanilla whereas Bournville smells of fat.
Real, pure chocolate is bitter and old, the milk and sugar version a
modern invention. The Aztecs and Mayans used cocoa as a vital part of
the many ceremonies whch punctuated their lives. Cocoa planters had
their own God, Ekchuah, to whom a dog bearing a cocoa-coloured spot was
ritually slaughtered. Cocoa was given to brave Aztec warriors as a
reward in the form of a drink called xocolatl.
Cocoa-bean drinking chocolate has always been the preserve of the
macho or the intellectual. In the eighteenth century, chocolate cafes
developed into men's clubs.
As for sex, well, after a heated discussion with The Chocolate
Society's MD, it was concluded that the connection between chocolate and
any aphrodisiac power is in the eating. The melting effect is
responsible for the sensual ''mmm'' factor.
Statistically, the reason for women being more rampant consumers of
chocolate is not romance or the lack of it, but PMT. Pure chocolate
contains a stimulant called theobromine which provides a natural high
and phenylethylamine, a euphoric which reacts particularly well with
female sex hormones. The Chocolate Society swear by chocolate at that
time of the month for ''evening the temperament''.
Apparently, good quality chocolate has always possessed a medicinal
ability. According to H H Bancroft in his book Native Races of the
Pacific States, the Aztecs ''dug up the bones of giants at the foot of
the mountains . . . ground them into a powder, mixed with cocoa, and
drunk it as a cure for diarrhoea and dysentery''.

PLAIN FACTS
* Sherlock Holmes drank chocolate for breakfast.
* Maria Theresa, wife of Louis XIV, presented her husband with some
chocolate in a casket as an engagement gift.
* The French author Voltaire, frequently drank chocolate with his
friend Frederick the Great of Prussia.
* Colonel Montague James, the first Englishman born in Jamaica, took
nothing but cocoa or chocolate for the last 30 years of his life. He
lived to be 104.
* Pope Pius V allowed chocolate to be drunk during the Lenten fast
because he found it so disgusting that he could not believe that anyone
would drink it voluntarily.
* Samuel Pepys refers in his diary to the time when he woke with an
almighty hangover after the coronation of Charles II and ''so rose, and
went with Mr Creed to drink our morning draft, which he did give me in
chocolate to settle my stomach''.
* Montezuma, ruler of the fabulously wealthy Aztec kingdom, was served
chocolate in golden cups before visiting his many wives.
* In 1604, Joseph Acosta wrote that chocolate was good for the stomach
and for catarrh.
* Sir Hans Sloane (1660-1753) physician to Queen Anne and George II
and also the diarist Samuel Pepys, first recognised the therapeutic
qualities while travelling in Jamaica. He saw malnourished, sickly
babies revived after taking a mixture of milk and cocoa. He is generally
credited as the first white man to mix the two together.
* Sweet-toothed Britons spend an average of #3000m per year on
chocolate and chocolate products, which is equivalent to every man,
woman and child munching through an annual total of 120 chocolate blocks
and bars, 10 bags of chocolates, 3lb of boxed chocolates, 1.5 Easter
eggs, 3.5 cream eggs, 17.5 mini-eggs and half a selection box.
* The Swiss consume 22lb (10kg) per head per year; Belgium is second
with 17lb (7.8kg), then Britain with 16.5lb (7.5kg), the US are bottom
with 4kg

STEPHEN McGINTY explores whether the monopoly of city centre fast-food
giants are killing off the traditional fish-supper.
IT is not the last supper. But the decision by Angelo Varese to open
his latest Blue Lagoon cafe in Dumbarton is a sure sign that the chips
are down for city centre ''fish bars''. Surveys still show fish and
chips as Britain's best-sell-ing fast-food takeaway, yet increasing
competition from global chains is taking a tough toll. In a
battle-ground of hamburgers, pizzas and pasta, the common fish-supper is
being battered.
For more than 25 years, the Varese's have plunged chips into the fat
pools of the Blue Lagoon chain chip shops in Glasgow. Despite having
recently sold their Renfield street site, the family still retain four
shops throughout the city centre, though one looks to be under siege.
The Argyle Street site is surrounded on all sides by Pizza Hut, Dunkin
Donuts, McDonald's, and Kentucky Fried Chicken. Expansion to fresher
fields outside the city is the order of the day.
The decision to open in Dumbarton frees the family from the fierce
pressure and competition of the city centre. Their new location on the
main street avoids the steep rents of Glasgow, and has allowed them to
cut prices, and offer fish-suppers for #1.50, around 25% cheaper than in
the city centre. The new store also offers a delivery service,
carry-out, snack bar and licensed restaurant.
''You do what you can to pull customers in,'' said Angelo Vareses,
sitting in his new shop. Varese took over running the chain from his
father, Ersilio more than 10 years ago, though he remains a guiding
hand. ''Fish suppers are still popular, but because there is now such a
wide choice they will never be as popular as they once were. Those days
are now gone.''
Today there are 754 fish and chip shops in Scotland. Individuals own
the majority while a few own small chains. John McMonagle, owner of
McMonagle's fish restaurant on Clydebank's stretch of the Forth and
Clyde canal, believes chip shop owners should pull together to compete
witht eh multi-national fast food companies with huge marketing budgets
to buy up television time.
McMonagle tried to organise a united deal between 20 chips shops
stretching from Aberdeen to the Borders with advertising in The Daily
Record. However, a common special offer could not be decided on and the
idea fell through. ''We need to come into the nineties. We need to
market ourselves. People still love fish suppers,'' McMonagle said.
''But we are up against firms like McDonald's which attract kids who
drag along their parents. It's hard to do. But it's what's needed. We
could never afford a television advert, but I think most chip shop
owners would agree to a levy on potatoes if the money was spend on
advertising. We've got telly ads for burgers what about the noble fish
supper?''
The Sea Fish Industry do charge a levy on fish, which is used to
organise promotions including the Fish And Chip Shop Of The Year Award
-- currently held by the West End Cafe in Rothesay. However, no
television adverts are as yet planned.
A sharp price cut has revamped McMonagle's business. Since he cut the
price of fish suppers to #1.50 business has boomed. Mid-week sales have
doubled even trebbled. Pointing to giant stacks of plastic containers he
said: ''Every one represents a fish-supper. I maybe selling 3000 a week,
but still what is McDonalds doing? Fish and chips may still be the
best-selling fast food across Britain, but not here!''
Paul Oldfield of the Potato Marketing Board said: ''Obviously we are
very keen to increase sales of fish and chips. It's a big market. Chip
shops use 4-500,000 tonnes every years which is a 12th of our crop. That
market makes up #650m each year. They used 46,000 tonnes of fish in
1993. It still remains a big, big market.''
The noble fish-supper has a lot on its plate. For 51 weeks out of the
year it is a foe, pumping cholestoral into communities whose hearts are
already clogged. Yet during national chip week in February it is a
friendly tradition which cannot be lost.
Whatever happens it will survive. What remains to be seen is just how
many of its dispensers will.

Margaret Vaughan examines how pressure in the new world of work is
causing employees to crack under the strain and is proving
counter-productive for companies who had been expecting more for less.
FRANK was feeling very strange when he got to the office that Friday.
He'd just sat down at his desk when someone came over and said how awful
he looked. He thinks it was the sympathy in the voice that tipped him
over: ''I burst into tears and sat there shaking, saying over and over
'I can't cope, I can't cope, I just can't cope'.''
Crises like that don't happen to people like Frank. Careers in
computers are made for high-fliers like him: honours graduate, 12 years
with an internationally successful company, recent promotion, a salary
and perks worth more than #60,000 a year.
On that October morning last year the black cloud floating over him
finally burst. The immediate cause was probably bullying tactics used by
his new boss. He felt undermined, intimidated, threatened and powerless
to do anything about it. But he's sure that the underlying cause was
fatigue.
''After 18 months of enormous stress, putting in 12, 14 hours a day,
taking work home, feeling afraid all the time, my brain packed in under
the strain.'' He won't go back. Still on extended sick leave, he expects
a severance package to be offered within weeks.
For Frank, the Kafkaesque element was that while he was driven to work
harder by his own fears, he was making more mistakes. The harder he
tried, the more his boss found flaws in his work. He couldn't win.
The destructive side of the leaner, meaner new world of work and the
age of corporate intimidation is now beginning to dawn.
Yesterday the findings of a somewhat ironically titled report The
Family Friendly Workplace gave lie to the idea that the
lunch-is-for-wimps ethos leads to improved efficiency. It doesn't.
The underlying message of the survey by the recruitment organisation
Austin Knight is that the long-hours culture is counter-productive. We
are working more and more to less and less effect.
It showed that a quarter of white-collar workers put in more than 50
hours a week in the office. Two thirds work 40 hours or more. Long hours
are becoming the norm. More than half of all white-collar workers felt
the long-hours culture was a firm feature of their workplace while many
felt under pressure from bosses to work longer hours than contracted.
Half of all men said their work performance suffered as their hours
grew longer. More than 75% said continually working long hours affected
them physically.
Yet instead of bringing better productivity, the long-hours culture
costs industry millions as employees take sick leave. More than half of
all white-collar workers said their personal life was damaged as a
result of the long hours. Their family life was under threat from
increased stress at work.
The findings were no surprise to Professor Shirley Fisher, a
specialist in the effects of occupational stress. She has observed that
the longer people work, the less efficient they become: ''People get so
tired they get blocks in their attention and they can't, by dint of
effort, overcome this. They appear to be working hard but their
efficiency level drops.
''Then there is the fatigue that comes when the density of what's
coming at you is so high you can't think straight.''
The Strathclyde University professor's recent book called The Mental
Assembly Line describes how lots of professionals now have to cope with
a constant stream of work which never lets up. The unrelenting pressure
of the information coming at them leads to a special kind of overload.
This, she argues, has come about as companies have cut out
middle-ranking management. It leaves executives and lower ranks
struggling to cope; two streams doing the work of three.
Then you have to ask why they put up with it. Easy, that one.
Insecurity, the fear of redundancy, the growth of short-term contracts,
the loss of influence of unions. With millions on the dole and another
couple of million looking for work, the cards are stacked in an
employer's favour. The 9-to-5 job for life has disappeared. Flexibility
is the buzzword.
But the new flexible friendly workforce culture has brought with it a
brutalisation of behaviour in many different organisations. The inner
life of firms of every type, of colleges and universities, of public
corporations and of private companies has coarsened and become
increasingly intimidatory.
A leading specialist in organisational structure, Professor Amin
Rajan, told a conference this week that many big British companies have
created a climate of fear for employees. He described demotivated
workforces, a climate where effort was more important than performance.
Employability meant security and high rewards for senior managers and
dispensability for the rest.
Those in power in such organisations have learned to speak a new
market language. Much of it is code for the crude statement: I can have
you sacked. The essence of the new code is a way of making people
frightened. There are the downsizers and there are the downsized.
The climate of insecurity that conditions life in the workplace has
been widely discussed. But what's been less noted is how this has
changed people's feelings for their work.
In her book Declining Fortunes, Professor Katherine Newman charts the
shift in American attitudes from a time when work was seen as the locus
of self-development to a time when a job is no longer a means of
expression or a way of contributing to the social good. Rather, the
purpose of work now is the pursuit of a degree of freedom; freedom to
consume, freedom to earn enough to get out.
The moral dimension of work is endangered by managers who don't grasp
that their staff may have purposes beyond preserving their jobs and
salaries.
Professor Fisher terms it war at work: ''People are putting the screws
on other people, to get things done quickly with less financial burden.
They want more ouput for less cost. It doesn't work.
''What happens is people go off sick and they don't come back to work
quickly because they want some time off to relieve the pressure.
''It is far better to have a system where you are not piling on the
agony. If you have people doing intensive work they should have some
personal jurisdiction to do it in their own time.''
Evidence from a study of the Civil Service has shown that it isn't the
top executives who collapse from heart attacks. Those who suffered
ill-health were the middle ranks and the juniors.
Those most at risk were in the lower grades, people whose lives
involved being bossed about, who didn't have much personal control. And
that, says Professor Fisher, is the key.
''When you are being forced to work faster than you can, you are
losing control, you are back on a mental assembly line.''
Bluntly, she says, what's happening to people now in workplaces is
terrible: ''This is not a political thing for me. It's not simply the
social costs. It's terrible, too, in terms of our ability to produce
good quality work. It is a drawback.''
Fine and dandy. But what can be done about it? Many of the changes are
here to stay. With five million people having lost their jobs since
1990, with employers emboldened by an avalanche of legislation that has
tied unions in knots, the revolt of the wage slave seems a mite unlikely
surely?
But there are organisational changes that can help, she says: ''One
can look at all the different tasks people are asked to do and the way
in which control is available to them.
''There are, too, some people who accept that they can work under
intense pressure for a short time, invest their money and get out.''
So while the long hours culture drives one section of the population
to work more, and achieve less, another section can't find any work with
which to fill their own long hours. What a funny world!

ANGER ABROAD
RESEARCHERS from the three studies which prompted the Committee on the
Safety of Medicines to issue widespread warnings about specific Pills
have been outraged by the Government's reaction.
Family planning experts have criticised the CSM's decision to ignore
the protective effects of the newer Pills on the cardio-vascular system
by focusing solely on the risk of thrombosis.
Epidemiologist Professor Walter Spitzer flew to Britain from Canada
specifically to express his anger at the way the Government has grossly
misinterpreted his research: ''I have never been as outraged as I am
now,'' he said.
Boston researcher Dr Hershel Jick was appalled to find his study
mentioned by the CSM after he submitted it in ''strict confidence''.
As for Dr Olav Meirik, co-ordinator of the World Health Organisation
he told GP magazine this week that the information had been badly
handled because WHO had not even completed its analysis of the study
data.
Now a statement by a whole group of GPs and family-planning services
has been issued condemning the CSM's action.
They emphasise that the third-generation Pills may give better
protection against heart disease, which is more serious than venous
thrombosis.

* The medical magazine GP was quick to respond with a brisk leader:
One and a half million women were alerted this week in one of the
country's biggest contraceptive Pill scares. The Committee on the Safety
of Medicines issued thrombosis warnings on seven brands of Pill.
Despite repeated pleas from GPs after previous media sensations,
including the withdrawal of two brands of MMR vaccine, the news was
broadcast before GPs had been informed.
The Government set up a cascade system to enable fast communication
with GPs. But this is meaningless if doctors are not told before
patients. A speedy reaction from the CSM is commendable if women's lives
are at risk, but it is irresponsible without warning GPs first.

Robert Powell talks to the young chief executive of the Clydesdale who
will challenge the banking world's old-fogey practices
FRED GOODWIN, who takes over Clydesdale Bank next March, is one of a
new generation of mould breakers at the top of the UK banking industry.
He switched into banking after a brilliant career in accountancy. And at
37, he must seem indecently young to many of the old fogeys in other
bank boardrooms.
He is even younger than Martin Taylor, a former financial journalist
who became head of Barclays Bank at the age of 41 in December 1994.
Banking to Goodwin is not a special art, it is just another business.
''I view myself more as a manager than as a banker,'' he said.
''Banking is like most other industries where a much broader range of
skills is needed than has historically been the case.''
A native of Paisley, Goodwin joined Clydesdale as deputy chief
executive in March after being headhunted from accountants Touche Roche.
The Glasgow-based bank announced yesterday that he will become chief
executive in March, when his boss, Frank Cicutto, goes back to Melbourne
to take a top job with Clydesdale's parent, National Australia Bank.
Goodwin is soft-spoken and bespectacled with a wry sense of humour and
forms part of a new team of young Turks brought in by Cicutto during his
two-year stint at Clydesdale.
Now Goodwin plans to follow through this shake-up in senior management
by turning Clydesdale into a more flexible bank driven by consumer
demand.
''Banks have been very slow to change, but at Clydesdale we have got
the bit between our teeth and we are going to change,'' Goodwin said.
''We are behaving more like retailers than bankers. I think that if we
start from the position that we are a bank and try to change all our
existing products we simply won't get there.''
But he admits there is a long way to go.
''Levels of customer satisfaction with banks are below the levels of
customer satisfaction you see in other service industries,'' Goodwin
said.
He believes that one well-trained counter clerk should be able to talk
knowledgeably about an overdraft, a mortgage, a business loan and life
assurance, without having to pass clients from one specialist to
another.
And bankers should get out of their offices more to meet customers on
their own ground.
''You will see perhaps greater emphasis on us bringing our bankers to
our customers rather than having our customers come into the branch in
the more traditional form,'' he said.
Goodwin thinks there is still too much capacity in UK banking, despite
the recent merger between Lloyds and TSB, and further consolidation is
inevitable.
And if friendly mergers can't be arranged, then hostile takeovers will
have to be rammed through.
''There comes a point in time when the number of non-hostile takeover
opportunities, the number of situations where you get a perfect
marriage, become fewer and fewer. You start to see people taking
strategic opportunties and being prepared to pay a higher cost,'' he
said.
Conventional wisdom says hostile takeovers in the banking industry
don't work, so Goodwin's message will not be well received by
Clydesdale's main competitors, Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of
Scotland.
Both banks have recently been the target of takeover speculation.
Goodwin has only been a banker for seven months, unlike Cicutto, his
outgoing boss, who has spent 27 years in the industry. But he has been
closely involved with Clydesdale ever since National Australia Bank
bought it from Midland in 1987.
He took part in the Touche Ross team that combed through Clydesdale's
books looking for hidden skeletons at the time of the purchase and
subsequently became the partner in charge of Clydesdale audits.
National Australia Bank, which also owns Yorkshire Bank in England and
Northern Bank in Northern Ireland, frequently asked him to run his eye
over potential acquisitions.
''I guess I got to know the bank and National Australia Bank pretty
well at that time. I got to know a lot of the people and I liked what I
saw,'' Goodwin said.
But he never consciously planned a move into banking and at Touche
Ross he also built up expertise in industry. Between 1985 and 1987 he
spent two years as a consultant to Rosyth dockyards, helping implement a
changeover to contractor management ahead of privatisation.
And in 1990 he did a six-month stint as a government-appointed
director of Short Brothers, the Belfast shipbuilder and planemaker, to
help prepare it for privatisation.
In his spare time Goodwin likes to tinker with old cars. He goes to
work in a flashy Jaguar, but has an old Triumph Stag at home which he
plays with at weekends. ''It's actually working at the moment, which is
a fairly rare condition,'' he said.
But right now his main domestic concern is a baby son born three weeks
ago.

Anvar Khan looks unsympathetically on the plight of the divorcee who
is obliged to cut down on life's little luxuries after an 'inadequate'
settlement.
MICK Flick, a man who sounds like a Catholic hairstyle, is the
51-year-old German heir to the Mercedes-Benz fortune currently being
pursued by an anxious ex-wife who says she cannot live on his divorce
settlement of #9m.
Friedrich Flick, is alleged to be worth #200m, so Maya Flick, aged 37,
wants more of his money. A quondam civil servant, she says she was
''catapulted'' into the lifestyle of the super-rich, and had to learn
how to spend fast. Hiring a private jet from Munich to London, she
protests, costs #10,000. I suppose a supersave return was out the
question.
Wives of rich men always know the price of everything. They're the
ones who check the receipt in restaurants. Totting-up is a perverse
pleasure when money is such a turn-on. You marry a millionaire not by
coincidence but design. The tabloids say that #9m is less than a lottery
win -- well, that's really putting it in perspective.
The Flicks divorced two years ago after eight years of marriage. Mr
Justice Thorpe, the Family Division Judge who ordered the settlement,
said the court should take into account the fact that a rich person
might spend #40 on a candle. Mr Thorpe should be caned. The idea of
sympathy for someone soft enough to spend a quarter of a woman's average
weekly wage on a knick-knack is offensive, and to pity someone who goes
to court to complain about how expensive it all is when these luxuries
add up, is sick.
I understand that Britain is an economy constipated by credit, but the
prerequisite of adulthood is managing money. Some women, like Maya, opt
out, and become dependants through marriage.
''The children are used to lifestyles. I am used to a lifestyle. (#9m)
seems a lot of money to anyone on a salary until you think how much
interest my ex-husband generates and how much interest I can generate.''
She's got it all worked out. Head like a calculator. She complains her
husband will always have more money than her. Tough. It's his.
Maya doesn't want to climb down the social ladder. She claims an
annual bill of #5000 for ''stocking a drinks tray for casual visitors''.
Maya Flick is indeed protecting her precious lifestyle, which is
nothing less than the means to show off. Rich women live to socialise.
Theirs is a culture where there is always someone new and important to
meet. A woman who spends #50,000 a year of her husband's money on
clothes, and who resides in a #2m pad in Surrey, does not want a return
to social anonymity.
Friedrich inherited his wealth, so it probably means less to him. Maya
adopted it, so to her it means more. He knows money is 99.9% of his
appeal. But women such as Maya never fully understand their very real
vulnerability. If you can't, for example, trust a man to take the pill,
how can you trust him with your financial future?
Maya is not free either, of the boring recriminations aired when an
ex-wife from the ''I helped choose the curtains'' school of invoicing,
thinks she's been done. Maya complains that she can't introduce her kids
-- two boys and a girl aged between five and eight (they have joint
custody) -- to a poorer way of life, implying that this would be akin to
mental and emotional cruelty.
''I have to keep the horses, pay for the children to fly to their
father and back to me. And this is why I have fought for two and a half
years -- to have some kind of justice,'' she bleats, in a lather of
curls and diamonds. She must believe that her ''international children''
will think less of her if she owns relatively little, in the way that
some rich people do.

With opinion polls showing growing support for a breakaway Quebec,
David North reports from Toronto that Canadians are trying to come to
terms with the dramatic turnaround in the fortunes of the separatists
DAYS before the Quebec referendum, the incredulous inhabitants of
what's known as ROC, the Rest of Canada, are beginning to think the
unthinkable: that their compatriots may, after all, opt to shatter the
vision of the founding fathers of confederation and go out into the
world alone.
The opinion polls that gave the federalist No side a decisive
advantage throughout much of the proceedings have swung the opposite
way. Most now indicate a dead heat or give the separatists a marginal
advantage. As the referendum campaign enters its final lap, the Yes side
is claiming to be within touching distance of victory on Monday and
there is open dissension in the No camp.
Federalist standard-bearer Daniel Johnson, leader of Quebec's Liberal
Opposition, broke ranks late last week by suggesting that Ottawa should
attempt to sway Yes voters by promising to reopen the constitutional
question after the referendum. But Prime Minister Jean Chretien, in New
York for the 50th anniversary session of the United Nations, brusquely
dismissed the idea. ''We're not talking about the constitution. We're
talking about the separation of Quebec from Canada,'' he said.
The two leaders immediately went into damage-control mode, issuing a
joint statement saying that they would support a constitutional
amendment recognising Quebec as a distinct society at some point in the
future. But exultant separatists were quick to exploit the split. ''Jean
Chretien will help us to vote Yes,'' the charismatic Lucien Bouchard,
leader of the separatist Bloc Quebecois, told a cheering rally in Quebec
City.
The Yes side has achieved a turnaround few would have predicted. Only
two weeks ago the separatists were languishing 10 points behind
apparently in danger of expiring from self-inflicted wounds.
A succession of federal bigwigs have been ramming home the message
that, contrary to separatist propaganda, there would be no economic or
political deals with an independent Quebec. Separation is separation,
federal finance minister Paul Martin, himself a Quebecker, told
businessmen in Montreal. ''All those benefits from being Canadian, we
don't offer them to Costa Ricans or Australians. Nor would they be
available to the citizens of a foreign country called Quebec.''
But the most glaring lapse on the separatist side was the failure of
its leader, Quebec premier Jacques Parizeau, to exploit his supporters'
initial enthusiasm, let alone that of the voters. Parizeau proved no
match for a surprisingly agile Johnson in skirmishes in the provincial
legislature.
Things got so bad that Mario Dumont, leader of the Parti de l'Action
Democratique and the third of the principals in the common front behind
the Yes campaign, mused that a loser mentality had gripped some sections
of the movement.
After a series of conclaves with close associates in suits, Parizeau
emerged to announce that he had appointed Bouchard as chief negotiator
with Ottawa in the event of a separatist victory. It was a face-saving
formula that fooled nobody. Parizeau was widely believed to have been
the victim of a coup and nobody has paid much attention to him since.
Coup or not, it was a fateful step. Once in every generation, it
seems, Quebec politics throws up a nationalist figure capable of
commanding the instant loyalty of the separatist movement. In the 1980
referendum campaign it was the legendary Rene Levesque. This time it is
Bouchard who has stolen the limelight and who, unlike Levesque whom he
idolised, may yet succeed in stealing the verdict.
Bouchard has shown little sign that his bout with necrotising
fasciitis, the flesh-eating disease which cost him his left leg and
almost cost him his life less than a year ago, has slowed either his
political savvy or his native wit.
He has advocated a cautious approach to sovereignty, emphasising his
willingness to talk about an economic and political partnership with
Canada. That accords well with the voters' cautious mood, while his
emotional appeal to their pride in being Quebeckers resonates with their
deepest instincts.
''A Yes vote has something magical about it,'' Bouchard told cheering
supporters recently.
Unless they have a hidden persuader up their sleeve, the federalists'
main hope seems to be that the polls will prove as wildly inaccurate in
1995 as they did 15 years ago, when the No camp won by 19 percentage
points. There is some reason to believe they will. The No voters are
notoriously reluctant to own up in public. But the federal camp would
feel a lot more secure if there was evidence that their message was
reaching its intended audience.

LABOUR yesterday spurned a call by Tory Party chairman Brian Mawhinney
to withdraw their parliamentary candidate for Exeter, a man who has
admitted planting bombs in South Africa.
John Lloyd, 54, a barrister, has said that as a member of the African
Resistance Movement in the 1960s he had planted bombs ''but only on
symbolic targets like radio masts and electricity pylons''.
He added: ''I was a very small fish. I was the bloke who drove the
car, basically.''
In the Commons, Mr David Lidington (Tory -- Aylesbury) described him
as a ''self-confessed terrorist''.
In response, the Prime Minister told MPs: ''I am totally opposed to
any act of terrorism and I have no doubt the majority of the people in
Exeter will feel the same way.''
Mr Lloyd, a former South African citizen is now a British subject. He
has been a councillor in Exeter since 1981 and, he claims, has made no
secret about his past.
Dr Mawhinney yesterday wrote to Labour leader Tony Blair reminding him
that Labour's national executive had investigated his past and told him
that he had nothing to worry about.
Dr Mawhinney: ''Even by the standards of the Labour Party, this is
extraordinary. I therefore call on you to make it clear immediately that
this man will be dropped as your candidate.
''Failure on your part to do so will only confirm the impression given
each year by Labour's failure to support the renewal of the Prevention
of Terrorism Act that you remain soft on terrorism.''
But a Labour Party spokesman said they would not even bother to reply
to Dr Mawhinney. He said: ''It is typical of the Government that at
every opportunity they just throw dirt like this.
''Dr Mawhinney comes from Northern Ireland. There is a bi-partisan
policy on Northern Ireland which the Labour Party and the Conservative
Party are both keen to maintain.
''Dr Mawhinney should be a little more careful about throwing around
accusations about being soft on terrorism. He ought to know better.''
Meanwhile, Mr Lloyd has also claimed that a vendetta was being mounted
to deselect him because, more than 30 years ago, he gave evidence in
court against an anti-apartheid colleague who was subsequently executed.
Mr Lloyd, said: ''It is something I regret deeply. It is not something
I live with with any complacency.
''But I was under duress. I had been tortured, and gave evidence
against the man. What is happening is a distressing personal vendetta
which cannot have any political content.''

ON A hill in Uttar Pradesh, there is an old fort from which one can
watch the Ganges flowing into golden sunsets. During the Diwali, or
Festival of Light, the river sparkles with thousands of floating oil
lamps.
For Mark Tully, the former BBC correspondent in Delhi, they are
wondrous images that capture the essence of the country he has reported
from with distinction for more than 20 years. The river and the vast
plain around it, he asserts, are the heart of India.
Having monitored its pulse through a series of internal upheavals, he
is now concerned that it is deeply troubled, and may succumb to foreign
influences beyond its control. ''I am fearful,'' he says. ''There is
something that is unique about India, and I am very afraid that it will
be swept away.''
The danger he perceives is of India sacrificing its ancient culture
and religions on the altar of Western-style economic development. There
is growing unease in the land, he says, that old values may be lost and
that nothing substantial will replace them.
The winds of change have reached rural villages in Uttar Pradesh, the
scene of his latest book entitled The Heart of India. Tully leaves
readers to draw their own conclusions from his collection of short
stories about the impact of modernity on such communities. However, in a
series of lectures to members of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society
this week, he has been expressing a few of his own.
The essence of his argument, explained in an interview with The
Herald, is that the West must change its own priorities and attitudes if
the special character of India is to survive. ''Part of the problem is
that many Indians regard their country as a failure,'' he says.
''Because it is not a major economic power, there is a tendency to look
to the West and assume that it has all the answers. In reality, all we
have to offer is sterile materialism and a philosophy that all that
matters is economic growth. That is no substitute for values based on
ancient religions and a profound attachment to nature.''
The clash of cultures is most pronounced in rural areas, which Gandhi
and other great Indian statesmen regarded as the heart of their country.
There are difficulties in reconciling the Western work ethos with
village traditions that prohibit picking fruit after dark because the
trees are sleeping.
''In all change there is loss and gain,'' Tully says. ''But if we are
to preserve the best that is in India we have to change ourselves. I
believe that there is no hope for the survival of India as we know and
love it unless the West changes quite dramatically.''
It is time, he suggests, for the West to adopt a more sensitive
attitude to the world we live in, and thereby set a better example to
developing countries. The environment in particular deserves more
attention.
Tully tells a story of seeing an old Indian woman who had been brought
by her family to a holy place to die. ''Her family was all around her,
and she was lying there peacefully. One felt instinctively there was
nothing to be frightened about. There was a sense of something coming
after death. There was a serenity, and a marvellous wholeness about the
scene.''
The inference is that, as things stand, the West has possibly more to
learn from India about living in harmony with our surroundings than the
other way around.
Meanwhile, Tully is encouraged by positive aspects of change in his
adopted country -- notably in the caste system and the repression of
women. ''What is happening in modern India is the caste system is being
stood on its head, with the lower castes uniting to fight for basic
rights. It is also heartening to see Indian women finally beginning to
stand up for themselves.''
Tully's motive for writing the book is explained in an introduction:
''The best-known writing about modern India has for the most part
ignored the plight of the villagers who are losing their old moorings
and not finding new ones. Writers have concentrated on urban,
middle-class India. I hope these stories will do something to restore
the balance.''
Few foreigners are better qualified to write them. Born in Calcutta of
British parents, and allowed to roam the streets of Darjeeling as a
child, Tully returned to India in 1965 after a 20-year absence, and he
has lived there ever since. During his career as the BBC chief of bureau
in Delhi, he became a cult figure to millions of Indians who relied on
his impartial radio reports to learn what was happening in their vast
country.
Since resigning from the BBC last year, he has become a director of a
small radio station in Calcutta, and continues to present a weekly
programme on Radio 4. A Kiplingesque figure, he has found his spiritual
home in India and says he would be ''very disorientated'' if he had to
live anywhere else.
In the introduction to his book, he writes: ''It would need a poet to
describe what India means to me, and I am no poet.'' However troubled
the heart of India may be, Tully is happy to remain there.

Blair warns of evictions.
THOUSANDS of vulnerable people face poverty or eviction as a result of
a Government decision to tighten the rules on payment of housing
benefit, Mr Tony Blair claimed yesterday.
He told Mr Major in the Commons that the move was further evidence of
the Tory party's ''lurch to the right''.
The Prime Minister said his ''outrage was rather artificial'' as the
changes were approved by the Commons last July. Under guidelines issued
by Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley, councils will have less
discretion in topping up housing benefit payments.
Apart from exceptional cases they will not be able to advance more
than the average rent in any area plus half of any shortfall between
that and the actual rent.
Mr Blair said the changes ''will mean that thousands of vulnerable
people, pensioners, the disabled and families with young children will
lose help and face poverty and eviction''.
''How can this possibly be fair and isn't it the clearest evidence of
your party's lurch to the right and the death of one-nation
Conservatism.''
The Prime Minister replied: ''Indeed it is not. My party remains at
the centre of politics and that is where it will always be.''
Mr Blair said the housing benefit bill had risen because under this
Government housing investment had been slashed. He said the sensible
thing was to tackle the problem of private landlords charging excessive
rents ''head on'' rather than ''using vulnerable and innocent tenants as
pawns to clear up a mess of the Government's own making.''
Mr Major told him that if he had ''spent a single day in government''
he would know governments faced difficult decisions to control
expenditure.
''You said you were in favour of hand-ups not hand-outs and your party
has said they want to take a very radical look at the whole system of
social security to try and ensure money is spent in the best possible
way.
''And yet, whatever words they may say about physical control,
whenever there is a difficult decision to be made they will oppose it.''
Mr Blair said that Labour would not have slashed housing investment
and repeated his suggestion that it was the excessive rents being
charged by private landlords which needed to be tackled.
The Prime Minister said he took that as a Labour commitment to
renewing rent controls. Mr Blair shook his head.
Mr Major said that would cut private lettings while in the public
sector Labour would presumably keep rents artifically low thus pushing
up the level of borrowing and tax.
According to a leak of a Social Security Depoartment guidance document
local council are being asked to refer to the Shorter Oxford English
Dictionary to decide whether claimants qualify for ''exceptional
hardship'' payments.
About 850,000 people in private rented accomodation could be affected
by the new rules. Labour has suggested that only about six people in
each area will be able to qualify for extra hardship cash.
The Government's idea appears to be to drive down the level of private
rents to what they are willing to cover with benefit. Labour housing
spokesman Nick Raynsford said: ''This is the face of modern Conservatism
. It is a return to conditions as degrading as the worst aspects of the
Poor Law.''
* Scots campaigners yesterday warned that any move to scrap special
benefit payments for single parents would be ''a kick in the teeth'' for
them and their families.
They spoke out as a new UK-wide alliance of health, family and
children's welfare groups was launched to fight plans to axe the
payments.
At least 14 groups, ranging from The National Council for One Parent
Families to the Royal College of Nursing, have joined forces to warn
that withdrawal of the benefits would have ''disastrous consequences''
for more than two million children.
Government Ministers are reported to be considering axing the lone
parent benefit and allowance -- worth around #6 a week each -- as part
of the drive to curb the spiralling social security budget.
* The Glasgow alliance at the head of a national campaign to stop
industrial negligence compensation awards being clawed back from victims
by the department of social security yesterday welcomed Government
proposals to reverse the law.
However, the group called for legislation to be immediate and
retrospective, to prevent the futher ''ambush'' of successful claimants.
Negligence victims currently have to pay back the benefits they
receive from the date their compensation claim is made until it is
resolved.
Last November, Clydeside Action on Asbestos highlighted the case of
former shipyard worker Mr John Birnie who was awarded #40,000
compensation in 1994 and had #29,000 clawed back by the Compensation
Recovery Unit, set up in 1989.

THE board of Scottish Homes should resign if it cannot agree to allow
the agency's tenants a proper democratic choice when it comes to
choosing new landlords, Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson told
a housing conference in Glasgow yesterday.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth should instruct Scottish Homes to
end its policy of denying tenants the choice of their local council as a
future landlord, he said.
The housing agency is in the process of transferring all its stock to
new landlords but ballot papers show only one alternative, usually a
housing association.
Mr Robertson said unelected, appointed people should not have the
right to make crucial policy decisions on matters like landlord choice,
especially when this flew in the face of the views of the elected
representatives of the people.
A member of the Scottish Homes Board, Professor Duncan Maclennan, who
was present, told the conference that it had been the Goverment's
decision not to allow Scottish Homes tenants the option of moving to
local authorities unless the circumstances were exceptional.
The Shelter Scotland/Miller Partnerships conference at Glasgow's
Parish Hall was chaired by The Herald's economics editor Alf Young.

''MY party remains in the centre of the politics,'' the Prime Minister
declared yesterday. Where on earth then could the centre be one wondered
as his Question Time proceeded to resemble the happy days of Thatcherism
in the eighties when political issues were painted in stark colours --
red and blue or black and white. Mr Blair accused him of being a Sir
Jasper figure, the Victorian squire about to throw the poor, sick and
old on to the streets by cutting their housing benefit.
The Tories cheered rapturuously as Mr Ivan Lawrence (Burton -- Con)
praised the Government's plans to tighten up the rules on admitting
asylum-seekers, which the Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw had just
called ''the most crude playing of the race card I have ever seen''.
Mr Major laid into Mr Straw accusing him of arousing unnecessary
fears. He then laid into Mr Mike Watson (Glasgow Central -- Lab) who had
charged him with letting youngsters die to save the #15m cost of banning
the drug Temazepam completely. The depth to which some politicians sank
made him understand the low esteem in which the public held them, he
snapped.
Mr Major was in electioneering form which he might have to sustain for
18 months. He was out-done, at least in volume, by Mr David Evans, the
millionaire former football chairman who is the Tory equivalent of Mr
Dennis Skinner.
He roared out an indictment of the Opposition bringing in a verdict
that they were all ''men of straw'' and unsubtle reference to the Shadow
Home Secretary whose dismal performance in last week's prisons debate he
had rubbished in passing.
Mr Paddy Ashdown lamented increased overcrowding in school classrooms.
Mr Patrick Nicholls (Teignbridge -- Con) howled about the Labour threat
to the grammar schools.
In 15 minutes the fashionable idea that there is now not all that much
to choose between the two sides of the House was shot to pieces.
This probably pleased Mr Blair who seems to have moved on from phase
one of his campaign -- ''We're not that different from the Tories, just
newer and nicer'' -- to phase two -- ''We're the moderate party now, not
these Tories.''
The Conservatives are now busy being nasty to foreigners and grinding
the faces of the poor in a manner most politically satisfactory to the
man who has already claimed to have found the ''One Nation'' standard
lying in a ditch and rescued it. Yesterday he accused Mr Major of
throwing it away.
''Why not tackle the landlords and excessive rents?'' demanded One
Nation Blair. A wintry smile crept across Mr Skinner's face. The leader
was actually talking like a socialist but it wouldn't last, the
expression seemed to say.
Mr Major very nearly snapped ''Ah ha'' and, if he had possessed
moustaches would have twirled them in the best Sir Jasperish manner. ''I
am pleased to see you commit yourself to rent controls,'' he said
silkily.
This mad visionary would probably hold down rents artificially in the
public sector as well, declared a shocked Jasper Major. Then what would
happen? Taxes would have to go up.
The horror with which he delivered his lines did credit to a man whose
Government has raised taxes by the equivalent of 7p on the standard
rate.
It would all end in chaos because that was how a socialist government
always ended, he cried, producing a triumphant sort of negative
Crispin's Day roll call of Labour authorities Tories love to hate.
''Hackney, Lambeth, Tower Hamlets, Greenwick, Southwark, and
Islington,'' not quite as stirring as ''Warwick, Talbot, Salisbury, and
Gloucester,'' but serving its purpose. It didn't sound at all ecumenical
or one nation-ish.
Still Mrs Thatcher demonstrated in three elections that, for the
largest group of voters, the centre ground was further to the right than
Labour thought. Mr Major seems to be banking on the belief that it still
is.

Washington
THE United States and Russia have tentatively agreed that the Russians
should play a small, symbolic role in peacekeeping in Bosnia. About 2000
Russian soldiers will take part, but only as support troops, providing
air transport and communications services, and clearing mines.
They would not be involved in a combat role. They would not be under
Nato command, a point President Boris Yeltsin insisted on, but would
answer to the overall allied command -- which happens to be Nato.
The Americans have stood firm in their insistence that peacekeeping
must be under Nato command, with no interference from the UN. Mr Yeltsin
was obdurately opposed to allowing Russian troops to serve under the
Americans but still wanted to play some part in the operation.
Mr Clinton and Mr Yeltsin met in New York on Monday, but handed over
the question to their defence ministers. The proposal, which emerged
today, is a face-saving device for the Russians. It was discussed today
in Washington by William Perry, US Secretary of Defence, and General
Pavel Grachev, the Russian Defence Minister.
A further, equally symbolic, concession to Russian susceptibilities
was to be the postponement of the Bosnian peace talks to allow the
presidents of Bosnia, Croatia, and Yugoslavia to meet Mr Yeltsin in
Moscow. The peace talks were to begin in an American air base in Ohio on
Tuesday.
The timing of the meetings, like much else, has been put in doubt by
Mr Yeltsin's illness.
In a related matter, the Washington Post today reported the results of
a detailed investigation into the Srebrenica massacres last July. The
report directly implicated General Ratko Mladic, commander of the
Bosnian Serb army.
Survivors described an attempt by about 12,000 men from the enclave to
escape to government lines as the Serbs overwhelmed the place. Far fewer
than half survived the journey. The rest were killed in ambushes,
massacred on the spot, or were captured by the Serbs, and then killed.
Two survivors, who lay under a pile of bodies for several hours before
escaping, said that Mladic appeared at their detention site, assured
them that they would not be hurt, and asked them to get into trucks, to
be driven to government territory for a prisoner exchange.
They were taken to a warehouse, where they were packed like sardines
overnight. Mladic appeared again, to reassure them, and then they were
all taken out and shot.
The two men, from hiding, saw Mladic at the scene of the massacre.
The Red Cross has lists of some 8000 men who are missing, believed
murdered. The mayor of Srebrenica, who escaped, believes the total must
exceed 10,000.
ZAGREB: A British UN peacekeeper was killed yesterday and another was
seriously wounded in a weapons-related accident at a UN base in
north-central Bosnia.
Major Donald Roy, military spokesman for the UN mission in Zagreb,
said two British soldiers were involved in a weapon accident at Zepce
base.
''One soldier received head injuries and died later on. The other
suffered neck injuries and was taken to a medical facility in Zepce
where he is in serious condition,'' he said.
The dead soldier was named as Fusilier Gary Riches, 24, a single man
from Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He was serving with the Royal Fusiliers based
at Catterick, north Yorkshire.
The other soldier was understood to have suffered head injuries.
The Royal Military Police were investigating the incident, which was
thought to have been a tragic accident. A Ministry of Defence spokesman
said there was no involvement of the warring factions.
Fusilier Riches' body was expected to be taken home in the next few
days, to be determined by arrangements with the next of kin.

Reykjavik
AT LEAST 16 people were killed when an avalanche smashed into a tiny
village in north-west Iceland today, sweeping away houses in its path.
''Sixteen people have been found dead and we are still looking for
four people,'' said Johannes Reykdal, a spokesman for the emergency
services working in the fjord-side village of Flateyri.
Rescuers, working in blizzards, dug out 10 people alive, among them a
family of four. Their house was destroyed but they were unharmed.
Rescuers said there was a chance of finding more survivors.
A witness described seeing snow and houses rumbling by as he stood in
his kitchen. ''I saw the house next to mine come rushing past me,
completely intact,'' said Gunnar Valdimarsson.
The avalanche struck the village at 4am and buried 17 houses in snow
and ice. Flateyri, by a fjord in the remote north-west of Iceland, has
about 300 inhabitants.
Emergency teams with doctors and dogs used coastguard boats and
helicopters to reach Flateyri as its roads were blocked in the bad
weather.
The region suffers the severest conditions in Iceland's harsh winters
and last January was declared a danger zone because of the threat of
avalanches.
Iceland's Government called an extraordinary Cabinet meeting. ''Our
thoughts are with the people of Flateyri,'' said Justice Minister
Thorsteinn Palsson.--Reuter.

A REVOLT by traditionalist Tory MPs yesterday forced the Government
into major reconsideration of two Bills affecting families.
They claimed that the Domestic Violence Bill going through Parliament
and a new Divorce Bill to be introduced in the new session of Parliament
beginning next month contain provisions that would weaken the status of
marriage.
A deputation saw the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay, yesterday. He was
shaken by the strength of feeling they revealed.
He reported to the Cabinet which agreed that one Bill should be
shelved for a week for further consideration while on the other Tory MPs
will be allowed a free vote instead of being whipped to back the
Government.
The Family and Domestic Violence Bill had almost made it through
Parliament before the critics decided to block a provision that a woman
living with a man should have the same rights a married woman has if her
husband becomes violent, enabling the man to be evicted from the house.
This would apply even if the man owned the house and the partner had
no financial stake in it. A six-month occupation order would enable
victims to stay in the house and could be renewed by the courts.
One critic, Mr Roger Gale, MP for North Thanet, said the Bill as it
stood would allow a woman to have her partner evicted from his home
without even having to prove she had been subjected to violence.
Officials in the Lord Chancellor's office disputed this claim.
However, outside Parliament there was strong criticism of the threat
to the Bill from the charity NCH Action for Children. It said the Bill
would have offered valuable protection from domestic violence.
Neither Bill would apply in Scotland.
Mr Edward Leigh, MP for Harborough, said co-habitees should not have
the same rights as married people especially if there were no children
involved.
''The breakdown of the family is the number one problem facing our
nation and as a party we must not be seen to be doing anything to
undermine the institution of marriage,'' he said.
The Bill made progress because it was taken under a procedure for
dealing with non controversial Bills and that, too, annoyed opponents
although one admitted that they were to blame for not having spotted its
provisions earlier.
Tory MPs have also expressed strong concern to Lord Mackay about his
reforming Divorce Bill which halves the time needed to push through a
''no fault'' divorce from two years to one.
This is seen by them as making divorce easier, although its object is
to establish new procedures requiring couples to work out what should
happen to children and property and reconsider the decision to seek a
divorce before the 12 months are over.
The Cabinet decided to go ahead with the Bill which will be announced
in the Queen's Speech on November 15, but to allow a free vote of
Conservative MPs. With most Opposition MPs in favour this could allow
the Bill to win through.
Labour, which supported the Domestic Violence Bill, last night accused
the Government of giving in to ''an extremist rump''.
Labour's legal affairs spokesman Paul Boateng said that a long-overdue
measure was being sacrificed ''on the altar of internal Tory Party
politicking''.
Lord Mackay has agreed to consider amendments being drafted by Tory
MPs which will water down its provisions. One critic said: ''It is
effectively dead in the water.''
The Bill will probably receive its third reading in a fortnight.

BT must reduce the number of disconnections it makes which add up to
nearly 765,000 households a year, the Consumers' Association said
yesterday. The company was accused of having a ''dramatically higher''
disconnection rate than other utilities. But BT said customers were only
cut off as a last resort and that two thirds were re-connected almost
immediately when they paid their bill.

Montreal
THE future of a united Canada hung in the balance today as politicians
campaigned furiously to sway undecided voters in the final days before
Quebec votes on whether to separate.
Only weeks ago Quebec nationalists looked likely to suffer a certain
defeat in the October 30 referendum, but the battle has now been
transformed into an emotional fight to the finish that has bitterly
divided the world's second largest country.
The latest public opinion poll today gave the separatists a slight
lead among decided voters, 44.5 to 42.2%.
This means the race is a virtual dead heat, the CROP polling agency
said, but it assumed that two-thirds of the 13% undecided would recoil
from breaking up the country and vote against separation.
Distributing the undecided vote in this way would give the Canadian
unity side a narrow lead of 51% to 49% in the survey.
The Canadian dollar strengthened slightly after release of the poll
with some investors saying they believed support for separation had
peaked.
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien went on national television last
night, saying the country was in crisis and imploring Quebec's five
million voters to think long and hard before casting their ballots.
His voice cracking with emotion, Chretian asked Quebec voters: ''Do
you really think it is worth abandoning the country we have built, and
which our ancestors have left us? Do you really think it makes any sense
-- any sense at all -- to break up Canada?''
Separatist leader Lucien Bouchard launched an angry attack on Chretien
in his televised response, accusing him of treachery against Quebec in
helping patriate (transfer) the Canadian constitution from Britain in
1982 without Quebec's assent.
Bouchard held up a copy of the frontpage of a French-language
newspaper from before the patriation, showing Chretien, then Justice
Minister, laughing under a banner headline saying he and former Prime
Minister Pierre Trudeau had ''betrayed'' Quebec.
The constitution as patriated failed to enshrine special protection
for the French language and culture -- the so-called ''distinct
society'' clause. Quebec is the only province not to have consented to
the constitution.
Quebec voted 60-40% against separation in 1980 and polls a few weeks
ago predicted the nationalists would suffer a similar defeat this time,
perhaps ending for a generation any hope of an independent Quebec.
However the charismatic Bouchard effectively seized control of the
nationalist campaign earlier this month, and galvanised supporters with
speeches appealing to pride in the French language and culture.
Chretien and thousands of Canadians, alarmed by the separatist wave,
are desperately trying to turn the tide. Chretien will go on Quebec
television again today for an interview in French.
Tens of thousands of Canadians jammed airlines, trains, and buses to
rush to Montreal for a massive unity rally tomorrow.
In a sign of the passions separation has unleashed, some fans at a
home game of the idolised Montreal Canadiens ice hockey team booed
during the playing of ''O Canada'' last night while others stood proudly
and sang the national anthem.--Reuter.

ITALY'S Prime Minister Lamberto Dini survived a dramatic vote of
no-confidence today, snatching victory from the jaws of defeat with a
pledge to resign by the end of the year.
The Chamber of Deputies voted by 310 to 291 to reject a no-confidence
motion moved by former premier Silvio Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance.
Twenty-four Marxist MPs crucially withdrew support for the
centre-right motion after Dini promised to step down by December 31.
Dini told MPs that success for the motion, which could have
precipitated a snap General Election, would wreck Italy's
deficit-cutting budget and plunge the country into crisis.
Dini's government, installed in January as a stop-gap after
Berlusconi's stormy Cabinet collapsed, is backed by centre-left parties
defeated by the billionaire tycoon in the 1994 election.--Reuter.

THE increasing reality of drug culture in Scotland is of a ''swamp of
small-scale networks of supply'', the president of the Association of
Chief Police Officers of Scotland told a national drugs conference
yesterday.
Mr Roy Cameron, chief constable of Dumfries and Galloway, said at
Dunblane that while the shadows of the organised drug profiteers flitted
across the Scottish landscape, the supply networks were as likely to
feature the boy or the old man next door as the large-scale dealer.
''The drugs problem is not confined to the economically disadvantaged,
nor the criminally sophisticated,'' he said, ''but transcends the
affluent professional sector and reaches into sporting, social, and
recreational life with increasing ubiquity.''
Mr Cameron told 150 delegates from enforcement agencies both in the UK
and from abroad that, faced with an increasing level of recorded drug
offences, there was a danger that the behaviour the police were trying
to combat was being seen as a normal and irreversible feature of modern
society.
That view was perhaps understandable because people could become
numbed by statistics which suggest that, in any one year, at least 6% of
the population took an illegal drug, that the toll of deaths directly
related to drug abuse continued to rise, while at least 24% of young
people had experimented with cannabis.
The police witnessed daily the direct link between drugs and crime not
only in inner-city areas but across all our urban and rural communities.
Society at large as well as Scotland's young people were the victims.
Some people might turn the argument round and contend that drug abuse
was a symptom and not the disease, with individuals the victims of
social change as much as the subjects of drug abuse. There was a
perception of a general spectre of social decline in which conventional
concepts of personal responsibility had been abandoned for more bizarre
behaviour and this had been variously ascribed to a diverse range of
pressures on our society.
Mr Cameron added: ''There may well be insights in these views but
equally the dark force of crime without frontiers and without scruples
cannot be ignored . . . as organised crime and criminal rivalries
intrude upon international life and institutions like a fifth estate of
the realm.''
There was strong hope for the future in Scotland in the concept of
multi-agency drug action teams which offer the chance of a more coherent
and sustainable attack on the problem.

THE current fleet of Ro-Ro ferries should be scrapped and replaced
with a new, safer design, a Glasgow university naval architecture expert
suggested yesterday.
Mr Ian Winkle told a conference in Aberdeen that current developments
in safety started from the assumption that the current Ro-Ro ferry
concept was safe -- something he challenged.
The ''quick-fix'' approach was, not unnaturally, led by the owners and
operators with a large investment tied up in existing ships, who were
reluctant to see such vessels removed from service, he said.
He told the Leith International Conference that the safety of the
vessels was largely because of good operational practice.
Yesterday, he put forward his ''Glasgow Concept'', which he first
revealed eight years ago and which he said would have prevented
disasters like the Estonia and Herald of Free Enterprise and, in the
long term, was an economic solution.
Mr Winkle, a senior lecturer at the Department of Naval Architect and
Ocean Engineering, pointed out that when the Princess Victoria went down
in the Irish Sea in 1953 with the loss of 134 of the 172 passengers and
crew, it took five hours to sink. When the Herald of Free Enterprise
went down in 1987 with the loss of 193 of its 539 passengers and crew,
it took just 90 seconds to sink.
He said new regulations currently at the proposal stage were, as he
understood them, simply ''tinkering with the design of existing
Ro-Ros''.
''There is a lot of commercial pressure not to scrap the existing
Ro-Ro fleet. It is a very valuable commodity and it is very expensive to
build new ships, so there is an obvious reason why people would like to
improve what they have got,'' he said.
''What I am suggesting goes far beyond what is being proposed.''
He said his novel concept would greatly enhance survival capability.
Fundamental to their design was that the vehicle spaces could be
flooded, together with some of the wing spaces, and there would still be
sufficient buoyancy in the remainder of the ship to keep it stable.
He said the new design would probably add little more than 5% to the
cost of a new ship, which might cost more than #50m, but design studies
to evaluate the additional costs were currently being carried out.
He said the long-term costs would be no greater than those of partial
solution to the problem which was currently being looked at.
The Glasgow Concept maintains the fundamental Ro-Ro concept of clear,
open vehicle decks requiring no subdivision or internal watertight ramp
systems.
* SPEED will be vital in any emergency in the new oil province to the
West of Shetland, Mr Bob Driver, HM Coastguard regional controller for
Scotland, warned yesterday.
He said the distance to the new fields and the weather extremes in the
Atlantic created new problems. Recently, a coastguard helicopter which
went to the aid of a fishing vessel, took 63 minutes on the outward
journey and just 18 for the inward.
He urged oil operators: ''If there is a major incident out there, we
must be aware of it almost before it happens.''
He said that in the new province, from which oil is scheduled to start
flowing early next year, they would experience weather conditions which
haven't been encountered in the North Sea.
''If the aircraft can't land, we are totally dependent on winch-fitted
aircraft. We have them in Sumburgh, which is 70 or 80 miles, Stornoway,
which is 150 miles, and Lossiemouth, which is 160 miles. It is all time,
and that is the message I want to get across.''

A PSYCHIATRIC patient was found hanged after two nurses tied her apron
strings to a toilet pipe so they could go for lunch, a disciplinary
hearing was told yesterday.
Ms Katrina Wingfield, solicitor to the United Kingdom Central Council
for Nursing, Midwifery, and Health Visiting, told its professional
conduct committee that 43-year-old Miss A died on the Erica Ward of
Stallington Hall Hospital, Stoke on Trent, on May 13, 1992.
It is alleged that staff nurse Wendy McGuigan, 29, from Argyll, and
charge nurse Caroline Stockley, 30, later devised a plan to cover up the
incident.
Mrs Stockley denies failing to ensure Miss A's safety and wellbeing by
leaving her unattended. She admits agreeing to give an inaccurate
account of the circumstances in which Miss A had been secured on the
toilet.
Mrs McGuigan, who is not attending the hearing, denies tying Miss A to
the inlet pipe, leaving her unattended, and giving an inaccurate account
of the circumstances in which she had been left secured on the toilet.
Health care worker Mandy Jebson earlier told the hearing it was common
practice at the hospital to hook Miss A to the toilet by her apron to
stop her from falling, particularly if the hospital was short staffed.
Mrs Elaine Smith, who was acting sector manager at the time of the
incident said staff, including Mrs Stockley and Mrs McGuigan were very
distressed by the death. She told them there would be an investigation
and that they must tell the truth.
Cross-examined by Mr Robert Wilshaw of the health workers' union,
Unison, for Mrs Stockley, Mrs Smith insisted she had not known of any
policy to secure Miss A to the toilet.
The hearing continues.

MORE than 7000 West Lothian residents were told to boil their water
yesterday after traces of E Coli and coliform bacteria were detected in
the supply.
Lothian Regional Council has launched an inquiry into the
contamination. Severe weather the previous evening which created a power
cut causing temporary equipment failure is believed to have led to the
pollution.
An emergency helpline has also been set up for concerned consumers in
the area and GPs across the district have been alerted.
A spokeswoman for the council stressed the bacteria was not the deadly
0157 strain, which claimed the life of a toddler following contamination
by the bacteria in West Lothian last year. She said there had been no
reports of illness resulting from the pollution.
The contamination was discovered during routine daily testing at the
Kirknewton supply tanks yesterday.
Householders in Mid Calder, East Calder, Kirknewton, Pumpherston, and
part of Balerno, near Edinburgh, have been affected.
The council spokeswoman said chlorine had been added to the supply and
that, as a precautionary measure, all water for consumption and food
preparation should be boiled in a covered container until further
notice.
''The instruction to boil water is likely to remain in place for one
or two days until the water supply is safe to drink.
''There will be increased sampling of the water until the supply
returns to normal. We will review the position tomorrow morning when the
results of further sample tests will be available,'' she said.
In August 1994, more than 80,000 homes in East Lothian were hit by a
contamination scare after similar organisms were discovered in the
district's water treatment works.
Three years ago, homes in West Lothian were affected after raw sewage
was poured into a water tank. More than 100,000 householders were urged
to boil water after the pollution was detected in July 1994.
An emergency helpline has been set up on 0645 414415.

A NEW, low-cost air service between Prestwick and London was saved at
the eleventh hour after objections from other airlines.
The Herald has learned that high-level political talks took place less
than 36 hours before Ryanair was due to begin its service from the
Ayrshire airport to London Stansted.
It had originally intended to operate the service in conjunction with
GB Air but objections to the deal were lodged with the Civil Aviation
Authority and Department of Transport.
Throughout Tuesday, meetings involving senior airline and airport
officials, with the backing of Ayr MP Phil Gallie, were held in London.
Late on Tuesday, following final discussions with Junior Transport
Minister Lord Goshen, the airline was given the go-ahead.
The inaugural flight of the new service began yesterday, offering #59
return fares between the two airports. Until November 6, Ryanair will
operate the service under the cabotage rules which allow foreign
airlines to operate in the UK.
It is understood this is the first such allowance to be given to an
airline in these circumstances and follows the failure of the airline to
push through the GB Air agreement.
Objections to the deal had been lodged by British Midland, Air UK, and
British World Airways, each of which said that it would have set an
unacceptable precedent and that only UK airlines should be operating on
the sector.
British Midland also threatened Ryanair with legal action over its use
of the designation Glasgow Prestwick in its advertising and promotional
material. The service will continue under the temporary rules, with
Ryanair linking the service with Dublin, but there will be no
substantial change to the schedules between Prestwick and Stansted.
In the coming weeks, the airline's UK division hopes to be fully
registered and to be given an airline operator's certificate covering
routes within the UK.
It is understood that this week's talks involved Mr Gallie, former
defence secretary Lord Younger, senior officials of Ryanair, and airport
operators PIK.
Mr Hugh Lang, the airport's managing director said: ''It was touch and
go whether or not the service would start today but we pressed ahead
with ticket sales and marketing in the hope that a solution could be
found.''
He added: ''It is a major disappointment to us that airlines should
attempt in this way to stifle competition by any means they can. It is a
particular disappointment that British Midland, who have always
portrayed themselves as champions of competition and free enterprise,
should make not one but two attempts to do this new service down.''
Mr Tim Jeans, chief executive of Ryanair UK, said: ''We had a few
sleepless nights in the last week or so as rival airlines attempted to
stifle our genuine attempts to give air passengers between Scotland and
London a new choice at a reasonable cost.''
Ryanair is offering a no-frills service between Prestwick and Stansted
four times a day, with prices ranging from #59 to #99 return with the
bulk of the fares at the lower level.

New look at events before PC's death.
THE death of a police officer at the hands of a schizophrenic teenager
put the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland at odds with the
Government yesterday over the care of psychiatric patients in the
community.
A report by the commission into the circumstances leading up to the
death of Constable Lewis Fulton in Glasgow on June 17 last year
criticises legislation which will limit health workers' powers to ensure
patients are taking their medication.
After Mr Fulton's death from stabbing, Philip McFadden, then 18, was
remanded for trial but found to be insane and committed to the State
Hospital at Carstairs where he will be 20 today.
The report also criticises a GP, Dr Stewart Russell, who refused to
attend when McFadden's mother, Mary, phoned the local practice seeking
help after her son armed himself with a knife and began making violent
threats.
Dr Russell was contacted by the practice manager and indicated that
under no circumstances would he go into a hostage situation, having been
assaulted by the drunken father of a sick child some years previously.
He said it was a matter for the police.
The report states: ''We criticise Dr Russell's actions as insufficient
fully to meet his obligations as a GP towards Philip McFadden. We think
it would have been appropriate for him to have attended at the house
with the protection and assistance of the police.
''Even if, in the present climate of concern about violence to GPs, he
felt disinclined to attend, in reaching a decision he should have
attempted to acquire more knowledge about Philip . . . There is no
evidence that he did this, nor did he discuss personally with the police
the handling of the matter.''
The Scottish Health Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, said the
legislation met concerns about the legality of prolonged use of the
current leave of absence arrangements and the implications of the
European Convention on Human Rights.
The chairman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Scottish Division,
Dr Robin McCreadie, said: ''If a patient refuses to continue medication,
he can be brought back into hospital, but the new legislation means that
that will only apply for the first year after discharge. After that he
can only be brought back if there is evidence his condition has
deteriorated.
''This may make it difficult to maintain some patients in the
community, but we are happy that the majority of schizophrenic patients
are getting adequate care and being well served.''
Luke Fulton, who was born seven months before his father's death, will
be two next week. He still points to pictures around the house of his
father in uniform and says ''Daddy''.
His mother Christine said yesterday: ''It is just a word to Luke. He
is too young to understand what it means, but he heard the word
policeman the other week and responded with 'Daddy'.''
Mrs Fulton, 35, met her husband through their work, when she was a
store detective in a Glasgow city centre store. She is from Billingham
in the North of England.
Her husband's parents, Lewis and Gette, who live in Ayrshire, were
devastated by his death, said Mrs Fulton.
''He was their only child -- their lives revolved round him. He was
genuinely one of the nicest men you could hope to meet, and I will love
him and miss him for the rest of my life.''
Mrs Fulton added: ''I do not now, nor have I ever, blamed Philip
McFadden for the death of my husband. He is a very sick young man who
for various reasons did not have control over what he was doing.
''I accept the junior psychiatric team did the best they could for
him. I feel his mother did too little too late, but I also understand
that a mother's instinct to protect her son is strong and I accept that
she would do things differently now.''
Some of the report's recommendations for better guidance for GPs and
police officers about dealing with mental patients are already under
way.
Strathclyde Chief Constable Leslie Sharp said: ''It is a very
difficult thing to train anyone how to recognise people who are mentally
ill, but we have a training package together.
''We will start next month by training the trainers, and it may be the
new year before the police on the streets feel the benefit. They will be
looking out for signs and symptoms of mental illness.''
Mr Sharp said he believed there was nothing in the report which would
make his officers feel safer on the streets, but, he believed, practical
measures such as the provision of side-handled batons and ballistic
jackets would enhance police confidence.

SCOTTISH Forestry Minister Lord Lindsay yesterday predicted that
future timber production would double in the next 20 years.
Speaking at the launch of the Forestry Commission's annual report in
Edinburgh, Lord Lindsay said Britain's forests produced around six
million cubic metres of softwood each year.
''Towards the end of this year, we will have a new forecast of future
timber production which is expected to confirm earlier forecasts that
production will more than double over the next 20 years. This represents
a marvellous resource of which we can be proud,'' he said.
Earlier, Mr Robin Cutler, director general of the Forestry Commission,
revealed 1994/95 had been a record-breaking year for timber production.
''Thanks to better market conditions and increased demand from users
of small roundwood, we sold a total of 4,300,000 cubic metres. This, in
turn, resulted in an increase in our income from timber, compared with
the previous year, of almost #7m,'' Mr Cutler said.
* Lord Lindsay confirmed a decision over the future role of the
Forestry Commission would be made by the end of the year. It has already
been agreed that the commission's woodlands would remain in the public
sector, with Forest Enterprise established as an executive agency of the
commission.

Moscow
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin personifies Russia's unsteady march towards
democracy and its search for a role in the post-Cold War world.
The Russian leader has survived many crises and changed dramatically
in four turbulent years that have taken their toll on his health and
cast doubt on his prospects for a second term in office.
His admission to hospital today follows a strenuous visit to France
and the United States, where he appeared good-humoured and vigorous. He
even challenged French President Jacques Chirac to tennis ''to see who
is the fittest''.
However, the Yeltsin of October 1995 is a very different person from
the man who climbed on to a tank in August 1991 to defy a hard-line
coup.
Then he looked healthy and fit, spoke off-the-cuff, and symbolised the
Soviet Union's struggle for democracy. After being discharged from
hospital last July 24 after an earlier heart attack, he tried to revive
that robust image.
He put on a vigorous performance at a Kremlin news conference last
month before leaving on a long holiday at the Black Sea resort of Sochi,
where he was pictured playing tennis and receiving a stream of guests.
However in recent years Yeltsin, whose five-year term is due to end
next June, has often appeared puffy-faced, walking unsteadily and
slurring his words.
Aides deny he has a drink problem or that illness affects his
performance, but some critics say Yeltsin is showing increasing signs of
strain. They point to occasional slip-ups or unexpected replies to
questions.
Before leaving for France this month, Yeltsin announced that he
planned to replace Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, only to contradict
himself the following day by saying the appointment of a good deputy
could resolve the problem.
He also described the bloody war in Chechnya as ''the biggest
disappointment of my entire presidency'', but his tenure in the Kremlin
was blood-stained well before he launched that action: it was Yeltsin
who sent tanks to crush a rebellion led by his parliamentary opponents
back in October 1993.
Yeltsin, 64, has lost much of the charisma he had as a maverick in the
perestroika period. Then he gloried in his role as the pugnacious rival
of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Now, like Gorbachev before him,
his popularity is low.
He built much of his political career on confrontation, constructing
an image of a strong-willed decisive leader.
When Gorbachev brought him to Moscow in 1985, Yeltsin rose quickly to
become a junior member of the party Politburo -- then the highest power
in the land.
However his demands for faster reform and his forceful style lost him
favour and in 1988 he was sacked. He suffered a nervous breakdown at the
time after a humiliating showdown with party leaders led by Gorbachev.
In July 1990 he gambled again, storming out of the Communist Party
which for decades was the only route to political power in the Soviet
Union. The risky move increased his popularity.
In June 1991 he won some 57% of the votes in Russia to become its
first executive president.--Reuter.

A NINE-year-old boy died in a blazing empty tenement after three older
boys set fire to it, a death inquiry heard yesterday.
One of the youths claimed they shouted a warning to Craig Bottley on
the top floor.
The 13-year-old told a fatal accident inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff
Court: ''Craig shouted back, 'Wait till I put this ball of string in my
pocket'.'' Then he and the other two boys climbed out a first floor
window and ran away thinking Craig was behind them.
However, Craig was trapped as flames and smoke billowed through the
building in Balgair Street, Possilpark, Glasgow last October.
His parents had watched as firemen brought down his body, unaware that
it was their son.
The three boys appeared in court accused of culpable homicide but the
Crown later dropped the charges.
The inquiry heard how the boys climbed up a drain pipe, kicked in a
window screen, and started to vandalise the flats.
Yesterday, the 13-year-old told Mr Alastair Kennedy, leading the
evidence, that he saw one boy setting fire to a settee. He agreed he
helped prop up the settee so that the fire would catch quicker.
Then they left after one boy shouted a warning to Craig, who had gone
upstairs to see if there was anything worth taking.
The boy said they ran from the blazing building thinking Craig would
follow and agreed he took part in pestering firemen who arrived.
The inquiry continues.

<HEADLINE>Labour onslaught on 52% rise in crime in Scotland</HEADLINE>

<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>975683888</RECORDNO>

THE number of reported crimes in Scotland has increased by 52% since
1979 despite the 16 years of Conservative promises to tackle increasing
lawlessness, Labour claimed yesterday, as it announced the launch of an
autumn campaign on law and order.
Research carried out for deputy Shadow Scottish Secretary John McFall
has found that armed robberies in Scotland have risen by 129% in recent
years, from 157 in 1985 to 359 in 1994.
The number of crimes in which a pistol or revolver were used rose by
47%, from 49 offences in 1993 to 72 in 1994, while the number involving
imitation firearms rose by 60% in the same period.
And non-sexual violent crimes rose from 10,025 in 1979, when the
Tories came to power, to 19,774 last year. Motor vehicle offences have
increased by 62% over the same period.
Mr McFall said: ''These figures give the lie to the claim that the
Conservatives are the party of law and order. Although there have been
recent welcome improvements in crime figures, the Tory record since 1979
is absolutely dismal.''
The research was provided by the House of Commons Social Research
Division from Scottish Office figures, which reminded Labour in its
submission that ''not all crime taking place is reported to or recorded
by the police so the figures may not reflect trends in actual crime''.
The figures show that although reported crime rose overall between
1979 and 1994 by 52%, from 346,680 incidents to 527,064, since 1990
reported crime has fallen by 2%.
Mr McFall claimed Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth had admitted the
Government's failure to tackle rising crime in an article he wrote for
the Catholic newspaper Flourish, in which he said: ''When parents dare
not let their children go out to play. . .then we have reached a point
where action must be taken.''
Mr McFall added: ''How come things have got so bad in the first place?
After all the Tories have been in power for the past sixteen years. If
they haven't cracked crime by now, they never will.''
In reply, Scottish Home Affairs Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton
said tackling crime remains at the top of the Government's agenda. ''We
continue to be greatly encouraged by the fact that the number of
recorded crimes in Scotland has fallen for a third successive year.''
He added: ''Further reductions remain a major concern for the
Government. We know that crime remains a reality for many people and,
while we hope to see some more falls in recorded crime, the Government's
uncompromising stance against lawlessness will not falter.''

WHEN in the space of a few days Boris Yeltsin managed to pinch the
backs of two of his secretaries, humiliate his Foreign Minister in
public, engulf the UN Secretary General in a bear-hug, and sour
East-West harmony over the Bosnia peace plan, it was thought that
Russia's president was back on form after several weeks of gloomy
inactivity.
However the announcement that instead he is back in hospital suffering
apparently from a recurrence of a heart complaint almost certainly means
that at the age of 64 -- which happens to be eight years past the
average age of death for the Russian male -- Yeltsin will not be
managing Russia's affairs from the Kremlin for much longer. And that
almost certainly means he will not now be running next June for a second
term as Russian president.
Despite the Kremlin spokeman insisting that Yeltsin was not about to
quit, his illness -- brought on by exhaustion, or more probably by
alcohol -- raises a question about whether Russia has the ability to
cope with an unexpected change of leadership. What is clear is that the
outlook is far more optimistic than in 1991 and 1993, which were also
times of uncertainty.
When Yeltsin prevented hard-line communists from seizing power from
Mikhail Gorbachev, he promptly emerged as a leader of undisputed moral
authority, the only prominent political figure promising sweeping
economic and social reforms. Had he failed, there would have been a
bitter and possibly bloody power struggle between reformers and die-hard
opponents in the Russian Parliament.
Two years ago, when he suddenly and viciously battered his enemies
into submission by destroying the Duma building, the political scene was
also uncertain. However Yeltsin went on to create an extremely powerful
executive presidency and proceeded largely to ignore the new, much
weaker parliament, and to ridicule its calls for his impeachment.
The Russian electorate approved his remodelled system in the December
1993 referendum -- and given the extraordinary election success of the
extreme nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, it was a good thing he did.
There was no sudden political turmoil, Yeltsin continued running the
country, and Zhirinovsky's appeal declined as economic conditions
improved.
Russia's future is not now tied so closely to Yeltsin's fortunes
although, and in spite of his erratic behaviour and the steady erosion
of his popularity, he has been and is seen to be the most powerful man
in the country.
However other politicians have grown in stature, notably Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the Prime Minister originally written off as a step
backward on the reform road and a man even likely to turn the clock back
to the Cold War in relations with the West.
Chernomyrdin has emerged as Yeltsin's heir apparent, continuing with
the privatisation of state industries, consulting with the International
Monetary Fund, and befriending leading American politicians. He has also
managed to distance himself from the military's crude use of force in
the Chechen conflict.
With Yeltsin's backing, Chernomyrdin has also created a centre-right
electoral bloc, Our Home Is Russia, with its platform predictably all
about the need for law and order. The bloc will contest December's
parliamentary elections and could serve as a vehicle for Chernomyrdin's
presidential ambitions.
While Yeltsin was strutting on the global stage in New York, his
enemies were busy organising themselves to join the battle against him
and Chernomyrdin in December. It is already clear however that if these
elections do take place -- and there is no reason for a fit Yeltsin to
cancel them -- they will be a huge political mess. The proliferation of
parties, almost 300 at the last count, has meant the formation of blocs
in order to gather the necessary signatures required to run.
This will mean a bewildering choice for an already disenchanted,
alienated and confused electorate, and there is already some doubt that
the 25% turn-out required to validate the poll may not be achieved. And
several other heavyweight contestants are already competing with each
other to assert Russia's power, deplore the loss of the Soviet Empire,
decry the West, and pander to nationalist sentiment.
Russian opinion polls are notoriously unreliable but they are
suggesting that the Russian Communist Party will do well by presenting a
simple and familiar option for millions, especially the elderly.
Russia's economic outlook is increasingly promising with inflation
curbed and productivity rising at last, but the old and the poor have
undoubtedly suffered.
At the same time, the strident nationalism of Zhirinovsky still has
its appeal even if the threat of a Liberal Democratic Party government
remains unlikely.
There is also a new party led by the retired General Alexander Lebed.
However well his Congress of Russian Communities Party performs in the
elections, the general is a household name and a potential presidential
candidate with a reputation as a blunt and honest man opposed to
corruption, crime, and economic hardship.
There can be no doubt that if Yeltsin has to give up his post through
ill health there will be a renewal of the struggle to revise the
constitution and restore powers to the Duma. Russia has not yet achieved
mature political stability, but it is getting there.

THE Cabinet battle to reduce state spending is delaying final
decisions about legislation for the new session of Parliament on
November 15.
The Chancellor needs to know precisely how much is to be cut from the
#90bn social security budget and how this is to be tackled in the
Commons.
Yesterday the Cabinet reviewed the programme for the Queen's Speech
for next year, which could prove to be the run-up to a General Election.
The Chancellor now handles spending and taxation in the same Budget
statement on November 28.
The Cabinet could not finalise this programme concerning the number of
Bills required because of the uncertainties on public expenditure. The
Cabinet is scheduled to settle this next Thursday, but the spending
Ministers are still fighting hard to maintain their departmental
budgets.
The Chancellor is due to chair two more meetings of the Cabinet
Expenditure Committee next week before the final decisions are made by
the full Cabinet.
This year the Prime Minister is determined to reduce actual spending,
rather than merely reducing the increase in state spending.
The kind of cuts now being proposed by the Treasury go way beyond
savings that might be incurred by cutting out waste and benefit fraud.
New regulations concerning housing benefits were set in frame by the
Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley last June. Yesterday Labour was
re-launching its attack on the Government in this issue on the grounds
that changes effect those on the threshold of poverty.

ENGLAND cricketer Phillip DeFreitas yesterday accepted substantial
undisclosed High Court libel damages over a magazine article which
questioned his commitment.
The West Indian-born Derbyshire all-rounder was not in court to hear
his solicitor Paul Hackney tell Mr Justice Morland of the great offence
caused by the item, illustrated with his photograph, in the July issue
of Wisden Cricket Monthly.
Headed ''Is it in the blood?'', the article suggested England players
of overseas origin, particularly West Indians or Asians, would lack real
commitment and would be motivated solely by a desire for personal
advancement and achievement.
Counsel Rupert Elliott said publishers Wisden Cricket Magazines Ltd
and the magazine's editor dissociated themselves entirely from the
allegations, made by an independent contributor.
They had already published an apology and were happy to repeat it in
public. They had agreed to pay DeFreitas damages and his legal costs.
The award is understood to be larger than the #25,000 reported to have
been accepted by DeFreitas's England and Derbyshire colleague, Devon
Malcolm, from the magazine.

THE Lord Advocate, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, has been asked to
explain why Scottish Office Ministers have refused to answer questions
on his activities, in a move which reflects the growing frustration of
MPs at what they see as the erosion of Government accountability.
Mr Jim Wallace, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats and MP for
Orkney and Shetland, has written to Lord Rodger in protest after the
Scottish Office passed his Parliamentary question on prosecutions of
illegal dumping from ships in Scottish waters to the Department of
Transport.
A Transport Minister in turn passed his question to the Coastguard
Agency, claiming it referred to an ''operational matter'' outwith
ministerial responsibility.
The Government's Next Steps programme has seen a variety of Government
functions, from motor vehicle licencing to research laboratories, handed
over to semi-autonomous agencies controlled by appointed chief
executives. Questions about their activities from MPs are being
increasingly passed by Ministers to the official concerned.
Mr Wallace claims the language used echoes that used last week by Home
Secretary Michael Howard when he claimed that the sacking of the
Parkhurst prison governor was an ''operational matter'' for the director
general of the Prison Service and not a ''policy matter'' for ministers.
In his letter to Lord Rodger Mr Wallace states: ''I am writing to you
to express my concern that the Parliamentary accountability of the Lord
Advocate, slender as it is in the House of Commons, is being further
eroded.''
He asks: ''Can you clarify whether the Crown Office or the relevant
procurator-fiscal is responsible for any prosecution in Scotland
relating to the illegal discharging of pollutants from vessels in
Scottish waters or whether this is in fact an 'operational matter' to be
determined by the Coastguard Agency?
''Were you indeed aware that a question which I had tabled relating to
prosecutions in Scotland had been transferred by the Scottish Office to
the Department of Tansport, and if so, can I ask why the Scottish Office
declined to answer the question which was prima facie within your
responsibilities?''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said he and his colleagues had faced similar
problems, with Ministers refusing to answer a succession of questions on
education and fisheries.
Last week Angus East MP Andrew Welsh tabled a question to Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth on student grants and received a formula reply
from Education Minister Raymond Robertson which read: ''These are
operational matters for the Student Loan Company Ltd. I have asked the
Chief Executive to write to the honourable Member.''
Mr Salmond said: ''It's an increasing problem that is angering MPs who
find that any semblance of ministerial accountability to the legislature
is being lost when ministers dodge questions by passing on their mail to
executive agencies. Increasingly Ministers are acting as postmen as
opposed to accountable decision makers.''

CHEESEMAKER Humphrey Errington reckons he has friends in the council
which is trying to destroy #60,000 worth of Lanark Blue cheese.
He recently launched a nationwide quiz competion to boost his funds
for fighting an action brought by Clydesdale district.
He stopped short of selling the tickets in the council offices -- but
he said yesterday: ''I believe I have supporters in the council despite
officials on it who are trying to ruin my business.''
Asked if he would sell the booklets straight to Clydesdale district
employees, he said: ''Not directly but I have sympathisers working on
the council and they'll buy them at the outlets.''
Mr Errington said that the #2-a-head postcards containing questions
about the blue cheese are being sold over the counter in food outlets
nationwide.
The move comes after he announced that, even if he won his case, he
will still not be able to pay the #100,000 legal costs. The competition
could raise #150,000.
Mr Errington won a court order banning Clydesdale from carrying out
test sampling of this year's stock after a sheriff said that would have
been tantamount to harrassment.
Mr Robert Steenson, the council's principal environmental health
officer, criticised claims of council support and said: ''I don't want
to make any comment on how Mr Errington is raising money for the
action.''
Clydesdale's application for an order to condemn nearly 5 tonnes of
cheese resumes on Monday.

THE Glasgow Royal Concert Hall saga took another twist last night when
it emerged that a third artist has been hit by the murals jinx.
The Herald has discovered that a 120ftx8ft mural commissioned in
October 1993 from artist Helen McLean has been dumped underneath the
concert hall stage after being hidden in a cloakroom for 20 months.
Ms McLean, who studied fine art at Lancaster University, was
commissioned to paint the five-section mural on trains and boats and
planes to coincide with a celebration the concert hall was running on
that theme in 1994.
She did the work in close consultation with concert hall director
Cameron McNicol but, after many promises, her work remains hidden from
public view.
When the work was completed in February 1994, Ms McLean was told it
would be erected immediately. Nothing happened. The next date proposed
was autumn 1994.
Ms McLean, who was paid about #7000 for the mural, claims she was then
told that the concert hall could not afford the aluminium supports to
hang the mural on the second floor wall facing Buchanan Bus Station.
Since then, Mr McNicol has refused to be pinned down, she said.
Then, two weeks ago, she found out that four murals -- by the
so-called New Glasgow Boys: Steven Campbell, Ken Currie, Adrian
Wiszniewski, and Peter Howson -- were to be hung.
Like many who have had a brush with the concert hall, Ms McLean feels
she has been treated badly and has queried the potential waste of money.
She said: ''I felt my mural was something the people of Glasgow could
enjoy and relate to. The city should be allowed to get some benefit from
them, somewhere, somehow. I feel it is a great pity that Cameron McNicol
has not allowed my work to be viewed by the public.
''The mural is one of my best pieces but, because I'm not a well-known
artist, they have pushed me under the carpet and I feel really angry
about it.
''Friends who have taken a guided tour of the concert hall have asked
to see them and been met with blind panic on the faces of people they
have asked.''
Last night, a concert hall spokesman dismissed the idea of a jinx.
''You and I both know that is nonsense. However, we have not had best of
luck with the murals.''
They had intended putting it outside on a hoarding but imminent
building work had prevented this. He could not say why it had not been
hung inside as Miss McLean had been led to believe it would.
''The mural was genuinely liked. There is no conspiracy. I think an
appropriate site will be found for it.''
Councillor Pat Lally said the mural, which he had both seen and liked,
would go on show at an appropriate occasion. ''We don't buy things and
not show them.''
Five years ago, the jinx hit Lenzie artist Ian McCulloch when his
murals, commissioned by Strathclyde Regional Council to symbolise its
involvement in the #34m concert hall project, were ignominiously taken
down on the instructions of Councillor Lally.
Two weeks ago, the jinx struck artist Peter Howson. Along with
Campbell, Currie, and Wiszniewski, Howson agreed to contribute one
mural. However, he painted himself into a tight corner at the concert
hall because his canvas was the wrong shape.
When the 10ft x 8ft canvas arrived in Howson's studio, it is believed
he assumed that, being a mural, it would require a horizontal shape,
which he duly provided. In fact, the murals are to be fitted together in
pairs, vertically.
A gap awaits his second attempt.

<TEXT>
THE Scottish National Party's environment spokesperson, Ms Roseanna
Cunningham MP, yesterday criticised the proposed scope of a marine
survey intended to help solve the mystery of the munitions which have
been washed up on Scottish beaches.
The survey, announced by the Government on Tuesday, will concentrate
on the official munitions dump site at Beaufort's Dyke in the Irish Sea
and the area between it and a British Gas pipeline.
Ms Cunningham expressed disappointment at suggestions that the survey
was simply a routine exercise which was being brought forward, and
called for a more thorough operation covering a wider area.
''There is enough evidence now for people to feel near certain that
there has been a lot of fly dumping of munitions in much shallower
waters. What is actually needed is a detailed mapping of the whole area,
as a start.''
Ms Cunningham also yesterday launched an SNP campaign aimed at
preventing the reprocessing of American-originated spent nuclear fuel at
Dounreay.
She said the US authorities were considering sending between 5000 and
15,000 spent fuel rods to the Caithness plant.
This ould result in more than 500 shipments of weapons-grade nuclear
waste travelling the length of Scotland, she said.
''It is astounding that a decision of such profound, long-term
importance to Scotland should be made in another country, without any
reference to Scotland.

TYCOON Robert Maxwell flew into a towering rage when he discovered
fellow directors had been meeting behind his back, a court was told
yesterday.
Before the board meeting of MCC in August 1991, three months before
his death, Robert Maxwell learned fellow directors had met privately to
discuss their concerns about the level of inter-company debt between MCC
and the private Maxwell companies.
His son Mr Kevin Maxwell told a jury at the Old Bailey yesterday that
after his father's death, he had arranged for the group's assets to be
valued.
Mr Maxwell said, he often signed company documents a hundred at a time
in ''grand signing sessions'' to transfer assets.
Questioned by his counsel, Mr Alun Jones QC, Mr Maxwell said he was
aware of a share support scheme on which his father embarked after what
he believed was a bear raid on MCC shares by certain City institutions.
This involved using up to #150m of MCC's money to buy back its own
shares through offshore groups.
Mr Maxwell, 36, his brother Ian Maxwell, 39, and former Maxwell
financial adviser Larry Trachtenberg, 42, deny conspiracy to defraud the
Maxwell group pension funds by misusing shares.
The trial continues.

A woman who lied at a murder trial which later collapsed was jailed
for 30 months yesterday.
Teresa McGettigan, 24, was the main prosecution witness in the case
against her boyfriend, Mr John Egan, and co-accused Mr Brian Mowles, at
the High Court in Glasgow in August last year.
They were accused of murdering 29-year-old David McGaughey, who died
of gunshot and knife wounds at a council house in Barrhead,
Renfrewshire, in March 1994.
Both Mr Egan and Mr Mowles walked free after the Crown was forced to
abandon the case against them. They had denied killing Mr McGaughey who
was on the run following a shooting incident.
After the collapse of the case, McGettigan was prosecuted for perjury
and convicted of having lied on oath when she alleged that an innocent
third party had been at the murder scene armed with a gun.
Yesterday, McGettigan appeared for sentence at the High Court in
Edinburgh and her counsel, Mr Peter Gray, said she had been present at
the murder and was involved in the aftermath in cleaning up the scene of
the crime.
Temporary judge John Horsburgh told McGettigan: ''It is imperative a
clear message should go out from the courts to you and to anyone who may
be minded to act as you did that conduct of that sort cannot be
tolerated.''

In brief
THE Salmon Advisory Council, which advises the Government on all
aspects of salmon fishing and fisheries, is to be wound up at the end of
the current financial year because it has completed its work, announced
Fisheries Minister Tony Baldry in a Commons written reply.
PARLIAMENT will rise for its end-of-session prorogation on Wednesday,
November 8. It will return a week later, on Wednesday, November 15, for
the Queen's Speech which will launch the new session.
THE Prime Minister condemned reports on Government plans to tighten up
on immigration proceedures as ''entirely absurd'' and pledged that
Britain would continue to honour its United Nations obligations.
NORTHERN Ireland Minister of State Michael Ancram said the Government
had not watered down its stance on the decommissioning of arms in
Northern Ireland. But he said at Question Time that it was considering a
''twin-track'' approach involving an international body as
intermediaries to deal with decommissioning.
THE Prime Minister accused Shadow Cabinet members of ''double-think''
on education, claiming they wanted to abolish the good schools they
themselves had attended and to which they now sent their children. Mr
Major poured scorn over the Labour leadership's decision to send front
benchers on courses to Oxford's Templeton College.
ASDA came under fire in the Commons for its decision to scrap
double-time payments for Sunday working. Labour's Ray Powell, MP for
Ogmore, who campaigned fiercely against the relaxation of Sunday
shopping laws, told the House that the stores ''were reneging'' on a
promise.
THE Government's plans to strengthen mental health legislation,
following widespread concern over violent attacks by patients released
back into the community, cleared the Commons last night. The Mental
Health (Patients in the Community) Bill, which gained its third reading
without a vote, now returns to the Lords before going for Royal Assent
to become law.

HEALTH unions last night claimed that a hospital trust board had
shifted its position over a contract involving a private health-care
firm which could have resulted in 69 redundancies.
About half of the threatened workers at Canniesburn Hospital attended
a public meeting in Glasgow.
They were assured by Glasgow Royal Infirmary University NHS Trust that
the terms and conditions of catering, domestic, and portering staff
would not be affected but the trust failed to guarantee that the jobs
could be secured for the duration of a three-year contract awarded to
Initial Health Care. Initial beat a private rival and an in-house team.
Figures obtained by The Herald show that the difference between the
in-house bid and the Initial bid was #9312 -- the in-house price was
#722,016, compared to #712,704.
After last night's meeting, Unison official Jim Devine forecast that
Initial would be forced to walk away from the contract because it would
not be financially worthwhile to continue.
Mr Robert Parker, of the GMB union, said: ''The decision we have
secured from the trust tonight is that the same (working) conditions
will apply in terms of this contract to Initial Health Care Services.''
He had been anxious to avoid a bruising row such as had occurred at
the Royal 15 months ago over pay cuts being faced by workers when their
contract was being transferred from one contractor to another. On that
occasion, the workers won.
Mr Alan Bowie, the trust's director of operations, expressed surprise
at the unions' concerns.
''We have said quite clearly that the existing terms and conditions of
employment will carry through for the whole length of the contract.''
Asked what assurances he could give about threatened redundancies at
Canniesburn, Mr Bowie said: ''We accept quite openly that all the
current staff will transfer over.
''Any changes in the numbers of people employed will have to be
discussed between the unions and the incoming contractor. The trust will
want to have a watching brief on that to make sure that the staff are
treated fairly.''
The meeting heard that the trust, with 3400 staff and an annual budget
of #120m, had treated 3.3% more patients than in 1993-94 and there had
been a 12% reduction in waiting lists.
* Lomond Healthcare NHS Trust is to be invited to explain why it
intends to close the gynaecological ward at Vale of Leven Hospital at
Alexandria, Dunbartonshire.
Dumbarton and Clydebank unitary authority has decided to ask officials
to appear at its meeting next month. The trust says the ward is only 52%
efficient.
The plan is to mix female patients with others being admitted for
different types of operations. One consultant has expressed shock at the
prospect of patients having miscarriages being nursed in close proximity
to the maternity wing.

MICHAEL Heseltine was said last night to be ''feeling fine, sparkling
even'' after it emerged he is to be admitted to hospital for a kidney
stone operation.
The 62-year-old deputy prime minister, who suffered a heart attack in
June 1993, will undergo an operation at the London Clinic during the
week beginning November 13, the Cabinet Office said.
Party sources were playing down the significance of his condition,
insisting that he would stay in hospital only briefly.
But his operation means he is likely to miss the State Opening of
Parliament and the Queen's Speech on November 15.
A Cabinet Office spokesman said Mr Heseltine was expected to be away
from his office ''a few days'', but would return to full duties once he
had recuperated.
Mr Heseltine suffered a heart attack in Venice in June 1993.
On Tuesday Mr Heseltine presented the British Fashion Awards in
London, after he had stood in for the Prime Minister at Question Time.
In the Commons, he had appeared to Tory back benchers to be off form,
and many remarked afterwards that his hands were trembling during
exchanges.
Mr Heseltine last night told journalists to ''calm down'' about his
condition. ''It is a very routine thing,'' he told Sky News.
Asked if the operation would take him out of action for a while, Mr
Heseltine replied: ''No, no. Just a couple of days. So calm down.''
Mr Heseltine delivered a speech at the Dorchester Hotel last night to
the Hong Kong Development Council.

<HEADLINE>Blair agrees to take 2.7% pay rise for next year</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>9</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>975683908</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
TONY Blair, who this year declined an inflation-busting pay rise as
Opposition leader, has decided to take an increase for 1996, it emerged
last night.
The 2.7% increase is in line with salary rises for Ministers agreed
without a vote by the Commons last night. It will take Mr Blair's total
pay from #62,480 this year to #64,167 from January 1 next year. The
figures arise from his Opposition leader's salary (#37,495 in 1995,
rising to #38,507 in 1996) and a reduced parliamentary salary (#24,985
in 1995, rising to #25,660 in 1996).
A spokeswoman in Mr Blair's office explained: ''Mr Blair did not take
the 4.7% rise last year because it was in excess of inflation. This year
it is not excess of inflation.''
But the Labour leader came under fire in the Commons from Tory
ex-Minister Sir Terence Higgins (Worthing), who apparently believed Mr
Blair again had decided not to take an increase.
Sir Terence warned that the House and the Government faced a
recruitment ''crisis'' because parliamentary and ministerial salaries
had fallen behind in real terms in the past 30 years.
Calling for a doubling of pay for MPs and a trebling of ministers'
salaries, he said: ''I was very sorry that the Leader of the Opposition
apparently hasn't decided to take the pay increase which he would get.''
Sir Terence added: ''This is similar to the worst excesses of
Thatcherism, when the previous Prime Minister refused to take her full
salary. I believe that was a serious mistake. And I am sorry the Leader
of the Opposition seems to be following in Mrs Thatcher's footsteps in
this respect.''
The Order, approved by the Commons, will increase the salaries of most
Ministers, the Opposition leader and some Opposition whips in line with
an increase already awarded to MPs, which in turn was linked with pay
rises awarded to middle-ranking civil servants.
It will take the Prime Minister's total salary, including the reduced
parliamentary salary which he receives in common with all other
ministers, from #82,003 to #84,217.
Cabinet Ministers will receive #69,651, up from their present total of
#67,819.
Introducing the Order, Commons Leader Tony Newton said: ''The policy
of a clear automatic linkage for MPs, which is then straightforwardly
carried through by Order to Ministers and others, has provided us with a
mechanism which means that for the last two years we have been able to
settle these matters without substantial controversy.''
For the Opposition, Jeff Rooker told the House: ''It is right that
salary arrangements for Ministers should be dealt with on exactly the
same basis as for other MPs.''
Later, Mr Newton agreed with those members who protested annual
Commons debates about salaries of MPs and Ministers tended to court
unnecessary controversy.
He said: ''I have no doubt whatever about the value of a system
whereby Members' pay can be increased sensibly and fairly, annually, but
without the need for an annual debate.
''I have every intention of making sure that such a system is
sustained.''
Earlier, Liberal Democrat Archy Kirkwood (Roxburgh and Berwickshire)
said there should be a pay review body or Nolan-type inquiry into the
calculation of MPs' pay, to prepare recommendations for the next
Government.
Tory Sir Peter Emery (Honiton) said: ''It can't be right that the
chairman of UK Limited, our Prime Minister, is paid less than the chief
executive officer of all the top 100 companies. ''
Labour's Dennis Skinner (Bolsover) told Sir Peter: ''You're one of
those Tories that will gladly support a minimum wage for MPs and
Ministers, but when it comes to ordinary workers on #1 or #2 an hour,
you'll walk into the division lobby to stop them getting a miserly #4 an
hour.''

A SCOTS midwife has flown to Rwanda to attend her late husband's
funeral, 18 months after he was presumed murdered in the genocide in the
African state.
Mrs Lesley Bilinda, from Edinburgh, has flown to Rwanda to give her
husband Charles a proper funeral. His body was believed to be among
thousands buried in a mass grave near Butare.
The couple first met when Mrs Bilinda went to Rwanda in 1989 to run a
community health project in the village of Gahini on behalf of Tear
Fund. While there, she met Charles, a Rwandan pastor who was teaching in
Gahini, and married him in January 1993.
When the genocide began, Mrs Bilinda was on holiday in Kenya but
Charles remained in Rwanda. She did not seehim again.
It was six months until she was able to return to Rwanda, where the
rumours of Charles' death were confirmed.
Hundreds of thousands of Rwandans who were murdered were never
identified, their bodies left to rot or dumped in mass graves.
Mrs Bilinda said they were now being given the dignity of proper
funeral services, area by area, throughout the country.
She said: ''I have gone back to Rwanda to attend a special service in
Butare for Charles and all those who died.
''It is important for me to be there although I know it will be very
painful.''
Mrs Bilinda said she has set up a charitable trust in Charles's memory
-- the Charles Bilinda Memorial Trust -- which provides education
opportunities and support for Rwandan students, working for the long-
term future of Rwanda.

GLASGOW will gain 140 fewer jobs than promised when the Army's new
integrated pay and personnel centre opens in the city in mid-1997
because advances in information technology have cut the need for staff.
According to a Defence Ministry consultation document being circulated
among senior civil servants, the centre eventually will employ 100
military and about 1000 civilian workers, representing a 20% cutback on
original estimates.
But an undisclosed number of staff may be taken on under temporary,
fixed-term contracts until the full range of new technology becomes
available and is installed in the city's Kentigern House.
Defence unions yesterday gave the document a guarded welcome, claiming
that they had expected some loss of numbers after Treasury-led cost
studies.
Mr Gerry Burns, Scottish regional secretary of the Civil and Public
Servants Association, said last night: ''The confirmation that the
office is to be set up in Glasgow, after all the rumours to the
contrary, is a great relief. There will still be a substantial number of
new jobs, and the safeguarding of existing posts.
''Once Glasgow is established, there are also possibilities that the
centre might be expanded to take in pay and records for the Royal Navy
and the RAF, although that would be a long way down the road. But the
tri-service function is on the cards, and that would probably be good
news for Glasgow.''

A SACKED senior Edinburgh council official involved in the

Edinburgh District Council confirmed that an out-of-court settlement
has been reached with its former deputy director of housing, Mr Bruce
Lumsden.
Mr Lumsden was in charge of administering grant applications.
The scheme captured the imagination of the public throughout Scotland
in the early 1980s, with tens of thousands of flat-owners, the majority
from Glasgow and Edinburgh, clamouring to get the massive grants to help
pay for major repairs.
A council source said the backlog in Edinburgh was due to inadequacies
in the system set up to deal with the grants and the high number of
applications they received.
A council spokesman said last night: ''The claim to the industrial
tribunal made by Mr Bruce Lumsden, former deputy director of housing, in
respect of his dismissal from the council has been resolved.
''It has been resolved without any admission of liability by the
district council on an economic basis and within the parameters of
statutory notice entitlement.''
From 1984 to 1991, Glasgow District Council dealt with an estimated
12,500 applications.
Edinburgh District Council still has 105 grant applications on its
books to deal with. Of that figure, 60 projects are about to go on site,
37 others are proposed to be offered by next March, and eight people
have cancelled their applications.
Figures show that, since 1984, there has been #184m of public money
spent on about 22,500 flats in the capital.
Meanwhile, the Herald has learned of new developments regarding
Borders architect Dennis Rodwell, from Melrose, who has been suspended
by his professional body over complaints about his handling of the
grants scheme.
New private papers obtained by The Herald show that intensive
inquiries by the council found Mr Rodwell to be completely clear of any
blame involving repair grants administered at houses in Brunswick Road
and Morrison Street.
The new row over Mr Rodwell and the outstanding housing grants repair
backlog is still causing controversy within the corridors in power.
Last November, housing officials in Edinburgh admitted a #9m
miscalculation in the amount of funding to deal with the backlog of
improvement grants.
One council source said: ''It is a source of constant embarrassment
for the council to still be dealing with the housing backlog. The
Rodwell situation is also embarrassing for them, because there are many
people who believe he has been unfairly treated.
''They see their own investigation clearing him, yet he has still been
suspended by his professional body. It seems he has been made a type of
scapegoat for what has happened.''
Pressure is growing on the Royal Incorporation of Architect to
re-consider its suspension of Mr Rodwell, who had been found guilty of
professional misconduct, an accusation which he denied.
Last night, a senior architect said: ''Many members of the profession
are getting more and more angry at the way he has been treated. As more
and more council papers like the ones you have mentioned become public,
it becomes clear he was hard done by.''
Edinburgh Architectural Association has already given him support.
The council see its own investigation clearing Mr Rodwell, yet he has
still been suspended by his professional body. It seems he has been made
a type of scapegoat for what has happened

SMARTCARDS were designed and developed by Motorola and the computer
company Bull in 1977 for a French banking association, Cartes Bancaires,
which was looking for a way to combat the rising cost of card fraud to
its members, writes Keith Sinclair.
Using relatively unsophisticated equipment, the memory contents of a
stolen conventional ''magnetic stripe'' card can be read and copied into
counterfeit cards, which can then be used to pay for goods and services.
Today most smartcards are being used in banking, mainly in France; in
digital mobile telephone systems where the smartcard has helped to
reduce fraud; and in access-control systems for Pay Television.
Figures released by Cartes Bancaires show that French banks have
reduced the level of fraud from 0.3% of total annual transaction values
to 0.04% since the widespread introduction of the cards.
They are usually the same size as a conventional credit card. The most
obvious difference in a smartcard's appearance is a small gold-coloured
metal ''button'' or module on one side of the device.
This contains a silicon chip called a smartcard microcontroller which
is powered by electrical contacts when the card is inserted into a
reader.
The microcontroller, and software stored in it, provides the first of
many barriers against fraud as well as other benefits to users.
Like the magnetic stripe, the microcontroller stores information. But,
because it has the capability to encrypt this data and store it in areas
that are designated to be unreadable, it helps prevent the unauthorised
reading and subsequent cloning which plagues some magnetic stripe card
systems.
The smartcard microcontroller's ability to store and change data
allows it to store user details in its memory and update these each time
a service is sued or a transaction performed.
This means that it can be used in a wide variety of applications --
such as a credit card, driving licence, security card, or passport --
which provide the key to the industry's growth.
Governments and authorities throughout the world are investigating the
use of them in such fields as social security and health.
The Spanish government, for example, is planning to issue about 35
million smartcards to people who claim social security, while the Czech
Republic and Taiwanese governments are planning to implement smartcards
for their health services.
Smartcards are also being considered for uses such as road tolls, bus
tickets, and Internet access cards, although one of the most interesting
developments is in cards which perform more than one function.
A number of American universities now issue multi-purpose ''campus
cards'' where students have their library ticket, car park details, and
an electronic purse on one card.
Motorola, which was estimated to have a 70% share in the smartcard
microcontroller market last year (1994), predicts that developments in
the manufacturing process will mean that the microcontroller chip will
continue to get smaller, cheaper, and more versatile and will offer a
wider range of features.
Manufacturers are also seeking increasingly high levels of security to
ensure they remain ahead of potential fraudsters at a time when the
worldwide value of transactions handled by the cards is set to increase
rapidly.
Motorola engineers at the company's newly established research and
development facility at East Kilbride have developed a process which
allows for the test circuitry built on to the smartcard microchips to be
physically removed, after quality testing, through an innovative
precision sawing technique.
This is designed to foil any future attempts to use the test circuits
as a possible ''back door'' route into the microchip's contents once in
use.
Mr Waqar Qureshi, worldwide marketing manager for smartcards at
Motorola, described the technique as being ''like destroying all trace
of the bridge once you have crossed the river''.
He added: ''Our goal is to make it as difficult as practically
possible for anyone to hack into the microchip's memory contents.
Smartcards are already more secure than normal magnetic-stripe cards and
this new technique will help improve that security even further.''
The technology is being introduced at the company's smartcard
production lines in East Kilbride and South Queensferry and will first
appear in a brand of smartcard microchips to be launched early next
year.

MOTOROLA, the American-based electronics giant which employs more than
3000 people in chip manufacturing in Scotland, is to expand by 10 times
its worldwide capacity to produce computer chips for smartcards -- bank
cards with built-in protection against fraud.
The company, which is the world's leading supplier of microchips for
the credit card-sized devices, has confirmed that its semi-conductor
plants at East Kilbride and South Queensferry will form a key part of
its bid to meet a predicted massive expansion in demand for the cards
throughout the world.
Motorola said yesterday that production of the smartcard microchips
will start soon at its South Queensferry plant, which was bought from
Digital Equipment Corporation six months ago when the buyer announced it
would invest #63.3m there and create 100 jobs over the next three years.
The company, which forecasts the worldwide market for the
''microcontroller'' chips at the heart of the smartcards will grow from
about #60m today to #630m in the next five years, is also to continue
expanding production capacity at its two chip plants at East Kilbride to
handle a new manufacturing process.
Speaking at a trade exhibition in Paris yesterday, Mr Allan Hughes,
Motorola's worldwide smartcard operations manager, said: ''Parts of our
#250m investment at East Kilbride, which we announced last year and
included an expansion in our manufacturing capacity for smartcards, will
enable us to respond to the explosive demand of the smartcard market.''
The investment at East Kilbride included the expansion of a wafer
fabrication building to handle a new manufacturing process which shrinks
the size of a smartcard microchip by half. This means that twice the
number of microchips can be obtained from a single wafer of silicon,
doubling the potential output.
Motorola also confirmed at the Cartes '95 exhibition that East
Kilbride had been designated as the company's world headquarters for the
manufacturing smartcards -- the first time it has established the
headquarters of a business unit outside the US.
The latest developments are confirmation of a commitment made by
Motorola last year to make Scotland a ''world centre of excellence'' for
smartcards.
Mr Hughes said the company would have the capacity to produce 10
million smartcard microchips per week by the year 2000.
He continued: ''Smartcards have finally come of age. After 18 years of
slow but steady growth, the market is set to take off with a number of
major applications throughout the world in fields such as health care,
financial services, and telecommunications.
''Visa's recent decision to use Motorola microchips in smartcards for
the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta is an example of the huge potential
for the smartcard market.''
He added: ''The only major obstacle to growth at present is lack of
microchip production capacity, hence our major investment to increase
capacity tenfold by the end of the decade.''
Mr Tony Joyce, director of external affairs, said of Motorola's market
forecast: ''This confirms that the #158.3m expansion at East Kilbride,
which we said we needed to be able to meet demand, is being fully
justified because these sorts of figures show that the electronics
explosion we keep telling people about is still happening.
''The demand is still being generated out there so we feel confident
that this expansion a year ago is the best thing that we did.''
Mr Joyce added that Scotland had been a very successful location for
Motorola during the past 25 years and praised the quality of its
workforce which had helped it to meet the demands of its customers.
Motorola, which employs 2400 at East Kilbride and 500 in South
Queensferry, is investing #1575m worldwide in semiconductor
manufacturing facilities, of which a ''significant proportion'' is being
dedicated to smartcard production.
Smartcard plant investment is also being made in the United States and
Motorola expects to support the fast-growing Asia-Pacific market with
local smartcard microchip production capacity before the end of the
decade.

A MAN accused of strangling his drinking partner and wheeling him away
in a supermarket trolley to burn the body was freed yesterday.
The not-proven verdict for 45-year-old Ted Conroy leaves a question
mark over the death of Edinburgh father-of-three Eric Muldownie, 52.
Mr Conroy, of Pilrig Street, Edinburgh, had denied murdering Mr
Muldownie on June 27 in the flat occupied by Mrs Rosemary Thomson, his
girlfriend's sister, at Fort House, Leith.
In a special defence, he claimed the murder was committed by
45-year-old Mrs Thomson.
When he gave evidence, Mr Conroy told the jury of eight women and
seven men that he was nowhere near the flat when Mr Muldownie was
killed.
He claimed that when he arrived at the flat, Mrs Thomson confessed to
murdering Mr Muldownie.
Mr Conroy told Mr Neil Murray QC, defending, that he saw the man's
body wrapped up in linen in a boxroom.
He alleged that Mrs Thomson threatened him that if he didn't help her
to get rid of it she would tell the police that he and her sister, Mrs
May Smith, his 41-year-old girlfriend, were the killers.
When Mrs Thomson gave evidence, she admitted that she had initially
been charged with Mr Conroy with murdering Mr Muldownie.
Five weeks ago, she received a letter from the procurator-fiscal
telling her there would be no further proceedings and she was released
from jail.

THEY are like the best of friends. As East Kilbride grew up from a
village near Glasgow to a mature new town, Motorola grew up beside it.
It was the success of capturing Motorola back in 1969 which showed
that East Kilbride was a main player in providing a home for the
emerging electronics industry. And it was the success of East Kilbride
supplying Motorola with young, talented staff, and the access to
government finance, which allowed the American corporation to make the
town its main European manufacturing centre.
Like all good friends there were even the occasional arguments. Labour
councillors in the town supported trade union attempts to unionise the
factory -- but the company always resisted.
Motorola originally chose East Kilbride for the manufacture of silicon
chips for the fledling computer industry, employing about 100 people.
As technology became more sophisticated, so did the output from East
Kilbride, which moved into the production of quarter-inch memory chips
and microprocessors.
Gradually the factory grew, and so did the workforce. By 1978 it was
up to 650. By the mid-eighties the workforce had grown again to 1800.
It is now up to 2400 as its 32-bit microprocessors are used in
increasing numbers of applications. Soon there will hardly be a house or
office which does not have a Motorola microchip somewhere embedded in an
electrical gadget.
As demand grew it was not just East Kilbride that benefitted. Instead
of simply making the microprocessors for mobile phones, Motorola would
make the phones also -- and again Scotland came out tops after a trawl
of Europe -- with a site near Bathgate being chosen in 1990 for a #100m
manufacturing plant.
Even then there was no slowing down in Motorola's love affair with
Scotland. This summer it swooped on Digital's South Queensferry
microchip factory.
But its first love, East Kilbride, was not forgotten. A further #250m
worth of investment was announced this year, guaranteeing, as far as is
possible in the quick-changing world of electronics, that Motorola will
remain Scotland's largest manufacturing employer well into the next
decade.

<HEADLINE>MPs in urgent meeting with Defence Ministry as more foreign pilots use Scotland as training ground. Jump in low-flying jet complaints</HEADLINE>

SCOTTISH MPs have been granted an urgent meeting with the Ministry of
Defence to protest at new figures which show that the number of
complaints about low-flying jets in Scotland has risen by 46% in the
past year.
The all-party low flying group will ask Defence Minister Earl Howe to
explain why an increasing number of foreign air forces are being allowed
to train their pilots in low-flying over Scotland without extending
similar privileges to the RAF.
Research prepared for Labour MP George Foulkes by a defence
consultant, and passed to The Herald, has charted a 46% increase in
complaints over nine months. From January to September last year, 802
complaints were registered in Scotland; this year in the same period the
number has risen to 1172.
The research also claims that the Government has changed its
long-standing policy of allowing foreign jets to undertake low-flying
exercises in the UK only on a strict squadron-to-squadron exchange
basis.
Mr Malcolm Spaven, an Edinburgh-based defence consultant, claimed
yesterday the RAF now allows Italian and Danish air forces to carry out
regular low-altitude flights over Scotland. ''The RAF have started to
breach the policy. These flights are not part of any Nato squadron
exchange.''
He said Italy had resisted allowing British jets to carry out
low-altitude exercises in its airspace, and that Denmark had refused to
allow RAF jets to fly below 1000ft, even though Danish jets are allowed
to fly at 250ft in parts of Scotland.
Mr Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock, and Doon Valley and chair
of the low-flying group, said: ''Our pilots are no longer allowed to do
low-flying in Germany, and now it appears that we are taking other
countries' low-flying.
''We accept that low flying is necessary for the training of pilots.
However I think there's too much being done overall, because more of it
could be done in simulators. We are having more than our fair share of
it, not only within the UK but within Europe.''
Yesterday, the RAF admitted there had been a ''marginal'' increase in
the number of low-altitude training flights as a result of a 1990 German
ban on flights below 1000ft. RAF Tornado and Harrier squadrons based in
Germany have to fly to the UK to train.
Mr Chris Shepherd, a spokesman for RAF Strike Command at High Wycombe,
Buckinghamshire, said: ''Based on the 1988 figures, there has been a 30%
reduction of jet low-flying over the whole of the UK generally. All
areas, including Scotland, will have benefited from this reduction.''
He agreed that ''there are more RAF flights over the UK as a result of
the German ban''.
But on the question of foreign flights, he would only say: ''Foreign
air forces are subject to the same rules as the RAF. There are a number
of exercises which take place every year which are widely publicised
which involve low flying and some of which involve foreign aircraft.''
Mr Richard Cliff, the RAF's community liaison officer in the South of
Scotland, said: ''In my patch, yes, complaints have gone up a bit, but
it's flexible.''
He blamed the increase on the reduction of the exclusion zone around
Prestwick Airport, which resulted in low flying in areas where people
were unused to it, and on the good summer, which resulted in fewer RAF
flights being cancelled by bad weather.

RANGERS Football Club vice-chairman and leading Scottish advocate
Donald Findlay yesterday called for the Crown Office to consider making
public its guidelines on offences involving footballers, so that the
public can be reassured that the law is being applied evenly throughout
the country.
The advocate, who had been speaking in response to a question raised
at the club's annual meeting, explained afterwards that he did not
believe there was one law for the public and one for Rangers, simply
that he understood why people may believe it, because of the different
attitudes by procurators fiscal in different parts of the country.
One fan had asked him if he felt there was a ''Scottish establishment
vendetta'' against Rangers. Mr Findlay took this as a reference to the
recent jailing of former player Duncan Ferguson following an on-field
head-butt while playing for the Ibrox club.
He said he could understand why people felt there was one set of rules
for Rangers players and another for the public. He instanced the
violence amongst players at the Scottish Junior Cup final and the
incident when two Hearts players attacked each other, one ending up with
a broken nose, yet of all three incidents only Mr Ferguson was taken to
court.
''It's easy to get paranoid about the thing,'' he told the
shareholders, but, putting some stiffening into their backbone, he told
them: ''We are Rangers. No-one likes us. And we don't care.''
More than 800 Rangers shareholders attended yesterday's meeting in
Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall -- making it probably the best attended
shareholders' meeting in Scotland this year.

ONE of An Comunn Gaidhealach's ''old guard'', vice-president Neil
Brownlie, resigned yesterday in circumstances more usually associated
with the Kremlin.
The resignation of Mr Brownlie, 74, a poet and writer, comes six
months after consultants said the management committee on which he
served was ''archaic, inefficient, and cumbersome''. Some people
interviewed by the consultants said the committee, the ard-chomhairle,
generally looked like Politburo members at a May Day celebration.
Mr Brownlie held the number two spot with the Mod organisers since a
coup earlier this year ousted former president Donald Macritchie and
vice-president Duncan Ferguson. Mr Brownlie and president Mrs Ann Draper
then took the reins.
His decision follows revelations last week that he had boycotted the
Royal National Mod in Golspie last week and had gone home after a
dispute on the opening day.
Speaking from his home in Larbert, Stirlingshire, he said: ''I have
told the president of my decision and there is nothing more I wish to
say just now, except that I am still a member, as I have been since
1960.''
A statement from An Comunn Gaidhealach confirmed Mrs Draper had
received the letter tendering the vice-president's resignation. It went
on: ''Mr Brownlie also intimated he was to stand down as chairman of the
southern region of An Comunn on October 28 and also as its
representative on the management committee, the ard-chomhairle.''
Southern region is the largest in An Comunn's network.
An insider at An Comunn said yesterday there had been conflict between
Mr Brownlie and his management committee colleagues since last April.
''After initially moving for endorsement of the proposed business plan
drawn up by consultants, he just seemed to turn against it,'' said the
insider, who did not wish to be named.
''It is undoubtedly also fair to say he was not so comfortable in the
supporting role expected of the vice-president.''
The business plan, now being implemented by An Comunn, stunned the
leadership initially by branding the ard-chomhairle as ''archaic,
inefficient, and cumbersome''.
It went on to recommend some far-reaching changes. These included
slashing the number of members of the ard-chomhairle, the appointment of
a Mod promotion officer, expanding the membership and involving it more,
and establishing links and office-sharing with development body Comunn
na Gaidhlig (CNAG).
Yesterday, Mrs Draper would say only that she had accepted Mr
Brownlie's resignation with regret and thanked him for his support in
the past.

KWIK-FIT'S own insurance brokers would not have taken a shareholding
in its new motor insurance company if it had known the financial
background of the managing director, a court heard yesterday.
Alexander and Alexander, one of the largest brokers in the world, took
a 12.5% share in Kwik-Fit Insurance Services and sent its national
services director, Mr Lawrence Law, to complete final details in January
this year.
Mr Law said he was approached by two managers who voiced concerns
about the managing director, Mr Raymond Connor, and rumours about
Glasgow brokers, Campbell Renfield, of which he was a director.
Mr Law instructed his London office to make a company search which
revealed Campbell Renfield had gone into liquidation on November 29.
Mr Law said his firm's standing gave the whole project acceptability
for other insurance firms and had it known of Mr Connor's involvement
with Campbell Renfield, it was unlikely that it would have taken a
stake.
Mr Connor, of St Swithin's Cottage, Ninemileburn, Midlothian, is
seeking damages of #50,000 from Kwik-Fit for alleged breach of contract
in dismissing him and a ruling obliging the firm to pay cash in terms of
a share agreement.
Kwik-Fit has raised an action against Mr Connor for the partial
reduction in share transactions made in his favour.
The hearing, before Lord Coulsfield, continues.

THREE doctors are facing disciplinary action for detailing how
patients suffering from an eating disorder indulged in blood-letting.
The behaviour of the patients, who all had a medical background, was
highlighted in a pyschiatric journal.
But one of them now claims she never agreed to be featured in the
magazine and the doctors are to go before a disciplinary hearing on
Monday.
Dr John Eagles and Dr Alistair Palin, both of the Royal Cornhill
Hospital, Aberdeen, and their former colleague, Dr Jon Richard Parkin,
are charged with serious professional misconduct.
They based their article on three female patients who all suffered
from bulimia nervosa.
The psychiatrists used their details for an article in the British
Journal of Psychiatry, published in February 1993.
It describes how the three thought they would lose weight by draining
their blood, sometimes a litre at a time.
The women were referred to in the paper only as Misses A, B and C. But
it is understood one of them asserts the information given was enough
for her to be recognised.

A COUNCIL chief has been criticised for hiring a group of workers on
an employment training scheme to landscape his garden.
Mr Tom McBain, who becomes a #56,000 director with the new Highland
Council next April, paid well below the going rate to have his back
garden turfed and paved by volunteers on a council-run scheme.
Mr McBain, who is Highland region's assistant director of
architectural services, said yesterday he was told by the then manager
of the council's Job Enterprise Training scheme that he could use the
workers for the job ''because they had nothing else to do''.
He added: ''I needed my back garden turfed to make a mini football
pitch for my sons and the trainees needed something to do. I do not see
anything wrong with that.''
Mr McBain, who will become the new council's director of architectural
services (estates), said: ''I am not the first person in the council to
make the most of the scheme by any stretch of the imagination.''
He has since sold his house in Drumsmittal Road, North Kessock, near
Inverness. He said he had paid for materials and labour, although he
admitted the cost was ''considerably less'' than it would have been if
he had used professional landscapers.
Mr Simon Barraclough, who runs an Inverness landscaping firm, Natural
Habitat, said: ''This is a disgrace. How are we supposed to compete with
prices that can be offered by the people running this scheme using
so-called trainees who are getting paid next to nothing.''
He added: ''We are experts in our field and there are already enough
cowboys trying their hands at landscaping without Government-run
projects having a go as well. This type of thing puts people's real jobs
at risk.''
A council spokesman said it was not always possible to place trainees
with private firms. The council was willing to listen to approaches from
members of the public who needed jobs done.
Liberal Democrat MP Charles Kennedy said yesterday he would raise the
matter with the council.

ELEVEN-year-old Jaymee Bowen -- who underwent treatment paid for by a
private donor after Cambridge and Huntingdon Health Commission refused
her a new treatment on the NHS -- was back in hospital yesterday.
The High Court in London decided on Wednesday that Jaymee could be
identified so that her father could raise money for her further
treatment.
Jaymee, from Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, was admitted to Portland
Hospital for adjustment to anti-rejection drugs and will remain in
hospital until the weekend.
The treatment which she was refused on the NHS is intended to help
leukemia patients who have had a relapse after a bone-marrow transplant.
It involves infusions of donated white lymphocyte blood cells to boost
the immune system.
Jaymee was given lymphocytes from her nine-year-old sister Charlotte
but needs other drugs to stop her rejecting them.
At the time she was refused the treatment it had been tried on adults
but never on children.
Yesterday, the Royal Marsden Hospital, London, where doctors had
earlier said the treatment was not appropriate for Jaymee, confirmed
that trials had just started with children.
A few months ago, the hospital, which carries out pioneering research
into cancer, conducted lymphocyte infusions on six adults. Four of them
remained alive.

TWO teenagers have contracted the human equivalent of mad cow disease,
a condition which is almost unknown in people under 30.
The development has led scientists to speculate about the possibility
of a new and hitherto unknown risk factor for Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.
The 18-year-old youth, who is known to have died, and a 16-year-old
girl are the youngest reported victims of the incurable brain disease in
the UK.
Only four cases of CJD in teenagers are known to have occurred before,
in the US, France, Canada, and Poland.
Neither of the British teenagers had any of the recognised risk
factors associated with CJD, such as treatment with hormones from the
pituitary glands of dead bodies.
The boy had regularly visited his aunt's farm, where cows are kept,
but no cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy -- mad cow disease --
have been reported in the herd. Although the girl had eaten cow's brain
in Cyprus, no cases of BSE have been reported there.
The cases were reported in the latest issue of the medical journal,
the Lancet. The report did not make clear whether he girl had died.

POLICE yesterday admitted mishandling and bungling their investigation
of a mother who killed one of her daughters and poisoned another.
Detective Superintendent Peter Coles, of Nottinghamshire Constabulary,
said after the trial of Celia Beckett: ''Things today are not done as
they were. In court, the word used for the police investigation was
'sloppy'. I don't totally disagree, although I would prefer 'naive'.''
Beckett, 34, was convicted of poisoning and killing her four-year-old
daughter Tracey and poisoning her two-year-old daughter Debbie, who
survived the attack.
Beckett, of Fenton Close, Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, has
already admitted causing cruelty to Debbie.
The case came to light only after Tracey's body was exhumed in January
1994, along with that of her sister Clare, who died aged seven after
suffering a brain injury as a child. A charge against Beckett of
grievous bodily harm for this injury was dropped.
A new post-mortem examination held on Tracey showed she died from a
massive overdose of her mother's anti-depressant tablets.
Her sister Debbie was poisoned inthe same way.
Beckett was sent to a bail hostel while psychiatric reports are drawn
up.

A BELFAST girl has spoken of her terror after a pistol barrel was
pushed in her mouth by a Republican ''punishment gang'' who dragged her
from her home, tied her to a lamppost, cut off her hair, and plastered
her with paint.
Local SDLP councillor Hugh Lewsley condemned the attack, saying it was
a serious breach of the ceasefire. Sinn Fein had no comment.
Denise Clarkin, 16, said when she answered a knock at the door of her
Twinbrook home on the Catholic side of Belfast on Wednesday night, ''a
gang pushed in past me wearing Celtic scarves over their faces.
''I stood across the living room door and one of them stuck a gun in
my mouth and shouted, 'Get away from the door or I'll blow your brains
out'. They grabbed me and dragged me down the street.
''They tied me to a lamppost and cut my hair. By that time, my parents
and some of the neighbours were running down the street and one of the
men shouted, 'Quick, pour the paint over her'.''
The family believe they were targeted as part of an IRA vendetta
against another daughter, Lucy, who lives elsewhere.
Detectives last night were questioning a man in connection with the
attack.
* More than 400 terrorist prisoners are to be freed early over the
next four years after the Government yesterday announced changes to the
rules on remission.
A Bill to allow inmates serving fixed terms of more than five years in
Ulster for scheduled terrorist offences to be released after serving
half their sentences is to be rushed through Parliament.

A MAN died and families had to be evacuated by boat as torrential rain
swept Scotland yesterday, bringing treacherous conditions to the roads
as the country headed for the wettest October since records began.
In Glasgow, the deluge brought the city's rainfall for the month to
nine inches.
The man who died was pensioner William Russell, of Drumry Road East,
Bowling, who was a passenger in the car being driven by his son, also
William, 42. The car burst into flames on the Glasgow-Dumbarton road
near Bowling and Mr Russell Jr, had to be pulled from the wreckage. Last
night, he was comfortable in Vale of Leven Hospital.
Firemen and coastguards used boats to evacuate some families from
their homes in Kilmarnock and several families were stranded in their
homes in Stevenston.
Assistant Firemaster of Strathclyde Fire Brigade, David Kennedy, said
25 people were evacuated from commercial premises in Kilmarnock's
Glencairn Square about 4.30pm and the Safeway supermarket in West Shaw
Street was closed as a precaution. A further 25 people were evacuated
from their homes in the town.
An emergency planning team from Cunninghame District Council was put
on full alert at 9.30pm in Irvine's Waterside area, which was badly
affected by flooding last December.
A police spokesman in Irvine said roads department officials
distributed sandbags in the area and pumped water from the roads.
In Pollokshaws, Glasgow, families who returned to their homes only a
few months ago after being flooded out last year were again under
threat.
Traffic jams built up and, at one stage yesterday, there was a 10-mile
queue stretching from Glasgow Airport to the Kingston Bridge.
The 2am high tide brought no further immediate flooding threats as the
downpours abated but the flood threat remained.
As water from sodden hillsides seeped into streams a spokesman at
Glasgow Weather Centre said: ''There is still a possibility of more
flooding.''

THE campaign to save the Fort William sleeper must be the last
campaign fought in defence of Highland rail services, Ross, Cromarty and
Skye MP Charles Kennedy said yesterday -- before he went on to lay the
foundations of a new positive campaign.
This broad-based, all-party campaign should go to Downing Street,
Europe, and the Objective One Programme, promoting the development of
Highland rail services, Mr Kennedy told a conference in Inverness on the
future of the Far North line.
''We should set ourselves a target of say next summer for being in a
position to produce a blueprint for an integrated transport system for
the Highlands and Islands.
''This should include presentations to John Major (and I still have an
uncashed cheque from him for a meeting on Highland railways) and to the
European Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock, who should be invited to
come to the Highlands to see for himself.
''We should seek all party-endorsement, which we should be able to get
before the next election, and it should form a major plank of
legislation for the next Westminster Parliament or a Scottish
Parliament.''
Mr Kennedy said that, under the present arrangements, there was a
seven-year guarantee for existing Highland rail services and at very
least, when that ran out, every one of these services should be free
from any threat of withdrawal.
''Rather than fighting to save the likes of the Fort William sleeper,
we should be seeking to win the establishment of regular services direct
from the likes of Fort William and Inverness right into the heart of
Europe.''
As a first step towards this new campaign, Mr Kennedy suggested that a
steering committee should be set up including representatives from the
railway companies, the local authorities, and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise, a call endorsed by ScotRail director John Ellis. Dr Ken
MacTaggart, network strategy director for HIE, said his organisation
would be happy to organise the first meeting.
Mr Ellis told the conference that a new commuter service from Tain to
Inverness should be in place for next summer's timetable.
He said this was evidence of ScotRail's commitment to the Far North
line between Inverness and Wick/Thurso. He was further committed to
trying to reduce the travel time on that journey by about 45 minutes to
about three hours. This would not, however, be achieved by building a
#25m rail crossing on the Dornoch Firth.
He expressed interest in a call by Labour's transport spokesman, Mr
Brian Wilson, for the establishment of a Passenger Transport Authority
for the Highlands and Islands. Mr Wilson had been due to speak at the
conference but had been delayed because of parliamentary commitments.
His speech, however, was read out in his absence: ''It is Labour's
clear intention to expand the system of Passenger Transport Authorities,
which have worked so well in the metropolitan areas areas of Britain for
more than 25 years. The idea of a mainly rural PTA would be innovative
and challenging.''
He invited everyone to consider it because they would be ''pushing at
an open door'' under a Labour government.
Dr Paul Prescott, director of Railtrack Scotland, said that the
company was keen to see the Far North service improved, and thought that
#25,000 could be well spent on commissioning a study into how this could
be achieved. Dr MacTaggart said that the HIE would be willing to
part-fund such a study.
But the convener of Highland Regional Council, Mr Duncan McPherson,
warned against the idea of mini-franchising for the line.

Luxembourg
SCOTLAND'S fishermen emerged favourably from a deal struck yesterday
by European Union Ministers which will allow limited access by the big
Spanish fishing fleet to waters off western Britain and Ireland.
Mr Michael Forsyth, making his first visit to the Council of Ministers
since being appointed Scottish Secretary, hailed the deal which should
have minimal effects on the Scottish fleet but will impose special
controls on the Spanish.
''The deal agreed today, which came originally from proposals by the
Scottish industry itself, can be seen as a victory for common sense over
bureaucracy,'' he said.
Mr Bob Allan of the Scottish Fishermen's Association, representing
1000 boats, said: ''This agreement on control measures is very much as
we advocated.''
British and Spanish ministers joined in rejecting an elaborate
European Commission control plan which Fisheries Minister Tony Baldry
denounced as ''amazingly over-bureaucratic and costly''.
With British encouragement the Spanish -- current holders of the EU's
presidency -- set about gaining support from other fishing nations,
including the Irish, for a compromise plan. In the end, the commission's
proposal was sunk by a unanimous vote.
Mr Baldry immediately commended the deal to backbench Tory
Eurosceptics who earlier this year latched on to fishing as an anti-EU
issue. He said that the Eurosceptics' call for a unilateral British
pullout from the EU's common fisheries policy (CFP) would have lost the
UK fishing industry #500m a year in exports and would have involved the
Government in five years of separate negotiations with every EU member
state.
But Mr Baldry caused confusion when he admitted to reporters that
after Spanish entry to the rich fisheries of the Irish Box -- two thirds
of which is in Irish territory -- there would be some British losers.
''The logical conclusion is that within the Irish Box the amount of
fish taken by Irish and UK vessels will decrease,'' he said. But after
talks with fisheries officials he said that he might have misled
reporters on that point.
One of his officials later sought to clarify this by explaining that
British quotas for fish would not be affected by the Spanish accession.
If Spain's arrival does mean fewer fish those boats most affected will
be from English ports. For the Scots the deal is better than seemed
possible when the EU first set out to bring forward the accession of
Spain and Portugal to CFP as fully-integrated members. Spanish access to
western waters will be allowed from January 1 instead of the beginning
of the year 2003.
Under the agreement the fishing fleets of all nations in the Irish Box
will require only to log their catches as before. But the Spanish must
announce their entry and exit as well as keeping a log. All EU boats
will be subject to routine and spot checks and liable to aerial and
sea-going surveillance.
No new Spanish vessels will be allowed into the Irish Sea, the North
Sea or the Bristol Channel.
Ministers agreed to double the EU's budget for fisheries control
measures to #164m over five years. Britain will share in that money and
add to it from national resources.
The whole fisheries package now means that from January 1 the maximum
number of Spanish boats permitted in the Irish Box will be 40 at any one
time. No more than 150 Spanish and Portuguese, including the 40 in the
box, will be permitted into western waters -- which stretch from west of
Shetland to the Bay of Biscay -- at any one time unless they fish for
fewer hours in which case the number could rise to around 220.
All nations will be required to maintain so-called ''relative
stability'' in the western waters fishing grounds. There will be no
increase in the total fishing effort and the Spanish will have no new
rights to quota fish (the most popular species).
In the area of western waters most fished by the Scots fleet -- mainly
in the northern sector -- only 23 Spanish boats will be allowed at any
one time. Eighteen of these can land white fish and five will land
pelagics (mainly herring and mackerel).
In the area of the Irish Box most fished by the Scots -- off northwest
Ireland -- only eight Spanish boats will be permitted at any one time.
The box itself officially disappears at the end of this year but the
controls agreed yesterday mean that in effect it will survive in another
form. The Shetland Box is not affected.
Mr Forsyth said the outcome of the talks was positive. ''It ensures
that we determine the rules under which our fishermen operate in our
waters.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond, however, accused Mr Forsyth of reinforcing
Scotland's ''third class status in Europe''. He claimed that Scottish
Office Ministers had attended only 10 Council of Ministers meetings
since April 1994, despite there being an average of 124 such meetings a
year.
The deal agreed today, which came originally from proposals by the
Scottish industry itself, can be seen as a victory for common sense over
bureaucracy.

<HEADLINE>Sell-off worth #6.1m. Malaysian laird for Glenavon</HEADLINE>

A CORE expanse of the Cairngorms has been sold to a foreign company,
underlining the influx of lairds from abroad taking over significant
chunks of Scotland.
Glenavon, a 41,000-acre estate formerly owned by members of the Wills
tobacco family, is now in the hands of Andras Ltd, which paid #6.1m. It
is understood the latest absentee landlord is a wealthy Malaysian
businessman.
The Herald revealed in July that some Highland estates were open to
private approaches ''if the price was right'', and that foreign interest
in ownership was soaring. It also disclosed the Far East was
increasingly fertile ground for sales to individuals or consortia.
The sale of Glenavon -- which was not advertised on the open market --
is destined to spark fresh political debate over land use, ownership,
and tenure in Scotland, and cause concern among environmentalist groups.
Fears are growing that too many estates are literally the playthings
of rich, absentee lairds who buy on a whim from Scottish selling agents.
However, it would appear that Andras Ltd and its publicity-shy owner
will meet Scottish National Heritage aims of enhancing the Cairngorms'
environment by pursuing a positive management programme.
The estate, which includes Delnabo Hill and the Bridgets' salmon
fishing, embraces areas described by the former Countryside Commission
for Scotland as of outstanding beauty. It also has sites designated of
special scientific interest and proposed or designated world heritage or
natural heritage areas.
The purchase comes within months of the dust settling over ownership
of another jewel in the Cairngorms crown, Mar Lodge.
That saga ended thanks only to National Lottery money being made
available to the National Trust for Scotland, a move welcomed by the
World Wide Fund for Nature.
It is estimated one in three Highland sporting estates are already in
the hands of offshore, often faceless, interests.
Andras Ltd, which did not appear in a trawl of UK company records,
already owns Braulen estate in Inverness-shire -- where staff are
allegedly sworn to secrecy over the takeover and affect on their lives.
London lawyers and a Scottish-based agent for Andras Ltd yesterday
declined to throw any light on the firm, reputedly owned by a wealthy
Malaysian with connections to the Sultan of Brunei, the world's richest
man.
The sultan, who earlier this year received an honorary doctor of laws
degree from Aberdeen University, has a personal fortune of around #22bn.
Andras Ltd already has a management plan with Scottish National
Heritage in place at Braulen, where money is being poured in by the new
owner.
Glenavon, sold by Wiltshire-based Sir David Seton and his wife
Gillian, lies partly within the counties of Banff and Aberdeen, and
includes Inchrory Lodge at Tomintoul.
A spokesman for Scottish National Heritage said last night that it was
not interested in the nationality of landowners but concerned about how
land was managed, adding that SNH had a good relationship with Andras
Ltd at Braulen.

SCOTRAIL is having to pay InterCity West Coast more than #1m in the
current year to hire drivers for use on sleeper services to Scotland, at
least 100% more than it would cost ScotRail to use its own drivers.
The figures were revealed yesterday by Labour's transport spokesman,
Mr Brian Wilson. He warned that although the services were in ScotRail's
passenger service requirement, it was still open to operators to seek
permission to cut their number.
He said: ''Three InterCity depots, at Polmadie, Preston, and Euston,
are respectively charging ScotRail #517,557, #240,000, and #463,998.
''This is in order to provide drivers for two trains per night in each
direction, six days a week. The mark-up involved is incredible, at least
double what direct employment of the drivers would cost the operator.
''Yet this #1.23m is now a cost which those sleeper services will have
to carry. On that kind of basis, it is not difficult to imagine that
their economics will soon, again, be called into question.''
Mr Wilson continued: ''The cost base of railway services must be
urgently reviewed and reality restored, if it is not to present an
ongoing threat to marginal services.''
A ScotRail official said last night that she would not dispute Mr
Wilson's figures.
''We know these are inflated costs but they are a short-term measure.
Basically when we took over sleeper services eight months ago we did not
have sufficient staff and the position on the sleepers has only been
finalised recently.
''We use ScotRail drivers where possible. We will be making long-term
arrangements to use our own drivers as soon as possible.''
A spokesman for InterCity West Coast said: ''We have contracts with
ScotRail and, as with our other contracts, they are our business. End of
story.''

produce chips for smartcards -- bank cards with built-in protection
against fraud.
It has confirmed that its main Scottish plants will form a key part of
its bid to meet a massive anticipated increase in demand for the
devices.
It is investing more than #60m, and will create 100 jobs.
Production of the smartcard microchips is to start soon at Motorola's

announced last year at its East Kilbride plant will enable the company
to handle a new manufacturing process which could double output levels
there.

BRITISH Rail was accused last night of tearing up a penalty fare
issued to Lord Sterling, the chairman of P &amp; O Ferries and a former
Government adviser, who was caught last month travelling in a
first-class carriage without a ticket.
Labour last night released a letter from the managing director of
South West Trains which asks the official in charge of penalty
collection to drop the case because Lord Sterling might ''find the
matter extremely embarrassing''.
The 60-year-old peer was travelling on the 17.54 from London Waterloo
to Haslemere on September 6 without a ticket. He was issued with a
penalty fare notice by the conductor, with a fine of #31.20.
According to Labour transport spokesman Brian Wilson, who has received
copies of the documents involved, Lord Sterling demanded to know the
name of the director of the train company operating the service.
He then telephoned Mr Peter Field, who is leading a management buy-out
attempt, the following day, and a day later Mr Field intervened to have
the penalty cancelled.
In his letter, dated September 8, Mr Field writes to Mr Colin Newman
of the Penalty Fares Office that the fine was issued ''quite properly
and correctly''. However, he adds: ''On reflection, I have decided that
it is probably not appropriate for South West Trains to require the
payment of this fare, or to impose a penalty in this instance.
''I would be obliged if you could delete on your computer and records
all references to this notice.''
Mr Field then adds in a hand-written postscript: ''You will have
guessed from the above that the person concerned would find the matter
extremely embarrassing.''
Mr Wilson said last night: ''This is the kind of two-tier railway the
Tories dream of, in which Lord Sterling travels free and the peasantry
subsidise him. What sort of message does this send out to the rest of
the travelling public, when Lord Sterling can travel first class without
a ticket and then avoid paying the penalty when he gets caught?''
The incident has been reported to British Tansport Police by
''outraged inspectors'' and Mr Field is to visit the BR Revenue
Protection Support Service in Portsmouth on Tuesday to explain his
actions, Mr Wilson said.
The penalty fare form notes that it was issued at 18.06, in first
class. The reason given is that Lord Sterling was travelling without a
ticket. It lists his surname as Sterling, his forename as Lord, and his
address as 79 Pall Mall, London SW1. It is signed by him as Sterling of
Plaistow.
Lord Sterling, who was ennobled in 1991, has been chairman of P &amp; O
since 1983.

PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin suffered a second heart attack within four
months yesterday, raising doubts as to how long he can continue in
office.
Mr Yeltsin, exhausted by a trip to the United States and France, was
taken to hospital in Moscow but the Kremlin was quick to stress that the
64-year-old president was not in danger and remained in command.
Under the constitution, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would
automatically take over the reins of power if the president was
incapacitated.
Mr Chernomyrdin's spokesman said yesterday that the prime minister had
made no changes in his schedule.
Mr Yeltsin wields so much power in Russia that political analysts say
it is hard to imagine what would happen if he were totally
incapacitated.
They said it was too early to write off Yeltsin, but his ability to
carry out gruelling foreign trips, part and parcel of being head of
state, was not clear. Aides said a trip to China next month had been
cancelled and an important Bosnia summit scheduled for next Tuesday
might have to be postponed or scrapped.
If Yeltsin stayed out of action for long, it would unsettle Russia
before December parliamentary elections, in which voters will pass
judgment on reforms which are creating a Western style economy and
throwing millions below the poverty line.
''The net result is that even if Yeltsin comes out of this, it throws
the political future of the country into doubt at a rather delicate
time,'' said one Western diplomat.
''Judging from Yeltsin's recovery the last time he was ill -- in July
-- it would be too early to say that he is completely finished,'' the
diplomat said. ''If he is carefully handled, he could go on for some
time. But he is bound to slow his pace.''
Chief aide Viktor Ilyushin told Itar-Tass news agency that the Kremlin
leader was taken ill at a country residence outside Moscow as he worked
on official papers and was flown to hospital immediately by helicopter.
The Kremlin hurried to announce that Mr Yeltsin, who has been dogged
by uncertain health for years, was not in danger and was still at the
helm.
''There is no question of replacing Yeltsin. The president is in
charge. There is no indication so far that he cannot carry out his
duties,'' Kremlin spokesman Igor Ignatyev told reporters.
Mr Ilyushin blamed the heart attack on the demands of his five-day
trip to France and the US where he had a summit meeting with President
Bill Clinton. He returned to Moscow on Tuesday.
The illness was ''linked to intellectual, moral, and physical stresses
which the president experienced during his last trip'', Ilyushin
declared.
Western medical experts said yesterday it was too soon to count out Mr
Yeltsin but that his second heart scare in four months should ring alarm
bells at the Kremlin.
''You're not necessarily looking at a life-threatening situation but
one would take very serious stock of all possible alternatives to
prevent a third episode,'' said Professor Brian Pentecost, medical
director of the British Heart Foundation.
His condition, medically described as ischaemia, occurs when there is
an inadequate supply of blood, and therefore oxygen, due to an
obstructed flow of blood from an artery. Caused by a build-up of plaque
blocking an artery, it can lead to an attack or stroke. The condition
can be mild or serious.
''When any patient has two episodes in such quick succession, the
doctors would be thinking seriously about the advisability of surgical
options,'' said Professor Pentecost.
The blocking can be treated with drugs or surgery but often worsens if
patients do not make radical lifestyle changes.
A top Kremlin aide said a final diagnosis would be made today but
insisted there was no need for an operation.
Yeltsin appeared to have made a full recovery from his attack in July.
On the eve of his trip to France on October 20 and 21, Mr Yeltsin told
French journalists he was ready to take on French President Jacques
Chirac at tennis.
Mr Yeltsin, an unpredictable character, has fuelled speculation about
his health by a series of stumbling performances in recent months.
However, he seemed in fine fettle in the US as he joked with Mr Clinton
at a joint press conference.
He has often looked unwell and walks stiffly. Kremlin aides have
repeatedly put his difficulties down to a back ailment.
He openly admits to liking alcohol but his aides have always denied
suggestions he has a drink problem. Nevertheless, critics point to his
slip-ups and note that he is often puffy-faced, unsteady on his feet,
and loose with words.
The downturn in Mr Yeltsin's health comes at a particularly awkward
time for the Kremlin as Russia gears itself for a parliamentary election
on December 17 in which Mr Yeltsin has vowed to try to stop a communist
victory.
He also faces a presidential election in June 1996 but so far has
declined to confirm whether or not he will run.
* The Commons got itself into a muddle over the fate of President
Yeltsin. Leader of the House Tony Newton first expressed the shock and
sadness of the Commons at the death of Mr Yeltsin -- only to find out
minutes later he was still alive.
