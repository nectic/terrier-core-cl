The first time I went to the Honda factory at Swindon, it was
operating on quite a modest scale, although the company had plans to
extend its activities by a substantial amount. That process is certainly
well under way. Swindon now produces Accords and the latest five-door
Civic design. It has a successful export programme, and its present
capacity of 100,000 vehicles per year will be increased by the end of
the century to half as many again, thanks to a #330 million investment.
Part of the impetus has been provided by the cutting of its links with
Rover. It hit Honda very hard when Rover was sold off to BMW, not just
because all the co-operative machinery which had been put in place
between the British and Japanese companies would obviously grind to a
halt, but also because some people within Honda regard their own company
as the BMW of the Far East.
The five-door Civic is now in the showrooms at prices from #11,495 to
#14,295. This is the last Honda project sharing components and general
appearance with Rover. It is built in a factory operating, like others
which are Japanese-owned, to a company philosophy which may make some
visitors feel edgy, but is accepted by the staff, all called
''associates''.
As well as an interesting tour of a factory which already has space to
put in a third-model production line, there was time for a brief
introductory drive in some of the new cars. The range includes a
1.4-litre whose 90bhp is matched by the 1.5-litre VTEC-E economy model,
a 1.6-litre boosted to 113bhp, and the 1.6-litre VTEC SR which offers a
peak power output of 126bhp.
This is a neatly-proportioned car, with a front end which has its own
obvious identity, something not easy to achieve these days when so many
family cars are following similar badge-and-grille styling. Impeccable
quality control is apparent in the fit and finish of the body panels,
and much the same can be said about the interior.
The Civic's road manners are fine, although one version I tried was
thrown about erratically by the wind. Then I went away in my own car,
which was being chucked around even more, and I started to hear radio
reports of vans being blown over in 75mph gusts. Normally, the Honda has
no stability problems.
There is quite a difference in performance levels, but that is partly
explained by the fact that, whereas the VTEC SR model is a sports
saloon, the similarly labelled VTEC-E, less than 100cc smaller in
capacity, is a lean-burn super economy car. If its acceleration seems
quite modest, then fuel returns up to 58mpg at 56mph are a very
acceptable trade-off, especially as all the regular Honda refinement is
retained.

AGRICULTURE Minister Angela Browning agreed yesterday to look into
allegations that live veal calves are being transported to the Continent
via back-door exports through the Scottish port of Cairnryan.
The issue was raised during agriculture questions in the Commons by
Scottish Labour MP Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West) who said there were
reports that English farmers, keen to escape the demonstrations at south
of England ports, were using Cairnryan as a means of exporting their
animals.
Mr Canavan said the animals were being shipped to Larne in County
Antrim, then smuggled across the Ulster border before being shipped to
the Continent via ports in the Irish Republic.
He told the Commons: ''By the time they have reached their intended
destination they have, in some cases, travelled over 2500 miles.''
Mr Canavan demanded that the Government should hold talks on the
matter with Ministers from the Scottish Office, the Northern Ireland
Office and the Minister responsible for agriculture in the Republic.
Mrs Browning said she ''certainly'' would look into the situation, and
urged Mr Canavan to provide her with evidence to back up his
allegations.
He later told The Herald that he already had sent evidence to the
Ministry of Agriculture.
However, the Labour MP met opposition from Mr Roy Beggs, Ulster
Unionist MP for Antrim East, who accused him of spreading a
''falsehood'' and said there was no evidence to support the allegations
he was making.
He said the Scottish Office sent him records of all transfers of live
cattle being shipped from Scotland to Larne and he had found no evidence
to support Mr Canavan's claims.

SCOTTISH football was in mourning yesterday, but the sense of loss at
the death of Davie Cooper was felt most acutely at Kilbowie Park, Ibrox,
and Fir Park, the three grounds where the former Scottish
internationalist regularly displayed his astounding natural skills and
thrilled genuine supporters of every team. Genius is always a joy to
behold and Cooper was one of the few players who could force parents to
take their children to matches.
That in itself speaks volumes for the winger, who died in Glasgow's
Southern General Hospital yesterday morning after having suffered a
subarachnoid haemorrhage the previous day, and his death has snatched
from the game and from the children, who will be the players of
tomorrow, a decent man who held a great gift.
A friend, Jimmy Nicholl, player-manager of Raith Rovers, was one of
the first to react and he called Clydebank offering support to have
tomorrow's first-division match between the teams postponed until April
4. Motherwell and Hibernian also postponed yesterday's reserve-team
match as a mark of respect.
Yesterday it emerged that Cooper had intended embarking on a venture
to impart some of his knowledge and skills to youngsters. In conjunction
with his first and last club, Clydebank, he was about to start what
would have been called the David Cooper Soccer School, which would have
travelled the country preaching the gospel to wide-eyed youngsters. It
was to begin in the Orkneys in June and there were plans to travel into
America also.
The concept was, and is, a good one because children relate more to
star footballers rather than coaches and the notion of linking Cooper
with a team of coaches held great appeal.
It would be a fitting tribute to a player of mesmeric abilities if the
schoolcould still be launched in his name, with others of the game's
heroes filling in at the various stops around the country.
''It was our intention to take football to the children of the
country,'' said Jack Steedman, the power behind Clydebank. Steedman also
was one of the guiding figures in Cooper's own development and his sense
of personal loss yesterday was deep as he watched supporters come and go
quietly at Kilbowie, where they set down floral tributes to the winger.
As the first of the mourners started arriving at the first-division
club, further up the Clyde people within Ibrox were shuffling around in
solemn mood. Ally McCoist, who was particularly close to Cooper, had
been at the hospital and returned to Ibrox to speak on behalf of the
players.
''This is a very distressing time,'' he said, ''and I'm sure you can
all appreciate how we are feeling. It is as though we have lost a
brother, someone who was with us and a part of our lives.
''As a person he was one of the best and he meant so much to myself
and the players in the dressing room, and, although he was away from the
club, I think it is safe to say he never really left. Our thoughts are
with his family.''
It was obvious McCoist had shed tears through the morning and the
club's manager Walter Smith also was clearly distressed. ''When I looked
around at my players, especially those who were here with Davie, I could
see they were devastated by the news,'' he said.
''Davie was very much his own man, but he was very popular with the
players.
''When I came here eight years ago and saw him up close, it was then I
realised just how good he was. He would have been able to walk into any
Rangers team of any era and we all feel a great sense of loss.
''First and foremost Davie was a Rangers man and he never tried to
hide that, but I think he was appreciated by most supporters because of
his ability. It was a gift and he used it. Without him, this is a very
sombre place. We feel for his mother, father, and his brother.''
John Greig, Rangers' public relations executive, was a team-mate and a
manager of Cooper and he recalled: ''My first sighting of Davie was when
he was playing with Clydebank against Rangers in a league cup tie which
took about three games to settle.
''When he came to Ibrox, I remember playing at left back behind him
and some of the things he did bamboozled me.''
Greig eventually became manager and he added that while Cooper was
never one for tackling or the physical side of the game, his skill level
was exceptional. ''He used to say: 'I'm not interested in tactics, I'm
an entertainer,' and he was. He was as good a footballer produced in
Scotland for a long, long time and I think he never moved into European
football because he was very happy here.
''I had a conversation with him only a few weeks ago during which we
talked about his change of attitude, because when he was younger he
always said he had no ambition to continue in the game when he stopped
playing. Yet, he was coaching youngsters. I suppose as you get older,
your ideas change.
''While we are all sad, his memory will live on.''
Jock Wallace, the former Rangers manager who signed Cooper from
Clydebank in 1977, was stunned by the news. ''It is so hard to take this
in,'' he said. ''My feelings go out to his family and loved ones, who
will have to be strong through this ordeal.
''Scottish football doesn't produce many players who can be described
as world-class, but Davie was one who belonged in that company.''
Motherwell's manager Alex McLeish, who was one of Cooper's
international team-mates, said: ''Motherwell and Scottish football are
deeply saddened by Davie's untimely death. The club is in a state of
shock.
''Davie was inspirational to everyone during his four outstanding
seasons at the club, the highlight being the Scottish Cup final in
1991.''
SFA chief executive Jim Farry echoed McLeish's words and also added:
''It is tragic that one with such skills and knowledge will no longer be
able to impart them to young players.''
Cooper's former manager at Fir Park, Tommy McLean, spoke to the winger
recently and was taken by how well he was looking. ''Davie never had a
flu, he nevr missed training,'' McLean said.
''When he went to Motherwell from Rangers, He was very influential and
helped give the young players confidence in their own abilities.''
Cooper was the last of the great Scottish wingers and one of them,
Celtic's own Jimmy Johnstone, spoke of his own sense of loss. ''His poor
family must be devastated,'' he began.
''You think about me and Willie Henderson and even further back to
Willie Waddell and Gordon Smith. Then came Davie and, sadly, there is no
Scottish player left to follow him.
''In many ways Davie was more than a winger. He was so skilful he
could have played anywhere. Dads took their sons to see him and even the
other half of the Old Firm could appreciate him.
''Anyone who loved football loved watching Davie Cooper. He was one of
Scotland's finest ever players.''

MOTHERWELL completed the #400,000 transfer of central defender Mitchel
van der Gaag yesterday and the Dutchman will make his debut against
Celtic at Hampden a week tomorrow. The 23-year-old has signed a
three-year deal and intends relaunching his career, which had stalled
with PSV Eindhoven.
Alex McLeish, who knows a thing or two about central defenders, and
his assistant at Fir Park watched van der Gaag twice each and both are
convinced he will enhance the side.
''He has a presence and is strong in the air,'' McLeish said, ''but
Dutch players are taught to pass the ball, and that is how I want
Motherwell to play. In fact, he has a lot of qualities which he can
bring to us.''
McLeish believes van der Gaag will bridge the gap between the
experienced players at Fir Park and the younger ones ''who are not quite
ready yet.''
The player himself realised he would have to find another club soon
after former Holland national team coach Dick Advocaat took over at PSV
and brought in other defenders. ''He had other ideas and I wanted to get
away and start again,'' said van der Gaag.
''There were other clubs interested, but Motherwell were the club who
made the offer. They are ambitious and I am ambitious, so we will see
what happens from here.''
He added that he took advice from one or two players, but especially
former Aberdeen striker Hans Gillhaus before making up his mind to
settle in Scotland.

SCOTLAND team manager Craig Brown has hauled Duncan Shearer into his
squad for Russia and the crucial European Championship clash in Moscow
after a surgeon's report ruled out Duncan Ferguson.
Brown had hoped that Everton star Ferguson would be able to play --
and had based some of his forward planning around the one-time Ibrox
attacker -- but a fax containing the medical report from Goodison was
accepted by Brown. He moved immediately to bring in Shearer to join his
old Fort William mate John McGinlay as the most likely front pairing for
the game.
Shearer said yesterday: ''When John and I used to play together at
Fort William we never thought we would be in the same Scotland team --
now that is a possibility and I would like it to happen.
''I believe we can form a profitable partnership. We have come up the
hard way through non-League football and no-one would ever have believed
this possible. But maybe we can spark off each other.''
Brown added: ''We had looked to Duncan Ferguson to add something
different to our game but the medical report is there, and he cannot
join us. Ferguson would have been good at set-pieces, but we still have
Colin Hendry, and Shearer and John McGinlay are useful enough in these
situations.''
Meanwhile, Brown was boosted when the Russians announced their squad
in Moscow yesterday -- despite naming five strikers. Star defender
Sergei Gorlukovich, who plays in Germany for Bayer Leverkusen, is out.
Brown claimed: ''He is their best defender. He is very disciplined,
very strong, and they will not be as good in defence without him.''
Russian coach Oleg Romantsev has also axed strikers Igor Simutenkov
and Rashid Rakhimov after having lost to Slovakia. Full squad:
Goalkeepers: Sergei Ochimnikov, Dimitry Kharin, Stanislav Cherechesov.
Defenders: Dimitry Khlesov, Yuri Nikiforov, Viktor Onopko, Vasily
Kulkov, Yuri Kovtun.
Midfield: Andrei Pyntritski, Omari Tetrazde, Andrei Kanchelskis,
Valery Karpin, Igor Shalimov, Ilya Tsymbaler, Alexander Mostovoi.
Forwards: Dimitry Radchenko, Sergei Kiryakov, Vladislav Radimov,
Vladimir Besschaltkykh, Nikolai Pisarev.
* ANDY Cole, the #7m Manchester United striker, was last night called
into the England squad for next week's friendly against Uruguay at
Wembley. He replaces Blackburn's Alan Shearer, who had to pull out after
failing to recover from a knee injury.

JOCKEY Adelle Gibbons was injured yesterday at the end of the opening
race of the Flat turf season at Doncaster.
The young apprentice sustained wrist and ankle injuries when she fell
from her mount, the third horse Risky Tu, and was kicked by other horses
after they were hampered by runner-up Shadow Leader in the Raceform
Apprentice Handicap.
The stewards found that Shadow Leader, ridden by Richard Painter, had
interfered with Risky Tu two strides after passing the post and he was
banned for three days.

IT IS a poignant irony that, when he was asked to choose his most
significant game, Davie Cooper picked out the Scotland victory over
Wales in 1985, the night Jock Stein died. Not since that moment in
Cardiff has Scottish football been left as devastatingly numb as it is
today, yet the death of this supremely fit 39-year-old athlete
inevitably leaves us mystified as well as shocked.
Tributes will be plentiful, of course, and a player of such exquisite
talent deserves all of them, but the finest service the game in this
country could offer in his memory is to harness the collective
appreciation that his death has spawned to make room for any budding
Davie Cooper that is playing keepie-uppie in some playground at the
moment.
If the game in Scotland is lurching towards a scenario which excludes
exceptional talents unless they conform to the industrious mediocrity of
today's premier division, there could be no better moment to call a
halt.
Cooper was perhaps the worst marker in football of the last two
decades. In the time-honoured football phrase, he could not tackle a
fish supper.
There were times during his finest era when he was seen in a match
less than the far side linesman, but if he played for as much as 15
minutes, the people went home talking about that quarter of an hour and
the game invariably had been won.
Cooper was an individual, on and off the park. In his prime he was no
great lover of publicity, often refusing to talk to pressmen, but he
matured into an articulate observer of the business in which he
excelled.
In his earlier days, however, it was impossible to avoid the
impression that he played football only because he happened to be good
at it. He never said as much, but when he wasn't in the team the
suspicion was that he would have preferred a day at the races (one of
his other passions) than a seat in the stand.
It was that very individuality, of course, which he took with him on
to the football field and made him different from the rest. It made no
sense to Cooper that he had to expend energy chasing up and down the
field. He liked to play with the ball, a predilection which no doubt
would disturb some of today's teachers of the zonal game.
If someone else had the ball, Davie would wait until it was his turn
again and, when that came, he did things with it that left most of his
contemporaries gasping in admiration.
He leaves many great memories at Clydebank, Ibrox and Fir Park, as
well as on the international fields. His stunning free kick in the Skol
Cup final that beat Aberdeen's Jim Leighton was one he liked to recall,
for example, and the thrill of travelling on an open-topped bus with
Motherwell (''the first time I had done that'') after their Scottish Cup
win, was another.
The night in Cardiff, when he went through all the emotions that are
available to man in the one evening, remained very special. Cooper was
on the bench but, in the last of a career full of inspirational moments,
Stein brought him on for Gordon Strachan early in the second half. He
made a major impact, so much so that Roy Aitken handed him the ball to
take the penalty that was to keep Scotland's qualifying hopes alive.
The joy was not to last long and, in his reminiscences, Davie admitted
never to have felt so cold and lonely on the way home that eventful
night.
There are a lot of people who played alongside him going through the
same sense of loss today, not to mention the many thousands who thrilled
to his skills.
Nothing can bring back Davie Cooper but if those with the power to do
so vow that they will make the changes required to reopen the gates for
players of his rarity, there would be no better memorial.
Too many people at the sharp end of the game are afraid of giving the
skilful precedence over the diligent. Workers are the modern game's
elite because they are the safer bet, albeit more likely to prevent
defeat than bring victory.
There are tangible ways to commemorate Cooper, like naming one or
other of the youth coaching schemes which he held close to his heart
after him. Maybe Rangers or Motherwell or Clydebank will honour him in
some special way. He deserves any or all of that, but his own passion
for the skills of the beautiful game would be best served if every
manager, every coach, promised from this day on to select the best and
most skilful players for his team, however much of a risk to his own
livelihood it represented.
There may not be any more Davie Coopers waiting out there, but the
only way to find out is by giving them the chance.
Wherever the man himself is, someone will be having a miserable time
trying to take the ball off him.

DUNDEE United mifielder David Hannah will miss the crucial relegation
battle with Falkirk at Brockville on April 8.
The Scotland Under-21 player was booked in the 4-2 reserve defeat by
Celtic on Wednesday afternoon and the SFA did not even have to wait for
the referee's report before revealing that he will be suspended for the
Falkirk match.
Hannah had already collected 15 disciplinary points and automatically
faces a one-game ban no matter how the latest booking is assessed.
Ironically, he only played against Celtic's second string because he
was rested from the first team against Hearts on Tuesday night in the
hope that he would recover his freshness and prove an asset in United's
battle against relegation.
Brian Welsh missed the 1-1 draw with Hearts because of suspension and
several other United players are hovering on the brink of SFA action.
Meanwhile, Uruguayan midfield man Juan Ferreri is likely to make his
return from an ankle injury when United's reserves meet Partick Thistle
at Armadale on Tuesday. The South American has still to start a
first-team match with United.

JOHN Toshack, sacked as coach of Real Sociedad earlier this season,
will manage Spanish high-flyers Deportivo Coruna next year.
Club president Augusto Lendoiro said yesterday that the former Welsh
internationalist will replace current coach Aresenio Iglesias, who said
in January he would not renew his contract at the end of this season
after five years at the Riazor stadium.
''Toshack was the first and only choice. Negotiations started a month
after Arsenio decided he would not stay on next year,'' said Lendoiro.
''Toshack had plenty of other offers, both here and abroad.''
Lendoiro said minor deatils of the move were unresolved, but he
expected Toshack to sign a two-year contract with the Galician club,
last season's league runners-up.
Toshack first joined Real Sociedad as coach in 1985 and took them to
Spanish Cup success in 1987. Two years later he was lured to Real
Madrid, but was fired in 1991 and returned to San Sebastian and his
former club. He was sacked on November 24 after a series of poor
results.

IF Davie Cooper was the most gifted player of his generation, then
Kenny Dalglish, just five years older, was the most lauded.
While Cooper won just 22 Scottish international caps during his
career, Dalglish collected 80 more than that.
While Cooper stayed in Scotland to demonstrate his skills -- and often
found them over-looked and under-valued because of his own insularity --
Dalglish carried his ability to the bigger stage of the English first
division.
Then, with Liverpool's domestic successes as his springboard, he
paraded his talents across Europe.
Cooper, however, was never a man to look to the broader horizons of
the game he graced.
Dalglish, looking back at his one-time Old Firm rival and sometime
Scotland team-mate, had an answer for that last night.
''Davie Cooper just didn't demand anything from the game,'' he said.
''All he wanted to do was play. He wasn't all that keen on training, and
he certainly didn't get himelf involved in all the trappings of success
which can follow a great player -- which he was.
''Davie just wanted to go out on the field, play and then head off
back to his home in Lanarkshire.
''He was one of the most unassuming people I have ever met in the game
and it's a tragedy this should happen to him.
''He was a naturally gifted player, and going out on to the field and
doing what only he could do was never a problem to him.
''Any problems he had came with the off-field hassles. I don't think
Davie ever fully understood why he should have to speak to the media.
I'm not saying that he was ever rude to anyone -- it was just something
he never grasped.
''Basically, he didn't think all of that had anything to do with the
game itself -- and it was only the game which mattered to him.
''I can remember playing against him on Old Firm games and people used
to say to you that Davie could always be handled because he was very
much a left-footed player and so if you looked out for that you could
keep him quiet.
''That wasn't quite the way of it because Davie had a left foot which
was a little bit special. As well as that, whenever there was a dead
ball situation and Coop was there then you knew you were in trouble.
''He was a one-off. Unique. He was just Davie Cooper a player who was
happy playing football, having a wee bet, maybe a pint with his mates,
and staying out of the limelight.
''He never asked for much, only the chance to play the game his way.''
Former Scotland and Manchester United boss Tommy Docherty recalled:
''I tried to buy Davie from Clydebank when I was at Old Trafford. I
offered Jack Steedman #100,000 and even at that time I knew I was the
one getting the bargain if he came to United.
''This was before Rangers tried for him, but Davie always had that
feeling for Ibrox and that beat me in the end.
''I can't believe this has happened. He was a world class player --
and we haven't had too many of these in Scotland -- but he was also a
person who never forgot a kindness or a favour.
''He used to always thank me for having that interest in him when he
was just a young player at Kilbowie. He didn't have to do that. I wanted
him because he had the kind of skills the Old Trafford support loved.
For me he was up there with all the great Scottish wingers.
''I might have got him for just #100,000 -- yet at today's values it
would need seven or eight million pounds to sign a Davie Cooper. People
will tell you there are not many of his kind left.
''The sad truth is there aren't any of his type of player remaining in
the game. He was a collector's item and that's how I will always
remember him . . .''
Celtic manager Tommy Burns added his tribute and those of his club
when he remembered: ''There was one game I'll never forget when we beat
Clydebank 6-5 and Davie Cooper scored a hat trick in that game. He was
incredible. Throughout his career he was an inspiration for everyone in
the game.
''You can still remember some of the goals he scored. Some of them
meant I was on the losing side, but that didn't make them less
memorable. He was one of the great players and he was gifted.
''Kenny Dalglish, for instance, had to work harder than Davie did to
achieve what he did. With Davie it just happened.''

* THE jail sentence handed down yesterday to Eric Cantona, who was
later granted bail, allegations of match fixing, the sacking of Arsenal
manager George Graham after a Premier League inquiry, and crowd trouble
have combined to undermine the credibility of English football, and
while the general belief may be that recent revelations are the tip of
the iceberg, there are those determined to defend the many decent people
employed in the game. PAT NEVIN (left) is one of them.
The Scotland and Tranmere Rovers player is the highly-respected
chairman of the English Professional Footballers' Association and,
writing exclusively for Herald readers, he offers his view of the
problems which have transported football from the back to the front
pages. Nevin, whose association has to help and advise the most humble
to the most popular players and managers, writes with a passion and deep
concern for the game.
ERIC Cantona's violent outburst at Selhurst Park which led to his
court appearance yesterday was inexcusable, even if the abuse he
suffered was racist, extremely offensive, and very personal. There can
be no place in the game for his reactions and that is why the internal
measures taken by the FA and Manchester United were suitably severe.
I believe someone has to be reasonable on behalf of the profession, no
matter how unstylish their stance may be.
However, I am very concerned at the severity of the jail sentence,
because it is possible Cantona's celebrity status had an adverse effect
on what happened in Croydon Magistrates Court. If this were to be the
case the Professional Footballers' Association would be most anxious,
because we would expect our members to be treated no better or no worse
than any other individual.
Cantona's behaviour was unprecedented in our game, arguably the
perfect example of the exception proving the rule. Players generally
show excellent self-control in high pressure situations. In a tense
match, with the adrenalin pumping and the opposition fans howling
torrents of abuse, it takes real professionalism not to react.
In the heat of the moment Cantona did, and his punishment before
yesterday was perhaps severe enough, although the court obviously felt
otherwise. Some may believe a custodial sentence justified, but is it
fair that an individual should be doubly punished because of his fame?
No matter which way you look at Cantona's behaviour and the subsequent
punitive measures the credibility of the English game is hanging by a
slender thread. A thread that could well snap if other controversies,
such as the current betting allegations, are proven and this is found to
be widespread. However, I think it is very unlikely that match-rigging
will turn out to be commonplace.
I remember scanning the reports after the original Bruce Grobelaar
allegations surfaced last November. When prominent players and
ex-players were asked for a reaction, one word constantly recurred --
shocked. In a business were hyperbole is the norm, for once ''shocked'
was not an exaggeration.
The most respected men in football were collectively amazed by the
story, simply because they had never even heard the slightest suggestion
that it could be happening. If match-rigging was rife in such a close
knit game, surely there would have been some rumours on the grapevine?
But there weren't any.
As a union the PFA will strenuously defend its members . . . but only
to a point. Throwing games strikes at the very ethos of the sport. That
is why we fully support any investigations the police feel they need to
make. If any of our members are found guilty in this respect then we
will be duty-bound to accept the severest sanctions the law and football
can provide.
What we cannot accept are some of the methods the police have employed
so far. The dawn raids with an attendant media circus were disgraceful.
A simple phone call to the clubs concerned and each of the suspected
players would have happily turned up at the police stations.
None of the players were charged, and if any are proved to be innocent
in the long run, then the distress caused to them, their families and
their friends will have been a moral outrage.
It is, however, becoming increasingly difficult to claim the moral
high ground when defending football. The fashion now is to lump all of
football's disparate problems together and suggest the whole game is
drowning in a mire of its own sleazy corruption.
Having worked in English football for 12 years, I believe the current
stereotyping is far from the reality. It is fairer to look at each
problem independently.
Surely the game should have been shamed by the recent crowd troubles
at Stamford Bridge and Lansdowne Road? A bunch of right wing extremists,
who could not care less about football, hijacked those games. They had a
wee fight to themselves and then managed to procure, free of charge,
more press coverage for their political views than Saatchi and Saatchi
could have delivered for #10m.
Meanwhile, the real football fans were deprived of the game, out of
pocket on tickets and travel, and then put in physical danger by the
brainless bulldog bunch.
Football itself stands to lose financially as advertisers ponder their
involvement in a game with a sullied reputation. Innocent players will
also lose out if Euro 96 is called into question. Far from being shamed,
football should be bloody angry. On this occasion football was the
victim of one of our society's ills.
There are of course the ''bungs' scandals, the latest involving George
Graham. Still proclaiming his innocence, the former Arsenal manager is
unlikely to be the only one in trouble following dodgy deals with
disreputable agents.
On the positive side, maybe football can finally claim to be cleaning
up its act in this area. Albeit belatedly, and after much cajoling, from
a press corps which can on this occasion be justly proud of its
investigative journalism.
In many ways it is just what the game needed. The larger the expose
the less likely it will happen again.
Even the genuine fans, who are regularly treated like veal calves when
they travel, are turning up in greater numbers and behaving better than
they have for decades. Football is more family orientated than ever and
there has been a huge popular movement emphatically attacking racism at
matches.
The vast majority of players themselves are hard working, diligent and
professional men who are fitting role models for their young fans. For
every misdemeanour by a player that reaches the back or even front pages
I could quote thousands of examples of charity work, free kids coaching
and selfless work in the local communities.
I like, admire and respect too many people I have met in the game to
sit back and watch them all being beaten unfairly and indiscriminately
with the same big stick.
It should be understood that most people connected with football are
desperate to see the whole industry cleaned up. It if isn't, the fans
will quickly grow to despise the game they love.

FIRST division clubs face a second break in the men's domestic
programme after this weekend to allow the national Under-21 squad
prepare for their qualifying tournament in the European Junior
championship starting next month in Genoa, Italy.
Before then there are some important games.
Menzieshill have games in both Torrie Stockbrokers National League and
the Scottish Cup. In the former they are nine points off the pace with a
game in hand, but cannot afford any more mishaps if they are to keep
Grange in their sights. MIM are their opponents at Maryfield. The
Edinburgh side are the best placed of Grange's challengers and would go
top if they win both outstanding games.
Then on Sunday Menzieshill make the journey to Peffermill for their
semi-final of the cup with Western.
* HELENSBURGH may not be afamiliar name in women's hockey circles, but
that could be about to change. The club has just won the West District
League for the first time and on Sunday they will contest their first
national semi-final when they compete in the Confined Cup at Bathgate.
The club, with the help of a thriving youth section which has spawned
four of its current side in recent seasons, is arguably one of the most
progressive of the country's non-league sides. They take on Stronachs
Aberdeen GSFP.
Three hours later the second semi-final will take place between
Highland and Kelso.

THE French team which ditched Graeme Obree is in financial trouble,
threatening the career of another Scot, Robert Millar.
Le Groupement, a pyramid-sales company, ploughed #4m into their team,
signing Obree, Millar, and world road-race champion Luc Leblanc for this
season. But now, following a 35% drop in sales, the company is
threatening to withdraw from the sport.
Team manager Patrick Valke insists all will be well, and Leblanc,
currently racing in Colombia, has been told his three-year contract will
be honoured. But both he and Millar have been nervously receiving
information second-hand from France. Other teams have already contacted
Leblanc, who can be assured of continuing employment, but at 35, that is
less certain for Millar, who has a two-year contract with the team.
Millar, a former King of the Mountains winner, with a best finish of
fourth in the Tour de France in 1984, still hopes to ride the event for
the twelfth time this year, having recovered from serious knee problems
which kept him out last summer.
Ex-world pursuit champion Obree, fired by Le Groupement when he was
too ill to report for training with the team at the New Year, is due to
return to competition three weeks today, in the Good Friday meeting at
Herne Hill.

THE Scottish 100% record finally ended yesterday evening at Perth when
Tom Brewster and the Scottish men's team finally lost their unblemished
record at the final hurdle in the Bank of Scotland World Junior Curling
Championships, going down 4-3 to Germany in their ninth and last
round-robin game.
In their first game earlier yesterday, the Scottish men made quick
work of beating Finland, beating them by the thumping score of 15-1 in
just six ends.
Despite the late hiccup, the Scots go into their semi-final against
Sweden tomorrow at the top of the rankings beside Canada, who share
their won-eight-lost-one record, and who now go on to face Germany in
the other semi-final.
In her final game today, Forfar's Julia Ewart leads the Scottish women
into action against Sweden, the only other undefeated team at these
championships. Ewart convincingly won her only game yesterday, by 9-3
against Denmark, and the result of today's match will determine the
women's semi-final line-up. Results:
Men. Round 8 -- Switzerland 9, France 2; Germany 7, Sweden 6 (after
extra end); Finland 1, Scotland 15; USA 9, Denmark 6; Canada 4, Japan 2.

EDINBURGH University finished runners-up yesterday in the plate
competition at the Carlsberg International 10-a-side rugby tournament in
Hong Kong, where they lost 29-19 against Cairns Marlins in the final.
The students led 19-14 at one point with tries from Rob Henley, Dave
Officer and Oliver Byass and two conversions from Officer. But in the
intense heat the Scots faded and their more powerful opponents ran in
three tries.
In the cup final, Davetalevu from Fiji defeated Aliens, the defending
champions, 22-7. In the bowl final, USK from Wales defeated Indonesian
side ISCI 31-5.

SCOTLAND had to settle for the runners-up spot in the Home
International Women's Indoor championship in Ballymoney yesterday,
despite finishing their three-match programme with a 121-107 win over
hosts Ireland.
Earlier the Scots had seen their chance of a third successive title
disappear, when England edged out Wales 112-103 to wrap up the
championship. The best the Scots could then muster was the runners-up
spot and they duly obliged by 121-107.
Ireland, however, seeking their first win in the event, pushed them
all the way and, after trailing for most of the encounter, moved ahead
94-93 after 18 ends. The Scots then produced a grandstand finish to run
out 14-shot victors.
Roberta Hutchison beat Ann McGuinness 21-9 and Frances Haxton added a
25-15 win over Maureen Mallon. Scotland's other two wins came from
Jeanette Conlan and Nancy Davidson, who both finished 20-16 victors over
Freda Elliott and Margaret Johnston respectively.

and Robert Goldie, who had beaten Sam Torrance and Bernard Gallacher.
This time they lost after extra holes. Results:
Fourth round (Scottish result) -- D King and T Craik (Frilford Heath)
(2) beat K Stables (Montrose) and A Webster (Edzell) (+2), 1 hole.
Quarter-finals -- I Mackenzie (Hallamshire) and M Mackenzie

Florida,
EXACTLY one year ago, Greg Norman shot a 63, a score that broke the
course record at the TPC at Sawgrass, but which gave him merely a
two-stroke lead in the first round of the Players Championship.
One of three players who were in second place at 65 that day was Colin
Montgomerie, and the differences between his opening rounds last year
and this year provide an exaggerated example of what has happened in the
current edition of the Players Championship.
Montgomerie shot a seven-over-par 79 while playing well. Scoring fell
victim to a combination not present last year -- strong winds and fast
greens. The Scot said: ''I hit the ball great. I just hit the ball too
far on certain holes, which you cannot do on a golf course this severe.
It's very disappointing to come to a $3m tournament and shoot 79. Thank
God it's not the Masters.''
Because this is the best field of the year, and virtually all the best
players in the world are here, there were inevitably some good scores.
Corey Pavin, considered by many to be the best player in the game
without a major title, shot a six-under-par 66 to take a one-stroke lead
over fellow-American Gene Sauers. Bernhard Langer was tied for third
with Payne Stewart, Larry Mize, Steve Stricker, Rocco Mediate, and Lee
Janzen at three under par.
Pavin, who successfully defended his title last month at the Los
Angeles Open at Riviera Country Club -- site of this year's US PGA
Championship -- is considered one of the best putters on tour. Yesterday
he sank three putts of 12 feet and three of 20 feet or more but was more
impressed that his ball striking was just as good in yesterday's gales.
The wind seriously affected the players at the course's signature
hole, the par-3 island-green seventeenth. There were a total of 38 golf
balls struck into the water. Five players got two balls wet, including
Nick Faldo, whose quadruple-bogey 7 helped him to an 80.
Faldo was one of 23 players who failed to break 80. Both Colin
Montgomerie and Sandy Lyle shot 79s, while Masters winner Jose Maria
Olazabal had a 78. Leading scores (Americans unless stated):
66 -- C Pavin.
67 -- G Sauers.
69 -- P Stewart, L Mize, S Stricker, L Janzen, B Langer (Germany).
70 -- G Norman (Australia), A Magee.
Other scores included: 73 -- D Feherty (N Ireland). 74 -- J Parnevik
(Sweden), I Woosnam (Wales). 75 -- S Ballesteros (Spain). 78 -- J M
Olazabal (Spain). 79 -- C Montgomerie (Scotland), S Lyle (Scotland). 80
-- N Faldo (England).

THE Scottish Chamber Orchestra last night rounded off the first-ever
collaborative series between Scotland's three symphony orchestras, and
the first winter season of concerts to be held in Perth.
Six months ago the question was: will an audience need to be built
from scratch? Yesterday the promoters reported an average attendance
over the first season of almost 65%, which is impressive for starters.
And in the brochure for last night's closing concert, some details of
the second season were unveiled, revealing meaty-looking programmes.
Meat was on the menu in the first half of last night's all-Beethoven
programme in which the SCO was directed by its chief conductor Ivor
Bolton. The Coriolanus Overture was as taut as a steel cable; even its
quiet moments were characterised by a stealthy tension.
Nothing stealthy about Stephen Kovacevich in the First Piano Concerto.
This was heavyweight stuff: big, power-driven, bruising piano playing
(and some delicacy to balance in the slow movement). Gripping, though an
epic first movement solo cadenza threatened to go on so long that the
band could have nipped out for a pint.
The Pastoral Symphony in the second half was more workaday, though
some of Ivor Bolton's speeds were so hair-raising that it felt like
cornering on two wheels. Some superb playing, however, in the lean,
bracing first movement, a whirling Scherzo, and -- best of all -- in the
luminous intensity of string playing at the peak of the finale. Same
show tonight in Aberdeen and Saturday in Edinburgh.

AT the World Telemark championship in Norway, the British team faded
after solid first-run performances in yesterday's giant slalom.
Mark Blyth skied to seventeenth in the first heat, but was reduced to
twenty-fifth place after collecting a seven-second penalty for not
landing a jump in a Telemark position and using two Alpine turns in the
second heat.
Kerr Blyth fell at the bottom of his first run and failed to complete
a promising heat.
In the women's event, Lesley Beck fell twice and finished in thirtieth
place. Results:
Giant Slalom: Men -- 1, T Thun (Norway) 3min 6.6sec; 2, P Schintler
(Norway) 3-11-22; 3, L Clement (Canada) 3-12-85; 25, M Blyth (Scotland)
3-19-09. Women -- 1, A Enberget (Norway) 2-53-83; 30, L Beck  4-21-35;

WELSHMAN Mark Mouland reaped the dividends of a fresh attitude to golf
with a five-under-par 67 in the first round of the Turespana Balearic
Open in Majorca yesterday.
''I've become a lot more dedicated -- I don't think there's any other
way to survive these days,'' said the 33-year-old former World Cup
player, whose last victory was seven years ago.
''There are so many youngsters on the European Tour now who go to the
gym, don't drink, and go to bed early. It might be boring, but they are
getting the job done.
''I think everybody has cut down on the alcohol as a result. I'm not
saying I've stopped enjoying myself, but it's in moderation. I'm
practising harder and I feel more happy with myself.''
Mouland, who finished the day tied for the lead with Spaniard Pedro
Linhart, last year had his worst season on tour since 1984, dropping to
115th in the Order of Merit.
''It was the second time in four years that I nearly lost my card,''
stated the Kenilworth-based player. ''I had no confidence whatsoever.
Now, though, the goal is to win again.''
Mouland played the back nine first and turned at one under par. It
looked like being level par when he went into the lake at the short
eighteenth but he salvaged a bogey with a 15-foot putt. He then
collected four birdies in an inward 32.
Linhart, 32, made a 15-footer on the sixteenth, struck two drivers to
the fringe of the green at the next, and closed with a No.6 iron to six
feet.
Defending champion Barry Lane lies only one shot further back, while
Mark James and Adam Hunter, from Glasgow, winners of the last two
events, both returned 73s. Paisley's Stephen McAllister is top Scot on
71. Leading scores (British or Irish unless stated):
67 -- M Mouland, P Linhart (Spain).
68 -- G Emerson, S Ames (Trinidad), J Rozadilla (Spain).
69 -- F Lindgren (Sweden).
70 -- J Van de Velde (France), S Richardson, A Bossert (Switzerland),
P Golding, J Sandelin (Sweden), D Smyth, R McFarlane, C Larrain
(Venezuela), S Watson.
71 -- I Pyman, C Rocca (Italy), B Lane, J Rivero (Spain), P McGinley,
S McAllister, M Litton, P Affleck.
Other scores included: 73 -- A Hunter, M James. 74 -- A Coltart. 75 --
W Guy. 76 -- R Drummond, A Oldcorn. 78 -- C Ronald, P Lawrie. 79 -- D
Robertson. 82 -- B Marchbank (withdrawn). 84 -- G Orr. Disqualified: C
Cassells.
* WITH holder Craig Watson unable to play because of work, a new
winner of the Ken Murray Memorial Trophy is assured at Greenock tomorrow
when the competition is played in conjunction with the club's
twenty-fifth annual charity tri-am to be contested by a Scottish Amateur
Select, a President's Select, and a club team.

A NEW measure of inflation, RPIY, which excludes indirect taxes and
mortgages, was given a mixed reception yesterday.
There is speculation that it will be used as the basis for a fresh
inflation target expected to be announced by the Government later this
year.
The Bank of England has been publishing RPIY data in its quarterly
inflation report for some time. The Government responded to pressure
from City economists to publish the figures monthly along with the
Central Statistical Office's Retail Price Index and underlying inflation
(RPIX), which only excludes mortgages.
There were no shocks in the February figures. The headline rate edged
up from 3.3% in January to 3.4% last month after the retail price index,
still the basis for pay bargaining, rose by 0.6% to 146.9.
The underlying rate edged down from 2.8% to 2.7%, still in the upper
half of the Government's 1% to 4% target range. The RPIY rate also eased
from 1.9% to 1.8%.
The Institute of Directors welcomed the introduction of RPIY as a more
accurate instrument for measuring trends and gauging the need for
changes in interest rate policy.
''The additional information provided by RPIY will enable true
comparison to be made between self-inflicted inflation induced by tax
increases, excise duty and mortgage interest payments and the genuine
increases in prices,'' said director-general Tim Melville Ross.
''Increases in the overall cost of living will continue to be shown in
the traditional Retail Price Index.''
Currently headline and underlying inflation rates are being boosted by
January's excise duty increases which replaced the second tranche of VAT
on domestic power, originally planned to take effect next month.
The Bank of England has made no secret of its dislike of RPIX as the
basis for the Government's target, but some economists are critical of
the selective nature of its favoured RPIY measure.
The fact that the new measure is around 1% lower than the underlying
rate aroused scepticism. Figures published by the Central Statistical
Office show that RPIY inflation has been lower than the RPIX rate since
December 1993, but this has not always been the case. In 1993, RPIY
inflation was higher in six months out of 12.
BZW's Robert Barrie said the new measure, which excludes council tax,
VAT, excise duties, vehicle excise duty, car purchase tax, insurance and
airport tax as well as mortgage interest payments, ''consists of a set
of prices consumers don't actually pay for a basket of goods they don't
actually buy''.
Morgan Grenfell's Ciaran Barr said: ''You can't just strip out
everything that is going up. Things like excise duties feed through into
the prices people pay and then into wage bargaining.''
Mortgage rates went up last month as a delayed follow-up to the
December increase in base rates and this accounted for the headline rate
rising against the trend of the other inflation measures. Building
societies have not yet adjusted their rates to take account of the base
rate rise on February 2.
Household goods prices rose by 1.4% in February following the end of
the January sales. Retail sales figures show this to be the strongest
area of growth, and there is some concern that retailers in this area
are making price increases stick.
Clothing and footwear prices rose by 1.2% last month, but this year's
bounce-back from the January sales was less than last year's, and price
inflation since February last year is still negative.

ACCELERATING decline of the doorstep pinta market and the corner shop
has forced Northern Foods into a massive rationalisation of its
operations. A further 2200 employees will be made redundant during the
next two years, in addition to 1250 already announced.
The staff cuts are split about equally between the two sides of the
group, dairy and prepared foods, where demand has been hit by the rising
market share of the supermarkets at the expense of the milkmen and
corner shop.
Total cost of the exercise is put at #91m, with a cash content of
#50m. Northern yesterday said its balance sheet is strong enough to take
this on the chin and it is not expected to change much over the next
year
Northern has decided not to cut dividends. Shareholders will receive a
same-again total of 8.8p after a final of 5.3p in respect of the year
which ends this month. This is in spite of a predicted fall in profits
for 1994/95 from #157m to #118m befor exceptionals.
Chairman Chris Haskins explained that dividends were being held
because the cuts were a one-off event, the group had strong cash flow,
dividend cover was good and capital spending would be on a falling
trend.
The decline in the doorstep delivery market has been in progress for
years but has accelerated dramatically in the past 18 months and is
falling at an annual rate of 12%-13%. Northern sees doorstep deliveries
declining from 45% of the total milk market to 30% before stabilising
there.
Part of the market's problems are blamed on the Milk Marque, the
successor to the Milk Marketing Board, which Northern considers to be a
disaster. Milk Marque is a monopoly supplier to a market where supply is
limited by European Union Common Agricultural Policy quotas. It
estimates the resulting higher cost of milk has raised its costs by #45m
a year. The industry has appealed to the Office of Fair Trading and the
Brussels competition authorities.
Northern is the largest supplier of prepared foods to Marks &amp; Spencer
but also supplies corner shops with deliveries of milk products like Ski
yogourt and meat products like pies and sausages. This market has been
drastically hit by the power of the supermarkets and is being cut back,
with one factory to close altogether.
Mr Haskins is hopeful that milk rounds can be rationalised in a fair
way so that each roundsman has his own territory and senseless
competition is avoided. The group's own milkmen are franchised but there
is a a high turnover of franchisees so cuts are not expected to impose
too much hardship.
The group supplies milk to supermarkets in Scotland from dairies in
England and has no doorstep sales here.
The dairy restructuring involves reducing bottling capacity by 40% and
cutting the number of distribution depots. In prepared foods delivery
networks will be heavily pruned the Pork Frams and Bowyers delivery
operations merged. A factory will also be closed.
The cuts will produce savings of #20m in 1995/96 and #37m a year when
fully implemented. But Northern warns that these will only be partially
reflected in profits because margins will remain under pressure. It does
expect to be able to pursue a ''progressive dividend policy.''
Yesterday's news was not entirely unexpected and Northern shares
slipped just 8p to 197p.

MANWEB, the regional electricity company (REC) that serves Merseyside,
Greater Manchester, and North Wales, is reviewing its electrical
retailing activities. It is holding talks with ScottishPower which may
be interested in acquiring Manweb's five superstores.
These stores are in Liverpool, Southport, St Helens, Chester and
Warrington. The company also owns 58 High Street stores and employs a
total of 600 staff in its retail division. No agreements have been
signed and talks are continuing and are expected to last a further
two-three weeks.
Last year, Manweb's retail business made a profit of #600,000 on sales
of #28.3.m. In the first six months of the current financial year, the
retail division made a small loss but is expected to return to profit by
the year-end.
In contrast to many in the sector, ScottishPower is doing well in its
retail business, helped by a mixture of customer loyalty, good High
Street locations and revamping of its retail offer. Last year, before
the full benefits of acquisition of the Clydesdale stores had fed
through, ScottishPower's retail business made a profit of #7.4m on sales
of #114m.
It acquired 36 Clydesdale superstores in the Midlands and northern
England for #16.9m. Any Manweb superstores acquired would be
complementary to Scotishpower's existing retail network. ScottishPower
is looking to expand its retail activities both organically and through
acquisitions. It is already one of the major electrical retailers in the
UK.
Electrical retailing in the UK is a notoriously competitive market
with overcapacity and sluggish consumer spending putting downward
pressure on margins. The Rumbelows chain has recently closed down the
Kingfisher retail group is currently in the process of restructuring its
Comet electrical retail business. Despite being number two in the market
to Dixons it has been caught out by changing customer demands and
cut-throat price competition.

Bill Amos finds that things are shaping up in the boat market.
AFTER a long period in the doldrums because of the recession, boat
sales are picking up again, and the number of different craft on offer
-- both new and used -- is nothing short of bewildering.
In terms of variety and the range available, boats are in some ways
like motor cars, except in one very important aspect. Unlike cars, good
boats don't depreciate sharply immediately you start using them.
In fact there is evidence that they actually appeciate and may,
therefore, be considered as a fair investment. A 40-foot Jeanneau Sun
Fizz was sold new in 1982 for #39,000. Two owners and 12[1/2] years
later it was sold, for #42,500. A Westerly Konsort, sold new in 1986 for
#34,500, has been resold for #38,000. Similar appeciation values could
not be applied to a 10-year-old BMW, nor even a Rolls Royce.
Although there are excellent establishments in Glasgow where craft can
be inspected in the comfort of a showroom many buyers prefer to look at
boats in their natural environment -- afloat at one of the marinas. At
Largs, Inverkip and Troon yacht havens, a wide range is available for
inspection.
It is probably true that the emphasis is placed on sailing boats, but
there is growing interest in power-driven types which have the advantage
of speed. Many would-be sailors simply do not realise that the range of
a sailing boat on weekend trips is fairly limited. A fast cruiser-racer
would be hard pressed to average seven or eight knots under sail, except
in a gale when many people would prefer not to be at sea.
A good power cruiser capable of averaging 25 knots (say 28mph) in
reasonable weather would be able to go much further on day or weekend
trips -- and get home in time.
One thing I do not quite understand is why, size for size, power boats
should cost appreciably more than sailboats. For example an attractive
sailing cruiser, the Odyssey 28.1, with an 18hp diesel auxiliary sells
for #35,000 including VAT. But the robust Seawings 277 motor cruiser,
virtually the same size but fitted with a 200hp Volvo turbo-charged
diesel, costs #75,000. I know that big turbo-diesel engines cost a lot
of money, but I never imagined installation would cost #40,000.
The Seawings, however, will cruise at 25 knots, with a maximum of 30
knots flat out, burning quite a lot of duty-free juice costing about #1
a gallon at Marina prices -- although marine diesel fuel can be bought
much cheaper at fishing ports such as Tarbert.
The fuel consumption of fast power boats can be alarming. The worst
offenders are the petrol powered sportsboats used for water ski-ing with
a big outboard which may demand seven or eight gallons an hour, or more.
There is no concession on petrol used for marine purposes, only the
diesel fuel used in bigger inboard-engined craft is tax free. But a 28
to 30ft diesel motor cruiser may still cost #10 an hour to run if
operated at near full throttle.
GRP -- glass reinforced plastics -- is the most popular material used
in boatbuilding today, although boats are still built in a variety of
other materials such as wpod, steel, aluminium and even reinforced
concrete.
It has to be said that although GRP allows yachts and power craft to
be built on a series-production basis it is not the ''miracle'' material
it was once cracked up to be. It is strong and can be moulded into
beautiful shapes and, unless a colour change is required, normally does
not need painting -- certainly not every year, like wood or steel. It
will also last a lifetime.
But it can suffer from a condition known as osmosis described
colloquially in the trade as ''the pox''. This fault shows itself
beneath the waterline as clusters of water-filled blisters and if not
correctly diagnosed and dealt with by professionals can eventually cause
serious damage.
It is possible to cure osmosis but its potential existence accentuates
the need for a survey when buying used GRP craft.

The man who coined the term dub poetry in the late seventies is to
perform his angry, wise, and pithy brand of it live in Scotland for the
first time, writes David Belcher
LINTON KWESI JOHNSON has mixed memories of his last visit to Scotland.
''I was in Edinburgh, reading poetry at the festival. Things were going
well, and a man came up and asked me if I was Linton Kwesi Johnson, and
I said I was . . . so he handed me a summons. I ended up laying out four
grand in legal fees.''
Aye, there's always a cost attached to having principles. The
principle in this case was Linton's right to have pulled out of a gig in
Nottingham which was being picketed by racists. The promoters sued him.
So when you turn up at Glasgow's Renfrew Ferry on Thursday evening to
pay homage to LKJ, you will be helping erase a stain from one man's
perceptions of Scotland. More importantly, you'll be getting a bargain.
The man who coined the term dub poetry in the late seventies will be
performing his angry, wise, and pithy brand of it live in Scotland for
the first time, accompanied by the mighty Dennis Bovell Dub Band, and
supported by an extensive roster of reggae-flavoured artists from his
own LKJ record label, including performance poet Binta Breeze.
As well as opening next weekend's second Scottish Radical, Black and
Third World Bookfair, Linton's Glasgow gig is a date on the first UK
tour he has undertaken during the nineties. Indeed, he last played live
with a band in Britain in 1992, in Brixton at an ANC benefit.
Not that Linton Kwesi Johnson has been idle, as I discovered when I
met him earlier this week in the LKJ offices, two rooms crammed with
boxed piles of CDs above a recording studio in a sedate part of Brixton.
After our conversation, it was Linton's task to deliver the CDs to
record shops.
''Dennis Bovell and I have constantly been on the road. In Latin
America. Japan. All over Europe. Festivals in France, Switzerland,
Belgium, Denmark. People forget that Britain provides a tiny proportion
of the world market, and I'm not an artist who feels he has to keep a
public profile here by releasing an album every six months.''
Indeed, Linton Kwesi Johnson's performing career in music and poetry
has had its periods of complete silence. ''I retired from music and
touring between 1985 and 1988. I worked in TV, for Bandung File, and I
was also working as arts editor with the Race Today collective. I was
also part of a black parents' organisation here in Brixton, and they
told me that I wasn't spending enough time with them, and so I increased
my commitment.''
Similarly, Linton's most recent LKJ album, Tings an Times, is a
five-year-old re-release, issued in tandem with the paperback version of
Tings an Times, Bloodaxe Books' compilation of work from the three
poetry collections Linton has penned since 1974.
Yet there's plenty of new stuff on the LKJ label. Albums by Dennis
Bovell and Shake Keane. Solo albums by seasoned guitarist John Kpiaye
(Aswad, Eddie Grant, Janet Kay) and equally-seasoned sax-man Steve
Gregory (Rolling Stones, Fleetwood Mac, Alan Price), both of whom will
be in Glasgow.
''After we had released Michael Smith's Me Cyaan Believe It in 1981,
the label went dormant until we had the idea to create what we call, for
the want of a less pretentious phrase, thinking man's reggae, using good
music-oriented or music-based poetry. We've also become involved in
making instrumental reggae albums. There's a tradition of them, but no
new ones seemed to have been made for a while.''
How healthy, or how unthinking is mainsteam reggae today?
''Reggae is very healthy. From Chile to Iceland it's an international
form just the same as rock. There's a tendency to minimalism, a basic
pulse, which is OK for DJs and rappers. But we felt there was room for
music with proper instruments, and players and singers.''
How does the latest high-speed musical hybrid, jungle, fit into the
reggae canon?
''I'm the last person to ask about jungle . . . I'm in my early
forties, I'm no expert. But it's an extension of dancehall, and it lends
itself to dancing . . . and it's a reflection of a revolution in
technology in that its extreme tempo and its poly-rhythms seem to mirror
a sense of dislocation in the lives of young black people.
''They are suffering a lack of stability and cohesion . . . 60% of
black people under the age of 24 are unemployed -- and jungle is a way
of letting off steam.''
We won't be getting an LKJ jungle single then?
''No! Can you imagine me on Top Of The Pops?''
I study LKJ's hornrimmed spectacles, trilby, and fawn slacks, his
sand-coloured V-neck woolly worn under a grey sports jacket fashioned
from a mix of tweed and cardboard . . . heck, why not?
''If the current album gets in the charts, OK . . . but everyday life
is hard enough without trying to live up to some myth of LKJ . . .''
The myth of LKJ?
''You get articles saying you're a prophet or a spokesman of your
generation . . . and apparently you have to live up to this. I wouldn't
mind a million sales . . . but I'm happiest to have created a little
niche for myself through poetry and music. To have influenced people in
Jamaica to develop dub poetry.
''My proudest achievement is to have originated the form of dub
poetry, to have established it as a sub-genre of reggae . . . as a
poetic medium.''
Quite rightly so. For what is it that LKJ's Bass Culture says? Muzik
of blood/ black reared/ pain rooted/ heart geared/ all tensed up/ in di
bubble an di bounce/ an di leap and di weight-drop/ it is di beat of di
heart/ this pulsing of blood/ that is a bubblin bass/ a bad bad beat.
Giving a language to folk without a voice: it's priceless.

MANUFACTURING exports continue to be the dominant force behind
economic recovery, according to the Confederation of British Industry's
Monthly Trends Inquiry for March.
Overall demand also continues to be strong, although less so than in
the February survey. More firms still expect to increase prices than to
reduce them over the next four months.
Export orders were at a new record for the second month in a row with
32% of companies stating that in volume terms their export order books
were above normal and 18% saying below normal. The positive balance of
14% is the highest figure since the CBI first asked this question in
April 1977.
Overall demand saw a positive balance of 11% compared with February's
positive 13%. Apart from last month, this remains the highest figure
since December 1988. Manufacturers still expect output to increase
markedly over the next four months, though the pace of increase is a
little less than expected in February.
So far as price increases are concerned, many companies are still
expecting to push these through over the next four months though the
positive balance of 27% is down on February's 31% and, indeed, has
declined throughout the first quarter.
Suhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director for economic analysis,
said: ''The outlook for inflation is a little more encouraging than
earlier in the year, with a slightly lower balance of manufacturers now
expecting to raise domestic prices.''
However, he cautioned: ''But we cannot be certain that this signals a
definite change from the inflation outlook of recent surveys. Companies
are still facing tough competitive conditions in the home and export
market.
''Next month's CBI Quarterly Industrial Trends Survey should give a
clearer indication of the prospects for factory gate prices.''
In its economic assessment accompanying the survey, the CBI concludes
that the outlook for growth in consumer spending has become more
uncertain -- at least in the short term.
Consumers will experience a reduction in their spending power in
April. And there is little to suggest that they are sufficiently
'bullish' to run down their savings significantly -- especially when the
value of their traditional 'stores' of wealth -- housing -- remain
vulnerable.
However, consumer spending seems likely to be supported over the
coming months by rising incomes as employment prospects improve.
In the meantime, overall economic growth will be helped by UK
exporters taking advantage of the further growth in key overseas
markets, suggesting that the CBI's forecast of just over 3% GDP growth
remains on track.

WHEN the Barnet family began its long tradition in the furniture
trade, many of the stylish designs the present-day company sells as
''reproduction'' -- classic pieces by Adam, Hepplewhite, and Sheraton --
were not even antique.
''The family has been in the furniture trade for five, possibly six
generations -- we don't know for sure,'' said Mr Ronald Barnet, owner of
Barnet Reproductions in Glasgow.
Mr Barnet began selling reproduction furniture -- quality replicas of
older ''period'' styles -- upholstery and carpets from a shop in the
city's Woodlands Road. But in the early 80s he sold up, before returning
to the business about eight or nine years ago.
''We started in Saltoun Street and we were there for a couple of
years, just to see how it would go. Then we moved to our present
premises -- 1291 Dumbarton Road, Whiteinch, a former Baptist church.''
Walking into the maze of showrooms -- there are over 10,000 sq ft --
is like stepping on to the set of Upstairs Downstairs or the Forsyte
Saga. The various rooms are jam-packed with elegant mahogany and yew
furniture to grace any home. The classic designs range from the golden
age of cabinet-making in the eighteenth century through to the fine and
elegant Regency period and the darker, ornate designs of Victorian
times.
There are a variety of size, style, and shape of dining tables and
chairs -- from double rail to cross stick and Queen Anne to Prince of
Wales -- from the budget to the superior range.
There are sideboards from 3ft to 6ft wide and a superb selection of
yew dining room and occasional furniture; wall units with diamond
cut/bevelled glass doors, mirror backs, and concealed lighting; library
bookcases, display cabinets, double bow-fronted china cabinets, the
highly popular inlaid corner cabinets, executive desks and leather
swivel and tilt chairs, filing cabinets and, although never designed as
such, work stations and computer desks.
There are bureaux, bureaux/bookcases, video library storage cabinets,
various size and shape TV/video cabinets, hi-fi/speaker cabinets,
serpentine chests and numerous nests of tables. Leather and hides with
gold tooling are used on some occasional pieces and desks.
Two showrooms are devoted to bedroom furniture, one featuring the Fort
Knox solidity of the American Treasury range, with its imposing bed and
matching chests and cabinets which feature ornate brass handles; the
other displaying the chateau chic of the Ducal range -- four-poster bed
(#2050, including mattress, drapes, and bedspread), wardrobe and rug-boy
cabinet -- which is available in various finishes.
As well as a whole range of reproduction furniture, there are
pictures, ornate mirrors, some etched and embellished, in every size and
shape; table lamps, overhead lights, vases, ornaments, figurines, busts,
urns, umbrella spills, in short, an Aladdin's cave.
Barnet Reproductions has exported furniture to Canada, Saudi Arabia,
and Norway and has customers all over Britain.
''Londoners find they can get a better deal from us than from some of
the top-name Kensington stores,'' said Mr Barnet who went on to quote
several examples to underline his company's price competitiveness -- and
that was before deducting the additional 20% currently available.
Mr Barnet, who looks after the administration and researches, started
buying direct from the manufacturers recently, cutting out the middle
men. He receives container-loads of furniture from the Far East every
three to four months and hopes to increase deliveries to every four to
six weeks by the end of this year.
He is helped by his son Alan, who looks after the day-to-day
management. There are 18 employees, including two polishers who prepare
some of the furniture in the company's workshop. Roughly two-thirds of
the furniture is bought unpolished. Half of it is finished in-house
using specially prepared polishes, the other half under contract in
London.
Mr Barnet's father, David, manufactured furniture at 614 Argyle
Street, a block or two away from The Buttery, and had a showoom in West
Regent Street and later at several addresses in Woodlands Road. His
grandfather, John, was a wholesale antique dealer, and his great
grandfather was also called John, or Archibald. ''When I was young I
wasn't interested in the family history. Now I'm interested,'' said Mr
Barnet. ''I just regret I didn't do more about it at the time. What I'm
intending to do is to go to the Mitchell Library and several other
places where you can look back and see how far back the business went.''
Mr Barnet does know that over the years the family business occupied
premises in West George Street, 137 West Regent Street, Oswald Street
and Woodlands Road.
''The furniture they sold was practically the same as ours --
reproduction. When I was young, people bought walnut, oak and mahogany.
Now it is swinging round to yew and mahogany. The young people want
something light and different. They were maybe brought up with nearly
all the other trends we have had -- all sorts of modern styles that
don't seem to have remained popoular. Then we had teak, black ash, and
numerous other ones. They have all died. Some catch on more than others
but the traditional styles have gone on and on.
''Unfortunately the price of yew more than doubled last year so how
long its popularity will keep going, I don't know.''
However, Mr Barnet is sure people will prefer to pay a little more to
get yew than have some substitute.
Despite the price hike, furniture is still far more affordable than in
the past. ''When I was young it was nearly all built for businessmen and
professional people -- doctors, dentists, and lawyers. You didn't get
teachers coming in because they were too badly paid so it was a very
much smaller market then.''
Now reproduction furniture is big business and a visit to Barnet's
showrooms holds attractions for all the family.
For Dad there are the hi-fi cabinets and captain's chairs; the
children will be fascinated by the Giant's Chair and the miniature
upholstered Victorian chair (#155); and Mum will find the Chippendales
simply irresistible.

<HEADLINE>Scottish soft fruit growers in major marketing exercise</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>979239088</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LEADING soft fruit growers in Scotland are to mount a major marketing
exercise in response to indications from some of the United Kingdom's
major retailers that they would like to buy more fresh strawberries and
raspberries from north of the Border.
The fragmented nature of the soft fruit industry had been an obstacle
in the past to meeting the demands of the supermarket chains who want
large volume backed up by reliability of supplies.
One result may be the sight of fields being sheltered from the rain so
that harvesting can continue uninterrupted by bad weather.
Under the auspices of the Scotish Agricultural Organisation Society,
Scotland's farm co-operative organisation, 11 local groupings of growers
have come together to devise a common strategy.
''The need for closer co-ordination within the industry in Scotland
has now been acknowledged by all working group members,'' said Mr James
Graham, projects director of SAOS. ''The challenge from now on,
therefore, is to ensure that we vie with our overseas competitors rather
than with each other.''
Tesco, Sainsbury, Safeway and Marks &amp; Spencer have all been
interviewed on the future for Scottish soft fruit and have given
indications of ''excellent market opportunities'' and a desire to buy
more produce from Scotland.
The later harvesting date for Scottish strawberries, coming after the
end of the main English season, is seen as an important advantage,
particularly with the Scottish crop being renowned for its excellent
taste at that time of the year.
Unreliability of supply is a major problem, however, and growers will
be asked to consider adopting the practice of erecting shelter over
areas about to be harvested so that rain does not interfere with the
fruit-picking.
The Scottish raspberry is recognised as an excellent product but the
bulk of the harvest goes for processing. Part of the new marketing
effort would be designed to increase supermarket sales of fresh fruit.
''Some of the multiples would be interested in putting on special
promotions for Scottish fruit if we could guarantee sufficient volume
and reliability of supply,'' said Mr Graham.
''We must move quickly to improve our links with retailers,'' said Mr
Andrew Logan, a director of the Dundee-based marketing group Scotfruit
and a member of the study working group.
''It is clear there are many growers around the world who would like
to move into our marketplace and some are already working hard to do
just that.
''The onus is on us to respond to the retailers' enthusiasm for the
Scottish product by developing good long-term trading relationships
which are capable of sustaining a steady growth in sales,'' he added.

DANISH writer Astrid Saalbach's Morning &amp; Evening, part of Hampstead's
women's season, is a light but scrupulously-woven piece carrying heavy
symbolism and a stark warning of global annihilation in the sound of a
rising wind which threatens to engulf a group of evening diners in
Robert Jones's town-garden setting.
But Saalbach's piece is interesting not for the general but the
particular. She is sensitive but ruthless in exposing Danish
middle-class life -- marriage, family, nice dinner parties -- tartly
undermining all that with an ironic edge that shows up the petty
cruelties, lies, and insecurities lurking within material complacency.
Even when it appears at its most stable, our grasp on life is tenuous,
Saalbach seems to be saying. It is also short if the number of strange
illnesses the characters are prey to (environmentally induced?) is
anything to go by. Structured like a symphonietta -- some scenes are
even named intermezzos -- Saalbach's tapestry of encounters gives us
snapshots of apparently diverse couples subtly linked by coincidence and
chance happenings: the garden of the last scene turns out to be a
facsimile of one painted on canvas by a young artist in an earlier one.
Even when we are unaware of it, Saalbach suggests, we are interconnected
and one step from the abyss.
Director John Dove is best at bringing out the play's jauntiness
rather than its rising hysteria and gets smart treatment from such sound
talents as Selina Cadell, Jonathan Cullen, Polly Adams and Reece
Dinsdale.

FIFE College Theatre Arts students have kick-started the recently
acquired Pathhead Hall back into life with a twice-a-day promenade
adaptation of J R R Tolkien's celebrated underworld fantasy.
With cheeky disregard for the crisp, classical dimensions of the
building, the production is a free-flowing procession of large-cast
scenes taking place all over the big square hall, only towards the end
making use of the traditional head-on stage. In this it is a more
dynamic, better controlled example of stand-up-and-follow-the-action
theatre than any of the several professional promenade productions seen
recently in Scotland. For the school-aged audience it is pitched at, it
makes for a lively and inspiring introduction to the imaginative
possibilities of theatre.
There is a marvellous contribution too from the props department
(designer Grant Thomson and puppet maker Richard Penny), but the
extensive use of full-face masks does lead to a muffled quality to the
delivery which, coupled with a lack of clarity in the story-telling,
makes it hard to keep track of what's going on.
In the end, one narrow escape from a band of elves seems much like the
next narrow escape from a band of goblins and, although the young
audience was attentive throughout, each scene could do with being more
clearly established, each moment of conflict more clearly motivated, if
the production is to find the dramatic momentum to become a gripping
epic journey, as well as the elaborate spectacle it undoubtedly is.

Ur ye dancin'? Ur ye askin'? Ay, Mayfest's askin'. Glasgow -- yur
dancin'! MARY BRENNAN previews Mayfest
PASS me those sequinned adjectives quick -- Mayfest dance is going
strictly ballroom! The news that quickens the step towards the box
office is that Donnie Burns and Gaynor Fairweather are taking to the
floor (at the Shed, the former Harland and Wolff building on the Clyde
at Govan) with Andy Ross, his orchestra and full chorus playing: Carmina
Burana. Shimmy your mind round that prospect.
I suppose, in a way, it's a ballroom equivalent of Torvill and Dean
ice dancing to Bolero. In anyone's terms, it's an intriguing
combination, and one that Mayfest's director, Paul Bassett, reckons is
well in keeping with the mood of the times, and the tastes of the city.
Glasgow has always been keen on the dancin' . . . For hundreds of
couples it wasn't just a turn round the floor on a Saturday, it was a
sashay into dreamland -- with the added possibility of finding a partner
for life. When Bassett and his team started thinking about the dance
element in Mayfest, they kept bumping into different strands of the same
enthusiasm. Veleta or disco, foxtrot, samba or jive, Glasgow was on its
feet and regularly stompin' at the nearest club or ballroom.
It became too obvious to overlook. Slowly ideas began to take shape.
Quick-quick, phone calls were made. Faster than you could say Victor
Silvester, a programme came together: a series of events celebrating the
social side of dance in Glasgow. Donnie and Gaynor -- 11 times reigning
World Latin Dance Champions -- agreed to come dancing in Mayfest. Yes,
there was a project they'd been mulling over. It involved performing to
Carl Orff's Carmina Burana. Bassett still grins with delight as he
recounts this. It was almost as if fate was giving a thumbs up to his
schemes.
Donnie and Gaynor in the Shed . . . an all-day Discorama competition
at the SECC . . . tea dances in Govan, Shettleston, and City Halls . . .
a VE-night at the Plaza. Ur ye dancin'? Ur ye askin'? Ay, Mayfest's
askin'. Glasgow -- yur dancin'!
Those who merely want to watch do get a look in, of sorts. Yvette
Boszik has, in recent years, been a hot ticket on the Edinburgh Festival
Fringe. Her last show, The Countess -- inspired by vampire mythology,
but cunningly filtered through modern psychology -- is a thrillingly
sensual gothic enigma. As Bassett says, it's the kind of performance
that, having seen it yourself, you want others to share the pleasure
too. There are only three performances -- book early, book often is my
advice.
The Abhinaya Tarpan Dance Company also dip into mythology for their
performance -- they are staging a dance-drama based on The Ramayana,
using both folk and classical Indian dance styles, traditional music and
costumes.
In a way, it's a programme that side-steps the usual inter-festival
in-fighting to secure the new, the odd, the superstars and the
crowd-pleasers (although Donnie and Gaynor's Coming Home scoops all
those categories). Bassett questions just who benefits from such
exercises in programming one-upmanship: audiences or programmers' egos?
Bassett sees a need to free Mayfest from the kind of template that
descends on festivals after they've been going for a few years. Contexts
change, and nowhere more so than in post-1990 Glasgow. He acknowledges
that Mayfest was a crucial point of entry for certain kinds of work, and
new dance by small, foreign troupes was an example of this. Now New
Moves Across Europe is happening at Tramway, tangible proof that Mayfest
can afford to look at the local agenda, the home product, because other
organisations have a strong handle on other scenes.
Tramway itself is bringing in Mayfest displays of alternative European
hoopla with German circuses and has looked to Sweden to secure another
Lepage production, his exquisite staging of Strindberg's Dream Play,
performed in a cube suspended above water and only to be seen in
Glasgow.
At the Centre for Contemporary Art, they have their own Mayfest feast
of live art. The Handsome Foundation make a welcome return with further
performances of Legend, a trip over rainbows that even Judy didn't know
existed, and there's a cluster of raw, confrontational talent with
Robert Pacitti, Sarbjit Samra, and Ronald Fraser Munro all showing their
recent work.
Munro is also involved as narrator in the event that ends Mayfest --
NVA's large-scale outdoor experience, Stormy Waters. On a site by the
Clyde, three bands -- Underworld, Blackdog, and Autechra -- will help
drive a cast of hundreds through the saga of Glasgow's transition from
industrial past to a future-world of technical realities. Hold that
thesaurus. Drop those inadequate adjectives -- only one word describes
this lot: Mayfest.
Full details of Mayfest can be found in the festival brochure, which
will be distributed free with The Herald on Monday.

<HEADLINE>Dairy operation to shed 60 jobs.  Scottish Pride spends #3m on restructuring</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Pride, the leading dairy operation in Scotland with 40% of
the milk market, yesterday announced 60 redundancies and a #3m
investment programme designed to secure the company's future as a major
player on the dairy scene. They do everything from doorstep deliveries
to supplying major supermarkets, plus cheese and butter production.
The investment programme and the jobs cuts will be phased in over the
next 12 months. A company spokesman said that they would try to achieve
the reduction in the labour force in ''the most acceptable way
possible'' but they could not rule out the possibility of enforced
redundancies. The current workforce totals about 900.
News of the developments at Scottish Pride came on the same day as
Northern Dairies, in England, announced job cuts of more than 2000
following the announcement of a 25% drop in profits last September.
The changes at Scottish Pride will include the closure of fresh milk
depots at Annan, Dalbeattie, Dumfries and Silloth, to be replaced by a
new depot located in Carlisle. Fresh milk operations formerly handled at
Kirkcudbright will also be transferred to Carlise but Kirkcudbright will
become the centre for Scottish pride's UHT production, taking on some
work transferred from the Govan plant.
A new depot is also planned for Aberdeen to handle sales of the
company's Fresh 'N' Lo semi-skimmed-milk brand leader to north-east
supermarkets. That work had previously been contracted out to Wiseman
dairies.
The Paisley depot will amalgamate with the Rutherglen operation and
Irvine will become the centre for work previously carried out in local
depots at Ayr, Troon and Saltcoats. At Mauchline, in Ayrshire, new
cheese packaging facilities will be introduced, meeting the most
stringent supermarket standards.
Much of the company's investment will be centred on its principal
production plant at Govan where new equipment is being installed to
allow the company to re-commence its own butter production.
Butter-making facilities were lost with the closure of the Galloway
Creamery in Stranraer last year and production of their flagship
Scottish Pride brand has been contracted out since then.
The planned redundancies will include dairy workers and office staff.
Accounting, tele-sales and sales order processing will be increasingly
concentrated on the Govan head office. That will mean the closure of a
London-based unit servicing the catering trade in London -- with the
loss of nine jobs --and a slimming down of staff based at the cheese
production units at Campbeltown, Bute and Arran.
Mr Jim Hosea, chief executive of Scottish Pride, said that they had
now been operating as a commercial company for about five months, having
previously been the trading arm of the old Scottish Milk Marketing
Board.
''In a truly competitive market, ever-greater efficiency is in the
best interests of the company and its customers, he said. ''The growth
in sales and profitablility which we all seek will, I am confident, be
brought closer by these moves. We are anxious to let the people affected
by these plans know as soon as possible, although some of our plans for
reorganisation are some way down the line.''
Mr Sam Harty, Glasgow district secretary of the T&amp;G (Scotland), said
that he hoped it would be possible to work with the management to
achieve the maximum redeployment of staff, avoiding the need for
compulsory redundancies wherever possible.
He welcomed the opening of the Aberdeen depot and the investment
programme outlined by the company. ''We have an interest in seeing that
the company remains in the market,'' he said.

THE Buchanan Street retail development in the centre of Glasgow is on
plan, according to joint partner Slough Estates chairman Sir Nigel
Mobbs.
The 600,000 sq ft project will ''definitely'' have John Lewis as the
anchor tenant. He added that the details of the financing are now being
worked out with its Pearl Assurance partner.
Slough, Britain's second-largest industrial property company, acquired
the interest in the site from its then 48.5%-owned Bredero Properties
associate which collapsed last year after having lost #106m in 1992
because of provisions on its Centre West development in London.
Pre-tax profits last year rose 21% to #64m helped by an 8% increase in
net rental income. The increase in net asset value of only 7p to 276p
per share disappointed the City which had been hoping for up to 290p and
the shares slid 10p to 220p where they stand at a 20% discount compared
with the sector's 17%.
The dividend total has been held at 8.1p with a 5p final for a 4.6%
yield.

TWO Edinburgh-managed investment trusts have lost more than one-fifth
of their net worth in the six months to the end of February as Far
Eastern stocks markets have plunged.
Net asset value of the #263m Edinburgh Dragon Trust fell by 20.6% to
99.67p.
Even worse was the news from the #66m Baillie Gifford Japan where net
asset value declined by 22.3% to 596.3p.
Edinburgh Dragon, which invests in the Far East, excluding Japan and
Australia, said the results reflected the sharp correction experienced
by Asian stock markets last year after their strong performance in 1993.
Baillie Gifford said the flow of news from Japan, with the Barings
shock quickly following the Kobe earthquake, was ''almost unremittingly
bad.''
The Topix index was down 17.2% and the TSE Second Section 27.4% in
sterling terms.
The yen has appreciated sharply since the end of February and 40% of
the assets are hedged against sterling.

<TEXT>
COATBRIDGE-based Magnum Power, floated on the Unlisted Securities
Market last August, is raising another #2.4m through a share placing.
The cash will be used to expand the innovative company's sales and
engineering resources, in response to greater-than-expected interest in
its revolutionary built-in uninterruptible power supply.
Magnum's product, patented in Los Angeles and brought to Scotland by
managing director Vincent Lavin, provides back-up power for electronic
equipment, in the event of loss or malfunction of the mains supply.
With software run on personal computers becoming ever more
sophisticated, it is becoming increasingly important to protect the
power supply.
Magnum's product is being seriously evaluated by more than 30 major
computer manufacturers, mainly in the US. Discussions with several of
them are at an advanced stage.
A leading US retailer could also use Magnum's protective power box in
its electronic point of sale terminals.
Magnum, which has conditionally placed 2,038,340 ordinary shares at
118p through Manchester-based broker Henry Cooke, Lumsden, announced it
was on course to break-even in December, as predicted last July.
Magnum Power, with a market capitalisation of #50m, grew out of Magnum
Power Solutions, which was formed in 1990 after Mr Lavin returned from
the US.

WHAT is going to happen at Guinness -- and how is it going to create
future growth when whisky is in decline in several of its traditional
major markets? Those were the questions being asked in the City
yesterday after the drinks company produced 1994 profits in line with
expectations at #915m, up 5%, boosted the dividend total by 8% and
hinted, because it is so strongly cash generative (#460m last year), it
may buy back some of its shares.
The almost tangible sense of relief that nothing untoward had happened
was sufficient to send the shares jumping 16[1/2]p to 438p.
A 9p final dividend raises the total to 13.8p for a 3.9% yield.
United Distillers produced apparenty flat profits at #700m (#701m) but
the latest figures have been flattered by a #29m exchange gain while the
1993 result was affected by a #20m charge to cover European
reorganisation.
The #30m loss of profit in Venezuela was well posted at the half-way
stage and while Guinness group volumes were not significantly affected,
it has been a process of imports being reduced in that country and
locally produced spirits filling the gap.
Happily, group exposure to Mexico is only 1% compared with the Allied
Domecq 5%.
In the home market, the boost given to Bell's 8 Year Old cost about
#11m but the reformulation and relaunching of the brand were successful,
helped by a strong Christmas and a #2 discount when buying two bottles.
Chairman Tony Greener said there was 4% growth in the Christmas
quarter and it appears to have continued at about that rate to give the
brand 18.4% of the total UK market, about 6% ahead of Famous Grouse and
virtually double that of Teacher's.
The pressure continues to be in the supermarkets from own-label brands
something which has also continued to affect Gordon's which lost share.
United Distillers will strongly promote the gin brand in 1995 and may
even restore its alcoholic strength from 37.5% to 40% as a sign of
product integrity and quality.
Also in the UK, brewing profits were affected by a heavy spend on
promoting Guinness so that profits overall were down #22m at #99m or
just 10% of the operating total.
Elsewhere in brewing, there was slight recovery at Cruzcampo in Spain
where Guinness must be regretting its #550m investment -- it returned
pre-interest profits of just #23m and with little relief in sight given
the sickly Spanish economy and political turmoil. Overall brewing
profits rose 8% to #256m with Malaysia particularly good and a #12m
contribution from the Desnoes &amp; Geddes acquisition in Jamaica.
Guinness Worldwide Brewing will always be a worthy contributor and
highly dependable overall, but providing little significant earnings
growth. So that leaves newly apppointed United chief executive Finn
Johnsson to provide the momentum.
It was somewhat chilling to learn that Mr Greener acknowledge that
Dewar's had been a ''neglected '' brand in the US during the last 10
years and only now is being revitalised. One can only wonder what has
been happening in the marketing division.
The 34%-owned Moet Hennessey business brought in #89m compared with
the #125m the previous year from the then quarter-owned LVMH luxury
goods group. Cognac profits were almost flat but champagne profits rose
8% on higher sales and lower grape costs.
The decision taken early last year to concentrate on prime brands and
build them up at the expense of the secondary and tertiary products
makes sense -- even if does restrict consumer choice. This coincides
with the disposal of low margin brands as with yesterday's outline
agreement to sell $240m (#150m) of sales of the United Distillers
Glenmore subsidiary in the US for about #110m to Barton Incorporated, a
subsidiary of Canandaigua Wine Company of the US.
However, it does appear that the US hard liquor market is in terminal
decline while Japan's golden era of high profitability for quality
spirits is almost certainly at an end. Mr Greener said consumer prices
were completely out of touch with the rest of the world but that spirit
volumes should make good in due course.
So the challenge is to get the North American, Japanese, and UK
markets moving again. Price consciousness at home in particular will
have to be met by heavy brand imaging.
Overall group spirit margins amounted to 26% with those in the
emerging markets about 31%. They accounted for 6% of case sales and 10%
of profits and will provide whatever bounce there will be in the short
term -- say the next 18 months.
Guinness will struggle hard to reach #1000m in 1995 to leave the
shares trading at 12.9 times possible earnings and seem unlikely to
outperform apart from the occasional flurries caused by the share
buy-back potential.

YOU published two letters which fail to understand what the Loch
Lomond and the Trossachs Working Party recommended and the substantial
action the Government is taking in response (March 22).
In our response we made it quite clear that we fully endorsed the
recommendations of the working party and were ready to assist in putting
them into effect. We agree with the working party that the area should
be managed by a joint committee of three local authorities, to be
responsible for the area from April, 1996.
Until those authorities exist we are providing #200,000 extra support
to the Loch Lomond Park Authority and will work with the existing and
new authorities to set up the new body. It would have been foolish and
wasteful to set up such a committee before local authority
reorganisation and then have to remodel it once the shape of the new
authorities was known. That is why now is the right time to act.
We have moved quickly and significant action has already been taken.
We recognised the need to have by-laws in place to enable sensible
management of activities on the loch and we have amended the law to
remove the difficulties which the local authorities were experiencing in
making by-laws.
Stirling and Dumbarton have made by-laws and every effort is being
made to ensure that they are in place for the summer season. By-laws are
no use without a method of enforcement, so Scottish Natural Heritage is
working with the park authority to set up a water-borne ranger service
costing #345,000 over three years.
Lady Glasgow was reported on March 15 as criticising the Government
for setting aside the working party recommendation for a joint committee
with planning powers. In fact, this is precisely what we have accepted.
It is for the local authorities to decide what powers they wish to
delegate to the committee but we have urged that they should delegate
planning powers for the area.
If the new local authorities take up with enthusiasm the initiative we
are offering then we should be happy to consider an application from
them for incorporation of their joint committee as a joint board.
We have, through Scottish Natural Heritage, made available substantial
financial support amounting to almost #3m over three years, to ensure
that the issues highlighted in the report are addressed. That sum does
not take into account whatever the local authorities themselves care to
put into the management of their areas.
John Foster's comparison with English national parks omits that
important element. Nor do I agree that the pressures on Loch Lomond and
the Trossachs are anything like those being experienced in the national
parks which serve large English conurbations.
The case for or against national parks in Scotland is not clear-cut:
there is no consensus one way or the other. The Countryside Commission
for Scotland, in its 1992 report, The Mountain Areas of Scotland, said
that the English model of national park required refinement for Scottish
needs; this is supported by John Foster.
I believe that the arrangements that we are putting in place for the
Cairngorms and Loch Lomond and the Trossachs are indeed designed for
Scottish needs and will secure the future of these areas for
generations. It is now time for those who claim an interest in the area
to get together and use the substantial resources we have made available
for the benefit of these areas through the partnership approach
advocated by the working party.

Minister for the Environment,
Scottish Office.

IN Scotland's Homes (March 16) the change from imperial measure to
metric in area measurement is reviewed with some misgivings about the
competence of people to understand.
We may not be even at the stage of imperial measure. This house was
built in 1985 and when the associated legal documents came through, the
area of land was given in square acres. I had to consult The Pocket
Scots Dictionary to learn that 1 sq ac = 6100 sq yds = 1.26 ac.
This is not the only example of poor numeracy extant. In the past week
or so we have been constantly reminded by hospital spokesmen, and even
the Health Minister herself, that medical resources are finite. No news
there. Everything in the world is finite, so why should health resources
be different?
Finite need not mean inadequate. Fresh water in the West of Scotland
is a finite resource but we have it in abundance. Our electricity
generating capacity is finite but it has met its maximum demand without
power cuts for over 20 years.
So medical resources are naturally limited. The desirable number of
transplant organs is zero, which it would have been had donors not died
prematurely, but the word finite was not applied to these. Rather it was
applied to artificial resources created by people.
Restricted would be a better word than finite because it does not
disguise the part played by people in the choice and balance of
resources.

I AM one of many women who wish to congratulate you upon your
excellent coverage on the issue of breast cancer. The combination of
personal accounts, informative articles, and useful addresses is a good
source of help and comfort.
If only such information could adorn more hospital noticeboards in the
city of Glasgow. This might be useful in the Victoria Infirmary where
the first available date for surgery (classified as ''immediate'') is
May 24.
Apologies from administrative staff and overworked doctors cannot
bring forward my sister's appointment -- although a poor prognosis from
the pathology results on a melanoma elsewhere on her body possibly
might.
And so a young woman waits and worries, safe in the knowledge that
only if malignancy is found elsewhere will the hospital initiate an
earlier date for breast surgery. Another player in the great NHS
lottery. She deserves better -- we all do.

IN view of the high level of dental decay in Scotland your report that
the establishment of the new Scottish water authorities will reopen the
possibility of fluoridation of public water supplies is welcome news
(March 17).
Fluoridation is frequently described as mass medication although this
measure is not a form of medical treatment but a preventive nutritional
measure designed to minimise dental decay in the whole population.
Fluoridation can properly be described as a supplementation of the
supply of an essential element which happens to be deficient in the
local water supply.
In principle, it is not really possible to distinguish fluoridation as
a public-health measure from the other measures which are now generally
accepted as necessary to ensure that water is potable and possesses a
desirable composition, such as chlorination, adjustment of hardness, and
filtration.
All these measures are concerned with the provision of drinking water
which will have such a composition that no ill effects will arise on
public health from its use.
Those who are successful in blocking fluoridation of public water
supplies by playing on the fears of the public may feel that they are
standing for some principle, but what they are really doing is to
condemn whole communities to a quite unnecessarily low level of dental
health in the long term.
In view of the real environmental hazards to which most of us are now
exposed (and these certainly could include the industrial contamination
of the environment with fluoride), it is sad that so many of these
should be ignored while vigorous and ill-informed attacks are focused on
a remarkably successful public-health measure.

WITHIN the seminar on smoking sponsored by Action on Smoking and
Health (ASH) it was reported that among youngsters under 16 some 842
million cigarettes a year are being consumed, raising #80m in revenue.
These figures sound horrendous and are unquestionably regrettable.
Smoking is an adult social pursuit and should stay that way, with the
tobacco industry fully supporting sensible measures to discourage the
under-16s from starting to smoke.
However, one thing which smoking does cause is statistics, which in
some circumstances can give a skewed perspective. The numbers actually
represent considerably less than 1% of the total market for tobacco.
Now although any percentage of under-age smoking is obviously a cause
for concern, and there should be no complacency about it, a smoking
percentage on this scale cannot in truth be termed or represented as any
kind of pandemic.
Unfortunately single-issue pressure groups like ASH find it
irresistible to dance up storms -- and so spoil their case and their
credibility by quoting statistics with no qualification.

ACQUISITIVE textiles group William Baird pleased the market with its
1994 results and upbeat comments about the outlook.
The company, which has been disposing of its engineering activities
while addding to its core textiles and clothing, has seen profits before
tax increase 28.4% from #19.6m to #25.1m.
At the operating level, profit was #27.2m with the contribution from
the textile business increasing by 22.3% to #25.2m.
Turnover from the continuing textile operations advanced by 10.2% to
#520.3m, an underlying 4.3% after adjusting for the effect of
acquisitions and other changes.
A final dividend of 5.80p lifts the total by 5.1% to 9.35p covered by
earnings per share up 35.8% to 14.8p. The package boosted Baird's share
price 12p to 212p.
Chairman Donald Parr yesterday said that concentration on the
development of core textile and clothing interests has generated an
encouraging profit increase particularly in contract clothing. And funds
released by the withdrawal from engineering, now virtually complete,
have been re-invested in key areas within the group's strategic
framework for growth in the UK and in Continental Europe.
There is litle doubt that this strategy is proving successful so far.
The management will continue to focus on improving the operating
performance of existing businesses and on the successful integration of
the recent Cohen and Melka-Tenson acquisitions. This is expected to
bring progressive benefits through the current year.
Indeed, the company said it remains in a strong position to achieve
further strategic and financial progress in the year ahead though the
rate of progress will depend, in part, on the general economic
environment. The caveat is well understood. But the general sentiment is
satisfyingly bullish.
Conditions in textiles, though, did remain difficult in both the UK
and continental European markets last year with the former showing a
gradual underlying improvement.
Baird said margins continued to be influenced by competition and
increases in raw material price although the effect of the latter was,
to a certain extent, mitigated by forward commitments.
The company designs, manufactures, and markets a wide range of brand
and contract clothing for many major UK retailers and has seen
encouraging growth in business with Marks &amp; Spencer.
The shares have been unexciting for some time but bould be in for a
re-rating if progress continues.

EDINBURGH-registered North Sea Assets is set to be taken over by
US-based Dresser Industries, a major force in the oil and gas services
sector, writes IAN McCONNELL.
The board of North Sea Assets yesterday recommended acceptance of a
34p per share cash offer for the company, which announced it was in
takeover talks less than two weeks ago.
Dresser's offer values North Sea Assets, whose head office is in
London, at about #18.7m.
Undertakings to accept the offer relating to 32.1% of North Sea
Assets' issued share capital have already been received.
North Sea Assets yesterday reported 1994 pre-tax profits of #279,000,
compared with #1.95m in its previous financial year.
When North Sea Assets announced a 64% drop in half-way, pre-tax
profits to #432,000 last year, it said that, like others in the same
business, it was suffering much tougher trading conditions.
Last September, North Sea Assets announced the #6m cash sale of
offshore construction subsidiary Hydra-Lok, one of its most profitable
operations, to Hunting Group.
It also put loss-making marine equipment subsidiary Huntly Equipment
Rental into a joint venture with Aberdeen-based Balmoral Marine, taking
a 20% stake in the enlarged company.

STERLING pulled itself higher in quiet European trading as the mark
gave up some of its earlier gains. The pound ignored UK inflation data
which was largely in line with City estimates.
It rose almost a pfennig to DM2.2394 and gained two-thirds of a cent
against the dollar at $1.5930. Its trade weighted index gained 0.1 to
85.2.
However, it is expected to head lower with the next support at
DM2.2170. The market has been bearish on sterling in recent months
partly on the back of fears of rising inflation which were borne out in
yesterday's figures.
''Sterling may get a bit of a lift as the interest rate expectations
come back,'' said George Magnus, international economist at S G Warburg.
The underlying strength of the German mark means that any rise in the
pound will be limited.
Political and economic turmoil in several of the major European
countries will continue to leave investors little option but to invest
in marks, a dealer said.

IT may come as a surprise to some but the infant formula industry
would agree with much of Joan McFadden's article (Mother's brew is
drafting support, March 16) on a more positive attitude towards
breastfeeding. However, her comments relating to the promotion of baby
milks in hospitals cannot go uncorrected.
Infant formula manufacturers do not openly promote their products in
maternity units by providing free samples ready for use in handy sterile
bottles. Baby milk companies have never supplied free samples of
ready-to-feed formula and discontinued supplying free samples of
powdered formula in 1989.
Under the new Infant Formula Regulations which came into force on
March 1, 1995, free supplies are permitted but manufacturers will
maintain their own stricter rules by continuing to ban free samples.
Ready-to-feed products in bottles can only be obtained through normal
NHS procurement procedures and they are purchased by hospitals for those
mothers who bottle-feed.
The industry cannot be held responsible for what happens when health
professionals distribute these products but, quite clearly, the
statement that ''baby milk companies have and will continue to have a
field day'' in promoting their products is incorrect.

AS a final-year student at Queen Margaret College, Edinburgh, I was
horrified and disgusted to read the comments made during the
professorial address by our Principal, Donald Leach (March 21).
I find the argument that students should be forced to pay towards the
cost of their courses extraordinary coming from a man who only a few
years ago stood for election as a Labour candidate in the local council
elections.
I would suggest, if Professor Leach continues to propose that
universities and colleges move '' . . . further from their ivory tower
and into the market place,'' that he himself should be seen to implement
the strategies of such a market and act as a salesman to encourage
students instead of increasing the barriers to higher education.
I would also advise Professor Leach to remove himself from his
personal ivory tower within the college and open his eyes and mind to
the reality of student life in the 1990s.
Reports of student hardship are commonplace and I object to Professor
Leach's inference that students of this college whose course fees are
paid lack the commitment and drive to succeed in their chosen field.
If anything it is the constraints placed on students by limited
finances and the need to find paid work (and a friendly bank manager) to
supplement their grants that prevents increasing success rates.
It would therefore seem obvious that any future increase in the
financial burden borne by students will limit rather than expand the
numbers wishing to enter high education.

THE possibility of fraud within the TSB Group emerged yesterday at the
bank's annual general meeting in Glasgow.
Following up allegations by London businessman Michael Gross, TSB
spent #675,000 last year on investigations headed by leading London law
firm Linklaters &amp; Paine.
TSB chairman Sir Nicholas Goodison said a similar sum was likely to be
spent in the current year. The group has brought the matter, which
relates to its Hill Samuel subsidiary, to the attention of the Bank of
England as regulator.
Hill Samuel is the third merchant bank to hit the headlines in the
last three months. The latest revelations follow the breakdown of SG
Warburg's merger talks with Morgan Stanley of the US in December and the
spectacular collapse of Barings last month.
Sir Nicholas told shareholders: ''There is a possibility of fraud but
I would not be able to say from this platform that there has definitely
been fraud against this group.
''I can only say it is a possibility and we will do everything to
ensure that it is investigated by the proper authorities.''
Sir Nicholas said the losses which were the subject of the
investigation were not material in the context of the group and had been
fully provided for.
Refraining from giving precise details of the continuing inquiry, Sir
Nicholas added: ''We frankly don't know whether there is a fraud lurking
here.''
He attributed the substantial cost of the investigation to its very
wide nature and the fact that many of Mr Gross's allegations went back
many years.
TSB director of communications Locksley Ryan confirmed after the
meeting that the matters still under investigation related to Hill
Samuel and to the period after its takeover by TSB in 1987.
However, there was no indication of whether past or present employees
were involved.
Mr Gross's connection with Hill Samuel stems from the fact that it had
a 25% stake in his company, Gross Hill Properties, until 1992.
Before the eventful meeting, members of the Banking, Insurance and
Finance Union released 200 balloons outside the Moat House International
Hotel, protesting against TSB's plans to close 200 branches this year.
Numerous shareholders joined the union in voicing concerns over the
cuts in the branch network during the meeting.
Executive share options also attracted the ire of some shareholders,
with directors accused of having their ''snouts in the trough''.
Mr Gross also objected to the amount paid to Hill Samuel chief
executive Hugh Freedberg, who, on #595,501, was the highest paid
director in the year to October 31.
However, Sir Nicholas said Mr Freedberg had done a great job in
refocusing Hill Samuel for the future.
Touching on the intense competition in the industry, Sir Nicholas said
there were far too many banks, building societies and now retailers
competing for the same business.
However, he was confident that TSB's strategy, coupled with the
strength and quality of its management, would allow it to succeed.
Justifying the branch closures, Sir Nicholas said: ''The process of
carefully judged amalgamation and closure must continue if we are to
have the resources to provide a first-rate service to customers, while
providing shareholders with rewards for risking their capital in the
business.''
Although he confirmed afterwards that there was no substance in
takeover rumours surrounding the bank in January, Sir Nicholas told
shareholders: ''I haven't the slightest idea whether we are going to be
taken over.''
However, he believed any potentially hostile bidder would be deterred
by the 15% limit on individual shareholdings contained in TSB's Articles
of Association.
While TSB itself remains interested in buying a building society, Sir
Nicholas did not envisage an opportunity arising in the near to
medium-term.
In the year to October 31, TSB raised profits by two-thirds to a
record #504m, largely because of a reduction in bad debt provisions.

Saying it with flowers is traditional on Mother's Day, but do you get
value for money? Anvar Khan, with the help of four florists, asked some
mothers what they thought about their floral gifts
THE four florists selected to take part in this article, from both the
capital city of Edinburgh and the cultural township of Glasgow, received
only one stipulation from The Herald. Namely that each mum should
receive flowers suitable as a Mother's Day gift.
The artistic direction of the bouquet was entirely up to the designer,
just as long as the ingredients and delivery charge didn't cost more
than #25 a time. The mission was to find out what product, exactly, one
can expect from a high street florist for this sum. As it turns out, it
wasn't that much of a challenge for the retailers in question. Women
love flowers. All flowers. Even the very many which featured in their
bouquets that they couldn't name.
The mothers who generously donated their time, sense of smell, and
living space to huge amounts of flora were found through various
avenues. Friends, colleagues, the boyfriend. Their names were, more
often than not, suggested by married sons feeling guilty for neglecting
them, for not phoning or calling round, or daughters content in the
knowledge that mum would simply enjoy the surprise of sharing her house
for a while with the prettiest of plants.
Mother's Day is, however, a time when all mums are at their
matriarchal best, when they expect a little something, a card or a gift,
for their trouble. It is a brave man or woman who defies this
celebration. Today, The Herald presents the results of an intense and
comprehensive survey into the impact of flowers on the ultimate and
collective authority of motherhood.
FLORIST: William Williamson of Edinburgh, Gyle Centre (0131-538 5555).
* MRS Catherine Sloan is 65. She plays darts for a local team, loves
her grandchildren and knitting but not necessarily in that order.
''I've got the bouquet in my bedroom because it's cool there. They're
up at the window, and I've got the curtains wide open so everyone at the
Scottish Office across the road can see them. They are absolutely
gorgeous. I put a new spool in my camera and I've been taking photos of
them.
''I've still got the flowers in the wrapping. It's peach, pink, green,
orange, rust with big pink bows and ribbons on fluted paper. There are
pink and peach carnations, orchids, daisies and really beautiful, green,
long-stemmed leaves, like sheaves of grass.
''The bouquet is really huge, the size of my dressing table. I had to
put the flowers in a big dish I used as a plant pot. The first night
they toppled over. They must have been top-heavy, not enough fluid at
the bottom. Being honest, it's the nicest bouquet I've ever seen in my
life. I even phoned up the florists and told them they were the most
gorgeous flowers I'd ever seen.
''I trimmed the bottoms yesterday. They'll last another fortnight. If
I wanted to send flowers to anyone I'd go to William Williamsons's and
use my Eurocard to get them done.
''I would have thought they were the most expensive in the shop. They
are out of this world and the smell! My son doesn't have to feel guilty
now. They are definitely value for money at #25. I'd give them 10 out of
10.''
FLORIST: George Wilson of Edinburgh (0131-667 5572).
* MRS Kathleen Reilly is in the Salvation Army. She'll be 75 in July.
''I wasn't in when the bouquet arrived so they left them with my
neighbour. She's just got a new great grandson and she wished she could
have taken them to the hospital. It's a big bouquet like you see on Play
Your Cards Right. I really thought they were lovely.
''There's quite a mixture of flowers; carnations, three cream ones,
the rest are pink. There are three roses, irises, daisies, and some kind
of other flower, a lovely colour, but I don't know what you'd call them.
They're speckled inside with four or five stamen. Are they lilies?
''One rose has gone brown, but I like the wee white snowballs mixed
in, they're quite nice.
''They are definitely worth the money. I give them full marks out of
10. There's a lot. I had to borrow a vase from next door, I didn't have
one big enough.''
FLORIST: Sandy Martin's Branching Out, Hyndland, Glasgow (0141-334
8666).
* MRS Mary McRobert, 47, is an auxiliary at Gartnavel General
Hospital. She's just completed a year's course as a clinical
aromatherapist.
''The lilies came out today. The florist gave me a list of all the
names, but I couldn't recognise all of them. There are trachylium,
statice (flowers you can dry), gerbera, lilies, catharmus, septembriana,
spray chrysanths and tulips.
''This bouquet is really nice because it's unusual, it's a wee bit
different, usually you get carnations. There's a thistle-like one which
opens up to a wee orange flower. There's one on a long stem like a daisy
and it bends over because the head's so full, but the rest are erect.
The heat usually kills flowers but mine are still standing.
''It's lasted well, I've had them nearly a week, and there are plenty,
some of which are still in bud. You'll be very hard to please if you're
not pleased with these flowers. My daughter Anne got me with my bouquet
on video the other day so that my other daughter, Pauline could see me
with them. ''
FLORIST: Joseph Riley of Glasgow (0141-632 2484).
* MRS Winifred Jarvie, 47, is a lab ancillary worker at the Southern
General and a Bingo enthusiast.
''My first reaction was ''Oh what a beautiful arrangement!'' The
presentation is absolutely fabulous. I'm delighted. I can smell them as
I come in from work.
''There's fancy-cut paper over the edges which comes up over the
bouquet, with a satin cloth ribbon in the same colour scheme as the
flowers, from dark purple to light pink.
''I've still got them sitting in the wrapping. I put the bouquet in a
planter to keep them balanced and I've moved them over to the window to
keep them away from the radiator.
''The ferns and greenery are beautiful. The mini-daisies are slightly
past their best. But the pale orchids, and the deep purple carnations,
are very, very attractive. My son said ''Oh they're lovely''. It looks
something.
''Everyone who comes in -- and I had a lot of people in the house at
the weekend -- are all so impressed. My brother-in-law from Falkirk and
I were wondering ''What do you think they cost?'' I'd say about #30 to
#40.
''I can't fault them in any way, 10 out of 10. I think any mother
would be over the moon to receive them.''

I WAS greatly impressed by your coverage of the case of Iain Hay
Gordon in Weekender on March 11.
I was the barrister who in 1958 prepared the detailed report on the
case. As the BBC programme recently broadcast in Northern Ireland
illustrated, I was closely involved from 1958 onwards in a personal
capacity on behalf of Mr Gordon.
The programme correctly summarised a confidential meeting which I
attended at Stormont with the Minister of Home Affairs. As I explained
in the programme, this meeting led to the quiet release of Iain Gordon
from Holywell Mental Hospital, County Antrim.
I remain convinced that Iain Gordon has been the victim of a
miscarriage of justice initiated by the outrageous interviewing
techniques of a Scotland Yard police officer.
Iain Gordon was neither guilty, nor was he insane. I would be prepared
to co-operate fully with any inquiry established to look into all this
and, I must add, such an inquiry is now long overdue.
It is wholly unacceptable that Mr Gordon should continue to bear any
guilt in this matter whatsoever.
I trust that the public in Scotland will soon be able to view for
themselves the excellent two-part programme recently released by BBC
Northern Ireland.

IT is suggested that up to 50 firms of solicitors are involved in
defrauding Legal Aid claims. Will anyone take a bet that nothing will be
done bar the odd scapegoat?
Legal Aid in this country has no requirement for applicants to show
they have made any attempt to resolve the dispute. Solicitors perpetuate
this situation.
Being awarded Legal Aid produces a blackmail situation where the Legal
Aid holder has nothing to lose and the non-recipient can, even with
large claims, end up worse off after costs. Who gains? Solicitors.
We recently had the likes of Gerry Adams and the Maxwell brothers
getting aid.
I would suggest that the Legal Aid system brings this on itself.
And the Law Society protects lawyers. Mr Kenneth Ross's criticism of
the Legal Aid Board is refreshing but he should remember it is his
members who are doing the cheating.
Suggesting that unparalleled consumer protection is supplied by the
Law Society and its compulsory insurance would not stand up to checking.
Mr Iain McIntyre's protest and comments hit the nail on the head. His
former lawyers may end up getting a ''letter of regret'' from the Law
Society at worst.

EQUALITY for everyone? Are you aware that British seamen, working on
British-flag ships, 80 miles off the coast of Scotland or England,
paying the same rate of income tax, National Insurance, and council tax
as every other British citizen, can be dumped out of their jobs on only
three days notice?
Being seamen, they are second-class citizens and not entitled to the
same rights as other tax-paying citizens, even though they have worked
for the same employer for 20 years.

THE dramatic job losses announced by Northern Foods, the largest milk
processor in the UK, are the result of several pressures. The company's
head thinks the most important of these was last year's replacement of
the Milk Marketing Board with Milk Marque, a farmers' co-operative. This
effectively deregulated the British milk industry which had been
controlled by the board for 60 years. The change was expected to bring
in cheaper milk prices (and that may still result later this year), but
in many cases the reverse has occurred and fears originally expressed by
the likes of Northern Foods have proved to be correct. Northern is not
the only company to have felt the impact on its profits for Unigate,
also big in the milk business, has been badly hit as well. The Scottish
experience has been different -- more competition has emerged here --
but traditional sellers of milk and milk products in England have been
very badly hit, which is why Mr Haskins of Northern Foods was justified
in insisting that the deregulation was ''botched.''
It comes also at a time when milk sales have been altering
significantly in a way which is bound to be at the expense of
traditional suppliers. Less than a decade ago nearly two-thirds of milk
sales were direct deliveries in bottles to doorsteps. By now that figure
has fallen below half of all sales, is expected to be less than a third
by 1997 and, at most, a quarter by the end of the century. This is a
powerful trend which mirrors the inexorable rise of supermarket shopping
where the bottle has disappeared and the product is sold in relative
bulk (most cheaply in four-pint plastic containers). Supermarket milk is
certainly cheaper than the old ''pinta'' and is kept cheaper still by
the present round of price ''wars'' which may have had some retailers
selling milk at less than cost, as a loss leader. This trend may be
deplored -- and many may well come to regret the demise of specialist
retail outlets which the triumph of the supermarkets presage -- but that
will not reverse it. It is hard to see what will be; though in some
areas the supermarket approach falters -- they cannot sell fine wines,
for example -- milk is one of these, even if it previously seemed to
offer such thin profit margins that only the specialists could handle it
profitably.
Milk, the product, has not changed in a long time, but collecting,
processing, packaging, and delivering it have all changed in ways
designed to reduce costs and enhance its visual appeal. Costs have
fallen just at the point when the change to Milk Marque has allowed many
producers to increase their own margins. The older specialist retail
companies have found their profits ''milked,'' though it really is no
joke. Yesterday's job losses will almost certainly not be the last.
Though the picture may alter again, depending on how the EU milk quotas
turn out next month, it seems unlikely that a central state organisation
for the dairy industry will ever be reconstituted. The sales trends
noted above will continue but the job losses just announced will reflect
a price which has to be paid to meet for our milk in a trolley rather
than at the door.

IN Scotland there still exist several places where you can do
something which makes you feel divine: stop a train with a wave of your
hand. One of them is Duirinish, a scattered crofting township near the
village of Plockton, on Loch Carron.
Duirinish is a ''request stop'' on the famously fragile Kyle line. It
can't truly be called a station. Beside the track is a shelter like the
canopy on a bus stop, with no concourse, comforts or entertainments
beyond the heart-stopping view of the Applecross mountains. But there,
feeling mighty as Thor with his magic hammer, we signalled our presence
to the Inverness train and it reined itself in for three passengers in
walking boots.
As rail travel goes these days, our journey was a piece of licensed
impertinence. Four minutes later we disembarked (or ''detrained'', as
the guards have learned to say) at Plockton, and in that time we were
hard pushed to find anyone to collect our fares. As we walked down the
hill from Plockton's ''proper'' station we felt mildly euphoric; our
round of the peninsula by foot and rail had gone to plan.
There are no poets left in Government. Sixteen years in office have
scoured every vestige of vision from the Conservative soul. When they
break up the railways they haven't the insight to see what they're
doing. They think they're merely returning a loss-making transport
system to the private sector, but from Plockton to Penzance a common
instinct, a shared emotion, tells us that much, much more is at stake.
Even those who rarely travel by train sense the dreadful, blind
philistinism of a purpose which threatens more than the environment,
more than the economy of rail-dependent communities, more than the
convenience of sentimental tourists.
There is something about trains which connect us with land and
landscape in a way that is almost organic. When you come across a
dismantled railway, even one that has been prettily turned into cycle
track or walkway, have you never felt a kind of ghostly ache -- as if
your own body receives from this man-made ley line some memory of
amputation?
The other day, I stood on a hill above the Tay Valley, somewhere
between Dunkeld and Pitlochry. I looked at the river, which was there
first, making a pass through the hills of Perthshire, shaping the nature
of the valley, bringing people, providing transport. I looked at the
road, which came next, following the same route (now the A9), and then
the railway.
A horn sounded, almost apologetically. A little four-car unit scuttled
up the valley, heading for Inverness, powered by diesel, stripped of
ornament: the weakly, watered-down descendant of the steam locomotive
with its majestic train of carriages. Yet, for all its modesty, it still
made the heart beat faster; something to do with its steady purpose, its
sympathetic scale, the self-imposed constraints of its linear progress
through rocks and trees.
When I was younger I looked at landscape differently. I saw its
features, pleasing or otherwise, and my eye selected the orthodox
attractions: the shapely hill, the broadleaf wood, the handsome river.
Now I look more closely at the human imprints which have made sometimes
subtle, sometimes crude adjustments to the topography, and there is none
more eloquent than the line of a railway.
The track itself is organic, steel and timber, and the steam
locomotive is powered by the earth itself, coal to furnace, with only
the sweat of the miner and the fireman to fuel the transition. All over
the world, almost too late, steam locomotives have been salvaged and
restored. At their last gasp they have been recognised as potent
emblems, as well as valuable relics, of a revolutionary epoch in the
human story, when our perceptions of place and time were changed forever
with the coming of the railways.
The antiques have become tourist trains, priced out of the reach of
most tourists. India has its Palace on Wheels, Russia has its Bolshoi
Express, Europe has its Orient Express. But the great railway journeys
of the world remain, regular routes which cross continents and frontiers
and serve business and leisure travellers alike -- or, in the case of
India's network, ''people visiting relatives'', which is the most common
purpose of rail journeys on the sub-continent.
A few years ago I was one of the people visiting relatives, setting
out from Delhi by train to visit my sister and her family in Allahabad,
which is the state capital of Uttar Pradesh. India in transit is
awesome. Old Delhi railway terminus is a small city of intense domestic
activities, lit by kerosene and charcoal, rich with pungent smells --
chapatis and curry and the vanished smell of railway soot.
I spent a night alone on the Delhi-Howrah Express (the train went all
the way to Calcutta) and it was one of the best of my life. Tucked into
the walnut shell of my sleeper compartment I felt happy and secure --
despite the fact that the carriage was locked at both ends to prevent
the intrusion of dacoits. The pale Gangetic plain slid past beneath the
moon, and in the morning I had breakfast with flocks of marabou storks
and families of camels.
When we reached Allahabad the station platform was again thronged with
''people visiting relatives'', and the faces of my sister and my young
niece floated towards me like pale blossoms on dark water. They were
holding garlands of jasmine and marigold, and the ayah's hands were
clasped in Hindu greeting, and somehow the great fussing train and the
congested station were all part of this most celebratory welcome. It was
memorable beyond any journey's end on offer at airport or driveway.
I travelled by train between Paris and Rome on my honeymoon. When my
daughter was seven I took her across Canada by train. Maybe I exaggerate
the poetry of the railways because they have been routed through some
key experiences in my own life; maybe the huddled masses on the commuter
trains of Network South-East, or even ScotRail, will receive such
romancing with bitter laughter. But even the most disaffected rail
traveller has glimpsed, on television and in the newspapers, the
possibilities which exist elsewhere.
In Northern Europe railway networks are modernising, Motorail services
are expanding to take advantage of the Channel Tunnel. In this country
we have a Government wilfully afflicted with the tunnel vision of its
own ideology.
I've used the Motorail service between Scotland and London, I've never
used the sleeper service on the West Highland line, but I welcome the
voices of the London lobby who have joined the campaign to save it. They
may only use it twice a year to reach their Highland playgrounds, but I
have a hunch that, like me, it's the idea of the sleeper service they
find important: a service which puts you back in touch with the contours
of the land as you sleep through the night, and turns the journey from
megalopolis to semi-wilderness into a dawn epiphany on Loch Linnhe.

IT was something of a typical day on Britain's fragmenting rail
network yesterday. The New Young Driver shunted a load of outrage up the
track and the Grinning Controller told him to take it back. Mr Blair and
Mr Major, that is, who indulged in a rather tense exchange of projected
costs for privatisation in the Commons. In fact, nothing much happened
at all, and that despite the Government's news that 37 companies had
expressed an interest in running privatised rail lines, including
Scotrail which was inexplicably described as a line rather than as a
network. The Government will insist that the interest expressed by the
37 companies is a significant sign that privatisation of the rail system
is popular and that it will be a triumphant success. It is nothing of
the sort, and the Franchise Director, Mr Roger Salmon, should have known
better than to claim that the response of the companies was excellent
news and an indication of significant private-sector interest. Nor was
Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney wise to predict better services when
the first privatised trains start running. In the light of the forecasts
of reduced services, closed stations, truncated timetables and
substantial redundancies in the industry, this was a statement which set
several little hostages to fortune trundling up the line. Nor was he
honest enough to admit that the present failings of the rail system
could have been remedied if it had been properly supported by government
in recent years instead of being whittled down for disposal.
In the daily ups and downs of the rail privatisation affair it is easy
to forget that Mr Salmon and the Government confidently expected a good
deal more than 37 companies to show an interest. It is important also to
remember among all the privatisation hype that an interest is nothing
more than a tentative act. Transforming an interest into a positive bid
is the real trick and we await with fascination the names of those
companies brave enough or daft enough to sink their money into this
ill-conceived morass. The Labour Party will also contest the notion that
nothing much happened yesterday. After all, they produced some
interesting figures which suggested, on the basis of statements from the
Government and from British Rail, that privatisation thus far has cost
#1.25billion. Nearly a year, and a series of stalled timetables, after
the process of privatisation began, we were unaware that anything had
actually been privatised. Labour knows better, citing the sale into
private hands of a ballast quarry in Devon as the first major fruit of
ideological idiocy.
Labour plans an anti-rail privatisation campaign around the country,
targeting Tory marginal seats with details of losses in service which
are likely to occur through privatisation. This is a soft option, for
attacking the Government on rail privatisation is as easy as the
proverbial shooting of fish in barrels. Labour has a harder task and it
should address it at once: that is, to give details on what it would do
in office to deal with the railway mess. The responses thus far have
been unacceptable. Labour is committed to a publicly owned and publicly
accountable system, but beyond that the Walworth Road theorists will not
go. Mr Michael Meacher spread a good deal of confusion yesterday with
his assertion that contracts would have to be honoured. What can he
mean? It is not good enough to say that Labour cannot formulate policy
until it sees what the Government will do. The Government plans, in all
their technicolour silliness, are well enough known and variations in
them can be accommodated. Rail privatisation is a widely detested
business; we require to know how it will be resolved by another
administration.

IT takes one's breath away, my dears, that architects find it
appropriate to speak at all, save for groveling apologies muttered
quietly like children trying to get out of a deserved hiding, but you
practically require artificial respiration when an architect, and indeed
an entire wheen of them, describe anything at all as ''tasteless''.
The Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland claimed the object
of their disapproval was also said to be ''outdated and boring''. The
subject of all this was Mr Happy, the redeveloped tourist symbol for
Glasgow, once European City of Culture and soon to be UK City of
Architecture in 1999. Architects in the post-war years know all about
tasteless and outdated and boring.
Have I got this right: they built structures throughout the world, but
especially Glasgow, which made Nissen huts look Florentian, they
continue to stick up concrete horrors which are visual equivalents of
the substance of an Airdrie councillor's speech to a Catholic junior
secondary school in 1958, they are that old-fashioned, and the
architects' notion of buildings are so boring that the speech itself
would be the Gettysburg address. But the architects are right about Mr
Happy all the same.
Mr Happy was the wrong image even when it worked. For a start it was
stolen anyway. The past few years, after the Glasgow people tried to
resurrect it, it was not only absurdly tasteless, out-of-date, and
boring, it was also being used by all sorts of organisation, including
some of the most illiterate tabloid newspapers with which Britain can
come up. But there is more to it than that.
Mr Happy was actually rubbish really and so was most of all that
campaigning which lots of chaps and chapettes made a right few bob out
of but it came up at perhaps one of the liveliest periods though which
Glasgow has gone through: the year of culture.
I remember it very well. Myself and your own Tom Shields and a lot of
other boys and girls spent a few millenniums producing a magazine called
Culture City. It cost us all a lot of money but I don't think any one of
us involved will ever regret it. It wasn't Mr bloody Happy who had
anything to do with such a splendid Durbar as we had that year: it was
us.
The other week wee Brendan McLaughlin, who owns and runs several pubs
in this city, thought up a nice wee semi-scam -- the Stockwell Festival.
Thus the Scotia, The Victoria, and The Clutha bars were open all week
till one in the morning. And suddenly it seemed like the year of culture
again. Brendan got the late licence and Glasgow got the verve, vigour,
and vivacity again.
Later I took some young friends back for a nightcap to my own house.
Two 22-year-olds, brother and sister actually, permitted me to bestow
hospitality upon them, among a nice wee collection of other nighthawks.
It was Kevin who said it. ''I was 17 when we had the year of culture. It
was great. I thought it was always going to be like this when you were
grown up. And it wasn't. It wasn't at all.''
For Kevin and his sister had experienced that marvellous year when
pubs and restaurants were open till dawn, and for them this meant a lot
of fun, the clubs, and discos. Glasgow was awash with European and North
American journos telling the world how vivacious Glasgow was. You felt
that proud.
Within a few months of the year of culture Glasgow's puritanical
magistrates and city fathers were closing down everything, including
imagination, and that idjit Leslie Sharp had mounted Operation Blade and
the hacks were back describing how Glasgow was still No Mean City.
A lot of people have gone out of business since and the Merchant City
is now devastated. Kids are at risk every time the clubs close at two in
the morning and parents are more worried than ever. The streets are
thronged with anxiety, much of it misplaced. Glasgow has an enormous
drugs-related crime problem despite the actual fact that the city is one
of the safest in Europe let alone Britain.
The excitement of that wonderful year has given way to that comforting
despair which Glasgow's bourgoisie seems to enjoy along with Glasgow's
leftist killjoys, as represented by, in The Year itself, a mob calling
itself Workers City. Like most Trotskyite organisations none of the
members actually worked.
But the year of culture did. Oddly, so did I at the time. Even odder
so did Mr Happy then. It doesn't now and the architects who deplore the
symbol now are right. Glasgow isn't entitled to Mr Happy. Four years on
Glasgow seems to very unHappy indeed. But wee Brendan brought it back
the other week. Easy done really, at that.

Allan Laing reports on a partnership which is breaking new ground in
the cyber zone
SO what happens when you put Steven Spielberg and Bill Gates together
and then add Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen for good measure? Well,
what happens is you make the biggest, most exciting, most terrifying,
thing to hit Hollywood since Technicolor, maybe even since sound itself.
What is certain is that, with this gang of four running the show, the
film, television, and music industries will never be the same again.
A new partnership between the world's most successful moviemaker and
the hottest software manufacturer on Planet Earth could, just possibly,
change the face of the entertainment business. Bill and Steve's
Excellent Adventure -- not to mention the revolution -- starts here.
Boy Wonder Gates's ludicrously-rich Microsoft is to form a joint
venture company with DreamWorks SKG, the giant Hollywood studio set up
last year by Spielberg, Katzenberg, and Geffen. The idea is to produce
interactive multimedia software. And then some.
Essentially, we are talking Compact Disc Read Only Memory (or CD-Rom,
to give it it's more familiar acronym), a format which until now has
been of interest only to spotty-faced kids and men who wear anoraks. A
CD-Rom looks like an ordinary compact disc but, instead of your hi-fi,
you place it in your AppleMac and it delivers more information than
you'd find in 1000 floppy disks.
It is already making serious in-roads into the music industry with
artists like Peter Gabriel, Prince, and even Bob Dylan releasing discs
in this format. The CD-Rom's capacity allows a rock star to include his
entire history on one disc -- and still leave room for tons more.
The announcement of the Gates-Spielberg partnership is currently
boggling many minds in Hollywood. The formation in October of DreamWorks
SKG as a major player in the industry has already given the other big
studios (like Warners, Universal, and Disney) cause for concern. Now,
with the key involvement of Microsoft, that concern could turn to mild
panic. DreamWorks isn't so much jumping on the information highway; it's
planning to monopolise the fast lane.
For several years now experts have been predicting the convergence of
the entertainments and the computer industries. But only now, with this
''dream ticket'' partnership, is it being taken seriously. With Gates's
expertise and Spielberg's creative vision, the new company will make
CD-Rom games, educational toys, computer software for the leisure
market, and interactive stories and films. Much of it will be tied-in to
DreamWorks own movies and television programmes. You've seen Jurassic
Park, now play the dinosaur game.
With the two companies involved pledging a minimum of $50m each, there
are plans to build a state-of-the-art interactive studio in Los Angeles
and a separate software production facility near Microsoft's Seattle
headquarters.
Equally important to the venture's success, however, is the impact
that computer graphics will make on film production. Katzenberg was the
whiz-kid who rejuvenated the Disney Organisation by bringing back the
animation spirit of its founder with successes like Aladdin and The Lion
King. DreamWorks, among other ambitious intentions, wants to continue
this emphasis on cartoon feature films.
Thanks to computer technology, it no longer requires 400 animators to
create a movie frame by frame; the job can be done at a fraction of both
the cost and the time by a much smaller team of graphic artists sitting
in front of a computer screen. There can be little doubt that Bill
Gates's genius will play a part in this.
Computer technology will also be used extensively in DreamWorks' music
offshoot, which is where Geffen, the multi-millionaire and former head
of (at different times in his career) Asylum, Geffen, and MCA Records,
comes in. He is the most astute of record executives, the man who
discovered acts like Jackson Browne, The Eagles, and more recently Guns
'n' Roses and Nirvana. With his eye for talent and Gates's technological
know-how, DreamWork will be a significant force in a recording industry
which, up till now, has been carved up by just a handful of
international conglomerates (companies like Warners, Sony, and
Polygram).
Of course, DreamWorks still has a long way to go. It intends to make
movies, TV programmes, records, computer software, and even toys (''I
want them to drive parents crazy,'' remarked Spielberg in an interview
for the latest edition of Time magazine) but at present it has nothing
to show for itself. The studios, film and recording, have yet to be
built. So too do the manufacturing plants for the toys and the software.
But what it does have is the previous track record of the major players
involved -- and you can't put a price tag on that.
It has been more than enough of a temptation for the big investors.
Financial institutions have been queuing up to throw money -- $2000m at
the last count -- into a venture which they regard as the entertainments
giant for the next century, the prototype multi-media company.
Spielberg, Geffen, and Katzenberg have apparently ploughed in $33m
each from their own bank accounts. This is chicken feed to
multi-millionaires Spielberg and Geffen but to Katzenberg (who has been
a salaried studio employee in the past) it has meant re-mortgaging his
home.
Ever since Spielberg started in the movie industry a quarter of a
century ago, he has wanted to own and operate his own studio. Now it
looks as if his wish is about to come true. He is allowing his own film
company, Amblin, to be swallowed up by DreamWorks. It will invest some
$800m to produce 24 major movies by the turn of the century. Katzenberg,
meanwhile, will run the animation division as well as the television
offshoot which has already completed a deal with the ABC network to
produce a series of new action dramas shows.
Behind this ambitious new organisation is the realisation that, thanks
to modern technology, the entertainments industry is entering a brave
new world and no-one -- not even Spielberg himself -- really knows what
it has in store. The only way to succeed is to make sure you have
complete control of your products, and that you cover all eventualities.
DreamWorks is trying to do exactly that with its Microsoft tie-in.
Between the four of them -- Spielberg, Gates, Katzenberg, and Geffen --
they are probably sharp enough not to miss much out there on the cutting
edge.

reports that the deregulation of the dairy industry is having dire
repercussions for producers as huge job losses are announced
THE doorstep pinta is disappearing. Consumers are paying higher prices
for milk. The dairy industry is in turmoil. Jobs are vanishing as fast
as the milkman on his rounds. So where then are the fruits promised by
the deregulation of the milk industry? It depends who you ask.
Alan Wiseman, who heads a thriving liquid milk processing company with
an annual turnover of #110m, welcomes the abolition last November of the
old Milk Marketing Board. Now his firm can buy milk direct from farmers
instead of having to buy at a set price from the board.
''Yes there are a few casualties around but there has been a
fundamental shake-out. Given time the market will settle down and it
will be good for the consumer and good for the trade,'' he says.
But the price of a pint of milk from Wiseman Dairies has risen by 2p.
Elsewhere in Scotland, a pint has gone up by 3p. How can that be good
news for the consumer?
Mr Wiseman believes the new ''Sons of the Milk Marketing Board'' --
the dairy farmers' co-operatives -- have pushed prices up to
unrealistically high levels. Especially in England where they have a
virtual monopoly on supplies. He thinks, though, prices will fall
eventually.
Others in the industry are not so sure. Nor are they convinced that
the deregulation is a fair, free market.
Dr Donald McQueen of the Scottish Dairy Trade Federation points out
that as soon as the old marketing board disappeared, the trade was
forced to pay 8% more for its milk supplies: ''That has caused a major
shock through the whole industry.''
There are implications for the competitiveness of manufacturers who
use dairy products. Before deregulation, the marketing boards sold milk
to dairy producers at a cheaper price than supplies sold for consumers.
Now producers of dairy products have to pay the same price as that
charged for drinking milk.
And there are other complications. It is not just a question of raw
material cost. Under the old system, the milk marketing boards took all
milk produced by farmers and sold it on: ''It was an orderly, centrally
controlled system. Dairies could get a regular supply of milk as they
required it to meet the market. They could pick up the phone and order
more if necessary. Now they have to cast around, looking for suppliers
if they need more. There is little control over the flow of material day
to day,'' he explains.
Scottish dairy farmers produce just under 1200 million litres of milk
every year. Around of half of that is drinking-milk, the rest goes for
manufacturing production.
The milk marketing boards, which controlled prices, were abolished to
be replaced by farmers' co-operatives and the legislation allowed
farmers, if they wanted, to sell direct to big customers. Around 80% of
UK milk is sold through the co-operatives.
In Scotland there are three main co-operatives, by far biggest of
which is Scottish Milk. South of the Border, Milk Marque was set up. The
English dairy industry claims it is holding customers to ransom and has
asked for it to be referred to the Monopolies Commission.
South of the Border, Milk Marque has entered into annual agreements on
supplies to its customers. In Scotland, Scottish Milk has been
auctioning off milk to the highest bidders.
The UK does not produce enough milk to meet demand. Demand far
outstrips supply so the effect has been to force up milk prices.
This makes it more costly not just on the doorstep but for
manufacturing industry. The increased costs on industry will make them
less competitive against international competitors. It is not hard to
see why companies, like Northern Foods, are squealing.
Chairman Chris Haskins said yesterday there had been growing pressure
on the company from the rise in the price of farm milk since
deregulation. Its new contracts under Milk Marque would increase its
bill by #45m a year.
It suffered too from the fall in sales of milk by corner-shops, which
it supplied, and from the fall in doorstep deliveries.
The Ministry of Agriculture denied deregulation was to blame: ''The
prime factor here is competition from the supermarkets, not
deregulation,'' a spokesman said.
But it is not -- is it ever? -- that simple. Deregulation and the
ensuing price hike have been responsible for the drop in doorstep
deliveries. People will buy at cheaper prices from supermarkets when the
small shops prices go higher. To deny deregulation has been a factor in
Northern Foods difficulties is, therefore, somewhat disingenuous.
Labour's agriculture spokesman, Dr Gavin Strang, claims the
deregulation is pure dogma for which the dairy industry and the consumer
are paying the price. There is no free market in milk, he argues,
because European milk quotas mean farmers have to restrict production:
''Because of the quotas they cannot produce more milk to meet demand. In
a normal free market, prices go up, farmers produce more and the price
drops. We simply don't have a free market in milk.
''So you have this wholly controlled market with quotas, the prices
have risen sharply and this is making our manufacturers less competitive
compared to their European counterparts. Deregulation is pushing up
prices and destroying jobs. For what?'' he asks.
The first immediate victim of deregulation in Scotland was the
Galloway Creamery at Stranraer. It was rescued from collapse earlier
this month after being forced into receivership six months ago, owing
#20m.
The Scottish Milk Marketing Board was its dominant shareholder and
main customer. The company used 17% of the total Scottish milk output,
producing up to 18,000 tonnes of cheddar cheese and other products
annually. Deregulation was blamed for weakening its guaranteed cheese
outlet, which in turn made the banks which bolstered it nervous.
Its bankers were comfortable to allow it to continue with debts
topping #22m -- because the firm's dominant shareholder and main
customer was the milk marketing board. When it disappeared, so did the
banks confidence.
This far it has been the only visible casualty of deregulation but as
Dr McQueen points out, firms in difficulties don't go around advertising
the fact. You only learn of problems when the receivers go in: ''That
said, the intelligence we have is that there are no companies in
Scotland in major difficulties. But then Scotland has never had the same
dependency on manufacturing milk markets as England.''
The problems stoked up by deregulation will be longer term and perhaps
less visible than those which have arisen in England, he believes.
The National Farmers' Union in Scotland takes a more benign view of
deregulation. Like Mr Wiseman, its chief executive Mr Tom Brady believes
the higher prices and turmoil in the industry are short-term: ''What we
are seeing is a shake-out after the abolition of the 60-year-old board.
The price of milk is no longer determined by committee. The
co-operatives now decide, broadly speaking, determining the price by the
market place.
''In the old system, the dairy trade were almost guaranteed to make a
profit because the market prices virtually guaranteed it.
''Since deregulation they do realise things can change. At the moment
everyone is scrambling to get milk from producers. That might not be the
position always.''
In other words the market will decide. But will it? Is a free market
which is fettered by quotas free at all? It all depends who you ask.

YOU don't get a lot of promises in local elections. Councils are too
constrained by outside forces in what they can spend for parties to
dangle responsibly many new goodies in front of voters. It's a case of
forming a judgment on who is most committed, within the bounds of what
is attainable, to the best possible services for all of the people.
This is what made the Scottish Nationalists' manifesto offer at the
last regional elections so audacious and quite effective. It could not
have been more specific. ''Vote for us,'' they said, ''and we will give
every pensioner and Income Support claimant #10 towards his or her
heating costs.''
The lessons of Wandsworth and Westminster had been well learned. Hard
cash buys votes. A gift that was tantalisingly subtitled ''One week's
free fuel'' was understandably attractive to some potential recipients,
and helped win the SNP power in Grampian and Tayside. The only problem
with this remarkable offer was its illegality.
The Nats, locally and nationally, did not discover this little
difficulty at some later date, just as they were about to start doling
out the crisp tenners. They were told it all along. In Tayside, some of
their candidates declined to carry the manifesto promise in individual
literature, because they knew it to be worthless.
There is only one essential fact which matters thereafter. It is that
the commitment was not delivered because it was incapable of delivery.
There has been much bluster about alternatives which were then devised
and discarded. At one point in Tayside there was the low farce of the
party of constitutional upheaval solemnly deciding to distribute light
bulbs. This, too, was abandoned.
Tayside has in fact ended up with a scheme which closely resembled the
one inherited from the previous administration, while at the same time
its director of social work is warning that ''extremely serious
consequences'' for the elderly and vulnerable will result from a #1.5m
cut in the social work budget.
The significance of this ''#10 a head'' scam is not to attribute some
unique act of local government wickedness to the Scot Nats. Promises,
cynically made and casually broken, are scarcely a novelty in politics
at any level. It does confirm, however, that when it comes to seeking
votes they are none too fussy about the methods employed.
I have a lot of respect for local government and people of all parties
who make a genuine commitment to it. The financial recompense is
pathetic and any minor straying from the path of righteousness is likely
to lead to ruination. Good councillors work at a very accountable level
for the benefit of their own communities, yet the means with which to
meet needs are cruelly limited.
An MP gets the mere overspill of housing cases: folk desperate for a
tenancy of their own or to escape from the misery of anti-social
neighbours (which, incidentally, Tony Blair is absolutely right to focus
on). Councillors live with that kind of diet in their homes, on the
phone, in street and pub, seven days of the week.
What many people find unpleasant about the Scot Nats in local
campaigning is that they cannot summon an ounce of generosity towards
anyone else who is trying to do their best for their communities. There
is a constant attempt to take on some cloak of superiority, and to
denigrate the motives as well as the policies of opponents.
The reality, as illustrated by the #10-a-head saga, is that there is
nothing about their record in Scottish local government which suggests
they are better than anyone else either in motivation or competence,
when it comes to delivering services.
If it was a Labour council which had just privatised eight industrial
estates by selling them to a London-based property firm, the air would
be tartan with charges of treachery and surrogate Toryism. Quisling
would probably get a few mentions for good measure.
In fact, it is the Nationalist-dominated Grampian council which
engaged in this extraordinary piece of family silver disposal. Perhaps
they can justify their action. But the one certainty is that it puts
them in the same boat as everyone else, when it comes to trying to make
ends meet in a hostile financial climate.
These are the elections which nobody, except the Tories, wanted and it
is doubtful if the Tories want them now. They are going to take another
pasting, even in the gerrymandered fiefdoms, and it serves them right.
But I would recognise that there are also Tory councillors, many of
whom will get the boot through no particular fault of their own, who
have given diligent and decent service to their own communities. It
shouldn't hurt anyone to acknowledge that.
The biggest problem facing local government, apart from money, is to
get enough people of calibre to stand under any label, particularly in
the new authorities which will carry awesome budgets and powers not
previously administered at such a local level.
At the end of the day, local government is not about the constitution
or even the big inter-party conflicts at Westminster, though decisions
made there obviously impinge heavily. It's about delivering the best
possible services at the most reasonable cost. That, and not by
gimmicks, is how councils and candidates should be judged.

Martin Amis is used
to taking criticism on
the chin, but now the
snipers are drawing
a bead on a new
target -- his much-
discussed #500,000
advance, and the
wisdom of going to
the dentist. But, as
John Linklater
discovers, he is far
from being down
in the mouth
AFTER decades of having the literary world in his face, Martin Amis is
resigned to its latest intrusion right into his mouth. In the early
years his exuberant writing talent was sufficient in itself to provoke
envy. He just got better, and a succession of glamorous partners brought
predictably sour comments. Now he has a new belter of a novel, The
Information, published on Monday, and a whopping advance with which to
infuriate his enemies. The final straw, apparently, was $20,000 of New
York orthodontics.
Amis had the expensive audacity to get his teeth fixed, and now the
impression is that a few of the Hampstead crowd are out to fix him.
Inviting you upstairs into his Notting Hill flat, from the incongruous
former rectory front double-door where his name is modestly dymo-taped
in plastic alongside a rinkydink electric bell, he does not give the
appearance of the man whose personal greed is alleged to have
destabilised the London publishing industry, and threatened generations
of writers with certain penury.
Yet here he is, in black Levis and beige sweatshirt, the man who so
incensed former Booker prize-winner A S Byatt that she told her
publishers at Random House that it was either her or Martin Amis's
teeth. She was not going to subsidise his dental work. If they met his
demand for a #500,000 advance, she was out of there. One agent later, as
half the planet has learned, Amis secured his advance from HarperCollins
and got implants screwed into his jaw.
''The Washington Post, for Christ's sake.'' He says it with more
weariness than rancour. ''The Washington Post said that mine was the
most famous set of teeth since Abraham Lincoln.'' None of this was ever
supposed to get out. The leaks suggest a vindictive motive. ''At least I
can hardly be neurotic about it any more, now that the whole world is in
my mouth. I hadn't been to a dentist for five years. That had been my
way of dealing with it. But if I had known all of this was going to
happen, I don't know what I would have done.''
Bad teeth, bad life. He blames it all on that period of his upbringing
in Wales, where he and his older brother were the victims of ''plaque
and candy floss'' in the water instead of fluoride. Amis is too wry, too
droll by half, to have ever developed much of a repertoire of flashing
smiles. His celebrated scowls, essayed from every book jacket since The
Rachel Papers (1973), have reinforced the false image of the arrogant
punk, the myth of his boundless conceit. Socially, he's different.
Socially, he's relaxed, poised, street urbane and good company. It's
just his flat that's a mess.
He has the classic excuse of the man now living singly. The boys have
been over. Not the lads. His boys, Louis and Jacob, eight and ten,
spider clamp masks and computer games. That was at the weekend. This is
Tuesday. It looks suspiciously as though he must have been playing them
a Nice album out of two speakers hunkered on a black carpet, because the
sleeve is still lying out among scattered videos (and grown men don't
listen alone to Nice any more). A veteran TV is dumped on an old black
trunk in the centre of the room, staring out a deep couch. A Fathers'
Day card from last year lingers on one of two well-stocked bookcases.
Two paper lightshades compete for which can look the more perforated and
sadly kiltered, two variations on a theme of exposed wire ribbing. The
Amis desk, word-processerless, typewriterless, dictaphoneless, is
lacking several drawer handles. All this place needs is a pile of
jotters and you would swear that Amis had taken up an undervalued career
as a primary school teacher and was basking in the domestic rewards.
Had the #500,000 cheque not come through? The flat had been a work
base for years. Its Spartan character has only acquired a mild pathos
since he started living here, but that arrangement is temporary. It is a
place to monitor the telephone messages, pick up the tennis gear (he
plays every afternoon) and brood his imaginative life on to the page (by
fountain pen, one suspects genuinely). He has often said, and it is
repeated in The Information -- a novel that deals hilariously with the
pains and humiliations of surviving in a competitive literary world --
that the writer comes most alive when alone. From a notably gregarious
practitioner this is a revealing observation.
The level of the advance has yet to receive adult consideration. The
novel took five years to write, so the remuneration must be seen
accordingly. The deal was not for The Information alone, but covers an
additional book of short stories, towards which he has a deposit of five
pieces, and it will take another year and a half to complete. #500,000
for six and a half years' work by a major artist would not distress many
cultures outside England. The current stushie bewilders Europeans,
convulses Americans and tempts serious observers here to investigate a
post-colonial explanation. You can't openly knock the Rushdies, the
Ishiguros, the Kureishis, the Okris, and the writers like Cas Phillips
who have internationalised the British novel. But you can affect to be
offended by Kelman's expletives, and sneer at his literary unworthiness
(because Scots suffer a racism waiver). And you can certainly stuff
little Martin, because he knows his own value. In a self-loathing
culture, that is offensive.
There is another angle from which this advance should be viewed. Amis
has been writing for 22 years. His first advance, when publishers were
indulging the son of a famous writer father, was #200 for The Rachel
Papers. He went up in steady increments for each of the six succeeding
novels and two non-fiction titles, until #1000 would become #4000, then
#15,000. When he finally broke through it was with London Fields, for
which he secured #100,000, a decent whack, but still only a third of the
deal that was being negotiated for Ian McEwan around the same time. This
time, at 45, Amis stuck out for a fee that he believed his career path
entitled him to (it has been an unqualified trajectory of critical and
readers' esteem) and he finds himself pilloried. One of the saddest
aspects of the affair is the break between Amis and long-term pal Julian
Barnes, after Amis ditched Pat Kavanagh as his agent. Kavanagh is
married to Barnes. There has been a letter to Amis. The pair are no
longer talking.
The surprise, then, is how little Amis has changed. We last met in
1984, when he was launching out with Money, the first of a London
trilogy which is completed by The Information, not a trilogy in subject
or recurring characters, but a developing theme of materialism, violence
and pain. The books are panoramic, big canvas stuff, essential reading
in late-millenium Britain. Amis may have periodic depressions when he
considers his own achievement (judging from the afflictions of the
Richard Tull character in the novel), but there is no trace of
bitterness or paranoia, no consuming guilt. He is getting on with
things. That is good news for his readers.

FRIENDS and fans of footballer Davie Cooper yesterday spoke fondly of
the quiet lad who became a national hero.
His sparkling talent and gentlemanly decency was obvious even in his
primary school days.
The boy who was to become known as Super Cooper won his first medal at
the age of 11 when he captained the team at Udston primary in Hamilton.
In his early secondary school days, he featured prominently in the
Hamilton under-15s.
Mr Tommy Gilligan, a teacher who helped run that team, said: ''David
was a small boy but had such talent that he could not be overlooked. He
was a treat to watch, even as a schoolboy. It was quite clear he had the
talent.
''I remember seeing him play even when he was at primary school. You
could not help but marvel at his skills.''
Mr Gilligan, who teaches modern languages at Hamilton's Earnock High
School, added: ''He also had very good personal qualities, even at that
stage. He had a very healthy approach to the game and was a good team
player. He would never do anything on the field to disgrace you.''
One of Mr Gilligan's colleagues at Earnock High, deputy head Ian
Nicoll, was an art teacher at the town's St John's Grammar when Cooper
was a pupil there.
He said: ''He showed lots of footballing skill and talent. Although he
was a small boy for his age, he was very courageous and honourable in
his dealings. He was always a very clean player.''
Mr Nicoll paid tribute to the links Cooper had maintained with local
schools for charitable and other events. ''He was looked up to by
pupils. He was regarded as a very decent person and fine role model for
young people.''
Cooper was playing for local amateur side Hamilton Avondale when the
17-year-old trainee printer was snapped up by Clydebank and began his
professional career.
Mr Bill Munro, Clydebank manager at the time, said: ''He gave so much
pleasure to so many and was far and way the greatest talent I have ever
worked with. He put so much into the game as a player -- and he was
looking forward to passing on his knowledge and skill to the new
generation of young stars.
''Davie Cooper wasn't just one of Scotland's greatest players -- he
was one of the game's nicest men.''
Cooper's passion for sport was wide-ranging: he was a keen squash and
tennis player and dabbled with golf. He was also a horse-racing
enthusiast who enjoyed a flutter and a day out at the races.
He shunned the limelight and preferred the company of his own circle
of friends to the glitter of the night-clubbing set. His desire for
privacy helped earn him the nickname Moody Blue in his Rangers' days.
Mr Stuart McLaren, a long-time friend, described him as ''his own
man''. He added: ''Nobody could tell him what to do. He wouldn't always
take people's advice but he was respected because he was an
individual.''
Mr McLaren, 46, of Regency Court, Hamilton, who had been due to play
squash with Cooper around the time the life support machine was switched
off, added: ''He could have been a superstar abroad but preferred his
own native heath and his own people round about him. He could have been
a millionaire, but decided to stay in Scotland.''
At the Santa Lucia, Hamilton, the player's favourite restaurant, owner
Mrs Rita Martalo said: ''He was a wonderful person. Davie was always the
same to everyone. He was always the same person even when he was a
famous footballer.''
In Brankholm Brae, Hamilton, where Cooper lived in a flat with his
parents as a boy, resident James Low, 69, said: ''I'm absolutely
devastated, like everyone in the street. Every time you saw him when he
was a wee boy, he had a ball at his feet. Even then he was football
daft. And after he moved away, if you saw him in the street he would
always stop and ask you how you were.''
Mr Pat Lyons, 53, who lived in the flat above the Cooper family, said:
''I remember when he was picked for the Mexico World Cup and Alex
Ferguson brought him back to see his parents. It was great to see him
doing so well. It didn't matter what team he played for, he was one of
our own.''
Sports broadcaster and former Rangers player Derek Johnstone described
Cooper as a great man as well as a great player. Visiting the hospital
to pay his respects, Johnsjtone said: ''I can't believe he has been
taken so young. My heart goes out to family. I can hardly believe this
has happened.''
Among other visitors at the hospital were Rangers striker Ally
McCoist, who was in tears, and Tommy Craig, the Scotland under-21 coach,
who had been at the training session in Cumbjernauld where Cooper
collapsed.
Cooper was capped 22 times for Scotland and played in the 1986 World
Cup finals. He began his career with Clydebank before moving in 1977 to
Rangers. He spent 12 seasons at Ibrox where he won a host of honours
before joining Motherwell. There he proved he could still win trophies
when the team lifted the Scottish Cup in 1991.
He rejoined Clydebank in December, 1993, as player and coach and had
been due to retire from playing at the end of this season.
Cooper is survived by his estranged wife, Christine, from whom he
separated several years ago, and their 10-year-old daughter, Nicola.
Yesterday, his girlfriend, Ms Thomson, was too grief-stricken to talk
when she arrived back from hospital at the detached villa she shared
with the footballer in Silvertonhill, Hamilton. Her mother, Lorraine
Cameron, said: ''We are just too upset to talk. We are devastated.''
The player's parents, Jock and Jean, both in their 70s, were being
comforted by relatives and friends at their home in Clarkwell Road,
Hamilton. A family friend said: ''They are absolutely devastated,
totally shattered. They just need time alone to try to come to terms
with this. Davie will be sadly missed not just by his family but by
everyone who knew him.''
At the home of Cooper's estranged wife in Motherwell, a close friend
said: ''They were not divorced, but were separated. He kept in touch
regularly with Christine by phoning and dropping in.''
The player's collapse on Wednesday happened during the filming of a
Scottish Television series on football skills which was planned for
transmission this summer. He was one of the main presenters and several
episodes of the series had already been recorded.
A spokesman for the STV said yesterday no decision had yet been taken
about what would happen with the project now. ''It is too early to say.
That is a decision to be taken later.''
The footballer was a role model for many young fans and his death will
be particularly upsetting for the group of school pupils who were taking
part in Wednesday's recording and witnessed his collapse.
A spokesman for Strathclyde Regional Council's education department
last night said that its psychological services staff would be available
to provide counselling if the pupils required it. ''There has been no
demand yet for this, but it is early days and it will no doubt take some
time to sink in.''

OVER the past few months, many references have been made to a bug
called the deadly E. coli virus. Is it time to get worried?
E. coli, or to give it its full name, Escherichia coli, is a kind of
bacterium. It is an organism smaller than human cells. It is not a bug:
bugs are insects thousands of times bigger. It is not a virus: viruses
are organisms a thousand times smaller.
Why is almost any disease-causing organism called a ''bug''? My own
theory for this colloquialism is that once upon a time, everyone knew
what bugs were. They lived in dirty houses, beside the wallpaper-paste
made from a bag of flour to a bucket of hot water, and they came out at
night to bite you when you were in bed. Bugs, while not pleasant, were
not instantly life-threatening and could be got rid of by sending for
Dan Dan the Sanitary Man.
Now imagine a GP telling a not-too-bright and very nervous patient the
results of his tests. If the doc says that the patient has a chronic
streptococcal infection of the oropharynx there is a distinct
possibility that he will run off and put his affairs in order. How much
easier to give the homely wee story of some bug lurking in the throat,
which the Good Doctor can easily chase away. You can be sure that the
word ''bug'' never appears in the case notes, but it is such a ''user
friendly'' little word that it persists.
There is no excuse for calling any bacterium a virus. They are not
even remotely related. The word is part of the name given a long time
ago before viruses could be seen. It meant ''poison''. While bacteria
could be filtered off using the appropriate filter, some liquid extracts
from diseased organisms could be filtered and still cause disease. They
were said to contain filterable viruses . . . poisons in solution. Much
later, these poisons were shown to be very tiny particles and even
later, with the advent of the electron microscope, they were ''seen''.
E. coli is not a virus.
How deadly is E. coli? If we are all carrying it around by the
billion, how can it be deadly? The germs live inside us in our lower
bowel and do us no harm whatsoever. They pay for their keep by helping
to increase our supply of some of the B vitamins. You can have this
quite painfully demonstrated by taking enough antibiotics to sterilise
your bowels. The ensuing glossitis (inflamation of the tongue) is not
pleasant, nor are the injections of vitamin B you will need to keep you
going until your intestinal friends re-establish themselves.
If E. coli stays in the bowel, it causes no problems. If it gets into
places where it is not normally found it can cause disease. The most
common E. coli infection is of the urinary system.
Like any other living organism, every E. coli is not the same. Some of
these varieties or ''strains'' can cause problems -- diarrhoea in new-
born babies, for instance. And farmers dread ''scour'', a diarrhoea so
severe it can kill calves and lambs by dehydration. ''Joint ill'' is
disease of lambs caused by E. coli getting into the body through the
navel. It is good practice to drench the umbilical cords of new lambs
with a powerful disinfectant. The new crop of lambs are now with us and
if you look you may see the tell tale signs of a ''skoosh'' of
disinfectant as a violet stain on the lamb's underside.
With E. coli so widespread, it is almost inevitable that it will get
into food, including milk, but even there, it should cause few problems.
It will grow quite happily on just about any food we use if it is kept
warm and moist.
This does not happen in a well-run home where moist food tends to be
hot enough to kill the germs, discourage handling and usually goes from
cooker to plate. Foods such as bread are too dry to allow the bacteria
to grow, cake is too sugary and biscuits are both. Wet food kept warmish
for a long time usually grows a population of other bacteria and can be
dangerous. E. coli, accustomed to a cosy 37C, grows very slowly in a
fridge. It is easily killed by heat and wiped out by pasteurisation. It
should never appear in the milk we buy.
E. coli can be useful to us. It is relatively harmless, but is passed
out by all of us in countless millions. It is also used as an indicator
organism to detect possible faecal contamination of water supplies.
With so few of the population passing out disease-causing organisms,
they are very few and far between and searching for them in water would
make needles in haystacks easy by comparison. A tiny amount of faecal
material can contaminate a huge volume of water and water authorities
check regularly for ''coliforms'' (E. coli and its colleagues). A simple
and highly sensitive test which helps maintain very high standards.
It is almost impossible to tune into a pop science programme without
being deluged with genetic engineering and DNA fingerprinting. E. coli
is one of the unsung heroes of this exciting new science. Much of the
early work in this field was done using E. coli. Dead cells leave
fragments of their insides around, and this includes bits of their
genetic material. Live cells can pick up some of the fragments and join
them into their own material. By studying the effects of transfer of
these differing fragments from one strain of the organism to others, the
boffins were able to work out which bit did what and also, what bit went
where.
When you are next invited to be amazed at research into the human
genome project, remember that much of the groundwork was done using the
humble ''bum bacillus'' -- E. coli.

THE Scottish National Party's latest recruit said yesterday that
Scotland's business community had ''nothing to fear'' from independence.
Businessman David McCarthy, 57, said Scotland was rich enough and
talented enough to make a pretty good job of running her own affairs and
looking after her own people.
He added ''The twenty-first wealthiest nation in the world has nothing
to fear from going it alone. It's high time that we did so.''
Mr McCarthy made his comments as he was welcomed into the party by
leader Alex Salmond in Edinburgh. Mr Salmond said he was sure that over
the next few years many others would be ''planting their flag in the
sand'' and stating the business case for independence.
Mr McCarthy, referring to his article in yesterday's Herald when he
outlined his reasons for supporting independence in Europe and the SNP
said: ''The Tories' disinterest in Scotland was well illustrated by
their attitude to my own industry and their inability and unwillingness
to help either at home or in Brussels.
''While the Labour case for devolution is superficially attractive, in
reality it does not, and cannot bring home real and effective power
where it matters.
''That is in finance or in relations with the European Union.''

Paris, Thursday
A DAY after US Defence Secretary William Perry expressed alarm about a
substantial build-up of Iranian armed forces at the entrance to the
Persian Gulf, a report in Paris accuses the French Government of selling
arms to Tehran in defiance of an international arms embargo and
government policy.
The magazine L'Express yesterday placed responsibility at the door of
Interior Minister Charles Pasqua.
Sources in the French Foreign Office and the DGSE, the French Foreign
Intelligence Service, told the magazine that arms, probably
air-to-ground missiles, were illegally exported to Tehran last October.
The report claims an Air Algerie plane flew from the military airport
of Boufarik in Algeria on October 11 to the former US Nato airfield of
Chateauroux-Deols in France to pick up the arms consignment. Instead of
returning to Boufarik, the plane flew to Cyprus, where the cargo was
unloaded on to an Iranian aircraft.
The deal was reportedly planned by Jean-Charles Marchiani, a French
Government official and close friend of Mr Pasqua, who helped free
French hostages in Lebanon in 1988.
Mr Pasqua had been motivated, the magazine argued, by a desire to
appease Tehran and prevent terrorist attacks on French territory on the
eve of the trial last November of three Iranians accused of murdering
the former Iranian Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar near Paris in 1991.
In a statement yesterday, the Prime Minister's offices, which normally
give permission for arms exports, said they had given no authorisation
for such a deal with Iran.
Cyprus tonight denied ever selling on weapons and said the French
missiles would go on show in a military parade on Saturday.
Mr Pasqua, who had refused to comment earlier to L'Express, yesterday
described the report as ''a particularly serious operation of
disinformation'' and asked the Ministry of Justice to take legal moves
against the magazine.
However he has on several occasions in the past nine years made
important, under-the-table concessions to the revolutionary regime in
Iran.
Whatever the effect of these latest allegations on France's allies,
they can only damage further the presidential election campaign of Prime
Minister Balladur, of whom Mr Pasqua is a leading supporter.

Sydney, Thursday
AN Australian mother and her ex-husband asked a coroner today to
acknowledge that a dingo killed their baby 15 years ago in the
Australian outback.
Lindy Chamberlain, who was convicted of her daughter Azaria's murder
but released from jail after three years, and Michael Chamberlain made
the request to the Northern Territory coroner.
The coroner's court never made a finding on exactly how nine-week-old
Azaria died, although it ordered the couple to stand trial for murder in
1982. Michael Chamberlain was given an 18-month suspended sentence for
being an accessory.
Azaria disappeared from a camping ground at Ayers Rock in August,
1980, and her body has never been found. Her mother, now remarried, has
always said a dingo took the baby.
The Chamberlains' request for a final coroner's verdict follows an
appeal for submissions last December from Northern Territory Coroner
John Lowndes, who said he wanted to close the book on the case.
The submission urges him to find ''that Azaria Chamberlain died
accidentally as a result of being taken by a dingo from her tent at
Ayers Rock'', according to their lawyer, Stuart Tipple.
Lindy Chamberlain was released from jail and the Northern Territory
Court of Criminal Appeal quashed her and her then husband's convictions
in 1988. An official inquiry had cleared the couple the year
before.--Reuter.

While litigants down south 'frolic' at the taxpayers' expense, Scots
can no longer afford to go to court. Elizabeth Buie reports
MR WILLIAM BROWN, a pensioner living on a council estate in
Uddingston, needs to turn the television up high before he can hear it.
He misses a lot of conversations going on around him.
Not that that's all that unusual in a 76-year-old man. But in Brown's
case, he believes his deafness was caused, at least in part, by working
as a maintenance electrical engineer without ear protection in the
noisiest parts of the former Caterpillar plant between 1964 and 1981.
Medical tests suggested he had a good case for compensation in an
action for industrial deafness. Caterpillar's insurance company, Iron
Trades, nevertheless refused to pay compensation.
But it now looks -- because of legal aid rules -- that he will never
know whether he would have succeeded in court. The Scottish Legal Aid
Board has asked him to provide a contribution of #707 before it will
support his damages claim.
Brown is fairly typical of a number of people in Scotland who are just
above the threshold that entitles them to free legal aid.
Not everyone is so unlucky, however.
This week the legal row between former Rangers and Liverpool manager
Graeme Souness and his former wife Danielle hit the headlines. Mrs
Souness, currently on legal aid, received #500,000 under a Scottish
divorce court settlement six years ago. She is now seeking to reopen her
claim in England on the grounds that her former husband failed to reveal
full details of his assets and exerted undue pressure on her to settle.
Mr Souness's lawyers are seeking to enforce a suspended jail sentence
against her for ''blatant disregard'' of a court order requiring her to
produce bank statements indicating what had happened to money in her
accounts.
The judge sitting in the High Court case insisted on an early date for
a full hearing and issued a warning that he was ''not going to sit idly
by and see public funds used on a frolic of this kind''.
Scottish solicitors are somewhat nonplussed as to how Mrs Souness
could be in receipt of legal aid. The only explanations they can suggest
are that either she has not yet received her divorce settlement, or else
her money is in other assets, such as a large house, and she has no
disposable income.
They are more used to dealing with cases such as Brown's, and then
facing the frustration of being told that their clients cannot proceed
to court because they cannot pay legal aid contribution costs.
Brown, and his wife Ina, 70, say they have no bank balance and
struggle to meet their monthly rent, council tax, gas and electricity
bills. He receives #63 a week in state pension plus #13 a week pension
from Caterpillar, while his wife receives #41 a week.
Brown's solicitor, Mr Cameron Fyfe, of Ross Harper and Murphy, said
the board was asking him to pay off the #700 at 10 monthly instalments
of #70.
However, Brown said the most he could manage was #10 a week -- and
even that would be a struggle. His solicitor thinks it is unlikely the
board will alter its assessment.
''It makes you wonder what is happening -- or if you are going to be
worse off than you are at the moment. I am 76 now -- they should hurry
up and get me something before it is too late,'' said Brown.
Brown said in some ways he wished he had never embarked on the claim.
''It has been too much hassle,'' he said.
Fyfe said: ''People who are relatively poor like this guy are either
asked for a huge contribution which they cannot afford or are not
eligible for legal aid at all. One is as bad as another. At least 30% or
40% of clients are turning round now and saying they cannot afford to go
ahead. They are being denied justice because of their financial
position.
''The whole principle behind legal aid was to help a poor man or poor
woman and give them access to courts.''
He added that the Government had to increase its threshold for
payments because too many people on low incomes were being denied aid.
''There are two problems. The client is being asked to pay more and
more and the fees to the solicitor are very low and because of that it
would appear that more and more solicitors are not doing civil legal
aid. It is not worth their while,'' said Fyfe.
Mr Paul Burns, convener of the Law Society of Scotland and a member of
its Legal Aid Committee, said: ''The number of actions in the sheriff
court has dropped by about one-third as a result of increased legal aid
contributions and the increased fees imposed. What it has meant is that
a significant number of people no longer can afford to go to court and
people entitled to justice are not seeking it,'' said Burns.
He added that the English legal aid system operated under the English
legal system's rules.
''We are constantly worried that English solutions are imposed on
Scottish problems,'' said Burns. Sums involved in English criminal cases
were ''remarkable by Scottish standards'', he said.
Nevertheless, even in Scotland it was the cost of going to law that
dominated whether or not to go to court, said Burns.
''The alternative is the American system -- or perhaps finding a
middle way,'' he said.
The problem with the no-win-no-fee scheme that has already been
allowed on a trial basis in Aberdeen has advantages, but some
difficulties. It works if the litigant wins, but what if he or she
loses? The litigant's lawyer might waive the fee, but what if the
successful party's lawyer refused to waive his?
The American contingency fee system has been criticised because the
lawyer has a vested interest in the outcome of a case and it encourages
''ambulance-chasers''.
Nevertheless, Burns's personal view is: ''We will end up with a form
of contingency fee for exactly the same reasons as the Americans
developed theirs 100 years ago. Otherwise I do not know how people will
get access to justice without the public groaning at the cost.''

Buenos Aires
SCIENTISTS around the world are closely monitoring changes in
Antarctica's ancient ice shelf, which has begun to break up in warming
seas.
A barrier insulating the continental ice cap from melting is slowly
being destroyed, Argentine scientists warned today.
''The first thing I did was cry,'' said Dr Rodolfo del Valle, who
discovered a 40-mile-long crack in the northernmost part of the Larsen
ice shelf that runs 600 miles up the Antarctic peninsula.
Scientists predicted the warming climate in the Antarctic peninsula
would lead to the beginning of the break-up of the ice shelf in 10 years
but it is happening much more quickly than they had expected.
The shelves help insulate the continental ice cap from warmer weather.
While few scientists believe the entire ice cap can melt, even its
partial disappearance could prove catastrophic.
The ice cap covers the continent like a giant wedding cake and is on
average 6000ft thick. It contains 70% of the world's fresh water and if
it all melted away that would cause sea levels to rise by 120 to 300ft.
The cracking of the shelf is an even more worrying sign of warming in
the peninsula than the giant iceberg which British scientists said broke
off the shelf in January, said Del Valle, who heads the earth sciences
department of Argentina's National Antarctic Direction.
Del Valle was at an Antartic camp on James Ross Island in January when
he was radioed by colleagues from an Argentine base on the Larsen ice
shelf.
The scientists were being shaken by constant ice quakes.
''On January 23, they called me over the radio and said: 'Rudi,
something's happening, the ice shelf is breaking'. An enormous crack had
opened from the edge of the shelf on the Weddel Sea up to the
mountains,'' del Valle said.
Flying overhead in a light plane, Del Valle saw the ice shelf, up to
1000ft thick in parts, breaking up to expose patches of sea, probably
for the first time in 20,000 years.
''It was spectacular, because what once was a platform of ice 40 miles
wide had been broken up into pieces that looked like bits of polystyrene
foam smashed by a child.''
''Everyone has their attention fixed on climate change and on the
theory that says that the first step towards the destruction of the
western Antarctic ice cap is the breaking up of the ice shelves,'' del
Valle said.
Measurements in the Antarctic peninsula show its average temperature
had risen by over 2C (36F) since 1930, with around half the warming
occurring in the last 20 years.
Scientists still do not agree on the extent of global warming caused
by burning fossil fuels. Del Valle thinks warming might be taking place
naturally but that greenhouse gases might be dangerously accelerating
the process.
''I think the process is like a father pushing his child in a swing.
If the father pushes too hard the swing twists around, the child falls
down and the game is over.''--Reuter.

SCOTTISH Liberal Democrat councillors allow the voice of the ordinary
citizen to be heard in council circles, the party's leader, Mr Jim
Wallace, claimed yesterday.
From Annan to Aberdeen they had put their commitment to open
government into practice, he said.
Speaking in Edinburgh, Mr Wallace said: ''Our message in this election
is that Liberal Democrat councillors make a real difference -- local
government is more responsive to the people, education is given the
priority it deserves and there is positive action to promote the
environment.''
Mr Wallace was also in Dunfermline yesterday, where he met candidates
and climbed the spiral staircase to the top of Dunfermline Abbey.
The party's increased support at successive elections in North East
Fife, Annandale and Eskdale and Grampian showed there was widespread
satisfaction with Liberal Democrat councillors in action, he said.
Education was top of the party's agenda, he said. Where they were in
power in local government, as in Grampian, they had responded to the
challenge.
The Liberal Democrats have published a dossier ''A Record of Action --
a promise of more'' designed to highlight their achievements in local
government which they claim have often gone unreported.
It says that the party's councillors have been at the forefront of
opening up council proceedings to the public.

<HEADLINE>Ancillaries latest to reject 1% NHS offer</HEADLINE>

SOME 100,000 hospital ancillaries yesterday became the latest group to
reject a ''derisory'' 1% pay offer, as their 150,000 NHS administrative
and clerical colleagues had done the previous day.
The 20,000 ambulance service workers are also expected to reject the
pay deal next Monday.
By then virtually all of the one million NHS workers will have thrown
out broadly similar pay offers, based on the controversial pay review
board awards to 600,000 nurses and midwives and 360,000 in professions
allied to medicine.
The unions claim that the non-board offers are even worse, as they do
not specify that up to 2% more could be on offer locally, as is the case
with the nurses' offer.
Against this background, health service chief executives, who received
4% last year have been forecast to receive a further 3% this year,
according to a report from the Institute of Health Service Management.
Mr Bob Abberley, head of health at the union Unison, said that such an
offer to management would only fuel the outrage felt by NHS staff at
their ''miserly 1% award''.
Following yesterday's negotiations with the NHS, at which the prospect
of local pay and conditions bargaining was suggested, Ms Lynnette
Savings, the staff side secretary, said that to offer 1% to hospital
ancillaries, who are some of the lowest-paid workers in the country, was
an ''absolute disgrace''.
It would just about buy each one a national lottery ticket a week and
they would stand about as much chance of winning a fortune on the
lottery as they would of getting a decent pay rise through local
bargaining, she added.
Unison, which has a total of 450,000 members in the NHS, is preparing
the ground for an industrial action ballot, as is the Royal College of
Midwives, following its historic decision to ditch its traditional ban
on industrial action in the light of members' indignation at the offer.
Next week the Community and District Nurses Association will reveal
the results of a ballot on dropping its no-strike policy and the 300,000
member Royal College of Nursing will consider a similar move next month.
The health unions have declared next Thursday, March 30, as NHS Fair
Pay Day, when they and their supporters plan lunchtime demonstrations
outside every NHS building to draw attention to their pay campaign for a
3% nationally-based increase.

THE PARENTS of a Strathclyde policeman who died from a stab wound last
year in the line of duty yesterday watched proudly as two female
recruits shared an award in their son's memory.
The first presentation of the Constable Lewis Fulton Memorial Trophy
for life-saving skills among Scotland's trainee officers was made to
25-year-old Margaret Hendry, from Dundee, and Helen Torbet, 23, of
Stranraer. The awards were made at the Scottish Police Training College,
Tulliallan Castle, near Alloa.
Life-saving played an important role in the life of 28-year-old Mr
Fulton, from Kilmarnock, who was honoured several times before his death
in a Glasgow street when he was assisting colleagues trying to arrest a
man. Before joining the police Mr Fulton, who was married with a baby
son, was a lifeguard.
His mother Mrs Georgette Fulton, 54, and her father, Mr George
Pollock, 88, who also attended yesterday's prize-giving, have also been
involved in life-saving activities.
Mrs Fulton and her 58-year-old husband, Lewis, spoke of the pride they
felt when the trophy, funded by the local Ayrshire community, was handed
over.
She said she was delighted the two women officers had shared it,
adding: ''I just hope they never have to use their skills.''

CARE in the community and services for the elderly are under threat
from local government reorganisation and Government funding cuts, Shadow
Social Security Secretary Donald Dewar warned yesterday.
He forecast that home helps, concessionary fares, and sheltered
housing would be among services and provision threatened.
Mr Dewar made his comments during a visit to the Cromwell Court
sheltered housing complex in Glasgow, where he launched a Scottish
Labour Party consultation paper, Caring for the Community, with
Dunfermline West Labour MP Ms Rachel Squire.
Ms Squire, head of the party's community care taskforce, said the
consultation document would draw attention to threatened services while
highlighting the commitment of Scottish Labour councils to ''defend the
right of the most vulnerable in our society''.
The MPs said the Cromwell Court complex, run by the Labour-controlled
Glasgow District Council, was a ''shining example'' of how community
care should be, ''allowing people to live in the community with a
combination of support and independence''.
Mr Dewar said the Prime Minister had accepted that it was the duty of
Government to ''reduce inequality''. Yet, claimed Mr Dewar, Government
policies were having exactly the opposite effect in Scotland.
The Labour MP for Glasgow Garscadden said: ''Poverty and inequality
have grown to an extent that threatens social stability.''
Ms Squire said: ''Community care is an excellent principle which has
been turned into a nightmare under this Government.''
She said Labour councils throughout Scotland were helping to improve
the lives of tens of thousands of vulnerable people ''in the face of
chronic underfunding''.
Labour would also demand an end to means testing of community care
provision which could result in almost 25,000 Scots losing their right
to invalidity benefit over the next two years.
The SNP was also criticised. Mr Dewar claimed Nationalist-controlled
councils in Grampian and Tayside had been ''governed by expediency''
where ''promises have been broken and trust abused''.
He was echoed by Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson who
demanded that SNP leader Alex Salmond apologise for his party's broken
pledges.
In Aberdeen, Mr Robertson said: ''The SNP separatists cannot be
trusted to run any Scottish councils. Their record since last year shows
that, in power, they break promises and privatise public assets just
like the Tories.

THE MP for Skye has demanded an explanation from the Secretary of
State following yesterday's Herald report that the Kyle of Lochalsh
ferry may run initially in direct competition to the new Skye Bridge.
Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye
tabled parliamentary questions for ''priority reply''. He wants Mr Ian
Lang to clear up the apparent confusion as to whether the Railway Users
Consultative Committee for Scotland still has the sole right to call a
public inquiry into the withdrawl of the Kyle/Kyleakin ferry.
The Government has cast doubt on whether the RUCCS, created by the
1993 Railway Act, retains this power over ferry withdrawals which its
predecessor, the Scottish Transport Users Consultative Committee, had.
If it still has the power, a public inquiry could postpone the
withdrawal of the ferry, run by Government-owned Caledonian MacBrayne.
Mr Kennedy said yesterday: ''Those of us who have campaigned
consistently against a toll-imposed bridge have always pointed to the
glaring inconsistency of a supposedly free-market administration
foisting only one means of access upon people, where passage between the
Isle of Skye and the mainland is concerned.
''Ongoing competition between the toll bridge and a continuing ferry
service would be perfectly healthy in my view, even if only on a
pedestrian basis.''
Meanwhile, it has emerged the man to be responsible for running the
new toll bridge is the man who, until December, was responsible for
running ferries to Skye.
Mr Russell Thomson, 34, is assistant director of personnel at
Caledonian MacBrayne's Gourock headquarters.
He told The Herald yesterday: ''For the five-and-a-half years between
April 1989 and last December, I was the ferry manager on the
Kyle/Kyleakin ferry. With the bridge being built I was offered
alternative employment down here. But after five-and-half-years on Skye
my wife and I wanted to remain on the island.
''I appreciate the toll bridge is a very sensitive issue in Skye with
the demise of the ferries and the toll structure. But before I saw
myself as being responsible for providing a service from Skye to the
mainland and my new job as Skye Bridge administrator will be largely the
same.''
Mr Thomson will be employed by the bridge builder, Millers, within its
civil engineering division and takes up the post on April 17.

<TEXT>
THE gulf in lifestyles between actress and model Elizabeth Hurley and
one of four teenage girls accused of robbing her, was compared in court
yesterday to the difference between princess and pauper.
However, at Southwark Crown Court, Judge Gerald Butler, QC, stressed
the importance of treating both women's evidence equally.
He spoke out after defence counsel, Mr Philip Statman, said the lives
of 29-year-old Ms Hurley -- who has a multi-million pound contract with
cosmetic company Estee Lauder -- and the 17-year-old unemployed girl who
denies robbing her, were diametrically opposed.
But they were equal in the eyes of the law.
''Unless you live on another planet, the celebrity status of Miss
Hurley will be known to all of you. But in this court that is wholly
irrevelant,'' he said.
The jury of five women and seven men are due to retire today to
consider their verdict.
Mr Statman said that Ms Hurley was probably one of the most famous
faces of the year, but the lifestyle of his client -- who cannot be
identified for legal reasons, and is known as Girl C -- was in complete
contrast.
0 ''If you look at them together, they are almost like the princess
and the pauper,'' he said.
However, he told the jury: ''Probably for the first and only time in
their lives, before this court, they started out as totally equal
individuals as they gave evidence, we are all equal before the law.''
Miss C's co-defendants, who also deny robbing Miss Hurley of #10 and
some photographs, are Miss Christina Guerrine, 18, of Bethnal Green,
east London, and Miss Carlene Irving, also 18, of Shepherd's Bush, west
London.
A fourth -- known as girl B, also 17, has pleaded guilty to robbing
the actress and will be sentenced later.
The prosecution alleged they robbed Miss Hurley at knifepoint last
November, as she walked alone to the home she shares with Four Weddings
and a Funeral Star Hugh Grant, in Kensington, west London.
The prosecution said all four girls played a part in the robbery and
deliberately picked a woman walking alone in a quiet street.
However, counsel for the three in the dock, alleges that only the girl
with the knife -- the 17-year-old who has admitted the robbery and is
known as girl B -- carried out the crime.
The trial continues.

A FATAL accident inquiry into the death of a doctor in an avalanche
was told yesterday by an expert witness that Dr Katharine Herd's life
might have been saved if she had not been roped to two other climbers.
A senior police officer, who admitted basic mistakes had been made in
call-out procedures, also told the hearing he would have called in a
rescue helicopter almost and hour earlier than happened.
Mr Mick Tighe, a former Royal Marine Arctic warfare instructor and
internationally qualified mountain guide, is now a member of Lochaber
Mountain Rescue Team and one of Scotland's most expert climbers.
Yesterday, after sitting through three days of evidence at Dingwall
Sheriff Court into the death of 28-year-old Dr Herd, who was swept down
3458ft Liathach, in Torridon, Wester Ross, in January 1994, Mr Tighe was
called to the witness box.
Dr Herd, of Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire, had been on an introductory ice
and snow course with 18-year-old Mr Marcus Cross, from Aberdeen, and
27-year-old Dr Robin Dawson of Dumfries.
They were being instructed by mountain guide Mr Kevin O'Neill, from
Cumbria, who at the time was employed by Martin Moran Mountaineering,
based at Strathcarron.
Mr Tighe criticised the fact that Mr O'Neill did not see for himself
that his party knew how to use their ice axes before the climb proper
began.
Earlier, the inquiry had heard that Mr Cross had managed to brake
himself as the snow gave way but was then tugged back and down by the
two other climbers roped behind him.
It was Mr Cross who, although injured himself, attended to Dr Herd and
Dr Dawson before descending the hill for help. Mr Tighe said: ''In my
opinion he deserves a pat on the back.''
Mr Tighe said contrary to what had come out in evidence it was not
common practice to have students roped together, as in this case.
He suggested that if they had to be roped he would have expected the
instructor to be on the same rope. ''If that had been the case Kevin and
Marcus might have been able to brake the party.''
''Marcus was able to arrest himself and the party momentarily before
being pulled down. If he hadn't been tied on he would not have gone
down.
''Maybe only Robin would have gone down the gully.''
Earlier, Chief Inspector Cathel MacLeod, of the Northern Constabulary,
said he had not been told of the avalanche until the rescue was all
over.
He said if he had been alerted at the time of the 999 call, as he
should have been, he would have called for a helicopter right away.
The inquiry heard that the duty controller at Dingwall divisional HQ
had not followed the laid-down procedure and called out the mountain
rescue team after receiving the 999 call. She also failed to alert the
senior duty officer at the time of the call.
Instead Mrs Elaine Cannon contacted Constable James Fraser at Gairloch
and left it to him to do the call-out.
PC Fraser said he discovered that the mountain rescue team was out on
exercise and he decided to drive to Kinlochewe, which took him about 50
minutes, to get a mountain rescue radio to call them.
At Kinlochewe he had met the deputy leader of the team and after
discussing the situation it was decided then to call for a helicopter.
Sheriff Principal Douglas Risk said he would issue a written
determination in due course.

TERMITE flatulence is to blame for as much as one-fifth of the world's
methane, one of the ''greenhouse gases'' causing global warming,
scientists say.
The termites produce about 176bn lb of methane a year as they munch
their way through decayed trees and other forest soil, according to Dr
Paul Eggleton of the Natural Environment Research Council.
''It's a lot of methane but there are a lot of termites,'' he said.
There are more than 3000 species of termite in the tropics.
Dr Eggleton said it was not the termites that destroy houses which
were to blame for the gas: ''It's the ones that actually feed in the
soil that produce methane.''
Dr Eggleton, a termite biologist, and colleagues were taking part in a
five-year project to find out how many termites there are and how much
methane they produce.
''We need to know this because we need to work out what the budgets
are for all possible sources of greenhouse gases,'' he said.
Termites do not produce as much methane as cows and sheep do.
Scientists estimate the farm animals produce about 100 million tonnes a
year.
When ruminants like cows and sheep munch hard-to-digest grass, they
need help from special bacteria in their multiple stomachs -- which in
turn produce methane-laden belches. In termites the methane comes out in
the form of flatulence.
''This is a natural source that has been around for millions of years
and there is nothing we can do about it,'' Dr Eggleton stressed, ''but
we must take it into account.''--Reuter.

Kamiku Isshiki, Friday.
JAPANESE police raided a large complex of the Aum Shinri Kyo sect in
this village west of Tokyo for a third successive day today.
Television reports said police also raided the Osaka branch office of
the Aum Shinri Kyo (Supreme Truth sect) in western Japan.
Yesterday a thousand police in chemical-warfare gear mounted a second
raid on a hideaway of the secretive religious sect and found ingredients
for the nerve gas used in the deadly attack on Tokyo's underground.
Police called off their search of the complex in the small village of
Kamiku Isshiki yesterday because the chemicals were so dangerous, but
had said they would return.
The horrific attack on the underground system killed 10 people and
injured 5500, and police sources confirmed yesterday that the sect was
suspected of being involved.
Police said they seized sodium fluoride and phosphorus trichloride --
both ingredients of the nerve gas sarin -- in a second day of raids on
the complex at the foot of Mount Fuji.
The sect has denied involvement in the gas attack and has accused the
government of framing it. A sect spokesman said the chemicals were not
used to make lethal gases but for welding and processing computer chips.
However Hidenori Watanabe, a chemistry professor at Tokyo University,
said: ''The discovery of these two chemicals greatly increases chances
they were trying to produce or already had produced sarin. The two
substances are the main ingredients of sarin.''
The Kamiku Isshiki complex includes several groups of coarse
prefabricated buildings, some made of corrugated metal and some of blue
fibreglass.
The building nearest to the entrance has a sign in English: ''Welcome
Victory''.
Police said they found huge amounts of other dangerous chemicals such
as cyanide compounds, packed in heavy-duty paper, some of which were
ripped open.
The bags were too dangerous to move so police suspended the raid until
army chemical experts could be called in.
Loads of blue plastic canisters and piles of rubble could be seen
yesterday, along with building materials including steel girders, which
sect members apparently used to build a crude barricade on Tuesday night
before the first raid.
The search proceeded without resistance. Some followers, with shaved
heads, stood watching the police.--Reuter.

NEW YORK: A Roman Catholic group is threatening to ''blacken the

to open across the US on Good Friday. Mark Gill, marketing president for
Miramax, the Disney-owned company which is releasing the BBC-produced
film, said his firm was considering delaying the nationwide opening.
The film features five fictional priests, two of whom are sexually
active: one gay and one heterosexual. The other three priests are a
''drunk,'' a ''madman'' and a ''heartless, tyranical'' bishop, said
William Donohue, president of the 200,000-member Catholic League.
Donohue called on Disney to withdraw the film, or at least publicly
disassociate itself from it, otherwise, the company would face a
possible boycott or protest campaign by shareholders.
Gill defended the film as portraying ''not satanic figures, but real
people in a real world''.

Geneva, Thursday
THE United States and Russia ended two days of talks today without
resolving key disputes over issues such as Russian nuclear sales to Iran
that could sour a presidential summit in Moscow in May.
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev and US Secretary of State
Warren Christopher nevertheless appeared determined to restore ties
badly bruised by the recent conflict in Chechnya.
''I would say that indeed the honeymoon has come to an end,'' said
Kozyrev, referring to Washington's close ties with President Boris
Yeltsin after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
''However the sobering-up period in the wake of the honeymoon ended
not in divorce, but in a growing ability to resolve jointly problems
that we face,'' he told a joint news conference.
''Something that we won't allow to happen is unfaithfulness.''
After seven hours of meetings aiming to set the agenda for the summit
between Yeltsin and President Bill Clinton, the two ministers
acknowledged disagreement on various questions, including Russia's plan
to sell nuclear reactors to Iran and Moscow's campaign to quell
Chechnya.
They also disagreed on whether Yeltsin should have an expanded role in
this year's annual summit of the Group of Seven (G7) main industrialised
countries -- the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Germany,
and Canada.
Kozyrev said discussions were under way to have Russia take part in G7
economic discussions at the June summit in Canada. Moscow was admitted
to G7 political talks only last year.
He said it was pointless to keep Russia out of important economic
talks because it was one of the world's largest creditor nations as well
as having a large international debt.
However Christopher, who told Kozyrev privately that Russia's role
would not be expanded now because of Chechnya, insisted: ''There will be
no substantial change from last year's level of participation.''
He warned again that Russia was paying a high price for its
adventurism in Chechnya and should end the war quickly, but there was no
sign that Moscow planned to stop at anything less than full military
victory in the region.
Indeed today the Russian Government announced the capture by its
forces of the strategic town of Argun, one of the few remaining rebel
strongholds in breakaway Chechnya.
The Clinton administration has been under pressure from Congress to
take a tougher line toward Russia because of Chechnya and because Moscow
has refused to cancel a $1bn ##6660m) deal to provide nuclear reactors
to Iran.
Russian officials today confirmed their commitment to go through with
the deal. Kozyrev said Russia saw no problem in its co-operation with
Iran because Iran belonged to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and
any nuclear programme fell under international safeguards.
Christopher said he showed Kozyrev what Washington believed was
evidence of Iran's intentions to develop nuclear weapons.--Reuter.

Gainesville, Thursday,
THE case of a Florida teenager accused of murdering British tourist
Gary Colley at a highway rest stop in Florida was with the jury today.
John ''Billy Joe'' Crumitie, 18, took the stand today and denied even
being at the rest stop near Monticello, far less firing a gun into a
car.
Mr Colley, 34, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, was shot in the neck and
killed. His girlfriend, Margaret Jagger, 36, was shot and wounded.
Crumitie was charged with first-degree murder, attempted murder, and
attempted armed robbery. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison.
His first trial ended in a hung jury.
In his closing arguments, defence lawyer Dwight Wells said his client
''was not at the rest stop. He was not at the shooting.''
Wells noted that none of the state's experts were able to link
Crumitie to the crime through fingerprints, DNA, or hair.
However prosecutor Michael Schneider said that Crumitie coldly fired
into the car ''like he would shoot a dog''.
Co-defendants who have made plea bargains and have already been
convicted in the case have implicated Crumitie, and Schneider said their
testimony should be believed.--AP.

Washington, Thursday,
THE FBI has launched a publicity campaign to advertise the $4m reward
offered for the two Lockerbie suspects from Libya.
A reward of $2m (#1.3m) each offered for the capture of the mastermind
of the World Trade Centre bombing contributed to the man's arrest in
Pakistan last month.
The FBI has also, rather belatedly, put the two Libyans on its 10 Most
Wanted list. That is a purely symbolic gesture. However, a garish
poster, showing a treasure-chest filled with banknotes and photographs
of Abdel Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, is being distributed
around the world and may prove more effective.
FBI officials who made the announcement were asked if they were
certain that the two were the real culprits. There have been many
allegations that Libya was not involved in the bombing, and that others,
perhaps Iranians or Syrians, were responsible.
The bureau's assistant director for national security, Robert Bryant,
replied: ''We're absolutely convinced that these two Libyan intelligence
officers were involved.''
He said that there were other suspects, described as unindicted
co-conspirators, but added that all the tens of thousands of leads that
have been pursued since the bombing in December, 1989, have been
exhausted to no effect.
The only leads that were productive led to these two. He was asked
where the two men might be, and replied that the bureau had sporadic
reports that they were in Libya. He discounted reports that they had
been executed.
Meanwhile, a former aide to PLO chairman Yasser Arafat today claimed
to have proof that Libya was not involved in the bombing.
Bassam Abu Sharif, Arafat's former media adviser, told an Arabic daily
newspaper in Jordan that he had a file on the Lockerbie incident and
would hand it over to a ''fair and just'' international court if
sanctions on Libya were lifted.

THE Scottish economy seems set to receive a huge financial boost
through a plan announced yesterday to strengthen the country's
electricity links with England and Wales.
An extra #40m a year could be injected into the economy under a
proposal which will enable ScottishPower and Hydro-Electric to generate
more electricity for sale in the South.
Last night the power plan was welcomed by the trade union movement and
by Scots industry, including the new company that recently took over
British Coal's assets in Scotland.
Mr Campbell Christie, STUC general secretary and a director of Mining
(Scotland) Ltd, owners of operators The Scottish Coal Company, said
upgrading the link would protect thousands of jobs within Scots
industries into the next century.
Mr David Brewer, the Scottish Coal Company chief executive, said he
was confident it could continue to meet ScottishPower's requirements for
coal in terms of price, quality and availability.
Mr Howard Jordan, chief executive of Scottish Engineering, said that
with more than #52m being spent on the project he envisaged a healthy
input from Scottish engineering supply companies.
According to ScottishPower the proposal will involve an increase of
the capacity of Anglo-Scottish links from 1600 megawatts to 2200.
Additional output from ScottishPower's coal-fired generating plants at
Longannet in Fife and Cockenzie in East Lothian will increase coal needs
by up to another million tonnes annually.
The transmission system to be strengthened and modified runs east from
Strathaven to Edinburgh and south through the Borders to Newcastle.
Subject to planning approval, work is expected to start later this
year and will take just over two years.
Mr Alan Richardson, managing director of ScottishPower's transmission
division, said they expected their coal burn in Scotland to reach 5m
tonnes by the year 2000 -- almost double today's figure.
''This is good news for Scotland's coal and electricity industries and
good news for the Scottish economy.''

THE footpaths at Bennachie, one of the most popular destinations for

Enterprise warned yesterday.
A report by the group, a branch of the Forestry Commission, estimated
that #140,000 is needed to protect the paths.
It already spends an average of #10,000 each year on repairs. However,
appeals for help have so far amassed only one-third of the amount
needed.
A spokesperson said: ''Forest Enterprise is doubling its current
expenditure, but this falls far short of the funds needed and it is
looking for partners to help with the expensive repairs.''
Mr Norman Davidson, FE district manager, added: ''Unless something is
done now the levels of damage will increase dramatically.''

<TEXT>
PLANS to re-introduce 200 wolves to the Highlands are running into
growing opposition, despite apparent backing from the European Union.
Scottish Environment Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, dismissed
the move in a Commons speech ahead of a heated public meeting on the
topic.
The plans, forwarded by the Highland Wolf Fund, originated in an EU
directive which ''allows member states to consider the desirability and
feasibility'' of re-introducing native species to their natural
habitats.
Highland wolves, species Canis Cupis, were killed off about 250 years
ago. The last animal was killed by a shepherd at Loth, in Sutherland.
During a Commons debate on controls on the buying and selling of
Scottish estates, Lord James said: ''Excessive regulation would be
inadvisable -- as inadvisable as the EC directive to bring back wolves
into Scotland.''
Even before last night's meeting started in Elgin's Moray College,
farming leaders went gunning for the wolf bid, describing it as
''totally lunatic''.
However, Oxford-based Dr Roger Panaman, of the fund, said
re-introducing wolves would help control an escalating deer population.
He proposed a compensation scheme for lost farm livestock.
More than 100 people gathered for the stormy debate in the college
last night.
Scottish NFU livestock convener Mr Stuart Whiteford, of Castlecraig
Farm, Nigg, Easter Ross, said yesterday: ''The wolf idea is crazy and we
aim to make it clear just how horrified we farmers are.''

CENTURIES of Highland depopulation is being reversed with more people
now living in the area than at any time in the past 70 years, one of the
Highlands' leading economists said last night.
Dr Ken MacTaggart, head of economics in Highlands and Islands
Enterprise, was addressing a business seminar in Inverness. He stressed
that some of the remoter areas were still suffering, but he could also
predict a new era of economic prosperity for the north and west.
He said that prior to the 1951 census, the traditional problem of
depopulation in the Highlands and Islands persisted. ''But about 1960
something remarkable happened. The decline of two centuries bottomed
out, and population growth resumed.
''The pace gathered during the 1970s oil boom and continued through
the 1980s. Latest estimates show this trend has continued strongly since
the 1991 census.
''There are now about 373,000 people living in the Highlands and
Islands, more than at any time since the 1920s. Some 50,000 people have
moved into the area since the 1961 upturn. That represents the
equivalent of a completely new town the size of Inverness plus its
satellites of Balloch, Culloden and the rest, emerging in the
Highlands.''
In the 1980s the population of Britain had been virtually static while
Scotland actually lost population up to 1988.
''Highland region has risen by more than 8%. The wider Highlands and
Islands' average growth is dragged down by continuing out-migration from
the islands, but it is still a healthy 4%. By European standards, this
is a very fast population growth, albeit from an initially low base. For
comparison, Netherlands is the fastest-growing European country, and it
manages 1% per decade.''
Dr MacTaggart said that the optimism had to be tempered by regional
variation. ''At one extreme, Inverness grew 11% through the 80s and Skye
an extraordinary 15%. But the other side of the story are the Western
Isles, which continue to lose people, down 6%.
''There is also population loss in Caithness, Lochaber, Argyll and
Shetland. The traditional Highlands and Islands malaise is by no means
solved.''
The improvements to the communications and transport infrastructure
had been unprecedented since Thomas Telford's days, he added. This had
helped attract people. But so had the low crime, absence of traffic
congestion, the environment, access to outdoor recreation, etc. These
had attracted the ''lifestyle immigrants''.
But Dr MacTaggart stressed: ''The people are returning not out of
sentiment, but for hard economic benefit. Some are coming for
employment, and others are setting up their own businesses for
self-employment. New industries are emerging to replace the old.
''The positive economic trend in the area is amply demonstrated by the
statistics. It is a trend well established now for 30 years, and it is
set to continue.''
To help deliver this era of prosperity he looked to the new western
oil fields which could help Highland ports take some of Aberdeen's
activity and have a spin-off for fabrication; to the opportunities
created by contractorisation of military bases; to knowledge or
information based industries using the area's advanced
telecommunications network, including a Highland University.

YOUNG people in care in Strathclyde now have their rights and
responsibilities enshrined in a colourful charter booklet.
The charter was launched yesterday by the region's social work
department when a group of young people who have recently been in care
demonstrated how they can ''learn the ropes'' by abseiling down the
walls of Glasgow Climbing Centre.
Councillor Mary Beckett, who chairs the child care sub-committee,
explained that the charter is the result of years of consultation with
young people in care, care staff and foster parents in Strathclyde, and
draws from a UN charter and study by the Scottish Office.
''Young people come into care when there has been a lot of upheaval in
their lives. It can be a bewildering time for them and it is important
that they know what their rights are and that these are written out as a
clear reference for them,'' she said.
Gillian Vinesky, who left care two years ago at the age of 18, said:
''When I was in care we didn't have a clue what our rights were. We may
have been told about children's panels but I had no idea that we could
have someone to help us have our say.''

A MOTHER and her daughter survived a crash yesterday which killed her
husband on the A75 Gretna-Stranraer Euro-route.
The man died as the family car was crushed by a piece of machinery
being carried by a lorry. The accident happened at the top of The Glen,
four miles west of Dumfries at an accident blackspot.
The man who died was named last night as Mr James Muir, a drystane
dyker from Balmaclellan, 12 miles north of Castle Douglas. His wife,
Heather, and four-year-old daughter, Toni, were being treated in
Dumfries Infirmary.
The couple also have twin daughters aged two who were being cared for
by family last night.
The accident involved an articulated lorry and the car. The lorry
overturned spilling part of its load and police and firefighters were
working on the theory that the heavy piece of machinery caused most of
the damage.
Mrs Muir managed to scramble to safety and pulled her daughter from
the wreckage. But her husband was found to be dead when paramedics
arrived on the scene.
The car finished up 10ft down an embankment in a small wood and the
lorry overturned with part of the trailer lying on the roadside and the
tractor unit and rest of the trailer also in the wood.
The lorry driver was only slightly injured.
The road was closed for several hours and diversions were set up at
Dumfries and Haugh of Urr.
A Dumfries Fire Brigade spokesman said: ''It was a horrible accident
and really a freak one. It appears that part of the machinery came off
and the car was crushed.
''When we arrived the mother and daughter were out of the wreckage. We
think she got out herself and then pulled her daughter out.''
A police spokesman said: ''Both appeared to be conscious and their
injuries are now being assessed. We are investigating the cause of the
accident. They were very lucky to get out although the man was not. He
must have died almost instantly.''
Councillors in Dumfries and Galloway have been campaigning to have the
road upgraded west from Dumfries past this stretch, which has claimed a
number of lives in the last few years.
Roads chairman Mr David Fulton said they were anxious for work to be
carried out and they were awaiting approval from the Scottish Office.
Villagers were shocked by the tragedy and Mr John Hall, husband of the
village postmistress at Balmaclellan, said: ''Everyone is devasted by
this tragedy. They were such a nice family and this had to happen to
them.

<HEADLINE>Furious home-owners may take legal action against town corporation after discovery.  Hundreds face asbestos danger</HEADLINE>

HUNDREDS of home-owners in East Kilbride may take legal action against
the local development corporation after the discovery of blue asbestos
inside their homes.
They are furious because the corporation, which built their homes in
the 60s, has refused to accept liability for the problem or pay for the
removal of the asbestos.
Residents in 306 properties in the Murray area of the town have been
officially warned not to ''scrape, drill, or otherwise break'' the
interior wall panels in their flats because of the danger.
However, the advice has come too late for many people who have already
carried out extensive renovation work to the interior of the flats,
built for letting in 1961 by the development corporation.
Plans are under way to remove the asbestos in 41 properties which are
still owned by the corporation, but the owners of 265 flats which are
privately owned have been told by the corporation they are on their own.
Mr John McLaughlin, the corporation's housing manager, said: ''We were
the original developers and builders 30 years ago and many of these
properties have been sold and resold.
''Our legal advice, as the original developers, is that they were
built in accordance with the regulations at the time. We don't believe
we have any liability.''
A proposal has been made by the district council to provide grants to
help with the removal. However, extra money will have to be provided by
the Scottish Office first and it will not cover all the costs.
Many residents are extremely concerned at the health risks they face
and the costs of removing the material which lines the inside of the
exterior walls.
They are to challenge the corporation's assertion that asbestos was
only discovered for the first time last month.
A number of residents have already contacted solicitors with a view to
taking the corporation to court and an action group has been formed to
coordinate the move.
Firefighter Mr Grant McKendrick, who lives with his wife Janice and
five-year-old son Stuart in Denholm Crescent, said: ''We have decorated
the flat three times and scraped right down to the walls. Of course I am
concerned about the implications of that.
''We have been told the asbestos is safe if it is covered with
wallpaper, yet I am a firefighter and there is no way we are allowed
near asbestos without breathing equipment and full protective gear.''
In common with many of their neighbours, Mr David Cornes and his wife
Yvonne have had extensive renovation work carried out on their home at
Denholm Crescent since they bought it from the corporation five years
ago.
''We recently had new bay windows installed in one of the walls,''
said Mrs Cornes. ''I swept up the piles of dust myself. Every flat has
had gas, water, and cable television services drilling through their
walls at some time. It is extremely worrying.
''They say asbestosis takes years to show up. There are families and
children being brought up in these flats.''
Mr Cornes and a number of residents are challenging the corporation's
assertion that asbestos was only discovered recently.
''Frankly we don't believe it. I have a copy of a builder's location
plan for the flats which clearly shows asbestos,'' he said.
He also claimed that the district council's environmental health
department warned the corporation of asbestos 12 years ago.
That was denied by the council's environmental services director Mr H.
Douglas Henry, who said: ''We certainly did not know there was asbestos
inside the houses. What everybody knew was that external panels on the
houses were asbestos board.''
Councillor Colin Robb, the leader of East Kilbride District Council
and depute chairman of the development corporation, said: ''The local
authority is highly sympathetic to the plight of the home-owners but I
don't know what else we can do. I think the corporation is clear in
their minds that there is no liability.''

UNIVERSITIES will have to turn to the markets to raise private
finances if they are to meet the cost of capital projects into the next
century, higher education representatives were told yesterday.
According to a recent report, the borrowing requirement for the sector
for such projects is more than #1000m, with about three-quarters of the
total needed for accommodation.
Paisley and Edinburgh universities have already been involved in
tentative discussions about setting up a UK consortium to raise up to
#100m on the capital markets.
The pressure for a rise in borrowing for capital projects has been
caused by the dramatic increase in student numbers.
Dr Kenneth Edwards, chairman of the body which represents UK
university chiefs, the CVCP, told a conference yesterday that capital
needs could not be completely met from public funds.
He said: ''The HE sector will require considerable borrowing from the
private sector . . . One condition is that institutions must be
reasonably assured of sufficient recurrent income to cover the costs of
repayment.''
Yet, he told the conference on private finance and higher education,
Government cuts in recurrent funding were making it more difficult to
cover the cost of borrowing.
In the five years to 1993/4 university income for tuition for each
student had been reduced in real terms by 26%.
Looking at the HE funding issue in general, he outlined CVCP's view
that some form of contribution from students towards the cost of their
tuition would be necessary.
Any tuition fee scheme should not deter students from going on to
higher education; should generate enough money for teaching and
maintaining students to allow them to conentrate on their studies; be
simple and cheap to administer; and should raise money on top of
Government funding.

THE Queen came the closest yet to the new South Africa yesterday when
she visited the sprawling black township of Soweto, scene of racial
violence during the Apartheid era.
She met the future of the fledgling democratic state in a hospital
maternity ward -- but four-day-old Caswell Hilton Mavunda slept through
his audience with the Queen.
Caswell will go home to one room in a small house with no running
water or lavatory.
His mother, Molly Mavunda, 21, fears she will not be able to send her
son to school because the family does not earn enough money.
Caswell's 25-year-old father Harry is lucky to have a job which allows
them to rent the room in a three-roomed brick-built house in Diepkloof,
a relatively prosperous area of Soweto.
The Queen visited Soweto's Baragwanath Hospital during her state visit
of South Africa.
Nursing staff and other mothers on the maternity ward were singing a
traditional African song, Thembaland, which translated means ''My
Hope''.
The reality is that for many hope is all there is to cling to.
The 3200-bed hospital, the largest in the southern hemisphere, caters
for more than four million people living in Soweto and its surrounding
squatter camps.
Some houses are just habitable. Others are little more than tin
shacks. Unemployment is rife and crime has taken hold.
Soweto, an acronym for ''South Western Townships'', was the scene of
large-scale violence during the 1970s.
The black township covers more than 30 square miles and its population
is bigger than Birmingham's.
Earlier at Soweto's Avalon cemetery, the Queen and President Nelson
Mandela unveiled a monument to the 656 South African soldiers who died
when the SS Mendi sank off the Isle of Wight during the First World War.
It had taken 78 years, since the sinking of the troopship, for the
dead to be honoured in the country of their birth.
President Mandela said: ''For the Queen to come here is a source of
great inspiration for us.
''These men who went down are our heroes. Naturally, it is long
overdue, but it is the crowning recognition of their contribution.''
With the Duke of Edinburgh, she then inspected a guard of honour made
up of Second World War veterans proudly wearing their British campaign
medals.
The Queen also visited the Self-Help Association for paraplegics in
Soweto where she met Friday Mavuso who set up the organisation.
Mr Mavuso was paralysed in 1974 when he was shot by drunken police
officers. He won a 75,000 rand (#15,000) compensation pay-out and used
the money to start the centre.
The Royal visitors watched wheelchair basketball and coaching clinics
at an athletics track funded through the United Kingdom-South Africa
Sports Initiative, established by Prime Minister John Major on a visit
last year.
At a lunch hosted by Gauteng province Premier Tokyo Sexwale at Midrand
near Johannesburg, the Queen said it was clear that South Africa's
leaders were undaunted by the challenges posed in founding a new
democracy.
''It was reassuring to see that the disadvantaged and the sick are
going to be looked after as the country strides on into its new and
exciting future,'' she said.

THE Church of Scotland went to court yesterday to reassert the right
to run its own affairs and to resist interference from the highest civil
court in the land.
The Church's counsel, Mr Alastair Dunlop QC, argued that it derived
its ultimate authority from Jesus, not Parliament, and was not subject
to the jurisdiction of the Court of Session in spiritual matters.
Mr Dunlop was challenging an order granted at the Court of Session
last week against Dumbarton Presbytery.
The interim interdict by Lord Osborne in favour of the Rev Tom Logan,
of Abbotsford Manse, Clydebank, overturned a decision by the presbytery
to suspend Mr Logan from his work in the parish pending a church
disciplinary hearing on April 19.
The Church was not represented at last week's hearing at which the
judge was told that Mr Logan was in dispute with the Church over his
activities as an agent for Amway, a company which specialises in soap
products and recruiting agents. After some complaints Mr Logan was
interviewed by his presbytery which decided his Amway activities were
incompatible with his work as a minister.
Mr Logan petitioned last year's General Assembly which decided by 630
votes to 13 that the presbytery had been right. After further
complaints, the presbytery decided to put Mr Logan on trial under the
Kirk's own procedures.
Last Wednesday he was suspended on full pay and his trial set down for
a hearing on April 19 and 20.
Last Friday, however, Lord Osborne said he was satisfied that Mr Logan
had made out an arguable case for freezing the suspension. He heard
arguments that the suspension was in breach of natural justice because
the minister had not been given a proper opportunity to put his side of
the story and was never given formal notice of the case against him.
Mr Dunlop, the procurator to the General Assembly, told the court
yesterday that the background to the case was that under the laws of the
church a minister had to obtain the approval of the presbytery before
becoming involved in a business. The allegation was that Dumbarton
Presbytery had refused him permission, but that he had gone ahead.
The charge against him was one of contempt of the decision of the
presbytery. Mr Dunlop asked Lord Osborne to recall last week's court
order and, in effect, reimpose the suspension pending the April 19
hearing.
He argued that, according to the 1921 Church of Scotland Act the Court
of Session had no jurisdiction to deal with Mr Logan's complaints, which
fell within the exclusive authority of the ecclesiastical courts.
''This is a fairly fundamental point and one of considerable
constitutional importance for the church,'' added Mr Dunlop.
The Church had all along asserted that its jurisdiction to deal with
spiritual matters did not come from the State but from Jesus Christ. The
1921 Act was a recognition by Parliament that the church's claims in
that regard were correct.
The Church was a separate, distinct and supreme jurisdiction, and
within the spiritual sphere was as supreme as the Court of Session was
in civil matters. Mr Dunlop said the law and practice of the Church
required the observance of the laws of natural justice.
Mr Iain Bonomy QC, counsel for Mr Logan, argued that the remedy of
judicial review was open to challenge a decision that amounted to an
abuse or excess of power or a failure to perform a duty that had been
delegated or entrusted.
''My submission is that the power and position of the Church stems
from Parliament and not from the Lord Jesus Christ. My argument is that
when Parliament provides the Church's authority and jurisdiction then
the Church is subject to judicial review.''
In this case, the argument was that the procedures followed by the
Church were fundamentally null and void from the outset, amounted to a
denial of natural justice and could be reviewed in the Court of Session.
Lord Osborne will give a written decision later.
Stewart Lamont writes: Should the judge find against the Church of
Scotland when he issues his written opinion it will lead to a vigorously
contested action, which could undermine the status of the Kirk as the
national Church.
Whether or not Mr Logan's trial will go ahead as planned remains in
doubt.
Last night the presbytery was considering its options but its
officials are known to be concerned to do nothing which appears to imply
acceptance of Court of Session jurisdiction over the Kirk.

<TEXT>
AFTER a row with his boss a construction site digger driver worked all
day at the controls of his excavator, wearing a dunce's cap.
An industrial tribunal at Inverness heard this yesterday when it
upheld Mr Andrew Scobie's claim of unfair dismissal.
The tribunal heard that Mr Scobie, 39, was demoted to a smaller digger
for ''his general awkwardness and lack of productivity'' while working
for an Easter Ross civil engineering and plant contracting firm.
So, to take the mickey out of his boss, Mr Alastair MacKay, he wore
the party hat dunce's cap for the rest of the day during work on the
Morar bypass in west Inverness-shire.
A later confrontation between the company head and the digger driver,
while working on the approach road to the Skye Bridge, ended with Mr
Scobie, of Station Road, Edderton, walking off the site.
Mr Scobie claimed that Mr Mackay told him to ''get the f . . . home
and out of my sight''.
Mr MacKay agreed that he might have sworn at his awkward employee, but
said he would not have told him to go home.
This sparked off a debate as to whether, in a building site
environment, being sworn at by the boss and told to get out of his sight
really meant he was sacking you.
Mr Scobie said: ''I certainly took it as the sack. My home was 80
miles away.''
The tribunal will give the reasons behind its decision in a few weeks.
Mr Scobie, who now works for another contractor, was unavailable for
comment.

MORE than 200 jobs could be created at the Caledonian Paper mill in
Irvine if management wins its bid for further investment from its parent
company.
It emerged yesterday that discussions are taking place with Kymmene of
Finland with a view to creating a second production line at the plant on
the Ayrshire coast.
Although discussions are at an early and delicate stage, managers at
Caledonian are reported to be ''hopeful and quietly confident'' that the
investment of around #200m can be won.
Caledonian will have to compete with three other group companies for
the necessary cash.
The mill, which opened in 1989 and is the only producer of
lightweight-coated paper in the UK, yesterday produced its one millionth
tonne which was handed over to regular customer Mr Ian Cooper, of Cooper
Clegg Printing in Tewkesbury, by Kymmene chief executive Mr Harry Piehl.
Caledonian Paper became Scotland's largest inward investment when it
was set up at a cost of #220m.
Manufactured output has risen to more than 205,000 tonnes a year,
turnover to #100m, and the company is expected to record a profit this
year for the first time.
Mr David Mackie, marketing director, said: ''We are very proud of the
achievement here in Irvine and today is a milestone for us and for the
UK paper industry as a whole.
''This mill is now working to capacity and high on our agenda is a
second production line with a resulting increase of around 50% on the
current workforce.''

THE West Lothian food poisoning incident has now gone into the records
as the largest milk-borne E-coli outbreak recorded in the world.
Its human toll was devastating. It claimed the life of an 18-month-old
girl, Claire Davison, and damaged the kidneys of six other children, who
had to endure the extended trauma of dialysis. Two are still on
dialysis, awaiting transplants.
A total of 69 people were struck down. Civil suits on behalf of the
families concerned are now certain to follow.
All Scottish milk has been heat-treated since 1983. Pasteurisation
kills off the E-coli 0157 along with other pathogens such as salmonella
and campylobacter. However, the Redhouse Dairy tragedy serves to
underline what can go terribly wrong after that process has been carried
out.
Samples taken from a pipe leading to the bottling machine and a rubber
seal both showed the presence of the bacteria. Traces were also
discovered in cattle faeces from one of the 17 farms supplying the dairy
and in a bulk tanker of raw milk from one of the dairy's suppliers.
E-coli is found in the guts of cattle and in human carriers who show
no outward signs of illness. However, the tiniest measure can be fatal
among the frail, elderly or very young, in amounts scarcely detectable
in a hospital laboratory.
Mr Bill Reilly, consultant in veterinary public health at the Scottish
Centre for Infection and Environmental Health, said: ''In terms of
overall milk consumption this is a problem that should not concern the
consumer. You need to have an unfortunate combination of circumstances
to allow an episode such as this to occur.
''As far as we are aware, this is the first milk-borne outbreak in
Scotland and the largest reported milk-borne outbreak in the world.
''This organism is usually destroyed by pasteurisation. When it is
implicated in food, it indicates that there has been contamination in
the food as a result of failure of hygienic practices.''
Mr Reilly said it was not enough simply to carry out pasteurisation.
''The organism can survive in the bottling plant if it is not monitored
during the entire process and there is no proper disinfection.''
There was a record number of E-coli cases in Scotland last year, but
this was largely due to the West Lothian outbreak.
At the time of its discovery last May there was a rancorous exchange
between West Lothian District Council and Lothian Health Board over the
timing of warnings to the public. Those differences of opinion were
played down yesterday by both sides.
Dr John Baynham, chairman of Lothian Health Board, said the verdict
and sentence vindicated the findings of the Outbreak Control Team of
health board, district council and hospital laboratory officials.
''The outcome of this investigation shows the benefits of close
co-operation and good working relationships between the organisations
involved,'' he said.
''The main lesson to be learned for the future is that you cannot
always assume that pasteurisation equipment will always work. It must be
regularly monitored to a high standard to ensure that bacteria are
cleared.''

THE owners of a West Lothian dairy, thought to be the source of a
fatal food poisoning outbreak, were yesterday fined #2000 after being
convicted of producing milk contaminated with deadly E-coli bacteria.
The couple later said they planned to appeal against the decision at
Linlithgow Sheriff Court.
Mrs Margaret Haston, a mother-of-four, said she and husband Robert,
42, owners of Redhouse Dairy in Blackburn, were ''disappointed'' with
the verdict.
Speaking from her home next to the dairy, she said: ''I'm disappointed
the sheriff did not give us reasons why he found us guilty.''
The dairy has not produced milk since May 1994, when the local council
placed a prohibition order on the premises, banning the use of all
equipment.
Mrs Haston, 40, said she was unable to comment further because of the
planned appeal.
The couple had denied three charges of supplying milk unfit for human
consumption by being contaminated with the E-coli 0157 bacteria.
Eighteen-month-old Claire Davison, of Bathgate, died during the
outbreak which affected 69 people in West Lothian in May and June last
year.
During the trial, the court was told that traces of the deadly
bacteria were found in a pipe and a rubber seal at the dairy.
More than 90% of those affected by the virus were said to have
consumed milk from the dairy.
The couple had to wait a month to learn their fate, after Sheriff John
Young said he would need time to consider his verdict at the end of the
five-day trial in February.
Finding the couple guilty of all charges, Sheriff Young told them: ''I
am of the view the strands of evidence came together to provide ample
sufficiency to support the charges.''
Defending, Mr Pat Wheatley said: ''There is nothing in any of the
evidence which came out that in any way gives an indication to me, or
the accused, that there was something done by them that they should not
have done that resulted in this matter being established to my lord's
satisfaction.''
Mr Wheatley revealed that the couple were surviving on #120 a week,
the proceeds of distributing milk on behalf of other dairies. This part
of the business would continue, said the lawyer.
Sheriff Young fined the couple #1000 each and ordered them to pay the
fines at #10 per week.
After the hearing relatives of those affected by the virus said they
were pleased by the outcome.
Mr Charles Reilly, of Livingston, whose three-year-old grandson
Michael underwent kidney dialysis after being infected by the bacteria,
said the youngster was now waiting for a transplant.
He described the last year as ''absolute hell'' for the family.
''The outbreak should not have happened in this day and age. I don't
honestly care about the fine, if they had been fined #1 it wouldn't have
mattered,'' he said.
Mr Kenneth Armit, also from Livingston, whose four-year-old son Ryan
was given the all-clear from the infection this week, said: ''I'm quite
happy with what they got because they were found guilty, but it still
should not have happened.''
The sheriff's verdict was also welcomed by the chairman of West
Lothian District Council's environmental health and leisure committee.
Councillor Peter Johnston said: ''Nothing can bring a child back to
life, or end the suffering of the many families in West Lothian affected
by the tragedy. But at least this verdict confirms our long-held view
that the dairy was the source of the outbreak.
''Dairy and food producers must take every possible step to ensure the
safety of their products.''
Lawyers representing those who were affected by the bacteria have set
up a joint action group and may bring a test case for damages against
the dairy owners.
Mr Reilly later said the family were considering suing the Hastons for
damages in a separate action.

EVERYONE in the room knew what he was going to say, but it didn't take
the sting out of Mr Garth Cruickshank's announcement: ''It is my sad
duty to inform you that Davie Cooper died this morning.''
He said the footballer never regained consciousness. ''He would not be
aware at any point of what was going on.''
A consultant neurosurgeon, Mr Cruickshank took charge of Davie
Cooper's case when he was admitted to the Institute for Neurological
Sciences at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow on Wednesday.
The hospital had to set up a special phone line to handle the hundreds
of inquiries and calls from well-wishers anxious about the football
player's condition.
But even as the calls, and faxes, were pouring in it was already clear
that the popular sportsman's life was rapidly ebbing.
Within a few hours of admission Mr Cruickshank had to tell his family
and his fiancee, Elizabeth Thomson, that his chances of survival were
slim. Yesterday morning he had to prepare them for the formalities of
death.
At 9.45 he and a colleague, a consultant anaesthetist, carried out the
examination which confirmed that Davie Cooper was brain dead. At ten
o'clock they switched off his life support system, and a man who had to
all appearances been a fit and healthy athlete less than 24 hours
previously, breathed his last.
Mr Cruickshank said that after Cooper collapsed on Wednesday morning,
a CT scan performed at Monklands Hospital confirmed he had suffered a
subarachnoid haemorrhage: bleeding between the membranes lining the
brain.
The doctors' priorities when he was wheeled into the Institute were to
confirm this and establish if there was anything needing treatment that
they could offer, like signs of brain swelling or impaired circulation
to the brain. Further scans confirmed both.
They tried to deal with this initially by sedating him and controlling
the blood pressure to improve the supply of blood to his brain.
These efforts continued, but it became clear about 10pm that he was
losing all neurological activity. Sedation was stopped so that he was
clear of any drugs or other agents that were likely to interfere with
the doctors' assessment of his condition. His condition deteriorated
seriously overnight.
''Initially when he came in there were some signs of neurological
activity but progressively through the night these signs went. They
fitted very well with the CT scan picture which showed a very serious
bleed and very serious problems going on inside his head,'' Mr
Cruickshank explained.
The most likely cause of the bleed, he said, would be rupture of an
aneurysm, a swelling of one of the blood vessels inside the head. That
is the most common cause of a subarachnoid haemorrhage.
''In these sorts of patients about 30% die immediately and the rest
survive and get to a unit such as this where we can help them.
''In David's case he had such a massive haemorrhage associated with a
seizure -- he suffered one when he collapsed and another at Monklands
hospital which aggravated the swelling -- I think the pathological state
he had got into was a natural consequence of the bleed.
''This is a completely silent disease. You have no knowledge it is
going to occur and there is usually no warning that it is going to
occur.''
The incidence of this disorder is put at eight per 100,000 population.
In the Institute's catchment area, the number who make it there alive
is in the order of 200 people a year.
''Of these we are able to operate on about 160,'' said Mr Cruickshank.
''But from the start that was never an option for Davie Cooper.''
''He never regained consciousness after he collapsed. He would not be
aware at any point of what was going on.''
Subarachnoid haemorrhage happened equally to fit healthy sportsmen as
it did any other member of the population.
''They usually occur in the spaces between the bony part of the skull
and the brain where the blood vessels have to traverse the spaces: these
are the major branches of the carotid arteries.
''It is at these junctions where the branches occur that these
aneurysms develop -- imagine a hose pipe that gets a very thin area of
wall and balloons out. At some time or other the pressure causes the
wall to give and it will burst.
''The bleed you see in the scan is round the brain and in all the
fissures and spaces round the brain rather than in the brain substance
itself.''
There was no evidence that the impact of footballers' regular
head-contact with the ball made them more prone to haemorrhages, he
added.
The fact that someone like Davie Cooper could keel over and die so
abruptly is bound to make anyone wonder if they, too, have a cerebral
aneurysm lurking inside them.
Some people are luckier: they have a slower bleed which produces
symptoms, like blinding headaches, which will bring them to the notice
of specialists.
Or they may have other indications which merit specific investigation,
such as a family history of the same problem, or a known deficiency of
collagen, the body's principal structural protein.
In fact looking for aneurysms in such cases is the bread-and-butter of
the Institute's neuroradiology department, the consultant in charge, Dr
Donald Hadley, said yesterday.
''If you can get it clipped, you can return to a normal life,'' he
said. They saw several every day, ''but you can't screen the entire
population.''
Apart from the practical difficulties, one reason is that the
examination, an angiogram, is invasive -- a catheter 1mm wide is
inserted from the thigh through each in turn of the four great arteries
serving the brain, and a tracing medium squirted from the tip to make
its way through the rest of the brain's circulation.
This allows a series of rapid-fire X-rays from different angles to
build up a map of the circulation, allowing the radiologists to spot any
untoward bulges.
Within a few years, says Dr Hadley, the non-invasive, non-radioactive
MRI scanner may provide a safer way of getting the same information, but
that technique is not yet proven.
The established course when an aneurysm is spotted is for surgeons to
open the skull and clip the affected vessel to forestall any
haemorrhage; increasingly, and in particular where the problem is
inaccessible, catheters are being used to insert tiny platinum clips
around the aneurysm, building them up so that the weak spot is blocked
off.
''This technique is proven for areas the surgeons can't get at.
Whether it is better in all cases is now the subject of international
trials involving thousands of patients,'' said Dr Hadley. ''But unless
there is something to indicate the condition in the first place, it is
down to luck whether or not it bursts.''

NEIGHBOURS, as Mr Tony Blair pointed out on Wednesday, do not always
become good friends. They can be noisy, violent, their children can get
up to mischief or even, as Mr Blair said, ''worse'' and go joyriding in
your car.
As if taking its cue from his address, much of Prime Minister's
Questions touched on matters relating to neighbours, friendship and
responsibility.
Sir Teddy Taylor (Southend East -- Con.) does not trust Britain's
neighbours to keep their neighbours not just out of their own back
garden but ours. The way he sees it, it's like allowing your next-door
neighbour to decide who can come calling to your back garden.
Mr Major agreed with him pretty warmly, and said he had already given
the neighbours a piece of his mind about this and that, though he
thought they took his point, he would take ''whatever steps are
necessary'' to ensure that a UK citizen's home remains his castle.
Sir Teddy might have preferred more specific steps but had to be
satisfied with ''whatever''.
One back garden where Mr Major is always welcome, the scene of many a
fine summer afternoon party, is that of the Old Rectory, home of his
friend Lord Archer.
Mr Dale Campbell-Savours (Workington -- Lab.), who doesn't rate an
invite and wouldn't go if he did, said the rules of the Commons did not
allow him to raise aspects of the trading activities of ''your friend''
Lord Archer. However, in the light of the repeated failure by the
authorities to prosecute successfully insider trading offences, should
not the law be reviewed?
Mr Major might have been expected to advise Mr Campbell-Savours to
produce evidence if he had any rather than peddling smears.
Instead he declared: ''I am happy to confirm that Lord Archer is my
friend, has been my friend and will remain my friend in the future'',
and it was up to the Law Officers to decide if the law needed reviewing.
Unfortunately, addressed to an audience of politicians and journalists
who, at least collectively, are prone to suspect the worst, this simple
declaration of friendship had much the same impact as Mark Antony's
''Brutus is an honourable man'' speech had on the Roman mob.
There was much buzzing about what this could mean, the plain and
obvious meaning being too simple for such a sophisticated audience.
Despite what increasingly looks like a muscular Christian approach to
social problems by the Labour leader, he might not be quite ready to
join hands with Mrs Elizabeth Peacock (Batley and Spen -- Con.), who has
suggested that the national desire for justice could be satisfied at
almost the same time as the national curiosity if some of those
convicted of crimes of ''mindless violence'' were to be flogged on
television during the draw for the National Lottery.
She did not specify this venue yesterday, but referred the Prime
Minister to the ''massive support'' in the country for the
reintroduction of corporal punishment.
Some Tories are keen on forcing the BBC to take advertising. They
might be quite happy to pay for an opening advert ''This Lottery and
corporal punishment display has been brought to you by the Conservative
Party''.
Mr Major cautiously replied that there were ''many measures'' that
could be taken to deal with crime, leaving open a wide range of
possibilities from beheading to a slap on the wrist.
It fell to Sir Anthony Durant (Reading West -- Con.) to point out that
most of the legislation of recent years designed to punish the
irresponsible members of the community so sternly rebuked by Mr Blair
the day before had been opposed by the Labour Party, led into the
lobbies on occasion by one Anthony Blair when Shadow Home Secretary.
Unsurprisingly, Mr Major agreed. They talk tough, he said, but when it
came to doing something about crime Labour voted the wrong way. The kind
of behaviour, in fact, which you could almost call irresponsible.

THE Prime Minister confirmed yesterday that the future of the Royal
Yacht is still uncertain -- despite its current use in the Queen's visit
to South Africa.
Tory MP Toby Jessel (Twickenham) had asked to Tory cheers: ''In view
of the tremendous success of the Queen's visit to South Africa and her
impressive arrival in HMS Britannia, would you agree that Britain should
continue to have a Royal Yacht?''
Agreeing that it had been a ''remarkably successful visit,'' Mr Major
would say only on the future of Britannia: ''The question of the Royal
Yacht is under consideration.''
Britannia is due to be retired in 1997 as the #17m cost of a refit is
considered too high.
A campaign for a replacement vessel is under way. One scheme being
suggested is for businessmen to pay towards the construction costs in
return for use of it on occasions as a sales platform.

THE demise of Edinburgh's Powderhall Stadium as a greyhound track and
the home of the Monarchs speedway team looks certain to become the
subject of an intensive campaign.
A group of people involved in both sports got together in a social
club only yards from the stadium last night and formed The Action Group
to Save Powderhall Stadium.
Among those present was Mr David Welsh, chairman of the Powderhall Dog
Owners' Association, who declined to disclose anything about the group's
strategy at this stage.
However, it is understood that the group will try to emulate the
success of the ''Hands Off Hibs'' campaign five years ago.
Powderhall now belongs to a newly-formed offshoot of the English
property company, Charlotte Twenty-One Ltd, and it has been made clear
that greyhounds will never run there again. The Monarchs expect to
remain there for the coming season, but it is understood that there are
no plans for them to continue at the stadium longer than that.
According to joint-receivers called in to arrange the sale of the
stadium, which has been operated for the past four years by the Scottish
Greyhound Racing Company, headed by Mr Eddie Ramsay, it fetched #3.3m.
It is understood that the new owners intend to develop the stadium as
an office, shops or other purely commercial site.

THE word ''amateurism'' no longer describes what is going on in rugby
union, the secretary of the Rugby Football Union, Mr Dudley Wood, told
MPs yesterday.
However, he strongly denied that direct payments for playing --
so-called ''boot money'' -- were made to players either at the top level
or through their clubs, and he strongly defended the non-professional
status of the game.
Mr Wood was giving evidence to the Commons National Heritage
Committee, which is conducting an investigation into the relationship
between rugby league and rugby union. However, its main purpose is to
look at the alleged ''shamateurism'' in rugby union.
The RFU chairman faced some tough questioning from MPs, who are
concerned that the strictly amateur status of rugby union is being
compromised. He said: ''Amateurism is out-dated and does not describe
the current position. That disappeared when it was made possible to pay
expenses.''
However, the situation was far from full professionalism.
Mr Wood told the MPs: ''We have yet to find a word for it. It is still
a sport for those involved in full-time occupations, even at the highest
level.''
Much attention focused on England captain Will Carling and the
question of his earnings outside the game.
Committee chairman Gerald Kaufman said to Mr Wood: ''It is mildly
conceivable that he loves the game because it provides him with a source
of income.''
Mr Wood: ''I think he would still play the game for the love of it,
but yes, he has been able to turn his skill at the game to financial
advantage.''
However, everything was being done under the rules laid down by the
International Rugby Board, which allows players, in certain
circumstances, to earn money through, for example, opening supermarkets
and personal appearances.
Labour MP John Maxton (Glasgow Cathcart) challenged Mr Wood: ''Rugby
union is rapidly moving to be a professional sport, if it is not
already.''
Mr Wood: ''What is amateur? In England, we have 375,000 players and as
far as I am aware all of them play for the love of the game and not for
financial reward.''
Mr Maxton: ''Are you telling me that Will Carling does not earn his
living basically from rugby?''
Mr Wood: ''I am certainly telling you that. We pay him nothing at all
and his club pay him nothing at all.''
Mr Maxton: ''Do you believe he earns his living from being a top-class
rugby player?''
Mr Wood: ''He runs a business and he earns from that. The fact that
his fame helps him is true, but what right have we to stop someone using
his success outside the game.''
Mr Wood was adamant that the RFU played it by the book. Top players
received legitimate expenses, such as for travel, loss of earnings when
on foreign trips, and medical costs, but were not directly paid to play.
If that happened, it would change the whole nature of the game.
Earlier, representatives from the armed forces were questoned by the
committee on the rules governing serving officers who play rugby at the
highest level, such as England's Tim Rodber and Rory Underwood, and
Scotland's Rob Wainwright.
The representatives from the Services insisted that duty came first
and that players only were given leave to play with permission from
their commanding officers.

Brussels
BRITAIN faces a battle with the European Commission to keep its
passport controls for internal EU travellers.
The Commissioner in charge of the European single market, Mr Mario
Monti, announced that plans for the removal of all EU internal border
checks were in the pipeline. ''The time for this has come,'' he told the
European Parliament, a statement which seemed to put pressure on
Britain.
Mr Major was equally adamant in his resistance. He insisted that
changes at UK immigration points were ''unacceptable''.
Mr Major had been challenged in the Commons by the unofficial leader
of the whipless Tory Euro rebels, Sir Teddy Taylor. The Prime Minister
said Britain's frontier regulations were not something to bargain over.
''Any change to our frontier controls is unacceptable and our European
partners know that is the position,'' he declared.
''I will continue to take whatever steps are necessary to maintain
them. If at some stage they were to come under risk, and if it became
necessary to seek a treaty amendment, then of course I would do so.''
However, Mr Monti said his proposals were ''pretty much ready now'',
and merely required Commission ratification before being sent to the
Council of Ministers.
Seven EU member states were already making last-minute preparations
for Sunday's removal of internal borders in line with the so-called
Schengen Agreement, named after the Luxembourg town where it was signed.
Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany, Spain, and Portugal
have joined together in a fast-lane route to removing internal borders,
causing alarm in the UK Government.
The possibility now arises that EU citizens, mainly British, Irish and
Danish, travelling within the EU and not covered by Schengen could find
themselves facing new obstructions at immigrations points. It seems
likely they will have to join special airport and port channels for EU
visitors from non-Schengen member states or else be treated as
non-European travellers.
However, Mr Monti, in his first diplomatic test, appeared at pains not
to upset the British Government. He said the new system would not be
introduced until external border controls, where arriving non-EU
nationals are checked, are tightened.
This is unlikely to satisfy the Tory Euro-sceptics who have talked in
stark terms of millions of illegal immigrants flooding into the UK by
the European back door. Junior Minister Charles Wardle resigned on the
issue earlier this year.
Mr Monti said he would introduce three directives. The first and
second, covering removal of controls and checks on non-EU visitors
respectively, would be subject to unanimity in the Council: which means
Britain will have a veto.
There appeared little conviction among Commission officials that the
declaration demanded by the UK several years ago when the single market
was set up, a form of words allowing EU countries to invoke national
security when retaining borders, held much water.
Mr Monti avoided questions about the declaration, which Mr Major
insists is valid, but an aide later told The Herald: ''We are not
talking of an opt-out as a possibility.''
Mr Glyn Ford, a senior Labour Euro-MP, took a noticeably warmer line
towards the Commission's plans than the party leadership in Westminster.
''We agreed 10 years ago to move forward on this and now things are
moving''
This conflicts with the views of Mr Jack Straw, Shadow home affairs
spokesman, who has been anxious to take a tough line in order to
outflank the Home Secretary, Mr Michael Howard, who insists that borders
involve British sovereignty and must not be a matter for Brussels.
The new EU entrants, Austria, Finland and Sweden, are expected to join
Schengen eventually, as is Denmark, leaving Britain with only Ireland
for company.

THE number of cases involving bail offenders has soared from 4071 in
1985 to 26,594 in 1994, the Scottish Office told MPs yesterday, as it
defended provisions of the new Scottish Criminal Justice Bill.
Lord James Douglas Hamilton said the six-fold increase justifies
tougher measures. The Bill will allow the courts to impose longer
sentences for offences committed while on bail.
Speaking in the Commons Standing Committee considering the Bill, Lord
James said it was designed to address public and police concern over
bail offenders. ''This is a very substantive problem which needs to be
addressed and that's what we intend to do.''
Although Labour supports the new provisions, Home Affairs spokesman
John McFall said bail offending, particularly by young people, needed to
be addressed as part of a wider effort to end the log-jam in the courts.
''Every day in Scottish courts we are confronted with 100 cases where
people break their bail. It illustrates the ineffectiveness of the
courts and reflects badly on our criminal justice system. The scales of
justice are heavily lop-sided,'' he said.
Renfrew West and Inverclyde MP Tommy Graham told Lord James that
economic deprivation caused by the Government was to blame for the
problem. ''Bail has become a necessity because the Government absolutely
failed to recognise the root cause of crime. If they don't recognise
that unemployment does contribute to crime they're half daft.''
The Law Society for Scotland objects to the new measures, which also
increase the fine for bail offending to #1000. In its briefing to MPs on
the Bill, it warns that ''convicted persons will undoubtedly serve
longer sentences. This will have an effect of overcrowding prisons.''

<TEXT>
MILITANT councillor Tommy Sheridan was sent for trial yesterday
accused of breach of the peace at the M77 site in Glasgow.
But the 31-year-old Scottish Labour Militant convener won a minor
court battle by getting part of his bail restrictions withdrawn.
Eleven of the others arrested along with Mr Sheridan were forbidden to
approach the M77 site pending their trials.
But Mr Alan Miller, defending, told Glasgow Sheriff Court that part of
Mr Sheridan's duties as local councillor was to liaise with the roadway
contractors and the police.
''If he is not allowed to approach the scene he will be unable to
carry out his duties which include the safety of his constituents,'' he
said.
Mr Miller added: ''It was while trying to intervene after some people
were injured that he himself was arrested.''
The Crown then withdrew part of the special bail conditions which
would have prevented Mr Sheridan approaching the site on the south side
of Glasgow.
Mr Sheridan denies that on Wednesday in Pollok Park, Glasgow, he
formed part of a disorderly crowd and repeatedly attempted to push
through a cordon of police officers.
The charge states he moved into an area where tree felling was in
progress and shouted : ''Get the f . . . back,'' and committed a breach
of the peace.
Sheriff Alexander Wilkinson, QC, set trial for May 17.
The others arrested at the scene, who appeared in court, all pleaded
not guilty and were allowed bail pending trials in May and September.

THE IRA will not permit Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, on his return
from President Clinton's St Patrick's Day fiesta in Washington, to sign
up for serious weapons hand-over talks with the Government.
Last night, the party was still quibbling about correspondence with
the negotiating Northern Ireland Office Minister, Mr Michael Ancram.
The loyalist paramilitaries have already met Mr Ancram for exploratory
talks on a plan for decommissioning weapons.
Mr Clinton had expected Mr Adams to deliver the IRA by now into the
same commitment: serious talks about decommissioning weapons to allow
the peace process to continue.
Sinn Fein's negotiator, Mr Martin McGuinness, has responded to the
Government's agenda paper for exploratory talks, which are designed to
lead on to political negotiations with all Northern Ireland parties.
However, his reply is unsatisfactory. Mr Ancram has responded suggesting
another form of words which might bring Sinn Fein into talks with him
next week.
The Government was insisting that Mr McGuinness has not yet gone far
enough, in writing, towards a positive commitment to handing over Semtex
explosives, ground-to-air missiles, and other heavy offensive weapons.
Without this commitment, Mr Major and his Northern Ireland Ministers
will not move further. Sinn Fein representatives will not be allowed to
meet Mr Ancram until they deliver this commitment.
There was a further snag in the response: the inclusion of the word
demilitarisation. The Government made clear that there was no question
of a ''pull-out'' of troops being included in talks.
A statement from Downing Street last night, said: ''We do not accept
that the British Army should be put on the same level of moral
equivalence as paramilitary organisations.''
A letter was sent yesterday to Mr McGuinness making this clear. Behind
the scenes, the Government is telling Sinn Fein/IRA that if they insist
on a specious demand that the British Army in Ulster should be
''demilitarised'', the same should apply to the army of the Irish
Republic.
This is not intended to be a serious negotiating point, but it
illustrates the hard-line attitude of the Prime Minister and his
Northern Ireland Ministers, to the opening written response from Sinn
Fein on the key question of the decommissioning of weapons on all sides.
The sticking point has been reached. No talks can now take place
between Mr McGuinness and Mr Ancram until the British Government,
supported by Irish Premier John Bruton, has achieved a firm written
commitment to relinquishing offensive weapons.
The Ulster Unionists, who are watching and waiting, last night claimed
a local election triumph in Bangor West, North Down, where the party's
candidate, Mrs Marion Smith, polled 1752 votes, against the Alliance
Party's 1488, with the Conservatives a poor third on 261 votes.
The Ulster Unionists were claiming this as a reflection of Northern
Ireland voters' feelings towards the framework document for the
political future of the province.

THE Defend Clause 4 campaign yesterday launched a bulletin containing
a detailed critique of Mr Tony Blair's replacement clause, and said that
100,000 copies would be sent out in the next week to party members.
Mr Patrick Sikorski, RMT executive member, told a news conference his
union would oppose the new clause.
''Rail workers and rail users want to see the railways renationalised
under a Labour Government. We do not believe equality of opportunity and
a just society can be realised without an extension of public
ownership,'' he said.
He warned RMT-sponsored MPs, including John Prescott, Robin Cook and
Donald Dewar, that they could not expect to continue to receive support
from the RMT while opposing its policies.

THE Cabinet yesterday abandoned the idea of privatising the Post
Office in the lifetime of this Parliament.
A threatened rebellion by Tory MPs killed off the plan last year and
with an even smaller Commons majority now and opposition as strong as
ever -- especially from MPs in rural areas -- Ministers agreed that they
faced defeat if they tried.
It is doubtful if the privatisation even will feature in the
Conservative manifesto at the next General Election.
However, Ministers agreed at a much earlier date than usual the core
of the Government's legislative programme for the next session of
Parliament beginning in November, which will be the last full one before
the General Election, which must be held by April 1997.
About a dozen Bills were agreed in principle, several aiming to
increase freedom of choice in areas as diverse as education and health.
The surprise announcement was immediately seized on by Labour as an
admission that the current programme had ''run out of steam,'' but this
was rejected by a Government spokesman, who said the programme was
''full, purposeful and dynamic''.
In a break with tradition, Ministers are likely to publish drafts of
some of the Bills prior to the Queen's Speech at the opening of the next
session of Parliament, in which the new programme is usually announced.
Such an early settlement -- last year the programme was agreed only in
July -- aroused speculation at Westminster that the Prime Minister was
clearing the decks for an election in the spring of next year.
The more prosaic explanation appears to be that since the Budget has
been switched from March to November, the work of the parliamentary
draftsmen who draw up the new Bills has been complicated, with a period
when there is little for them to do and another when they have too much.
By agreeing its programme early, the Cabinet allows the draftsmen to
begin work on several Bills quickly, smoothing out their work pattern.
A Reserve Forces Bill dealing with changes to the Territorial Army and
other voluntary defence forces has been published already, but will not
be dealt with this session.
Publication will enable interested bodies to make comments and
suggestions that could be incorporated in a later draft.
Recent experience with English Criminal Justice Bills and another
dealing with the controversial Child Support Agency which have had to be
followed up by another Bill to correct errors in the first, has
convinced Ministers that Bills should have a longer period of scrutiny
before they go through Parliament.
They expect several of the measures to be electorally popular and are
anxious to give them the maximum of publicity. One Scottish Bill already
has been earmarked for session 1995-96.
Others will aim to reduce the red tape affecting business and industry
and make improvements to environmental protection.
Although not on the list approved yesterday, legislation creating new
penalties for noise pollution is also likely next year while another
Bill to deal with developments arising from the opening of the Channel
Tunnel will be required.
Mr Major also will probably carry out a last reshuffle of the Cabinet
and other ministerial ranks in the summer, selecting the team with which
he plans to fight the election.
His supporters hope that this might head off a leadership challenge to
him in the autumn, although one looks increasingly likely, especially if
the Conservatives still are languishing between 20 and 30 points behind
Labour in the opinion polls.
Deputy Labour leader John Prescott said:: ''The Prime Minister's
appeal for new ideas for Bills for the next session of Parliament is an
admission that the Government has run out of steam,'' he said.
''This is a Government without direction, without purpose and casting
around helplessly.
''The only good news to emerge from the Cabinet is that there will be
no Post Office privatisation in the next set of Bills.''

PLANS to build Scotland's first private prison on a site close to
Bishopbriggs will be scrapped as soon as Labour wins the next election,
the area's MP promised yesterday.
Mr Sam Galbraith had received confirmation in a parliamentary answer
from Scottish Office Minister, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, that the
site of the existing Glasgow Resettlement Centre at Bishopbriggs is
''one of a number of sites currently being considered . . .''
Lord James said in the answer that no final decisions had been taken.
However, The Herald understands that the other options, including
building within the perimeter of Shotts Prison or on an available
greenfield site, would prove more difficult.
The site next to the existing Low Moss Prison has become the front
runner. Mr Galbraith, MP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, said: ''I am
glad that at long last the Government has come out into the open about
this. My constituents are unhappy and I will be making strong
representations about this plan.

THE Government's controversial package of measures to change help for
the unemployed, especially through the introduction of a new jobseeker's
allowance, cleared the Commons last night.
The Jobseeker's Bill was given a third reading by 269 to 239, a
Government majority of 30, and now goes to the Lords.
Unemployment benefit and income support are replaced by the new
allowance. It cuts entitlement to non means-tested benefit from one year
to six months, reduces help for the jobless with mortgage repayments and
introduces measures to help people find work.
In the third reading debate, Employment Minister of State Ann
Widdecombe said the measure would provide for many winners.
However, to gasps from MPs, Tory ex-Minister Alan Howarth
(Stratford-on-Avon), a persistent critic of the measure, intervened to
demand sharply: ''Do you personally look forward to a world of benefit
cuts and boot camps?''
Miss Widdecombe replied that she had made no such proposals and she
looked forward to a world of focused, targeted benefits for those in
need.
The Bill was an ''entirely prudent, very just and actually very caring
measure'', she said.
Mr Keith Bradley, for Labour, said the measure's main purpose was to
cut social security spending and cut money to the unemployed.
''This Bill does not create a single job -- but inflicts further
hardship on those people without a job.''
He pledged his party would go on fighting the measure in Parliament.
Miss Liz Lynne, for the Liberal Democrats, said the Bill widened
inequality and would debar some people from getting benefits altogether.
''At worst, it could cause more homelessness, more poverty and more
despair.''
During the Bill's report stage earlier, Government plans for tougher
penalties against teenagers who refuse to co-operate with state-run
training schemes were backed by 268 votes to 230, a Government majority
of 38, despite Opposition protests.
Miss Widdecombe insisted the new system would be ''clear and fair''.
However, Ian McCartney, for Labour, claimed it was a ''vicious attack
on young people'', adding: ''It allows for the continuation of
exploitation of young people, does not protect minimum standards in
training and reduces choice for young people.''

LABOUR launched an attack on two fronts yesterday as the first firm
indication of private- sector interest in running rail services was
confirmed.
Party leader Tony Blair claimed the rail sell-off already had cost
more than #1000m, while Shadow Transport Minister Henry McLeish demanded
an end to the ''secrecy'' surrounding the names of the parties who have
expressed interest.
The Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (Opraf) confirmed that 37
companies -- including some from abroad -- had shown an interest in
running the first eight of the rail services offered to the private
sector. However, the franchise body refused to disclose the names of the
interested parties.
About half the companies have expressed interest in running all eight
lines. Managements of each of the eight rail services have submitted
their own bids. The franchises include operations run by ScotRail and
InterCity East Coast.
An Opraf spokesman could not confirm the interest in operations in
Scotland,
He would only say: ''A large number of the organisations have sought
to pre-qualify for all eight franchises. This effectively means that
there is likely to be significant interest in services operated by
ScotRail and InterCity East Coast.''
Mr Roger Salmon, Opraf director, said the response was ''excellent
news,'' which demonstrated the significant private sector interest in
passenger franchising.
Transport Secretary Dr Brian Mawhinney said the response was a ''vote
of confidence'' for rail privatisation, and added: ''I very much look
forward to passengers receiving better services when the first
privatised trains start running.''
However, Mr Blair launched Labour's anti-privatisation campaign by
dismissing the success claims, and stating that rail privatisation to
date had cost #1250m.
He said that, despite this, all that had so far passed into private
hands was a ballast quarry in Devon.
Mr Blair later clashed with the Prime Minister in the Commons over the
issue, with Mr Major branding Labour's calculations as ''fantasy
figures''.
Mr Major said he had seen Labour's news conference in the morning on
its rail privatisation report and dubbed it one of the ''shoddiest
pieces of work I have seen for some time''.
The Prime Minister insisted that the real cost would be a fraction of
the figure suggested by Labour ''and a very small price to pay for a
modern railway serving the nation in the way we wish to see it served''.
Meanwhile, Mr McLeish claimed the secrecy surrounding the identity of
bidders amounted to a ''cover-up'' of a further delay in the timetable
for privatisation.
He said: ''The franchise director used great fanfare to announce that
there had been 37 expressions of interest in the first eight rail
franchises advertised for sale.
''But the truth -- which he refused to reveal -- is that 16 of these
declarations come from either British Rail directly, or from British
Rail management.''
Mr McLeish questioned why Mr Salmon had refused to disclose the
identity of bidders, and added: ''He is a public servant and his duty
should be to protect and inform the public about just what is happening
to this great public industry.
''The truth is that the director is engaged in covering up the total
failure of the Tory privatisation. He has even delayed the privatisation
process further which is just another sign of how great the rail
privatisation shambles has become.''
Mr Salmon will now evaluate the expressions of interest before
inviting selected parties to tender. The first invitations are expected
to go out in early May, although invitations for the ScotRail and
InterCity East Coast will not be issued until late summer.
The successful bidders are expected to be announced by the end of the
year.
The Perth-based Stagecoach bus company is known to be one of several
concerns interested in all eight franchises, although it has gone on
record as saying its preference would be for the ScotRail and South-
West Trains operations.
Some bidders have already publicly declared their interest. Others
have remained anonymous.
The parties known to have bid for all eight franchises include London
&amp; Continental -- which includes Richard Branson's Virgin Group and
National Express, the West country-based Badgerline group (the UK's
second biggest private coach operator after Stagecoach), and French
water company Generale des Eaux.
The eight franchises on offer are ScotRail, InterCity East Coast,
Gatwick Express, Great Western, London Tilbury and Southend (LTS Rail),
Midland Main Line, Network SouthCentral, and South West Trains.

<HEADLINE>2200 jobs lost as dairy firm wields the axe</HEADLINE>

THE future of doorstep milk deliveries south of the Border was under
threat last night after a leading food and dairy company axed 2200 jobs,
amid fears of further cutbacks in the industry.
Hull-based Northern Foods blamed rising costs and falling home
deliveries for the huge job losses, which will hit workers in the North,
the Midlands and London.
Half the redundancies will affect the company's nine dairies, 500 jobs
will go from its bakery at Wembley, north London, and the rest will be
axed from Northern's meat business.
The job losses, on top of 1250 previously-announced redundancies, were
described as ''tragic'' by union leaders, who said workers now feared
further cuts.
In the Commons, Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave accused
Northern Foods of ''bad management'' and of ''bidding'' up the market by
offering farmers too much for their milk, which the company could not
then sell on to consumers at a reasonable profit.
Labour blamed last year's deregulation of the milk industry, which it
said had added 2p to a pint of milk delivered to the doorstep.
''The doorstep delivery is a public service of vital importance,
particularly to those who find it difficult to get to the shops,'' said
Labour's Treasury spokeswoman, Dawn Primarolo.''The daily pinta is
struggling to survive, and it looks as though the Tories want to finish
it off.''
Northern Foods, which employs nearly 30,000, said it was committed to
doorstep deliveries and maintained that none of its 2600 milk rounds
would be axed. The company suffered a 25% fall in pre-tax profits last
year.
The cost of a doorstep pint is now over a third more than a
supermarket pint in some areas. In the North of England, customers are
paying around 36p for a doorstep pint, and around 40p in London. By
contrast, supermarkets can offer a four-pint container for about 85p.
In recent years, the doorstep share of the milk market has fallen from
about 80% to below 45%. Firms fear it will fall to as low as 25% in the
next two years.
Replacing the Milk Marketing Board last year with the Milk Marque
increased the cost of milk by up to 10%.
Milk Marque chief executive Mr Andrew Dare and officials at the
Ministry of Agriculture said competition from supermarkets and not
deregulation of the industry was to blame for the job cuts.
Mr Chris Haskins, Northern Foods chairman, said it was a ''dreadful
day'' for the company. Around 1100 jobs will go over the next two years
from Northern Foods' nine dairies.
Rivals Unigate said in November that the arrival of Milk Marque had
increased its costs by #40m a year and would cut #10m off its 1994-95
profits.
The company warned there were likely to be job losses as a result.0

LIBERAL Democrat MP Charles Kennedy last night condemned the ''saga''
of the future of threatened sleeper services as ''a downright scandal''
-- saying that Transport Minister John Watts had disclosed that no
assessment has been made of the costs involved in any attempt to keep
them going.
Mr Kennedy had asked the Minister if estimates of the costs involved
in keeping the Fort William-London and Carlisle-London sleepers and the
Scotland to London motorail services in operation ''for the purpose of
an eight-week consultation period'' from May had been made.
He additionally asked whether any reckoning had been made of the
closure costs for the services, or if an estimate had been made of the
start-up costs associated with re-opening the services.
Mr Watts replied that the decision to withdraw the services from May
28 was ''a commercial decision by British Rail'' and added that the
''assets needed to run these services'' have been retained so they can
be restored should the franchising director decide to insist on their
inclusion in the Scotrail franchise. He admitted, however, that no
assessments or estimates had been made.
Mr Kennedy issued what he said was a full list of 21 rail services to
be axed this summer which he described as a ''Tory hit list of shame''
hitting right at the heart of the tourist industry. He said the services
to go were:
Sleepers: Fort William/Euston; Carlise/Euston; Glasgow/Edinburgh/
Plymouth.
Overnight seating: Aberdeen/Edinburgh/Euston; Glasgow/Euston.
Motorail: Aberdeen/Euston; Inverness/Euston; Fort William/Euston;
Edinburgh/Euston; Glasgow/Euston (night); Glasgow/Euston (day);
Carlisle/Euston (day); Edinburgh/Bristol.
Young Explorer locomotive hauled trains: Edinburgh/Inverness;
Inverness/Kyle of Lochalsh; Glasgow/Oban/Fort William.
Observation car: Inverness/Kyle of Lochalsh.
Restaurant car: Inverness/Kyle of Lochalsh.
Steamhauled: Fort William/ Mallaig.
Others: Wick/Georgemas branch shuttle; Inverness/Tain/Thurso fourth
daily service.

A SMALL luxury hotel yesterday sent out a glossy brochure to 32
million potential customers.
The Marcliffe at Pitfodels, on the outskirts of Aberdeen, has become
the first UK independent to use the full capabilities of the information
superhighway -- the Internet system.
''People looking at details about small luxury hotels, about salmon
fishing in Scotland, about golf, about the whisky trail, will all find
information about the Marcliffe through their computers,'' said owner
Stewart Spence.
''The 32 million Internet users now have access to a full brochure.
''The versatility is mind-blowing but the real nugget is that we can now
update our information at any time.''

THE locations of some speed cameras are decided for reasons of raising
revenue rather than reducing accidents, the Royal Automobile Association
claimed yesterday.
The RAC made the claim on the day it was announced motoring offences
recorded by the police in Scotland in 1993 had risen by 3% to 315,000.
Scottish Office figures show, for the first time, the number of
offenders dealt with by letter or fixed penalty outnumbered those taken
to court. The use of conditional offers of a fixed penalty instead of
prosecution rose by 136,800 in 1993, or 28%.
An RAC spokesperson said the use of speed cameras was to be encouraged
but added that it was felt some cameras were being sited on busy roads
to notch up convictions and so raise cash through fixed penalties.
She said: ''Cameras in some places are being used to make money,
whereas we want to see them sited at accident blackspots and dangerous
roads.''
A Strathclyde police spokesman said that was what happened anyway, and
insisted the force did not receive revenue from fines paid as a result
of motorists being caught by the network of cameras.
The RAC also expressed doubt about the growing trend of dealing with
motoring offences without involving the courts. The spokesperson said
that dealing with offences by post reduced the stigma for the motorist
and could impinge on efforts to persuade the public that breaking the
law when driving was totally unacceptable.
The Scottish Office statistics also reveal successive ''belt up''
campaigns have failed to get through to Scottish motorists.
A total of 23,800 seat-belt offences were recorded in Scotland in
1993, compared with 14,160 in the previous year, a 68% leap.

A LEADING Scottish hospital deals with children injured in window
falls at a rate of one every two months, a fatal accident inquiry heard
yesterday.
Reference was also made to the tragic plunge of rock guitarist Eric
Clapton's young son from a skyscraper window in New York.
Details were mentioned during day 10 of the inquiry at Haddington
Sheriff Court into the death of an East Lothian toddler.
Ewan Smith was 21 months old when he died in Edinburgh's Western
General Hospital on June 9 last year, two days after falling 30ft from
the second-storey bedroom window of a council flat in Moir Crescent,
Musselburgh.
Building scientist Mr Hunter Cairns, 56, told the inquiry he had
assessed a number of window restrictor devices. However, he was unaware
that Edinburgh's Royal Hospital for Sick Children dealt with children
injured in window falls at the rate of one every two months.
Mr Cairns, a senior lecturer at Heriot-Watt University, made a brief
reference to the death of the Clapton child while answering questions on
window hazard risks to children living in flats.
Earlier Mr Cairns told the inquiry that Ewan could not by himself have
opened the window he fell from. He alleged that the window safety
features had been over-ridden by someone else.
The inquiry heard how, in the event of fire, the restrictor catch
could be sprung at the touch of a finger.
The inquiry has already been told it was the second accident in a year
involving children plunging from emergency escape windows fitted to East
Lothian District Council houses.
A slug of metal, half the size of a finger-nail, may have led to
another toddler's fall from a bedroom window. A full-scale inquiry is
under way by East Lothian District Council to find out why the piece of
metal is missing from the catches in 2000 other homes.
The inquiry continues.

A CALL for a halt to all low-level flying by RAF and Nato air forces
over the UK until the Government can guarantee effective decontamination
of fast-jet crash sites was made last night by the Celtic League, an
independent military monitoring body.
The league, based in the Isle of Man, claims that up to a ton of
light-weight carbon fibre is used in the construction of most modern
fighters and bombers.
This fibre becomes a severe health hazard when it burns in the fierce
heat of an aviation fuel fire, giving off clouds of filaments, which can
cause an asbestosis-type effect if inhaled or severe skin irritation if
it lands on unprotected skin.
A spokesman for the league said: ''The RAF only became aware of the
extent of the problem after the crash of a Harrier jump-jet in Denmark
in 1990.
''We contend that there is a need to discontinue low flying until
guarantees can be given on public safety, and that all crash sites over
the last five to 10 years should be examined for contamination.''
A spokesman for the Air Secretariat of the Defence Ministry said: ''It
is our policy to ensure that the site of any aircraft accident is, as
near as is practicable, restored to its former condition.
''As part of this policy, an aircraft recovery officer is always
appointed with the responsibility for sweeping the crash scene for
wreckage or any form of contaminant.''

THE fishing boat used by looters of the SS Politician in the film
Whisky Galore is set to be relaunched -- after falling into disrepair
and ending up in a back garden in Fife.
After her brief moment of fame in the comedy film based on Sir Compton
Mackenzie's novel, the 38ft Usan, built at Cockenzie in 1937, was left
high and dry. Now her saviour, Mr Alex Hendry, is looking for an
enterprising enthusiast to finish restoring her to her former glory.
Mr Hendry, who has put the Usan up for sale for #15,000, stumbled upon
the old wooden vessel by chance and was amazed to find all the original
brass fittings and doors in surprisingly good condition.
''A body like the National Trust should be doing something to preserve
this very special boat,'' he said. ''I am sure, if she was renovated
back to her original state, there would be a huge demand from tourists
wanting to cruise on, say, Loch Ness. Most of the work has been done by
us, so it would not take much effort to get her back out on the water
again.''
Since being moved to Inverkeithing, on the shores of the Forth, the
boat has been redecked, ribs have been replaced and the engine has been
overhauled.
Whisky Galore was based on the true story of the Politician, which
sank in a gale after hitting a reef in the Sound of Eriskay, off South
Uist, in 1941.
Incredulous islanders discovered that the ship was loaded with 264,750
bottles of whisky. Once their initial disbelief had turned to joy, they
''rescued'' much of the cargo, using a ketch.
The looted bottles were hidden from the authorities under croft house
floorboards, in barns and in peat stacks. A few bottles have been found
in the wreck since. In 1987, eight salvaged bottles raised more than
#4000 at auction.
While Whisky Galore was a comedy, few cinema-goers realised that 40
islanders were arrested and 15 received prison sentences for their part
in the escapade.

MANCHESTER United footballer Eric Cantona was last night being
comforted by his family and was said to be in a state of shock over a
two-week prison sentence imposed for his infamous kung-fu attack on a
football supporter.
It was an assault that has been shown on television throughout the
world and has disgraced the game in England.
Cantona was held in custody yesterday as lawyers travelled between
courts in Croydon, South London, to obtain his release on #500 bail
after he had pled guilty to common assault.
Last night, the player was said to be devastated by the magistrates'
decision that he should go to prison. Club mate Paul Ince had appeared
at the same Croydon magistrates court and denied a similar charge
arising out of the same incident.
Most people had anticipated a hefty fine on the 28-year-old volatile
French soccer player. His counsel had insisted that the only fair
sentence was a conditional discharge.
The magistrates did not agree. After a retiral of 50 minutes, they
returned and announced the prison sentence.
Mrs Jean Pearch, a music teacher and chairman of magistrates at
Croydon, declared: ''You are a high profile public figure with undoubted
gifts and as such you are looked up to by many young people. For this
reason, the only sentence that is appropriate for this offence is two
weeks' imprisonment forthwith.''
Before passing sentence, the chairman of magistrates had asked that an
interpreter, who had sat beside the football player throughout the
hearing, be sworn in so that everything that was said thereafter would
be totally understood and that every word she said should be translated.
After the player had been released on bail pending an appeal against
sentence, Manchester United lawyer, Mr Maurice Watkins, said Cantona was
looking forward to relaxing between now and the appeal after a
''harrowing'' day.
He said the player had conducted himself with calmness and dignity
throughout the day but was clearly upset.
Having jailed the player, the magistrates later decided it was not
appropriate for them to release him on bail pending an appeal --
immediately announced by his counsel.
However, at the nearby Crown Court, Judge Mr Ian Davies did allow bail
pending an appeal against sentence. The appeal will be heard next
Friday.
Outside the courts there were those who cried over the sentence. There
were others happy to shout abuse at Cantona, similar to the kind that is
alleged to have led to the assault.
Cantona's counsel had told the magistrates that no matter the
provocation in future he would not react.

ANOTHER Henry Moore statue on the estate where the famous King and
Queen was beheaded by vandals has been removed to a place of safety.
It is the 7ft 3in tall Standing Figure which was sculpted in the 1950s
and was the first sculpture to be erected on Glenkiln estate, near
Dumfries, by the late Sir William Keswick.
It has been moved on the instructions of his son Henry, the present
owner, a director of Jardine Matheson Company. The King and Queen is
being taken to Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, for repair by experts.
But there are no plans at present to move the other open-air
sculptures, Glenkiln Cross and Two-Piece Reclining Figure No 1, both by
Moore; Visitation by Jacob Epstein and John the Baptist by Auguste
Rodin.
Mr Tom Florey, of Smith Gore, factors for the estate, said: ''Standing
Figure has been moved on the instructions of Mr Keswick. He felt it was
prudent to move it because it is near a road and is a bronze like King
and Queen.''
He said the factors had phoned Mr Keswick in Hong Kong about the
vandalism.
''It was the first news he received when he stepped off a plane,''
said Mr Florey. ''He was greatly saddened by what has happened.''
Police are still investigating the vandalism which is believed to have
happened at the end of last week. The heads of the two figures were sawn
off.
They had still not been recovered yesterday. Members of a sub-aqua
club will search for them tomorrow in Glenkiln Reservoir near where the
priceless sculpture had stood unharmed for 40 years.

A MAN who murdered his former boss, Dundee publican Danny Hallett, by
shooting him was jailed for life at the High Court in Edinburgh
yesterday.
As the verdict was announced that George Tolmie was guilty of murder,
a woman screamed from the public benches: ''He did not do it'' and broke
down.
Tolmie, 39, of Clepington Road, Dundee, had claimed Mr Hallett, 46,
was a victim of drugs barons because he owed them #10,000 and was
executed by a gunman who disappeared into the night.
Tolmie claimed he had pleaded with the gunman to spare his own life
and that the gunman left Tolmie with the dead body saying: ''He's your
problem now.''
The jury yesterday found Tolmie, formerly Hallett's commercial
manager, guilty of murder by majority verdict following a 10-day trial.
He was convicted of assaulting Mr Hallett, of Findhorn Street, Dundee,
firing a loaded shotgun at him and murdering him on ground known as
Scramble Hill, Pathcondie Farm, Letham, Fife, on November 3 last year.
He was also convicted of having a shotgun at the farm without holding
a shotgun certificate and burying body using a mechanical digger to dig
the grave at Scramble Hill on November 4 last year.
Tolmie had not given evidence at the trial, but the court heard how he
went to police told them that he had watched Mr Hallett being gunned
down by an unknown gunman.
He told them that he had covered the body with planks and stones the
night Mr Hallett was killed and then returned to Dundee to host a
karaoke night.
The next day he borrowed a mechanical digger returned to Scramble
Hill, which is used as a range by his shooting club, Tayforth Gun Club,
and buried Mr Hallett's body.
Tolmie claimed Mr Hallett had asked him to come with him to meet the
men to whom he owed #10,000 and stand as guarantor. Tolmie said at the
time he was remortgaging his house and agreed to lend Mr Hallett the
#10,000.
The court heard from Mr Hallett's estranged wife Dail Hallett, 40,
that she was not on speaking terms with him because she had left him for
one his barmen.
Mrs Hallett said that she did not believe her husband was involved in
drugs in any way. She told the court: ''He hated taking even
Paracetamol.''
She said that Tolmie had inquired about an insurance policy which he
thought Mr Hallett had held, but Mrs Hallett said there was no current
policy.
The court also heard that, at the time of his death, Mr Hallett's
Dundee pub business, Constable's Bar, Dundee, had failed and was in
receivership. He had debts totalling more than #100,000.
It was a row about the sale of a #2500 karaoke machine that led Tolmie
to act out his fantasy of committing the ''perfect' murder.
However, only days after killing and burying Mr Hallett, a former
boxer who weighed 20 stones, nerves got the better of the him and Tolmie
led police to the grave.
A gun fanatic, Tolmie shot at Bisley and when police went to his house
they discovered an arsenal of two rifles, three automatic pistols, and a
shotgun.
Tolmie made a living from running karaoke nights with a machine, which
he claimed to have bought from the receivers. But last year Hallett, of
Findhorn Street, Dundee, sold it for #2500 to another publican.
Furious at having been cheated, Tolmie put his plan for the
''perfect'' murder into operation.

FIREFIGHTERS last night successfully prevented major damage to
historical artefacts when they put out a blaze in a Hamilton rubbish
transfer site.
The items, which came from Hamilton Palace when it was demolished in
1928, were stored under the brick-built building on the Hillhouse
Industrial Estate.
A district council spokesman said the fire brigade had stopped the
fire reaching the storeroom, which held a marble staircase and an ornate
mirror and some other items.
The district council rubbish store was due to be replaced this year by
a new facility on the Lanarkshire town's outskirts.

LOCKED in a cell for three hours yesterday, Eric Cantona was then
escorted to freedom by a posse of police officers in scenes reminiscent
of the protection afforded to superstar soccer heroes after glorious
results on the field.
On this occasion, Cantona's flying kung-fu attack on an alleged soccer
fan, which has disgraced English football, had resulted in a two-week
jail sentence. The police protection was to get him through hordes of
photographers who wanted to snap him in his shame.
Cantona's release from the cells was only until a rematch can be held
next Friday. This will be for an appeal against the magistrates'
decision. By opting to challenge their ruling, he runs the risk that an
appeal court could increase the sentence.
Throughout the hearing at Croydon magistrates court Cantona looked
composed. At one stage he folded his hands across his chest. On another
he drummed his fingers on the desk in front of him.
Nevertheless, a cell had been prepared for him at nearby High Down
prison -- a modern establishment that caters for category ''C'' inmates.
During his short incarceration Cantona maintained his composure, but was
worried about how it would be affecting his family.
His Manchester United team mate Paul Ince, who has pled not guilty to
a similar charge of common assault, had stayed in court after his trial
date had been set to hear his colleague's case.
Mr Ince left court rather shocked at the outcome declaring, through
his solicitor, that his feelings were with Mr Cantona and his family.
Cantona's wife Isabelle is expecting a second child in June and they
have a six-year-old son, Raphael.
There was a short burst of applause from a small section of the public
gallery as the magistrates announced that a term of imprisonment was the
only appropriate sentence for a man who is still earning #5400 a week --
even though he is banned from playing football at any level until the
beginning of October. But there were also Manchester United supporters
in tears.
At the outset of yesterday's hearing, counsel for the unpredictable
soccer player apologised to everyone connected with the kung-fu attack
on the Crystal Palace fan, shown on television screens throughout the
world, following Cantona's sending off at a league match in January.
Mr David Poole, QC, could not deny that on the football field his
client had a volatile record. But he emphasised that off it he was a man
of unblemished character who had come from a poor family and had left
school at 15 to become a professional football player. He also went out
of his way to assist charities.
On the occasion of his sending off at Crystal Palace, he did not
dispute the referee's decison. If there was anger it was directed at
himself.
However, the QC then attempted to excuse Cantona's 10 seconds of
retaliation against a football fan who had allegedly left his seat 11
rows back to hurl abuse at the player as he left the field.
''These were words designed to goad and provoke and they were words
designed to hurt and insult Eric Cantona on three counts. Firstly on his
race and nationality, secondly on his sexual integrity, and thirdly on
the sexual integrity of his closest and dearest relative . . . his
mother.''
The court had been provided with statements from independent witnesses
backing up Mr Cantona's account of the abuse being directed at him, and
indeed his mother.
A fan will appear in the same magistrates court today where he is
expected to face charges arising out of the incident.
As the allegations of the racist and insulting words were read out to
the court, the clerk asked if Mr Cantona understood what was being said.
Mr Cantona said to his translator: ''It is the only English that I do
understand.'' His words did not carry to the magistrates.
Mr Jeffrey McCann, prosecuting, read out a statement from the player
presented to police after his arrest. In it Cantona declared that he
became aware of the man shouting and gesticulating at him. ''His face
was contorted with rage. He was shouting in abusive, racist and
nationalistic terms.
''I was obviously hurt and insulted and I reacted in a way I deeply
regret by jumping up and kicking out towards him.'' The player's
statement continued: ''I am very aware I should not have done it. I wish
to appologise. I am deeply upset and anxious about it.''
Mr McCann described how the football player had to launch himself over
hoardings, about 4ft high, to attack the supporter. He said: ''The
incident could have escalated into major public disorder, but due to
good policing and stewardship it was nipped in the bud very quickly.''
Earlier, Ince, 27, pled not guilty to assaulting Dennis Warren in the
same incident. His trial has been set for May 23.

<HEADLINE>Graham family of Glenrothes finally evicted</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979239213</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Graham family of Glenrothes were evicted from their home
yesterday, six days earlier than expected.
Mr Gordon Graham, 39, and his wife, Anne, 35, had frustrated a
previous attempt to evict them for alleged rent arrears by barricading
the house. But they were not at home this time when sheriff officers and
police arrived.
Since a chip pan fire on February 21 and subsequent water damage plus
extensive vandalism made the house unsafe to live in, they and four of
their children -- the fifth, 16-year-old James is serving a five-year
jail sentence -- have been staying with relatives.
Delighted neighbours said a squad of sheriff officers, accompanied by
police, arrived with a large hired van at about 2pm.
They said that at least four sheriff officers carried the remainder of
the family's belongings, including a carpet and three-piece suite, from
the house, which had been boarded up by the Glenrothes Development
Corporation.
According to neighbours up to six police stood by to prevent trouble
but there was no sign of the Grahams until after the sheriff officers
left.
Later, some members of the family toured the area in a car sounding
the horn and were gesticulated at by some neighbours.
Last night an uneasy calm descended on the area, nicknamed ''Little
Bosnia'' because of persistent anti-social behaviour by some of the
Graham family, and neighbours feared there may be repercussions.
Two hours after the eviction, three police officers were still on
patrol in the area and it is understood extra police will be on
surveillance duty over the next few days.
Told of the eviction, Central Fife Labour MP Mr Henry McLeish, who
gave evidence against the family at a 17-day eviction hearing last year
and whose near-by home has been under police guard since Gordon Graham
threatened on TV to park a caravan outside it, said: ''I sincerely hope
today's developments will end the nightmare that has been experienced by
residents in this area.
''The family have no-one to blame but themselves. Over the past few
years the life of a community has been turned upside down and this sad
state of affairs could not continue.
''I hope there will be no further trouble and that my local
constituents can get back to a normal life.''
A spokesman for Glenrothes Development Corporation said: ''When we
were granted an eviction decree at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court on March 1 it
was anticipated that the eviction could not take place before 12 noon on
March 29.
''However, when the extract decree was received by the corporation
from the sheriff clerk it was noted that it stated the eviction could
take place after 12 noon on March 23.''
Some neighbours were still too afraid of ''hassle'' from the Grahams
to speak of their delight at the eviction. Others refused to give their
names.
But Mr Ron Braid, 63, of Lundin Place said: ''We are all highly
delighted. We have had long enough of them . . . 10 years.
''I feel sorry for whoever gets saddled with them next unless they go
to Gruinard or some anthrax island. I don't care where they are as long
as they are well away from here.''
Another neighbour, Mr John Syme, 77, said: ''I am glad to see them
away. We will get peace and quiet now.''
The eviction followed the rejection earlier this month of the Grahams'
last legal bid to avoid eviction.
Sheriff Principal of Tayside, Central and Fife John Maguire, who had
previously rejected their appeal against Kirkcaldy Sheriff Gail
Patrick's original order when they failed to make any submissions to
him, refused to give them permission to take their case to the Court of
Session, stating no point of principle was involved in the case.
The Grahams had expenses of almost #1800 awarded against them.
Mr Graham also owes #29,000 to the corporation for the costs of the
original hearing, but in this case no costs were awarded against his
wife as at that time she was covered by legal aid.
During last year's eviction action, raised by GDC on the grounds that
the Grahams had breached their tenancy agreement and were involved in
persistent anti-social behaviour, it was claimed residents of Alexander
Road had suffered years of misery at the hands of some of the family.
The hearing heard sheriff officers who attempted to carry out a
previous eviction for rent arrears had been pelted by metal objects and
excrement and the door handle of the barricaded house had been
electrified.

AGRICULTURE Minister Angela Browning agreed yesterday to look into
allegations that live veal calves are being transported to the Continent
via back-door exports through the Scottish port of Cairnryan.
The issue was raised during agriculture questions in the Commons by
Labour MP Dennis Canavan (Falkirk West) who said there were reports that
Cairnryan was being used by English farmers, keen to escape the
demonstrations at south of England ports.
Mr Canavan said the animals were being shipped to Larne in County
Antrim, then smuggled across the Ulster border before being shipped to
the Continent via ports in the Irish Republic.
He told the Commons: ''By the time they have reached their intended
destination they have, in some cases, travelled over 2500 miles.''
Mrs Browning said she ''certainly'' would look into the situation, and
urged Mr Canavan to provide her with evidence to back up his
allegations.
Mr Canavan later told The Herald that he had already sent evidence to
the Ministry of Agriculture.
However, the Labour MP met opposition from Mr Roy Beggs, Ulster
Unionist MP for Antrim East, who accused him of spreading a
''falsehood'' and said that there was no evidence to support the
allegations he was making.
He said the Scottish Office had sent him records of all transfers of
live cattle being shipped from Scotland to Larne and he had found no
evidence to support Mr Canavan's claims.
