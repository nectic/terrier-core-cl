BRIAN Lara is set to make his return to cricket tomorrow for Trinidad and
Tobago in a Red Stripe Cup trial match.
Theo Cuffy, the Trinidad and Tobago manager, said that Lara, who withdrew from
the West Indies party for the current tour of Australia, has accepted the
captaincy of the team for the Cup competition starting next month.
``Brian is set to play on Friday and we are all looking forward to seeing him
back making runs. It will be great to see him out there,'' said Cuffy.
``He has had his rest and he wants to get back to playing cricket. He is
looking relaxed and at ease. This holiday has done him a world of good.''
He also hinted that the record-breaking batsman would play for the West Indies
in the forthcoming World Cup.
``I am sure he would like to captain Trinidad and Tobago to a Red Stripe
victory, but he will most likely be available for only the first two games, as
the West Indies are due to travel to India for the World Cup.''
The holder of world record scores for Test (375) and first-class cricket (501
not out), withdrew from the West Indies squad for Australia after being fined
10% of his fee for breaches of contract during the tour to England this summer.
It was reported that he was in conflict with other members of the party,
including skipper Richie Richardson, and threatened to quit the tour and even
retire from cricket.

IN TRUTH, as we hurtle towards the new twelve-month, there are only two
political questions worth the asking. Will Mr John Major avoid being booted out
in 1996? Will Mr Tony Blair avoid being found out?
I have long held to the view, as Ms Ruth Wishart of these pages but not of my
party will give witness M'Lud, that Mr Major will lead the Tories into the next
election. Indeed I offered, on air, to wager with the good lady that this would
be the ultimate turn of events, a bet she, probably wisely, turned down. But
that does not completely answer the first question.
The Grim Reaper might intervene, invite a few Conservative servants to join him
on the first tee of the Heavenly golf course, like tomorrow. Mr Major's
anorexic Commons majority could wither on the vine, an election be forced, a
furniture van called. Yet I still do not think it will end that way.
Those men of natural suspicion, and maybe they have much to be suspicious
about, the Ulster Unionists, are in no great hurry to install the socialists,
or what passes for them nowadays, to rule over our land. Mr Blair's charm is
not sufficient for them - it will never be enough to becalm the great wind of
Paisley.
So the Unionists will threaten, cajole, procrastinate but not, I guess, pull
the plug.
The PM, however, faces the enemy within, and the foe faces several ways at
once. On Europe he is at risk from both the sceptics and the phobes but most of
all from the 50 or so of his MPs who are opting for early retirement. ``You can
take your Whip and stick it where . . .''
Come May, say, and the party is still looking like being relegated from the
Premier League opinion polls, what then? Will the pin-striped suited ones -
they were never grey - come a-calling? It could happen, though it is not my
belief that it will.
Whatever might be said of John Major he can hardly be called a quitter.
Coruscated by critics from right and left, lampooned on television, snobbily
sneered at by magazines who should know better, the PM contrives to survive and
to maintain his good humour. I think he will be on the starting line; but you
can still have the bet, Ruth.
No-one doubts, unless he flings himself under that murderous old bus, that Mr
Blair will lead Labour. The question is - to where? To Government, you foolish
boy. Yes, I know that is the plan, and one would have to say it appears to be
proceeding smoothly, but I sense the big examinations are just around the
corner.
Can we ask about Peter Mandelson, Tony? This good pal of yours, we learn -
lovely to have Labour leak for a change - wrote a 22-page outline for a book
which suggested he believed, post-devolution, that we should shed 15 of our
Scottish MPs at Westminster.
I think he is absolutely right, myself, and so do the Liberal Democrats, but
that is hardly the point. It's not what we are being told by you, is it? It's
not party policy.
Will Peter have to be publicly humiliated, like Clare Short when she said we
might examine whether certain drugs could be de-criminalised? Or is he echoing
his master's voice? What about his notion of abolishing local education
authorities - that will go down a treat with the Labour councillors - or
forming coalitions with the Lib-Dems? This is not some doe-eyed kid from the
back benches, this is your doctor of spin, your guru.
Now we will be told that this was only a rough draft of what Peter intended to
write, that the published book will be different - I'm certain it will - and
that the Tories are troublemaking again. Stand by for a lot more of that. And
maybe even from your own side.
Like Mr John McWilliam, MP for Blaydon. I know him - he used to be the City
Treasurer in Edinburgh - and he is a perfectly moderate bloke. Yet John is
worried, as are a lot of northern English MPs, that their regions might be
disadvantaged if a Scottish Parliament is set up.
He is threatening to table amendments to any devolution Bill if assurances are
not received. Shades of a certain Mr Cunningham (Lab) in days gone by.
You see, Tony, there are still a lot of Scots, and not just Nats, who wonder
about your commitment to the Parliament. They see how you have wriggled on
English regional assemblies, have agreed to make the Welsh Parliament little
more than a hot-air stall, and have run away from the implications of a Tartan
Tax. ``We won't necessarily raise the tax.'' And the band played.
You cannot blame them for wondering what else is being hidden. You will not
stop them asking such questions in the next year.
Paul Johnson is another pal of yours, or so he claims. You know the chap - was
once a red-hot socialist, then worshipped Mrs Thatcher, is now a declared
supporter of you. He says he hopes and believes that you will be our first
Catholic Prime Minister.
That would make not one whit of difference to the manner in which I would judge
Mr Blair. Indeed, if the Prince of Wales wanted to marry someone of the
Catholic faith after his divorce, I should fight for his right to do so.
But I can just hear the spin doctors going into over-rev. ``You can't do it,
Tony, even if you wanted to, it would offend too many voters.'' I do not think
we will hear confirmation of any change of church from Mr Blair.
Which, if that is what he would like to do, is rather sad.
We are in for a hot political year, mes amis; you will understand if I take a
little break in King Carlos's land before we gear up for it together.

A CLYDE town has stepped into the row over dangers posed by munitions dumped in
a trench off the south-west coast.
Dumbarton is to protest to the European Commissioner for the Environment about
the Beaufort's Dyke disposal site in the North Channel.
The council is to demand the introduction of more comprehensive monitoring
programmes in the area by the Ministry of Defence.
Dumbarton district's planning convener, Mr Jack Duffy, said the council wished
to establish the dump's impact on the environment.
``It is of the utmost importance to determine the extent and nature of the
environmental problems and also of the threat posed to the fishing and tourism
industries by such disposal sites,'' Mr Duffy said.
``In the light of the full facts, we must consider any appropriate action.''
The council's action follows a protest by Lancashire County Council about
dangerous phosphorous bombs being washed up on beaches along the coast there.
Mr Gordon Johnson, Lancashire's chief executive, said: ``Of particular concern
to Lancashire County Council is the dumping site of Beaufort's Dyke in the
North Channel and the surrounding area, and exercises such as Operation
Sandcastle, whereby chemical weapons were shipped from locations on the
north-west coast for disposal in deep Atlantic waters.
``The council is also concerned about numerous accounts which cast doubt on
whether some of these operations were carried out in the correct manner, and
whether materials were actually disposed of in the authorised sites.''
Some observers believe the situation only came to light because British Gas
disturbed the munitions while laying a pipeline from Scotland to Ireland.

SQUASH
SCOTTISH junior champion Lisa McKenna, last year's beaten finalist, is the only
home top seed in the Bank of Scotland Scottish Junior Open championships which
start today in Edinburgh.
With a record entry of almost 200, including players from every continent, the
championships have been split into two venues this year - Heriot-Watt
University and Colinton Castle - and, after a season troubled by injury McKenna
will have to recapture her best form to justify her favourite's billing.
Belgium's Kim Hanns is the No.2 seed. She lost to McKenna in last year's
semi-finals but is currently the top-ranked junior on the European circuit.
``It's been a very frustrating time for me over the last few months,'' said
McKenna, a full-timer who will be 18 on New Year's Day. ``But, hopefully, my
feet, thumb, and finger problems are behind me and this championship will mark
the start of the comeback.''
Sweden's No.1, Johan Jungling, is top seed in the boys' under-19 championship,
with Grant Finlay, the leading South African junior, at No.2.
Scottish junior champion Colin Hamilton cannot get higher than the 5/8 list of
seeds, while Neil Dickson is in the 9/16 group.
In the younger sections, Elgin's Simon Hall and Steven Halliday, from Eyemouth,
are both seeded 5/8 in the under-16 championships, while Bridge of Allan's
Peter Campbell, a shock finalist in this season's British event, and Waverley's
Lizzie Leitch should figure in the later stages of the under-14 age group.

Butterfly McQueen, actress, born January 8, 1911, Tampa, Florida, died December
22, 1995, Augusta, Georgia
THE black Hollywood actress Butterfly McQueen, who has died at the age of 84,
is essentially remembered for just one film performance, her first. She made
her screen debut as Prissy, the stereo-typical Southern slave servant who
tended to Olivia de Havilland in David O Selznick's 1939 epic, Gone With The
Wind.
It was, for its day, a controversial role and one which, in today's politically
correct times, would never be permitted. In racial terms, Prissy was a
caricature - and a comic one at that. Nevertheless, the exquisitely-named
Butterfly played the part with memorable aplomb and absurdity.
Ms McQueen, the last living connection with the multi-Oscar winning Civil War
soap opera, was born in Tampa, Florida, the daughter of a dock worker father
and domestic servant mother. Before becoming an actress, she worked in a
variety of jobs including factory work and a children's nurse.
In the mid-30s she travelled to New York to join Vanezuela Jones's Negro Youth
Project in Harlem where she trained as a dancer. After changing her Christian
name from Thelma to Butterfly, she sought work on stage and screen.
After her success in Gone With The Wind, she had a minor role in George Cukor's
comedy, The Women, the same year and later in Michael Curtiz's 1945 film noir,
Mildred Pierce.
By the late forties, however, she was becoming uncomfortable with playing the
role of black ``handkerchief head'' all the time and, after appearing as
Lillian Gish's servant in Selznick's 1946 Western, Duel in the Sun, she
deserted Hollywood - and the acting profession.
She took many jobs over the years including a sales assistant in the toy
department at Macy's in New York, a taxi-cab dispatcher in the Bronx, and
(ironically) the maid to a white couple in Atlanta. In the 1970s, as the civil
rights movement gained momentum, Ms McQueen concentrated on helping with social
work projects in Harlem and, at the age of 64, she gained a degree from the
City College in New York.
Occasionally, she would return to acting. She received an Emmy Award in 1965
for a role in the television film, The Seven Wishes Of A Rich Kid, and in 1986
she had a small role in the Australian director Peter Weir's film, The Mosquito
Coast.
In 1989, as the movie industry marked the 50th anniversary of Gone With The
Wind, the elderly actress was in tremendous demand worldwide. She made a
memorable appearance during the Edinburgh Film Festival that year and endeared
herself to millions with several appearances on television chat shows.

ENGLAND denied teenager Paul Adams instant success at St George's Park, but
face an uphill battle after losing a lot of ground on day two of the fourth
Test in Port Elizabeth.
First they allowed South Africa to total 428 all out, spilling six catches
along the way. Then opener Alec Stewart fell for only four during the second
over after edging an ambitious back-foot forcing shot against fast bowler Shaun
Pollock.
Stewart has now gone 16 Test innings since his last half-century as an opener
and yesterday's dismissal put new recruit Jason Gallian under real pressure,
which increased once Adams was introduced after only half-an-hour.
The debut-making, 18-year-old wrist spinner had a raucous lbw appeal against
Gallian turned down when his third delivery turned past a forward defensive
stroke.
But England's new No.3 and Lancashire team-mate Mike Atherton kept Adams at
bay, taking 16 runs off his seven overs as the tourists reached 40 for one by
close.
Atherton's team denied Daryll Cullinan (91) and Dave Richardson (84) centuries
yesterday, but, apart from that, there was little cause for satisfaction, with
Mark Ilott's thigh strain, which forced the Essex paceman off the field in
mid-afternoon, adding to a worrying picture.
South Africa's innings finally came to a close 50 minutes into the evening
session, when last-man Adams was run out by Gallian's throw from the deep. The
teenager failed to get off the mark after facing only two deliveries, but,
thanks to his team-mates, the left-armer has plenty of runs to bowl at today.
England did their prospects no good at all by failing to take most of the
chances that came their way.
Dominic Cork prompted thoughts of a successful day for the tourists when he
dismissed former Derbyshire team-mate Cullinan after South Africa had added
only 21 runs to their overnight total of 230 for four.
Called up for the seventh over of the morning, Cork's first ball was short and
wide outside off stump, but Cullinan's attempted cut gave Jack Russell a low
catch in front of first slip.
England's attack showed an alarming lack of accuracy, which allowed Brian
McMillan and Richardson to add 75 runs for the sixth wicket.
All five bowlers - Peter Martin, Ilott, Cork, Richard Illingworth, and Gallian
- tried by Atherton during the morning session failed to apply the basic
principles of line and length. Twenty-seven overs before lunch yielded eleven
4s, as well as the 6 McMillan pulled off an Illingworth full toss.
All-rounder McMillan reached 49 only to miss out on a mini-milestone by
under-edging a cut against spinner Illingworth during the fifth over after
lunch.
At 326 for six, England could still have kept the home total to reasonable
proportions, but then came Richardson's stand of 53 with Shaun Pollock, who
survived difficult chances to Atherton at short mid-wicket and Illingworth off
the left-armer's own bowling, and then was given the benefit of the doubt
following a run-out appeal.
Cork ended Pollock's contribution at 23 by winning an lbw verdict and, after
tea, Richardson's near four-hour innings - containing 11 boundaries - was
brought to a close by Illingworth. A ball pitching outside leg stump turned
quite sharply, brushed bat, glove, and pad, and finally ended in Russell's
gloves as the keeper scampered from behind the stumps.
By then, South Africa were past 400 but more catches were about to go down,
even if they cost very little. Three chances in four balls were dropped, with
Craig Matthews being reprieved by Graham Thorpe at extra cover, before Gallian
and Illingworth let Allan Donald escape - all during an over from Illingworth.
q.DOMINIC Cork has been warned to keep his celebrations on ``an even keel'' by
match referee Clive Lloyd.
The England all-rounder appeared to shout something after dismissing South
African batsman Jonty Rhodes on the opening day and former West Indies captain
Lloyd asked to look at a recording of the incident and decided no official
action was necessary.
``The umpires had no complaint and I'm satisfied nothing was said to the
batsman,'' commented the referee. ``But I've had a friendly word with Cork and
told him of the need to keep his celebrations on an even keel in case something
is misconstrued.''

Oil fouls swans
A COOKING oil spill is thought to have injured 37 swans at the mouth of the
Tweed at Berwick earlier this month. The National Rivers Authority is
investigating, while the swans are being treated at a special centre on the
town's quay.

A COUNTRY vicar has modelled a series of nude sculptures of the disciples. The
Rev Toddy Hoare, 47, worked on the panels during a three months sabbatical at
his vicarage. ``Parishioners are beginning to spark a bit now they've seen
them,'' said Mr Hoare, who runs eight hillside parishes in Herriot country near
Thirsk, North Yorkshire.

LIBERAL Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown predicted yesterday that the Prime
Minister would be forced to go to the polls next year because his beleaguered
Government could not last another 12 months.
``In my bones, I do not think the Government is going to get through the next
year,'' Mr Ashdown said.
Mr Major faces the prospect of a Commons majority of three in the new year
following the death of the South-east Staffordshire MP, Sir David Lightbown,
and potentially disastrous local government elections in May.
He must call a General Election by May 1997, but his overall majority could be
demolished by two further by-election losses, prompting speculation that
Ministers are planning an early election to avoid running the risks of
staggering into the final year as some sort of lame-duck government.
In what may be seen as a high-risk strategy, Mr Ashdown said the Liberal
Democrats would contest the election on a platform which included a clear
commitment to European integration and a single currency.
``I want people out there to know that on this issue the Liberal Democrats can
be relied upon to be a rock in favour of the process of European integration,''
he told ITN.
He said: ``If the Prime Minister leads a divided party, with lack of leadership
and without a capacity to stake out a clear position, I am afraid to say that
the same precisely applies to the Labour Party.''

EXCLUSIVE
THE bank account of the troubled Burns International Festival company has been
arrested as part of a continuing legal battle with a firm which carried out
work for next year's festival.
Sheriff officers yesterday served an order on the Bank of Scotland in High
Street, Ayr, which effectively freezes #20,000 in the account until a wrangle
over outstanding professional fees is resolved.
A writ for non-payment of professional fees is also being served on the
festival company.
The Greenock-based Affinity Partnership was engaged almost a year ago to seek
sponsorship for the 1996 festival, which is being staged to commemorate the
bicentenary of the death of Robert Burns.
After many months of disagreement between the festival and Affinity over the
work which was being carried out, there was a parting of the ways in August.
Mr George Mills of the Affinity Partnership said: ``We regret that things have
come to this but we have contracts which state that we are due certain
professional fees. Quite frankly we are fed up waiting for the festival, which
seems to be stumbling from crisis to crisis, to pay up.
``We hope that the action we are taking will be brought to a speedy and
satisfactory conclusion by our legal advisers.''
By coincidence the fees which are in dispute relate to early work carried out
on the possibility of a tie-up between the festival and the Bank of Scotland on
a Burns bicentenary Visa card.
A bank spokeswoman said: ``An announcement on the card is likely to be made in
the middle of January. I would stress that negotiations relating to the card
took place between the festival and a company acting on our behalf in Reading.
``At no time were we involved in negotiations with the Affinity Partnership
over the credit card plan.''
Mr Mills claims that some sponsorship had been secured before their contract
was abruptly ended and that further fees could be sought from the festival
company in the coming weeks. It is understood that festival director, Mr John
Struthers, disputes the level of assistance given by Affinity

and was dissatisfied with their work.
He was unavailable for comment yesterday but a spokesman for the festival
company said: ``We are somewhat surprised to hear this news as we have been in
discussion with our legal advisers with a view to seeking recompense from the
Affinity Partnership over what we believe may amount to a breach of contract.''
The 1996 festival has been beset by problems in recent months including the
news that neither comedian Billy Connolly nor rock group Runrig were aware that
they were taking part in the programme of events, despite Mr Struthers
announcing it to the media.
In addition, hints were dropped that opera singer Dame Kiri Te Kanawa would be
singing at a special open air concert at Rugby Park, Kilmarnock, in the summer.
Her personal manager told The Herald that only one tentative approach had been
made to him which was never followed up.
Local organisations have complained at the lack of consultation or involvement,
and Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council have set up what amounts to an
emergency contingency fund for the year to ensure some events take place in the
region.
It is understood substantial changes in the running of the festival, including
a revamped committee and streamlined organisation, will be announced within two
weeks and that a major brewer is to unveil a sponsorship package.

SHINTY
PLAYERS throughout Scotland face a bleak start to 1996, with the first day's
play after the winter closedown, due on January 6, already in jeopardy.
Many pitches across the country are under up to a foot of snow, and with the
hard frost which has penetrated the ground making flooding the first serious
problem to be faced, it looks as if the fixtures card will be placed under
immediate pressure.
Camanachd Association officials had been pleased with progress to date, with
only four matches lost in the national premier league programme up until the
last day's play.
The snow came almost immediately after that, however, and fixtures officials
can now look forward to the new year with more than one reason for a headache.
Several traditional new year matches, as well as the central district trial
match which was scheduled for Saturday at Drumnadrochit, are already off.
The pitch at Drumnadrochit is covered by almost a foot of snow and one other
likely casualty is the new year game between Lovat and Beauly.
That is due to be played at Kiltarlity on January 2, but there is little
prospect of play.
More eager to play perhaps are the masons of Lodges 43 and 1200 in Lochaber,
who have a score to settle after last year's 2-2 draw which ended in
hand-shakes all round.
They are due to meet for a rematch at the Fort William swimming pool park on
January 2, at 1pm and are believed to be willing to play whatever the
conditions.
Also due to play at new near are the villagers of Heaste, who have revived the
traditional seasonal game in Skye in recent years.
Road conditions on the island are bad, however, and the revelry may be limited
to a few hardy locals who will maintain the tradition, if possible.
The cold weather, with temperatures plunging to minus 20 in some places, has
also hit the Fort William club off the field.
Leaking water in the clubhouse at An Aird has caused thousands of pounds worth
of damage, although this hasn't been allowed to interfere with the Christmas
parties and other occasions planned at the venue.
More likely to succeed, however, is North shinty development officer Niall
MacLennan, of Inverness, who has announced plans for an indoor participation
course early in the new year.
The course, which will offer young children the chance to improve their skills
through ``First Shinty'', the modified indoor version of the game, will run for
12 weeks from January 12 to March 29.
Sessions cost 70p each, and application forms can be obtained from the venue,
the Inverness Sports Centre at the Bught Park.
Camanachd Association administrator Alister MacIntyre has confirmed that from
the new year, weather permitting, the number of matches scheduled for play on
any weekend will be limited to the number of officials available, in a bid to
ease the burden on club officials, who may be organising games for which there
are no referees available.

Durban
CIVIL defence authorities issued a new flood warning today as weary police and
rescuers warned the death toll could top 300 in the South African Zulu
homeland's     double Christmas tragedy of flooding and violence.
Heavy rain and hail fell again today and the Pietermaritzburg local authority
warned residents of the ravaged Edendale valley at nightfall to be ready to
flee at short notice if the swollen Umsunduzi River burst its banks for a
second time.
Civil defence officials said the Unsunduzi was in spate and the Henley dam near
Pietermaritzburg was overflowing, threateneing a new flood.
Families, rescuers and police waded through fields of mud in search of 62
people missing since a Christmas Day flood known to have killed 124 people in
the valley west of the Indian Ocean port of Durban.
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, standing in for President Nelson Mandela who is
on holiday, visited the region and declared it a national disaster area.
``It is disastrous. If you look at it all it is unbelievable. I think the most
important thing now is the upkeep of the survivors and the collection of bodies
for burial,'' provincial premier Frank Mdlalose told Reuters.
Heavy rain fell as Mbeki toured the area. An official rushed away saying he had
heard that the Slangspruit River had burst its banks a second time and he had
to check it out.
South of Durban, at Port Shepstone, police said at least 135 people had died in
political and criminal violence since last Friday and it was possible that not
all the victims had been found.
The twin Christmas tragedies seemed likely to have claimed at least 300 lives
with further rains possible and politically driven violence still unchecked.
Police Commissioner George Fivaz said in a statement today he had sent police
reinforcements and independent investigators to the Port Shepstone area, where
at least 19 people were massacred on Christmas Day.
Police said more than 600 Zulus armed with spears, axes and guns swept through
rural villages near Port Shepstone, burning, killing and looting in what
appeared to be politically-motivated attacks.
Survivors told reporters that as they fled from an ``Impi'' - a Zulu column -
advancing towards their village, they ran straight into another marching
towards them from the opposite direction in a traditional Zulu battle tactic.
At least 19 people died in the attacks on homes of families of supporters of
Mandela's ruling African National Congress. Two of the 19 bodies were found
this morning.
Political analysts and human rights monitors said tribal chiefs in the province
usually waited to settle old scores during the festive season when Zulu men
working in other parts of the country traditionally returned home for
Christmas.
The ANC's KwaZulu-Natal provincial spokesman Dumisani Makhaye yesterday blamed
Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party for the
massacre.
But an Inkatha spokesman, Senator Phillip Powell, denied the allegation, saying
Inkatha members had been ``subjected to a wave of killing in the past three
months''.-Reuter.

A GENERATOR was yesterday flown to a remote Lewis village, without electricity
since Saturday, to aid a man with breathing difficulties.
It was needed to power two pieces of electronic equipment used to treat Mr
Harley Gillies, 59, in Breanish.
The coastguard helicopter, based at Stornoway, with two Hydro-Electric
engineers on board, transported the generator.
The machine, loaned by the islands council, was lowered to waiting neighbours
of Mr Gillies.
After a spell of treatment on his oxygen enriching machine, Mr Gillies, who is
retired, said: ``I feel very much better already.
``I can't thank the coastguards, Hydro-Electric, and the council enough for
what they have done for me.''
The generator will also power another machine which helps Mr Gillies breathe
while he is asleep.
A coastguard spokesman said it was not a life-threatening situation, but was a
job well done.

AS they left what was clearly not the first pub, a man said to his friend:
``Will we go to the second pub first or the first pub second?'' Given the way
it is becoming difficult to tell one shopping street from another as the chain
stores take over, it was reassuring to realise that people are still different.
When you overhear a conversation like that there is only one country, one city,
that you can be in.
It's always refreshing to return to Glasgow. Mind you, when the taxi driver
asked to take one to Babbity Bowster's heads off for somewhere called Chappit
Munchkins, or something like that, you begin to wonder how refreshed you want
to be. It was when we drove up a flyover and the university loomed on the
horizon that I realised something had gone wrong since the journey had started
at Central Station. He was contrite, but unabashed. ``The first mistake
today,'' he said. ``I never make more than one.''
To be fair he had switched off the meter and when the magical mystery tour
ended he only charged the proper fare.
But I am whingeing. However, as I said, it's refreshing to be back in Scotland.
Had the Von Trapp family been Scottish Julie Andrews would have ended up
singing The Hills are Alive to the Sound of Whingeing. The best bit of that I
heard all week was the man in Shetland on the radio who, after castigating the
electricity people for failing to exploit a three-hour weather window,
complained that it meant the people there had missed out on Christmas Eve
television. No mention of freezing to death, or not having electric light. Just
missing television, something that most people over Christmas would have
considered a blessing.
Then there was the story in The Herald about the STUC asking Michael Forsyth to
do more to support the Scottish film industry. There is nothing wrong with
that, but what they were asking was for him to get the Heritage Secretary,
Virginia Bottomley, to think again about the Government's decision to withdraw
from the Euroimages scheme. The withdrawal was announced in the Budget and
under the scheme which we joined in 1993 some 56 films have benefited.
NATURALLY the new approachable Mr Forsyth is giving the request full
consideration. I hope that includes taking a look at some of those 56 films.
Any of this year's Europuddings, above all Innocent Lies and All Men are Mortal
would repay a look.
At the Franco-British Film Festival in Dinard I met a very high-powered French
lady lawyer who was something influential in the European Script Fund, a source
of EU lolly for co-productions. I had some difficulty in explaining the concept
of a turkey to her, but when she eventually grasped it she was not amused. But
what can one make of a committee doling out our money to film-makers which is
not interested in the script but only the business plan. Making films is a
business, but without a script there is no business.
Allan Shiach was right in his Herald article yesterday when he urged the
Government to come up with a coherent strategy for the film industry, something
it has never had and something even the blandishments of Lord Attenborough, who
daringly called her darling, failed to make Mrs Thatcher bring about. Part of
the problem, and this does not apply to Mr Shiach, is that the people Ministers
turn to for advice are the very people who take the Euro cash and make those
appalling Europudding films nobody goes to see. If they did, there would be an
outcry at the way the money was being wasted.
Ken Loach's Land and Freedom was a rare exception to the rule when it comes to
co-productions. Mr Shiach blames its lack of success here on its distributors.
Mr Loach and his producer Rebecca O'Brien have argued their case forcefully
enough, but the fact is that his previous film, Ladybird Ladybird, in spite of
glowing reviews, failed to attract an audience. In Europe they may go to see a
film on the strength of the director's name, but here people want film stars,
and Mr Loach is a prophet with honour but not much profit in his own country.
I don't have the answers, although Mr Shiach has suggested some, but neither do
the Europudding-makers who tend to end up on the advisory committees Ministers
insist on setting up. I suspect that had Land and Freedom starred Chris
O'Donnell and Winona Ryder it might well have been distributed rather more
widely than it was, but then it would not have been a Ken Loach film.
Anyway, that's the end of my whinge. It really is refreshing to come back home.

A MAN was shot dead in front of his family in an attack on his house in west
Belfast last night.
Police said the 30-year-old man died when what appeared to be a shotgun was
fired through the window of the house in the republican Norglen Parade area.
The man's wife and children were in the house. They escaped without injury.
The murder follows two in the week before Christmas and another earlier in the
month.
The earlier murders were claimed by a previously unheard of group, Direct
Action Against Drugs, who warned more people were to be targeted.
The group is believed in security and political circles to be a cover name for
the IRA, being used to hold on to its control of republican areas.
The recent spate of murders have prompted calls from Unionists for the
Government to accept that the IRA ceasefire was at an end.
West Belfast MP, Dr Joe Hendron, SDLP, condemned the killing as ``a foul
murder''.
Earlier Sinn Fein warned that the Northern Ireland peace process was on the
verge of collapse and claimed the Government was anxious to return to war.
Peace could still be grasped but the hold on it was rapidly loosening, warned
party chairman Mitchel McLaughlin.
In one of the gloomiest assessments yet of the state of the peace process after
16 months of IRA ceasefire, he accused Britain of spoiling for a fight and not
being serious about a lasting peace.
Addressing a rally in the County Fermanagh border town of Rosea, Mr McLaughlin
said: ``It is becoming daily more apparent that the British Government has no
intention whatsoever of advancing, or, indeed, of maintaining the peace process
in Ireland.''
He accused some elements within the Government of being worried about their
slender parliamentary majority, preferring to cosset the Unionists rather than
address the issues necessary for lasting peace.
``Other members within the British Cabinet are undoubtedly seeking to force a
rerun of the war on terms which they imagine are much more favourable to their
side.
``We are, all of us, standing on the verge of a disaster created by another
lethal British miscalculation.''
He warned: ``The IRA has not surrendered. The conditions for peace are still
present, but so are the conditions for renewed war.''
The onus was on the Prime Minister, he said.
``Peace is still available and peace is still possible. Even at this late hour
John Major has the power to rescue both our peoples from looming disaster. A
short statement of serious intent, a simple phone-call, can pull us all back
from the brink.''
But he warned: ``The British Government, or for that matter any British
Government to come, will find that the nationalists of Ireland are not in the
business of surrender''.
What they wanted was the release of prisoners from British jails, the removal
of British injustice and inequality and the search for an agreement among all
the people of Ireland ``on how we govern ourselves''.
Matters are likely to come to a head next month when the international
commission produces its report on how to resolve the stalemate over the
decommissioning of terrorist weapons. Britain insists the IRA must start
getting rid of its weapons before Sinn Fein can enter the negotiations on
Ulster's future. The IRA refuses, insisting that could come about only as part
of a final agreed settlement.

MP makes call
for beds inquiry
AN alleged shortage of intensive-care hospital beds throughout Tayside has led
to a call by the East Angus MP, Mr Andrew Welsh, for an urgent governmental
inquiry.
Scottish Health Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton recently denied there was
a problem, but a prominent surgeon is said to possess clinical evidence that
patients have suffered through the postponement of surgery. In demanding an
inquiry, Mr Welsh said the Government was putting people's lives at risk.
Men arrested
TWO men in their late teens and early 20s have been arrested in connection with
the Boxing Day mugging of an 83-year-old widow. Mrs Evelyn Stanford remains in
a critical condition at Wolverhampton's Royal Hospital.
Grand occasion
THE Princess Royal will be at Ayr Racecourse in April to open a #1.65m
extension to the Members Grandstand. The ceremony will take place during the
Scottish Grand National.
Generous offer
A CLYDEBANK councillor is urging community groups to apply for a slice of the
council's #600,000 general services surplus before it merges with Dumbarton in
the spring. But Labour councillors have toned down the offer by SNP Councillor
Jim McElhill, saying the money is not exactly surplus and has to last until
March 31.
Rape charge
A PLUMBER charged with raping a sex-change woman was yesterday remanded in
custody until January 3. John Mathews, 46, of Ufton Nervet, Berkshire, is
alleged to have raped the woman near Pangbourne, Berkshire, on Christmas Day.
Cliff search
SENIOR pupil Andrew Smith, 18, missing for more than two weeks, had been the
victim of classroom bullying, his father said yesterday. Police launched a
helicopter search yesterday after his bicycle and back-pack were found hidden
on a cliff-top at Swanage, Dorset.
Engineering rises
PAY settlements in Scotland's engineering industry averaged out at 3.5% for the
12 months to December, according to the employer's support organisation,
Scottish Engineering.
Parking fears
THREE in five Scottish women are afraid to park in multi-storeys, a survey to
find Britain's safest car park has found. It revealed that 10% of women were
concerned when parking in the street, 50% feared being stranded by a car
breakdown, and 20% wanted female-only parking.

<HEADLINE>RAC warning after jump-leads blind driver</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>2</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>974667798</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
DRIVERS using jump-leads to start their cars have been warned to follow the
makers' guidelines with extra care by the RAC, after an accident left a
motorist blind yesterday.
The motorist was leaning over his battery holding jump leads when a spark
caused an explosion.
The RAC warned that during jump-lead starting, or battery recharging, explosive
gases can be given off. Yet 20% of motorists are unaware of the danger.
``Jump starting a car is not as simple as it used to be. Engine management
systems have become increasingly complicated,'' said RAC head of campaigns
Edmund King.
``By following manufacturer guidelines and the RAC's basic advice, motorists
can avoid thousands of pounds worth of damage or the risk of serious personal
injury.''
The RAC said cold snaps put a heavy drain on car batteries which operate best
at temperatures of 75F. In sub-zero temperatures, batteries work at only 80-85%
of capacity.
The warning is part of the RAC's national battery awareness campaign. It began
last month with an exercise in which more than 2000 discarded and potentially
dangerous batteries were collected.
The RAC last night also issued tips for motorists forced to travel during the
present record freeze-up.
Although they were advised not to venture out unless absolutely necessary, the
RAC said that a series of sensible precautions would lessen the hazards of
driving in ice and snow.
Many of the checks should be carried out the previous evening. They can be
doubly difficult in the dark, early hours of the morning.
q Make sure that you have the correct amount of anti-freeze in your cooling
system. A frozen engine can cause hundreds of pounds worth of damage. Always
check coolant when the engine is cold.
q Check the condition of all hoses. If they feel brittle or spongy, have them
replaced.
q Your battery must be in top condition. Even a reasonable battery can give up
when having to start a very cold engine.
q Fill the screen washer bottle using an anti-freezing agent.
q Tyres, including the spare, must be at their correct pressure. Deflating
them does not aid traction in snow. If tread depth is in any doubt, have the
tyres changed.
q Cover the windscreen with a bin liner or sheets of newspaper to stop the
worst of the frost overnight.
q Condensation inside the car can cause misting up and even icing inside. Keep
a chamois leather handy as well as a plastic scraper, both inside and out of
the car.
q Check all lights, replacing bulbs where necessary. Clean your number plates
and replace windscreen wiper blades if they have been in use for more than a
year.
q Make certain you have enough fuel to reach your destination and for the
return journey. Fewer filling stations are open over the holiday period.
q Keep warm clothing in your car - as well as a shovel, a tow rope, and some
old carpet - in case you become stranded.
q Drive slowly if conditions are at all suspect. Braking distances multiply on
wet or snowy roads. Watch out for black ice, usually impossible to detect until
it is too late.
q Use dipped headlights if visibility is at all impaired.
q If climbing a hill in the snow, use as high a gear as is practicable. In too
low a gear, the wheels will spin out of control.

TRIVIA quiz experts take note. Who in Scottish football are identical, yet by
their own admission, are chalk and cheese when it comes to the national game?
Who have played for, and now have management posts with, the same club?
We're not finished yet, by a long way. Their football careers have followed -
and it is hardly surprising - a parallel course. But there is the difference
that one of them battered in the goals, the other either created or stopped
them.
Off the field, one has his own business specialising in ``human resources.''
The other also has his own business - the Silver Tassie at Lochgelly - where
human resource or resourcefulness is put severely to the test, especially when
a good lady of one of the public house's customers inquired by telephone
whether he is present on the premises. The phrase ``porkie pies'' must have
taken root in such hostelries.
However, I digress. Let's talk about a kingdom - Fife; the Campbells' kingdom -
Dunfermline Athletic; and the cathedral city of Brechin.
Let's discuss Ian and Dick Campbell - twins, identical apart from the fact that
Dick wears a moustache, and Ian does not. Twins who have the same looks that
have driven picture caption writers to distraction trying to identify who's who
over the years. They have the telepathy associated with such a close bond, but
they treat the national game differently.
Ian is the calm side of the story. Dick - Richard, as his twin calls him -
almost happily admits to ``going over the top'' on occasions. An
understatement, believe me. While Ian sits in the stand taking a calm, almost
judicious view of what is happening on the park, Dick - the elder by 20 minutes
when they were born in November 22, 1953 - at times lets his assistant
manager's enthusiasm get the better of him.
Anyone who doubts this need only refer to standside linesmen for authenticity.
Mind you, a certain Bert Paton, chief at Dunfermline of the Clan Campbell,
occasionally makes visible reference to decisions he feels have gone against
his team.
He and the Campbells go back a long way. And, after all, they do share a family
connection. They're Fifers.
So to the brothers, born at Cowdenbeath as part of a family numbering seven -
four boys and three girls - to parents Elizabeth and Alex. Of the sons, Peter
at 48 is the eldest, then come the twins and then Duncan. Fitba daft, all of
them.
The twins several times have played in the same team - both amateur and
professional - beginning with Juveniles Townhill. However, in 1969, Dick moved
to Dundee United for a brief spell as a midfielder or defender, and as he
joked: ``I became home-sick.''
There followed five years or so with Cowdenbeath before he moved to Dunfermline
in 1975. Ross County in the Highland League beckoned under manager Ian McNeill,
then four or five more seasons - he admits that his memory for exact dates is a
bit iffy - at Brechin, back to Dunfermline, player-coach in the early 80s at
East Stirlingshire, at Raith Rovers when Gordon Wallace was manager, then back
to Brechin City where John Ritchie was in charge.
Pressure of business led him to go out of the game for six months before
joining Paton at Rosyth Juniors. He again returned to Dunfermline when Jocky
Scott was in charge, and then rejoined Paton when he was made manager at East
End Park.
When Dick Campbell reads this, he will feel uncomfortable. Those who know his
outgoing manner may find that difficult to understand, but he admitted: ``I
don't look back. It's incredibly unlucky. I'm quite a superstitious person.''
Over to Ian. There is a remarkable difference in style. Where Richard - as Ian
calls him - happily admits that he says what he thinks, but rarely thinks
before saying it, Ian has brought business management skills to his part-time
football career.
He attended Jordanhill College on a physical education course, taught at
Kirkcaldy High School, and throughout his football career, he has brought that
type of resource into the game, whether it be teaching youngsters, scoring 170
goals for Brechin - still a club record - being operations director at C R
Smith's double glazing company, where he worked for 10 years, or being managing
director now of his own company, Avenue Scotland.
``We are human-resource specialists,'' was his simple description. ``We manage
change in things like corporate services and recruitment.''
Perfect for a guy who still is part-time as far as football is concerned in a
career spanning spells with Dunfermline, Cowdenbeath, Brechin for eight years -
all as a player - eventually back to Dunfermline as a player-coach with Jim
Leishman in charge, during which time the East End Park side were promoted in
successive seasons from second to premier division.
As happens, when the poet Jim's famous words of half-time wisdom failed to
inspire, he went out the door. So did Ian Campbell.
Ian is back at Dunfermline as reserve team coach, happy with the memories,
especially those of when he played in the same teams as Richard. But as he
says: ``I prefer the low-key style. I'm passionate about the club, and only too
glad to help out.'' He's not doing too badly, either. His reserve side have
lost only once his season.
Mind you, like all families, even twins get up to a bit of mischief-making, and
in this case Richard has created his own wee bit of fun. Beginning on the
serious note of: ``It is magnificent to have Ian - he has strengths I don't
have, and ``Pink'' is not averse to giving me a slap over the head while
travelling back from a game when I have gone over the top.''
Pink? ``Oh, didn't you know that's Ian's nickname? When he was scoring all
those goals with Brechin, he was called after the Pink Panther, because the
opposition rarely could keep him down or even catch him.''
I may be wrong, but there could be another slap on the head for that one.

<TEXT>
A YOUTH who killed a 16-year-old with a stolen knife was ordered to be detained
for 12 years yesterday.
Only weeks after finishing two sentences for assault James Morrison, 19,
stabbed the boy six times.
He plunged the knife into Jamie Docherty's jugular vein and he bled to death
within minutes, the High Court in Glasgow heard.
Morrison, of Findlayson Drive, Kilmarnock, killed the boy with a knife he stole
during a housebreaking a week earlier.
He was originally charged with murder, but admitted a reduced charge of
culpable homicide yesterday.
Advocate-depute William Totten told Lord Hamilton that he accepted there had
been ``minimal'' provocation by the victim and another three youths.
A jury heard how Docherty, of MacNaughton Drive, Kilmarnock, punched and kicked
Morrison in the town's London Road in August this year.
Mr Totten said that Docherty bled to death in the street before ambulancemen
arrived.
He said that Morrison, who admitted two other assaults, had shown no remorse
for the killing and had told police a ``pack of lies''.
Mr Totten said that only days after completing nine-month and six-month periods
of detention in a Young Offenders' Institution Morrison attacked and robbed a
16-year-old boy.
Along with another youth he abducted the boy as he walked along the road and
forced him into a side street.
Mr Totten said: ``They made the boy sit on a wall and then Morrison punched him
in the face and robbed him of his watch, designer sweater, and #8.''
Mr Hugh Matthews, QC, defending, said Morrison had been placed in a home when
he was nine and had a ``terrible upbringing'' and had been assaulted by his
stepfather.

Korean store
owner jailed
SEOUL: The owner of a South Korean department store which collapsed in June,
killing more than 500 people, was convicted yesterday for the country's worst
peace-time disaster and jailed for 10!s years. Lee Joon, 73, owner and founder
of the Sampoong Department Store, was found guilty of criminal negligence. His
42-year-old son, Han-sang, the store's president, was sentenced to seven years
on the same charge.
The court also sentenced Lee Choong-woo, a former chief administrator of the
residential area where the store was located, to three years in jail on bribery
charges. Relatives of the defendants wept as the sentences were read out.
Tribal feud
DARWIN: About 200 aborigines, some armed with boomerangs and spears, clashed
for several hours in a remote town yesterday as part of a tribal feud, police
said. Fighting broke out in Wadeye, about 140 miles southwest of Darwin, after
thousands of cans of beer were stolen from a local bar.
Mass poisoning
BEIJING: A mother and son were sentenced to death for the mass poisoning of
villagers in southern China, Beijing-backed newspaper Ta Kung Pao said
yesterday. Du Runqiong claimed she was driven by spirits to rid the world of
bad people, the court heard. Eighteen people died and 160 needed hospital
treatment.
Trekking on
OSLO: Borge Ousland, the Norwegian polar adventurer, who set a new record last
week by skiing alone to the South Pole, is not resting on his laurels. The
32-year-old skier now is ready to continue all the way across Antarctica,
alone, after digging up more supplies buried in the snow in 1990 by a previous
expedition, Norwegian media reported.
Pope `better'
ROME: Pope John Paul, whose Christmas was disrupted by a bout of influenza,
left the Vatican by helicopter yesterday for the papal residence of
Castelgandolfo south of Rome, Vatican officials said. The 75-year-old pontiff's
next public engagement is in Rome on December 31, when he is due to lead a New
Year's Eve thanksgiving service. ``He is better,'' a Vatican official said.
Waning support
CANBERRA: More than one in two Australians want an Australian head of state,

Arles
A LAWYER who gambled in a 1965 property deal that an elderly woman would soon
die, only to see her live to become the world's oldest person, has himself died
aged 77.
Andre-Francois Raffray was buried today in the southern French city of Arles
after dying on Christmas Day, a secretary in his law firm said.
The woman, Jeanne Calment, celebrated Christmas with a meal at an Arles hotel,
looking forward to her 121st birthday on February 21.
When Calment was 90, Raffray, then 47, agreed to pay her a ``rent'' of #300
month until she died, on condition he would inherit her house in Arles, a
system common in France.
Over the next 30 years, Raffray paid Calment more than #120,000, three times
the value of the house.
``We all make bad deals in life,'' Calment joked to Raffray on her 120th
birthday.
Calment reached 120 years 238 days on October 17, passing the previous greatest
authenticated age of 120 years 237 days achieved by Japan's Schigechiyo Izumi,
who died in 1986.-Reuter.

Harry McLevy, trade unionist; born August 28, 1936, died December 24, 1995
HARRY McLEVY was a fine human being. Kindness shone through everything he did.
He would remind me of good things I'd said, or written, a couple of years ago,
or 40 years ago, and yes, our friendship went back that long. He never seemed
to remember when I, or his other friends, had got it wrong. His judgment was
flawed by a generous spirit that looked only for the best in people. Oh that we
were all so flawed.
Harry's beliefs never degenerated into dogma which seals the mind within a
prison of our own making. When he died on Christmas Eve, Harry was Scottish
regional officer of the engineering union which, in its halcyon days, must have
been one of the most democratic institutions in the world. Every official was
elected and re-elected, or not re-elected.
The union had a national committee of 52 members, who took all policy and
strategic financial decisions, and was also the union's rules revision
committee. No full-time official, including the president, had a vote on this
committee.
It would sometimes meet for weeks at a time. In the 1970s Harry, Davie Todd
from Brechin, Jim Airlie, and myself, were members of the national committee,
then a battleground between the best-organised right and left-wing groupings in
the British labour movement.
The ongoing democracy meant there were always elections going on, without
respite. The right-wing and left-wing machines, by necessity, became
predominantly electoral machines. The union and its politics suffered in the
sense that living standards, the quality of life for all trade unionists and
their families, were now determined, as much by political decisions as by union
negotiations. Yet the union activists were too often immersed in internal union
feuding to see the wood for the trees.
This was put on the agenda very forcibly in Scotland with the UCS work in of
the early seventies. It inspired a political debate which transcended party
politics. About democracy not just being the right to a vote, but a right to
work, and other basic rights. This brought a cultural dimension to trade
unionism. Harry was in his element.
At that time left members of the AEU national committee were always booked into
some downmarket boarding house, which might have been all right for a night or
a weekend but harrowing when for longer. You know the kind of place. The
pervasive smell of left-over cabbage. An interior like the TV series Rising
Damp. The landlord might even look like Rigsby.
We rebelled. The four of us rented a flat, all mod cons. Davie had volunteered
to do whatever cooking was required. I best remember the meals at ``home''.
Davie's culinary repertoire was good but rather limited. Totties and mince was
his pice de resistance. We hammed it up. Candles. Wine. Mulling over the
problems of the world while dispatching a post-prandial brandy. As they say,
nothing is too good for the workers.
Harry revelled in the camaraderie. He was a Dundonian. Born in August 1936. His
father was a plater's helper in Caledon shipyards, later an engineer in Bonar
Longs. Harry became an engineer and his brother Frank a welder. Dad was a trade
unionist. His sons were too.
Harry from his apprentice days stood out. He became an outstanding trade union
leader. His vision of a wider role for trade unions found expression through
his work for the STUC, particularly in his work for a Scottish Parliament,
through which the Scottish people, he believed, could once again claim some
right of control over their own destiny.
Harry had been a communist. For years we had both been members of the party's
national executive. He was always in the liberal wing, and left the party in
the mid-eighties to join the Labour Party.
He was an utterly good man. His concern for others was manifest. His family
must be devastated, as are all his friends. Susan, Graeme, Sean, and Kevin,
their mother Susan, and Doris, who brought so much love to the last 18 years of
his life, might be able to draw some comfort from the knowledge that those of
us privileged to have known him, share their grief.
An appreciation by
JIMMY REID

Lachlan Ronald Duncan Mackintosh, clan chief; born June 27, 1928, died December
25, 1995
THE Mackintosh clan were yesterday mourning the death of their chief. Lachlan
Mackintosh, who had been in poor health after suffering from kidney failure
earlier this year, died on Christmas Day at his home, Moy Hall, Tomatin,
Inverness-shire. The 67-year-old former naval lieutenant-commander had spent
most of his last months on a dialysis machine.
Lachlan Mackintosh was prominent in public life in the Scottish Highlands,
being Lord Lieutenant of Inverness, Lochaber, Badenoch, and Strathspey since
1985 as well as chief of the Mackintosh clan. The son of naval hero
Vice-Admiral Lachlan Mackintosh of Mackintosh, he was educated at the Royal
Navy College, Dartmouth, and succeeded his father as clan chief in 1957.
He was vice-president of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association
from 1969-71, a member of Inverness County Council from 1970-75, and a member
of Highland Regional Council from 1975 until his death. He was chairman of the
council's roads and transport committee from 1990 until he stepped down because
of ill health in the summer of this year. He also served as chairman, Inverness
Prison Visiting Committee, from 1973 to 1986.
Duncan McPherson, convener of Highland Regional Council, said of him: ``Public
life in the Highlands has lost one of its most distinguished representatives.''

James Edward Meade, economist and Nobel Prize winner; born June 23, 1907, died
December 22, 1995
JAMES Edward Meade, a Nobel Prize winner in economics, has died at the age of
88.
In 1977 Meade became the joint winner of the Nobel Prize in economic science,
along with former Swedish commerce minister Bertil Ohlin. They were honoured
for contributions to the theory of international trade. Meade had met Ohlin
just once, but some of Meade's studies had been viewed in the economics
community as sequels to Ohlin's work.
Meade was riding a bus to a university appointment when news of his prize
reached Britain. ``By the time I arrived, everyone seemed to know about the
prize but myself,'' Meade recalled.
After studying at Oxford and Cambridge, he lectured in economics at Oxford from
1930 to 1937. He worked in Geneva as a member of the economics section of the
League of Nations, precursor to the United Nations, from 1938 to 1940. He then
held several British government economic posts during the Second World War
until 1947.
Meade spent a decade as Professor of Commerce at the London School of
Economics, before working as a professor of political economy at Cambridge from
1957 to 1968. He also played a major role in GATT, the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, that has now been replaced by the World Trade Organisation
in Geneva; and he wrote extensively about economic theory.
His recent book, Full Employment Regained, published by Cambridge University
Press, suggested more economic planning might help undo some of what Meade
viewed as the negativism of 16 years of Conservative Party rule in Britain.
Meade is survived by his widow, Margaret; four children, Tom, Charlotte,
Bridget and Carol; eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

Washington
SYRIAN and Israeli diplomats were meeting today at a secluded conference centre
50 miles from here, hoping to complete the last major piece of the Middle East
peace process.
The American government chose the Wye Plantation, a group of houses on 1000
acres of farmland, because it is conveniently close to Washington and because
the press can be kept out.
The two sides have been talking on and off for years, ever since the Madrid
conference in October, 1991, when the Israelis first officially met Arab
delegations, including the Palestinians and Syrians.
That event was followed by fruitless meetings in Washington: the last round of
talks between Israel and Syria broke down last June.
Things have changed since 1991. Israel has made peace with the Palestinians and
Jordan, and Syria has been left behind.
After the assassination of Yitzak Rabin, President Assad seems to have realised
that the best hope for recovering the Golan Heights lay in cutting a deal with
the new prime minister, Shimon Peres, and acceded to American pressure to
resume the negotiations.
The proposal, once again, is that Israel give up the heights in exchange for a
complete peace agreement. In the past, the Syrians always insisted that Israel
must first withdraw from territory it occupied in 1967. It would then consider
whether or not to conclude a permanent peace treaty.
President Assad has now apparently conceded that the two agreements must be
simultaneous.
There remain considerable difficulties: what sort of international force will
police the Golan after the Israeli withdrawal, to ensure that it remains
demilitarised? Will that force be allowed to maintain Israel's elaborate
electronic intelligence apparatus now perched on top of Mount Hermon?
Where, exactly, is the boundary? After the 1948 war, the ceasefire agreement
designated certain areas as demiltarised. Israel subsequently occupied them,
and says they are part of Israel. Syria claims them now.
The 13,000 Israeli settlers who have made the desert bloom on the Golan would
have to leave. They are, of course, bitterly opposed to the suggestion. Israel
would also lose its only ski resort.
Peace with Lebanon would follow an Israeli-Syrian treaty, and then other Arab
states, led by Saudi Arabia, would be expected to recognise Israel and exchange
ambassadors.
The talks will last until the end of next week. Then there will be a pause, to
be followed, perhaps, by further American diplomacy and, if all goes well, with
another signing ceremony at the White House, with President Assad and Mr Peres
at last shaking hands on their peace treaty.
Meanwhile, Israeli troops in Ramallah ended 28 years of occupation in a matter
of minutes today, completing the handover to Palestinian rule of six West Bank
towns under a historic accord.
Hundreds of residents waved flags, cheered and hurled stones at departing
Israeli jeeps as Palestinian police entered the town's police station and
raised the Palestinian flag.
``We have taken over,'' the Palestinian governor of Ramallah, Abu Firas
Liftawi, said outside the police station.
In Gaza, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat told reporters: ``We praise the honest
implementation of the withdrawal process from the West Bank and I thank Mr
(Israeli Prime Minister Shimon) Peres for this.''
Israeli cabinet minister Yossi Beilin hailed the pullout as an important
milestone in Israeli-Palestinian relations.
Later today a contingent of 700 Palestinian police left the self-rule enclave
of Jericho to join the forces already in Ramallah, Palestinian sources said.
They said some 120 others crossed from Jordan to Jericho, the first contingent
of 5000 Israel has agreed to allow into the West Bank. In all there will be
12,000 Palestinian police in the West Bank. There are 18,000 police in Gaza.
The town of Ramallah, just eight miles north of Jerusalem, has extra
significance to many Palestinians.
``Redeployment from Ramallah has special importance. It has traditionally been
an economic and political centre and it is very close to Jerusalem,'' said
Marwan Barghouti, a prominent member of Arafat's Fatah organisation.
Ten minutes after the Palestinians took over the police station, they moved
into Ramallah's military headquarters, surprising everyone with the speed of
the takeover from Israel.
Earlier today the Israeli government said it would release between 1000 and
1100 Palestinian prisoners out of about 5000 it still holds. Israeli army radio
said they would be set free next week.-Reuter.

THERE is no sign of a respite in the big freeze, with weathermen warning of
worse to come in the next few days.
The coldest place in Scotland yesterday was Altnaharra in Sutherland, where the
temperature plummeted to -20.7C and was expected to drop to -25C last night. It
was followed closely by Tulloch Bridge, near Fort William, at -20.5C.
Glasgow is also facing a deeper freeze with temperatures expected to drop to
20C below.
The city already suffered its coldest night on record when the mercury fell to
almost -19C on Tuesday night. The River Clyde froze in the city centre for the
first time since 1962.
The temperature was colder than Moscow's -15C, Kiev's -6C and New York's -9C
and even came close to Helsinki, which recorded -22C.
Weather experts blamed the cold spell on air currents from the Arctic Circle
and predict it will continue until the weekend.
A spokesman for Glasgow Weather Centre said: ``It is a legacy of very cold
northerly winds at the end of last week which came from the Arctic Circle and
probably the North Pole. There is very little wind and so there is nothing to
push the cold air away.''
He warned that temperatures of around -20C in Glasgow would again be felt
tonight and tomorrow night.
Forecasters also fear there will be a heavy snowfall in southern and central
Scotland during the weekend.
One resident of a remote area, preparing to face another night of freezing
temperatures, did not need a neighbouring building to tell her how cold it was.
Ms Anne Owen, of Burnside, Tulloch, lives near the automatic Met Office station
at Tulloch Bridge.
Tulloch, 22 miles from Fort William, traditionally features in the list of
extreme weather: this summer, it frequently boasted Scotland's highest
temperature, well into the eighties.
When Ms Owen, and her partner, Mr Dean Carpenter, returned from spending the
Christmas period with relatives in Fife, she discovered the mercury had dropped
to the opposite end of the scale and eight inches of snow had fallen.
``We found that all our bottled drinks had frozen solid, along with full hot
water bottles and the five gallon container of water we keep for emergencies.''
The couple, who are living in temporary accommodation on the site of the
derelict cottage they are planning to restore, donned several layers of
clothing and kept their gas fire on throughout Tuesday night and yesterday to
melt their water supplies.
Ms Owen, a craftworker who moved north from Wales three years ago, said:
``Every winter I have been here has been colder than the one before.'' She
added: ``We cannot do anything outside until the thaw comes.''
The Met Office prediction of even colder times ahead suggest she will have to
wait.

<HEADLINE>Scottish negative equity total at #6m</HEADLINE>

THE Labour Party yesterday claimed that a new survey carried out on its behalf
showed that 5000 people in Scotland now had homes worth, on average, #1200 less
than they paid for them.
In total the negative equity for houses in Scotland currently stands at #6m,
according to the study carried out by the financial institution, UBS Global
Research.
The average negative equity in Scotland of #1200 per household is more than the
North-west England (#1100); North of England (#800); Yorkshire (#700); and West
Midlands (#700). The 5000 people affected is 2000 up on a similar study carried
out last year.
The size of the problem north of the Border came as the Chartered Institute of
Housing predicted a rise in repossessions for home owners who lose their jobs,
but who in the past would have been covered by an income support safety net.
However a spokesman for the Conservative Party in Scotland took issue with the
new survey.
A party spokesman said: ``This survey disregards the fact that in 1979 a third
of the Scottish population were home owners. Now in 1995 over 55% of Scots own
their homes.
``We are pursuing policies of low inflation and low interest rates and this is
the best way to secure a long-term stable housing market for Scotland.''
However Labour's Shadow Housing Minister, Mr Nick Raynsford, warned that the
prospects of an improvement in the housing market next year were fragile and he
attacked Mr Major for presiding over record levels of repossession and negative
equity.
``Rather than helping homeowners in difficulty, John Major has cut mortgage tax
relief and reduced help to unemployed homeowners. This has thrown hundreds of
thousands of ordinary families out of their homes and chopped thousands off the
value of people's homes,'' said Mr Raynsford.
According to the survey Scotland, with #6m of negative equity, is the least
affected area of the country followed by Yorkshire with a total of #20m. Worst
hit was the affluent South-east of England with #2500m being wiped off the
house prices in the area. Badly affected also was Greater London where #1100m
was taken off the value of houses.
The end-of-year survey by the Chartered Institute of Housing showed a rising
number of houses being repossessed following the withdrawal in October of
income support for mortgage repayments from owners who become unemployed or
suffer long-term health problems.
Only three out of the 15 building societies questioned had already implemented
policies aimed at people previously covered by income support for mortgage
interest payments.
Two societies said they had not responded in any way to the income support
changes, while the remaining 10 acknowledged the Government's wish to promote
private provision and had informed customers about ISMI withdrawal although new
insurance packages were not yet in place.

<HEADLINE>French face renewed condemnation over latest testing at South Pacific atoll Anger over fifth nuclear blast</HEADLINE>

Paris
FRANCE staged the fifth in its series of bitterly-disputed nuclear weapons
tests in the South Pacific today, a Defence Ministry spokesman said.
The spokesman said the underground explosion took place at Mururoa Atoll in
French Polynesia. (21.30 GMT).
The blast, equivalent to less than 30 kilotonnes of conventional explosives,
was designed to improve France's ability to simulate nuclear tests on computers
It was the fifth in a series that broke a 1992 moratorium on French nuclear
testing. The first took place on September 5, the second on October 2, the
third on October 27 and the fourth on November 21.
Press reports have said the test had first been scheduled for December 22 when
it would have coincided with sensitive talks between the French government and
unions after a crippling three-week public sector strike.
The reports said Prime Minister Alain Juppe asked President Jacques Chirac to
delay it until after Christmas.
Chirac says the tests are needed to validate a new warhead for France's
submarine-based missiles and acquire the ability to simulate tests on computer.
He has promised to sign a treaty banning nuclear tests forever once the series
is completed.
Chirac says France will probably conduct six tests, down from the eight
originally planned, and Defence Minister Charles Millon has said the series
will end in February.
Chirac, who is to visit Washington on February 1, denies he is cutting short
the series because of an international outcry against the tests.
In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Julie Reside expressed
disappointment that France was continuing to conduct nuclear tests.
``We have supported a temporary ban on all nuclear testing and would like to
see other nuclear powers support such a ban as well,'' she said.
``We're disappointed that France does continue to conduct (nuclear) tests.''
A White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the test did
not come as a surprise.
``We have expressed our concern that they are going on with these tests, and
again we regret that they felt the need to continue their testing, despite the
fact that they have assured us that this will be terminated in the early part
of next year,'' the official said.
New Zealand said today that France's reputation in the Pacific had sunk to an
all-time low with the latest test in French Polynesia.
``France is its own worst enemy,'' Prime Minister Jim Bolger said in a
statement.
``France has defied world opinion through continued testing. Its reputation in
the Pacific is at an all-time low. When the tests are over, France will have to
rebuild its credentials in the region. It has a long way to go.''
France, despite a chorus of international condemnation, insists the tests pose
no danger to the environment. It says they are needed to validate a new warhead
for submarine-based missiles and improve the ability to simulate tests by
computer.
Bolger said French ambassador Jacques le Blanc would again be called in to
receive a strong protest, as he has after every previous test.
Officials said he would be asked to meet a senior Foreign Ministry
representative in Wellington tomorrow.
``We will remind France that the United Nations General Assembly, in a formal
resolution, has just deplored continued testing and called for its immediate
end,'' Bolger said.
``France's actions are unacceptable. This latest test flies in the face of
world public opinion which is moving, ever more firmly, towards the view that
nuclear weapons should be eliminated.''
New Zealand has helped to lead international opposition to the French tests. It
sent a small navy ship to Mururoa to shepherd protest yachts at the start of
the series and it launched an unsuccessful legal challenge in the International
Court of Justice.
Bolger again called on President Jacques Chirac, who has indicated there will
be six tests, to make this one the last.
``If France is to rebuild its standing in this part of the world, it must start
by announcing the end of its misguided testing programme,'' he said.
``I, and all New Zealanders, now call on President Chirac to take that decision
without further delay.''
A spokesman for environmental group Greenpeace in Tahiti said the latest test
was a fresh snub to the local population.
Marc Defourneaux told the New Zealand Press Association: ``The local people
feel totally humiliated.
"It is like they are in mourning for someone who has died. Every time there is
a test it is just another humiliation to them as an indigenous
people.''
The latest test was greeted with anger tonight by British opposition parties
and anti-nuclear campaigners.
Labour said the test was ``unnecessary'' and risked causing environmental
damage while the Liberal Democrats accused the French of ignoring world opinion.
Both parties attacked the British Government for its continuing refusal to
condemn the test programme.
Labour's Shadow Defence David Clark said that it was now time for the French to
draw a line under the current programme and declare it        over.
``It is a disgrace. These tests are unnecessary and can be simulated in a
laboratory. I would like to think the French would end 1995 by ending this
series of tests.''
He urged the British Government to add its voice to the worldwide condemnation
of the test programme.
The Liberal Democrats' defence and foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell
said there was no scientific or military justification for the latest test.
``Jacques Chirac has yet again shown himself to be impervious both to French
domestic and international opinion,'' he said.--PA/Reuter

<HEADLINE>Death on Rock families paid legal costs Heseltine overruled by Majorp</HEADLINE>

MR Major has overruled his deputy Michael Heseltine by insisting that #38,700
should be paid to cover the legal costs of three families of IRA terrorists.
They fought a case through the European Court of Human Rights on the grounds
that the SAS had acted illegally in killing their unarmed relatives in a
firefight in Gibraltar seven years ago.
The decision to pay the legal costs was being seen by right-wingers in the Tory
Party as a payout to extremists.
At the same time it was being regarded by others as an indication of how far
the Prime Minister is prepared to go to ensure the peace process in Ireland
should progress.
The money was quietly paid out only after the parliamentary recess began and
was leaked when cheques appeared amid the Christmas cards of those most closely
involved.
Family members of the dead terrorists - Mairead Farrell, Sean Savage, and
Daniel McCann - saw it as admission that their relatives were murdered by
British special forces.
Last night in Whitehall that interpretation was being totally dismissed.
Instead it was said there was a legal obligation on Britain to follow decisions
of the courts.
However, the Ministry of Defence has been ordered that it must pay the bill for
the costs out of its budget.
The collective Cabinet decision to pay up is an embarrassment for Mr Heseltine,
himself a former Defence Secretary. At the time of the original ruling of the
Court of Human Rights he declared: ``We will not be swayed or deterred in any
way by this ludicrous decision of the court.''
Confirmation that the Government had caved in and would pay the legal costs -
yesterday was the last day the court had given it - is a further indication of
how embarrassing all of this is for the Conservative Party.
Mr Heseltine branded the original judgment of the human rights court as ``a
disgraceful slur''. At the time journalists, briefed by high sources, predicted
that Britain might defy the ruling by refusing to pay the fine.
Some newspapers suggested the United Kingdom might even pull out of an
organisation it was instrumental in setting up in the first place. Yesterday
Government sources declared that this was pure speculation by the media at the
time. No Minister had suggested pulling out, not least Mr Heseltine.
The UK was the first nation to put its signature to the establishment of the
Court of Human Rights.
Last night it emerged it was argued in Cabinet that it would be perverse to
pull out at this stage when former Soviet Union states were considering joining
. . . even more so when there were indications that Bosnia too might eventually
accept the court's jurisdiction on human rights despite allegations of war
crimes against leaders.

NATO's Bosnian peace drive came under attack from the weather today when flash
floods hit a French Foreign Legion camp and threatened to delay the building of
a bridge crucial for a US troop build-up.
Helicopters plucked some 60 Legionnaires to safety when a tented camp for 1000
paratroops outside the southern Bosnian town of Mostar was engulfed by the
flooded River Neretva.
Nearby bridges were swept away and men of the renowned French fighting unit
were forced to take to nearby rooftops to await rescue, but no-one was reported
hurt.
It was the first natural disaster to strike the alliance's biggest military
operation in 50 years since it took over Bosnian peace enforcement from a
toothless UN organisation a week ago.
An Italian military policeman, working with a civil law-enforcement group in
Mostar, died when his car skidded off the road in a rainstorm, amid floods that
threatened villages in the surrounding area.
Driving rain also jeopardised plans by US engineers to throw two pontoon
bridges across the Sava River dividing Croatia and Bosnia by this weekend.
The bridges are intended for the bulk of America's 20,000-strong force to reach
their Tuzla headquarters in the north.
To be assembled from parts by US army engineers, the pontoons hold the key link
in a corridor for arriving American troops from rear bases in Germany to
Bosnia.
``If these weather conditions persist, the river crossing can be potentially
delayed,'' said Major Jerry O'Hara, a spokesman for the Nato-led Implementation
Force (IFOR).
``We are looking at the river very closely,'' O'Hara told Reuters by telephone
from his Zagreb headquarters.
But alliance officials said plans to keep the warring factions apart and police
the hard-won peace were going ahead across the divided country, where a
60,000-strong world army is being assembled in an unprecedented show of Nato
strength.
The alliance summoned rival military commanders to Porebrice, northern Bosnia,
for their first regional peace talks in a bleak no-man's-land of bunkers and
minefields chosen by Nato to drive home the horror of the 3!s-year conflict.
Major General William Nash, head of US troops in Nato's Bosnia peace force,
convened the gathering so the warring parties' commanders could discuss
implementing peace by removing millions of mines strewn across the country.
They met in the remains of a shelled restaurant straddling snow-covered front
lines in north Bosnia where Muslims, Serbs and Croats fought some of the war's
fiercest battles.
The grim battlefield zone was meant ``to symbolise the horror of war and get on
with the peace,'' Nash's aide, Colonel Henry Strathman, told reporters. Spanish
troops and armour crossed into Serb-held areas of southern Bosnia for the first
time to assert Nato's ``go anywhere'' peace mandate.
In driving rain, a column of a dozen vehicles, including BMR armoured cars with
25mm cannon and 12.7mm machineguns, headed east from a checkpoint outside
Mostar towards the Bosnian Serb town of Nevesinje.
Under the peace accords rival military forces in the capital, Sarajevo, were
required to pull back from designated sites along the confrontation line they
fought over by midnight.
``It's going pretty well but the local commander is allowed to be a little
flexible and we'll wait until midnight to make a judgment,'' said a Nato
sources who asked not to be named.
A nominal deadline of 11am had been set, but local French commander General
Robert Rideau decided to extend it to provide more time for the withdrawal and
evaluation.
``I think that by tonight all our objectives will have been met,'' said Nato
spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Richard Pernod.
``What is significant is that at midnight all the very important places on the
frontline will be vacated,'' he added.
Many of the frontline positions selected for troop withdrawals were the scene
of bitter hand-to-hand fighting during the war over Serb secession from
Muslim-led Bosnia.
The centre of the historic southern Bosnian city of Mostar was threatened with
serious flooding, a French police officer said.
``The city centre could be entirely flooded if a dam just north of the city
were to burst,'' said gendarmerie Lieutenant-Colonel Jean-Pierre Fournet.
American forces have set up ``Checkpoint Assassin'' to control the way through
an eerily becalmed Bosnian war zone for 20,000 US troops joining the Nato-led
peace force.
Six US Bradley armoured battle vehicles with crew that include Gulf War
veterans train their guns on serene snowbound fields in the Posavina Corridor
where separatist Serbs fought Croat and Bosnian government forces on either
side of them for 43 months. -Reuter.

Petrol slump
MOTORISTS are buying less petrol than at any time in the past five years.
Figures show petrol sales slumped from 31.1 billion litres in 1990 to 29.4
billion last year. Sales rose in most other countries.
Watery grave
AN old fisherman has been buried with his TV remote control, tea and biscuits,
and the latest edition of Angling Times. ``We gave him the TV remote control
and the newspaper in case he wanted to catch up on the latest angling news,''
said 80-year-old Walter Davison's daughter Jillian, after the Lancashire

SO: Time to clear out the rubbish (surely ``droll vignettes and witty
apercus''?) from the locker before we hand in the poisoned pen and the chainsaw
(surely ``bardic quill and limner's sable''?) and join the rest of you in a
seasonal stupor (surely ``quiet contemplation of the turning year''?).
Time for the stuff we were never desperate enough to use on any other Thursday
morning. Time for jokes so old they predate Tory government, for stories so
shaggy you could enter them at Cruft's. Time, in other words, for the
Highlights of the Year.
JANUARY: Tories knocking lumps out of each other while the weather provokes the
usual exodus. With it, a crop of travellers' tales.
We hear, first, of the notice in a Belgrade hotel lift: ``To more the cabin,
push button for wishing floor. If the cabin should enter more persons, each one
should press a number of wishing floor. Driving is then going alphabetically by
national order.''
Not to be outdone, an Athens hotel instructed: ``Visitors are expected to
complain at the office between the hours of 9am and 11am daily'', while in
Bucharest a sign announced ``The flattening of underwear with pleasure is the
fob of the chambermaid.''
To which add the plea of a Norwegian lounge bar: ``Ladies are requested not to
have children in the bar''; and the boast of a Copenhagen airline office: ``We
take your bags and send them in all directions.''
Finally, a Japanese booklet concerning a hotel's air conditioning: ``Cooles and
Heates: If you want just condition of warm in your room, please control
yourself.''
FEBRUARY: Nothing ever happens in February.
MARCH: In like a lion, whatever that means. Where, come to that, are all those
cloots actually cast when May is ``oot''? A ``reader'' volunteers equally
penetrating queries which we come to think of as Questions That Need Answering.
Why isn't ``phonetic'' spelled the way it sounds? How, if nothing sticks to
Teflon, do they make Teflon stick to the pan? Why, if black boxes on aircraft
are indestructible, don't they make a whole plane out of the same stuff?
APRIL: With the economic outlook worsening and the Tories knocking lumps out of
each other, heart-rending tales emerge from the welfare system. Did we believe
these? Did we care? Thus (allegedly) from an Edinburgh benefit office came the
story of the woman writing to explain that ``I am forwarding a marriage
certificate and six children. I have seven, one died, which are baptised on a
half sheet of paper.''
Another went straight to the point: ``I cannot get sick pay. I have six
children. Can you tell me why?'' Amid all this there were the little human
tragedies: ``I am glad to report that my husband, who is missing, is dead'';
``This is my eighth child. What are you going to do about it?''; ``You have
changed my little boy to a girl. Will this make any difference?'' Our
favourite, though, was simplicity itself: ``I am forwarding my marriage
certificate and five children, one of which is a mistake as you can see.''
MAY: Cloots officially oot. This does not prevent Tories from knocking lumps
out of each other.
JUNE: Warm and dry. Resolve to write no more about Tories.
JULY: Nothing of note save Tories knocking etc: the silly season. Ditto the ad
from a Midlands freesheet: ``Lost: small apricot poodle. Reward. Neutered. Like
one of the family.''
This was matched by an advertisement spotted in California: ``Now is your
chance to have your ears pierced and get an extra pair to take home, too.''
For our own part, we recalled the attempt at English of a French farmer:
``Wanted: Unmarried girls to pick fresh fruit and produce at night.''
AUGUST: We hear of the Glasgow solicitor who dies and, inexplicably, winds up
in heaven. At the Pearly Gates he is dismayed to find thousands in the queue to
see Saint Peter.
To his surprise, the saint leaves the gate and comes to greet McGrabbit
personally. Then St Peter takes the solicitor by the hand and guides him to a
comfortable chair.
The lawyer says, ``I don't mind all this attention, but what makes me so
special?''
St Peter replies: ``Well, I've added up all the hours you billed your clients.
You must be 193 years old!''
SEPTEMBER: Holidays over, the Diary finds itself in receipt of fresh evidence
that English is indeed, if paradoxically, the international lingua franca. This
time it's menus, or as one inventive Chicago burger bar had it, ``me 'n'
yous''. From Cairo came ``Muscles Of Marines/Lobster Thermos''; ``Prawn cock
and tail''; and, taking the piece without much resistance, ``French-fried
ships''.
From Europe we heard of ``Garlic Coffee''; ``Sole Bonne Femme (Fish
Landlady-style)''; and ``Dreaded veal cutlet with potatoes in cream''. All this
rounded off with ``Sweat from the trolley''.
It was from the mystic east, nevertheless, that the best fine-food sightings
arrived. From Japan there was ``Strawberry crap'', the mouth-watering
``Buttered saucepans and fried hormones'', and delicious ``Teppan Yaki - Before
Your Cooked Right Eyes''.
We also heard tell of a Japanese mineral water called ``Kolic''; a Chinese
adhesive named ``Ass Glue''; an Austrian VCR known as a ``Hornyphon''; a Greek
soft drink called ``Zit''; a Ghanaian pepper sauce named ``Shitto''; and a
Spanish detergent called ``Colon Plus''.
OCTOBER: We are asked how many supermodels it takes to screw in a light bulb.
Answer: One. She just stands there, holding the bulb, and the whole world
revolves around her.
While waiting for the Tories to stop knocking lumps out of one another, we are
also asked how many Real Men it takes to change a bulb.
Answer: None. Real Men aren't afraid of the dark.
Then: how many thriller writers does it take to screw in a light bulb? Answer:
Two. One to screw it almost all the way in, and the other to give it a
surprising twist at the end.
NOVEMBER: Road safety campaigns begin, coinciding with the usual slew of
(probably) apocryphal tales from the insurance industry of statements made on
claims forms. Thus: ``Coming home I drove into the wrong house and collided
with a tree I don't have.''
``I thought my window was down, but I found it was up when I put my head
through it.''
``I pulled away from the side of the road, glanced at my mother-in-law and
headed over the embankment.''
``I told the police that I was not injured, but on removing my hat found that I
had a fractured skull.''
DECEMBER: On Christmas Day, according to the Associated Press, three men steal
the proceeds from a Belgrade branch of McDonald's. The burgers are left
untouched.
Meanwhile, a correction appears in the New Yorker. The note explains that one
William Bennett had criticised presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan's
politics as ``a real us-and-them kind of thing'' and not, as the magazine had
previously reported, ``a real S&amp;M kind of thing''.
Back home, the news is of the Shetland blizzards and their devastating effect
on power supplies. On ITN the bulletin concludes with the usual weather
forecast and the usual word from the usual, though not strictly applicable,
sponsor. Something about Powergen serving us ``whatever the weather''.
Thus the very last Question That Needs Answering: How does the man who drives
the snowplough get to his work?

A TOP adviser to Mr Major is leaving Downing Street early in the new year to
work for British Gas's controversial chief executive, Mr Cedric Brown.
Former diplomat Roderic Lyne, 43, who for the last three years has been one of
the Prime Minister's private secretaries, will work alongside the privatised
company's international team.
Mr Lyne, who played an important behind-the-scenes role in Northern Ireland
handling sensitive negotiations leading to the IRA ceasefire, will remain an
employee of the Foreign office and return there when his period of secondment,
six months to one year, is completed.
Whitehall sources stressed there was ``nothing significant'' in Mr Lyne's
departure.
But last night Labour MP John McFall, Shadow spokesman on Scottish Affairs,
including employment, said: ``Surely someone could have been found from outside
Government providing a job for someone more in need of it, especially at a time
when British Gas are still planning to shed thousands of jobs?''
A British Gas spokeswoman said: ``Secondments like this are routine as part of
the Government/industry exchange programme designed to broaden experience and
understanding of the way each works.''
Over the last year the public image of British Gas has taken a nosedive in a
series of public relations disasters.

<TEXT>
THE Government was last night facing new pressure over public pay with an
expected recommendation that 1.4 million workers should receive inflation-plus
rises.
The five independent review bodies, covering teachers, doctors and dentists,
nurses and allied professions, the armed forces, and judges and senior civil
servants, were reported to have recommended rises at or above the current 3.1%
inflation rate.
The recommended awards, due to be presented to the Cabinet in the new year,
will add to the pressure on Chancellor Kenneth Clarke who is determined to keep
a tight rein on public spending.
At the same time, they are unlikely to go far enough for the unions, with
teachers and health service representatives warning of deepening recruitment
difficulties unless they receive significant increases.
The teaching unions are today expected to submit their claim for a 4% rise amid
claims there could be a 30,000 teacher shortage by the end of the decade unless
action is taken.
Although Mr Clarke allocated an extra #774m to improve education in the Budget,
relaxing capping limits to enable local education authorities to fund it, a 4%
increase would absorb almost the entire rise.
The pressure for substantial rises is likely to be even more acute in the
health service where there are severe staff shortages in professions such as
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and psychology.

<TEXT>
SRI Lankan officials are considering asking for a meeting with Australian
umpire Darrell Hair as they try to salvage the Test career of off-spinner
Muttiah Muralidharan.
The 23-year-old bowler's future is in doubt after he was no-balled for throwing
on Tuesday during the Australian first innings in the second Test in Melbourne.
Anura Tennekoon, secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka,
said yesterday that it was essential to discover exactly what Hair finds
illegal about Muralidharan's style of delivery.
Tennekoon, a former Sri Lankan captain, said the team management were in the
process of reviewing the videotapes of Muralidharan in action during the overs
in which he was called for throwing.
``We want to find exactly from the umpire why some (deliveries) were called and
some weren't,'' he said.
Tuesday marked only the ninth occasion in Test history that a player has been
deemed to have illegally delivered a ball.
Muralidharan had not previously been no-balled for throwing in a 59-match
first-class career, but on Tuesday the highest wicket-taker in his country's
short Test history was no-balled seven times in the space of three overs.
On Wednesday, Muralidharan operated entirely from the Members' End under the
gaze of New Zealand umpire Steve Dunne, who did not no-ball him at any stage.
Umpire Hair was silent as he looked on from square leg.
Dunne's lack of action meant he ruled that Muralidharan bowled legitimately,
without straightening his arm while releasing the ball, although there was no
apparent change to his bowling action.
Muralidharan, who has taken 81 Test wickets, finished the day with unflattering
figures of one for 124 from 38 overs. But at least he bowled 20 overs without
censure on the second day.
But that was the only good news for the tourists, who suffered for a dismal
three sessions as Australia moved from their overnight 234 for three to declare
at 500 for six.
At close of play, Sri Lanka, trailing 1-0 in the three-Test series, were 29 for
one after losing Roshan Mahanama for three.

Lille
HOODED robbers attacked an armoured security van with a rocket launcher and
machineguns in northern France early today and killed one of its crew before
escaping with a large sum of cash, police said.
Two other Brink's employees were shot in the leg in the attack at about 1am in
Lesquin, about nine miles from the Belgian border. The exact amount stolen was
not disclosed.
Police said that more than 10 armed and masked men had taken part in the
attack, which appeared to have been carefully planned.
About 60 spent shells were found on the ground afterwards.
The armoured van had left Lille after collecting the day's receipts from
supermarkets when its way was blocked by two cars.
When the guards refused to leave the van, the thieves opened fire and blew up
the van's security door with a liquid explosive.
A 35-year-old guard, father of three children, died in the blast, police said.
Two other employees were in hospital in Lille.
The driver of a photo delivery van which had stopped behind the Brink's vehicle
said the thieves ordered him to get out and flee on foot.
``I ran, I heard several shots and I saw flames,'' he said. ``The robbers told
the guards to get out of the van. Hearing a refusal, they didn't hesitate and
fired point blank.''
The 10 men had used a roadblock to stop the armoured van near Lille airport.
After the three security guards in the Brink's van refused to flee, the
assailants - wearing hoods and black clothes - opened fire on the van with
assault rifles and used a rocket launcher to open the car's door, the delivery
van driver said. He fled into nearby bushes and witnessed the attack.
He said the heist lasted 15 minutes and the assailants calmly left in two cars.
``We're clearly dealing with a team of really professional bandits,'' said
Lille police commissioner Alain Epstein.
He said the assailants were ``determined, organised and without scruples.''
He said he did not know how much money had been stolen from the armoured van.
Police recovered about 70 shells from Kalashnikov assault rifles.
The armoured car was riddled with holes and its side door was blown out. Four
bags full of money were left behind.
Police were investigating the possibility that the attack was carried out by
the same gangsters who committed a similar heist in Belgium several days ago.
Five people, including two gendarmes and a child, were injured just outside
Brussels when thieves in two large trucks attempted to hold up two armoured
vans.
More than 50 armoured vehicles have been attacked in Belgium this year, many by
heavily-armed groups of about 10 men.-AP/Reuter.

Tokyo
AN American serviceman, described by his co-defendants as the ringleader in the
alleged rape of a schoolgirl, disputed today their claims that he bullied them
into an attack that has shaken United States-Japan relations.
In the sixth session of the trial of the three servicemen, Seaman Marcus Gill
implicated Marine privates Kendrick Ledet and Rodrico Harp in the rape of a
12-year-old schoolgirl on September 4, Kyodo news agency reported.
Ledet and Harp told Naha District Court they were forced by the older and
stronger Gill to help abduct the girl. Harp told the court he was afraid to
disobey Gill.
Gill, 23, has pleaded guilty to the September 4 abduction and rape of the
schoolgirl. Harp, 21, and Ledet, 20, say they joined in the abduction but did
not rape the girl.
Gill, who said that his two co-defendants ``left out the parts that made them
look bad'', told the court that Harp, who first spotted the girl, and Ledet
were the ones who jumped out of their rented car and grabbed her.
The case, which is continuing, has triggered an outpouring of resentment in
Okinawa at the concentration of United States military bases on the
island.-Reuter.

GLASGOW was today expected to wake up even colder after shivering its way
through the lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city.
Weathermen predicted that a new minimum of -18.7C recorded at Glasgow Airport
yesterday morning would drop further overnight, possibly to as low as -20C.
They said the Arctic conditions would continue for the rest of the week and
warned of more snow to come at the weekend, bringing with it a bleak and bitter
Hogmanay for party revellers.
The coldest place in Scotland on Tuesday night was at Altnaharra, Caithness,
where the temperature plummeted to -20.7C. It was followed closely by Tulloch
Bridge, near Fort William, at -20.5C.
The freeze continued in Grampian with a temperature of -20.1C in Braemar at 9am
yesterday, the coldest for 11 years.
In January 1985, the temperature in Braemar dropped to -23C and there is
speculation in the Deeside town that the British record of -27.2C, set in 1982,
might be challenged overnight.
The -18.7C recorded at Glasgow Airport warmed up to a high of -9.6C yesterday
afternoon. Edinburgh shivered in a high of -4.6C, and the coldest place in
Scotland at 2pm yesterday was at Loch Glascarnoch, Caithness, at -12C.
Mr Tom Keenan of the Glasgow Weather Centre said a combination of Arctic winds,
snow on the ground, clear skies at night and Glasgow's position in a valley
were all helping to produce the unusually low temperatures in the city.
Edinburgh's proximity to the Firth of Forth helped keep temperatures to a
relative high of -12C yesterday morning.
Mr Keenan said: ``For the past few days we have been getting winds coming right
down from the North Pole, so obviously they are very, very cold.
``They have then dropped off over central Scotland and there haven't been any
clouds at night, so the temperatures have dropped even lower.
``Glasgow also gets cold air seepage which spills down off the hills.
``The temperature is getting off to a very low start. It dropped 13 degrees on
Tuesday night, so if it goes the same way again it will be heading towards -20C
overnight.
``It becomes progressively colder each night. It's going to last for the rest
of the week with things taking a turn for the worse during the weekend.
``We are expecting a fair bit of snow to come up from the south-west. The
timing is a bit up in the air, but at the moment we think it will be in the
second half of Saturday or the first half of Sunday. There will be significant
snowfalls in central Scotland and it will be fairly disruptive as well.
``There is an increasing risk of getting some freezing fog because the air is
becoming very stagnant, it's picking up smoke and pollution which all helps fog
to form. Once it fogs out, the temperature can't fall any lower.''
He said a thaw could come at the start of next week, but added: ``Our
confidence isn't particularly high on that scenario at the moment.''
Social services chiefs in Strathclyde have appealed for people to check on
elderly neighbours struggling to keep warm in the arctic temperatures.
Two OAPs were taken into care yesterday because of burst pipes in their homes
and Scottish Gas engineers struggled to clear a huge backlog of calls for help
from people left without heating or hot water.
A spokeswoman for Strathclyde Regional Council's social work department said:
``People seem to have been coping remarkably well, but how long that can go on
is another matter.''
She said many elderly people were worried about their water pipes bursting
because of the weather.

IN 1996 I would like to record, with full orchestral backing, the world's 20
worst songs. An inspiration prompted by your response to my strong views of
what might loosely be called a song, I Believe, which does for believing what
John Wayne did for acting.
Real stinkeroo songs are so bad they become good in a perverse sort of way.
Take Nobody's Child. It plumbed the depths of bad taste and then went further.
A blind orphan with no mother's kisses is an image which would normally reduce
me to tears, but I kept thinking of hard-bitten writers cynically wringing out
the pathos. ``Let's make her blind. That will really have them bubbling in the
streets of Govan tonight.'' And it did, yes it did, in spades, with knobs on.
Hollywood, when making The Jazz Singer, sent for some of Tin Pan Alley's best
songwriters. Al Jolson, a monster according to those who knew him, whose mania
for himself was boundless, demanded a show-stopping song. Buddy De Sylva, Lew
Brown, and Ray Henderson were credited, if that's the right word, for what they
considered, and meant to be, the biggest ever load of songwriting manure the
world had ever seen or heard. A monstrous song for a monster, Sonny Boy.
Jolson loved it, so did the public, thus giving birth to the still prevailing
wisdom of tabloid thinking: ``You can't lose by underestimating the taste of
Joe Public.'' Talking movies were off to a low-flying start and have plunged to
the depths ever since.
But wait a minute. Think of the fun we've had with Sonny Boy. The many
parodies. ``Climb upon my knee sonny boy, though you're six foot three, sonny
boy. There's no way of knowing, just how fast you're growing, or what you mean
to me, sonny boy.''
I remember being taken to the Glasgow Empire by my Dad when but a child. Top of
the bill was Izzy Bonn, who revelled in schmaltz. My Yiddish Mamma was his
theme song. He would come to the front of the stage and belt it out, right to
the gods. Unashamedly trawling for emotional responses.
It was during or just prior to the festive season. He sang a song which went
roughly as follows: ``He's the little boy who Santa Claus forgot, and goodness
knows he didn't want a lot. He sent a note to Santa for some soldiers and a
gun. It broke his little heart when he found Santa hadn't come. In the streets
he envied all those lucky boys, and wandered home to last year's broken toys.
I'm so sorry for that laddie, for he hasn't got a daddy. He's the little boy
that Santa Claus forgot.'' All around adults were howling, and not wanting to
be left out of this mass outpouring of grief, I started howling as well.
I have never forgotten, when still just a child, Tommy Morgan throwing down the
gauntlet to the leader of the Third Reich, at the height of the last war, from
the stage of the Glasgow Pavilion. ``There'll always be a Rothesay at the Ferr.
There'll always be a Rothesay at the Ferr. Hitler thinks he's very, very cute,
but he'll never spend his holidays on the dear old Kyles of Bute. He'll sink a
few more sma' boats I suppose, but he'll never sink the Duchess of Montrose. He
may bomb and bomb and bomb us, but we'll never turn a hair, for there'll always
be a Rothesay at the Ferr.''
Nor will I forget Sammy Murray in the Queen's Theatre singing ``Orra King's
horses, Orra King's men, Marching up the Gallowgate, and marching back again,
orra King's horses and orra King's men.''
Our very own, multi-talented, eternally effervescent Cliff Hanley could write a
bad song or two, very deliberately, and I'm not thinking of Scotland the Brave.
I have an LP of Fran and Anna singing a song written by Cliff entitled Voulez
Vous Ra Noo. Lorenz Hart would have proudly laid claim to the lyric. And Fran
and Anna, Scotland's answer to the Andrews Sisters, did it justice.
Jack Short, Jimmy Logan's dad, dabbled in song writing. During the shooting of
the movie Rockets Galore, the crew and stars were based on the island of Barra.
Half of Scottish Equity seemed employed on the project. Some of the old acting
hands, as was their wont, did severe damage each night to the whisky stocks in
the hotel's residents' bar. Except Jim's dad.
One morning at breakfast he looked round his fellow thespians, whose heads were
down, eyeing suspiciously the fried eggs on their plates, and said something
like this: ``While you lot were belting the bevvy last night I was getting tore
intae writing a song,'' which he then sang. It was called Effie O'Hara fae
Barra. I would dearly love to get my hands on that song. It seems a prime
candidate for my LP.
But what about, ``A you're adorable, B you're so byootiful, C you're a cutieful
of charm.'' Come on admit it. It's trite, trivial, and altogether tremendous.
And there's, ``If you walk through a storm keep you're head up high, and don't
be afraid of the dark.'' I tried it one night, and nearly broke my neck. Songs
like that should come with a health warning.
Tom Jones had some really rotten songs, like Delilah and, It's Not Unusual, To
Be Loved By Someone Else. Which begs the question, who else can love you, if
not someone else?
You can have some fun with good songs. There is a vandal in Glasgow by the name
of Lex Kelly who re-writes Sinatra standards in Glasgowese. One of his lines
was, ``And tell me whit street, compares wi' Pitt Street''. This got me going
and I penned, ``I get no kick from champagne, wood alcohol never thrills me at
all, won't you tell me just how it can be, that I get a kick from VP?''
But when it's good songs you're mucking about with you feel guilty. It's kind
of sacrilegious. Deliberately mocking rotten songs is counterproductive. You
cannot make them any worse.
The best way to bring out their inner meaninglessness is to sing them straight,
particularly if you have a rotten voice. The mawkishness can then become
magical. You don't believe me? Just listen to me singing A You're Adorable in
5/4 time. A one, a two, a three, four, five. ``A you're `effin' adorable, B
you're so effin' byootiful . . .'' Convinced? Happy New Year to you all.

IT was a winter wonderland yesterday for thousands of skiers and snow-boarders
enjoying Alpine conditions on Scotland's slopes.
Temperatures at the five winter sports centres remained well below zero all
day, with clear blue skies and calm winds.
Access to all the resorts presented no problems other than drivers having to
take extra care on the icy roads.
But some of the centres still remain a bit short of snow and the White Corries
Centre in Glencoe has yet to open for the season.
More than one thousand people flocked to the Cairngorm slopes, near Aviemore,
where seven lifts out of 17 were in operation.
Ms Tania Adams, of the Cairngorm Chairlift Company, said: ``Overhead conditions
here are perfect. There is hardly any wind and the sun shone throughout the
day. Our snow-cover is still a bit lighter than we would like, but the pisting
machines have been in action giving us some good complete runs.''
At the Lecht Ski Centre all but one of the 12 lifts were working.
Temperatures there did not rise above -8C but blue skies and sunshine were
enjoyed by the 900 skiers.
At Glenshee the chairlift company had three upper lifts and six lower ones
working at Cairnwell, near Braemar.
Some of the Glenshee runs were complete with packed snow. But cover is thin on
others and limited nursery areas were available.
Temperatures there peaked at -9C, and around 2000 people were out on the slopes.
Around 1000 people were on the slopes at Scotland's newest winter sports
centre, Nevis Range, on the 4006ft Aonach Mor, near Fort William.
The resort, which underwent a #750,000 expansion in the close season, is still
a bit short of snow.
There was ample snow on the nursery slopes, but the slopes available for
intermediate-level skiers were ``a bit limited'' said Nevis Range spokeswoman
Cally Fleming.
But there was still no action at the White Corries Centre at Glencoe, which
needs a heavy snowfall to fill in the big gullies.
Mr Ian Symons, of Castle Douglas-based Weather Watchers, says there is a good
chance of fresh heavy snowfalls on the slopes tomorrow. The cold snap is
expected to last at least until Hogmanay.
Meanwhile, insurers are warning skiers who suffer injury on the slopes abroad
that they could face soaring hospital bills.
The cost of treating ski injuries at top winter sports destinations is climbing
rapidly, said one travel insurance company.
Worst places to have a spill in the snow are Switzerland and America, while the
most frequent types of ski injuries are to the soft tissues of the lower limbs.
``The cost of medical care in ski resorts is racing away, leaving behind a lot
of skiers who are seriously out of pocket,'' said Ms Sarah Joannides, marketing
manager for the insurance company, Home and Overseas.

SPEEDWAY:
ALEX Harkess was born an optimist and it is this quality that is being tested
to the full as he fights to keep speedway alive in Edinburgh.
Monarchs' co-promoter makes car number plates by day, and by night attempts to
figure out how to work a miracle. For the axe hangs over their traditional home
at Powderhall Stadium, which once used to ring to the cheers of up to 11,000
fans as the kings of two-stroke careered around the shale track at speeds of up
to 60mph.
Those heady days are long gone. Last season, crowds averaged around 1200 for
Friday race nights and the English-based businessmen who now own the 10-acre
site want to turn it into housing and offices.
Monarchs entertained arch Scottish rivals Glasgow Tigers in a Premier League
derby - billed as the Farewell to Powderhall meeting - last October and the
famous Edinburgh club are set to become homeless after 19 years at the track.
If the lights go out it could bring the curtain down on a capital sporting
tradition which stretches back to 1928.
But so many objections have been received to the plans that the issue will not
now come up before Edinburgh District Council planners until next month - a
delay forced by the weight of public opinion and paperwork, and a delay which
increases the anxiety of the club's chiefs.
Naturally, Harkess is delighted that more than 1000 objections have been backed
by a 10,000 signature petition but the extension has caught him between the
rock and the hard place. For he has been forced to kick-start team-building so
as not to be left at the tapes if Monarchs are allowed another year at
Powderhall, or talks for a new site on the capital's outer-city by-pass bear
fruit.
Last night Harkess revealed: ``We couldn't wait any longer to start talking to
riders. If we had, they could be gone and we would have been left with nothing.
``Certainly, the weight of public opinion is a boost but it's a double-edged
sword. We won't know what's happening until mid-January and we'll have to get
things sorted out, otherwise we won't have a team to race with.
``It's a difficult situation but you've got to look positively at things and
the solicitors for the new owners say that if there is a planning delay then
they'll look at speedway at Powderhall for another season.''
Harkess, who has been involved with the shale sport for more years than he
cares to remember, said: ``Sure, it will be a major blow if we go to all the
trouble of fixing a team and find we have nowhere to race but we can't sit
around waiting. We've got to get out and do something.
``Everybody connected to the club is pleased that so many people have come out
and supported the Hands Off Powderhall move. Some of these people are greyhound
racing fans, but many also support speedway.''
Edinburgh's speedway heritage goes back almost 70 years. Portobello's Marine
Gardens housed the first meeting. Now, it's a garage and diesel fumes from the
city's bus fleet filter forth instead of the intoxicating two-stroke mixture.
Never-say-die speedway fans uprooted in 1948 to Meadowbank, where around 25,000
people crammed the terracings as Britain got back to normal after the Second
World War.
Meadowbank still houses sport but now it's the human variety rather than
mechanical version which rules at the Commonwealth Stadium, the home of the
1970 and 1986 Comonwealth Games.
Powderhall revved up for its first meeting in 1977 and the arena, once also
Scotland's No.1 greyhound racing venue, has been its permanent home ever since,
even staging the wedding of one of its former favourite sons one rainswept
night.
Last night, the defiant Monarchs' chairman refused to admit defeat and said:
``We will not allow the club to die. One option is at the Royal Highland
Showground at Ingliston on the western outskirts of Edinburgh and, to be fair
to them, they've always said that they could not accomodate us until 1997, when
they will have completed their new showground.
``Another is a new site on the city boundary near the by-pass but I can't say
any more about that at the moment.''
Ironically, the curtain could come down as Monarchs are riding high in the top
10 of the Premier League, their highest standing in British speedway for years.
Monarchs are unbeaten at home in the country's elite league from early May, and
their results on the road last season exceeded expectations.
The pulse still beats strongly even though they might be running out of road
and Harkess said: ``Our crowds might average around 1200 but thousands more are
still interested in speedway, and preserving it as a spectator sport in the
city. We're not buried yet, not by a long way.''

A SALE-happy sheik bought a store's entire contents for #350,000 yesterday to
please his third wife. Everything from furnishings shop Charlotte's at London's
Marble Arch - including the wallpaper - will now be shipped to Dubai in the
Arab Emirates.
The sheik, a member of the Qatar ruling family, will use his purchases to
recreate the store in his own shopping     centre. Mr Martin Barnett, owner of
the soft furnishings and embroidery centre, said: ``The sheik came in with his
entourage after seeing the sale signs up. He thought the shop was for sale but
I told him it wasn't. He bought nine sofas and then asked me how much for the
whole lot.
``Apparently, his third wife had been in during the summer and he said she
liked the concept. He owns the equivalent of Brent Cross from what I can make
out. He gave me some cash and later I received a fax from his bank and a cheque
for the remainder of the deposit.
``There was a crowd of people waiting for my sale to start and everyone was
astonished. Now I will have to find new stock.''
Mr Barnett said the Arab, who lives in Dubai, had asked for his identity to be
kept secret.

THE Princess of Wales and a female companion were on their way from ice-bound
Britain to the Caribbean last night as her two sons continued to spend the
Christmas break with their father.
Her departure has ended speculation over whether she would choose a skiing or
beach holiday to follow her home-alone Christmas at Kensington Palace.
The British West Indian Airways International plane was heading for Antigua in
the Leeward Islands. There was no confirmation of which island the princess had
chosen, but speculation centred on Nevis, a small island a 20-minute plane ride
from Antigua.
The princess visited Nevis three years ago, within weeks of the announcement of
her official separation from Prince Charles.
On that occasion she was with Princes William and Harry but this time she
decided to leave them with their father for both Christmas and New Year.
Under the terms of agreement between the prince and princess in the wake of
their separation, the boys share their holidays between their parents.
It was the princess's turn to have the boys for Christmas this year but she
announced that she wanted them to join in the traditional royal family
Christmas at Sandringham in Norfolk. At first she said she would be there too,
but later changed her mind.
She is reported to have had a cold Christmas lunch, left for her by staff who
had been given the holiday off.
On Boxing Day, Diana spent more than an hour visiting her bulimia therapist, Ms
Susie Orbach, according to the Sun and the Daily Mirror.
Both had pictures of her smiling as she left the 49-year-old feminist writer,
who had counselled her about her problems with the eating disorder several
years ago.
Diana was also reported to have visited the clinic, at Ms Orbach's home in
north-west London, on Christmas Eve.
Meanwhile, Princes William and Harry spent yesterday pheasant shooting with
their father, and their grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh.
At the weekend they are due to leave Britain with their father, bound for his
favourite ski resort, Klosters.
Yesterday a palace official said she had no information about the princess's
Caribbean trip.
``All holiday arrangements are private and they are not something we give any
guidance on,'' she said.

Buenos Aires
TEN high-spirited judges, including one investigating the bombing of a Jewish
centre in 1994, were fined today over a wild Christmas party held at a
courthouse, an Argentine court tribunal president said.
Juan Jose Galeano was one of 10 federal judges fined one third of their monthly
salary for conduct inappropriate to the rank of magistrate, Judge Horacio Raul
Vigliani told Reuters.
``(This is) the maximum penalty the tribunal can apply,'' Vigliani said.
Galeano is famous in Argentina for leading the investigation into a
still-unresolved bomb attack against the Buenos Aires Amia Jewish community
centre, which killed 86 people in July 1994.
Another high-profile judge, Adolfo Bagnasco, who is investigating alleged
corruption over a $250m contract awarded by the state-owned Banco Nacion to
computer firm IBM, was also among those fined, Vigliani said.
More than 100 judges and court workers attended the party last Friday in a
Buenos Aires courthouse where revels included squirting fire extinguishers,
local media reported.
Complaints were made about loud music and howling sounds coming from the
courthouse. Legal employees fled down staircases when another judge,
accompanied by police, tried to restore decorum.
The judge was sworn at and one of his colleagues tried to punch him, according
to local media reports.
The tribunal said the judges had given ``laconic'' and ``evasive'' replies to
questioning over the incident.-Reuter.

THE freezing weather yesterday claimed five lives, including two children and
two teenagers. An Ayrshire boy died from hypothermia, a teenage girl was killed
in a car crash in Renfrewshire, and doctors lost a battle to resuscitate a man
who had been trapped for 30 minutes under ice in a lake.
John Colquhoun, 16, of Barbieston Avenue, Drongan, and a friend had abandoned a
car which had left the road at 3am on Christmas Day.
John set off in shirt sleeves on his own to walk the four miles home, but
travelled only half the distance. His friend, who had been driving, had set off
in another direction.
The Colquhoun family contacted the police after hearing a radio report about
the discovery of a body.
John's sister Mandy, 19, said last night: ``On Christmas Day dad was preparing
Christmas dinner. We got worried when John wasn't home by noon.
``Then we heard on the radio that a body had been found near Mauchline. It all
happened very quickly after that.''
Miss Michelle Anderson, 18, of Burnside Road, Elderslie, died and a 19-year-old
youth was seriously injured yesterday when their car hit a lamppost on the
Johnstone bypass, near the St James interchange, Paisley.
Driver John Watson, of Willow Avenue, Elderslie, was taken to Glasgow's
Southern General Hospital where he was described as ``critical''.
Two children died and their three brothers and sisters were injured when a
lorry collided with their stationary car on a dual carriageway near Easington,
County Durham.
The youngsters who died were Oliver Stephen Docx, 15, and four-year-old
Alexandra. Hannah, 10, was seriously injured; Samuel, 17, suffered bruising;
and Stephen, 13, a leg injury. Their parents, Stephen, 43, and Joanna, 42, of
Heaton, Newcastle upon Tyne, were treated for severe shock.
Shetland's Coastguard helicopter took five patients for emergency treatment.
A nine-year-old boy had suffered convulsions. He was picked up from his home at
Dunrossness and taken to Clickimin emergency landing strip, Lerwick, at 9pm
where an ambulance was waiting to take him to hospital.
The helicopter then went to Sumburgh airport to take four seriously ill
patients from Gilbert Bain Hospital to Aberdeen. The mission was the twelfth
for the Bristows-operated Shetland helicopter in two days.
A major police hunt involving a helicopter and police dogs was under way last
night for a man seen wandering wearing little more than pyjamas in East
Kilbride.
Police Inspector Caroline Scott said: ``Our concern is growing as time goes by.
Anyone spending the night in the open in such clothing may well be dead by
morning because of the extreme cold.''
The man wearing striped pyjamas and either a sweater or dressing gown was first
seen at lunchtime leaving the grounds of Hairmyres Hospital.
Although a check with the hospital revealed no patients were missing, he was
later spotted by two motorists crossing the town's Eaglesham Road, heading
towards the local railway station.
Police, who had received no missing person report, were about to call off the
search as darkness fell but the man was spotted again in Peel Park, half a mile
from the hospital. Policemen with dogs combed the area, but found no sign of
him.
They appealed to local taxi firms, bus companies, ScotRail and local publicans
to keep a lookout for the man and urged members of the public to check on
vulnerable relatives.
A medical team last night lost a fight to bring back from the dead a man who
dived into an ice-covered lake to save his dog.
Mr Robert Giles, 25, of Andover, Hampshire, was officially pronounced dead
after being trapped under the surface for more than 30 minutes before rescuers
pulled him to safety.
Then doctors realised his body temperature had plunged to just 18 degrees -
less than half the normal human temperature - slowing his heart and other
organs. This drastically reduced oxygen requirements, meaning there was a
chance Mr Giles could be revived.
The medical team immediately went into action again, and at first thought they
had saved Mr Giles, but his condition deteriorated and he died.
The incident took place at

Anton Lake in King Arthur's Way, where Mr Giles and his West Highland Terrier
were out for a run.
Inspector David Waller, spokesman for Andover police, paid tribute to the
bravery of a member of the local coastguard rescue team and Detective Constable
Tony Hewitt, a diving enthusiast, who rescued Mr Giles from the lake.
Mr Giles had thrown a stick for his dog which ran on to the two-inch thick ice
to retrieve it. The dog slipped beneath the surface as the ice cracked.
``The dog owner ventured on to the ice to try to rescue his pet but fell in and
disappeared beneath the frozen water,'' said Mr Waller. ``He was seen to
disappear by a member of the public who raised the alarm and a call for help
went out.''
Firefighters arrived but did not have the equipment to wade out into the water.
Mr Hewitt, a member of Andover sub-aqua team, heard the radio call and ran home
to get some equipment.
Mr Waller explained how the diver and a coastguard found the man on the bottom
of the lake.
``The man was not breathing and appeared to be dead,'' he added. ``He had been
under the water for the best part of 30 minutes. Ambulancemen gave him
resuscitation and he was then airlifted from the banks of the lake to
hospital.''
The dog managed to scramble out of the water to safety.
Doctors in the intensive care unit at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in
Winchester battled to revive Mr Giles. A hospital spokesman said: ``Because of
the man's body temperature we believed there was a chance we would be able to
revive him and therefore continued to resuscitate him for some time.''
Residents living near the lake said two other dog walkers had drowned there in
recent years.
The man who fell through ice at Threipmuir Reservoir, Balnerno, on Christmas
Eve was last night said to be ``critical but stable''.
Mr Fraser Millar, 29, of Bughtlin Park, Corstorphine, Edinburgh, was detained
in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. He had been trapped for an hour in the reservoir
after ice gave way under him as he was trying to rescue his dog.
Two Hydro-Electric linesmen managed to restore power to the island of Bressay
after struggling through deep drifts. After the supply was reconnected to the
remaining five houses, which had been blacked out for 79 hours, they had to
back their van for two miles on snow-packed roads.
Last night the P &amp; O cargo ferry diverted from a planned shipyard visit for her
annual refit and sailed from Aberdeen to Shetland with supplies of gas
cannisters.
Staff from the island Calor gas depot, on a hill outside Lerwick, were flown by
helicopter from their snowbound homes on the west side of Shetland.
British Gas engineers also struggled to cope with a huge backlog of calls all
over the country from people left without heating or hot water after their
central heating systems broke down.
The transport system throughout Scotland was in chaos. Rail passengers in the
central belt faced long delays after trains froze to tracks in depots and
others suffered mechanical breakdowns caused by ice and freezing pipes.
Scottish Office Minister George Kynoch said the Government was monitoring the
situation in Shetland closely and was ready to call in the military if
necessary. However, he had been told by Shetland Islands Council that the
situation was under control.
RAC members asking for help at home faced delays of up to 11 hours, while AA
Home Start members were kept waiting for up to four hours. Both organisations
called in all available staff to take telephone calls and attend roadside
breakdowns, which were treated as priorities.
The AA had 150 outstanding calls in Glasgow yesterday morning from people who
had called the night before. Taxis were despatched by both organisations to
take people to work or home, but anyone whose car would not start was advised
to sit tight at home if possible.
The RAC said it had received 5000 calls yesterday, up 250%.
Frozen rolling stock prompted Railtrack and ScotRail to reduce most train
services in Strathclyde to hourly departures. ScotRail staff were last night
working on an emergency cold weather timetable for today.
There were severe delays in the Aberdeen area after two trains blocked the main
line into the city from the south. Commuters and shoppers going home from
Glasgow faced delays of two to three hours on most routes last night.
The Glasgow to Edinburgh route was today due to be continued on an hourly basis
instead of half-hourly, with trains leaving Glasgow on the hour.
ScotRail has opened a recorded information line on 0141 226 4023.
ScottishPower reported a 25% increase in demand for electricity yesterday.

LABOUR deputy leader John Prescott yesterday reminded 16 Tory MPs - rumoured to
be thinking of joining the ``chicken run'' to safer seats - of the loyalty they
owed to their constituents.
He warned voters in the 16 seats to be on ``chicken alert'' - to watch whether
their sitting Tory MP deserted them as the General Election drew near.
Mr Prescott challenged the 16 Tories, including Scottish Secretary Ian Lang,
Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley, and Transport Minister John Watts, to
give an undertaking they would stand as the Tory candidate in the seats for
which they were elected.
Ten Tories have already switched to safer seats, including Tory party chairman
Dr Brian Mawhinney and Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell.
Some of the 16, and the 10 who have already switched, are doing or have done so
because their seats are subject to boundary changes.
So far 50 Tory MPs have announced they will either retire or leave the Commons
at the next election.
Mr Prescott said: ``Voters prefer loyal and long-standing MPs and that
incumbency factor is worth thousands of votes. It means the new Tory candidates
in those seats will have an even harder time holding them.
``These chicken-run Tories are giving John Major a double helping of stuffing -
admitting they expect to lose the seats and making it even more likely in the
process.''

A SIXTEEN-year-old Ayrshire youth died from hypothermia on Christmas Day after
abandoning a car and trying to walk four miles home early in the morning.
John Colquhoun, of Barbieston Avenue, Drongan, was a fit and healthy young man
and a keen footballer who had won a number of trophies and trained with Ayr
United. There was talk of him joining Rangers Boys' Club, the family said.
His family said last night they were shocked and devastated by the tragedy.
John had been out with friends at a Christmas Eve disco. He and another friend
visited friends after the party and eventually headed home via Mauchline. But
at 3am their car slipped off the road in the icy conditions and ended up in a
ditch.
The two friends decided to walk different routes home. John, who was said to
have been wearing just a shirt, walked two of the four miles to his house
before stopping. He had been drinking and it is thought he might have stopped
to rest and fallen asleep.
His family became more worried about him on Christmas Day. They contacted
police after hearing a radio report about a body being found near their home.
His sister Mandy, 19, a VDU operator in Ayr, said last night: ``My mum is very
upset and we are all shocked.
``On Christmas Day dad was preparing Christmas dinner. We got worried when John
wasn't home by noon. Then we heard on the radio that a body had been found near
Mauchline. It all happened very quickly after that.
``John had been hyper about going out on Christmas Eve. He was 16 and this was
his first real Christmas out.''
Mandy said John had been drinking and that he had maybe fallen asleep after
taking a rest at the roadside. She said: ``The cold has just got him.''
John, who had started working as an apprentice roofer in Drongan four weeks
ago, had two other teenage sisters, Lorna and Tracy, and a 22-year-old brother,
Robert.
His mother Elizabeth, 39, and father John, 41, both unemployed, were distraught
last night.
Friend Kirsty Broadfoot, 19, said: ``He was a good fun-loving person who always
enjoyed a laugh. He had a lot of friends in the village. Everyone knew his
face.''
Kirsty, sister of John's girlfriend Kim, said the two had been going out
together for a year and had known each other since primary school.
The Broadfoots were fellow schoolmates of John at Auchinleck Academy.
A post-mortem examination was held yesterday and his father also identified the
body.
Strathclyde Police said the public should take suitable precautions against the
cold.
They said John had been taken to Ayr Hospital where he was found to be dead.
There are no suspicious circumstances and a report has been submitted to the
procurator-fiscal.
The funeral is due to be held at Shaw Kirk on Saturday.

A SHETLAND lifeboat was pressed into service yesterday to carry coal, milk and
bottled gas to snowbound villages.
The lifeboat Snolda, based at Aith on the west coast of the islands, was making
a 140-mile return trip to Lerwick.
Lifeboat secretary Alan Norris said coxswain Hilton Henry and his five-man crew
were calling at the isolated villages of Walls, Brindister and West Burrafirth
on the return journey last night.
Three families in Brindister had run out of food and were to collect emergency
rations from the lifeboat. Bottled gas was urgently needed for the old people's
sheltered housing in Walls and Aith, which had been cut off from the rest of
Shetland since Christmas Eve.
The lifeboat is due to visit Clousta and the island of Papa Stour today with
supplies.
The day dawned sunny and calm over much of Shetland - ideal weather for a three
helicopters to fly Hydro-Electric engineers and replacement power poles to
isolated areas.
Power was restored to all but 375 houses.
Three people were airlifted to the Gilbert Bain Hospital in Lerwick with
suspected hypothermia, although one case was a false alarm.
All main roads were passable, but only by four-wheel drive vehicles and the
ferries were managing to run a skeleton service.
All scheduled flights to and from the islands remained cancelled.
Meanwhile, more than 150 British Airways passengers were given an unexpected
sail yesterday after snow and ice closed Stornoway airport on Lewis.
The airline chartered Caledonian Macbrayne's newest ferry, the Isle of Lewis,
to make an extra sailing from Stornoway to Ullapool where a fleet of buses had
been laid on to take the passengers to Inverness or Glasgow.
The passengers included Western Isles MP Calum Macdonald and his colleague from
Cunninghame North, Mr Brian Wilson.
In the Western Isles all main roads were open but there were 90 engineers
working trying to restore power to 584 customers.
The 220 customers on the island of Berneray were reconnected in the middle of
the afternoon. The major remaining fault was at Uig on the west of Lewis but it
was hoped to have it repaired last night.

GLASGOW'S City Watch closed-circuit television cameras, credited with cutting
crime and making the city centre safer, could face a financial crisis in the
spring.
Of the estimated 2000 businesses covered by the cameras only 250 have forked
out to help with the system's running costs of around #250,000 a year. Among
the non-payers are some of Britain's biggest high street names and several of
Glasgow's flagship companies.
The initial cost of City Watch was #1.1m, including CCTVS, fibre-optic ducting,
monitoring equipment at Stewart Street Police Station, and employment of 14
observers. Funding runs out in March, leaving City Watch, the charity which
owns and runs the system, facing possible closure unless the local authorities
come to the rescue.
Negotiations are in progress with the new Glasgow Council, Glasgow Development
Agency and others to secure the system's future. City Watch is also approaching
Strathclyde Police and the procurator-fiscal's department to raise funds.
Glasgow's CCTV system has won widespread acclaim, despite question marks over
whether such systems cut crime or merely displace it.
The Home Office, its Local Government Information Unit, and the Scottish Office
have all praised the system. Glasgow's code of conduct, designed to meet civil
liberties' misgivings, is set to form the basis of a national code for the UK.
Retiring Chief Constable Leslie Sharp of Strathclyde Police, who created the
code of practice, has been enthusiastic about the Glasgow system, emphasising
how it has allowed his officers to observe incidents as they happen.
He is convinced it has made the city centre safer for everyone.
Councillor Pat Lally, leader of Glasgow District Council's Labour
administration and planning convener of the new Glasgow Council, yesterday
agreed with The Herald that it might finally fall to the new council to pick up
the tab for the CCTV system.
``I am afraid that these things always seem to end up with us. It is a fact of
life. We all extol the fruits of partnership but there are times when I despair
of the commitment of commercial community, particularly in the city centre and
particularly for matters such as this,'' he said.
In the last two years the district council had offered additional resources to
promote the city centre at Christmas provided the business community also
responded. But, said Councillor Lally, members of the business community had
not taken up the offer.
``There seems to be a tendency to regard partnership as a good idea as long as
they do not have to contribute,'' said Councillor Lally, ``but it does not work
that way.''
It was not a foregone conclusion, he added, that the new Glasgow Council would
pay to keep the system running.
``We are entering a period when local government is being squeezed by central
government. Resources are going to be very thin on the ground. Apart from the
public at large the major beneficiaries are the business community so it is
regrettable that some of them regard the cameras as a present from Santa
Claus,'' he said.
The new city council faced the possibility of compulsory redundancies among
staff, meaning that the Glasgow CCTV system might be regarded as a luxury.
``CCTV is an additional burden which may be placed on us and we are not sure
that we will be able to carry it. At present we are simply unable to commit
ourselves but it would be a tragedy if the cameras were lost,'' Councillor
Lally said.
City Watch manager David McKay said yesterday that it had made intensive
efforts to persuade business to contribute.
``Some have given very well but many of the major companies say to us that they
are not empowered to contribute, that it is a decision for their head offices
in London. When we ask them they say it is a policy matter not to contribute
because if they gave to Glasgow they would have to give to every city-centre
scheme in Britain where they have outlets.
``But we have reached an important point where it has to be acknowledged that
these schemes are going to increase tenfold. Everyone is going to be looking to
the local authorities and asking them to fund the running costs. We have had a
12% response from Argyle Street, which is more or less typical of the city
centre as a whole.
``Yet in Aberdeen the traders alone have contributed #240,000 to start a
scheme. Glasgow is being parsimonious at a time when phenomenal sums are being
made in retail turnover in the city centre,'' Mr McKay said.
Mr Bill Neish, general manager of Marks and Spencer, which has contributed
substantially, said that one excuse offered by others was that their heavy
business rates should help provide a safe ambience in the city centre,
including the cameras.
``Perhaps it is time to include a security element in the business rates
collected by the city and to ring-fence that element for cameras,'' he said.

Jim Waugh, writer, broadcaster, jazz expert; born October 26, 1941, died
December 25, 1995
JIM WAUGH, who died           suddenly on Christmas morning at the age of 54,
would have appreciated the irony of sharing his date of death with the late
Dean Martin, with whom he also shared a love of music, wine and the good things
of life.
Born in Glasgow in 1941, son of William and Helen Waugh, he was brought up and
educated in the South Side of the city where his father worked as an electrical
engineer for the city council.
Waugh's early career was in civil engineering, a fact which surprised many who
knew him later in life, more so as he was responsible for a number of very
large civil engineering projects both in the UK and in the Middle East.
Although his prospects as an engineer were good, he became disaffected and his
lifelong passion for art, literature and music (indicated in his co-founding of
Platform Jazz in the sixties) drew him in other directions.
As a mature student Waugh undertook a joint honours degree at Glasgow
University in art, history, and English literature, graduating in the mid-70s.
Thereafter his talents as a journalist and broadcaster came to the fore and he
worked for The Herald, The Scotsman Colour Magazine, the late Sunday Standard
and the Sunday Times. He also made a substantial mark as a jazz broadcaster.
At Radio Clyde, working with the handle ``Nighthawk'', his immense knowledge of
the international jazz scene, its personalities and the complexity and
diversity of its music gave the West of Scotland over a decade of inspired,
amusing and highly informed late-night broadcasting.
Waugh's interviews with luminaries from both the international music scene and
from cinema were conducted with deft expertise, humility and his characteristic
gentle good humour. This invariably put interviewees at their ease and drew out
a great deal more insight than could have been obtained by a more aggressive
style.
His success as an interviewer arose from the simple fact that, particularly
where the greats of jazz were concerned, he was an ardent fan. Talking to Dizzy
Gillespie, Count Basie and countless others was a great personal achievement.
When Frank Zappa gave him a frame from his movie off the cutting-room floor
Waugh was genuinely the recipient of a priceless treasure.
In 1990 Waugh took up a post as senior press officer for Glasgow's year as
European City of Culture. Under immense pressure he once again applied his
communication skills to ensuring that Glasgow's status in Europe and beyond was
greatly enhanced. More importantly, he was concerned that local people be kept
informed and involved in the celebrations.
After the hiatus of 1990, Waugh focused once again upon his jazz broadcasting
and also assumed the role of impresario, becoming variously, jazz DJ for Q96 FM
and a co-founder of Basement Jazz. The latter introduced and encouraged new
talent in Glasgow and welcomed many other musicians to the city. In 1992 he was
appointed lecturer in media and communication studies at Falkirk College and in
the years which followed, his professional expertise in radio, his knowledge of
European media and his natural didactic bent inspired his
Waugh's other passions, for the city of Glasgow and the good things of life,
also flourished over this period. He was involved in the campaign to save the
Salon cinema and to create a new visitor attraction in Bellahouston Park,
centred upon the reinterpretation of Tait's Tower.
His compering of the Dunoon Jazz Festival (1994 and 1995) and fronting of the
Fruitmarket at the Glasgow International Jazz Festival (1995) seemed to
pressage another new career for this remarkable, immensely talented, but always
self-effacing charming man. These were perhaps the most public of his many
projects and aspirations, all of which demonstrated his love for Glasgow and
his enthusiasm for its fabric, its culture and its people.

THE Government came under renewed pressure last night to change its system for
making cold weather payments through the Social Security scheme as Scotland
continued to freeze.
The Department of Social Security said that cold weather payments to people in
large parts of the country had been triggered by the Arctic weather and would
be received within days.
However, Opposition MPs, many of whom were freezing with their constituents in
some of the worst weather conditions Scotland has seen for 40 years, said the
Government action was not enough.
The DSS said it had made weather checks with the Meteorological Office and the
payments - of #8.50 a week - would be made across much of the country. A
spokesman said: ``The Met Office say they now anticipate cold weather payments
have been triggered in a large number of areas.''
Details of temperatures nationwide are fed to the DSS by a network of 55
weather stations. Payments are made locally, depending on weather reports for
each area, but are triggered automatically when temperatures fall or are
predicted to fall to freezing or below for a seven-day period in a specific
area.
They are only paid to three groups - income support families with children
under five; the disabled and long-term sick; and pensioners.
For Labour, Mr George Foulkes, MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, and a
former director of Age Concern Scotland, said: ``The weather is so severe that
there ought to be some consideration about a double premium for when it gets
below -10C.''
His Labour colleague, Mr David Winnick (Walsall North), said: ``The Prime
Minister should intervene to authorise payments in all areas of the country.
The weather is sufficiently harsh, and therefore these payments are certainly
justified, modest as they are. It is also unfortunate that anyone just above
the level of income support won't be receiving a penny.''
Scottish Liberal Democrats' leader Jim Wallace, speaking from snow-bound
Kirkwall, said he was concerned about a system whereby one geographical area
might qualify for help on the basis of a forecast while another would not.
He said he would be raising the matter in correspondence with Ministers and on
the floor of the House when the Commons resumed, adding: ``The drawback of the
present formula is that it leads to uncertainty over whether people will
qualify or not. I am concerned there will be a number of cases where people
still do not know whether they can afford to heat their homes.''
SNP leader Alex Salmond said there should be an automatic payment to vulnerable
groups for the winter months, and he claimed there would have been uproar if
Whitehall had been without electricity for three or four days. He joined the
queue of those pledged to raise the issue with Ministers when the House returns
after the Christmas recess.
For the Government, Social Security Minister Andrew Mitchell promised that the
cold weather payments scheme would be kept under review.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ``The Government recognises that hearing
a Government Minister talking about cold weather payments when you have
temperatures of -15C in the north of Scotland can be rather irritating for
those who are battling against those conditions and we do recognise the
importance of an annual review.''
Pressed about situations where the weather had been cold for a prolonged period
but did not meet the Government criteria exactly, he said: ``We have to take a
prudent view. These payments are meant to deal with very severe weather.
``Normal heating costs are met already by income support, so these special
payments deal with exceptional circumstances and we have to take a prudent view
as to what is the right use of taxpayers' money.''

Nan Whyte, violinist and teacher; born May 4, 1922, died December 24, 1995
NAN WHYTE, one of Ayrshire's best-known musicians and a leading light in the
women's Burns movement, died peacefully after a short illness at Crosshouse
Hospital on Christmas Eve, aged 73.
Originally from the Riccarton area of Kilmarnock, she moved to Irvine when the
Caldwell family took over the town's Eglinton Arms Hotel in 1959, and for many
years helped in the day-to-day running of the hotel with her brother Joe.
She quickly became prominent in many of the town's affairs and was, with Anne
Gaw, a founding member of Irvine Lasses' Burns Club. But although Burns was one
of Nan Whyte's great passions, her life revolved around her love of music.
After gaining her LRAM and an MA in English and history at Glasgow University
in the same year, she taught her academic subjects in Kilmarnock. However, she
also continued studying the violin with the celebrated Max Rostall and Alfredo
Campoli and was persuaded to join the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra by its
founder-conductor Ian Whyte. Through him she met and married his son, Don, who
worked with the Scottish Daily Express. The couple had three children.
After her playing days, she taught history and English at Irvine Royal and
Kilwinning Academies, and eventually became a peripatetic music teacher to a
group of Ayrshire schools. She continued to give private lessons up to the time
of her death, but she took most pleasure from striking up a tune at family
gatherings, or accompanying generations of youngsters who took part in
recitations at Irvine Burns Club.
Nan Whyte was also a leading figure behind the Scottish National Youth
Orchestra, and every year travelled to St Andrews and other locations where she
worked with the cream of the country's young musical talent as they prepared
for their annual concert.
She is survived by her children, Iain, Stewart, and Eileen, and grandchildren.
A service will take place on Tuesday at Irvine Old Parish Church (1.45pm) -
when some 20 of her musician colleagues will play in her memory - and the
funeral will follow at Masonhill Crematorium, Ayr (3pm).

JOHN Christie, the Insights Menzieshill captain and sharpshooter, last night
drew a blank when the Dundee side began the defence of the trophy in their own
international invitation indoor tournament at the city's Dick McTaggart Sports
Centre but Kevin Squire was on hand to get them off to a winning start.
The former Scottish under-21 internationalist scored four goals in a 9-3 defeat
of Bett Inns, after having hit he target three times in the opening eight
minutes.
Bett Inns got themselves back into the game with two goals from Neil Devine and
Graham Storrie but this merely prompted Menzieshill to lift their game and by
half-time they had restored their three-goal advantage with strikes by Kenny
Stibbles and Gary Cosgrove.
In the second half, Menzieshill were put under little pressure and they did
just enough to stretch their winning margin to six goals.
Torbrex Wanderers completed a double for the Taysiders when they saw off the
challenge from North American touring side Dita Travellers. The Dundonians ran
out 11-6 winners with Ian Strachan, Paul Dailly, and Steve Gellatly all scoring
hat tricks.
A third Scottish first-division side, Touche Ross Gordonians, lost out in their
confrontation with English champions Old Loughtonians. They were beaten 6-3 but
kept the pressure on the London side to the end. Results:
Insights Mezieshill 9, Bett Inns 3; Dita Travellers 6, Torbrex Wanderers 11;
Touche Ross Gordonians 3, Old Loughtonians 6.

Anne Johnstone discovers how the sales season appeals to the same primitive
urges which were part of the psychology of Stone Age man, and woman
IF SUNDAY was the nightmare before Christmas, Boxing Day was surely the
nightmare after it. Most of the stores which bulged and groaned with Christmas
shoppers right up to close of play on Sunday, were back in business by
lunchtime on Boxing Day, bursting with equally fanatical bargain-hunters.
After losing the fight for the last snowsuit for a three-year-old in C&amp;A in the
Trongate, I mused ruefully on how my rugbyless female state school education
had left me miserably underqualified for the scrum of the Boxing Day sale
scene. I'd fared little better last week. So why do we do it? Are we mad? No,
more like temporarily deranged, according to Glasgow psychologist, Dr Prem
Misra.
Dr Misra says people can develop ``a transient obsession'' with a particular
item, believing it can somehow transform their lives for the better. The
longed-for object may be an electrical item or a piece of furniture but is more
likely to be clothing. ``In extreme circumstances the person obsessively
searches for the item and will go to great lengths to get it, including camping
out on the pavement in sub-zero temperatures,'' says Dr Misra.
When the store is about to open, their autonomic nervous system starts to
produce a rush of adrenalin. They begin to sweat and feel extremely alert even
if they're physically exhausted. Of course, if someone gets to the quarry
first, these feelings can turn into aggression. In other words, the
psychological armoury we use for shopping in the sales is exactly what our
Stone Age ancestors employed for hunting and fighting: the thrill of the chase.
John Davies, professor of psychology at Strathclyde University, says it's the
competitive element in us which drives us back out to the sales so soon after
Christmas. ``It's like a sport, where it's as important to win as to get the
object desired. There's a particular type who are drawn to them: the Attila the
Hun of sales. I'd probably class them as neurotic extroverts.''
Psychologically speaking, different impulses drive us into the shops before and
after Christmas, says Dr Misra. In the run-up to Christmas, he says, a ``siege
mentality'' develops in which people stock up with enough food to last weeks,
even though they know perfectly well that all the basics will be widely
available from Boxing Day onwards. It's an extension of our most basic human
instinct: survival. Hence the Bedlam-like scenes in M&amp;S foodhalls last weekend
with angry shoppers seizing items from each other's trolleys and stampedes to
snatch the final turkeys and mince pies from the shelves.
``People remember when the shops were closed for days, so they retain the
instinct to hoard. Also, this year there was a lot of anxiety about the weather
and fears that it could disrupt food supplies, as well as a lot of concern
about drinking and driving, so people imagined themselves marooned in their
homes for days,'' says Dr Misra.
A different kind of dementia infects the business of Christmas gift shopping,
something which afflicts women much more than men. Women shell out the lion's
share of the #7000m spent on Christmas gifts each year in Britain, and they
start shopping much earlier than men. However, generally they don't finish
earlier. They are just as likely as their men to be queueing at the last till
open at 5.35 on Christmas Eve. They're there clutching that last garland for
the mantle.
That's because many women suffer from a kind of ``Yuletide fantasy''. This is
the myth that there is such a thing as the perfect family Christmas, of the
type depicted in seasonal editions of women's magazines. They go to
extraordinary lengths to fix every last detail, every cashew nut, every gift
tag, every fairy light, in the desperate hope that if all the physical details
are right, they will somehow avoid the family tensions which so often erupt to
spoil the big day.
Ironically, of course, this merely adds to the tensions of Christmas, making a
conflagration all the more likely. More divorce proceedings are instituted
immediately after Christmas than at any other time of year.
But John Davies, an expert on addiction, dismisses the idea of
``Christmasaholics''. ``You've got to draw the line somewhere between what's
addictive behaviour and what isn't. The language of addiction used to be used
for hard drugs and not much more. Then it started spreading to soft drugs, then
things like chocolate and now even Christmas shopping. That's ridiculous. It's
just an excuse for people spending more than they should. As someone who likes
to be out of a shop three minutes after going in, I find it hard to
rationalise.''
While most women expect to enjoy Christmas shopping, most men don't even
pretend to. Few things throw up the difference between the genders more
sharply. While women join with friends and neighbours to make it a fun day out
and may try several stores before selecting the item they want, men prefer to
shop alone. Purposefully they walk into a store, make their choice and are out
again in two minutes, regardless of whether they've made the right choice, let
alone whether it's the right size.
Men's down-to-earth attitudes to seasonal shopping are reflected in a recent
survey, which showed that on a range of virtually identical items for men and
women, those for men were invariably cheaper. According to one psychologist,
women are often buying hope or a promise of glamour and this is reflected in
the price tag. This is the psychology which controls high margins in the
perfume market.
Such differences also explain why husband-and-wife shopping trips rarely work
and why salesmen have such a hard time trying to sell something to a couple
shopping together. Observer columnist Katharine Whitehorn recently suggested a
creche for husbands in every shopping centre.
Of course, even the most reluctant shopper gets there eventually. Dr Misra says
the last-minute shopper is under increasing pressure in the last couple of
weeks, bombarded with more and more images of Christmas, and a mounting tide of
advertising. The result, he says, is that items which nobody would dream of
buying during the rest of the year sell like hotcakes. Will 1995 be remembered
as the Christmas of the foot spa?
Finally, here is a message for the big woman with the sharp elbows who filched
that last toddler snowsuit: I hate you.

THE rate of profits growth enjoyed by Scotland's leading companies has almost
halved in the past 12 months, according to a study published in next month's
Scottish Business Insider magazine.
Surprisingly, it was construction and development which bucked the slowdown,
with the major players achieving a 153% hike in combined profits.
This was largely a result of a turnaround in the fortunes of property
investment company Scottish Metropolitan, although this was based on figures
only for the year to August last year.
The recently-floated Morrison Construction Group increased its latest annual
profits by 50% to #7.63m. And Cala more than doubled its profits in the year to
June to #6.89m.
In spite of the slowdown in overall profits growth from 29% to 15% this year,
many of the big players are recording their best-ever absolute profit levels.
This is particularly true of banks, which together with the life and composite
insurers dominate the top 10 of the leading Scottish companies making up ``the
insider 500''.
And the rate of increase in dividends rose from 13% to 23%. Employee numbers
rose 5.2%.
Stakis and Gleneagles were ahead in the hotels and leisure sector and Dawson
International turned a #98m loss into a #1.7m profit in the year to March to
lead textiles.
Meanwhile, Brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle - fresh from its #425m acquisition of
Courage from Fosters of Australia - increased its payroll by 7426.
Perth-based bus giant Stagecoach, expanding on to railways next year, took 5529
employees under its wing.
Royal Bank of Scotland added 3374 staff as its Direct Line insurance
diversified.
Stagecoach's rapid expansion allowed it to enjoy the largest profits hike among
companies with annual turnover of over #300m. Its top line increased by 77% to
#337m, with pre-tax profits up 72% to a record #32.6m in the year to end-April.

Gus Macdonald is to relinquish the chair of Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival.
Keith Bruce profiles the man who brought the event back into the black
THE question posed in this newspaper when Scottish Television managing director
Gus Macdonald was appointed chairman of the Drambuie Edinburgh Film Festival
was: ``Can he restore the festival's reputation?''
It was not the question at the top of Macdonald's mind. The champion of tabloid
television, who has drastically reduced the workforce at the station's
Cowcaddens HQ, maximised profitablity, defended Scottish from predators in the
new open market, and who tells me that ``a well-informed seven-year-old can
make a passable television documentary'', was more concerned with restoring the
festival's fortunes.
Quiet satisfaction is not something Macdonald indulges in. He's pretty upfront
about those things in which he takes pride and for which he expects credit. As
far as he is concerned, he has done the job at the DEFF and is moving on. He
has attended his last board meeting and relinquishes the chair at the end of
the year. Company secretary Glasgow lawyer Douglas McKerrall and the board
financial mind, Edinburgh accountant Michael Davidson, are searching for a
successor, and it will be a major surprise if that person is not from the world
of television.
Much concern was expressed among Scotland's cinema intelligentsia at the time
of Macdonald's appointment that TV executives were taking over the festival.
Sitting alongside him on the festival board were Steve Morrison from Granada,
Caroline Thomson from Channel 4, and John McCormick, controller of BBC
Scotland. Under Macdonald's regime, the board was slimmed down to a mere nine
souls, so the dominance of the television appointees was undeniable.
However, the misgivings failed to recognise the parallel dominance in the
funding of British film, with Channel 4 the largest movie producer in Europe.
If television has shown itself committed to the sustenance of a British film
industry, it has also proved useful to Edinburgh's festival.
Macdonald - who acknowledges the work done in sorting out the festival's
working structure by previous festival director Penny Thompson - says he wanted
``a board of heavyweights who can deliver support and leave the director and
producer to get on with their jobs''.
That has been achieved in a remarkably short time. A festival with a #150,000
deficit is now in the black and last year's event was a considerable popular
success.
On the funding side, Macdonald identifies three key meetings which changed the
festival's fortunes. Drambuie had been on the point of pulling out of their
sponsorship, but he persuaded then managing director Peter Derbyshire not only
to stay in but increase the commitment in cash and in kind to #200,000 a year -
in return for headline billing.
Lothian Region agreed to a substantial contribution to reduce the festival's
deficit, following a meeting with councillor Eric Milligan, and a chat with
Michael Grade produced more committed support from Channel 4, whose head of
film acquisition, Mhairi Mac-Donald, now sits on the DEFF board. Head of
corporate affairs at Scottish, Dave Whitton, joins on Macdonald's departure.
The new board can now be no more than 12 people, half its previous size, and
there is agreement that any member should resign when they leave the position
that led to their initial appointment. Edinburgh councillor and Filmhouse
chairman George Kerevan left under that rule.
When Macdonald says that he leaves the film festival in the black ``for the
first time in my memory'', he has considerable experience to call upon. He was
deputy chair between 1975 and 1984, and founding chairman of the television
festival in 1976. He still sees the television festival as the offspring of the
film event, something that was set up to demystify television and in no way a
threat to film.
He points to the transition made to the mid screen by directors like Mike (Four
Weddings) Newell. ``We had a slogan in the 70s that British film is alive and
well and it is called TV and we try to make sure there is an overlap, but we
don't want to see TV movies and there is a stubborn cultural difference between
the two.
``The last two years should have dispelled any doubts that we could be on the
point of turning the film festival into a television event. Why? We've already
got one.''
What the television contingent has brought to the festival, he contends, is a
sense of realism and a commercial base. He sees it as desirable that control of
the festival is not in the hands of the movie-making practitioners themselves,
when it becomes a vehicle for their frustrations. Besides, he adds, there is no
independent film-making sector to contest control.
``I hope we have taken it away from the cultish exclusivity of the film people
who take refuge in the theory and aesthetic of film without the industrial
reality,'' he says.
He sees change on the horizon and trusts the new generation personified in
Cousins and Atkinson to make the most of it. ``Penny was at the end of my
generation,'' he said. ``We need to give them the floor and let them dance.''
Advances in technology - and dramatic reductions in costs - are producing a
``wonderful confusion'' in visual story-telling, according to Macdonald.
``You don't have to be Noam Chomsky to know story-telling is innate but a small
country like Scotland couldn't afford to tell stories to itself, so you end up
looking glum and factual. The new economics will allow fiction to be made.''
Macdonald believes that it is in this area that television people have much to
learn from those in the film industry, and he is encouraging colleagues to come
to Edinburgh earlier than their own event in order to attend the film festival.
There is talk of a showcase of the top talent from both.
What of the future for the man himself? With the agreement of the May annual
general meeting he steps into Bill Brown's position as chairman of Scottish
Television at a time when the industry is in the throws of enormous change.
This more strategic role is consistent with his ambitions to expand the
company's interests into England.
Scottish has forged a number of ``alliances'', like that with Scottish Telecom,
that will see it moving into cable and narrowcasting. The company is working on
an association with Hallmark Entertainment in New York to make six children's
films over three years.
Then there are the implications of the Broadcasting Bill and the possibility of
future takeovers, about which Macdonald is prepared to say absolutely nothing,
unsurprisingly. Perhaps it is also unsurprising that he feels the time is right
to clear the decks of other commitments.

n.What lies ahead in '96? Here are some of the films you can look forward to
over the next four months.
JANUARY
Seven: a brilliant but very nasty film about a serial killer who bases each
crime on one of the Seven Deadly Sins. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt star as the
investigating cops. If you thought Silence of the Lambs gruesome, prepare to be
appalled.
Mute Witness: a very funny horror movie set in a Moscow film studio where the
mute props girl working on an American film gets locked in after hours and
finds the Russian crew are making snuff movies on the side. Can she be allowed
to live? There is a surprise guest star.
Heat: Robert de Niro and Al Pacino in a polished thriller about a cold
professional thief and the cop determined to catch him.
FEBRUARY
Les Miserables: the book, not the musical, reset in the present century and
starring Jean Paul Belmondo and pretty well everyone who is anybody in French
cinema.
Sabrina: a remake of the old Audrey Hepburn/Humphrey Bogart comedy with Julia
Ormond and Harrison Ford.
Loch Ness: the one they spent last year making about Nessie with Cheers star,
Ted Danson, giving it transatlantic box-office clout.
Sense and Sensibility: Emma Thompson's version of Jane Austen's novel directed
by Ang (Eat Man Drink Woman) Lee.
Casino: Martin Scorsese, Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci get to grips yet again
with the wise guys, this time in Las Vegas, with Sharon Stone as an alcoholic
slut. It seems the Mob run it no longer. Now the big corporations do. But who
runs them?
MARCH
Money Train: Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes rob the New York subway. The
film features a scene in which a cashier in a booth is torched with an aerosol,
which happened recently in reality provoking much anguish from the film-makers.
Beyond the Clouds: a collection of short stories directed by Michelangelo
Antonioni sensitively linked together by Wim Wenders. Rich in atmosphere, it
stars several of the loveliest young women in European cinema and John
Malkovitch. Antonioni is still one of the masters of the cinema.
Copycat: more serial killing, this time with Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter
doing the chasing. You have been here before, but the stars lend it the
necessary freshness.
Smoke: Wayne Wang's charming look at working-class New Yorkers centred on the
neighbourhood cigar store with Harvey Keitel in a rare sympathetic role.
Stockard Channing is stunning as a tart with a heart.
APRIL
Broken Arrow: John Travolta and Christian Slater star as Stealth bomber pilots,
once close friends, now deadly enemies, who are involved in one of those
no-holds- barred races against time to stop a nuclear weapon from being used
against an American city.
Nelly and Monsieur Armand: Emmanuelle Beart in a Claude Sautet film about a
loving friendship between an old man and a beautiful young woman.
Safe: The talented Julianne Moore as a woman who finds she is allergic to
today's world and ends up trapped in one of those sinister New Age centres.

When academic minds join with Burns enthusiasts next month it's bound to be an
amazing event, says DONNY O'ROURKE.
WHATEVER isn't happening amid the recriminations surrounding the bi-centenary
of the Bard's demise, the world's biggest Burns Conference will take place at
the University of Strathclyde on January 11-13.
Every major authority on Burns will be in attendance. The poet's life and work
will be approached from just about every angle imaginable. Paticipants will
gather from all over the world to celebrate the poems and songs. And I do mean
celebrate.
These aren't the witterings of boring jargon-infected academics. The six
previous conferences have been notable for the entertaining elegance of the
presentations. Constructive controversy and down-to-earth accessible
scholarship have characterised the contributions.
It is to be hoped that Burns himself would thoroughly have enjoyed them. Who'd
pass up a talk entitled No More Potted Houghmagandie, even if the Gaelic poet
Aonghas Macneacil weren't giving it. Who wouldn't want to hear Tom Wright talk
about how John Cairney galloped away with Burns, after he'd written There Was a
Man.
The perspective of other writers, of those working in the media, in advertising
and tourism, of schoolteachers preparing pupils for the new Higher syllabus
(which includes Burns for the first time), of farmers, ministers, masons,
``ordinary'' readers of his work - all these will be on offer.
With biographies of Burns by Messrs McKay, MacIntyre and Bold to argue over, we
have never been in such firm, clear and stimulating possession of the facts.
First the writing: then the flyting. Good natured vituperation has always been
a feature of the proceedings. Facts may be ``chiels that winna' ding'' but
opinions flow fiercely.
A panel format ensure vigorous discussion among speakers. The seminar's theme
is then opened up to audience participation. The conference was dreamed up and
is run by Dr Ken Simpson, director of the Centre for Scottish Studies at
Strathclyde and himself an eminent critic of eighteenth-century Scottish
literature.
Since, from its inception in Glasgow's annus mirabilis 1990, the centre has
been committed to providing a public forum for the dissemination and discussion
of ideas, Dr Simpson is keen that members of the general public sign up for and
take an active part in the Burns event.
``Burns isn't just a Scottish phenomenon, he's a poet of world-class stature
and iconic significance who demands to be taken very seriously indeed. But this
conference is also fun.''
Simpson has assembled a team of participants, including J Ross Roy, Donald Low,
and Thomas Crawford, who are all scholars of long and distinguished standing in
Burns studies. Among the younger speakers are Liam McIlvanney, son of poet and
novelist William; and Kirsteen McCue, whose father is the singer Bill McCue.
Liam McIlvanney, a post-graduate student at Oxford, will discuss Burns and
religion; and Ms McCue, who is director of the Scottish Music Information
Centre, and completing a doctorial dissertation on Burns songs, will talk about
his songwriting.
Other highlights will include John Purser on the musical life of the period,
and Valentina Bold on images of Burns.
Sixty speakers will give papers. Most days' sessions will run in parallel so
that participants can choose one seminar from the three on offer. In this way
it is possible for everyone to compile their own personal programme - to
explore feminism and Burns, say, or specialise in the songs or nationalism, or
the satire.
``When Burns died in 1796, the whole town of Dumfries turned out to honour him.
`Who will be our poet now,' they asked? The conference affirms the importance
of Burns to all Scots. It aims to penetrate to the complex core of an immensely
talented poet, a poet of many and diverse voices.'' So Ken Simpson hopes.
Simpson is impatient with the hoary dichotomies of Burns scholarship. Rather
than set up a slanging match on Art Song vs Folk Song, for example, the
conference will examine the songs from both vantage points, scholar and singer
Adam McNaughton and his colleagues in the group Stramash will let us hear a
Burns who listened to and loved all the music available to him.
The Burns who will emerge from these three days of celebration and deliberation
will be as good a likeness to the real Robert Burns as we are entitled to
expect, given the poet's literary, political and psychological complexity.
And it is apt that Burns, the intellectual self-improver is being feted in the
bi-centenary of the institution that was to become Strathclyde University.
1796: a death and a birth - two centuries of useful learning indeed.
The whole event will be a kind of Burns supper writ large, a ceilidh of ideas.
But on the Friday evening there will be a real ceilidh with some of Scotland's
finest writers and singers, including Jo Miller, Tom Leonard, Carl McDougall,
Edwin Morgan, and McIlvanney pre. Iain Crichton Smith will premiere an
ambitious long poem in Burns's characteristic standard-habbie stanza form.
Tickets for the ceilidh and for the conference as a whole are still available.
There won't be a better Burns event in 1996.

FORTE has decided on a fast track approach to becoming a purely mid to upper
market hotels company by selling its restaurants and the Travelodge budget
hotels to Whitbread for #1050m, conditional on a #3300m Granada bid failing.
The original plan was to demerge the restaurant business, which takes in Happy
Eater, Little Chef, Welcome Break motorway service areas and a similar motorway
service chain in France. Sir Rocco Forte, chairman, believes Whitbread is
offering a premium price.
``It is ahead of the values which the board considers would be created through
demerger and represents the best outcome for shareholders,'' he said.
Granada begged to differ, proclaiming that the price was ``modest'' and was tax
inefficient. Chief executive Gerry Robinson thundered: ``Forte's break-up plan
is an admission of its management's failure to obtain a reasonable return on
its assets.
``Shareholders should question whether it serves their interests to sell a
major part of the group in a hurry, at a time when it is performing badly,'' he
added.
With January 2 being the last date Forte can add new items to its defence,
further news will come out shortly, including a valuation of the hotels and a
dividend forecast, which could include a special payment following the sale to
Whitbread.
Since Forte announced the demerger plan early in December, it has received a
number of approaches for the restaurants.
Analysts suspected that Bass would also have looked at them, but Forte itself
considers Whitbread to be the obvious buyer, given its existing interests,
which include Pizza Hut, Beefeater and 1600 pubs, and expansionist aims in the
sector.
Sir Rocco noted: ``Whitbread is the best buyer, quite simply because it has the
best business fit so it can offer the best price and is not financially
constrained.''
The sale will almost eliminate Forte's gearing enabling it to develop its
remaining hotel brands, Posthouse, Heritage, Meridien and Exclusive, which
includes the Grosvenor House in London.
The chains to be sold made trading profits of #82m on sales of #590m in 1994/95
and Forte has already indicated that in the current year second half profits
would be below the comparable period.
The price represents an exit earnings multiple of 17 times, which Mr Robinson
noted was lower than similar quoted company shares were trading at and
represented no premium for control.
For its money, Whitbread would get 430 Little Chef and Happy Eater restaurants,
26 Welcome Breaks and 127 Travelodge hotels, which are closely associated with
the roadside restaurants. The group expects significant integration benefits.
Chief executive Peter Jarvis said: ``A major attraction to Whitbread is the
synergy which exists between our current businesses and those we are acquiring.
``The combination of activities will provide benefits in areas such as food
procurement and distribution, information systems and customer services,'' he
added.
Whitbread would develop branded restaurants and retail concepts within Welcome
Break and build on the French chain. The Travelodge hotels are a good fit with
Whitbread's Travel Inns. The group says the purchase would be earnings neutral
in the first year.
The deal would reduce Whitbread's brewing activity to a small proportion of the
total group, raising renewed speculation about its long-term future within the
group, which really sees itself as a retailer.
However it appears it wants to retain the business, which is strongly cash
generative, at least for the time being.

A SPARKLING Christmas has been had by Goldsmiths Group, Britain's leading
specialist retailer of up/mid-market jewellery and watches.
The month to Christmas Eve saw sales growth of 15.9% in total and 8.7% on a
like-for-like basis compared with those achieved in 1994. Sales for the 11
months to 24 December 1995 rose by 18.8% in total and 7.7% on a like-for-like
basis. Goldsmiths trades primarily under the Walker &amp; Hall and Goldsmiths name.
In looking for Christmas presents this year consumers generally appear to have
focused on quality rather than quantity. Clothing, household goods and
investment items such as silverware have proved popular.
Hugh Clark, trading policy director of the British Retail Consortium, which
represents over 90% of British retailers, said that overall Christmas had been
``a tough one but a reasonable one''. The trend towards shopping closer to 25
December itself continued, helped in England and Wales by official Sunday
opening by stores.
London stores also benefited from advantageous exchange rates with foreign
tourists snapping up British bargains, particularly designer clothing.
Food stores are thought to have traded particularly well with some superstores
having to close their doors to customers at times last Friday and Saturday
because of overcrowding and hour-long waits at the checkout. This despite the
fact that many stores were open on Saturday until 10pm and for several hours on
Sunday.
The strong Christmas trading may not compensate for a poor start to the autumn
season as unseasonably mild weather depressed clothing sales. However, the
traditional January sales have got off to a good start in amongst others Marks
&amp; Spencer, Debenhams, MFI and Selfridges.
Consumers are unlikely to have lost their desire for good value and so well
known brands of clothing and household goods will be snapped up at discounted
prices. Most retailers publish official statements on Christmas trading in
mid-January.

Following a year of movie disasters and the odd celluloid perfection,
William Russell takes a look back at the best and worst in cinema
THE year's end is a time to look back; a time for hurling brickbats and sending
bouquets; for giving the Willies, as my annual awards are known, to those who
have done good work. For the critic, it is that most thankless of tasks to
decide the 10 best films of the year - thankless because, invariably, one
leaves out those films people have enjoyed most and stands accused of elitism,
snobbishness, and generally not knowing what one is talking about.
However, the giving of pleasure does not necessarily mean something is any
good, only that it has given pleasure, which has nothing to do with taking a
critical view.
My film of the year is Il Postino, Michael Radford's moving account of the
friendship between a young Italian fisherman and the exiled Chilean poet, Pablo
Neruda (played by Philippe Noiret). Impeccably acted, written, filmed and
directed, it is as near perfection as it is possible to be, and should stand
the test of time. What makes the film so rewarding is that it is about how
friendship can liberate somebody trapped in an inhibiting environment, and how
people who offer friendship must also accept the responsibilities entailed.
Noiret is one of French cinema's finest actors, but the actor and comedian,
Massimo Troisi, who played the fisherman, Mario, relatively unknown outside his
native Italy, proves a revelation. An actor of immense distinction and patently
unplumbed potential, he died shortly after completing the film.
The trouble with picking a top 10 is that over the year I have seen nearly 200
films, not counting those at film festivals and, even being ruthless, it is
hard to whittle them down to 10. I ended up with a list of some two dozen
titles, most of which I was reluctant to discard.
There were also the ones I could not stand at any price. The two reviews which
provoked the most ire among readers were Rob Roy and Braveheart. Both films
treated history with contempt. There is no need to be totally faithful -
historical writing is something of a movable feast, the past being open to many
interpretations - and dramatic licence permits changes, but one must be true to
the spirit of events and neither bothered to do so.
In the case of Rob Roy, a costume drama with few pretensions other than to
entertain, although it did that only fitfully, the inaccuracies did not matter
greatly. The wooden performance from the leading man, Liam Neeson, did. But
Braveheart aspired to higher planes and the fact I dared suggest Emperor Gibson
had no clothes provoked the first anonymous abusive phone calls I have ever
received. That is worth reflecting upon.
There are always films which will receive no prizes in anybody's list, but
which are worth mentioning. Meryl Streep's successful foray into the world of
the adventure thriller, River Wild, is a case in point, as was Tony Scott's
masterly job in transforming a bunch of underwater cliches into a tense,
exciting tale in his film about a nuclear submarine, Crimson Tide.
It was a good year for the antipodean cinema with Le Tamahori's powerful, but
hysterical, Once Were Warriors, which dealt with the problems faced by Maoris
in present day New Zealand, P J Hogan's hilarious, but bleak black comedy,
Muriel's Wedding, and Peter Jackson's devastating tale of two teenage killers,
Heavenly Creatures.
Sophistication is rare these days in the cinema, but Fred Schepisi brought it
to the screen perfectly in his treatment of John Guare's play, Six Degrees of
Separation, which boasted fine work from Donald Sutherland - rare these days -
and Stockard Channing recreating her original role, as did Robert Redford with
his highly polished film, Quiz Show, in which Ralph Fiennes made a weakling
interesting while Paul Scofield created a believeable academic, a man of
integrity and intelligence.
It was a year for lavish costume dramas, apart from the two set in Scotland.
From France came the blood-drenched La Reine Margot, in which Virna Lisi did
the full Bette Davis as Catherine de Medici, while from British cinema came the
film director debut of the theatrical wunderkind, Nicholas Hytner, The Madness
of King George, in which Nigel Hawthorne gave the performance of a lifetime.
Over the span of a year, films released early can slip from memory which is why
I plough through my year's reviews, alhough even then things can go astray. Two
which must be mentioned are Lee's Eat Man, Drink Woman, which looked
perceptively at the relationship between an old man and his daughters, and
Burnt By The Sun, Nikita Mikhalkov's story about Stalin's purges in which the
smiles of a summer day turn into a nightmare.
Atom Egoyan's Exotica was a fascinating thriller, in hindsight the more so
because of the fuss due next year over Showgirls, an adult look at the bizarre
phenomenon of lap dancing. Two films worth seeing in tandem were Vanya on 42nd
Street, the late Louis Malle's last film, in which Chekhov's play is performed
under rehearsal conditions in a derelict New York theatre, and the evocative
Country Life directed by Michael Blakemore. Blakemore secured performances one
did not think capable from Sam Neil and Greta Scacchi, did a memorable turn
himself, and provided Kerry Fox with a role which suited her to perfection,
unlike the vamp in Shallow Grave. He translated the setting to Australia just
after the First World War giving the story fresh resonances which did not
detract from the original.
In the age of the Europudding, Ken Loach showed how to make a multi cultural
film with his Spanish civil war drama, Land and Freedom, although whether
anybody in Brussels, where the European script fund throws cash about, has
taken note is another matter. It may not make a star of Ian Hart, but the film
confirmed Loach's range is far greater than one imagined. Nor should one omit
mention of Goldeneye, directed by Martin Campbell, who breathed new life into
the corpse of the Bond series.
The year began with the hugely successful Scottish film, Shallow Grave. It will
be interesting to see whether the director, Danny Boyle, has managed that
fiendishly difficult trick and made a second film worthy of note when
Trainspotting arrives in the New Year. A clutch of young British actors and
directors also made their mark, and with luck more will be heard of Georgina
Cates (An Awfully Big Adventure), Kate Winslett (Heavenly Creatures), Hugh
O'Connor, star, and Benjamin Ross, director (The Young Poisoner's Handbook),
Linus Roach (Priest) and Minnie Driver (Circle of Friends).
Four Rooms was the last film released in 1995. It opened on Boxing Day and
should have closed on Boxing Day. It comprises four stories set in different
rooms of the same hotel on New Year's eve, directed by Allison Anders,
Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Ridroguez and Quentin Tarantino which explodes the
myth that any of them have talent, other than for obscenities and incompetence.

Last week's National Lottery award of almost #400,000 will realise the dream of
a mobile cinema for the Highlands and Islands
CHRIS Ealand clearly recalls the circumstances when he watched Kennedy being
shot. He had been shopping in Inverness with his family and stayed on to watch
the Kevin Costner movie JFK. He remembers it well because it was the last time
he - a self-confessed film buff - was inside a cinema.
Ealand used to run the North West Skye Film Club, but it folded because of
dwindling interest. The club could once depend on around 30 locals to pay to
watch 16mm art house movies in a local hall and latterly a restaurant in
Dunvegan. Gradually, however, the novelty of the projector making more noise
than the movie wore off and increasing costs drove more and more to the video
store.
The choice for Ealand and the rest of the island population is between joining
the video queue or face a round trip of more than 200 miles to the nearest
cinema in Inverness or Fort William.
It is this audience-in-waiting in Skye and other peripheral areas of Scotland
that Hi Arts and the Scottish Film Council are targeting with their plans to
put Hollywood on the road in the Highlands. The mobile cinema project hopes to
emulate the success of the French Cinemobile which is attracting audiences of
30,000 annually in rural areas.
Consultant Dick Penny carried out a feasibility study into the prospects of a
high quality, 100-seater, air-conditioned, cinema, showing the latest
blockbusters on 35mm film rolling into neighbourhoods in Dumfries and Galloway
and the Highlands and Islands. He identified at least 27 possible sites where
the moving cinema could be parked.
Although mobile cinema is not a new concept, the technology available in
France, which will be developed for the UK rather than imported directly, makes
it unrecognisable from its predecessors.
Kevin Cowle, development officer of the Scottish Film Council said: ``What we
have is a 40-foot articulated lorry which opens up like a butterfly into a
luxury cinema. The vehicle ends up three times its original width and has all
the comforts of a normal cinema.''
While Hi Arts Ltd has been the vehicle for the northern project, which will be
commissioned in March and should be operational by September, the ultimate plan
is to build two mobile cinemas in Scotland, and the Scottish Arts Council's
National Lottery committee is expecting an application to cover the Border and
the South West. For the moment, however, it appears that only the Highland
mobile cinema will be operational during cinema's centenary year.
Kevin Cowle says the project has met with nothing but enthusiasm. A visit by
the French vehicle to Moffat first whetted the appetite and was followed by the
vehicle's use at the Celtic Film and Television Festival in Fort William. He
has received a constant stream of correspondence from rural film societies ever
since.
``This is a project which will open up cinema to areas previously deprived of
its riches,'' he says.
Dick Penny is keen to emphasise the mobile screen's potential. ``We are talking
about a high quality cinema experience. It could not be further from the image
of the portable 16mm flickering pictures shown to people in plastic chairs with
the sound booming around a village hall. It is a commercial cinema exercise,
but its also a cultural and social service.''
He points to the growth in cinema audiences, while the number of cinemas has
dropped, although the advent of the multiplex has meant there has been a 45%
increase in the number of screens. The lack of conventional cinemas is felt
particularly in the Highlands and Islands which can boast only three cinemas
and five screens in the entire region - three of them in Inverness.
Paradoxically, the National Lottery is held responsible for a recent slowing in
the increase in cinema attendances as people spend their movie cash on a ticket
and sit in of a Saturday to watch the numbers come up instead. Now the proceeds
of that process are fuelling the mobile screen.
Chris Ealand welcomes the idea, but believes the younger generation may need
convincing. ``The only problem I can see is that we have a video culture
nowadays. Nearly every home has a VCR and it's so easy to pick up films at the
village store. People have been without it for so long in these areas that they
are not used to going to the cinema any longer and so it may need a bit of
re-education about its attractions.''

There is demand for improvement in the care of the mentally ill, but there is
no agreed method of achieving it, finds Mike Dailly
HEALTH care standards at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital were highly criticised
this month with the publication of a leaked report. As Scottish Secretary
Michael Forsyth faces calls to launch a full inquiry, the Government has
announced a Patients' Charter for the mentally ill. But is the charter what
patients need?
A key area of concern at the Royal Edinburgh was that psychiatric patients were
being discharged too quickly, with a resultant breakdown of care as they
returned to the community. The new charter seeks to ensure that the system of
care does not break down and that patients do not have to leave hospital until
it is appropriate to do so.
Many working in the field of mental health may think that the Patients' Charter
is simply tinkering with the system. Earlier this month more than 300
psychiatrists, solicitors, judges and social workers met in Edinburgh to
consider whether the time had come to review fundamentally the 1984 Mental
Health (Scotland) Act.*
Adrian Ward, convener of the Law Society's mental health sub-committee,
believes we should start again from scratch. He says: ``The 1984 Act is hung up
on buildings; that is, detention in hospital. But people shouldn't be
institutionalised. I think compulsory medical treatment should only be looked
at as a last resort.''
Ward is an international expert who can cite European examples which suggest
Britain is lagging behind in mental health law. For example, this year the
courts in Switzerland upheld a woman's right to refuse treatment involving
psychotropic drugs. In Scotland, there is no such choice.
Social policy has changed drastically since the 1980s. Services are now
delivered in a different way, with the emphasis on participation, choice, and
care in the community.
In an attempt to reconcile difficulties, the Government introduced the 1995
Mental Health (Patients in the Community) Act. This legislation creates a new
community care order, which can be granted by the court at the request of a
consultant psychiatrist in order to allow a patient to return to the community
under certain conditions.
But the community care order has more critics than friends. Many believe it
will not be used in practice because it has no legal teeth. The order cannot
impose compulsory medication and if a condition is breached it is not clear
what will happen.
Dr James Dyer, director of the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland, thinks
the community care order has impaired the current legal position.
Dr Dyer says: ``In Scotland we have 123 patients on leave of absence longer
than one year. The majority accept their treatment in the community because if
they don't they can be recalled to hospital.
``I agree that the law is too hospital-orientated, but the 1995 Act sets things
back as it restricts leave of absence to a maximum of 12 months.
``There are people whose illness is such that they don't recognise they are ill
- no amount of improved services would get them to consent to treatment. To say
there should not be a compulsory treatment power in the community is to deny
this fact.''
Yet Dr Tony Maden, a forensic psychiatrist working with criminals who are
mentally ill, is opposed to any extension of psychiatrists' powers.
He says: ``I have a problem with labelling someone living in the community
unfit to decide whether they need treatment. If they can't decide themselves,
shouldn't they be put in hospital?
``I don't think present legislation has been given sufficient time: it's the
application of the law that's a problem. I believe psychiatrists should be more
practical and flexible.
``If you study inquiries into homicides by schizophrenic patients you find
examples of cock-ups by psychiatrists and the tribunals. For example, I can
recall cases where patients on restriction orders in the community were taken
off medication on the advice of psychiatrists and later killed members of the
public.''
Many in Scotland are equally concerned about the idea of compulsory treatment
in the community. As solicitor Hilary Patrick of the Scottish Association of
Mental Health says: ``Is this just care in the community on the cheap? A
compulsory treatment order would presumably say `take x milligrams of
tranquillisers or present yourself at the hospital for an injection'. You would
then be expected to stagger off into the sunrise. How would it be enforced?''
Although there may be differing views as to the best way to deal with mental
illness, there seems to be a growing consensus that fundamental change is
necessary. As Lynn Welsh, mental health solicitor at the Legal Services Agency,
says: ``The Mental Health Act needs to be completely rethought. The Act should
be scrapped and we should start with the presumption that someone should not be
detained. That presumption could be rebutted with appropriate evidence. If the
Government does agree to a fundamental review, then substantial input should be
sought from groups other than just psychiatrists.''

Q. I see you've been talking about cholesterol levels in The Herald. My problem
is I have absolutely no concept of what this stuff is! Does it float around in
your blood like icebergs? Is is true there is ``good'' cholesterol and ``bad''
cholesterol?
A. Cholesterol is actually a kind of fat which is carried around in your
bloodstream. It's rather like those greasy dollops you can sometimes see in
thick cream. And if you've got too much, it rapidly starts silting up your
coronary arteries - which is very bad news indeed.
In most people, the amount of cholesterol in the blood can be reduced to
healthy levels just by eating a more sensible diet - that is, one which
contains little animal fat, plus a reasonable amount of fibre. Exercise also
helps get it down.
Now sir, you're quite right in saying that there are ``good'' and ``bad'' types
of cholesterol. Most of the cholesterol in your blood is the bad kind which
helps cause heart disease. But a wee bit of your cholesterol is a different
sort, ``high density'', and is actually quite good for you. So, anyone who goes
to the doc for the result of a cholesterol test should ask whether the high
density portion is okay, as well as enquiring about the total reading.
Q. My son, aged 16, tells me he has had a pain in one testicle for a day or
two. He did not like to mention it initially, because of embarrassment. Should
I send him to the doctor's?
A. Immediately! Unfortunately, very few people realise there's a serious, and
not uncommon, condition called ``torsion of the testicle''. What happens is the
testicle becomes twisted on its ``stalk'', causing pain. All too often, the
victim ignores the symptom because of embarrassment,          and just puts up
with the pain for several days.
Sadly, the result may well be gangrene - and the testicle may have to be
removed. To prevent such tragedies, all males should be taught from an early
age that unexpected pain in one testicle is a good reason for an urgent
examination by a doctor.
Q. How often should a man have his blood pressure checked? I have been told I
suffer from low blood pressure, but I don't know how often to get it measured.
A. In Scotland and the UK generally, low blood pressure is not regarded as an
illness, but as a cause for congratulation - since it's associated with long
life and a low risk of heart disease! Things are different on the Continent,
where many physicians view low blood pressure as a disease, which they think
should be treated. I'm afraid you just have to accept that different countries
take different attitudes.
Now, how often should a male get his BP checked? It depends on age; when a man
is young there's really little point in having your blood pressure checked. In
a chap of (say) 25, the chance of it being significantly abnormal is remote.
I'd suggest male readers should follow this plan: age 30 to 39, BP check every
three years; 40 to 49, BP check every two years; 50 or over, BP check every
year. Obviously, any man whose pressure turns out to be raised will need more
frequent checks.
Q. I have been suffering from the most horrible tension at home over the last
week or so. I'm ashamed to admit it, but I could very easily belt my children,
and also my wife. Being cooped up with them in the same room for even a few
minutes seems to drive me into a fury, mainly because the noise the kids make
is absolutely unbearable. Am I going mad?
A. No, but you're clearly showing symptoms which could develop into a
full-blown neurosis, if you don't take action fast. I don't know why you're
reacting this way, but I'd guess there have been some major stresses in your
life in recent months.
The important thing to do now is to take the pressure off yourself. Do not let
yourself get ``cooped up'' with your children or your wife. If you feel
yourself getting irritable, go out: for a walk, or to the pictures, or anything
(but preferably not down the pub). Finally, if your GP has an appointment free
today, please go along and get some counselling.
Q. My wife and I have had trouble conceiving a baby, and it turns out this is
due to the fact I have a low sperm count. Is it true I can improve our chances
by keeping the lower part of my body cool? I'd do anything - even wear a kilt!
A. Well, it is true a hot environment lowers a man's sperm count. That's why
guys who do a lot of driving sometimes have fertility problems, because the
scrotum gets decidedly overheated during long journeys. Similarly, males who
wear tight, ``jockey-style'' underpants may find their fertility is a little
impaired.
In general, a man can help ensure maximum fertility by keeping his personal
parts reasonably cool. For instance, you can wear boxer shorts instead of tight
pants. A lot of chaps try to improve their chances by dipping their testicles
in cold water just before they make love. But there's no point in this, because
the process of sperm-manufacture takes around six weks.
My best advice is to wear loose clothing at all times. I'm a little doubtful as
to whether wearing the kilt would help, because from personal experience I can
tell you it's a surprisingly warm garment.
Q. What is a hernia? Is it the same thing as a rupture? I've noticed a bulge in
the lower right-hand side of my tummy for several months. When I mentioned it
to a nursing friend, she said it might be a hernia. Is is true that they can
affect your sex life?
A. This swelling must be checked out by our doc to see if it really is a
hernia. A hernia is exactly the same thing as a rupture. They can occur in all
sorts of places, but by far the commonest site is the groin. I'm assuming
that's where your particular swelling is.
Men are much more liable to groin hernias than women, because the male
abdominal well has a weak spot where the spermatic cord goes through.
A rupture is a bulge through the abdomen wall, rather as if the stuffing was
trying to escape from a sausage. People tend to blame ruptures on lifting heavy
loads, but there are many factors which can cause them: a congenital weakness,
being overweight, being pregnant (not in your case, I pressume), and coughing
heavily over a long period of time.
The best treatment is to get it operated on - in case it causes trouble and
pain as it gets worse. To get the best advice about choice of surgeon and type
of operation, consult your GP. Finally, you ask if a rupture will affect your
sex life. No, it won't.
Q: I'm 19 and I like to have one cigarette a day with my pals. Am I right in
thinking this couldn't possibly do me any harm?
A: Well, you're absolutely right, young sir. A single cigarette per day cannot
have any effect on the health of a fit man. But - and it's one of those big
``buts'' - the trouble with cigarettes is they contain the highly addictive
drug nicotine. So in a little while your brain may start urging you to have
another..... and another. Prenez garde.
n.If you have a query about your health, write to Dr David Delvin at The
Herald, 195 Albion Street, Glasgow G1 1QP. Dr Delvin cannot reply in person,
but he will try to respond in this column. Your name will not be published.

Patrick Laurence, in Johannesburg, examines the divisions emerging in the ANC's
broad alliance, which could prove costly in a future South Africa without
Nelson Mandela
NELSON MANDELA's African National Congress stands over South Africa like a
political colossus, having trounced its rivals in the November local government
elections to record its second emphatic electoral triumph since April last year.
Its dominance is due in part to its success in forging a broad alliance. But
even now, only 20 months after the ANC's decisive victory in the 1994 General
Election, there are unmistakable signs of stress within the alliance.
At its core, the alliance consists of the ANC, its long-time ally the South
African Communist Party (SACP), and South Africa's largest trade union
federation, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu).
But attached more loosely are a series of ANC-aligned organisations, including
the South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) and the Congress of
Traditional Leaders of South Africa (Contralesa).
The most audible dissonance comes from Cosatu, which has objected strenuously
to ANC plans to ``restructure state assets'' by selling some of them, in part
or whole, to private investors.
Expressing dismay at ANC plans, Cosatu has already organised a two-hour work
stoppage to signal its opposition to ``unilateral restructuring'' and announced
its intention to launch a one-day national strike on January 16 to underline
its resistance.
SACP leader Jeremy Cronin has accused the press of misrepresenting the
situation, of ``restructuring the truth'' by exaggerating the divergence
between the ANC and Cosatu. He predicts that Cosatu's objections will be
addressed in discussions aimed at forging an agreed ``national framework'' for
restructuring.
While Mr Cronin's criticisms of press coverage of ANC-Cosatu differences may be
justified in part, there is no doubt that Cosatu has serious misgivings about
the process of restructuring or - to use the label favoured by the press -
``privatisation''.
The alternative is to view the work stoppages - which began with wildcat
strikes within four days of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's announcement of ANC
plans to sell state assets - as a charade put on by Cosatu secretary-general
Sam Shilowa to impress his followers and to camouflage his own complicity in
ANC ``privatisation'' plans.
Mr Cronin's prediction that a unifying consensus will emerge may be proved
correct. Both sides have too much to lose from a major fallout. The ANC is
reluctant to relinquish its image as the champion of black workers. Cosatu
still wants the ANC to remain in power, whatever anxieties it may have over
restructuring.
But there is no denying that the once-cosy ANC-Cosatu relationship has come to
an end. The coalescence of aims - ending rule by the white minority and its
black auxiliaries - no longer exists.
As the dominant party in the government of national unity, the ANC finds itself
playing the role of employer in the public sector and thus is in an adversarial
relationship with public sector unions, most of which are Cosatu affiliates.
The ANC has had to resist demands for wage increases to fulfil its commitments
to reduce the public service bill and balance the budget.
The relationship is influenced adversely by another factor. The new, emerging
elite of black entrepreneurs and moguls increasingly has the ear of ANC
ministers. Their agenda is necessarily different from that of Cosatu as the
voice of its 1.6 million members in mines, factories, offices and shops across
the land.
Mr Shilowa recognises that, as his condemnation of black entrepreneurs who
favour privatisation shows. After castigating the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank for ``prescribing a remedy of doom'' to the ANC government,
he says: ``The same goes for the emerging black elite which is also fighting
for the handing over of state assets . . . In the name of black economic
empowerment, they wish to steal public resources and put them in the hands of a
few black individuals.''
Similar though less vocal discord emanates from Sanco. Formed out the civic
associations which emerged in black townships in the 1980s, Sanco branches are
meant to provide local leaders to seek redress for local grievances and
fulfilment of local aspirations.
But according to Ivor Chipkin, of the Centre for Policy Studies, local leaders
are often shoved aside at election time in favour of party loyalists nominated
by the ANC leadership.
Thus in Phola Park, a strongly pro-ANC squatter settlement located on the
fringe of the Johannesburg megalopolis, dissatisfaction continues to simmer
over the failure of the local Sanco chairman and the local ANC chairman to
secure nomination as ANC candidates in the November 1 election.
A recent outburst of violence in Phola Park, in which five people were killed,
is attributed to discontent over the selection of candidates for the local
government election. It is seen as a bloody manifestation of intra-ANC violence.
Tom Lodge, professor of political studies at the University of Witwatersrand,
warns against interpreting rivalry over places on the ANC list of candidates -
Sanco agreed that its members should stand under the ANC banner in the local
government elections - ``as profound ideological disputes''.
But, he predicts, the ANC's control over local government structures will bring
it into conflict with sections of the black community on issues such as the
refusal to pay for municipal service charges or the eviction of squatters from
municipal ground.
Tension is also brewing between the ANC and Contralesa over the ANC's failure -
as many chiefs see the situation - to safeguard the interests of traditional
leaders in the new order.
The great strength of the ANC has been its ability to mobilise the black
community as a whole and to subordinate incipient class conflicts, whether
between workers and capitalists, commoners and chiefs, to the greater cause of
ousting white minority government.
Now that a predominantly black government is in power, cracks are emerging as
the disparate allies pursue different agendas. President Mandela, aged 77, has
prestige and charisma to hold the alliance together. But after he goes it may
slowly start to break up.

Leicester 51, Barbarians 25
LEICESTER exploded with six second-half tries to equal a couple of records with
a half-century win over the Barbarians in this tradi- tional post-Christmas
extravaganza.
With wings Rory Underwood and Steve Hackney each streaming in for a brace of
tries, Leicester reached 51 points to equal their highest score in the fixture
that goes back to the first decade of the century.
Two years ago they also achieved 51 and yesterday's win was their fourth in
succession over the scratch team, equalling their best sequence, which they
have managed twice before.
The Barbarians seemed to have done all the hard work by leading at half-time
and becoming familiar with each others' styles in the first 40 minutes.
But the combination from seven nations, which included 10 internationalists,
cracked after the break and Leicester banged in their half-dozen scores in a
30-minute spell before the invitation team collected two late, irrelevant
scores.
Details:
Leicester - R Underwood 2t, Hackney 2t, Back 1t, Kardonni 1t, Richards 1t;
Harris 5c, 2p.
Barbarians - Berek 1t, Proctor 1t, Straeuli 1t; King 2c, 2p.

TANGIBLE professionalism has arrived. The Diary can reveal that Stirling
County, who narrowly failed to retain the championship this season, have agreed
to pay their players #60 a game, to be backdated to the start of the season,
with a bigger sum to be given to the players depending on how far they progress
in the Tennents Cup. The club also have decided to pay the coaches for their
contribution to the team's effort this season.
Surprisingly, that hasn't pleased everyone at Stirling. Club second row Stewart
Hamilton said in confirmation: ``I am actually against rugby being
professional, but yes the club have said that we are to be paid and we would be
getting more if we had won the league. There is a bonus system in place, and
the coaches are to be paid too.
``It has now gone so far that you can't stop it. I really think that we have
the type of game that would be best left unpaid because it is just so physical.
We understand that two other clubs in the first division, Melrose and Heriot's,
are getting money also. As I understand it, County are fairly well off at the
moment because of the Barbarians game at Forthbank and some healthy gates.''
Forwards coach Jim ``Muff'' Scobbie says it's good news. ``I get expenses at
the moment. I think that the coaches should be in line with the players, but I
haven't heard directly from anyone that Brian Edwards and I are to get paid
like the players,'' says the former Glasgow prop.
``There's no doubt that the players should be getting paid, and all you have to
do is look at our last few crowds to realise that. The players are now taking
the field in front of in excess of 4000 spectators at times.''
But Melrose, one of the clubs mentioned by Hamilton, say they are not parting
with any money at the moment. ``Nobody at Melrose is being paid,'' says
secretary Stuart Henderson. ``But we are, of course, considering it because of
the threat to our players from down south.''
All of which means that any lingering possibility of an amateur club base in
Scotland will fade into the mist. Earlier this week the international players
signed contracts with the SRU which granted possible earnings of #23,000 in the
season, but the Stiring County move now sets a benchmark of the order of #2000
per season for the other clubs in Scotland to follow. None of which matches the
#50,000 reported to be coming the way of Newcastle's players annually.
The City of Glasgow's clubs, among them second division West of Scotland, see
County's approach as logical. ``It was always going to come,'' says club
president Alasdair Burnet. ``We haven't got the money to do the same, but we
have been trying to look after our players as best we can. We are very
conscious that our talented youngsters might be attracted away by #60 a week,
and they have been approached by other clubs already. We have a players' fund
ourselves where we ask our club members to contribute and the cash goes to the
players. We have also said that all the money we get from the cup will be
spread among the players. But club loyalty is definitely going to suffer.''
Stirling County are one of the big clubs wanting to play in Europe, which would
no doubt put more lolly on the table, but the Diary understands that there are
many in Stirling County who do not agree with that stance. They say that no
Scottish club is strong enough, or has enough strength in depth, to take on top
class foreign opposition and so districts should represent Scotland.
So, a club in Scotland is to play its players #60 a week as a basic weekly
wage. Handy pocket money? Well, it's worth pointing out that a single person's
old age pension for 1995/96 is #59.15 a week. It's a funny old world isn't it?
The Diary suspects that the government has it wrong, but then we should never
mix politics and sport they say. Money talks, that's what we say, and there
will be a few steps taken in Stirling's direction over the summer if this keeps
up - or if other clubs fail to do the same.
q THIS little Diary had awarded Stirling County with the No Foreigners prize
for doing so well without resorting to the import of a few Antipodeans in
pursuit of short-term success.
We said they were the only side without them. But John Thorburn, the Hawick
secretary, phoned up to put the record straight.
``After having some in the past we have no foreigners in our team this year,''
says Thorburn. ``In fact we don't even have any Dundee players in the squad
either.'' Ouch.

Bogus posters
J
JIMMY Reid claims that there are ``existing photographs, taken this century, of
official British posters in the coastal towns of China which state, `Dogs and
Chinese not allowed on these premises' '' (December 23).
Not only would I query the validity of such photographs but I can assert that
they were most certainly not ``official British posters''.
On April 13, 1994, the Daily Telegraph carried a report from a Chinese magazine
called Century which admitted that the infamous signs said to have been erected
in front of Shanghai's waterfront Huang Pu Gardens were made for propaganda
purposes by the Communist Party after the 1949 revolution.
This lie obtained further publicity in the West through a Bruce Lee film and,
unfortunately, continues to do the rounds.

<TEXT>
CLAIMS that a survey has shown that more than 4000 phosphorus bombs washed
ashore on Scottish beaches came from the Beaufort's Dyke munitions dump were
stonewalled by the Ministry of Defence last night.
The official report of the survey carried out by scientists at the Scottish
Office marine laboratory in Aberdeen will not be published until next month but
it is believed to state that the devices orginated from the Dyke, a trench in
the North Channel between Stranraer and Belfast.
The scientists who took part are understood to have decided it is ``now beyond
reasonable doubt'' the bombs were dislodged by British Gas pipe-laying
operations.
The Ministry of Defence dismissed the claims as ``pure speculation''. However,
it said earlier this year that more than one million tons of explosive and
chemical weapons had been dumped in the Dyke.
An MoD spokesman said: ``The report into the Government ordered survey is not
due out until the middle of next month. Any comments regarding the situation on
what may have led to explosives appearing on beaches, or where they came from
is pure speculation at this stage.''
About 4400 highly flammable phosphorus sticks were washed on to beaches in
western Scotland in October, arousing claims that they had been disturbed by
British Gas contractors who had begun digging a 6ft deep trench for a
cross-channel pipeline in the sea bed north of the Dyke.
The MoD said last month that the devices came from decayed 30lb incendiary
bombs of a kind dropped by British aircraft in the Second World War. It was
suggested that they could have been dredged up from another underwater
explosives dump at Birch Point, two miles east of Arran.
The marine laboratory report into the Birch Point dump says, however, it was
not used for MoD disposals, but for commercial explosive waste from the
ICI/Nobel's works at Ardeer, Ayrshire.
Mr George Foulkes, Labour MP for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, has called
for a halt to all commercial activity near the Dyke until a detailed survey of
the area has been completed.
Mr Foulkes has written urging Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth to stop
further consideration of the proposed electricity Interconnector linking the
Scottish grid with Ulster until the present surveys of the seabed in the North
Channel are completed and given careful consideration.

<HEADLINE>Charter aims to reassure on mentally ill</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>974667856</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE Government is to introduce a Patient's Charter for the mentally ill to
overcome growing public concern about schizophrenics involved in vicious
assaults.
Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell said yesterday he would set tough new
standards designed to make the streets safer by reducing the threat to the
public from attacks by severely disturbed psychiatric patients.
The Mental Health Patients Charter will ensure:
q Patients get help from nurses or social workers, if they need it, after
discharge.
q Home visits within four hours for urgent cases and within two working days
for non-urgent cases.
q Patients will not be sent home if it is thought there could be the slightest
risk to carers, relatives, or the public.
q Tough new time limits for assessing a patient's illness to reduce waiting
lists.
q Information on the effects of drugs and alternative treatments will be
available.
q Patients will be allowed to wear their own clothes, have personal
possessions, and have more privacy in hospital.
q Patients can expect access to a lawyer if necessary and will be able to
choose the gender of their key worker.
q Explanation of diagnosis.
q Anyone detained for 28 days or more has the right to apply to a Mental
Health Tribunal and get a medical opinion from an independent doctor.
Mr Dorrell hopes the charter consultation, to start in the new year, will go
some way towards quelling public fears about schizophrenics which began in 1992
when Jonathan Zito was killed by Christopher Clunis at a tube station.
Last August Health Minister Gerald Malone warned NHS chairmen to improve
standards and stop patients falling through the Care in the Community net.
They were asked to review their services and report back to the Secretary of
State. He is due to announce the outcome of this exercise shortly.
But there is no doubt the Government's policy of allowing patients more freedom
has been fraught with difficulties.
Mr Dorrell said: ``When there's public comment about the mental health
services, people often latch on to the phrase `Care in the Community' and say
this means the Government is not interested in hospital care, which isn't true.
``The phrase has become misleading because it has come to imply that the only
type of mental health service we are interested in delivering is one based on
community health and that is not the case.''
The mental health charity, Mind, said schizophrenics needed more help, not a
charter. Spokeswoman Kate Harrison also pointed out that there was no evidence
of an increased risk of violence to the public from such patients.
She said: ``It is the case that services for people with schizophrenia are not
good enough.
``We need more resources across a spectrum of services from decent housing and
occupations to social support.''
Too many champions 12
Stealth claim
THE Government was yesterday accused of the underhand privatisation of NHS
medicines by a health management expert.
Escalating prescription charges, the ``blacklisting'' of drugs, and the removal
of medicines from the prescription register all add up to a form of
privatisation, according to Mr Alan Earl-Slater, a research fellow at the
Health Services Management Centre, Birmingham University.
Writing in Public Money and Management, published by the Chartered Institute of
Public Finance and Accountancy, he claimed the Government was following the
policy ``without either admitting it or having the mandate to do it''.

n.AT last men are beginning to take their health, and drinking habits,
seriously. The current issue of Men's Health magazine gives a stern warning:
``Drink according to your size. A 10-stone man can only handle about half as
much alcohol as an 18-stone one.''
It offers further hints on good drinking habits including the following:
``Drink slowly on a full stomach. This means the alcohol is metabolised before
it can build up in your bloodstream and start attacking your brain.
``Avoid drinks containing `congeners' - substances that add flavour and colour
to alcohol but increase the agony of excess. Vodka is kindest, while Cognac,
brandy, whisky and champagne are the worst transgressors. Avoid red wine, it
produces a killer of a headache. Take a herbal supplement containing
`Silymarin' (Milk thistle). Clinical trials show this stimulates protein
production in liver cells and hastens regeneration of liver cells poisoned by
alcohol and other environmental toxins.''
n.CHILDREN born to older fathers or coal-miners are at increased risk of
developing Alzheimer's disease, according to a major research project which
looked at the risk of the disease in Scotland. The study, carried out by
Professor Lawrence Whalley and colleagues at Aberdeen University, found the
disease was more prevalent in Glasgow, North Lanarkshire and Edinburgh.
This is the largest, and only national, sample so far in the world and involved
450 Alzheimer sufferers and 1784 early dementia cases recorded between 1974 and
1988.
Jan Killeen, Director of Public Policy for Alzheimer's Scotland, Action on
Dementia, welcomed the results: ``One part of the study suggested there were
clusters of people with Alzheimer's in highly urbanised areas, while the other
linked dementia with diet and deprivation in coal mining areas. This is the
first time this link has been made and a lot more research is needed to look at
other incidents in other occupational groups in order to make comparisons and
to explore more of the links betwen occupation and environment.''
n.PERSONAL development guru Jack Black urges charities to ``positively think
bigger''. He says that in today's fast changing world no company can afford to
keep cynics on board. ``Cynics are yesterday's men and women,'' he told a
champagne breakfast organised on behalf of the Scottish Council for Spastics'
Business Breakfasts in Edinburgh. This was the first of four events sponsored
by Scottish Airports aimed at raising #36,000 to fund the society's work in
providing a range of services for children and adults with cerebral palsy and
other disabilities.
n.THE festive season can be a lonely time when you are recently bereaved or
missing someone who has died, and it is important you do not neglect your
health. Free and confidential advice on dealing with grief and bereavement is
available from the NHS Helpline on 0800 22 44 88 any weekday between 9am and
5pm. The counsellors can also help ease any other health worries with
information on a wide range of topics.
n.MAKING New Year resolutions should be positive and not a source of guilt,
otherwise they can lead to feelings of guilt and depression - the last thing
you need during the dreich days of January and February. This advice comes from
ARISE, the Association for Research into Science and Enjoyment, a non-political
body of scientists and academics.
``Denying yourself your favourite treat at a time when you are already feeling
low potentially increases stress and encourages depression. This is made worse
by feelings of guilt when you break a New Year's resolution,'' says Professor
David Warburton, director of the Human Psychopharmacology Group at the
University of Reading and co-ordinator of ARISE.
n.STRESS can increase a woman's risk of breast cancer. For a long time it has
been suspected that stress can induce physical ill-health but this has been
mostly unproven. However, a new study, reported in the British Medical Journal,
focused on 119 women who were being investigated for breast disease. It was
found that events such as divorce, the death of a parent, or loss of a job
during the five years prior to diagnosis increased the risk of breast cancer
approximately three-fold. But this factor increased to nearly 12-fold after
adjustment for age, menopausal status, and other potential factors. Lesser
adverse life events were also found to be strongly linked to breast cancer.
n.Yesterday's ``Those falling spirits'' story in Wednesday Extra was wrongly
attributed to Kennedy Wilson. The article was written by Nicholas Powell.

SCOTLAND'S culinary record is about to improve with plans to set up the first
chefs' training school north of the Border.
The Scottish Chefs Association plans to open the centre within the next 18
months at a city venue.
The school will train chefs on all aspects of cooking, from breakfasts to
advanced dinners, as well as running courses on meat, fish, game, and
vegetables.
It will also have a separate training kitchen for patisserie and chocolate work
and will house a recipe book library and a cooking careers centre. The
association, set up two years ago by a dozen top Scottish chefs, now has about
300 members.
It has conducted almost 50 training courses so far and the first three-day
residential course for young chefs will begin in February.
Mr Nick Nairn, a chef and member of the association's advisory board, said:
``Setting up a training school has been one of our aims from the beginning. It
is the logical extension of two years of running training courses.''
Mr Brian Hannan, the association's organiser, said: ``We want to create for
cooks a similar level of training that is available for musicians. Scotland has
spent millions of pounds on improving the food business infrastructure but
virtually nothing on improving cooking.
``It has great potential to be a force on the global culinary scene. The school
will be a huge practical step towards fulfilling that potential.''

I WAS indeed sad to read about the two masked men with axes who stole a church
collection. The housekeeper and the assistant priest have my sympathy. I trust
the thieves will soon be caught and I hope the Lord will change their minds and
make them repent of their deeds and return the money.
However, what was the money doing there anyway? It is beyond belief that the
money was kept in eight carrier-bags, and even more so that it was in the
possession of a priest and not in a bank night safe.
Surely the Roman Catholic Church does not normally work this way. If so it is
time it changed its procedures. In Presbyterian churches the offering is
counted immediately after the service and it would then go straight to the
night safe where possible. It would certainly not go anywhere near the manse.

HIGHLAND Regional Council is bidding for a share of #150m of European funding,
for developing a coastal zone management scheme.
The bid, which will be based on exploratory studies carried out in the Skye
area, comes after the issue was given a high profile for the first time by the
European Commission this autumn.
A paper from the commission notes that the European Union has 89,000km of
coastline, with a significant proportion of the population being dependent on
the coastal zone, but that over the years, habitats, dune systems, wetlands,
and other environmentally important features are disappearing, and that the
quality of coastal waters is declining.
The commission admits that while many measures have been taken to protect the
environment, nothing has been aimed specifically at the coastal zone, and it
blames this on a ``lack of co-ordination between the numerous actors
influencing the development of the coast''.
While there are many areas in Britain, and in the Highlands especially,
considered worthy of protection and management, areas in Spain, Greece, Italy,
France, and Germany especially, are keen on getting coastal zone management
schemes, and the attendant funding in their area.
Highland Regional Council has already begun a coastal zone management study in
Skye, covering an area described as ``a box drawn around Skye, and extended
until it touches the mainland''.
This has already yielded 12 ``position'' papers, setting out a baseline of
uses, prepared by agencies ranging from the Ministry of Defence to ferry
operators, fishermen, aquaculture, and tourist operators.
So far, however, there has been no money available to take the study on to the
next stage - a pilot project on how the different agencies could co-operate to
manage the area of the coastal zone in which they are involved.
Highland regional officials see this as a chance to bring more money into the
area, and have put in an initial bid for studies that would involve Skye and
the Cromarty Firth, which has been designated as a Special Area of Conservation
under the EC Habitats Directive, and a Special Protection Area under the EC
Birds Directive - both of which could cause conflict with the existing and
developmental potential of the area in relation to oil and heavy industry.
The EU paper makes it clear that several pilot studies could be undertaken in
different countries facing different problems in the coastal zones. It notes
that funds could be made available under EU programmes already up and running
in the Highlands and Islands.

Manchester United 2,
Newcastle 0
ANDY Cole picked the perfect time to justify Alex Ferguson's faith in him and
hit Kevin Keegan where it hurts by gunning down his former club to breathe new
life into the title race.
Doubts had been raised over Ferguson's #7m gamble after last year's title
disappointment and this season's goal famine. The question marks were made even
bigger by the stunning form of Cole's St James' Park replacement, 21-goal Les
Ferdinand.
But on a night when Old Trafford's biggest crowd of the season knew that only a
win was good enough, it was Cole who set Ferguson's men on their way with a
glorious goal.
With Roy Keane capping his own non-stop display with a decisive second after
the break, United deservedly cut the gap to seven points as Newcastle slipped
to only their third defeat of the season.
Cole's goal was everything Ferguson had demanded of him. Just six minutes had
gone when a Newcastle attack broke down, and as they struggled to reorganise,
Ryan Giggs floated down the left.
Cantona - inspirational as skipper for the day - drew the Newcastle defence
like moths to a flame with a sublime dummy run, but that was surpassed by
Cole's emphatic, first-time finish, the ball nestling in the bottom corner
within a fraction of a second of leaving his right foot.
It was a goal that summed up the innate touch of the master-goalscorer, who had
netted 68 times as a Newcastle player.
Try as Newcastle - hampered by the early departure of the man who moved the
other way in January, Keith Gillespie - did, they were always second best from
then on, the victory margin no more than the home team deserved.
Cantona's captaincy was a consequence of the absence of Steve Bruce, and with
Gary Pallister also injured and Paul Parker ill, Gary Neville was drafted in
alongside David May at the heart of the defence.
It was a change that worked in United's favour, for Dennis Irwin, switched to
the right to accommodate Philip Neville, handled David Ginola with surprising
ease, while Ferdinand was unable, in the first half, to put the central
defenders under pressure.
Ferguson had bemoaned his crop of injuries, but the return of Giggs gave them
pace on the break, and Keane's power in midfield had Rob Lee and Peter
Beardsley forced on to the back foot.
Even so, after five games without a win, Ferguson's team needed a vibrant
start, and that was exactly what they made.
In 53 minutes, the die was cast. Newcastle seemed to have cleared the danger
when a corner was worked out as far as Philip Neville, but that was discounting
Keane's attacking instincts.
Neville did see the Irishman stealing forward, delivering the perfect diagonal
ball and as Newcastle looked for the flag Keane controlled and lashed home.
MANCHESTER UNITED - Schmeichel, Irwin, May, G Neville, P Neville, Keane, Butt,

NEWCASTLE - Srnicek, Barton, Peacock, Howey, Beresford, Lee, Clark, Ginola,
Beardsley, Ferdinand, Gillespie. Substitutes - Watson, Kitson, Elliott.
Referee - P E Alcock (Redhill, Surrey).
q LEEDS moved up to eighth in the Premiership table with a 2-0 win at Bolton -
but the United players believe they should be even higher.
Skipper Gary McAllister said: ``You look at the quality of players we have got
at this club and eighth isn't good enough.'' Defender David Wetherall, who
headed the second Leeds goal in 63 minutes to kill off bottom-placed Wanderers,
added: ``We are a better team than that and now we've got to prove it.''
Tomas Brolin, the #4.5m signing from Parma, had opened the scoring five minutes
before the break.

US consumer confidence fell in December as the holiday season failed to
brighten Americans' outlook for the economy, the Conference Board said
yesterday.
The research and business group said its US consumer confidence index fell to
98.7 from a revised 101.6 in November.
The widely watched expectations component of the index fell to 91.7 from a
revised 92.5 in November. The present situation component slid to 109.2 from a
revised 115.3 in November.
``Overall, the consumer confidence index has hovered around the 100 mark
throughout the year,'' said Edgar Fiedler, vice president at the Conference
Board.
Less than 17% of consumers expect fewer jobs to be available in the next six
months, down from more than 18% in November, while fewer respondents expect
their family's income to increase.
About 23% of survey respondents say that business conditions are ``good'', down
from almost 28% in November.-Reuter

THE North Korean army appears to be massing close to the frontier with the
South amid mutterings about relations between the two states. Such military
demonstrations and veiled threats have become an annual event, but the balance
of probability remains that any sound and fury will be verbal only. Indeed, as
the North usually deploys up to 70% of its armed forces alo
Even during the nuclear dispute, when the North Koreans appeared to behave most
aggressively, the eventual consensus of opinion was that they were making a
plea for help. That may be the case again: the threat is a kind of blackmail
designed to elicit help in the most direct form of aid to compensate for the
failure of the Northern economy to deliver the sort of consumer products,
including food, which the South manages with ease. The logic of this situation
is the re-unification of the two Koreas, difficult though that will be for the
North's rulers to stomach. Much as German unification imposed a huge burden on
West Germany, a united Korea would be an enormous expense for the South. It is
well placed to bear it. The real trick will not be economic but diplomatic, as
the present situation shows.

THE lather that politicians have got into over HCI is extraordinary when the
cost is minuscule in comparison to Trident.
When the Israelis are prepared to contemplate giving up nuclear weapons it
makes British retention of Trident all the more difficult to justify.
HCI is an unfortunate episode. It should be remembered, however, that hospitals
are there to treat people. Nuclear weapons are weapons of mass destruction.
Billions have been squandered on Trident. The Public Accounts Committee should
take a look at the justification for such expense.

I DO NOT understand why the mark was not chosen as the name for the proposed
common currency. Would this not make economic sense as at least one country
would be saved the expense in any changeover?
It would also have been a nice gesture if perhaps war veterans were invited to
perform any naming ceremony. I am sure they would appreciate being involved in
some way and they may just forget why they made so many sacrifices protecting
the very freedom that some are so determined to give away.
So much is talked these days about the economical advantages to be gained by
further European integration (or should that read interference?) that the main
point is being overlooked.
This is one of principle, which should always take precedence over selling our
freedom for a quick buck. Principles are all too easily abandoned nowadays for
fear of being made to look stupid.
The lack of a ``feel-good factor'' may have something to do with the present
trend of bending over backwards to appease the French and Germans. In
surrendering our currency we are not simply giving our freedom away but are
paying an indecently large amount of money for the privilege.

PEOPLE drinking then driving on the treacherous icy roads in Scotland over the
three-day Christmas period have been strongly criticised by top police
officers, who said their actions ``bordered on lunacy''.
The comments from the Association of Chief Police Officers came as it was
revealed that the number of people who tested positively during this time had
fallen to 30 compared to 69 last year.
Seven people refused to take a test, compared with three people last year. In
Strathclyde 14 drivers tested positive. There were 24 last year.
The spokesman for ACPO said: ``Drink driving even in the best conditions is
dangerous, selfish, and irresponsible. To knowingly get behind the wheel in the
conditions we are experiencing at the moment and with too much alcohol in your
system is bordering on lunacy.''
The severe wintry weather meant a fall in the number of drivers breath tested
in Scotland over this Christmas period compared to 1994. Last year 2614 were
tested, with 1824 this year, a drop of around 30%.
Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton welcomed the fall but said
there was no room for complacency.
Lord James said: ``This was a difficult period for the emergency services and,
in many areas of the country, resources were used to their limits. This is
reflected in the fall in the number of breath tests carried out.
``The police will continue to operate a high level of testing and motorists
must realise there is a good chance that they will get caught if they choose to
drink and drive.''
He repeated the message that drinking and driving wrecked lives, and strongly
urged ``all motorists to heed the message and not to drink and drive over the
New Year holiday period''.
In Strathclyde, police stopped a total of 974 drivers for breath-testing, a
drop of 21%, with 1233 tested in the same period last year.
Snow and ice played a significant part in the decreased number of tests carried
out, with traffic lighter because of road conditions.

Russell Edmunds explains why the Government had little option but to pay legal
costs to relatives of the IRA members who died on the Rock
THE years pass but the controversy over the so-called ``Death on the Rock''
killings lingers on. Yesterday it took another turn as the Ministry of Defence
confirmed that it had paid nearly #40,000 in legal costs to the relatives of
the three IRA members shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar.
What happened on that Sunday afternoon in March 1988 has been the subject of
legal debate, newspaper investigation, television documentary, and political
argument.
At the heart of the matter lies one question: to stop a major IRA bomb outrage
in Gibraltar, was it really necessary to kill the terrorist team involved? That
issue has divided opinion in Northern Ireland and between the British and Irish
Governments. Few incidents in the entire Ulster troubles threatened to destroy
relations between London and Dublin as this one did and, to this day, the views
of the two Governments widely differ over the deaths on the Rock.
That Mairead Farrell, Sean Savage, and Daniel McCann were leading IRA
terrorists is not in dispute. They had carefully planned their operation over a
period of months but had been unaware that British intelligence, in
co-operation with other European undercover agents, was monitoring their
movements. Ironically, it is believed that Irish police played a significant
role, even though the Dublin Government expressed outrage at the SAS action in
killing the IRA trio.
The terrorists' target was a regiment of British soldiers based in Gibraltar. A
car bomb would detonate during the ceremonial parade outside or nearby the
Governor's house. The deaths and maimings of dozens of soldiers and bystanders
would be arguably the IRA's most spectacular outrage and a major morale-booster
for Irish republicans.
But on that Sunday afternoon, the whole plan collapsed as a unit of the SAS,
secretly flown into Gibraltar, confronted the IRA team and killed them all.
The deaths plunged Britain and its then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, into
international controversy as she characteristically and stalwartly applauded
the SAS action.
What is forgotten today is that the Gibraltar killings set off a chain reaction
of other horrendous events over that terrible week in 1988. At the subsequent
funerals in West Belfast's Milltown Cemetery, loyalist terrorist Michael Stone
fired shots and threw hand grenades at republican mourners who included the
entire hierarchy of Sinn Fein as well as many leading IRA activists. He killed
three mourners on St Patrick's Day, 1988, but two days later there was even
more horror. Two Army corporals were brutally hauled from their car, beaten and
shot dead by republican mourners attending the funeral of an IRA man who had
been one of Stone's victims in the cemetery attack.
Since then, interest and controversy over the Gibraltar killings has been
promoted by the relatives of those killed, in particular by the family of
Mairaed Farrell, whose brother Niall yesterday welcomed the payment of #38,700
legal costs by the British Government. He said bitterly: ``The Government is
facing up to the reality of the court's verdict and they are accepting it. If
they hadn't, they would have been ostracised as a terrorist state.''
The amount, however, seems trifling set against the years of political and
legal wrangling over the killings. For example, the inquests of Farrell,
Savage, and McCann ran for weeks in Gibraltar. A Belfast solicitor, Patrick
McGrory, devoted untold time to representing the families of those killed and,
indeed, the controversy outlived him as he died last year.
Even greater legal expense has been involved in taking the case into the
international arena, leading to a judgment last September by the European Court
of Human Rights. The sum of #38,700 pales against the overall costs involved in
obtaining a split decision from no fewer than 19 international judges.
What they concluded might be interpreted as a legal fudge. On the one hand they
held that Britain had not been involved in a shoot-to-kill policy; on the
other, that the SAS action in Gibraltar breached Article Two of the Human
Rights Convention. By a 10-9 majority, the judges held that the killings were
unlawful but rejected relatives' claims for compensation.
Unionist reaction yesterday in Northern Ireland to the news of the payout was
predictably hostile. Ulster Unionist security spokesman Ken Maginnis and the
Democratic Unionists, whose leader is the Rev Ian Paisley, were at one in their
condemnation.
The payment of costs was ``a Christmas present to the families of terrorists''.
They pointed to smaller amounts awarded to the families of terrorist victims,
such as Colin Parry, whose son was killed by the 1993 IRA bomb at Warrington.
Mr Parry received #7500 from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board and
yesterday the Unionists said they shared his view that ``no-one seems to make
the same strenuous effort on behalf of the victims as for the terrorists''.
The Unionists, like some Tory back-bench MPs, believe the Government has gone
back on its word.
They point to the anger expressed by Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine
when he described the September judgment as ``ludicrous'' and threatened to
withdraw from the European Convention.
Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East, said yesterday: ``I hope the utter
nonsense of this payout will make people think about the merits of having this
court at all.
``I am outraged that just before Christmas the British Government decided to
rejoin the court for another five years.''
However, behind the political fury in Ulster and Britain lies the reality,
unpalatable though it is to the critics, that the Government had little
alternative but to pay out. In the words of Sir Teddy Taylor: ``Many people who
find themselves short of money will be angry at these payouts but they could
not be avoided as Britain is a member of the European Court of Human Rights and
those who object have little ground for complaint.''
The arguments over the rights and wrongs of the Deaths on the Rock may never be
settled. As with so many aspects of the Ulster troubles, people seem to believe
what they want to believe. That means that most Unionists in Northern Ireland
consider the killings were wholly justified, while many nationalists contend
that the deaths could have been avoided and that undue force was used.
The judgment of the European Court was far from clear-cut and, #38,700
notwithstanding, still leaves the Gibraltar killings open to differing
interpretations in the history books of Northern Ireland's violent past.

A YOUNG mother has spoken of her family's most worrying Christmas ever after
her husband vanished during a night out with colleagues.
Leslie Armstrong, 36, a draughtsman, went out with workmates a week ago, and
has not been seen since he left a public house on Windmill Brae in Aberdeen at
6.30pm.
Police say they are baffled by the disappearance.
On Christmas Day Carol Armstrong, of Drumgelloch Street, Airdrie, told
eight-year-old Scott and Gillian, 10, that their father had had to stay on at
work.
She said: ``Now I am just praying Leslie will get in touch for Scott's birthday

THE power of the movie industry is selling Scotland across the world and
benefiting tourism to the tune of #10m, new figures reveal.
The success of films such as Braveheart and Rob Roy has attracted hundreds of
foreign travel journalists.
The Scottish Tourist Board said stories had appeared in travel magazines and
newspapers around the world and provided Scotland with around #10m worth of
editorial coverage.
More than 573 travel journalists visited Scotland over the summer in a
programme organised by the Scottish Tourist Board.
Now tourist chiefs hope that the next blockbuster out of Scotland, Loch Ness,
starring Ted Danson, which is premiered in Inverness in February, will provide
a similar lift.
Mr Graham Birse, director of public relations for the Scottish Tourist Board,
said: ``The boost to Scottish tourism provided by the recent kilt movies looks
set to continue next year.
``When you have a fairly limited marketing budget, the editorial generated by
these kinds of visits helps reinforce campaigns and, most importantly, has a
strong influence on the armchair traveller.''

A SHERIFF yesterday refused to show mercy to a heroin addict who robbed graves
to maintain his habit.
Thomas Cryans, 32, was given a maximum sentence of six months when he admitted
numerous thefts of flowers from six graves in Glasgow's Linn Cemetery over a
four-month period.
Mrs Gillian Mawdsley, prosecuting, told Glasgow Sheriff Court how police found
a cupboard full of artificial flowers in Cryans's home.
She said the value was not as substantial as the distress caused to relatives.
Last night it was revealed that Cryans sold stolen floral tributes and stone
angels at car boot sales and at Paddy's Market in Glasgow.
When he was arrested he told police it was easy money.
But behind him he left a trail of hurt for relatives who found the graves of
their loved ones desecrated.
Yesterday some of the relatives sat in court as defence solicitor Tom Fields
revealed that Cryans, of Ardencraig Road, Castlemilk, was a drug addict trying
to regain his health through treatment.
They shook their heads in anger as the lawyer appealed for him to be placed on
deferred sentence.
As Sheriff Kenneth Maciver pronounced sentence they thanked him for putting the
father of two behind bars.
One woman shouted to the sheriff: ``My wee wean will be at rest now he's off
the streets.''
The victims heard Sheriff Maciver tell Cryans that his crimes were examples of
the depths to which drug addicts stooped.
He said a jail sentence was required to express public revulsion and added:
``These crimes involved stealing items lovingly placed on the graves of the
deceased by relatives, and the effect on the relatives, is understood by not
only you but by the court.''
Outside the court, 27-year-old Mrs Karen Cairns, of Downcraig Road, Castlemilk,
described Cryans as ``scum and the lowest of the low''.
Cryans repeatedly stole flowers from the grave of Mrs Kairns's daughter Ashley,
who died in 1988 aged two.
She said: ``I'm glad he got a jail sentence, but even then six months isn't
long enough.
``I just hope he gets it in prison.
``When he was arrested police were investigating the thefts from 28 graves. He
was charged with 10 and when he finally appeared in court it was whittled down
to six.
``He told the police it was easy money and we heard later that he was selling
them in Paddy's Market.
``With flowers disappeared from Ashley's grave so often I used to sit up at
nights watching for the thief from my window, which overlooks the cemetery.
``I even put a note on a new batch of flowers saying they were put there for my
two-year-old daughter, but the next day the flowers were gone and the note was
all scrunched up at the graveside.
``Even since his arrest I've been checking on Ashley's grave - sometimes two or
three times a day, and I was there last night to make sure her flowers were
there.''
Wheelchair-bound Patricia Hanlon, 25, who was also in court, told how she
identified one of two stone angels stolen from the graveside of her
four-year-old son, Tony.
Ms Hanlon said: ``Cryans was never charged with the theft and we could never
understand why.''
Tony died in 1991 in a fire in his mother's home at Skerryvore Road, Cranhill.
Ms Hanlon, who was paralysed as a result of jumping from the blazing house,
said: ``We could never blank out little Tony's memory, and on his birthday and
at Christmas would buy him presents which were placed on his grave.
``Two stone angels and all his presents and flowers went missing. We were just
devastated.
``The police showed us an angel. It was definitely from Tony's grave because we
have photographs of it.
``We were told someone had bought it from a car boot sale.''

A THREAT to deport the Gambian son-in-law of Scottish folksinger Hamish Imlach
brought a last-minute reprieve by immigration officials yesterday, hours before
he was due to board a flight to Norway.
However, it emerged last night that the airline which allowed the
nursery-school teacher to enter the UK on Boxing Day without a visa is to be
fined several thousand pounds.
Yusupha (Jo) Bojanj arrived in Glasgow on Tuesday night on a SAS/British
Midland flight from Oslo via Copenhagen.
He had come to join his Scottish wife Mairead and three-year-old daughter Sira
who were already in Scotland for a month-long visit to relatives in Dennistoun,
Glasgow. The couple met four years ago and live in the Norwegian capital.
But Mr Bojanj, who has visited Scotland on several occasions, had arrived in
the UK without a visa unaware that British immigration regulations for Gambian
nationals had changed in October.
After being searched he was allowed to leave the airport on Tuesday night but
was instructed to return yesterday at lunchtime, two hours before the first
flight back to Norway.
After a distressing wait in the airport while immigration officials discussed
the case with the family's lawyer, Mr John Guthrie, Mr Bojanj was finally told
he could stay until January 1, the day he had originally planned to return home.
Mrs Bojanj, who is four months pregnant, said she and her husband were
delighted. ``My husband has been allowed to stay on compassionate grounds until
Monday. They seemed to think that Jo was coming here to get a job but that's
ridiculous, he has a job in a nursery.''
An immigration department official said she could not comment on individual
cases but said the Foreign Office had widely advertised the new visa
requirement for Gambian nationals.
``As of October a Gambian national required a visa to enter the UK. This can be
obtained from the British High Commission. If you require a visa you cannot get
round that point.''
She said airlines could also be fined if they failed to check that passengers
had the correct documentation. ``It's up to airlines to abide by UK immigration
law. Under the Carriers Liability Act airlines can be fined.''
Mr Imlach, speaking at home in Motherwell, said he was relieved at the
decision. ``My daughter was hysterical because they had already been unable to
spend Christmas together. But at least they can be together at Hogmanay. It is
really unbelievable. He has a home and a job in Norway and just came for a
holiday.''
Mr Bojanj, clearly distressed by the experience, said he had not been told he
needed a visa by SAS when he bought his ticket.
SAS manager Joergen Bounde, and a spokesman for British Midland which provides
the Glasgow to Copenhagen leg, both would not comment.

A BID to the National Millennium Fund, seeking #20m to provide a quality
tourist gateway to Loch Lomond at Balloch, has cleared its first hurdle.
Local MP John McFall, who heads the bid, will start talks with Dunbartonshire
Enterprise next week to flesh out the business plan behind the initiative.
``We are greatly buoyed by the early response from the Millenium Commission,''
he said yesterday.
``The majority of bids are rejected before they get past the initial stage. It
is very encouraging that we have received such a prompt response from the
commission inviting us to go on to the next stage which is submitting the
formal specification.''
He said the aim was to create something which would raise the tone of the whole
of the bottom end of Loch Lomond, and he was confident the Millennium
Commission looked upon it as an internationally important project.
The proposal would centre on Drumkinnon Bay.
It would include an exhibition and visitor centre with an open window on to the
loch concentrating on informing visitors about the loch environment; a visitor
management scheme linking this centre by foot and cycle bridge across the Leven
to Balloch Country Park; the restoration of the Maid of the Loch paddle
steamer; the restoration of the banks of Drumkinnon Bay; and a new planting and
conservation regime at Drumkinnon Wood.
Mr McFall estimates there could be a spin-off by as much as #42m in public and
private sector investment, and a #100m tourist boost leading to up to 4000 new
jobs.

IMMY Reid correctly suggests that covert racism is a deep-rooted problem in our
society which is extremely dangerous and difficult to tackle (Greatest dangers
that lurk just below the surface, December 23).
However, he makes a number of statements in relation to the recent Labour Party
selection contest in Govan which could fuel racial division although I am sure
that is not his intention.
He states that of the 52 votes cast which were ruled ineligible the majority
had been cast for Mohammed Sarwar. How could he make this assertion with such
certainty?
As a scrutineer at the count I do not know the identity of the 52 people whose
votes were ruled ineligible, so how does Jimmy Reid know who they are?
Jimmy Reid also states that Mike Watson is a Christian. This is not true. Mr
Watson is an atheist.
Jimmy Reid tells readers that ``all who had approached me on behalf of Mike
Watson . . . were white Christians, comfortably middle-class, university
graduates and with settled careers.''
This may well be the case but I would suggest that what this exposes is the
circles in which Jimmy Reid moves rather than the breadth of support which Mike
Watson had in the selection.
As his campaign manager I can assure Jimmy Reid that support was forthcoming
from bus drivers, shop workers, factory workers, building workers, shipyard
workers, unemployed workers, young people, not so young people, men, women, and
some Asian Scots too.
Jimmy Reid concludes by stating that part of his reaction to the selection in
Govan was one of shame. I too felt a deep sense of shame - shamed by those,
both Asian and white, who chose to play the race card in order to have the
result overturned.
This is a very dangerous tactic to use and I am very pleased that Mr Sarwar and
many of his colleagues have refrained from joining those involved. Jimmy Reid,
however unwittingly, has simply added fuel to the fire.

FORTE has tossed the ball back into Granada's court with its proposed #1050m
sale of its restaurant activities to Whitbread. Together with a forthcoming
revaluation of the hotels it will put pressure on Granada to raise its offer.
Granada will of course be able to attack both events. The price obtained from
Whitbread is not generous - how could it be when the vendor is in a desperate
battle to save its independence? And hotel values are notoriously difficult to
fix.
Reports suggest the hotels will be valued at over #3000m which would imply that
Granada's #3300m bid falls some #700m short. The hotels market is certainly
more active than it was during the days of Queens Moat when, if the valuations
were to be believed, its hotels almost halved in value in a matter of months.
So it should be possible to fix a value on lower and mid-market hotels with
reasonable accuracy, but it is particularly difficult to value ``trophy''
hotels when so few change hands. They make low returns but may well appeal as
billionaires' baubles.
Valuations can also be a two-edged sword as a high figure draws attention to
return on assets, which Granada will no doubt be keen to exploit. The group has
already fiercely criticised the plan to split Forte in two and there must
surely be something in what it says, namely that some economies of scale will
be lost.
Nevertheless, Granada's bid value has been weakened by the fall in its share
price and Forte's defence has been strong enough to make it look on the low
side. A modest increase in the terms - if Granada can afford it - will probably
be necessary for victory.
New age at GEC
LORD Weinstock's 32-year tenure at the helm of General Electric Company is
expected to come to an end this spring, at which time the company has announced
it will be naming a successor as managing director.
His achievement in building up the group into the powerhouse it now is,
straddling defence, power plant and telecommunications as well as more
peripheral activities, cannot be underestimated.
For a number of years, though, GEC appeared to have run out of steam and was
the subject of criticism, mostly centred on its enormous cash mountain. There
was the feeling that the group ought to be doing something with it, rather than
just sitting back and earning interest.
Lord Weinstock would no doubt argue that his more expansionist plans would be
turned down by the authorities. The recent successful acquisition of submarine
builder VSEL certainly spurred the share price which yesterday rose 8p to a new
high for the year, indeed of two years, of 351p. It compares with a low for the
year of 268p but GEC, anyway, has its attractions as an income stock.
Resolution of the somewhat controversial management succession issue would be
regarded as a major plus for the company, removing uncertainty. Chairman Lord
Prior is drawing up a short-list of potential candidates, including both
internal and external candidates.
GEC has already stated that that no announcement can be expected until the
spring. Analysts would expect a new broom to dispose of those group activities,
such as semiconductors, washing machines and cables, not covered by the three
core activities.
This would add to the already significant cash pile and increase the scope for
further expansion in its chosen fields. In the meantime, group orders remain
strong with potential fresh defence orders in the pipeline. The shares still
look attractive.
Welcome act
INCREASES made to pensions-in-payment from major occupational pension schemes
averaged 3.1% in 1995, according to Incomes Data Services which specialises on
employment issues.
The actual range was from zero to 5% which means that while many schemes made
sure their pensioners did not see the value of their pension eroded, or at
least provided some protection, there were still a few companies which do not
appear too much concerned about the plight of their pensioners.
However, in addition to general increases, some pension schemes did award
special ``catching up'' rises to older pensioners to help restore the
purchasing power of their pensions.
At present, company pension schemes are not obliged to increase pensions to
compensate for the effects of inflation though under the new Pensions Act,
limited price indexation safeguards will start to accrue from April 1997.
But IDS says that virtually no schemes outside the public sector guarantee full
inflation-proofing, the great majority of the company pension schemes analysed,
and which covered 70 ``blue chip'' schemes, guaranteed some increase, often
matching inflation up to 5% each year.
When Limited Price Indexation for pensions-in-payment comes into force,
companies will have to decide how to implement this. For example, they will
have to decide whether they will provide guaranteed increases, in line with
statutory requirements, or continue to apply a higher upper limit as is
currently the case with some schemes.
Either way, the Pensions Act is something to be welcomed. At age 60, the
average male in the UK can expect to live a further 16.4 years and the average
female, a further 20.9 years.
So even with a fairly low rate of yearly RPI increase, the considerable length
of time which a pension may be payable means that a fixed rate pension retains
little of its original purchasing power. Poverty is not funny, even less so in
old age.

THE article, Shotgun permits exceed 100,000 (December 27), made a number of
interesting points. The British Association for Shooting and Conservation is
obviously delighted that recent figures indicate a rise in the number of
certificates on issue for both shotguns and firearms in Scotland.
This follows a number of years of decline, primarly due to the ill-conceived
and un-necessary Firearms (Amendment) Act of 1988.
This period of decline in the number of people legitimately owning shotguns or
firearms coincided with the ongoing increase in the use of guns in crime.
Therefore, for Mr McFall to argue that the legitimate ownership of shotguns and
firearms is in any way linked to armed crime is ridiculous.
The lowest levels of armed crime in this country coincided with the highest
levels of legitimate firearms ownership. Numerous independent studies have
failed to establish any link between legitimate firearms ownership and armed
crime.
If Mr McFall is genuinely interested in reducing armed crime in Scotland, he
should look to the criminals rather than the law-abiding. Amendments to the
existing firearms legislation will only prove to be an inconvenience to
legitimate firearm and shotgun owners and a further bureaucratic burden to our
hard-pressed police.

THE millennium looms. With a little help from the lottery, all Britain is
preparing to celebrate the event with a series of prestigious projects for the
lasting benefit of the country. Which worthy candidates for millennial money
benefit and which do not is a lottery in itself, with the inscrutable
Millennium Commission in charge of the show. The #20m bid to provide a tourist
gateway to Loch Lomond has had an optimistic clearance of the first hurdle. The
most recent losing candidate, however, was Welsh National Opera, knocked back
in its campaign for a spectacular new home. For culture should we now read
horticulture? There is a distinctly green-fingered look about the last round of
favoured schemes, including a national wildflower centre on Merseyside, the
improvement of the famous Slimbridge wildfowl and wetlands site associated with
the name of Peter Scott, and the conservation of unique limestone cliffs in the
North-east of England. Green is good, according to the commissioners, who are
no doubt aware that wildlife and conservation projects are likely to be less
controversial issues in the media than the arts.
One of the Scottish initiatives already given preliminary backing is the
so-called Millennium Forest. So far only a relatively small sum has been
allocated to lay the groundwork for the project, but this implies a recognition
of the vision and a willingness to contribute further instalments as it begins
to take shape. The idea of restoring, at least to some extent, the old
Caledonian forest - which once covered much of Scotland but which latterly
faced extinction - has gained much popular support. One aspect of this is a
move among several communities to establish local woodlands for amenity,
pleasure, and recreation. In some cases the creation of employment in forestry
and woodcrafts forms part of the aim. It is a welcome sign. Government
agencies, conservation and wildlife bodies, local authorities, and a large
number of enthusiasts have expressed support. But there is no such thing as
instant woodland. In the life of a forest, four years is barely a start. Giving
back Scotland its native forest is a seductive ideal but it will not happen
today or tomorrow. It will take decades, even centuries, for the green mantle
to spread. That, surely, is the essence of a millennial project. It may be slow
to grow, but it will endure.

WHEN I heard Scotland had been drawn against England in next summer's European
Championships, I groaned, realising that the news would be like a blood
transfusion to one of the worst cliches in the language. And sure enough, there
it was in the headlines the next morning - even in The Herald: ``The Auld
Enemy''.
There was an episode of The Golden Girls when Blanche, exasperated by
Southerners dedicated to nostalgia for the Confederacy, snapped at them: ``You
lost the war - get over it.'' Faced with talk of the ``auld enemy'' I'm tempted
to parody her: ``You lost your independence - get over it.'' My problem is that
only half of me can use that word ``you'' while the other half takes great
offence. For while, as my surname makes apparent, on my father's side I'm
English, on my mother's side I'm Scots. I was born in England but grew up in
Scotland; I've spent much of my adult life in England, but now I live in
Scotland. Again if obliged to define my ethnic group, I have to say ``English
Scot''.
Now there's a phrase you don't often come across. It's so unusual it sounds
like a self contradiction. How can anyone be both English and Scottish? Yet
parallel descriptions don't seem at all odd, Italian Scot, Irish Scot, Jewish
Scot, all express recognised identities. No-one would feel obliged to apologise
for using them, or to explain what the phrase meant.
But English Scots are, in fact, the largest non-native minority in Scotland.
The last census showed that 350,000 residents of Scotland were born in England
- 7%, or one in 14, of the population. The only reason we don't actually appear
to be the largest minority is because of the tendency of Scots of Irish descent
to go on celebrating their Irish identity several generations after their
families migrated.
So here we are, well entrenched in Scottish life, many of us having ``gone
native'' in a big way, and then opening our papers to see ``auld enemy''
splashed all over them, and preparations being made to fight the battle of
Bannockburn for the umpteenth time. Before that fixture is played on June 15
next year I fear that a tidal wave of such nonsense will sweep through all the
Scottish media. Most of it will be harmless enough but if England should be
instrumental in putting Scotland out of the championships, the ugly side of
Scottish Anglophobia will undoubtedly surface.
Of course you hardly need a degree in political science to work out why the
phrase ``English Scot'' sounds peculiar. It's a matter of political reality
that England dominates Scotland to an outrageous extent, so much so that to the
outside world it seems to incorporate Scotland; it's an impossible battle to
get foreigners to stop using ``England'' when they mean Britain. The root cause
is that the population of England is nine times greater than that of Scotland.
The Union beween two parties so unequal in size is always going to be
one-sided. I have never found any concept among the English that the Scots are
an ``enemy'', but at the same time they can't help feeling that the United
Kingdom consists, by and large, of themselves plus some hangers-on.
Given this cultural background there is inevitably some tension in the
``English Scottish'' identity. Sooner or later you have to make some kind of
choice. Since the relationship between England and Scotland hinges on the fact
that one is a powerful country and the other isn't, you can't consistently
identify with both. After all, not even the most skilled madam in a brothel can
be both dominatrix and submissive simultaneously.
And as is well known, this political reality impinges on the role of English
people in Scotland. To some extent they are inevitably seen as representatives
of the larger country, enjoying a privileged position reflecting that of
England in the Union. A few years ago there was a nasty attempt to stir up
hysteria about ``the Englishing of Scotland'', and though it got nowhere it
none the less expressed an underlying anxiety. The opposite side of this
particular coin is that in some economic sectors English people make an
enormous contribution to Scottish life. For example, much of Glasgow's cultural
infrastructure would collapse tomorrow if all the English involved took the
advice of some graffiti artists and ``went home''.
Those of us who are half-Scots, half-English are caught in the middle of this
conflict of identities. In this article I've used the pronoun ``they'' to refer
equitably to both sides. Yet when I write for English papers I use ``we'' and
``us'' of the Scots without the least hesitation. Certainly, when I lived in
England as an adult I never thought of myself as anything but Scottish, not
only because I'd grown up here (I was three when my family moved north) but
because everyone treated me as such, reacting to my accent. After 16 years I
still had to put up with humorists who thought that to greet me with ``och aye
the noo'' was a devastatingly original gem of wit.
In politics I've become an increasingly convinced Scottish nationalist,
precisely because, as I stated in a previous article in The Herald, I of all
people know just how different Scotland and England are and have no illusions
about how imbalanced the Union is in England's favour. But I have to admit that
to some extent my Englishness contributes to my Scottish nationalism: to change
pronouns yet again, there's a part of me that thinks that once you've got your
independence again, you won't be able to go on moaning about the ``auld enemy''.

DOCTOR Dermot O'Brien, head of parasitology at the Veterinary Research
Laboratory in Dublin, has warned sheep farmers of the risk of using only one
injection to treat sheep scab.
Dr O'Brien said that only invermectin was licensed for the control of sheep
scab by injection and it should be administered in two doses - as defined in
the product licence - seven days apart.
Injecting should be a two-man job, he said. ``I have seen hundreds of farmers,
who say they have injected their sheep, who have injected the fleece instead.''

I READ with disbelief the letter from Mr William Scott on prisoners' rights
(December 18). He is one of an army of do-gooders who now prevail in our
society. He uses words like ``deserving utmost care, attention, help'' and
phrases like ``We must not fail Mrs West as we failed Fred West'', and ``We
have a duty to protect her''.
I cannot help wondering what world Mr Scott lives in. It certainly cannot be
the one where a fine decent head teacher is knifed trying to protect one of his
pupils, or the world where a man trying to protect his family and home gets his
head smashed in.
The law in our country is a farce. It is time the old men on the bench retired
and allowed younger judges who are aware of the evil around us to deal out
sentences to fit the crime.
Our concern should be for the victims not the criminals. Criminals have
choices, victims do not. Let's have harsher jails and a return to capital
punishment.
I believe jail should be hell, then perhaps those who prey on small children,
old people, and decent citizens would think twice about spending time there.
If those who push drugs were sentenced to a minimum of 20 years maybe our young
people would grow up in a safer world. Child molesters and murderers should be
executed or spend the rest of their life in jail.

HEARTS manager Jim Jefferies admitted last night that there is little hope of
his side's game against Celtic taking place at Tynecastle on Saturday.
The freeze is something which can surely sabotage Celtic's hopes of ending
Rangers' domination in the premier division but Jefferies has no answer to
offer for his club's problems.
He said: ``We will do everything possible to get the game on but, obviously,
the covers we have to protect the park are not going to be as effective as
undersoil heating.
``We will keep the covers on, but they are only going to help when the
temperature remains above minus four. Once they get into the figures we have
been suffering then there is nothing that we can do.
``I cannot see us getting the game on but we will be trying our best to have it
played.''
Celtic, meanwhile, can only wait and hope as the adverse weather conditions
could wreck their title ambitions.
If Rangers push still further ahead at the weekend then that would be bad
enough.
But if Celtic have to go into next Wednesday's Old Firm clash without Peter
Grant and John Hughes, because of suspension, and without having played a game
for 16 days then the dice would be loaded against them. It is not a scenario
manager Tommy Burns would want, nor should it.
The Scottish League will soon issue guidelines to premier division teams that
undersoil heating is essential. We cannot continue to have some teams
disadvantaged because some clubs have failed to realise that winter does hit
hard in this country.
Meanwhile, Hamilton and Partick Thistle were involved in talks yesterday to
ensure that the first division club's match at Firhill on Saturday will go
ahead.
Although Firhill has undersoil heating Partick's Boxing Day clash with
Hibernian was knocked out because of snow on the pitch.
Hamilton, who are ground-sharing at Firhill this season, are due to meet St
Mirren on Saturday and with recent good results, including Tuesday`s draw at
Dundee United, want the game to go ahead.
Hamilton secretary Scott Struthers said yesterday: ``We have spoken to Partick
officials this morning. The undersoil heating is on and will continue like that
during this cold spell.
``This will help Partick as well for they are at home to Falkirk next Monday
and want to ensure that match takes place.''
Almost all of the rest of the Scottish football card is set to be hit by
another winter white-out. Only matches at Ibrox, Tannadice, Hampden, and
Firhill, who all have undersoil heating, have a chance of going ahead.
A spokesman for Scotland Weather Watch last night confirmed the big freeze will
continue through the weekend.
He said: ``There is only an outside chance of temperatures improving by
Saturday and some areas seeing rain. It is far more likely that it will stay
below freezing, with sleet and snow showers.
``There is also a good chance of strong winds which would cause snowdrifts and
would close a lot of roads.''
This would mean travelling supporters would have difficulty making it to the
grounds, even if their game goes ahead.
Rangers' and Dundee United's fixtures were the only ones to survive the Boxing
Day weather. And once again, the majority of games will be called off this
weekend.
Here are the updated reports on the other premier division matches:
Kilmarnock v Aberdeen - Killie are set to use revolutionary measures in a bid
to save Saturday's match at Rugby Park from the big freeze.
The Ayrshire club are currently in discussion with several firms in an attempt
to lay their hands on protective covers for the pitch. And they are hoping to
have the covers in place, with hot air blowing underneath, to thaw the frozen
surface.
Club secretary Kevin Collins explained: ``We are making every effort to get the
park playable. There is a covering of snow on the pitch, but it's not too bad
and it's possible to push a pitchfork into the surface.
``Contact has been made with a few firms in an attempt to have the pitch
covered. No effort will be spared to save the match.''
Raith Rovers v Partick Thistle - It looks unlikely the pitch will recover in
time. General manager Billy McPhee said: ``At the moment, the pitch is totally
unplayable and it's not looking good.
``The groundstaff are working as hard as they can, but there is only so much
they can do. The referee decided on Saturday the ground was too dangerous in
places and it hasn't changed since then.''
Falkirk v Motherwell - Already looks a certain non-starter. Secretary George
Miller said: ``I would say at this stage there is no chance of the match going
ahead.
``The pitch is covered with snow and frost has made the surface brick hard
underneath. The forecast is for more severe frost and blizzards, so it's not
looking good.''
Rangers v Hibernian - Ibrox hosted the match against Kilmarnock and stood up to
the rigours of the 90 minutes. The pitch is okay for the visit of the Easter
Road outfit.
In the first division, Morton's match with Dunfermline is almost certainly off,
with several inches of snow lying on the Cappielow pitch.
Secretary Jane Rankin said: ``There is hard-packed ice on the park and it
doesn't augur well for Saturday. If the weather forecast is correct, there
isn't a chance of the game going ahead.''
St Johnstone will have a pitch inspection tomorrow, but the club are already
resigned to the fact that the match with Clydebank will be called off.

JOHN McFall's approach to becoming the party of law and order makes Michael
Howard's hare-brained schemes appear eminently sensible (December 27).
The assertion that shotguns should be subject to a firearm type controls to
reduce gun crime beggers belief.
If firearm certification reduces crime why did crimes involving handguns leap
by 47% last year, and how will increased controls on shotgun ownership cut
illegal handgun use?
I particularly liked his implication that an increase in the number of legally
owned guns is directly related to the prevalence of gun crime. It would have
been even better with some facts to back it up. Perhaps there are other reasons
for this increase, but let's not have logic intruding on a good political
argument.
The conclusion and proposed action prevent lawful citizens from owning a gun in
case we have a crime committed on us and our stolen guns are used in robberies.
I thought the fundamental principle of law and order was to protect the
innocent and punish the guilty. Even Michael Howard gets that one right now and
again.
I fully support any logical measures to reduce the use of firearms in crime but
let's not McFall down on this one again.
Mr McFall should remember to keep some principles in the rush for power.

THE Scottish meat industry working party which has been set up to provide a
co-ordinated response to the current BSE scare has reaffirmed its confidence in
the extended measures being taken to control and eradicate the disease.
In recognition of the heavy costs which have been incurred by the industry in
complying with requirements for the removal and disposal of specified bovine
offal (SBO) the working party is again considering an approach to the
Government for assistance in obtaining help from the European Community's
disease eradication veterinary fund.
The joint working party was set up by the Institute of Auctioneers and
Appraisers in Scotland and the Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers. It was
founded as a means of breaking the impasse over a call from the wholesalers for
a special levy to be imposed on cattle sold at auction, as a contribution
towards the additional costs being met by abattoirs.
All sectors of the industry are represented on the joint body including
producers, renderers and retailers as well as the auctioneers and the meat
wholesalers.
Mr Don Curry, chairman of the Meat and Livestock Commission, has been leading
the working group discussions and has agreed to explore the possibility of
setting up a UK-wide strategy group to harmonise regional and sector policies
and opinions.
Meanwhile Aberdeen-Angus producers have become the first in Scotland to give
buyers a guarantee that all cattle marketed under the Certified Aberdeen-Angus
beef label are from farms registered with the Scotch Quality Beef and Lamb
Association Farm Assurance scheme.
``All farmers involved in the production of beef for our Certified Scheme must
first have achieved the high welfare and husbandry status of SQBLA Farm
Assured,'' said Mr Jim Ironside, managing director of Aberdeen-Angus Producers
(Scotland) Ltd.
``We require 100% commitment from our 500 producers, whether they are pedigreee
breeders or beef finishers,'' he added.
``We are totally confident in our members' ability to manage livestock under
strict welfare conditions. Certified wholesalers and retailers will be expected
to achieve the same degree of excellence in their respective domains.''
Sales of Aberdeen-Angus beef are reported to holding up well during the present
crisis in the meat industry, because of the healthy, quality image of Angus
beef produced in specialist beef herds.
``Consumers have confidence in our product because of the disciplines we impose
to ensure that Certified Aberdeen-Angus beef meets the highest welfare and

THE killer of schoolgirl Mhairi Julyan is almost certainly a local person who
is being shielded by a friend or relative, the officer leading the murder
investigation said yesterday.
Detective Chief Inspector Bob Lauder was speaking on the eleventh day of the
hunt for Mhairi's killer.
The 16-year-old redhead had been making her way home from the pantomime
Sleeping Beauty at the town's Palace Theatre on Saturday, December 16, when she
disappeared.
Her body was discovered the following afternoon in the Stagecoach bus depot in
McKinlay Place, Kilmarnock. She had been the victim of what police have
described as a ``particularly savage and brutal attack''.
Mr Lauder said yesterday: ``I believe that this is a local crime and that
someone in the Kilmarnock area holds the key to this shocking murder.
``I cannot believe that any person could act normally when the enormity of what
they have done settles upon them and for that reason I repeat my appeal to
local people to consider carefully the behaviour of those close to them in
recent days.
``It may be a change in mood or habit but any little change may be significant
and I would stress that all information will be treated in confidence.''
Mr Lauder conceded that the inquiry was being frustrated by a lack of
information relating to the time between Mhairi's passing of the Jet filling
station in London Road on Saturday night and when her body was found.
He added: ``It may be that she walked on towards her home in Samson Avenue via
the usual route or she took another route or was even taken in a car. We just
don't know and we hope that anyone out there who does will get in touch with us.
``There may be people sitting at home who were in the area and who saw nothing
but I would still ask them to get in touch so that they may be eliminated from
the inquiry.''
Mr Lauder wants four teenage boys aged between 15 and 17 who were seen at the
Jet filling station ``in boisterous mood'' around 9.20pm on December 16 to
contact the incident room.
The four youths were of average height and build and wearing dark clothing. At
the earlier time two were sitting on the wall and two were on the pavement.
In addition the senior detective appealed for two middle-aged men, who may have
been ``bus spotters'' and who were seen in the Stagecoach depot around 11.10am
on December 17, to come forward as they may have information.

THE Nimmo-Smith report on Monklands at last clears the air and should put an
end to this whole absurd affair.
As a Labour Party member, I am pleased with the report's findings but puzzled
by the reaction of some of Labour's so-called Scottish leaders.
Mr George Robertson and Mrs Helen Liddell were less than enthusiastic in their
praise of the council, which was owed a huge apology from them and others.
It was Mr Robertson (soon to be the Secretary of State for Scotland?) who
welcomed the ``thoroughness'' of the now discredited Black report. This then
led to the suspension from holding office of Labour councillors in Monklands
and North Lanarkshire.
The fact that these councillors had massive support from their electorate after
Mrs Liddell had squeezed into a once solid Labour seat did not seem to matter.
In consequence people like me who voted Labour have been denied the full
representation which we had expected.
The message from the Nimmo-Smith report to John Smith House in London, which
they would be extremely foolish to ignore, is that they have already gone too
far. They should have supported the majority in the Labour group instead of
undermining them.
They should drop the hidden threat in Helen Liddell's remarks on this very
important report by restoring with full speed all rights to those who have been
democratically elected.
In addition, they should be grateful that one of the few politicians to have
come out of this period with any credit is Tom Clarke, now happily back in the
Shadow Cabinet.
Mr Clarke was steadfast throughout in his defence of decency and democracy even
in the face of attacks, many anonymous.
Tony Blair would do well to give more weight to his counsel and less to those
like Mr Robertson and Mrs Liddell who have been completely discredited by this
unnecessary saga.

WHAT a nation of cowards we have become. In former times we would respond to
threats or dangers, like Hitler's blitz, by summoning our resolve and showing
traditional British pluck.
Today half the country are too scared to eat a nice juicy steak because they
are terrified of catching Mad Cow disease. I have nothing but contempt for such
poltroons.
The prospect of one's brain turning to sponge and an agonising death is
certainly appalling and only a simpleton would believe the assurances of the
Government and their scientists (many of them obviously with vested interests
in the meat industry).
But surely, the courageous thing to do is to face the danger squarely and
refuse to be deflected from one's course?
The people of this country must realise that they can't go on running forever.
We must resist the slide into the moral weakness of vegetarianism.

AN opencast mining company has begun legal action against the Scottish Coal
Company over a contract drawn up with British Coal when the industry was
privatised.
SB Minerals of Uddingston, Lanarkshire, a subsidiary of Law Holdings, lodged a
summons in the Court of Session on Friday. The company is seeking a #4.2m in
compensation after the final amount of coal mined fell short of that indicated
by British Coal when private companies were invited to bid for the mine.
The company, which employs 300 people, believes Scottish Coal - which is owned
by Mining Scotland - took over all liability from British Coal last year.
Yesterday a spokesman for Law Holdings said when mining finished at the
Piperhill opencast mine in Ayrshire this September only 850,000 tonnes had been
mined instead of the expected 950,000.
``British Coal had put the mine up for tender on the basis that there was
950,000 tonnes of coal on the site. Scottish Coal has refused to agree to
compensation.''
Last night Scottish Coal's company secretary, Mr Martin Reeves, would only
confirm that the action had been lodged with the Court of Session.

OF all Scotland's 684 registered opthalmic opticians C Jeffrey Black's Sports
Vision Clinic in Glasgow occupies a unique niche.
Its branch in Hope Street, Glasgow is equipped with state-of-the-art technology
for administering 14 separate eye checks to sportsmen and women.
Established in Shettleston by Oscar Black in 1941, the company is now headed by
the founder's son Colin. There are 15 branches north of the Border, all except
three in the West of Scotland.
Visual fitness is the buzz word in sports optometry, one of the new sports
sciences. Soft contact lenses, the most commonly supplied aid for sports people
because of comfort and good peripheral vision, were prescribed at Hope Street
for 15% of the Scottish Commonwealth Games team; and already a number of
participants in the next Olympics have applied to the Glasgow clinic, one of
only three UK centres for Olympic vision testing.
They are assessed on such skills as contrast sensitivity, colour vision,
alignment, hand/eye/foot reaction times, and visual concentration.
Clients are advised by optometrist Peter Ivins a founding member of the UK
Sports Vision Association. The idea of setting up #35,000 worth of sports
vision equipment in Hope Street was his.
In 1989, Mr Ivins attended a symposium on contact lenses in Lillehammer, little
realising he'd be back there as sports vision consultant for the 1994 Winter
Olympics.
``One of the speakers, an associate professor of optometry at Pacific State
University, gave a half-day lecture on sports vision. It was my first contact
with the subject. We corresponded, I helped him at the Barcelona Olympics, then
I decided we should do something similar in Scotland.''
Coinciding fortuitously with the launch of C Jeffrey Black's #60,000
sponsorship towards assessing the visual fitness of the Scottish Commonwealth
Games squad, the sports vision branch was opened in early 1993.
Elite sportsmen and women are well aware of this provision. Just before
Christmas, Mr Ivins was invited by multi-national visioncare company, Bausch
and Lomb, to screen the English rugby team, and he has advised some English
clay pigeon shooters.
However, sports-loving members of the public come to Hope Street too for
spectacles specifically designed for skiers, orienteers, divers and snooker
players. Custom-made sunglasses are another feature.
Specialist eyeware accounts for some 6-7% of C Jeffrey Black's business with
contact lenses at 15%.
But it is in the realm of sports vision that C Jeffrey Black has established a
unique foothold north of the Border, one which works equally to the advantage
of sport and to the company itself.
The decision to specialise in this fast-growing area made sound commercial
sense. ``We're seen to be at the leading edge of the profession.
``It gives us access to top sports people who, in turn, help us compile
statistics about visual skills,'' said Mr Ivins, whose aim is for the public to
appreciate how even minor visual correction can enhance a sporting performance.

CELTIC have added a new dimension to their burgeoning youth policy by inviting
Ajax coach Heini Otto to help train some of their starlets.
Otto was in Scotland yesterday and assisted the Parkhead managerial team of
Tommy Burns and Billy Stark in coaching youngsters between the ages of eight
and 14.
Otto coaches Louis van Gaal's youthful Ajax team which captured the European
Cup last season, and who have gone 52 Dutch league games without defeat.
Their side includes brilliant striker Patrick Kluivert, who scored the winner
against AC Milan in Vienna and both goals that ended the Republic of Ireland's
hopes of qualifying for the European Championship finals in the Anfield
play-off against Holland a fortnight ago.
Burns, who went to Amsterdam to visit Ajax earlier this year, has already
drafted several promising youngsters into his own first team as well as
producing a conveyor belt of young talent which will, hopefully, work up
through the ranks.
q HIBERNIAN'S undersoil heating yesterday enabled their Premier Reserve League
match against Partick Thistle to go ahead at Easter Road.
The match finished 1-1 with Hibs' manager Alex Miller's two sons both involved.
Graeme scored Hibs' equaliser and Greg missed a penalty. Partick's scorer was
25-year-old Scots-born trialist Steve McMahon, who has been training with
Partick for the last month after playing in China.
q STEVE Campbell, the former Dundee defender, is looking for a club in Scotland
after winning a four-month fight for a free transfer.
The former Dens Park left-back found himself frozen out when Irish club
Coleraine appointed Kenny Shiels as their manager last summer.
The new manager decided to stop flying the club's Scottish players over for
matches - there were six on the books when he took over - and promptly released
every one of them, apart from Campbell.
Steve said last night: ``I had a year of my contract to go and the board didn't
want to free me, even though I had cost them nothing when I first joined them.
They did let me go to Dundalk for three games, but my chance of a permanent
move there folded when Coleraine demanded a fee.
``I haven't been playing anywhere recently, but I have now managed to sort
things out with the board at Coleraine.''

A TEENAGER freezes to death by the roadside in the middle of the night. Rivers
ice over. Pipes burst. Points seize. Roads close. Airports shut. Cars won't
start. Power lines sag under the weight of snow and ice, and snap. For days
communities are cut off from heat and light, the very sustenance whose sudden
and utter lack they most keenly feel at a time of sustained, extreme, numbing
cold. Blankets and candles are no answer. The elderly, the infirm, and the
homeless are at great risk. A state of emergency is declared in our most
northerly isles. From Shetland to the Borders record sub-zero temperatures are
logged, reported, talked about, endured. Is there no end to it? Yes, there is,
say the weathermen, but it won't come for a while yet. It will be little
consolation, as we shiver and shudder, to learn that the mercury is not
expected to rise - and with it a sense of relief - until next week. But on the
basis of their recent predictions we can at least trust the weathermen. They
did, after all, give us warning that we were about to be seized by the iciest
of grips.
Is it simplistic, then, to ask if Hydro-Electric, ScotRail, Railtrack, and the
road-maintaining local authorities were caught cold? The Western Isles Labour
MP Calum MacDonald is right to ask if the privatised power company for the
North and Western Isles could have been better prepared for the storms, which
had of course been predicted. There have been too many instances in the past of
manpower - and safety - being compromised by the primacy of privatisation.
Hydro-Electric's customers deserve answers, and at the very least public
confirmation that their needs at such times are paramount. For those linesmen
and other emergency workers who have laboured tirelessly for their fellow
citizens in the most inhospitable of conditions we have nothing but praise. But
as we wait on icy platforms and in slippery traffic jams we seem resigned to
life in the age of bottom-line accounting, when committing cash to dealing
with, and keeping it ready for, extreme weather is not an option.
That does not mean complacency, and in this regard the Government should be
flexible with its cold-weather payments to take account of such extraordinarily
inclement times. The needy deserve it.

IT pains me to have to disagree with one sentence in an excellent essay,
Greatest dangers that lurk just below the surface (December 23) by Jimmy Reid.
He is historically incorrect when he says ``the British Empire pioneered the
concept of the concentration camp in Southern Africa''.
That dubious privilege belongs to the United States. In the freezing winter of
1863 the celebrated, but truly infamous, Kit Carson, rounded up the entire
Navajo tribe, 9000 strong, massacring all who resisted and destroying their
crops, orchards, livestock, and homes, and marched them 300 miles to Bosque
Redondo, or Fort Sumner, in New Mexico.
All who could not keep up in the snow and the cold were shot.
There they were kept for four years in what General Sherman called ``a howling
desert'', many hundreds more of them dying because of the bad water and food.
No Navajo has ever forgotten that tragic episode in their history: it is their
equivalent of the Clearances.

SCOTLAND'S regional leagues seem doomed to inconclusion as the result of a
mounting backlog of postponed matches. In a statement issued yesterday from
Murrayfield, Gregor Nicholson, the SRU championship secretary, said: ``In view
of the number of SRU Tennent's regional league fixtures which have been
postponed to date, it will not be possible to conclude the regional leagues
prior to the scheduled date for the third round of the SRU Tennent's 1556 Cup
on February 24.''
The regional leagues were introduced to provide a post-championship competition
for the 32 clubs in the four divisions of the Tennent's Premiership. In order
to give the regional leagues some competitive significance it was decided that
the top four finishers in each of the four groups would gain a bye directly
into the fourth round of the cup while those finishing in the lower four would
be required to come into the competition at an earlier round.
For most top clubs the regional leagues have provided opportunities to look at
second XV players while their star performers have been on duty with district
sides. All the same, there is a detectable feeling that the first division
sides went into the regional leagues with the intention of upholding their
current status.
Cynics, however, have suggested that it might be in the interests of, say, a
club like Watsonians to finish in the bottom four, thus enabling them to enter
the cup in the third round and, in so doing, attract a larger crowd for what
would be a meaningful game.
Now that the regional leagues can no longer determine at what round clubs enter
the cup, the SRU have come up with a solution that maybe should have been
implemented in the first place.
It is thus. The names of the 32 regional league clubs will be put into a hat;
the first 16 drawn will receive byes into the fourth round of the cup; the
remainder go in the hat will join the 16 winners (national league clubs) of the
second round for the third-round draw.
So, what does this all add up to?
What it means is that first division clubs are just as likely as lower-placed
clubs in the Premiership to find themselves in the third round of the cup.
Furthermore, since the third-round draw is unseeded there is a chance that, for
example, Melrose and Stirling could meet.
The possibility of division one clubs playing important cup games could present
personnel problems for the top sides given that international players may be
reluctant, or even contractually prevented, from taking part in cup matches at
the end of February.

Kirsty Scott visits the incident room in Kilmarnock where detectives hunting
for the killer of Mhairi Julyan are using traditional techniques with hi-tech
help
IN THIS sterile world of screens and printouts the technology knows Mhairi
Julyan simply and bluntly as N1, but the men and women who work here know her
as the bright 16-year-old whose life was ended brutally and whose killer they
are determined to catch.
There are few visible signs of Mhairi in the incident room set up on the first
floor of the police headquarters in Kilmarnock, but her presence is everywhere;
her name written neatly on a board, a map showing her house and the bus depot
where her body was found, her name and reference number flashing up on every
computer screen, her diary scrutinised and analysed, possible sightings of her
scribbled on written statements, her image and the crime scene photographs in
the minds of all those who move through here.
``You don't forget,'' says Inspector Jim Russell with a grim smile. He is the
man responsible for co-ordinating the incident room and the information which
flows into it, and he has seen few crimes as distressing as this. ``I was in
CID for 17 years, and there's still a pride in locking up the bad guy,'' he
says. ``Everybody is working for the same end. We have a really brutal crime
here and you have to do your best. It means long hours, long travelling, but
it's got to be done. We have to get a result. Everybody knows a young girl's
life was taken, and that's the key.''
The crime scene photographs are not pinned to a wall, but kept in a book which
is shown, along with a video of the scene where Mhairi's body was recovered, to
any new officer joining the team. At the moment there are 60 detectives working
in the field and a further 12 sat at terminals, filing information into Holmes,
the police computer system. Many of them have been drafted in from divisions
across Strathclyde.
The main incident room has been split into two: street-pounding, door-knocking
detectives at one end, and the Holmes section, where Inspector Russell lives,
at the other. ``Lives'' is an apt word. Drafted in from `B' Division in
Partick, he drives for more than an hour to get into the office for 7am, and
there will still be people who have been in for more than an hour before that.
They worked right through Christmas and will be at their desks if need be as we
slip into the New Year.
There is never a moment of peace. If the incident room hotline isn't ringing,
then the printer is churning out screeds of paper or a detective is pulling on
his coat and bolting out of the door. In a large draughty hall down the
corridor which doubles as a briefing room, lists of names, maps and strategies
are pinned along the walls. In a separate small room marked ``Statement
Reader'' one man sits at a desk, eyes diligently criss-crossing the top sheet
of a pile of papers. There is plenty of talk, but precious little laughter.
At his desk in the corner, Jim Russell taps a few keys and Holmes's
bright-green screen flashes into action. ``Murder-Julyan'' it says in the
bottom right-hand corner. Russell calls it a great big filing system, but it is
part of the team and a crucial tool for drawing together the threads and
snippets of information which have flooded in since the news broke about
Mhairi's murder.
``If you look here,'' he says. ``Here's one individual; there were three
sightings on that night.''
He taps a few more keys. ``Say we wanted to look for how many times the word
`mark' comes up, whether for a mark on a face or maybe someone's name.'' A few
seconds later the screen flashes up a list of references. Someone who had a
visible scratch, people called Mark. The police have spoken to 2000 people and
calls are still coming in from the public.
Jim Russell has been amazed by the public response. ``The volume of calls has
been staggering,'' he says. ``We had more than 500 messages initially but the
calls have tailed off a little since Christmas Day. But up until Christmas Eve
the phone didn't stop ringing. It would start at 7am and go on until all hours
of the night. There's a bit of a joke here that there are maybe five people in
Kilmarnock who haven't phoned, and we want to know why.''
The sightings and information phoned in are each turned into a TIE (trace,
interview, eliminate) - task for the detectives, which may produce statements
which are fed into the computer, and so it goes. The police have been able to
eliminate a lot of irrelevant information this way, such as the group of
revellers who got into a fight the night of the killing and who prompted a slew
of calls to the incident room. The system has also brought them promising
nuggets of information like the latest sighting of a young man and a young
girl, who looked like Mhairi, arguing outside a hotel on London Road.
Russell hopes that the calls will keep coming because, he says, it won't be
Holmes that tracks down Mhairi's killer, but it will be that one crucial piece
of information. The one that will make the whole picture fall into place and
take Mhairi's name down off the walls.
``The smallest bit of information can be relevant. You just don't know. All it
may take is for someone to say `Hold on a minute, what was that about'. Just
one wee bit of information could be enough.''

q THE British Horseracing Board yesterday moved to guarantee racecourse action
in Britain this Saturday by sanctioning an extra all-weather fixture at
Wolverhampton this weekend.
With snow and frost having already produced three successive blank days for the
sport and tomorrow's fixtures also under threat, race planners reacted by
ensuring at least some British racing during betting shop hours.
The Midlands track is already hosting an evening meeting on Saturday but will
now stage a ``double-header'' with a six-race card beginning at 12.55 and
ending at 3.25 before racing resumes under floodlights from 7.0 until 9.30.

AS Rangers attempt to extend their lead in the premier division over closest
rivals Celtic this weekend, they have been boosted by the news that Gremio's
Brazilian striker Jardel will be at Ibrox within a fortnight.
Former England manager Bobby Robson, who is now in charge of Porto in Portugal,
has admitted that Walter Smith has beaten him to land one of Brazil's biggest
current stars.
The other week at Wembley, where England played Portugal, Robson met Smith and
told him: ``You have a winner. I have had my man in Brazil tracking Jardel for
three months and then you turn up and get him.
``We wanted him at Porto. We watched him so often and I tried to get my man to
have him fixed up, then you appeared on the scene and we lost him. He will be a
sensation in Scotland.''
Smith jetted to Brazil to arrange the transfer and now he awaits the arrival of
the striker who has been honeymooning with his beauty queen wife.
Jardel has to fulfil nationality requirements and that appears to be no problem
as far as Brazilian players are concerned. They are granted automatic
Portuguese passports and that has been the situation which has allowed so many
of the top clubs in Portugal to play ``foreign'' players in the European
tournaments.
Jardel will be available to boost Rangers as they push towards an eighth league
title victory. He will allow them another option up front and, according to
Robson, he will fit in superbly to the British game.
The Porto coach said: ``Jardel is the kind of player who will not need any
great time to adapt to the British style. He is someone who will go there and
make an immediate impact.''
Meanwhile, Rangers expect Oleg Salenko to be fit to face Hibs this weekend and
Gordon Durie, while doubtful to face his old club, will be ready for the Old
Firm clash next Wednesday.
Stuart McCall and Ally McCoist both are doubtful for that match.
q LIBERIAN striker George Weah is dedicating his Golden Ball award to the peace
process in his home country. The annual award, organised by the magazine France
Football, is one of the most highly regarded individual accolades in Europe.
AC Milan's Weah receives the honour in the first year it has been open to
non-European players and the 29-year-old striker is hopeful that his success
will serve as an example to his young countrymen.
``I'd like to give them a model for a better future than picking up a gun to
fight your own brothers for power,'' he said.
``I'd like to offer the Golden Ball award to all the rival forces who have been
fighting each other for six years in a war that has destroyed the country.
``This trophy could help to unite the different factions, foster peace, and
promote unity for my people.''

YOUR editorial on the Russian elections states that the Government's reforms
are working (December 19). Working for whom, it must be asked.
Gorbachev Fund analyst Viktor Kuvaldin has said that ``over 70% of people have
lost ground and are living worse than a few years ago''.
The result of this can be seen in only one in 10 voting for Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin's Our Home Is Russia party, and a virtual doubling of the
Communist Party's vote compared to 1993.
While the mass of people struggle to make ends meet a small minority of
get-rich-quick merchants have plundered the wealth of the country through
privatisation and other forms of theft and are living in the lap of luxury.
Heavily armed gangsters carve up the cities into their own fiefdoms.
It is not a mass attack of nostalgia that is causing so many Russians to vote
communist but a recognition that the market economy does not work for the
majority.
You may advocate a jog rather than a sprint to market reforms but the result is
the same - misery for the masses. Only socialism provides an answer for them.

A RESPITE from blizzard conditions gave farmers in Shetland an opportunity to
carry out checks on their livestock yesterday. With more bad weather forecast,
however, the Scottish Office is standing by to respond to any requests for help.
The National Farmers' Union of Scotland has said that an appeal had been issued
on the radio for Shetland farmers in difficulty to contact their NFUS
president, Addie Doull. So far, response has been muted.
Mr Doull has been told by members that they were running out of feed and fear
supplies would be finished by the weekend.
``The problem is one of distribution, said Mr Doull. With the roads blocked the
difficulty is getting out to the farms.''
A Scottish office spokeswoman in Edinburgh said that there were emergency plans
for airlifts in such situations however, there had been no request for that
kind of assistance to date.

THE latest effort to attract more tourists is to feature snails.
The French delicacy will be among a range of dishes going on show in London to
highlight Scotland's larder and reinforce links between tourism and the food
and drink industry.
It is part of a plan to offer top quality food to visitors at the London Boat
Show as part of a drive by Argyll and the Islands Enterprise to promote the
wealth of fresh produce available from Scotland's west coast.
Top Argyll chefs will be preparing a range dishes utilising local products,
including oysters, venison, scallops, and produce from the country's only snail
farm in Taynuilt.
AIE is staging up to seven cookery demonstrations a day at the 10-day show,
which opens on January 5 and is expected to attract more than 150,000 people.
Recipe cards have also been prepared and will be handed out to visitors to the
AIE stand, titled Argyll and the Islands - A Feast of Nature. As well as the
demonstrations, Loch Fyne Oysters is setting up a full oyster bar to tempt
visitors.
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth will be visiting the stand on January 11 and
food writer Henrietta Green will be there to promote her new book, called The
Food Lover's Guide to Britain.
Earlier this year, she was invited by to visit Argyll and the islands and, as a
result, 30 local companies have been featured.
AIE chief executive Ken Abernethy said: ``We were first at the Boat Show in
1993 when our Sail Scotland initiative was unveiled to the public. It was a
tremendous success and we are seeing increasing numbers of people visiting the
area as a result of that and the ongoing efforts of the partners in Sail
Scotland.
``The Boat Show is an ideal opportunity to reach a huge number of potential
visitors and show them exactly why Argyll and the islands is a great place to
come.''

A ROADSIDE search for missing 19-year-old French student Celine Figard was
called off last night, hours after her father appealed for help in tracing his
daughter.
Mr Bernard Figard, in his emotional appeal, said: ``Celine, if you can hear us,
if you can see us, please show yourself. Your family and friends are waiting.''
The 44-year-old farmer has travelled from his home in the village of
Ferrieres-Les-Scey, about 300 miles south-east of Paris, to help the police
with their search.
Police fear she was abducted after being given a lift by a lorry driver eight
days ago at a Granada service area.
By the time darkness fell, police had found no trace of Miss Figard, an
accountancy student.
The search, using 100 officers from three forces, a helicopter and a plane,
concentrated on roads leading from Newbury to Salisbury in Wiltshire, and will
resume at daylight today.
She had been picked up at the junction of the A34 and the M4 at Chieveley, near
Newbury, Berkshire.
The lorry driver who gave Miss Figard a lift said he would take her to
Salisbury, from where she intended to get a bus to Fordingbridge, Hampshire, to
spend Christmas with her cousin, who works as a head waiter at a hotel there.
Detective Superintendent Des Thomas, who is leading the hunt, said: ``I had the
unfortunate task of telling her father I am somewhat pessimistic about the
outcome of this.
``We all hope and pray we will find Celine alive. It will be the best thing
that could happen, but experience has shown that is not necessarily the case
after this amount of time.''
Despite extensive publicity and appeals, there has been no trace of the lorry
driver who picked the teenager up at Chieveley. Police say they are worried he
has not contacted them, and he holds the key to the mystery.
As detectives followed up numerous calls from the public, Mr Thomas said: ``I
have no doubt at all we will find this lorry driver. My great concern is we
will not find him in time to recover Celine.''
Mr Figard, who described his daughter as a timid but happy person, appealed to
the British public: ``Please keep helping us. We need to find Celine.''
He said his daughter, who does not have a boyfriend, had no reason to run away.
Police are now treating her disappearance as if it were a murder inquiry,
although they say that does not mean the student is dead.
The service area is at the centre of a road network, and Mr Thomas said: ``It
is the worst possible venue for a girl to go missing.''
After hearing Mr Figard's appeal, the detective said: ``There can be few
fathers out there who don't appreciate what he is going through at the moment.
You have to be a very cold-hearted person not to have some sympathy with a man
who has lost his daughter days before Christmas.''
The student had been given a lift to Folkestone by a French lorry driver, a
friend of her family, who placed her in the care of another French driver, who
took her to the Chieveley service area.
She tried to ring her cousin at Fordingbridge from the service station, but was
unable to get through and an English lorry driver said she could use the
telephone in his cab and he would take her to Salisbury. But no call was
received by her cousin and she vanished.
Police say she got into a white Mercedes cab, which was pulling a grey trailer
with a refrigeration unit. The driver, white and aged between 30 and 35 years,
has short fair hair and a short cropped ``chin strap'' beard, but no moustache.
Mr Thomas ruled out any connection between Miss Figard's disappearance and the
murder of Finnish student Eila Karjalainen, who went missing near Woodstock,
Oxfordshire, in 1983. Her body was recovered nearby four months later.

<HEADLINE>Water from the tap is improving, says official review body</HEADLINE>

DRINKING water in Scotland's homes is continuing to improve in quality,
according to a report published by the Scottish Office yesterday.
The Engineering, Water, and Waste Directorate report for 1994 said that the
water authorities in the nine regional and three islands councils were
maintaining progress and continuing improvements in water quality.
From more than 240,000 tests carried out on tap samples, 98.7% met the required
standards, compared with 98.6% in 1993.
Where tap water did not meet the required standards, there was no risk to
public health, and the authorities took action to remedy the fault. During
1994, 37 incidents were reported and in every case the authority took
appropriate action.
There were 34 incidents which involved the failure, or risk of failure, to meet
microbiological standards.
In all of these, the water authorities advised consumers to boil water for
drinking or cooking. The total population affected by coliform-contaminated
water was 87,990.
One incident in East Lothian affected 70,000 people. The other 33 were
generally small and affected a few hundred people.
Twenty-four of the incidents were related to chlorination-plant failure and
eight were caused by contamination at service reservoirs.
The report says the directorate monitored all incidents carefully as they
progressed, and decided there was a need to intervene in only one, the East
Lothian incident.
In this, samples indicated that water from Whittinghame and Castle Moffat
filter stations was contaminated. A warning to boil water was issued.
The cause of the incident was not established, but the directorate learned a
number of lessons in handling a large-scale occurrence.
The type of incidents varied across Scotland. This was largely a product of
local circumstances. At present, water quality standards, particularly for
microbiological parameters, varied widely in different water authority areas.
Thus failures which occurred routinely in remote rural locations were regarded
as very serious incidents in larger centres of population.
In a review of public exposure to lead in drinking water, the report said
action by authorities had reduced the previously high levels in water supplies.
A strict enforcement regime was now in place to identify breaches of the
regulations on concentration of lead in drinking water.
It was recommended that any revisions of the statutory standard for lead in
drinking water should be consistent with the scientific basis of the current
World Health Organisation guidelines.

<HEADLINE>Navy seeks torpedo to cripple but not kill</HEADLINE>

THE Royal Navy is seeking a new, lightweight torpedo which would disable rather
than sink ships by targeting their rudders instead of blasting holes in their
hulls.
The need for a small warhead was highlighted during the arms embargo and
sanctions patrols in the Adriatic during the Bosnian conflict. Royal Navy
submarines were able to spot potential blockade-runners, but were unable to do
anything more effective than radio their positions to the nearest allied
surface warships.
The Tigerfish and Spearfish torpedoes carried by all RN submarines were
designed for all-out war and packed with enough high explosive to rupture the
double hulls of deep-diving Soviet missile submarines.
It was calculated that a disabling shot would still leave the Soviet boats free
to launch their nuclear missiles, so the tinfish had to have sufficient punch
to ensure a first-time kill.
A senior naval source said yesterday: ``We need to be able to stop ships
without sending them to the bottom. There is nothing like a gaping hole in the
side or a broken back to finalise a submarine versus surface ship encounter in
wartime, but it is overkill on peacekeeping operations.
``What we need is a weapon which would home in on a blockade-runner's rudder
and screws and leave her dead in the water for the attentions of a boarding
party.''

Scots pioneered the technology and techniques for one of the most amazing
pieces of medical equipment in hospitals today. Yet, as Jackie Kemp discovers,
lack of insight and investment meant that their innovation was ignored here and
taken over by other countries
IT'S the first picture in junior's photograph album - a grainy black and white
shot of something that looks a lot like a space monster and a little like a
human baby. Almost all pregnant women undergo the ultrasound test that produces
a picture like this at least once.
Recently there has been concern that the method may be overused. The World
Health Organisation cautions against routinely exposing pregnant women to it
and warns it may be more sensible to use it only when necessary.
Despite these doubts, there is no denying that it has helped to revolutionise
the diagnosis of abnormalities in pregnancy.
Early scans can show up twins or triplets and can sometimes spot foetuses which
are not growing properly. Ultrasound pictures allow amniocentesis tests for
Down's syndrome and spina bifida to be carried out more safely.
Most antenatal clinics are bristling with ultrasound machines. In the Queen
Mother's Hospital in Glasgow alone there are around a dozen of them. A close
observer would discover that the majority are marked with the word Toshiba, for
the Japanese electronics firm are one of the world's leading manufacturers of
ultrasound machines.
However, medical ultrasound as we know it started in Glasgow. Belatedly the
Wellcome Trust is funding a research project into the history of this
remarkable discovery and Glasgow University is collating material for a book
and an archive.
And yet Glaswegian Tom Brown - the man whose name is listed on the early
worldwide patents as the sole inventor of the first commercial ultrasound
machine - sits sadly in his Wimbledon flat flicking through a scrap book of
memories. His eyes fill with tears as he recalls how the hope and promise of
the early days led to disappointment and financial ruin.
Back in the 50s, Brown was a young engineer at Kelvin Hughes in Hillington
working on industrial ultrasound, a modification of the sonar technique used in
the Second World War which on a smaller scale could detect flaws in metal
objects.
At that time there were only two places in the world where people were working
on the potential of medical ultrasound.
One was Denver, Colorado, and the other was Glasgow University. In Denver, a
man named Douglas Howry had modified a B 52 gun turret and was using low-energy
sonar to get pictures of patients' innards. The one drawback of his method was
that they had to be suspended naked in a tank of water while the terrifying
machine revolved around them. Although it produced high-quality pictures, its
obvious disadvantages for the treatment of the sick meant it never caught on.
But at the same time, Glasgow University's Professor of Midwifery, Ian Donald,
had become interested in the subject. He had gotten hold of an industrial flaw
detector and was doing his best to adapt it to allow him to distinguish between
fluid-filled cysts and cancerous tumours.
Howry was immersing his patients in water in the US because ultrasound waves
don't travel so well through air. Donald had different solutions - he tried
immersing the sound probe in a plastic bucket precariously balanced on the
patient's stomach - that didn't work and tended to end up soaking both patient
and doctor, so he tried another trick.
A fellow professor volunteered to buy condoms for Donald in a chemist's shop in
West Nile Street so that the eminent professor, a figure of some standing in
the Glasgow Episcopalian community, would be saved from scandal. He tried
filling the condoms with water but that did not work much better.
While these experiments were being carried out, an engineer from Kelvin Hughes
fitting a shadowless lamp in Donald's theatre returned to Hillington with the
tale of how the professor was using an industrial flaw detector.
Tom Brown was immediately inspired by the idea. That evening he contacted the
professor. Donald was friendly and invited Brown up to the hospital. Brown
quickly saw that the machine being used had been modified in a way that was
causing more problems than it solved. He took a new model to the Western
Infirmary. This was a contact scanner and it was possible to use it simply by
smearing the patient's stomach with olive oil and touching the probe to it.
This was Brown's radical solution to the contact problem, a technique broadly
similar to the one used today.
Work on the project continued and Brown came up with an oscilloscope camera to
photograph the ultrasounds. Soon, Donald was able to tell sceptics the story of
how he had saved the life of a patient believed to be dying of cancer. An X-ray
and other signs had prompted the cancer diagnosis, but an ultrasound test
showed she was actually suffering from an ovarian cyst which was cured by
surgery.
It was one of the directors of Kelvin Hughes, William Slater, who spotted the
commercial potential of the project Brown was involved in. He offered #500
towards the work and Brown was allowed to devote one working day a week to it.
Brown was soon designing a prototype machine. He was concerned the thing should
not look too initimidating for the patients and enlisted the help of a Glasgow
design student - now the principal of Glasgow Art College - Dugald Cameron to
help him.
Cameron is still proud of the order from Kelvin Hughes for the design drawing
he sold, for the world's first commercial medical ultrasound machine, dated
June 27 1961. It awarded him the magnificent sum of #21.
This ``elegant piece of equipment'' was the only one Brown actually supervised
in construction. Soon he was withdrawn on to another project and a modified
form of the machine - bulkier and more awkward - went into limited production.
But there was not the money or the belief in the machine for Kelvin Hughes to
carry on pumping cash into something that was as yet unprofitable.
The medical establishment was sceptical and hospitals in the west of Scotland
were not buying ultrasound machines.
Donald had published a paper in the Lancet, tentatively spelling out the
progress so far: ``The fact that recordable echoes can be obtained at all has
both surprised and encouraged us but our findings are still of more academic
interest than practical importance and we do not feel that our clinical
judgment should be influenced by our ultrasound findings.''
In response to the article, one eminent gynaecologist summed up the uses of
ultrasound as being for gynaecologists who were ``deaf, dumb and blind and had
lost the use of their hands''.
There were many in the medical profession who failed to see the potential of
the new technique.
By the early 60s, just as the global race for development of the new technology
was hotting up, Kelvin Hughes had been bought by Smiths Industries (England)
Ltd who closed down the Hillington factory. The ultrasound department was
bought by Nuclear Enterprises Ltd in Edinburgh. They sold off the stock and
carried on making similar machines but made few technological changes.
Brown says that the intense research and development work needed to stay ahead
just didn't happen. He went to work for Sonicaid in Livingston where in the
early 70s he researched into 3D scanners. It was virtual reality before you had
virtual reality, he says. Now work has restarted on similar projects. But his
work in the 70s was deemed too expensive and was discontinued.
Brown couldn't get another job in medical technology and ended up driving a
crane in the oil industry. ``I still believe that we nearly got there, we
nearly did it. But the money ran out,'' he says.
``I had to take the professional consequences of being associated with failure.
No-one wanted to employ me after the collapse of the 3D project. I was
unemployed and unemployable.''
This was the end of ultrasound pioneer Tom Brown's work in the field. Neither
he nor Professor Donald received much recognition for their contributions.
The story is a cautionary tale for Dugald Cameron: ``Here is a product that was
invented in Glasgow and here we are having to import it from Japan. It was a
wonderful product. We should have an electronics industry that is based on it.
The brains were here, the skill and talent and imagination were here but we
couldn't carry it though in terms of investment and business opportunity.''
At the Queen Mother's Hospital few of the expectant mothers who file out
clutching those strange little pictures, know that the technique that seems so
miraculous was invented so close to home.
In a little room hidden away at the back stairs, a collection of the early
equipment gathers dust.
In this unvisited room, hidden away from all but the most determined, a
portrait of modern pioneer Professor Ian Donald smiles above the first  human
ultrasound machine, cobbled together from a hospital bed table and a flaw
detector.
``It's not the original bed table though. I had to give that back to the
ward,'' says Tom Brown ruefully. ``I just managed to borrow it for a while.''

MORE than half of British employees expect their jobs will be less secure in
the year ahead, while three quarters expect they will be put under more
pressure at work, according to a Trades Union Congress survey published
yesterday.
For Scots the situation looks even bleaker. They registered figures of 56%
(against 52% for the whole of Britain) and 83% (Britain 74%) respectively.
The TUC says these job worries carry a stark economic and political warning.
Three in four workers say their employment situation makes it less likely they
will think of moving house next year, and almost two-thirds say they are less
likely to make large household purchases or raise their pension payments in
1996.
Commenting on the figures, TUC general secretary John Monks said the survey
showed people's insecurities at work were a serious brake on economic growth,
and were restraining the recovery in consumer spending and the return of any
real feel-good factor.
``If people lack confidence in the future of their jobs they will hesitate
about taking on major spending commitments,'' Mr Monks said. ``During the year
ahead this will increasingly damage the Government's economic strategy and
their political prospects.''
There was a political price to pay and the Government had exacerbated the
situation by removing many of the basic protections for people at work, Mr
Monks said. Giving employers a free hand had done little to improve economic
prosperity but had adversely affected much of middle Britain.
Job insecurity now affected the nation's core workforce, with the survey
revealing the highest levels of concern among professional and white-collar
workers and those in the prime of their working lives. Employees were most
worried in London, the West Midlands, and Scotland.
``Concerns about greater security and fairer treatment at work are set to
become a defining political difference in the year ahead, both within the
Conservative Party and between the Tories and Labour,'' he said.
