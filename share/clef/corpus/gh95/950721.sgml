IT WAS not entirely Sherry time for the Scots at St Andrews, writes
Ian Paul. Others, much more experienced, could go home to their dinners
feeling relatively pleased with themselves. Andrew Coltart and Sandy
Lyle certainly left the Old Course with a spring in their steps.
Coltart had a roller-coaster of a round but ended up with a fine
two-under-par 70 and is in excellent position to stay for the week.
The Thornhill professional had a tremendous start, with birdies at two
of the first three holes but then went off the rails with four 5s in a
row, three of them bogeys. One over at the turn, he then went into
birdie mode again, with four 3s in succession, three of them birdies.
The fourteenth, however, was where he said ''we were silly.'' His
drive landed in a divot, almost plugged, and he asked for a ruling in
case it was a rabbit scrape. He had to play as it was, used a No.3-wood,
and hit it into Hell Bunker, ending up with a 6. However, he came back
with a birdie 3 at the last.
Lyle kept his steady form of late going well enough to come in with a
one-under-par 71. The former Open champion was joint nineteenth in last
week's Scottish Open but that could have been a lot better and he felt
he was coming on to a solid game.
His round yesterday seems to confirm his own estimation. ''I was very
happy with that,'' he said, ''and I would settle for it in a opening
round in this wind here any time.''

SCOTTISH Commonwealth bronze medallists Alona Bruce and Nicola
Robinson will represent Britain at this weekend's Nations Cup event --
the world under-23 rowing championships -- in Groningen, Netherlands,
the only Scots to be picked.
Along with Gillian Lindsay and Kareen Marwick, Bruce and Robinson had
an outstanding season last year.
They won at both Ghent and Amsterdam and also reached the final at
Duisberg and the prestigious Lucerne Regatta.
Despite that impressive track record and taking bronze at the
Commonwealth Championships in Canada, Scottish pleas that they go on to
Britain's team at last year's world championships were dismissed by the
Amateur Rowing Association in London.
Now, at last, Bruce and Robinson have made it on to the that team. All
four of last year's crew have now based themselves in England to further
their rowing careers and, as a further ironic touch, both Lindsay and
Marwick have now achieved selection for this year's British world
championship team in Finland.
Neither Lindsay's four, which includes another former Scottish
internationalist, Kate Templeton, nor Marwick's pair could reach the
final at Lucerne this year, but are still considered good enough for
selection -- further evidence of the consistent dismissive track record
of the British authorities when it comes to Scottish affairs.

<HEADLINE>Armstrong wants to be back in the running again</HEADLINE>

GARY Armstrong, the Jed-Forest, Scotland, and British Lions scrum
half, has decided to seek at least one more season at the top -- and the
battle to win back his international place is under way in earnest.
The decision by Armstrong to seek further international honours ends
months of speculation, and yesterday the 28-year-old lorry driver told
The Herald that he had recovered his appetite for the game and was
determined to try for at least one more season at international level.
Armstrong, 28, whose glittering career has been cruelly interrupted by
a series of injuries, is in the final stages of recovery from
devastating damage to the left knee sustained in pre-season training 11
months ago.
It was the same knee injured three years ago in a club game -- an
injury which kept him out of the 1992 international championship -- and
during an operation to repair the damage, the joint was almost
completely rebuilt using carbon-fibre material to strengthen the
ligaments.
The injury was sustained during a tackle at Riverside Park when
Armstrong was preparing for the autumn seven-a-side circuit.
He was off work for four and a half months and the injury cost him his
place in Scotland's Five Nations' campaign and in the World Cup party
for South Africa.
Before the Scotland squad was chosen for the World Cup, Scotland's
management tried to persuade Armstrong to accelerate his recovery
programme at the Lilleshall sports injury centre in Shropshire. However,
the Borderer decided to stick to the timetable set by his medical
advisers at the Princess Margaret Rose Hospital in Edinburgh, and not to
chance physical contact on the damaged knee until 12 months had elapsed.
He has now resumed training with his club and he said yesterday that
if the knee stands up to the rigours of contact, then he wants to have
at least one more season of international rugby.
''Physically, I feel fine and mentally I am in better shape than I
have been for ages,'' he said. ''I just want to have one, or maybe two,
more seasons in a Scotland jersey. I have suffered so many injuries in
my career that I want to retire on my own terms and not be forced out of
the game because of injury.''
Armstrong, twice named The Herald Player-of-the-Year, won his
thirtieth cap against Ireland last year, having been persuaded to end
his self-imposed exile by the Scotland management.
The Jedburgh player had lost his appetite for the game, and he told
the Scotland selectors that he wanted to try himself out, inititally at
lower levels of competition, in a position other than scrum half.
''I just lost my way. Things were getting on top of me. I just wanted
to be an ordinary bloke again who did not have to be rushing away to
Scotland training sessions in every free moment. I just wanted to be
able to get up, go to work, play for my club, and still have time to do
ordinary things like wash the car at weekends. Looking back on it, I had
too much rugby,'' he said.
The 1994 comeback was curtailed by a thumb injury which required
surgery to re-attach a tendon to the bone, and Armstrong missed the
final game of the Five Nations championship, against France.
The news that Armstrong is seeking an international comeback will
gladden the hearts of the Scotland management, and mean even more
competition for the Scotland No.9 shirt.
Bryan Redpath of Melrose, the sitting tenant, had a fine World Cup and
Armstrong ackowledges that he will be difficult to dislodge.
The other rivals for the berth which Armstrong now wants to reclaim
are Derrick Patterson of West Hartlepool and Andy Nicol of Bath.
Armstrong said: ''It can only be good for Scotland if there are four
of us all going for the same position. It's just a pity that there isn't
the same rivalry for every position in the team because that makes for
really good sides.
''I might not make it back into the side but I'm going to give it my
best shot. At least I will know within myself that I didn't just go out
with a whimper.''

DISASTERS befall Jack Nicklaus rarely. In his first Open Championship,
at Troon in 1962, he took 10 at the eleventh, and at the tenth hole in
the 1986 US Open at Shinnecock Hills, he went so far as to lose a ball
which he thought at the time was the first occasion he had done so for
some 20 years, writes Raymond Jacobs.
Yesterday, in his thirty-fourth consecutive Open, the unimaginable
happened again -- he took 10 at the long fourteenth. Trying to reach the
green in two, Nicklaus attempted to bring off a 200-yard carry over the
crater known as Hell Bunker with a No.3 wood shot.
''I hit it as well as I could,'' he said later, ''and thought I might
still be 40 or 50 yards from the hole.''
Instead, his caddie spotted a ball in the sand and it turned out to
belong to Nicklaus after all. He needed four shots to extricate the ball
-- ironically, because, as he admitted, the first recovery attempt was
the easiest. ''I thought I could get it up to the green and made the
mistake of trying to get there.''
When Nicklaus did eventually reach the green he took three putts. But,
as he has shown in twice finishing second recently in senior tournaments
Nicklaus, at 55, can still compete and, characteristically, he had two
birdie 3s at the fifteenth and eighteenth to be home in 41 for a round
of 78.
At the end of the day there was quite a contrast between the scores of
the players who used to be known as the Big Three. Gary Player, aged 59,
was round in 71, but Arnold Palmer, 65, took five strokes more than
Nicklaus and his 83 stood as the highest score of the day.

Feherty keeps British options open at St Andrews
SINCE Tom Watson took his fifth Open Championship in 1983 only one
American professional, Mark Calcavecchia in 1989, has been successful.
Yesterday, in the first round of the 124th Open over the Old Course at
St Andrews, Watson, now 45, returned to the fray by sharing a one-stroke
advantage on 67, five under par, with two compatriots, John Daly and Ben
Crenshaw, and Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe.
Indeed, of the 17 players who broke 70, nine were from the United
States and the unexpected leader of the European challenge was, on 68,
David Feherty, whose career has been heavily in the doldrums. Berhard
Langer kept in touch with a 70, but Nick Faldo, on 74, and Colin
Montgomerie, on 75, are already engaged in a game of catch-up.
In a blustery west to south-west wind, which slackened somewhat as the
sluggish procession of five-hour rounds proceeded late into the evening,
the five amateurs all did themselves justice. Amateur champion Gordon
Sherry was on 70 with Steve Webster, Gary Clark was on 71, the European
champion, Stephen Gallacher, on 72, and the US champion Tiger Woods, was
round in 74, despite a 7 at the second.
Watson equalled his lowest first round in the championship and whether
or not the fact that his previous opening 67, at Royal Birkdale in 1983,
preceded that victory is a coincidence to be put to the test. The 74
with which he finished at Turnberry last year, when he was in the hunt,
cannot, another year on, inspire confidence.
That, of course, applies particularly to Watson's holing out, although
the putt he estimated at 70 feet which he made at the first, after a
pulled drive and a pushed approach, belied that. Yet from then on in the
left-to-right wind he struggled his way out and only came into his own
when it came from the opposite direction.
''The wind creates another hazard, which this course needs,'' Watson
declared, and in an inward half of 31 he mastered it most conspicuously
at the thirteenth and long fourteenth. First he brought round a
No.7-iron shot to within four feet of the most exacting pin position of
all and followed the birdie with an eagle 3, again shaping a No.3 wood
to 15 feet.
Since he won the US PGA title in 1991 Daly's life on and off the
course has not lacked for incident. Now he is learning patience to the
extent even of slowing down his walk to let his caddie keep up. A new
driver has given him a lower trajectory, but he is still long enough in
the right conditions to reach half a dozen greens with the club.
Into the wind at the 316-yard twelfth Daly did drive the green, but of
the seven birdies he made the most satisfying was at the long fifth. He
sent his second 41 yards past the flag-stick -- ''I know,'' he said
afterwards, ''because I paced it out'' -- and having lagged the first
putt to five feet he made the second.
Crenshaw, who has had a lean time since his second US Masters victory
in April, could become the first player since Faldo in 1990 to win these
two titles in the same year. Competing in his fourth Open here, Crenshaw
was pleasantly surprised that his form had so greatly improved since the
Scottish Open last week. ''I didn't know what to do with my swing or
Carnoustie,'' said Crenshaw, who missed the cut there by five strokes.
Although McNulty is 41 the last Open at St Andrews, in 1990, was his
first there. His first round was 74, to which he added scores of 68, 68
and 65 to finish equal second with Payne Stewart. He now seems certain
to complete four rounds at last after having missed seven consecutive
cuts on the US Tour as he attempted to retrieve his swing from the
change he inadvisably made last October.
The kernel of his score, as it frequently is here, was made round the
six holes of The Loop, the seventh through the twelfth, which he played
in four under par.
Beset by matrimonial strife and at heart an unwilling emigrant to the
US Tour Feherty, who finished equal fourth at Turnberry last year, was
delighted with his score ''after the way I've been playing.'' His two
34s were assembled very diffently -- four birdies and two bogeys before
the turn, two birdies and seven pars after it.
''I hope the anniversary of that performance at Turnberry will give me
the chance to dig myself out of the hole I'm in now,'' said Feherty,
attributing the 40lb in weight he has lost this year to ''my divorce
diet.'' If his one-liners were birdies Feherty would not be in the
reduced circumstances in which he now finds himself.
Corey Pavin, having won the US Open, played well for his 69 and
abounds in confidence. ''I tried to play intelligently for you have to
think your way round here when the wind blows,'' he said. Perhaps too
much thinking was the cause of his group, which also included Langer and
David Frost, being warned at the fifteenth to keep their place on the
course.
Nick Price could take satisfaction from his start of 70 in defence of
the title. He had six birdies but four bogeys, the latter caused, he
thought, by mental errors rather than faulty shot-making. But he was one
of only two players to birdie the fearsome seventeenth, with a No.7-iron
shot to 30ft which he felt was ''almost like stealing.''
Greg Norman's 71 was ''a good score the way I was feeling, but I'm
glad I played.'' He had one hour's treatment on his sore back before
starting but ''was not turning as much as I would like. I was not in
full flow and improvised as best I could around the injury. I went for
the middle of the greens rather than attacking the flag-sticks.''
Sam Torrance was satisfied with ''a reasonably solid round.'' He too
submitted to the seventeenth's rigours, a No.8 iron spurting out of the
rough almost against the wall beyond the road.
Colin Montgomerie carries his furies around with him like a knapsack.
They concentrate their venom these days on his putting, and yesterday he
had 37 shots on the greens. The burden of expectation on him may have
done for Montgomerie again.

Old Firm go on tour with a different outlook on signings
By KEN GALLACHER in Denmark
RANGERS manager Walter Smith will unleash the twin talents of Paul
Gascoigne and Brian Laudrup in the tiny town of Grena as Rangers open
their three-game tour. At the same time, the Ibrox team will parade the
new formation Smith intends to use in the season ahead.
As he arrived in the seaside town in Jutland which will be the team's
headquarters for the next week, Smith spelled out some of his plans for
the future. These will be put into operation publicly for the first time
when they face Brondby tonight.
Summer signing Gascoigne and last season's success story Laudrup will
be handed key roles in the new Rangers system. So will the former
Aberdeen full-back pairing of Stephen Wright and David Robertson.
Explained Smith: ''We have been working on the system in the
closed-door games we have had back home. What we want to do is allow the
players a set-up which will suit their abilities. I suppose one could
say we are playing three at the back -- but with some differences.
''Essentially we want to give Gascoigne and Laudrup freedom. We want
them to have the opportunity to express themselves, to show what they
can do. When you have players with their skills, then you must try to
build your team around them.
''Similarly, we have full backs who like to get forward and use the
ball and they will get the chance to do that.
''Coaches do not really impose tactics or systems on players -- the
type of players who are available tends to dictate the style of any
team.''
Last season, Smith experimented with three central defenders in Athens
and it brought defeat, and an exit from Europe. Similar attempts at club
level and with the national team have also failed.
I can remember the late Jock Stein trying it with the national side
and being left embarrassed by a group of players who simply did not want
to change from their normal way of play. However, at national level now,
Scotland manager Craig Brown has used it successfully in the European
Championship qualifying games.
Now Smith seems determined to persevere with the set-up he believes is
best for Rangers. ''We will not simply be using these tactics in
Europe,'' he insisted. ''This is how we see the team playing throughout
the season.''
Alan McLaren, of course, became used to this style with Hearts,
possibly the only Scottish club to use the system successfully.
Australian Craig Moore grew up in his home country playing the same
way and his mentor, former Australian manager Eddie Thomson, maintains
that a central defensive role is Moore's best position. Brian Reid, too,
could find it easy to slot into the style.
Skipper Richard Gough will be asked to gaffer the young men who will
be alongside him as Rangers attempt to utilise the skills available to
them in the best possible fashion.
However, while the tactics were Smith's main concern yesterday, some
of his players recognised that the midfield area of the team will
provide him with the kind of selection problems managers enjoy.
Stuart McCall said: ''There are possibly 10 players who will be
competing for just three or four places in the middle of the park. That
is how difficult it is going to be.
''Obviously, Gazza is the first name the manager will put down as he
names a team. All of us want to be in there playing alongside him.
''It is not going to be easy. Ian Durrant has been rejuvenated since
he came back from Everton and signed a new contract, and Charlie Miller
had a great first season.
''All of us, naturally, want to qualify for the Champions' League.
Losing to AEK last season was a kick in the ribs and it affected our
whole season.
''We played at our peak for perhaps only two months, in December and
January, and that won us the title. We need to do well in Europe.''
Here, when they face Brondby, the first hints will emerge as to how
successful this Rangers team may be -- and just how much influence
Gascoigne and Laudrup can have on the men around them.

ATHLETICS: BISLETT GAMES
LINFORD Christie could lose his world 100 metres crown within the next
48 hours. Though not due to defend his title until next month, the
outcome of races tonight, in Oslo, and on Sunday, in Sheffield, could
effectively decide the outcome of the world event in Gothenburg.
Christie has two outings, over 100m tonight, then 150m, in Yorkshire,
against Donovan Bailey, the world's fastest 100m man this year
(9.91sec). Unless he can achieve at least one victory over the Canadian,
then Christie will have handed his rival what may prove to be an
insurmountable psychological advantage.
Bailey yesterday warned Christie: ''I respect you -- but you don't
frighten me . . . I'm not saying I will win the gold medal. But if I run
as well as I can, I should be somewhere on the podium.''
Compatriot Bruny Surin, the world indoor champion and second in the
rankings with 9.97, and dangerous American, Dennis Mitchell, are also in
tonight's line-up, as is Darren Braithwaite, who collected the AAA title
when Christie defaulted last weekend.
With a best this year of 10.05, Christie, who has been in Germany for
treatment to a tendon problem, has a lot of ground to make up.
Steve Backley, one of the critics of the ''prove your fitness''
ultimatum by Britain's selectors, resumes his rivalry with world javelin
record-holder Jan Zelezny and European Cup winner Raymond Hecht. But
Colin Jackson is saving himself for Sheffield to fulfil his promise to
confirm his competitive fitness. It will be his only race before
Gothenburg.
An elite group of Kenyans have descended on the Bislett stadium, where
52 world records have been set since it opened in 1924, and the men's
5000m and steeplechase marks are among those under threat tonight. But
Algeria's Noureddine Morceli, who has melted five world records with the
searing sirocco heat of his talent, has snubbed the meeting for the
second year, after what he believed was an inadequate offer.
The two meetings will also be crucial to the world hopes of David
Strang. Scotland's European indoor 1500m champion has to post a time of
1min 46.50sec or better by Sunday to snatch a championship lifeline.
* DIANE Modahl's appeal against the four-year doping ban imposed on
her by the British Athletic Federation opens in a London hotel on Monday
and is likely to last at least two days.

IAN BROADLEY in Germany
CELTIC flew out to Germany yesterday to continue their pre-season
preparations, but manager Tommy Burns stayed behind in Glasgow amid
speculation that, after several disappointments in his efforts to
strenghten the squad, he was about to make a big signing.
In recent days, Celtic have been linked with German international
forward Andreas Thom, of Bayer Leverkusen, and Dundee United defender
Gordan Petric, and last night it was thought that a #2m move for Thom
was close to being completed.
Celtic have already lost out in close season efforts to sign top
continental players such as Dmitri Radchenko, Peter van Vossen, Marc
Degryse, and David Ginola, but managing director Fergus McCann has
promised the fans that stars will be brought to Parkhead. Last night,
however, cards were being played close to the chests.
Club spokesman Peter McLean said: ''Tommy Burns is still in Glasgow,
but he will fly out to join the players in the morning. As to the
transfer situation, we have no comment to make.''
Before the party left for Germany, Burns did say that he had targeted
more players to strengthen his side for the challenge ahead. But he
explained: ''I have tried hard to bring in players, but I will not spend
just for the sake of keeping some people happy.
''I will do what is best for Celtic. At the moment I have taken a step
back and am setting other targets. I hope there will be one or two new
players in place before the season begins.''
Meanwhile, Celtic midfield man Peter Grant revealed yesterday that he
cannot wait for the start of the new season and the prospect of playing
against Rangers' Paul Gascoigne.
The self-confessed Gascoigne fan said: ''Gazza is different class -- a
real quality player. That is a big challenge for me, because the better
the player you come up against the better you must become.
''To be fair, there are not many better than him. I think he will be a
success in Scotland, but, hopefully, not against Celtic.''
Grant has also threatened to dye his hair green for the first Old Firm
encounter of the season to outshine Rangers' record signing and his
cropped, blond crew-cut when they clash at Parkhead on September 30.
Grant has now fully recovered from the knee injury sustained in
helping Celtic to their Scottish Cup triumph and is not concerned by the
club's failure so far to match their Ibrox rivals in the transfer
stakes.
He said: ''I'm raring for the off to try to build on that success.
''Every year big clubs need players to freshen their squads. The fact
that we attempted to secure a world-class player like David Ginola
underlines Celtic's desire to bring the best here.
''In the end he didn't sign, but just as important for us is that John
Collins has agreed to stay.
''Pierre van Hooydonk, Phil O'Donnell, and Tosh McKinlay will be like
new players for us next season as they have never played for the club at
Parkhead before. Even old-timers like me agree it will be great to be
back playing at home.''
* DUNDEE were given a triple boost on the eve of their pre-season trip
to Northern Ireland when three rebels re-signed.
Manager Jim Duffy had warned earlier in the week that Dusan Vrto,
Morten Wieghorst, and Kevin Bain would not go unless they agreed to at
least accept one-month deals.
The trio have now signed on the monthly basis and will be included
when Dundee fly out for games against Omagh, Dungannon, and Portadown.
A fourth un-signed player -- defender Mike Teasdale -- is ruled out of
the Irish trip because of a knee injury.
* NORWICH City's Scottish international goalkeeper Bryan Gunn has
embarked on the comeback trail -- seven months after having broken an
ankle during a Premiership match against Nottingham Forest which
threatened his career.
The former Aberdeen player played for Norwich in their 2-1 victory
over Coleraine.

TOUR DE FRANCE
GERMAN Erik Zabel sprinted to his second stage win of the Tour de
France yesterday, again depriving Uzbek Djamolidine Abdoujaparov.
Zabel won the seventeenth stage over 154 miles from Pau in the
traditional mass sprint finish in Bordeaux. But there was controversy at
to the finish, with ''Abdou'' claiming he was hampered by one of the
German's team-mates.
One of the greatest sprinters, Abdoujaparov has taken the prestigious
green jersey as points winner three times in the past four Tours but has
yet to win a stage this year, despite being at the forefront of several
sprint finishes.
Abdoujaparov, who has long been trying to live down his reputation as
a wild and dangerous sprinter, appeared to weave dangerously across the
road from left to right in the final sprint but failed to get the edge
on the quicker Zabel. He said afterwards that Zabel's Telekom team-mate
Rolf Aldag, who led his fellow German into the closing sprint, had
hampered him.
However, Aldag denied he had hampered Abdoujaparov deliberately. ''I
just moved aside to let Erik go past, that was all,'' he explained.
Zabel, delighted with a second win to follow his sixth-stage victory
in Charleroi, Belgium, said: ''I felt on great form today. My team did a
great job, especially Aldag at the end.''
With just three stages left before Sunday's finish in Paris, Spain's
Miguel Indurain is almost assured of a record fifth consecutive Tour win
after having finished in the bunch to stay 2min 46sec ahead of Swiss
Alex Zuelle overall. Today's stage takes the race 104 miles from
Montpon-Menesterol to Limoges. Result:

KAREN Pickering and Paul Palmer, two of Britain's best medal prospects
for the European championships in Vienna next month, had morale-boosting
victories on the opening day of the British national championships in
Coventry yesterday.
Pickering, the defending champion, eased home ahead of former Olympic
medallist Sarah Hardcastle to win the 200 metres free-style in 2min
3.76sec.
With the internationalists aiming to peak in Vienna next month, times
were of little relevance but Palmer was more than happy to take the
men's 200m free-style title 1-52.74, ahead of Steve Mellor.
Graeme Smith, the only Scot in the British team, had to pull out
through illness.
It was a disappointing day for veteran Helen Statter. The Warrington
swimmer, who has competed in the last two Olympics and was trained by
Martyn Woodroffe before his departure last summer to take up the post of
Scotland's director of swimming, failed to defend either the 400m medley
or 200m butterfly.
Katie Goddard (Portsmouth Northsea) won the medley in 4-58.14, while
Helen Jepson (City of Leeds) took the butterlfy in 2-16.84, with Slatter
having to settle for bronze.

BRONDBY coach Ebbe Skovdahl yesterday tipped Paul Gascoigne to make as
big an impact at Rangers as his nephew -- Brian Laudrup.
Skovdahl, uncle to brothers Michael and Brian Laudrup, is justifiably
proud of his family tie to the Rangers forward who was Player of the
Year in both Scotland and Denmark last season.
His Brondby side will provide the opposition for Gascoigne's debut in
a public-park style stadium in the Jutland resort of Grena, and Skovdahl
expects the #4.3m midfielder to make a quick impact on Scottish
football.
''Of course I rate Paul Gascoigne very highly indeed,'' he said. ''He
has been one of the unluckiest players in the world with all the injury
problems he has had. But he has shown, and will again, that he can be
one of the best players in the world, too.
''When he gets fully fit for Rangers he can match what Brian has done
for them.''
Interest in the Grena fixture is running high in Denmark, with Laudrup
and Gascoigne set to enjoy the red-carpet treatment, and there will be
local TV coverage.
* RANGERS outcast Basile Boli seems to have missed a move back to his
native France.
Bordeaux and Lyon were interested in Boli, signed for #2.7m from
Marseille, but the French transfer deadline passed on Wednesday without
any move. As clubs are allowed to sign only one player until December
15, Boli would have to be a team's top priority.
Udinese of Italy also are reported to be interested in recruiting
Boli.
* CRAIG Brewster has agreed on a new one-year deal with Dundee United.
The former Raith Rovers striker had wanted a change but will now stay as
the Tannadice club try to regain premier-division status.
* NOTTINGHAM Forest manager Frank Clark will fly to Italy on Monday to
tie up the loose ends of Andrea Silenzi's move. The 29-year-old Torino
striker will be the first Italian internationalist to play in England
when the #1.8m deal is completed.
* FRENCH internationalist Patrice Loko was arrested by police for
violent behaviour in a Paris hospital yesterday. Loko, who recently
joined Paris St Germain from French champions Nantes, had been taken to
hospital feeling unwell, after damaging parked cars outside a
discotheque.
''He is psychologically in a state of shock because of serious
personal problems,'' said a spokesman for PSG.
Loko, top scorer in the French League last season with 22 goals,
failed to join his international team-mates for their flight to Oslo
yesterday ahead of France's friendly match against Norway tomorrow.

ALONG the road, roughly a drive, No.3 wood and No.5-iron shot from the
clubhouse at St Andrews, the local cinema is showing Batman Forever. At
the course the Kilmarnock Superman is going about his business.
If he ever wakes up, Gordon Sherry is going to leave a whole bundle of
us depressed. The Amateur champion is on a roll that threatens to ruin
preconceptions that have existed since the days of another amateur with
a rather unusual talent, Bobby Jones.
Big, 6ft 8in at the last count, amiable and quite clearly unaware of
the audacity of his performances in the last two weeks, Sherry carried
on his languid, kid-in-the-toy-shop displays with a marvellous
two-under-par 70 for his opening blast at the Open.
''I knew I could shoot that here, but I felt I could have done a bit
better,'' he said with the outrageous innocence that is the prerogative
of youth. ''I definitely feel I can do better tomorrow.''
Playing with a couple of rather more seasoned fairway players, Greg
Norman and Tom Watson, the Big G ambled his way round with a smile on
his face, chatted merrily, holed putts, murdered drives and generally
played as if he was having a grand day at the works annual outing.
Laid back? This kid is prostrate. If ever a temperament was suited to
this most demanding, yet slowest, of games, his is the one.
''I was a little nervous on the first tee, but that was all. I tried
to enjoy myself. After all, I was playing in my first Open at St
Andrews, I was partnered by two of my boyhood heroes and they were both
great.''
They thought a lot of our strapping big lad, too. Norman loved the
phlegmatic approach of the Kilmarnock boy. ''He is the breath of fresh
air the game needs,'' he said. ''He is so easy going. At the ninth tee
he said: 'I know I shouldn't use a driver, but I am an amateur, so I
will. I am not playing for money.' He then hit a beauty just short of
the green. It was hard to remember when we felt like that.''
Watson, too, was enthralled by Sherry. ''He was a dleight to play
with. He has such a great temperament. He can play, too. I told him we
will play a practice round at Augusta next year. I want to show him
around.''
Sherry, not surprisingly, slept the sleep of the innocent on the eve
of his big day but was sick in the morning. ''I had a stomach upset, but
I was fine afterwards.''
He was proud that Watson told him as they walked up the eighteenth
fairway: ''Enjoy the applause. It is for you as well. And you'd better
get used to it, because you have many more times to experience it in
front of you.''
All of this grand theatre did not prevent him from hitting the ball
with an impressive confidence. ''I know what has happened here and at
Carnoustie last week has surprised a lot of people, but it didn't
surprise me,'' said Sherry.
He saw his name on the leaderboard round about the sixth hole and
thought he might snatch a birdie or two round the loop, the sixth to
twelfth holes, to get up a bit higher. He didn't manage it, but his
birdies at the first, fifth and last, with only one bogey at the
sixteenth, provided him with a sound 70.
He was thrilled to receive a good luck message from the manager of his
local team, Kilmarnock. Alex Totten, whom he has never met, sent a
letter saying: ''Go out and express yourself. You are there on merit.''
He thought about how decent a gesture that was and added: ''Do you think
if I lost 8st I would get a game at centre half?''
Sherry, who finished fourth in the Scottish Open, is most people's
fancy for the top amateur prize this week, but he is thinking well
beyond that. ''I learned last week that I can compete with the best and
I want to do that again.''

SCOTLAND beat Ireland in a bowl-out yesterday after the match in
Belfast was wrecked by rain with Scotland at 77-2.
But it means that Scotland have retained the Triple Crown -- even if
they lose to Wales in Belfast today. England and Ireland, who meet in
the other game, both have already lost to Scotland. England beat Wales
4-0, also in a bowl-out.
However, defeat by Canada may have ended the Scots' chances in the
Youth World Cup in Holland despite having started with two wins. Now
they must beat the Dutch tomorrow before closing against England on
Sunday.
Coach Jim Love said: ''We've got to aim for second place. England now
look unstoppable, but the rest of the sides are evenly matched.''
Scores:
Canada 186; Scotland 170 (N McCallum 40).
ROBIN Smith warmed up for next week's fourth Test against the West
Indies with 156 not out for Hampshire against championship leaders
Northants. He hit thirty 4s and shared an unbroken stand of 223 with
skipper Mark Nicholas (80no) to steer the visitors to 353-3.
The West Indies seemed set to beat Kent quickly at Canterbury after
second-string pacemen Vasbert Drakes (5-20) and Ottis Gibson (4-47)
bowled them out for 95. But opener David Fulton (89) and Sri Lankan
Aravinda de Silva (102) led a fightback when the county were 12-2
following on.
The Sri Lankan, who scored 112 in a losing cause against Lancashire at
Lord's, hit sixteen 4s and two 6s yesterday to take his first-class
tally from seven knocks to 847.

THERE is no more international golfer than Vijay Singh, the man from
Fiji who shot a superb four-under-par 68 yesterday to get himself into
serious contention for the Open, writes Ian Paul.
He lists London as his current home, but plays on both the European
and US Tours. He has won titles in Nigeria, Sweden, Zimbabwe, Spain,
Germany, France, the Ivory Coast and Morocco as well as in the US. Now
he seeks a major championship to hoist him into the top division.
''I am happy with the way I am playing just now,'' he said. ''My game
has been good recently.''
He admits that the Open is the biggest prize of all, but is not keen
to put further pressure on himself by saying it is the one he must win.
''It would be nice to win it, but all I want is to keep playing well for
the rest of the week and see what happens.''
Singh birdied the second, third and seventh to reach the turn in 33
and faltered only at the tenth, where he had a bogey 5, making amends
with a birdie 4 at the fourteenth and a birdie 3 at the last.
''I think this was my best ball-striking round in the Open and I am
also putting well.''
Also striking the ball well was Scotland's Russell Weir, who broke par
for the first time in an Open with a one-under 71. He has never made the
cut in five previous attempts and last time at St Andrews shot 79-73 to
be dismissed by a long way.
''It would be nice to play all four rounds for a change,'' he said.
Fellow Scot Paul Lawrie had been heading for a very nice afternoon
score, too, when he reached the turn in 34, which included two birdies,
but the wheels came off in the tougher back nine, where he bogeyed
eleventh and thirteenth, and even a birdie at the fifteenth only eased
the pain of bogeys at the sixteenth and seventeenth. At the end of it
all he had a 73.
Ross Drummond had a mixed bag of a round, shooting three birdies and
three bogeys before finishing up with a 74.

Sad swansong for a golfing legend called Arnie
ONE more. Just one more round of golf today, and the 35-year Open
Championship career of Arnold Palmer will be over.
Good. The old boy is due a rest.
When he walked off the eighteenth green at 6.30pm last night in the
pouring rain, he looked a bit bedraggled, weary even. Someone said he
looked like a pensioner coming off his allotment.
Blasphemy it might be, but the great man even looked his age.
The 65-year-old's power has long been in its fading stage. The fire,
the brilliant light, has gone out and he is wise now to leave the fierce
competitiveness of Open battles to other, much younger men.
You know -- men like Gary Player, who went round the Old Course in 71,
one under par.
But then we must remember, Player is only 60.
The South African strolled up the eighteenth fairway 50 minutes ahead
of his Amercian friend Palmer, but soon Player also will grow too old to
hack it with the younger generation.
His time most assuredly will come. Perhaps it will be today.
Palmer's potency was diluted many moons ago, but by then, he had
become a hero, having won two Opens, one US Open, and four US Masters
titles, and his rapport with golf's supporters made him special.
He was elevated to a status beyond the reach of others, and even the
exemption clauses were altered so that he could play in this, his
twenty-fifth championship at St. Andrews. And why not. If anyone
deserves a little leeway, it must be Palmer.
However, watching him start a round which degenerated into his worst
ever first-round score in an Open Championship -- 11 over par and
propping up the scoreboard -- it might have been better had we not been
summoned by his presence for one final look.
Yes, it would have been better to have been left with more upbeat
memories -- bright, strong visions of his immense talent.
Even if he had gone, never to return, five years ago after he had
missed the cut by one stroke here last time St Andrews hosted the Open,
that would have been much more enjoyable and fitting.
He was 60 then, and few thought they would see him back for another
swing, risking pneumonia yesterday in an early evening downpour.
He may be a legend and the fans' favourite, but his passion for the
game has made him hit one championship ball too many, I fear.
A round with Palmer yesterday should have been a walk to remember, a
celebration of a supreme and proud sportsman, but instead of an
afternoon lit up by smiles and littered with warm memories, it all
became a five-hour hike for Palmer.
It should not have been like that because the great and the good
should be allowed to walk from our sight without anyone's pity trailing
behind.
But once or twice yesterday, whispered voices could be heard telling
the truth.
''He looks old, now,'' they said, and ''he's very hunched these days,
isn't he?''
Of course we all knew that, and we were all aware he couldn't hit with
the same venom. But even so, it was uncomfortable watching him make his
way around.
Even the famed legion, Arnie's Army, was depleted.
They were thin in number and one of them wearing an ''Arnie's Army''
badge on his chest like a badge of honour hobbled by with the help of a
walking stick.
How appropriate.
The Army, too, may have outlived their time and could probably now be
more aptly described as Dad's Army. At least they would be looked upon
in that light by the group of young boys who were lingering at the fifth
green when Palmer arrived with Peter Baker, who scored a two-under par
70, and Ian Baker-Finch, who had a dreadful round of 77.
Pointing towards Palmer, one of the boys asked: ''Who is that then?''
to be told by another: ''It's only Palmer. Let's go see who else is
playing.''
At least one of that group recognised him, which was more than the two
boys who saw Palmer tee off.
''Don't think I know him,'' one said. ''Doesn't matter. Can't be one
of the big names.'' Children can be so cruel at times.
Palmer himself, however, was not above self-ridicule and while waiting
to tee off after having opened his round with bogey, double bogey, par,
bogey, bogey, he turned to a marshal who was perched on a shooting stick
and said: ''If I keep playing the way I am, you won't need that, I
will.''
Soon after, though, he sounded more upbeat declaring to no one in
particular: ''Well, I think I'll start playing some golf.''
It was an attempt to get the adrenalin flowing, and it worked a treat.
Palmer set off on a charge with a run of pars, 4-4-3, but
unfortunately another bogey was lurking at the end of the outward half
which he completed in six over. The inward half showed a slight
improvement, and he negotiated that in five over thanks to another
splendid effort which saw him finish with four pars.
But perhaps we should all have known this would not be a good day for
the veteran when he failed to disguise a long yawn as he waited for the
match ahead to vacate the fifth fairway.
A nap might have helped, but play was already backing up, and there
could be no rest for anyone, not even the giants of the sport. However,
he did stop twice during the first nine holes to sit down and take off
his right shoe.
Could the great one have corns, verrucas even? Surely not.
Both times, he examined his shoe very carefully before tying it back
on.
Then, once or twice, Palmer sat on the damp grass staring far away
across the course. ''If only I were 20 years younger,'' he may have been
thinking to himself.
Yes indeed. If only he could turn the clock back, it might even be
possible to make up the acres of ground lost yesterday, but one more
round will be undertaken this afternoon, and then it really will be
over.
Palmer will probably enjoy every step, smiling and waving to his
disciples as he walks from the first tee to the eighteenth green, and
then into the realms of true legend.
That's where he belongs now -- and good luck to him.

Ross Finlay heads north in the company of a smoothie
ROVER was one of the first manufacturers to offer alternative body
styles on the same model at the same price. That applies most of the way
through the 800 range, from the entry-level 820i to the high-performance
Vitesse Sport and the luxury Sterling. They are available with four-door
saloon or five-door ''fastback'' bodywork at the same cost. Only the
2.7-litre two-door Coupe is a model entirely on its own, and at a
premium price.
There are several different engines in the range, starting with
Rover's own T-series two-litre, which also comes in far more powerful
turbocharged form in the 200bhp Vitesse Sport. The 2.7-litre V6 models
still use Honda power, but it is back to Rover engineering for the turbo
diesels, one of which a year or so ago managed 82mpg on an observed
economy run on motorways from London to Milan.
While the 800 is beginning to show its age compared with the more
recently designed 600, it remains an impressive looking car, especially
when seen front-on or from the side. That applies as much to the #16,395
base model 820i I have been driving, as to the more expensive versions.
One thing this car offers in abundance is space. There is a genuinely
roomy rear cabin, where passengers can lounge rather than just sit to
attention, and the boot will cope with masses of luggage.
Up front, the 820i is in need of a fascia re-design. The angular pod
for instruments and most of the switchgear looks very old-fashioned
compared with the sweeping approach now more in favour. Walnut veneer is
used quite sparingly in the base model, and you can see where some of
the price has been trimmed elsewhere. Only the front windows, for
instance, have electrical operation, and the sunroof is a wind-back
design.
Rover fits this model with a driver's airbag as standard, and manages,
unlike one of its major UK rivals, to include tilt-adjustment in the
steering wheel. The airbag-equipped wheel seems a little bulky, and
several drivers I know find that the positioning of the two upper spokes
does not let them have a particularly comfortable grip on the rim. There
is no provision for a passenger's airbag, which at least allows Rover to
persevere with the left-hand side fascia tray many of us appreciate.
Producing 136bhp, the two-litre T-series engine takes this quite bulky
saloon to 60mph in just under ten seconds and would eventually crank up
to a test track 125mph. Fuel economy is a shade better than you might
expect, because the 820i returns figures like 47mpg at 56mph and 38 at
75, as well as 24mpg around town.
Unlike the Vitesse Sport, which was the previous 800 I had driven, the
820i is not regarded as a very lively car. There are criticisms of its
ride characteristics, not so much in general as in the fact that,
especially when taken along a road with any major undulations, it sets
up a pitching motion which forces the driver to ease back on the
throttle. However, I feel that the handling and steering, if by no means
sporting, are better than many people suggest.
My longest drive in the test car was to Caithness and, running behind
time, I was trying to keep up a good average on the A9. This is always
an enjoyable process as the road goes beyond Brora and Helmsdale, where
there are plenty of sweeping bends -- sometimes blind but very rarely
tightening up on themselves -- as well as climbs like Berriedale and the
Ord, and the consistently smooth surface this car prefers.
In these circumstances, hurrying the Rover means doing the opposite of
heaving it around. There is no point in steering from the shoulders or
even from the wrists. Light finger movements on the wheel rim are what
it appreciates, and it will then cover the winding miles quite smartly,
even if it would hardly show so well on round-the-bypass blasts.
Take it easy: the Rover 820i responds to a lighter touch from drivers

Building societies gaining market share from the banks
IT WAS very much a case of the calm after the storm in Far Eastern and
European markets yesterday, as the shockwaves from two successive
50-point falls on Wall Street were largely deflected.
Tokyo set the pattern for the rest. A 240-point drop in the Nikkei
Dow-Jones index was reversed and by the close the market was 31 points
higher. Frankfurt also ended trading slightly ahead.
In London the FTSE-100 share index fell 23 points at the outset, but
there was little evidence of panic selling. The index confined its
retreat to 4.9 points enabling it to close at 3400.4. Paris was the main
exception with losses extending to 1.3% despite a quarter point
reduction in the intervention rate.
It would probably have been a different story had Wall Street's
mid-afternoon loss of 134 points on Wednesday not been cut back to 57 by
close of play. The late rally was almost as notable as the dramatic
sell-off. Nevertheless trading in New York had been the third largest in
history.
The absence of any follow-through yesterday on Wall Street also helped
to steady nerves, but it is much to early to conclude that the crisis is
over.
There is no doubting the message from Alan Greenspan's testimony to
the Senate banking committee. Far from staring recession in the face the
US economy is heading for a recovery after a short pause. The Fed's rate
cut earlier in the month has been made to look unnecessary and unwise.
The last few hundred points of Wall Street's advance may well have
been based on a false premise. The bubble burst first in the technology
sector, but values across the broader market are very demanding.
The average dividend yield is just under 2.5% against, for example,
nearly 4% in the UK. But prime rates in the US are 8.75%, two per cent
higher than UK base rates.
Other major financial markets, notably London, underperformed Wall
Street on the way up. This should curtail losses if New York retreats
sharply.
Recent hopes that the Footsie would be able to retrieve record levels
of February last year above the 3500 mark may have to be set aside
meantime. Uncertainty about Wall Street's ability to sustain current
levels is bound to act as a damper on equity markets elsewhere. But at
least the UK does not have much of a technology sector to upset the
applecart.
Market share
A STRONGER set of figures from the Building Societies Association
yesterday is unlikely to herald a recovery in the depressed housing
market. The societies seem to be gaining market share at the expense of
the banks on the back of attractive fixed-rate offers.
There is also the point that a mortgage with a building society may
yield a cash or share bonus from corporate activity. Societies, such as
the Halifax and Leeds, are merging and planning flotation; or, like the
National and Provincial and the Cheltenham and Gloucester, they are
being taken over by banks. The amalgamation process may be a bit of a
fad, but it should have further to run.
Gross lending by the societies increased from #3176m in May to #3533m,
while net advances jumped from #937m to #1276m. Net new commitments were
also a touch better at #3612m (#3598m).
Net lending was 36% higher than in May and 11% better than in June
last year. Gross lending sported growth of 11% month-on-month and 10%
year-on-year. Net new commitments are at their highest level since March
this year and outstanding commitments at their highest level since June
1992.
The association's director-general, Adrian Coles, was wary of his own
figures, which also showed a net inflow of funds of #346m from #860m in
May.
''While these figures are encouraging for the building society
industry, they are likely to have been strengthened by seasonal factors
and market share effects,'' he said.
In fact the increase in net advances by the building societies in June
(the second consecutive month they have risen) was not sufficient to
offset a decline in lending by the banks. The detailed figures from the
British Bankers' Association, which accompanied the Bank of England's
money supply figures, showed that mortgage lending is continuing to
decline.
The weakness of the housing market is the biggest single drag on the
economy. Not only does it hit the building industry, struggling to
recover from its worst ever recession, but it is also damaging to the
retail sector, particularly those with businesses selling household
goods.
Mixed bag
The M4 money supply figures were a mixed bag yesterday. Broad M4 was
exceptionally strong, but M4 lending by the banks and building societies
notably weak.
Broad M4 increased by 0.6% last month and the year-on-year rate rose
from 6.3% to 6.7%, the second successive month it has been in the upper
half of its 3% to 9% monitoring range. The three-month annualised rate
is 7.8% and the six-month rate 9%.
The strength of the figures was put down to the erratic overseas
component and a small underfund of the public sector deficit.
By contrast M4 lending was just #1700m, after a run of #8500m, #4700m,
and #5500m in the three preceding months. Having taken on short-term
debt to finance its #9000m takeover of Wellcome, Glaxo is now repaying
it by issuing Eurobonds. This had the effect of depressing corporate
lending last month, just as Glaxo's earlier activities had boosted it.
The other element of note in the British Bankers' figures was a sharp
fall in personal sector borrowing for consumption. This is an erratic
element in the figures, and over the second quarter as a whole there was
a robust increase.
The money supply and building society figures will not have much
influence on monetary policy, but the second quarter gross domestic
product figures later today, which are expected to show a fall in the
growth rate from 0.7% to 0.5%, could be a crucial determinant.

PEARSON has expanded both ends of its media-to-entertainment empire
with the $201m purchase of a US financial data specialist and
confirmation of plans for a New York entertainment project.
Pearson has signed a deal to buy Interactive Data Corporation from
information services group Dun &amp; Bradstreet to flesh out the US
activities of its Financial Times Group division, publisher of the
Financial Times newspaper.
It also confirmed that its Tussauds Group unit, which runs London's
Madame Tussauds waxworks exhibition, would be ploughing about $30m into
a new hi-tech attraction on New York's 42nd Street.
As part of the acquisition of Interactive Data, Pearson said the
Financial Times Group had also signed a five-year agreement to
co-operate with Dun's Moody's Investors Service to create a database of
quoted companies around the world.
The Interactive deal is due to be completed by the end of August.
Interactive Data made operating profits of $13.6 million on sales of
$66.8m in 1994.
''The international expansion of our electronic information business
complements the worldwide development of the Financial Times which began
in 1979,'' said Financial Times Group chief executive David Bell.
Analysts said the purchase would fit in well with the British
financial data specialist Extel that Pearson bought for #73.5m in 1993
and was easily within Pearson's current balance sheet capabilities.
Pearson's planned Tussauds development in New York will include wax
figures created by the Tussauds studios and will be housed in a
five-floor centre covering 60,000sq ft.
Pearson said research showed the centre could attract up to two
million visitors a year.
New York's 42nd Street has been designated a redevelopment area in the
Times Square district known for its sex shops and girlie shows.
Pearson's other interests in the United States include the
Addison-Wesley publishing group and last year's $462m acquisition of The
Software Toolworks, renamed Mindscape. -- Reuter

MAGNUM Power, a Scottish hi-tech company which was floated last year,
said yesterday that it would take a year longer than expected to produce
profits.
The announcement sent its shares plunging 35p to 135p.
Magnum, which has patented a minature device that prevents the
interruption of power supply to electronic equipment, had earlier
forecast that it would break even by the end of 1995.
But the company said its failure to secure an expected large order
from North America had put back the target until next year.
Bill McCall, an analyst with Tilney in Edinburgh, said the 22% plunge
in Magnum's share price was not surprising given the volatility of
hi-tech shares and the hammering suffered by computer companies on Wall
Street this week.
''I think the big problem here is that they have not delivered the
goods that people expected them to. With these new technology stocks
it's high risk and high reward,'' Mr McCall said.
''A lot of lessons have been learned from Tadpole Technology,'' he
said, referring to a small English computer company, whose shares have
been notoriously volatile.
Magnum announced a pre-tax loss of #2.34m for the year to May 31,
which was in line with its own forecasts.
Company secretary Robert Hynd said Magnum expected a further pre-tax
loss in the current financial year, but it should reach an operational
break-even point by December 1996.
''It will occur sometime during 1996, but it will depend very much on
ongoing discussions for future contracts,'' he said.
Mr Hynd said the planned contract to fit Magnum's power guarantee
device to the electronic tills of a major US retailer had been postponed
due to the recent downturn in US High Street sales, but not cancelled
outright.
''It's been put on hold, but we hope that it will go through sometime
in the future,'' he said.
On a more positive note, Magnum said it had recently signed a deal
with Japan's Sumitomo Corporation to distribute its Built-In
Uninterruptible Power Supply (BI-UPS) in the Far East.
It also announced a new #280,000 order by Apricot Computers, a
UK-based subsidiary of Japan's Mitsubishi conglomerate. That lifts the
total value of new orders over the last six weeks to #470,000.
Magnum's BI-UPS device is a low-cost card that can be inserted into
computers to keep them going for between 30 minutes and seven hours in
the event of power failure.
The company said the device can be easily built into equipment such as
personal computers, file servers, and electronic tills and it is trying
to persuade manufacturers to make BI-UPS a standard component.
The present generation of uninterrupted power supply units are larger,
heavier and have to be fitted externally. They are also more expensive.
At present Magnum manufactures BI-UPS itself at a small factory at
Girvan. But in the long run it hopes to licence manufacturers to produce
them on a much larger scale in the Far East.
The company has more than 40 people involved in research and
development at its headquarters in Coatbridge.
It was founded by managing director Vincent Lavin, an Englishman who
patented the BI-UPS in California in 1987. His marriage to a Scottish
lass brought him to Coatbridge two years later and he and the company
have been based here ever since.
Just over a quarter of Magnum's 48 million shares were floated in the
stock exchange in two separate operations in August 1994 and March 1995.

THE National Lottery has made headlines again this week. A new survey
shows continuing problems for charities, and in a Joseph Rowntree
Foundation Report it stands accused of transferring money from poor
communities to benefit the rich -- and leading some of the most
vulnerable people into addictive gambling.
Sorry to sound cynical, though, about one main conclusion in a report
which rightly says it is as important to know about the losers as about
the winners. And which has some excellent recommendations to ensure poor
communities gain more of the cash being grabbed for arts and heritage by
the affluent middle classes for their leisure pursuits. Rowntree warns
of a possible public backlash and loss of sympathy for the lottery
''unless there is action to reassure the public that its benefits
outweigh any harmful social consequences''.
I fear chance would be a fine thing. Outrage there may be at
particular millennium junkets. But it's hard to believe swelling social
concern about this massive weekly redistribution of spending money from
society's losers to the Treasury and big business will lead people to
stop buying tickets for the lottery itself (which, let's face it, brings
genuine fun and excitement); or even the ubiquitous, iniquitous, costly
scratchcards.
There are at least three reasons for doubt. Thatcher may have come and
gone, along with the early 80s excesses of individual boom and slump.
But the cop-yourself-a-personal-fortune mentality lives on in all
influential quarters, not just through sleaze scandals, and bombards us
at every turn. Scratch this card, fill in this line, shout the warring
tabloids; hit the jackpot on every game show; help the Labour Party,
proclaims its regular unsolicited mail, and win a Vauxhall Corsa.
Borrow today and buy your dream: even the venerable Bank of Scotland
has taken to ringing people's homes chattily at teatime. ''Hi, I'm Vera,
did you get my letter about our new personal loans? We could arrange it
now over the phone.'' I should have said what I felt -- this is
outrageous, go take a hard look at how far you've sunk.
Secondly, the least publicised piece of lottery research (for Camelot
itself) casts some pretty stunning doubt on our social consciences and
reveals how pervasive ''I'm all right Jack'' has become. The first
research analysis of 120 people who won more than #50,000 on the lottery
found only 15% intended giving something to their families and only one
person who said any of their windfall was going to charity. Right
enough, it's hard to recall press reports of any big winners mentioning
it.
This is amazing, when you think of it. What have our moral values come
to? I don't believe this is just my Catholic Calvinist legacy, of a
mother who insisted we reluctantly give 10% of our paltry #25 premium
bond win away. Surely most people would assume winners had a bit to
spare? If the biggest gave even one-tenth of their windfall to good
causes they'd still have between #40,000 and #18m to do up their house,
make the world tour or buy their favourite football club.
TV anguishes us nightly with horrors against humanity -- Bosnia,
Rwanda, earthquakes, wars, and famine. Yet only one person in 120 is
moved to spare some dosh for their local pensioners' group, let alone to
support inspiring community leaders in South Africa or 50 other
countries.
These people aren't even attracted by the fame and international kudos
of becoming big cheese benefactors, naming countless university
departments or leisure centres? Nor by the fun and huge political
satisfaction of deciding whom to land #1m upon; I could enjoy weeks of
intrigue over that, turning penniless feminist groups into dangerous
forces of world subversion.
The Scrooge factor is all the odder when you consider the huge
problems of most winners in thinking of anything to do with their loot.
(This extraordinary problem would never worry me, nor, I suspect, many
of you.) Far from being wildly extravagant and adventurous, or blowing
their fortunes in Vegas casinos, most winners in the Camelot survey had
begun ''home improvements'' and cautiously invested most of their cash.
(Perhaps to pay for the exorbitant costs of basic social or health care
in their old age.)
Thirdly, if there's to be a mass sharpening of social conscience after
so many years of popular tolerance towards betrayal of the poor, the
main political opposition surely has to be a leader in that. It's become
unfashionable to protest at the contents of Blair's new Jerusalem for
fear of damaging such a long-awaited drive to power, and of being
labelled a Bill Morris neanderthal (though he didn't do badly, after
all). But the result is leaving increasing numbers of disquieted people
-- even traditional moderates -- feeling voiceless, alienated, and
utterly bemused: at what we now fail to hear, as much as at what we do.
Where do the ''underclasses'' find supportive voices against injustice
and inequality now, when the Opposition clamours for more toughness on
crime, more punitive eviction policy, more firmness to root out social
security scrounging? When its leader sends his son to a private school?
How is it possible or imaginable that the Labour Party has made no
clear commitment to restore welfare benefits to 16 and 17-year-olds --
loss of which has brought so much suffering in so many directions?
Somehow that was symbolic above all else, it was the bottom line.
It does seem unlikely that a party which has grown so fearful of
offending either the better-off or certain kinds of populist sentiment
would take a hard stand on smaller matters like the lottery
scratchcards, which dazzle from the counter whenever we buy our
groceries or collect our Child Benefit. A hard, vocal line not because
poorer people need to be patronised, but because the cards are a bad
deal already playing debt havoc with many people who need that like a
hole in the head -- especially those mothers who aren't the family
members buying them.
The situation doesn't need to be monitored and researched, as Rowntree
suggests: these scratchcards need to disappear. It could yet be poverty
campaign groups, which have so often cut through the flannelling
verbiage of politicians, which take the lead in calling for that.

''KIRSTY,'' I said to Tom Shields in the Press Bar, which is embedded
in the fabric and soul of The Herald building, ''youse want a drink?''
Shields replied. ''Certainly Kirsty, a wee half of lager.'' I motioned
to Des, our publican. ''Yes Kirsty,'' he said, ''whit fur?'' I replied
with elaborate courtesy. ''Well, Kirsty,'' I said to Des, ''we would
like a wee hauf and hauf, Kirsty.'' The greetings were even more
elaborate than the courtesy. Because we had all come up with the theory
that to get a job anywhere at all in the United Kingdom, but especially
in print, television, and radio journalism, you are going to have to be
called ''Kirsty''. So we are all going to be Kirstys.
I do not know when this happened, this Kirstyism. As a boy or young
man, anyway, I never met one. Girls had names like Janet and Margaret. I
never met a boy called Damien. But girls had names which were as
ordinary as girls, in those days, looked. Now they have splendidly odd
names but they all have the same ones. Kirsty. Maybe Kirsty Wark was the
first one to emerge into journalistic stardom. What made Kirsty a real
star was the simple fact that she looked like a clever girl, a bit of a
blue-stocking, a girl you wanted to sleep with and then discuss apres
Simone de Beauvoir. A sort of Second Sex really.
And then a plethora of women came into their own in radio and telly.
Today we have entire progs run by nothing but females. You get older
chaps presenting and young women co-presenting. That was at first. Now
it is two ladies telling you news. In fact women are at a premium in the
media and no harm in that save the fact that they are never middle-aged
ladies and they are always pretty. And usually very hard-headed indeed.
In fact most of the women in the media are not merely hard-headed, they
are hard-hearted as well.
Let me digress for a spot. I have worked on a number of occasions for
women bosses: it has not been a pleasant experience in the main. True, I
worked once with a principal teacher of art called Miss Galt, who was
the soul of niceness, but that was because Betty was an artist who was
broadminded enough to pass for Texas Guignan (look that reference up,
Betty), but I yet remember Miss Alexander in the office of public works
in the old Glasgow Corpy who once told me to ''stop talking and get on
with your job''. I didn't stop talking and I didn't get on with my job
either: I walked out, having resigned on the spot.
Then there was Mrs Wilson who sacked me in a pub and in public because
I had bought an old pensioner a drink out of my own pocket because the
auld fellow couldn't afford a whisky and was going to be forced to go
back to a wee single end which he couldn't afford to heat. Mrs Wilson
isn't her real name because she is still in business, though the cow
shouldn't be. The old man is long dead, but Mrs Wilson isn't. I hope she
recognises herself.
Let me go back to the beginning. You cannot believe how many lady
broadcasters I have done profiles upon, and I did Kirsty Young because
she had a very mellifluous voice on a radio show she did when she was 20
called School's Out and she was very good at it, but of course it helped
that she was called Kirsty. I did the first ever profile on Lesley
Riddoch because Lesley is simply the cleverest broadcaster of them all.
Lesley hails half from Glasgow and half from Belfast, which means she is
very difficult to beat in any argument at all indeed. I once walked into
a bar with Lesley and Lesley is six feet tall or thereabouts and I am a
dapper little chap. The only other customer in the pub spied ourselves
and was heard to murmur: ''Jesus Christ, Simon and Garfunkel huv just
came in.'' But there are more ladies in journalism.
Sheena MacDonald is chilling in her professionalism and very good at
her job. Ms Stark, who does a marvellous job in her Slice prog on Radio
Scotland, is an ex-school librarian and is the sort of girl who sends
you postcards from Aberdeen art gallery of favourite paintings because
she remembers half-said comments.
My favourite girl of the moment from the media world is that
incredibly tall lassie who presents Scottish Telly's Trial by Night and
sometimes NB as well, she of the short skirts and legs up to her oxters,
Susan Maxwell. Susan sometimes has a difficult time of it because she is
very lovely and looks, well, lovely, and the last thing co-female
broadcasters want anywhere near them is a lovely broadcaster, especially
a female one.
But you may have noticed that by and large I am ever against the
female journos and I will tell you why. Whereas the ladies from
marketing and advertising -- branches of the media, and important ones
-- are invariably nice and grand to talk to and dress like film stars,
the truth is that a large number of female journalists are not nice at
all. In fact they are dragons at that.
The lady journalists on my own paper who reply to my cheery greeting
of a morning or afternoon know who they are, but the ones who sniff in
the air like Trabb's boy out of Great Expectations know themselves too,
I would not doubt. Yet the lady journalists have spent over 20 years
incessantly writing not the agenda -- a greatly over-used word these
days -- but the menu for feminism. An aggressive stance has been taken.
Had lady journalists and young women taken as their role model for a
lady journalist it should have been a lady. I can think now of Katharine
Whitehorn. Or Mary McCarthy. Or indeed Ireland's own Mary Kenny, a lady
who can get more things right in one week's article than she can get
things horribly wrong in the week's before.
Instead the lady journalists combine whingeing and whining, culled
from Germaine Greer and the late Jill Tweedie, with a touch of
unreadable lesbian novelists. This sounds a bit like a male greet as
well. But it isn't. I will give you an absolute guarantee that I shall
not be soundbiting on the wireless for quite some time because the Women
in Media mob will give me more of a blackballing than Freemasons could
manage with Gerry Adams. By the way, Kirsty is a diminution of the name
''Christian''. It's a boy's name. There.

McClellan is expected to leave a Milwaukee hospital this weekend to
return to his home in Freeport, Illinois.
McClellan was critically injured during February's ferocious fight

IRISH Premier John Bruton was urged last night to seek an early
meeting with Mr John Major to boost the Northern Ireland peace process.
Dublin's Fianna Fail opposition party deputy leader Ms Mary O'Rourke
warned that frustration was growing and that Sinn Fein plans to stage
street protests was ''potentially explosive''.
She said: ''It is time for John Bruton to seek now an urgent meeting
with John Major. An impasse has been reached and it is a very serious
one, facing into the month of August, a time when we shall be leading up
to 12 months of a ceasefire.''
Yesterday's transfer of three prisoners was ''a small step forward,
but only that'', she said. She added that Sinn Fein had been waiting
''for months for some signal, some move forward by the United Kingdom
Government towards the peace process moving into talks and signs that
the prisoner issue is going to be addressed''.
Sinn Fein members chained themselves to the railings of the British
embassy in Dublin yesterday as the party apparently rejected a call by
Mr Bruton to abandon the street protests plan.
Sinn Fein has announced it will hold its first demonstration,
demanding all-party talks ''without pre-conditions'', outside Belfast
City Hall this afternoon.
Meanwhile, a group of Irish American politicians and businessmen, who
played a key role in talks that led to the IRA ceasefire last year, will
be back in Ireland for talks in Dublin and Belfast next week.
Spokesman Niall O'Dowd said: ''We are returning because there clearly
is a sense of crisis about the peace process. We are concerned that it
could slip through everyone's fingers.''

SCOTTISH seed potato growers are being urged to publicly declare their
support for the Scottish Deed Potato Development Council.
In a circular to producers SSPDC chief executive John Bethell says
that when the Potato Marketing Board is wound up 1997 it is important
that a strong independent Council be set up for a five year promotion of
seed at home and abroad, based on a levy of no more than #25 per
hectare.
It supports the need for a successor organisation to the PMB, now
being considered by Ministers but is concerned about the special
interests of the seed sector. ''Council believes that if Scottish seed
growers want to argue a strong case for specialist treatment in any
National Organisation they should be seen to be committed to a long term

Meanwhile, the potato industry Joint Consultative Committee has
announced that with the rundown of the PMB after the 1996 crop and
considering market factors, it is recommending that next year should be
a non quota year and has decided not to set a target area.
It decided that the overall production guileline should be 146,000
hectares divided between registered producers according to their 1996
basic area.
* THE potato industry and consumer bodies are being given until
September 30 to provide Government offices with views on the plan to
wind up the Potato Marketing Scheme. The scheme is to continue in
modified form until 1997 when the industry will be in a free-market
situation.

THE principal problem for commercial beef producers at present is
finding suitable replacements for the suckler herd according to a
leading beef specialist.
Speaking yesterday at an open day organised by the Beef Shorthorn
Cattle Society at The Grange, Castle Douglas, Dr Basil Lowman of the
Scottish Agricultural College, laid the blame at the increasing use of
Holstein blood.
He commented: ''Holstein is the swear word of the century. The main
problem is their extremely poor confirmation and calving performance
which makes their crosses largely unsuitable for the suckler herd.''
Dr Lowman reckons that the average suckler herd incurs a cost of
around #30 per cow just getting each calf on the ground and overcoming
calving problems.
However, he acknowledged that breeders with autumn calving herds have
discovered that problems could be greatly reduced by keeping their cows
''very lean'' on the approach to calving.
Dr Lowman added that this strategy was not without its own costs.
''The trouble is that after calving the farm is then faced with a bill
feeding the cows like blue blazes to get them back in calf. Inevitably
some are late in coming to the bull and on a herd of 100 cows that can
easily come to another #500.''
Solving these problems is a must for the beef industry said Dr Lowman.
''Beef is about flesh and confirmation. We must improve the eating
quality of the product because if we don't people will stop buying it.
''Remember beef is in competition with 3000 other lines on the
supermarket shelves. The one scientific fact we know for sure is that
Holstein beef eats worse than any other breed, therefore, Holstein blood
devalues the eating quality of beef.''
Dr Lowman, while praising the inititiative of those farmers breeding
their own replacements, said that they must have clear objectives.
Commenting on the merits of the Shorthorn breed he said: ''Bulls will
only sell if they produce heifers with flesh, milk and fertility.
''At SAC we lose most cows because of infertility and after that
through faulty udders. I advise all breeders to speak to dairy farmers
about the heritability teat placement and learn from them.''

DESPITE the Diary's legion of contacts and local correspondents
throughout Scotland, we miss the occasional scoop. We shall be asking
our man in Inverness why, for instance, the Sun, a tabloid newspaper
sold in supermarkets in the USA, beat us to the story of the capture of
the Loch Ness monster.
The newspaper reports that Nessie was caught during a joint operation
between British and US underwater forces with additional help from
paratroopers. The troops were actually confronted by three monsters. An
unnamed eyewitness recounted: ''After paratroopers descended on the lake
with rubber boats, the biggest of the three creatures was quickly
subdued with a 3ft-long tranquilliser dart.
''Thick ropes were used to secure the animal while troopers kept the
other two Nessies at bay with occasional jolts from high-powered
electrical prods. The captured Nessie was later hauled up to the side of
the headquarters ship and towed to a heavily secured part of the lake.''
Garrett Clayton, ''a London anthropologist and Nessie expert'', is
quoted as saying he hopes Government scientists will be able to learn
more about Nessie now that one has been captured. But he also fears
retaliation. ''We are dealing with a close-knit family of intelligent
creatures,'' he says.
Normally, we would be sceptical about such reports but the newspaper's
front-page photograph looks quite convincing.
The Name Game
ACTOR Mel Gibson was chieftain the other week of the Chicago Highland
Games, sponsored by none other than Tennents, the lager that made
Glasgow famous. As part of the publicity, the Chicagoans were urged to
look out for Mel's new movie, Braveheart, the story of the Scottish hero
''Sir William Wallis''. Yes that William Wallis who went on to found a
chain of women's dress shops.
Windy reply
AN allegedly genuine piece of dialogue from a social security office
in the East End of Glasgow where a single parent is being quizzed on
behalf of the Child Support Agency as to who is the father of her
new-born baby. ''Listen, hen,'' she replies. ''When ye eat a tin o'
beans ye don't know which wan made ye fart.''
Artistic licence
JUST when you thought we had finished with the Auld Alliance and the
special relationship between Scotland and France, we hear from Heather
Major, a teacher in Dunfermline, who asked some dear second-year girls
if they could tell her what Impressionism was. ''It's French for
colouring-in,'' one replied.
Colour of money
THE Scottish Children's Press of Aberdeen is taking a proudly
old-fashioned stance with two new books -- Aitken Drum and Kitty
Bairdie, both in Doric and both based on old folk songs.
Inside each front cover there is a statement: ''This is a black and
white book. Today's children are continually blasted with high-colour
images -- television, food packaging, shop displays, and, yes . . .
books. This series of books offers the reader the opportunity for
discussion, speculation, and invention; the colours and 'smells' of the
book when read on one day will be different from those when the book is
next read.''
The price of each book is, however, remarkably up to date at #4.95 for
less than 16 pages.
Novel Bible
WE continue our trawl through God's Word, the American translation of
the good book which World Publishers of Iowa is promoting over here by
giving a free copy to every minister in the land.
It is promoted as ''today's Bible translation that says what it means.
God's Word has a friendly, easy style. It looks like a book and reads
like a novel.''
Compared with the King James version, much of the majesty of the
language is lost in translation. Such as the tale of the loaves and the
fishes in Luke, chapter nine:
But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no
more but five loaves and two fishes, except we should go and buy meat
for all this people. (King James Version).
Jesus replied, ''You give them something to eat.'' They said to him,
''We have five loaves of bread and two fish. Unless we go to buy food
for all these people, that's all we have.'' (God's Word version).
The following is St Matthew's description of Christ walking on the
water:
And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on
the sea. And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were
troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.
The easy-to-follow American version reads:
Between three and six o'clock in the morning, he came to them. He was
walking on the sea. When the disciples saw him walking on the sea they
were terrified. They said, ''It's a ghost!'' and began to scream because
they were afraid.
Another victim of the American school of translation is that great old
biblical word ''begat''. Out goes: ''And Seth lived an hundred and five
years and begat Enos'' in favour of ''When Seth was 105 years old, he
became the father of Enos.''
Finally, from the Have A Nice Day Bible, the massacre of the
Beatitudes:
Blessed are the meek.
No. Blessed are those who are gentle.
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness.
No. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for God's approval.
Blessed are the pure in heart.
No. Blessed are those whose thoughts are pure.
Blessed are the peacemakers.
No. Blessed are those who make peace.
Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall
say all manner of evil against you falsely because of me.
No. Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, lie, and
say all kinds of evil things about you because of me.
But enough of this sparkling Yankee biblical dialogue. Just wait till
they do the TV mini-series.

FARMERS who have suffered a serious shortage of grazing because of
drought should be considering supplementary feeding at grass if they
want to meet performance targets.
That is the advice from David Thornton, of Rumenco, who says farm
trials showed that high energy block supplements produced an extra 25kg
per head liveweight gain over cattle fed grass alone and the cost was
9.3p per head/day.
''This year drought conditions have resulted in a steady decline in
both quality and quantity of grass. Adjustments to stocking rates can
provide temporary respite but to maximise growth rates in beef cattle
and to ensure dairy youngstock are kept on target, supplementary feeding
is the only satisfactory alternative.

GENTLEMAN Sid can prove a bumper value bet for today's #15,000-added
Clipsal Brown Jack Stakes Handicap at Ascot, writes White and Gold.
This race always throws up a competitive field with some lively
betting exchanges and this year looks no exception.
Reg Akehurst produced Admiral's Well to win this easily last season so
his two runners, Ibsen and Chez Catalan, look sure to attract market
interest.
Highflying, Hillzah, and Art Form are all tough old stagers, while
Head Turner, runner-up in 1994, will have been targeted at this.
So Gentleman Sid, whose sole success came in a lowly maiden handicap
at Chepstow last time, should be available at a decent price.
It is true that the five-year-old didn't show much until this year but
he has been a backward sort.
He did not see a racecourse until he was three and after showing
little for Robin Dickin, joined Pat Murphy.
Murphy immediately had him gelded and that clearly has made a big
difference as Gentleman Sid's form has since made an upward curve.
He was not disgraced when seventh of 15 to Soojama at Folkestone last
month and then finished two-and-a-half lengths third to Lalindi at
Warwick.
Gentleman Sid subsequently hacked up at Chepstow, having much more in
hand than his official two-and-a-half length winning margin would
suggest.
Granted, this is a much tougher assignment. But Gentleman Sid receives
weight from all bar one of his rivals and now he his got into the
winning groove, can prove a step ahead of the handicapper.
Vindaloo gets the day's nap vote in the Daily Star Top Tipster
Handicap at Wolverhampton.
Jimmy Harris' tough three-year-old is well on course to break the
record for handicap winners in a season this century, currently standing
at nine.
He gained his seventh win in that sphere at Leicester on Wednesday
night, finishing a short-head second to Artic Courier but having had his
ground taken and being awarded the race by the stewards.
The beauty for Harris is that by switching Vindaloo back to the
all-weather, he will race off a 13lb lower mark and as the colt is still
improving that makes him something to bet on.

DARRYLL Holland and Lindsay Charnock were added to the growing list of
suspended jockeys yesterday when they were banned for seven and 10 days
respectively by the Jockey Club disciplinary committee yesterday. They
were joined later in the day by Tony Ives when he picked up a five-day
ban from the stewards at Catterick.
Holland's ban will run from Tuesday, July 25, to Monday, July 31,
while Charnock, whose ban starts on the same day, will have to sit it
out until Thursday, August 3.
Both jockeys admitted being in breach of the Jockey Club instruction,
H9, in that they had used their whips with unreasonable frequency.
The two offences were committed in separate races at Redcar last
Thursday.
Holland was on board Tu Opes, who finished a neck second to Nanton
Point in the Sea Pigeon Handicap.
Charnock incurred the wrath of the stewards for his use of the stick
on Habeta, who went down by a short head to Bulsara in the following
Langbaurgh Handicap.
Speaking at Chepstow last night, Holland said: ''Rules are rules and
that's it really. Among the decent rides I'll miss at Goodwood are Naked
Welcome in the Spitire Stakes and Celestial Key in the Schweppes Golden
Mile.''
Ives will miss the Stewards' Cup thanks to a ban imposed when he threw
away a race by dropping his hands and getting caught on the line.
The jockey looked to have the Penelope Pitstop Maiden Stakes sewn up
when he pushed well-backed 13-8 favourite Pharmacy into a clear lead
more than a furlong from home and he eased the two-year-old in the
closing stages.
When strong-finishing Gladys Althorpe -- off the bridle some way out
-- challenged in the final strides, it was too late for Ives to respond,
and his mount was beaten a head at the line.
Ives was found guilty by the stewards of failing to ride to get the
best possible placing for his mount and suspended for five days (July 29
to August 2 inclusive).
He will miss the Stewards' Cup at Goodwood a week on Saturday and the
chance to renew his partnership with Bold Effort, on whom he landed the
#39,000 William Hill Trophy at York last month.
Meanwhile, jump jockeys Martin Brennan and Carl Llewellyn both had
10-day bans reduced to four days on appeal yesterday at the same
hearing.
The pair had been suspended after the Radio Wyvern Handicap Hurdle at
Worcester last Wednesday.
Brennan, on Hallo Mam, had been found guilty of irresponsible riding
and Llewellyn, on Poetic Fancy, of intentional interference.
Llewellyn's offence was downgraded to careless riding in that he
interfered with second-placed Hallo Mam due to a misjudgment but did not
improve his own placing.
The committee decided that Brennan was guilty of irresponsible riding
in that he caused interference by attempting to pass on the inside.
The committee also decided to change the decision of the Worcester
stewards, who disqualified both horses. Having upheld the appeals, they
placed Poetic Fancy second and Hallo Mam third.
* THE line-up and quality of tomorrow's King George VI And Queen
Elizabeth Diamond Stakes remains firmly in the hands of Sheikh Mohammed.
Two of the nine runners declared at the five-day stage on Monday, the
Andre Fabre-trained pair Carnegie and Winged Love, run in the Sheikh's
silks.
And another pair, Vodafone Derby winner Lammtarra and last year's Oaks
heroine Balanchine, are set to represent the Sheikh's Godolphin set-up.
But only Lammtarra of the quartet seems certain to run at Ascot.

ALBERT EINSTEIN once deplored nationalism as the measles of mankind, a
childhood disease -- potentially fatal, terribly serious, but one
grown-ups should be able to avoid. Any student of twentieth-century
history will recognise this fundamental truth: the terrible descent into
murderous tribalism is potentially contagious.
Faced with Bosnia, how brave then is Dr Nicholas Tate, the man in
charge of the national curriculum? At first glance, very. He has
provoked a froth of indignation on the liberal left for suggesting, in
front of a gathering of head teachers no less, that the superiority of
what he calls Britishness should be taught in our schools.
His argument is that the majority culture of these islands -- European
in race, Christian in faith, English in tongue -- has been dangerously
undermined in the classroom by 30 years of moral relativism. A
generation has been taught that all cultures are equal, that all
literature, all art, all history are the same -- and is thoroughly
confused as a result.
He wants all schoolchildren, regardless of their ethnic origins, to be
taught what it means to be British. Schools should ''ensure all pupils
have the English language at the centre of their knowledge, understand
the country's history and literary heritage, study Christianity and the
classical world -- the basis of European civilisation''.
Dr Tate is, in fact, preaching a crusade against multiculturalism, the
educational theory that denigrates European civilisation, and promotes
other cultures, all in the name of fostering ''tolerance''. He thinks
tolerance comes instead from the creation of a confident majority: ''The
best guarantee of strong minority cultures is the existence of a
majority culture which is sure of itself, which signals that customs and
traditions are things to be valued and which respects other cultures.''
The multiculturalists have had a field day. Dr Tate has been accused
of right-wing extremism, of wallowing in a Kipling-inspired myth of
green-grassed Victorian England, of fostering nationalism. But the
reaction missed the kernel of sense hidden in this otherwise typically
English attempt to grapple with the issue of identity.
Dr Tate's opponents are wrong to dismiss the fundamental point he
raises: that a cultural identity is essential to the formation of every
individual, and that the education system must foster that process. In
that sense he is right to challenge the fashionable assumption that what
matters is to know a little about lots of things, rather than a lot
about the things that matter. He may not realise it, but all Dr Tate
wants is better education.
Instead he allows himself to be sidetracked by confusing cultural
identity with national identity. He says British, but means English.
It's a typical mistake, based on a failure to recognise that Britain is
an administrative term rather than a cultural one.
It is also a result of embarrassment. Our cousins south of the Border
will admit to speaking English but are often uncomfortable with the idea
of being English. But what else is the ''confident majority'' Dr Tate
speaks of but an English one? His courage does not include a willingness
to stand up and admit what he is. And there can be no doubt what that
is: only an Englishman talks about Britishness.
The rest of us know there is no such thing. Literature may be English,
but its authors are English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh.
Ditto our art, music, politics, sport, cooking, and every other
manifestation of what adds up to our culture. British serves as
shorthand to describe ourselves as citizens of the United Kingdom, and
no more.
Roseanna Cunningham, the SNP's new bi-cultural MP, faced Dr Tate on
Newsnight on Tuesday, and left him in no doubt about the weaknesses of
his argument: what he has failed to grasp is that Britain is already a
multicultural state -- English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish. She wants to
encourage the move away from nationalism based on ethnicity towards a
liberal definition based on an individual's commitment rather than
origin. In these terms you should not need to be a Scot to be Scottish.
This is a debate from which Dr Tate is excluding himself. If his
strategy is to use emotive language to provoke discussion, then he has
succeeded. But it is also sensationalist, and distracts from the
question of the standard of education currently on offer to British --
administrative term -- children.
The joke, of course, is on Dr Tate, and proves how little he has
understood how national and cultural identity in Britain are already
defined. He heads something called the School Curriculum and Assessment
Authority. Unfortunately for Dr Tate, they've never heard of it in
Scotland. His writ does not stretch to Scotland.
He may want to teach Britishness, but he'll have to do it England and
Wales.

<HEADLINE>British Coal's offer called unacceptable Pollution threat to land sale</HEADLINE>

THE relationship between British Coal and tenants who hope to buy the
farms being sold by the corporation was aggravated this week as the
conditions of the first sale offers were disclosed.
Certain of the terms look set to hinder negotiations between the
parties which had looked promising. So far agreement between potential
buyers and British Coal valuers has been reached on 35 out of the 56
properties that are for sale.
This week at a meeting of around 40 tenants, John Dale, a solicitor
from an Ayrshire-based firm representing many of the tenants, revealed
that he had spoken to the principals of the British Coal offer and found
that many of the terms were unacceptable.
The major area of contention was that the British Coal offer failed to
address the issue of pollution. The strong inference that the
responsibility for environmental pollution passes entirely to the new
owners was greeted with disbelief by tenants.
They had been under the impression that negotiations on purchase price
were based on the understanding that British Coal would be accountable
for pollution.
The predicament which responsibility for pollution would place farmers
in was highlighted by Jimmy Wilson of Lumphinans Farm, Cowdenbeath, who
said advice from one of the leading agricultural insurers indicated that
environmental pollution was not insurable.
He warned: ''We're being asked to take an extremely high risk which,
at the end of the day, could bankrupt a farm . . . this is
unacceptable.''
A further cause for concern was a condition restricting development
which would in effect restrict the use of land to agricultural purposes.
The irony of this stipulation was pinpointed by Linda Wood, New Farm,
Lochgelly, who asked: ''How can British Coal justify holding everyone to
agricultural purposes when the Government wants farmers to diversify?''
A further stumbling block was that the terms require tenants to
relinquish all their properties' mineral rights in favour of British
Coal. This was a cause for concern for David Nelson, Castlehill,
Crossgates, who predicted that farmers who buy their land might be
particularly vulnerable after the impending windup of British Coal.
He asked: ''Will there be a private successor who will be sold the
mineral rights?''
The position of the National Farmers Union on the issue was made clear
by Jim Wyllie of the union's legal and commercial committee who said:
''I am very concerned that the conditions exposed today do not appear to
address liability on potential future environmental pollution.''
He added: ''This was always one of the worries we had about tenants
agreeing to prices in principle without detailed schedules of
conditions.
''It is important that British Coal take on the responsibility for any
future pollution caused as a result of their previous coal mining
activities.''
He added: ''I am deeply disappointed that the conditions have been
silent on this issue.''
Several of the tenants' misgivings about the conditions were shared by
the representatives of the financial institutions who were present at
the meeting.
Speaking yesterday, Donald Macrae, senior manager of agricultural
services with the TSB, advised tenants to ''establish clearly where the
responsibility for pollution lies.''
Pointing out that many farms have diversified, Mr Macrae said that he
considered the restrictions on the use of land to be too severe.
He added, however, that the terms represented a ''first step'' towards
a suitable offer.
The tenants' committee is holding a meeting on Monday to further
review the situation.

THE Royal Bank of Scotland is the latest bank to join the Internet
international communications system. It is making 40 pages of
information available to an audience of 30 million and which detail the
bank's services and products.
Browsers will be able to send back their own comments on a special
feedback page as well as being able to ask for additional information.
Director of retail banking Frank Kirwan said: ''The wonderful thing
about Internet is that it's interactive, so customers and non-customers
can talk to us with just a few keystrokes.''
The bank will be looking closely at the number of responses it gets
and the reaction of potential new customers.
However, it seems likely that direct on-line banking is some way off
as there is a substantial security problem to be overcome with the risk
of hackers at present being able to gain access to accounts.

FIGURES published yesterday confirm that the value of Scottish
agricultural gross output rose in 1994 to #1819m, an increase of #99m
(6.8%).
The Agriculture in Scotland Report, published by the Scottish Office,
shows the value of the cash crop sector was up #95m, there was a #12m
rise in the livestock sector output and a #15m increase for livestock
products.
While average market prices were down for livestock, they rose for
livestock products. In the cropping sector only barley and potatoes
showed increases.
The report says: ''Most farm types saw increased income levels. The
largest increases were for general cropping, mixed and cereals farms.
The greatest fall was experienced by specialist sheep farmers.''
Cattle numbers rose by 16,000 (1%) with a reversal of recent trends in
increased dairy herd numbers. Sheep numbers fell fell by nearly 2% to
just over 9.4 million while the pig population rose 2% to over 540,000.
The poultry flock fell 2.4% to 14.6 million.
The area of set aside land rose 3000 hectares to 93,000 hectares and
the area of oilseed rape rose 16% to 70,000 hectares.

SMITH NEW Court shareholders seeking information on takeover talks
were disappointed at yesterday's annual meeting of the independent
securities house. Chairman Michael Marks started off by saying that he
was unable to make any comment on the progress of discussions with
potential suitors.
He said: ''I am sure that you will appreciate that in the current
circumstances, I have been advised that I am unable to make any further
statement on the discussions.''
Merrill Lynch of the US has emerged as the favoured suitor ahead of
Commerzbank of Germany and it had been hoped that a deal could have been
agreed before the meeting.
However, Merrill is being opposed by Rothschild chairman Sir Evelyn de
Rothschild who controls 25.9% of the SNC equity. He favours Commerzbank
of Germany as the new owner.
The Germans had promised to keep SNC as an independent entity with the
Rothschild agreement on the distribution of equities remaining intact.
Mr Marks and the majority of the SNC board favour the Americans who
are trying to persuade Sir Evelyn who is demanding the distribution will
continue.
Merrill is a large player in international equity markets and so SNC
would benefit from substantial amounts of new business that would
automatically come its way as well as being underpinned by a wealthy
parent prepared to back its expansion.
It seems probable that agreement will be reached either today or over
the weekend so that for around #500m, yet another leading British
financial institution will move into foreign hands hard on the heels of
Dresdner Bank's #1000m takeover of Kleinwort Benson and the Dutch ING
Group's rescue of Barings.

SCOTLAND appears to be suffering more of a slowdown than most of the
rest of the UK according to the latest quarterly survey of companies
from the British Chambers of Commerce.
The findings, though, are in contrast to other recent surveys which
have shown a much more positive situation, particularly with regard to
exports and output.
In the UK as a whole, the BCC said the recent slowdown in economic
growth has persisted in the second quarter.
''The figures are a warning that any further tightening of monetary or
fiscal policy could tip the economy towards the low growth scenario none
of us wants,'' said BCC president Robin Geldard. But he said that the
economy was still growing and prospects in the short to medium term
appeared to be positive.
On Scotland, the BCC said that with the balance of firms in the
service sector reporting falling sales to the home market, and orders
also falling for manufacturers, it should come as no surprise that
Scottish firms on the whole remain the most pessimistic in the UK.
It said that adding to the picture of slowing or even negative growth
in the domestic market, little solace is provided by manufacturing
exporters. Both the balances of firms reporting increased sales and
orders abroad are down, from plus 15% to plus 4% with respect to sales,
and from plus 27% to plus 2% with respect to orders.
Large firms, said the BCC, have been particularly hit over the last
quarter, their manufacturing export figures falling from a positive
balance of plus 43% to a negative one of minus 6%.
However, CBI Scotland's Lex Gold yesterday pointed to the last monthly
CBI industrial trends survey covering June which was quite positive on
Scotland. There are problems in housing and construction but this is
true everywhere.
The survey showed order books above normal for exports and the volume
of output was seen as a plus. Moreover there were indications of
inflationary pressure subsiding. Scotland was as ''healthy as
anywhere,'' said Mr Gold, and there was still an export-led recovery.
The CBI's July Quarterly Industrial Trends Survey is due on Tuesday
but it must be considered unlikely that there would have been any
dramatic deterioration in Scotland over the month.
Geoff Runcie, chief executive of the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce,
described the BCC survey findings on Scotland as ''unduly gloomy'' but
along with the general results they were aimed at the Chancellor.
He emphasised that export margins are very tight. The recovery, which
Scotland had been enjoying in contrast to the rest of the UK, is no
longer pronounced but in some areas, such as housing, Scotland had never
suffered in the first place to the extent seen in other parts of the UK.
The BCC said the balance of Scottish manufacturers reporting increased
sales is a barely positive plus 1%, from plus 3% last quarter, and the
lowest in the UK.
Future prospects for domestic sales growth look equally unfavourable,
with a figure of minus 3%, signifying that most manufacturing firms are
not seeing orders increase. Hardest hit are the larger firms, minus 7%
reporting growing order books down from plus 5% last quarter.
Along with Merseyside, Scottish manufacturers are reported as being
the only ones shedding labour. Future employment prospects in the
manufacturing sector are said to look similarly bleak though prospects
look a little brighter in the service sector.
The survey shows that investment in buildings is significantly down in
both sectors. The trend for plant and equipment investment is similar in
the service sector, though improving in manufacturing.
Earlier this week a survey from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the leading supplier
for business information, said that there had been an all-round increase
in business confidence in Scotland, which had brought it back in line
with other parts of the country.
Sales optimism was said to have increased in the same measure as it
has delined elsewhere. Moreover, as opposed to the rest of Britain, the
survey found that more Scottish firms expected to increase staff.
Economic forecaster Business Strategies also took a more positive view
of the outlook for Scotland. It said Scotland would avoid the slowdown
in growth rate predicted for the rest of the UK economy.
Business Strategies said Scotland's growth rate was forecast to
overtake that of the UK as whole by 1996. A sharp fall in unemployment
was also predicted over the next 18 months.

RYDEN, the Edinburgh-based property consultant, is continuing its
drive into emerging markets by opening new offices in Kenya and Russia.
Senior partner Jim Fiddes said Ryden will also expand its operations
in the north of England soon by opening a new office in Yorkshire. At
present, the firm's only English office is in London.
Mr Fiddes said the new offices in Nairobi and St Petersburg would both
be 50/50 joint ventures with local partners.
''These are both seed corn exercises. We would expect them to break
even very quickly, but it may take a number of years for them to show a
profit,'' he said
Besides helping inward investors to find business premises in Russia
and East Africa, Ryden also hopes to handle commercial valuations, sales
and lettings for local clients.
Mr Fiddes said the Nairobi office, which is due to open on August 1,
would be a regional centre for East Africa, handling business in Uganda
and Tanzania as well as Kenya
It will be headed by Richard Luusa, a Kenyan national who studied in
Scotland and has been working with Ryden at its Aberdeen office.
The St Petersburg office will be headed by Sean Henry, who formerly
worked for a German mortgage bank in Frankfurt and Zurich.
Ryden's other overseas offices are in New York, Prague, and
Johannesburg.
Mr Fiddes said the company had taken a strategic decision to
concentrate on developing business in Eastern Europe and Africa, where
political change was opening up new opportunities.
Ryden had deliberately steered clear of Western Europe, an established
market where competition was more intense.

<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Price Chief Executive Jim Hosea last night demanded an end to
the bitter wrangle over share dealings in the company.
He wants publication in full of a recent independent inquiry which he
is confident will endorse what Scottish Pride's board has been saying
over recent weeks about the ''innuendo which has challenged our
integrity.''
Mr Hosea, at a countrywide series of meetings which ended last night
at Ayr has said that a small group of people representing a tiny
minority of shareholders were continuing to promote unfounded claims
damaging to Scottish Pride and questioning the integrity of directors.
He asked the requisitionists how they could justify their attempt to
ask shareholders to pay for mistakes made in their campaign by seeking
reimbursement of expenses, already estimated at #20,000.
These costs do not take account of the expense incurred by Scottish
Pride in defending itself.
It is understood that the dissidents group leader Michael McCreath of
Newton Stewart is to be asked to make a public retraction when the
finding of the independent inquiry becomes available.

* WITH fuel bills significantly higher than other parts of Britain,
it's scarcely surprising Scots keep a weather eye on the electricity
meter, so a new cost-saving initiative by Hydro-Electric is welcome.
The company claims it's the first retailer in Europe to provide
point-of-sale labelling about how much energy tumble driers use.
When Hydro launched a similar initiative last year for fridges and
freezers demand for the most economic products surged.
Most stores now label fridges and freezers with easily understood
estimates of yearly running costs. John Lewis provides useful additional
information at its branches in Edinburgh and Aberdeen and comes out tops
for five-year extended cover. The second year is free and
parts-and-labour breakdown insurance (including food loss) for three
years after that is #19.50. Expect to pay up to #70 elsewhere.
* WELL worth digesting if you're a bon vivant or simply interested in
tickling the taste buds is Food Trails of Scotland, by The Herald's
regional food writer of the year Catherine Brown.
For starters, she takes a gastronomic gallop round Dumfries and
Galloway, in search of butchers, bakers, smokers, fish processors, game
dealers, and other purveyors of fine foods.
She points readers in the direction of the region's fine cheeses and
such delicacies as Castle Maclellan mushroom pate, and homely hotels and
restaurants the visitor to Scotland's South-west won't want to miss.
Food Trails No 1 is published by Hamely Fare Productions, Abbey Mill
Business Centre, Paisley, at #2.
* STRIKE-bound rail commuters defecting to the buses may have expected
to be greeted with open arms and VIP treatment to persuade them to
switch permanently. (It is, after all, a heaven-sent PR opportunity).
Not so, if the experience of some of our readers is to be credited.
Coach firm Scottish Citylink made it clear that regular customers come
first. To underline the point a card has been issued advising: ''In the
event of a rail strike this will enable the holder to identify
him/herself as a frequent user of our services, and every effort will be
made to carry them.''
A Citylink spokesman admitted ''positive discrimination'', as a reward
for loyalty. Anyone who thinks the train drivers' strike is likely to
drag on and wants to enhance the chance of a Citylink seat (between
Glasgow and Edinburgh, for example) might find acquiring frequent-user
status a smart move -- for the price of a 10-journey ticket.
What happens if everyone in the queue produces one? ''We know our
regulars,'' said the spokesman, omnibusly.
THE Queen Mother's not the only old person with eye problems -- but
the cure for thousands of deprived elderly folks in the Third World
could be hidden away at the back of a drawer. Have a rummage for any old
glasses, and take them to your nearest Dollond &amp; Aitchison branch.
The high street optician has teamed up with Help the Aged to find
300,000 pairs by the end of this month and collection points are on
standby throughout Scotland (or phone the Helpline on 0121-706 6133).
Once cleaned and graded by inmates at Parkhurst Prison, the glasses
will be shipped to victims of failing eyesight in Africa, Asia, Latin
America, and the Caribbean. Poverty, disease and poor diet mean sight
can deteriorate rapidly, leaving the elderly there unable to earn a
living without glasses.
* ONLY 150 or so shopping days left -- so hurry to Nash's, the
stationers in Miller Street, Glasgow, for half-price Christmas cards,
calendars, tree decorations and other festive favourites. The sale, in
its 35th year, continues until the end of September . . . Cleopatra

Plain bread is being reinvented, and Anna Burnside reveals how loaves
have been used to ensure its success
Oh, you canny fling pieces
out a 20-storey flat
Seven thousand hungry
weans will testify to that
If it's butter, cheese or jeely, if the bread be plain or humble
The odds against it reaching
earth are 99 tae wan.
THE VERY STUFF OF LIFE
* Approx: 1.1 million loaves are produced in Scotland each day.
* The average person eats four slices of bread each day.
* Customers can choose from over 500 lines of bread.
* Sales of white bread compared to brown: in the seventies -- 89.5% /
10.5%; eighties -- 70% / 30%; nineties -- 74% / 26%.
* The UK bread market is worth #2900m.
* The annual volume of bread baked in Britain is 2.9 million tonnes,
which is the equivalent of 9.5 million 800g loaves baked every day of
the year.
* 80% of all bread is sold wrapped and sliced.
* Bread contains carbohydrates, vitamins (especially B vitamins),
protein and calcium.
* Bread is the main source of fibre in the British diet.
* The average price of bread is 45p; the most expensive is Marks &amp;
Spencer at #1.59; the cheapest, available at discount stores, is 29p.
* The most popular brand of loaf in Britain is Hovis with a 19% share
of the branded bread market.
THE sweet voices of St Dominic's Primary Choir were giving it laldy.
Mum chucks the piece, safe in the bread's tartan wrapper, from the
window to the back green. A nosey neighbour, or is it Everygran, peeks
out of her curtains to nod approvingly. The wee lassie tears into the
sandwich and then gets back to her computer.
It could only happen in an advert -- this one is for Mother's Pride
plain bread. Come August 14, this brand is going to be reawakened,
Cinderella-like, from a long, unprofitable nap. In place of the handsome
prince's kiss will come TV and radio advertising, a smart new packaging
and a many-pronged public relations push.
We have been neglecting plain bread. We might remember it
nostalgically, fighting over the heel-ender, eating it golden and
toasted, thickly buttering it for bacon sandwiches, even having our mums
hurling it at us from the third floor, but we omit to buy it when we go
to the supermarket.
Kids brought up on plain bread now buy ciabatta; even white bread's
traditional buyers have taken to other loaves -- baguettes for a treat,
posh, repackaged sliced whites, the multi-grain breads with chew bits,
even squashy, inferior pan bread.
British Bakeries, Mother's Pride's parent company, are not happy about
this. Ten years ago, half the bread made at the company's Glasgow and
Ayr bakeries was plain. Now it is just a quarter. Just 18% of all the
white bread sold in Scotland is plain. So British Bakers have summoned
the prince of promotion to take Cinderella to the ball.
Reinventing a loaf of bread is too big a job for one person. A team of
highly trained professionals has drunk cafetiere after cafetiere of
coffee far into the night working on this one. Pulling the strings is
Alistair Brown, commercial controller of British Bakeries for Scotland.
He was appointed last year with the relaunch of Mother's Pride plain
bread as one of his key tasks. The advert was made by new Edinburgh
agency 1576 and the other publicity will emanate from Glasgow firm Flora
Martin.
One reason the brand had dozed off was, according to Brown, the
English staff had no idea how to market it or even package it. ''The
last redesign was three years ago and I felt immediately that it had
been done in England. It missed the point, it even printed the address
in Windsor. The new packaging says 'baked in Scotland, with unbleached
flour milled in Scotland'; the address on the package is in Duke Street.
The English didn't think that was important.''
Using Black Watch tartan is the finishing touch -- with unexpected
restraint, it lands the wrapper on just the right side of kitsch. Brown
calls it ''reverse trendiness'' and thinks it taps into current fashion
for things old-fashioned.
Everybody buys bread. What Brown wants us to do is include Mother's
Pride Scottish Plain in our ''repertoire''. Millions of loaves are sold
every day so he will be looking for instant results from a 30-second
splash on the screen. The target is to increase sales in the short term
by 50%, by 25% in the long term.
That's where Everygran and the Jeely Piece song comes in. Like
Kellog's Cornflakes, we all, apparently, love the taste of Mother's
Pride plain bread, or remember fondly that we do. We just don't actually
buy it. We need a clever advert to reposition the plain loaf as a piece
of living history, a slice of Scottish life. We need to feel good about
buying it, eating it, giving it to our children.
In the language of ad-land, we have sorted goodwill towards the brand.
All that's needed is a clever advert to help us translate that into our
morning toast. And #250,000, to buy enough peak-time telly to make sure
we get the message. Adrian Jeffery of 1576 explains: ''If you can tap
into truisms, something everyone can relate to, you get that added
warmth for your product, there's a feel-good factor: that happened to me
when I was a child, or if it didn't happen, I wish it had. Something
quite nice about having a sandwich thrown down to you from the third
floor by your granny.
''There is a danger that this bread gets trapped in the past. We
didn't want to trick people but we wanted to make people think that the
commercial was set in the past, with the song and so on. What we wanted
to do was bring people into now, say that bread you had when you were
little, that your mum gave to you, why don't you give it to your
children? It's a gentle nudge saying this is not a dead bread, this is a
bread that has a heritage and is very Scottish and deserves to be given
to your children and it would be sad if it died.''
If the advert is the handsome prince's kiss, the public-relations
campaign is the smoochy phone call and the long-stemmed lilies. Flora
Martin public relations officer Niamh Quinn, who toured the country with
butlers and sandwiches to promote Kingsmill, will be feeding stories to
newspapers, organising competitions, and giving away free loaves. She
has all the patter.
''We'll be helping existing users to articulate what it is about
Mother's Pride that they like. Then there's lapsed users, the ones that
had it when they were children but feel that for some reason it is not
quite nutritious enough, not the right thing to be giving their
children. We'll be concentrating on the nutrition angle.
''The Health of the Nation actually states that we should be eating
more bread, and that white bread is not necessarily worse for you than
any other kind of bread. Mother's Pride is made with unbleached flour,
so it has 35% more protein than other white bread. It is basically
nutritious.''
She will also be giving away free loaves and inviting kids and mums to
invent recipes for ''toast toppers'' to enhance a slice of Mother's
Pride. Her activities refine and reinforce the messages from the advert,
concentrating on the target buyer, a mother with two or more children
aged between nine and 13. These are the people who buy the most bread.
So Cinderella will go the ball in her tartan finery but the question
is, will she be invited back? Is nostalgia enough to bring consumers
back to a loaf which won't fit in the toaster? Once we've tried it
again, out of curiosity, will we like the taste and chewy texture enough
to try it again? Will children accustomed to the Pop-Tart and Pot Noodle
demand a return to bread and jam? One thing is certain -- you canny
fling ciabatta out a 20-storey flat.

I go to the morgue about six times a year -- it keeps me normal and
keeps me sharp
Douglas Thompson tracks down Patricia D Cornwell -- the creator of Dr
Kay Scarpetta, the Chief Medical Examiner of Richmond, Virginia -- a
woman opening up the once male-dominated detective genre
SHE is late thirtysomething with neat, quiet, blonde hair which spills
over towards her knowing blue eyes which have witnessed rather more than
most of us want to see. But like to read about.
Patricia D Cornwell is the Agatha Christie of the DNA age, an American
thriller writer who, with a handful of novels and a Hollywood-headed
heroine, now rivals Ruth Rendell and P D James for the patent on
worldwide bestseller lists. The paperback version is her prize-winning
The Body Farm (Warner Books, Sterling #5.99, published July 6) which
will hit British bookstores in the next few days. W H Smith plan special
promotions.
The book trade perceives her as a ''star'' and an essential for the
holiday beaches. Like Thomas Harris, the creator of Hannibal ''The
Cannibal'' Lecter, she is a pathologist of all that is evil. But rather
than getting inside her killers' minds, her detection all develops from
the slab.
The Morgue. That is the precint of Dr Kay Scarpetta, the Chief Medical
Examiner of Richmond, Virginia, which by no coincidence is the home town
of her creator. (There's also a home for Cornwell out on the Coast in
Malibu but that's just a little perk for the rapidly-becoming,
most-popular crime novelist in the world). Her publishers call her books
''scalpel sharp'' and there's some merit in that.
But what Cornwell is doing is using today's forensic science
breakthroughs to rework and revitalise the page-turning crime novel.
Scarpetta is Chandleresque in that she's independent, honest and
dedicated.
But she is also human, and has emerged as the leader in the now
testosterone-free zone of crime writing.
Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone, Sara Paretsky's VI Warshawski, Linda
Barnes' Carlotta Carlyle and Cornwell's Scarpetta are the 1990s
inheritance of the hardboiled men like Dashiell Hammett and Chandler
and, later, Ross MacDonald and Robert B Parker.
But the gender doesn't mean they are soft-boiled.
Cornwell's Scarpetta, the self-reliant, somewhat lonely character has
captured readers' imaginations and a string of awards including 1993's
Golden Dagger Award for the best crime novel of the year from the
British Crime Writers Association. It was only five years ago that
Cornwell won a record five awards for Best First Crime Novel for Post
Mortem. She credits her success to hard work and attention to detail.
Her sleuth works from information not instincts. There's a touch of
Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot but not much of Miss Marple. The
violence, often gory in the post-mortem aftermath, is tangible.
Cornwell, a soft-spoken chatterbox, says: ''If Agatha Christie were
alive she would be writing the same stuff as me -- but she would blow me
off the map. She loved the technical stuff but in her day there wasn't
much of it and in any event women didn't have access to it. Dr Scarpetta
couldn't have happened 20 years ago -- it would have been science
fiction if she had.''
And ''Patsy'' Cornwell is interested in facts. That's how her career
began. She was a police reporter for the Charlotte Observer in North
Carolina, a life of running her eyes over police blotters, and her legs
after ambulances, before she became involved in writing the biography of
evangelist Billy Graham's wife Ruth, A Time For Remembering.
In preparation for Post Mortem she offered to do volunteer work for
the Medical Examiner's office in Richmond. She liked it. Six years later
she was still working as a computer analyst: ''I was so fascinated by
what I saw. And I took it very seriously.''
More than 500 post mortems and just as many scene-of-the-crime
investigations later she produced her first novel. It also called on her
experience as a volunteer police officer, training at the FBI Academy in
Quantico, Virginia, and detailed studies of landmark forensic trials.
Not surprisingly the hook for readers was the inside knowledge, the
ghoulish bits.
But Cornwell did not rest in the velvet coffin of fame. ''I still go
to the morgue about six times a year and take car rides out with the
police at night. It keeps me normal and it also keeps me sharp.''
And therefore keeps Dr Kay Scarpetta at the cutting edge. ''She is a
fabulous moral force and I feel safe walking through this world with
her. I don't think you could tolerate what is in the books if you were
not walking with her. She is a sort of embodiment of humanity,
rationality and enlightenment in a world that is dark.
''She is a woman of very deep feelings but she doesn't wear them on
her sleeve. She's reserved as she has to be to do all she has to every
day. The thing that is wonderful about Scarpetta is that the only weapon
she has is her mind. She doesn't go around hitting people or getting
into bar-room brawls.
''Her weapon is her enlightenment, her intelligence which is where the
technology, the science and the medicine comes in. These are the tools
of her trade but the real struggle is on a very spiritual level. She is
a force for morality surrounded by evil people and she cannot become
bitter or diminished by them.''
Cornwell and Scarpetta (''my outside influence,'' says the author)
believe in capital punishment. Certainly, the horrors presented in Post
Mortem, Body of Evidence, All That Remains and Cruel and Unusual (all
available in paperback) could weigh the scales of opinion.
Cornwell, 39, divorced from an English college professor who became a
Presbyterian minister in Virginia, is, she says at her London hotel,
happy with her present life. With publishing conquered, her only hurdle
now is in Hollywood.
Tinseltown sees Dr Kay Scarpetta as a winner. But they also thought
that about Kathleen Turner as V I Warshawski.
Patricia Cornwell in her few years as a best-selling author -- she's
done for formaldehyde what John Grisham has done for the law -- has
become a wily negotiator.
Demi Moore wanted to star in the movie version of Cruel and Unusual
and there was also word that Moore's husband Bruce Willis was interested
in the role of Scarpetta's friend and confidante, the world-weary cop
Pete Marino.
But the creator of one of crime fiction's most popular characters
couldn't see Moore in the role. She thought someone older, less
pneumatic, might be the answer.
''I've heard all the perils of Hollywood and books and, luckily, I was
in a position not to have to say Yes to whatever they offered. I want to
get the right person to play her and it doesn't have to be a big name.
''She has such a following I think that people would be upset or at
least disappointed if I just took any Hollywood deal and left them to
it. I really wanted to be involved. I know people have said that before.
I mean it.
''Kay Scarpetta wouldn't exist without me.''

Srinagar, Thursday
KASHMIRI militants holding two Britons among five Western hostages
said talks with Indian officials had broken down.
The Al-Faran group, in its first statement since a deadline for
killing the captives expired on Monday, said it would carry out its
death threat if Indian forces tried to search for them.
''Al-Faran no longer has contact with the Government of India,'' the
group said. ''Those nations which have appealed to us to release the
hostages should press the Indian Government to fulfil our demands and
tell them not to follow our freedom fighters. This could lead to the
hostages being killed any time.''
The captives, including Britons Paul Wells and Keith Mangan, have been
held for two weeks.--Reuter.

IN his latest bitter tirade against the modern police service, John R
Stephen once more torpedoes his own case by peppering it with blatant
falsehoods, misconceptions and some prime red herrings, while pointedly
failing to address the original points at issue, those of the quality of
modern policing and the iniquitous Sheehy recommendations (July 19).
His reference to a ''well-thumbed register of jobs for retiring
officers is almost laughable were he not being serious, as also is his
view that employers prefer ex-police officers as failure to behave
renders their police pensions liable to forfeit.
The pension does not depend in any way on the subsequent industrial
behaviour of the pensioner, and no register of jobs exists, or has ever
existed.
Mr Stephen advances his ancestors' collective policing experience as
qualifying him to comment on modern policing affairs. My own equivalent
ancestors were professional soldiers and farmworkers, but I would not
have the temerity to use this as a qualification to criticise either the
UN Command in Bosnia or the Common Agricultural Policy.
The existence of a maternal relative who chaired the Scottish Police
Federation in 1933-34 is barely, if at all, relevant to a discussion
about policing in the modern era.
Incidentally, the published lists of former Secretaries of the
Scottish Police Federation contain no such name as Rothney. Misprint or
more misinformation? Please tell us, Mr Stephen.
It would be nice also if Mr Stephen would tell us exactly what his own
police service was. It is patently obviously to any wideawake reader
that he himself is an ex-police officer.
If he is a police pensioner, who is benefiting from the self-same
pension conditions which he berated in his last but one letter, then his
conduct puzzles me. Truly this is a turkey voting for Christmas when he
advocates drastic changes to the pension scheme.
Of course, he may be an ex-police officer without a pension, which may
go some way to explain his bitter attitude to his former employment.
Whether pensioned or not, it would be more helpful to your general
readership if he had indicated how long his service was and, more
important, when his last experience of traditional beat policing was.
My last experience was as recently as today (July 19); when was Mr
Stephen's? He did not tell us, despite having many an opportunity to do
so. Accidental omission or calculated misinformation?
This is positively my last rising to Mr Stephen's bait. Doubtless he
will seek to have what is most important to him, the last word. Perhaps,
having lost the argument with Fred Casely (June 2), Hamish Tod (various
dates), and myself, Mr Stephen will resist the temptation to peddle
further tales of misinformed nostalgia, and will put this dead horse,
well-flogged as it is, back into its cupboard.

PERHAPS it was outwith the remit of his feature on Isandlwana and
Rorke's Drift (Weekender, July 15) that Derek Douglas made no reference
to the death in Natal on June 1, 1879, of Napoleon Eugene Louis Jean
Joseph, only child of the then deceased Napoleon III and the Empress
Eugenie, exiled in England since the revolutionary events of 1870, and
whom many Frenchmen regarded as the future Napoleon IV, hope of the
Third Empire.
A brilliant military student at Woolwich, the 23-year-old Prince
Imperial in face of fierce opposition by Disraeli persuaded the British
Government to allow him passage to South Africa solely as an observer
along with military reinforcements in the wake of the defeat at
Isandlwana.
On the June morning of his death the headstrong prince, acting against
strict orders, rode out with Lieutenant Carey, six troopers and a Kaffir
guide, to inspect a camp-site.
While resting the horses and at coffee the prince's small party came
under fire from a larger concentration of Zulus hidden in the donga.
Unable to remount his alarmed and naturally mettlesome grey which
galloped off, the prince, standing by the stabbed bodies of two troopers
and armed with a revolver, faced 14 Zulus. His naked and abused body was
found later in the day by a cavalry patrol.
News reached Britain three weeks later in a dispatch to Queen Victoria
from Capetown. In her diary at Balmoral dated June 20 she recorded: ''A
bad, restless night, haunted by this awful event, seeing those horrid
Zulus constantly before me.''
Queen Victoria, in mutal widowhood a dear friend to Empress Eugenie,
caused a rough stone cross to be erected over the temporary grave below
Itelemi Hill before embalmment and return to England of the prince's
body.
The following April, escorted by a strong contingent of the Natal
Mounted Police, Empress Eugenie, who was to die as late as 1920, made a
pilgrimage to the site in the company of General Sir Evelyn Wood.
That inveterate traveller, H V Morton, poignantly captured the
emotional scene as she knelt beside her son's grave. ''It must have
seemed to her,'' he wrote, ''that the glittering adventure begun so long
ago in Corsica, had ended forever in this lonely grave in Zululand,
slain by the assegai of a black Napoleon.''
Was it a mere whimsy of the Montrose family that a small lithograph of
the Prince Imperial hangs, or indeed used to, on a corridor wall at
Brodick Castle, or is there some deeper association?

MOST fair-minded people will question the vagaries of a legal system
which allowed Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, quite legitimately,
to disregard a ruling made against it by an industrial tribunal earlier
this year.
The facts of the case are that in 1993 the university dismissed Mrs
Sheena Falconer from her position as senior textile lecturer, claiming
that her job was redundant. Mrs Falconer claimed unfair dismisal and the
industrial tribunal which heard her complaint agreed that she had been
unfairly dismissed, awarded her #41,000 compensation, and ordered the
unversity to reinstate her in employment as a senior lecturer.
The university, however, chose to exploit a loophole in the law --
which has since been closed -- and ''got away'' with claiming that it
was not practicable to re-employ her and offering a final settlement at
the maximum amount which could be enforced under statute; that is,
#15,530 instead of the #41,000 which was awarded.
But there is one aspect of this case and many hundreds of others which
should cause us all concern, namely the derisory level of compensation
which is actually paid to many employees who, after giving years of
loyal and dedicated service to their employers, are made redundant.
Mrs Falconer had been employed by Robert Gordon for 27 years and was,
at the time of her redundancy, earning #32,000 a year. When you are made
redundant you get a week's pay for every year employed so, with 27
years' service and a salary of #615 a week, she was entitled to a
redundancy payment of about #16,600. What she actually got was #4715.
Why? Under current legislation, employers are only obliged to take
service up to 20 years and earnings up to #210 per week into account
when calculating redundancy payments. They can further restrict payment
to half-a-week's pay in respect of any full year's service below the age
of 18, although this increases to one-and-a-half-week's pay for any such
service over the age of 41.
The figure of #210 per week, however, was not introduced until 1994
and, in Mrs Falconer's case, her redundancy payment was calculated
against the previous (1992) level of #205. So, at the age of 47, with 27
years' service and a final salary of #32,000, her legal entitlement to a
redundancy payment was 23 weeks at #205 per week. Or, to put it another
way, the equivalent of about 7[1/2] weeks at her normal salary rate.
When legislation to make payments to redundant employees was
originally introduced, the Government operated a redundancy fund under
which employers could reclaim a portion of the redundancy payments made
to employees.
Successive governments were, consequently, keen to hold the statutory
amount of a week's pay at a low level in order to keep the cost of
rebates from the redundancy fund down.
But since these rebates have now been abolished, the Government's
continued interest in keeping the legislated amount of a week's pay low
-- currently about #100 per week less than the average UK salary -- must
be questioned.
No wonder we read every day of redundancies here, there, and
everywhere. At a maximum statutory level of 30 weeks at #210 per week,
the most an employer is legally obliged to pay in redundancy payments to
any employee is #6300 and many employees are, obviously, entitled to
much less. So redundancy is, effectively, an extremely cheap option open
to any employer who wants to cut costs and/or increase profits.
Certainly, employers also have to give redundant employees due notice,
but as the maximum notice the law demands is 12 weeks -- which the
company can require the employee to work -- this can be a no-cost
exercise.
In other words, employers can decide when they want an employee to
finish and, providing that the intervening period between advising the
employee of redundancy and the actual termination date is at least equal
to the amount of statutory notice due, the employer simply has to pay
the salary that would have been paid anyway during the relevant period.
This situation is one which should concern us all, because it is one
from which none of us is ultimately immune. Given today's economic
climate and a system which almost seduces employers into shedding staff
at the first sight of a glich in the trading figures, few of us have
much security beyond our next salary cheque, irrespective of how senior
our position within the organisation or how long we have been employed.
Take Mrs Falconer as a case in point. She was a senior lecturer of 27
years' standing who was earning #32,000 a year but got a redundancy
payment of only #4715 when she was made redundant.
Had legislation existed which allowed her full service and salary to
be taken into account, her redundancy payment, based on a week's pay for
each year of service, would have amounted to #16,605, or over #1000 more
than the compensation for unfair dismissal she has finally been forced
to accept.
Perhaps if legislation for more equitable redundancy and compensation
awards had existed the managers of Robert Gordon University would not
have taken the easy option but would have applied their minds to finding
a more creative solution to their financial problems and the fact of Mrs
Falconer's ''redundancy'' might not have arisen.

THE research group Lifestyle at Work has recommended total smoking
bans at work to stop smokers having the temerity to take a smoke break
during their working day (July 17).
I have calculated that I drink about 10 cups of coffee a day. In order
to make that coffee, I need to walk to the office kitchen and use the
coffee percolator. The whole process takes six minutes and 30 seconds. I
did not need to fund an expensive research group such as Lifestyle at
Work to find this out; I timed myself.
I therefore ''waste'' nearly five and a half hours of company time a
week making coffee. Clearly, my coffee drinking should be banned
immediately and I should be disciplined if found loitering in the office
kitchen.
As for my periodic visits to the lavatory, I shall leave the readers
of your newspaper to decide, but under the criteria set by this
preposterous survey the time I take in the lavatory would probably be a
sackable offence.
While the people who pay their taxes to Thamesdown Council wonder
whether their hard-earned money should be spent on absurd and
unnecessary research, I will continue to drink my coffee, read a
newspaper, and smoke a periodic cigarette at work.
I will chat to my colleagues, share a joke, and speak to a friend over
lunch. I will also leave the office each day knowing that I have done a
good and useful day's work, and at the same time have been treated by my
employer like a human being not a machine.

WHEN will we see the end of this racist/anti-racist problem in this
country?
If Sir Paul Condon had said that 80% of London's muggers were Jews,
Roman Catholics, or Protestants, I doubt if anyone would have even
raised an eyebrow.
I presume that at least 90% if not all of those mentioned by Sir Paul
were born in this country and therefore claim to be British citizens. As
such, they must abide by the laws of this country, irrespective of their
colour or creed.
A week or so ago in a case of rape the police said that they were
looking for a white man. No one complained about this ''racist'' remark.
Why?

I MUCH enjoyed reading the article in Weekender (July 15) about the
tough experiences of John Masefield off Cape Horn a century ago.
I feel that some of your readers would be interested to hear of the
experiences of my Glasgwegian grandfather J A Walker, at the time when
he was apprentice on the barque Elginshire in 1903.
This vessel took so many days in trying without success to round the
Horn that her crew threatened mutiny and her master responded by giving
up the attempt to sail from east to west.
Instead he took his ship across the South Atlantic then over the
Indian Ocean, then across the Pacific to San Fransisco. The Elginshire
was 273 days at sea without any sort of break. My grandfather was aged
13 or 14!

TODAY'S London conference on Bosnia has been asked by the Shadow
Foreign Secretary to provide ''a fresh start'' in the West's attempt to
keep the peace. It is hard to see what it could consist of, though a
fresh beginning to the former Yugoslav republic's suffering could emerge
if the United States Congress votes to end the arms embargo on the
Bosnia Muslims. As the Foreign Secretary himself made clear on his
return from Washington yesterday such a change would precipitate a UN
withdrawal, the consequences of which would be incalculable. The
consequences of the alternative French policy of greatly augmenting the
garrison of Gorazde, the next safe haven to be threatened by assault,
might not be significant unless the Bosnian Serbs did choose to attack
it. In that case massive air strikes would be ordered, and peacekeeping
might pass straight into war-making.
Everything in this latter case depends on the Bosnian Serbs actually
attacking Gorazde. British intelligence thinks this is unlikely. Trying,
safely and permanently, to replenish Sarajevo may be another matter. The
ability to deploy the Rapid Reaction Force lends a distinct new edge to
allied power but what it could cut is what was called ''escalation''
during the Vietnam war, the very memory of which so systematically
informs American policy.
It is always tempting to hope for, and even identify, positive fresh
developments in this perplexing and ugly war, but the pattern which has
now run for three years still seems fixed. The Bosnian Serbs maintain
their advance relentlessly while being careful to defer as much as
possible to Western threats to use their superior air power. That
power's real weight can only be felt when in combination with land
forces. Until the French proposals, and the arrival of the Rapid
Reaction Force, that combination had not really been available to the
UN. It now is, and great care will be needed to prevent it leading to
war. No doubt this is the sort of outcome that will be deliberated upon
today. The balance of choice would still lie with a diplomatic effort to
arrange a settlement but the policy of ethnic cleansing makes that look
more than ever academic. The populations which are being forcibly
relocated now are not readily going to return. Those most gloomy about
Bosnia's prospects have been proved right for three years: no new fact
challenges that pessimism today.

''BEAT this for value,'' wrote Katie Wood (Weekender, July 15) of Aer
Lingus's new #59 return fare between Glasgow and Dublin.
Easy. Ryanair provide a Prestwick to Dublin return for #49 with a #5
return rail travel to Prestwick from any point in Scotland or #5 for a
week's car parking.
Nobody would say either of these deals is bad value but it is
disappointing to see Aer Lingus's deal being touted in The Herald as the
best when that is factually incorrect.
On a more contentious note, I wonder if Aer Lingus would have
reintroduced jet equipment on their Glasgow service had it not been for
the competitive effect of Ryanair's presence.
I also wonder whether the #59 fare Aer Lingus now offer could be
offered at all without the presence of EC ''assistance'' in their
operations (a money-pot from which independent operators like Ryanair
are excluded).

AN Orkney postwoman who was unfairly sacked is to get compensation of
more than #17,000. Mrs Vivienne Wilson was fired from her job in August
1993 after she delivered unstamped monthly accounts to her husband's
business customers.
An industrial tribunal ruled that she had been unfairly dismissed but
the Post Office failed to reinstate her. Yesterday, the tribunal ordered
the Royal Mail to pay Mrs Wilson, 37, a basic award of #1690, the
statutory maximum compensation of #11,000 for the unfair dismissal, and
an additional #4394 for failure to comply with the reinstatement order.

THE latest evidence of our economic health contained in the quarterly
survey published by the British Chambers of Commerce contains the
unmistakable warning that the economy is poised between further, but
hardly dramatic, growth and stagnation. The balance could be decisively
tipped by fresh moves to tighten monetary or fiscal policy. Further
fiscal tightening is unlikely. The Chancellor keeps telling his
colleagues that it is too soon to count on any slackening of his fiscal
stance until public borrowing is under more evident control; but any
fiscal changes which do emerge in the next 18 months are certain to
produce some slackening, in other words lower taxes on income, even if
the reduction is modest and might even be dismissed as cosmetic.
Monetary policy could be tightened yet, however. The Chancellor is
still having to fight off the Governor of the Bank of England who seems
less impressed by the evidence of a general economic slowdown than by
the signs of burgeoning inflation in the latest earnings figures and by
the need to anticipate the effects of the huge cash inflows to the
economy over the next two years from the changes in train in the
building society movement. These might just arrive in time to boost any
effect delivered by tax reductions, including the psychological effect
of encouraging more consumer spending from the savings accumulated
during the years when the confidence to spend has been lacking.
Scots will have another reason for worrying about the Chambers'
findings, for this economy is the only part of the whole where
manufacturing still seems to be shedding labour (as the latest news from
Tate and Lyle at Greenock serves to confirm). Yet Scotland contributed
half the country's total fall in unemployment in the figures just
released for last month -- the shift from manufacturing to services is
still obviously in train here. Such contradictory trends are part of the
evidence which supports belief that future developments could easily
tilt in either direction to more growth or stagnation. In that case Mr
Clarke should continue to prevent interest rates rising; and to hope
that he might even be able to reduce them in the autumn.

THE Government's decision to sack Mr James Hann, the chairman of
Scottish Nuclear, on grounds of age is astonishing, at least in the
explanation proffered for the decision. In general, 62 hardly seems old,
and in particular Mr Hann seems remarkably fit and healthy -- and says
so with conviction. This complaint embodies an element of the
ridiculous. Mr Hann is not too old, just too independently minded and
outspoken in opposing policies of which he disapproves as damaging to
the nuclear electricity industry and Scottish Nuclear in particular.
His role in opposing the way in which the Scottish nuclear industry
was to be structured after privatisation was no doubt resented by Mr
Lang, then Scottish Secretary, who still is deeply involved in the
forthcoming privatisation, though now at the DTI. It is always difficult
for the heads of public concerns to serve their political masters while
maintaining their own integrity and ability to speak openly about the
proper strategy for the development of enterprises for which they have
responsibility. Mr Hann's unusually outspoken role probably proved too
much, certainly was too public, for the politicians, but their manner of
dealing with him is devious rather than direct and must only invite
contempt.
It would have been better to have said that Mr Hann's views and his
appreciation of his role at Scottish Nuclear were incompatible with the
Government's. In such a direct clash there can only be one outcome,
though Scottish public opinion would have preferred a different one. As
it is the Scottish voice on the new nuclear electricity industry has
been abruptly reduced. This is not what was expected when Mr Lang
changed jobs, nor what he pledged himself to work for. It looks a mean
and petty decision whose rationalisation is unacceptable.

JUST over a week ago I received a copy of Scottish Nuclear's annual
report along with a hand-written note from the company's chairman, James
Haan. ''People are finding it interesting,'' he wrote, ''that this has
been achieved in the public sector.'' The achievement in question was
''the most successful year in the history of a UK nuclear generating
company''.
Now he has been shown the door. In these circumstances I trust it is
not a breach of confidence to quote his informal aside to the impressive
annual report, for it is not a bad epitaph on his contribution to
Scottish Nuclear and, by extension, the Scottish economy.
People were entitled to ''find it interesting that this had been
achieved in the public sector'', for it gave yet another lie to the
sustained campaign of vilification which is conducted by mean-minded
Tories against every piece of successful, efficient, and socially
responsible public enterprise. To justify the doctrine of greed, they
must at the same time demean and diminish that which it is intended to
replace.
James Haan was not a mindless cheerleader for privatisation and that
explains why he had to go. It would be over-egging the pudding to claim
him as an opponent of nuclear privatisation. But when confronted with
the prospect of a public sector Scottish Nuclear being submerged into a
privatised UK Nuclear, the least that can be said is that he was
perceived as insufficiently zealous in the Government's cause.
On Wednesday ''they'' in general and Ian Lang in particular took their
revenge for the resistance shown by James Haan when the fate of Scottish
Nuclear was first announced. The appointed hatchet man is a Mr John
Robb, brought in from outside the nuclear industry after a career in
boardrooms which were conspicuous for their generosity towards the Tory
party.
But political approval was required and was freely given by Ian Lang.
That will be remembered and placed on the final charge sheet. Mr Lang
may have left the Scottish Office behind, but he still has to face a
Scottish electorate.
As chairman of the embryonic UK Nuclear, Mr Robb has already acquired
a reputation in the industry as a bull in a power station, more
interested in lecturing than in listening. The point is, however, that
his job really has little to do with the generation of nuclear power. It
is all about pushing through privatisation in the shortest possible
time, for the convenience of the Tories' tax-cutting intentions.
Everything else flows from that objective and the timetable which it
demands. It is less than a year since nuclear privatisation returned to
the political agenda, having previously been spurned by the City. The
only factor which brought it back was the depth of the Tory plight. They
need the money which only large-scale privatisations can raise, and
nuclear is one of the few that is available.
It has absolutely nothing to do with what is best for the country or
even the industry. As for the tax payer, he and she will be left to pick
up the vast and unquantifiable bills for decommissioning the old Magnox
stations which, this time around, are being excluded from the sale to
make it acceptable to investors.
The biggest nuclear problem facing the Tories is the requirement for
sites to be relicensed by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and Her
Majesty's Pollution Inspectorate. Some of them will, because of the
Magnox factor, be divided between public and private ownership. There is
simply no way that this immense task can or should be undertaken within
the timescale allowed by the privatisation process.
But equally, there is no way ministers intend to allow such
considerations to stand in the way of their fund-raising ambitions.
These inspectorates were pressured into professing that the work could
be accomplished within a year. They are now, along every step of the
way, being pushed by the Government to get the rubber stamps ready in
time. It is an appalling way to deal with this of all industries.
What the Tories need at every level of the process are hard men who
will brook no obstructions. Hence the appointment of Mr Robb and now of
Bob Hawley, the privatisation-obsessed chief executive of Nuclear
Electric, to the same post in the new company. The idea of Mr Hawley
trooping up to board meetings in Edinburgh for very long is worth only a
hollow laugh.
Mr Hawley is the architect of Scottish Nuclear's submersion, for the
simple reason that Nuclear Electric needs Scottish Nuclear to be
saleable. Many of Nuclear Electric's stations have been run above their
capacity and now have to go out of service for lengthy periods. The City
needs the inbuilt reassurance of Scottish Nuclear, which has the best
performance record of any generator.
It may sound melodramatic to suggest that the Tories will stop at
nothing in their determination to privatise the nuclear industry and
raise the resultant #2500m or so. But, as well as railways, look at
their record on Powergen and National Power, where they shamelessly
conned investors by failing to tell them about the nuclear plans or the
Littlechild review -- an action which has brought the British financial
system into international disrepute and from which many ramifications
are yet to flow.
This is the ruthless, high-stakes game to which Scottish Nuclear in
general and James Haan in particular have fallen victim. The abiding
criticism of them must be that they were guilty of naivety when they too
courted privatisation, in the fond belief -- equally ruthlessly snatched
away from them -- that it could be a cosy little Scottish privatisation.
The big game plan did not allow for that.
Incidentally, silly people who believe that nationality matters might
note that James Haan comes from Southampton, James Robb from Edinburgh,
and Ian Lang from Ayrshire. I know which one I think has served Scotland
best.

Milan, Thursday
FORMER Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said today that he had
sold a 20% stake in his vast television and advertising empire to an
international consortium.
The businessman turned politician told a packed news conference that
he also aimed to float a chunk of his Mediaset company on the Milan,
London, and New York stock exchanges, cutting his own stake in it to
35-40% by the end of next year.
A further 20% of Mediaset, which controls three commercial television
stations and the advertising company Publitalia, will be bought by a
group of Italian and foreign institutional investors later this year, he
added.
The consortium comprises German media magnate Leo Kirch, Saudi Prince
al-Waleed bin Talal, and the Dutch Nethold/Richemont group controlled by
South African businessman Johann Rupert.
Since he powered into politics last year, Berlusconi has come under
heavy criticism from political opponents over the question of conflict
of interest between his business and political ambitions.
The self-made billionaire has long promised to resolve this problem by
selling a majority stake in his Mediaset company, and Berlusconi carried
out lengthy negotiations with a number of potential business partners,
including Australian-born media baron Rupert Murdoch.
Berlusconi said talks with Murdoch broke down when he insisted on
taking full control of Mediaset.
''It didn't seem to be in the interests of the country to give total
control of our firm to a foreign group,'' Berlusconi said, adding
however that talks with Murdoch were continuing and that their
relationship was excellent.

Mary Brennan meets the new director of the CCA, who is determined to
take the arts venue back to its roots
I want people to be aware of what we are, and that we are different,
exciting, challenging
IT was a good question. ''CCA -- what's that stand for?'' Scrabbling
for the taxi fare, I replied: ''Centre for Contemporary Arts.'' ''Oh
aye,'' said the driver. ''And what's that, when it's at home?'' Minutes
later I was inside, putting more or less the same question to Penny Rae,
who took over as CCA director in June.
One of the first things you discover about Penny Rae, however, is that
she has more questions on the tip of her tongue than anyone else.
Livelier questions. Ever-so-nicely-put but seriously disruptive
questions. Questions that don't necessary have absolute, clear-cut
solutions but which raise crucial issues about the nature of
contemporary art, and the part that the centre has to play in its
on-going evolution.
Luckily she's keen on listening. ''I needed to get a feel of things. I
wanted to know what CCA was -- a building, or a concept? Did it mean
just the programme of exhibitions, performances and events, or was it
something bigger -- more far reaching -- than that. There's a very
young, very committed staff here and I wanted to know what they thought.
So I started off by having individual discussions with them. Asking them
how they saw the identity of CCA, where they saw it going, their part in
that and what it meant to them.''
While she was mulling over the in-house responses, Rae set about
making contacts within the wider community. At the back of her mind was
an image of ''lost people''. Members of the public who had never got as
far as the front door of the centre let alone bought a ticket for a show
or a coffee in the cafe. That image was partly coloured by wonderful
memories of an exhibition -- from those late eighties, Third Eye days --
which focused on the local life of Garnethill.
''We've lost our demographic society slightly,'' she says candidly but
her smile suggests that remedial action is in the pipeline.
Already there have been useful meetings with representatives from
different ethnic groups and societies. One conversation stopped a good
intention from misfiring like a damp squib. ''I'd been looking closely
at our print material and thinking 'Should we have translations?' Maybe
some form of welcome? Something to show we recognised these groups as
part of our society.''
This wasn't expedient tokenism. Several times, as she talks of her
hopes for the CCA, or refers back to other work experiences, Penny Rae
expresses a vehement opposition to inequalities of opportunity, whatever
the context. If language was a way of shifting the apparent barrier
between CCA and local ethnic communities then it was a case of pass the
phrase book!
''But people who knew, said 'No'. A few words of welcome wouldn't have
made much difference if everything else was in English -- apparently 90%
of our Chinese community don't even have English as a second language.''
But that same conversation had more to teach her. ''We happen to have
a poster on the cafe wall, to do with some past exhibition, and it was
of a woman in full Chinese dress. Really traditional costume. I was
chatting with someone from one of the Chinese women's projects and she
just stopped, pointed at it and said, 'Look. That's the image you're
giving of Chinese society to anyone coming into this building'.''
As the irony of it resurfaces -- Glasgow's cutting-edge arts venue,
totally behind the times as far as this Chinese woman was concerned --
Penny Rae simply has to laugh. ''It's just one of those things. It
stares you in the face, and you don't notice it.
''But you need these things to happen, if you're going to grow, if
you're going to go on learning. And that's very much what I want for me.
It's what I hope is going to happen as part of this job.''
Wouldn't you know, of course, that she almost didn't apply. ''I'd
always been a great fan of Third Eye when I was in Scotland, and I there
was an energy here that was really intoxicating. But I just thought, 'I
haven't got this exact experience. I haven't got the knowledge of
running a building of this size, this complexity before'.''
But doing a mental run through of her CV to date, nudged her into
thinking more positively about the skills and the knowledge she had to
offer.
In some ways she sees her arrival at CCA almost as a coming home. She
has, after all, worked in Scotland before. ''I was the first dance
officer appointed by the Scottish Arts Council, and that was 1985.'' Rae
recalls it as being a very exciting time, a move towards validating
dance as an art form in itself, not as a hinge to drama or some other
genre.
After three years, during which time there was a cheering flourish of
activity -- the start of dance artists-in-residence schemes and the
emergence of a community dance movement -- Rae shifted south. A stint
with the Northern School of Contemporary Dance (in Leeds) put her in
closer touch with the aims and needs of local Afro-Caribbean
communities. From there she went to Humberside.
Regional dance agencies were coming into being and Rae had a practical
grasp, as well as an ideological vision, of how dance could be developed
and encouraged in ways that were relevant to those living in the area.
It was an understanding much sought after by the new organisations.
''That was quite an important time for me, personally. I was going
back to where I was born and brought up. I had small children of my own
by then, and I could show them places that were special, that were part
of my growing up.''
Just as they were getting settled, however, they were uprooted. The
British Council invited Rae to take her expertise -- and her family --
to Zimbabwe.
''It followed on, really, from work that I'd been doing in Leeds and
elsewhere.People had been very keen to encourage artists and communities
to explore their traditional roots, find their cultural heritage,
connect with it. But very often kids were coming up and saying that what
they wanted to make work about was the inner city, the dole queue, those
kind of issues that were common all across society.
''In Zimbabwe, the questions were essentially the same. When you look
at a young contemporary artist, should you be looking at them in terms
of cultural heritage? At their context, background, nationality, colour,
sex? Or should you be looking at them, at who they are, and what they
want to say?''. As Rae charts these delicate areas of culture and
ethnicity it is clear why it was right that she applied for -- and got
-- the job at CCA.
Rae is a small, fine-boned, bright-eyed lady with a light, melodious
voice. Pass her in the foyer, when she's in jeans, hair in a hasty
topknot, and she looks like a sassy teenager. But when she talks of her
time in Zimbabwe, her innate passion for the arts, for self-expression
and true ease of access is matched and underpinned by a quick and
insatiably curious intelligence. She absorbs information instinctively,
but not passively.
Her work in Zimbabwe affected her profoundly. When she returned to
Britain it was with a refocused sense of those things that truly
mattered to her and why. ''I also had a sense of frustration.
Intolerance, actually. And it left me wondering if I could go back to
working in the arts. I'd hear people complaining that they weren't
getting enough money, enough nurturing, enough support and I'd think 'My
God! You're getting an incredible amount' and, compared to what I'd come
from, they were.
''I came to feel it would be unfair to put these frustrations -- which
were very personal -- on to the situation as it existed here.''
She was convinced that her future lay in aid work when she gradually
got sucked back into the arts scene through doing a research consultancy
for Scottish Ballet.
Six weeks into her new role as director of CCA and she has definite
plans. An absolute priority is upgrading the building to provide
disabled access. Programming for PS2 -- the upstairs space -- makes her
vastly uncomfortable because access is so restricted. ''It goes against
everything I believe in, it's absolutely against the grain of equal
opportunities.'' She's chasing Lottery money in the hope that
refurbishment can soon get under way.
She also flies a persuasive flag for bringing people to the arts
through interpretation in its widest sense -- ''education'' strikes her
as outmoded, patronising, and full of cant. She'd rather have forums
where artists and audiences can engage in critical debate, can discuss
work and what it means to them as individuals -- and that's whether
they're seven or 77.
She's keen to find new ways of bringing people in and past that
daunting foyer. At the same time, she's eager to take CCA out, to
explore possibilities of programming CCA events in other spaces.
''I want people to be aware of what we are, and that we are different,
exciting, challenging. I want us to have a relevance to the whole of
Glasgow, a meaningful commitment to the demography of this area. I want
. . . '' She pauses, looks round the cafe, at the students, mothers,
tots, and lone businessmen. Her eyes twinkle.
''I don't want ONE group of people associated with CCA. I want 300
groups of people associated with CCA.''
I wish I'd hauled my taxi driver in with me. Rae could have told him
what the CCA is all about. Ultimately it's all about us and Rae is
determined that we are going to find ourselves, alive and thinking, in a
centre that reflects our times.

Brian Joseph speaks to a couple knocked out by a device to produce a
culinary staple.
IF someone hadn't coined the phrase already, Catherine and Arthur
Beattie could have given it to the world: It's the best thing since
sliced bread . . .
They're talking about their Panasonic bread maker -- a dream machine
that sounds too good to be true: bung flour, sugar, fat, milk, salt,
water and easy-blend yeast into a container, close the lid, switch on
and wait four hours. Hey presto: a loaf that would do justice to
granny's cast iron oven. As the wholesomely nostalgic aroma wafts round
their kitchen in Aberdeen, all the Beatties need is the home-spun
strains of the New World largo for Arthur to declare: ''It's bread wi'
nowt taken out -- even less effort put in.''
WRVS Grampian regional organiser Catherine is engagingly frank about
her pre-Panasonic forays into breadmaking: ''You could have soled your
boots with the results,'' she jests. Now, she reckons, her
electronically-engineered whites, wholemeals, granaries and fruit loaves
could steal a prize in the home produce section.
It was a revelation, too, for her husband, who remembers cookhouse
bread served up during his Merchant Marine days. Now he also rises to
the occasion every time after delving into the recipe book for such
exotic variations as apricot and walnut loaf, cheese and onion, herb and
garlic.
''Neither of us was sure whether it was going to be a costly mistake
when we took the plunge at Christmas, but it's proved one of our most
rewarding investments,'' says Catherine. Friends from the WRVS who come
to tea -- for rolls, brioche and croissants as well as the bread --
agree.
Because the Panasonic Bakery -- it's about the size of a breadbin --
can be programmed like an alarm clock, newly-baked bread will be waiting
when you arrive home from work, or at breakfast time. And when you come
to sell your house, as any estate agent will tell you, there's nothing
like fresh baking to seduce prospective purchasers.
The machine is not widely stocked, but John Lewis stores at Edinburgh,
Aberdeen, and Newcastle upon Tyne sell it for #199.99.

Margaret Vaughan comes up with loads of ways to spend #55m, without
going anywhere near the opera.
SAY what you like, but it's not easy trying to splurge #55m on good
causes. Where to start? What about taking on another 28,000 junior
doctors, plus the same number of nurses on the wards, and no change left
over? Or say 10,000 hip replacements, leaving enough for 23
state-of-the-art MRI scanners to help in the early detection of brain
tumours and cancers, with enough left over to build a couple of
children's hospices.
But then there's education to fret about: #55m would, after all, buy a
lot of music teachers. You get 40 to the million, so that's what, say,
20,000 across UK schools for a year; and what the heck, let's throw the
small change of #2.4m at the Centre for the Performing Arts which
Lothian can't afford to build . . .
You could always go mad and send 112,000 pensioners on an
all-inclusive two-week holiday to a three-star hotel in Majorca, and
still have #10m pocket money to play bingo with; but would they want to
go? Then there's the Fort William sleeper. That amount of money could
wipe out its #2.5m yearly loss and keep it running for the next 20
years, but there's the worry of what to do with the #10m left over . . .
Much easier, really, to chuck the lot at the Royal Opera House. After
all, if you are paying as much as #250 a ticket for one of 2096 plush
seats, amidst ornate art work, gilt panelling and statues, in such an
exclusive institution, you shouldn't be expected to have to use an
electric fan to keep cool because there's no air conditioning, now
should you?
Arts Council chairman Lord Gowrie has assured us, after all, that the
Lottery grant towards the refurbishment of the Grade One listed Covent
Garden building is vital: ''I do not like the crudity of the words rich
and poor,'' he huffs, assuring us that it's not all rich toffs who are
clamouring to pay #55 for a cheap seat to see the ballet The Midsummer
Marriage: ''Opera audiences I have seen are very often quite struggling
middle-class professional people.''
So that's all right then? Well, no, not really. Is it churlish to
believe that a regressive form of taxation, which is what the Lottery
is, should take a disproportionate amount of money from the poor -- as
the evidence shows -- and disburse it to the rich? Is it merely
philistine to point out that #55m would fund the rebuilding and
upgrading of one of the UK's leading research hospitals, the Western
General in Edinburgh, and recall that, since the country was infested by
Lottery fever, charities and voluntary organisations reckon they have
lost #212m in income to it?
Perhaps, of course, it simply depends on your definition of a good
cause.
Tricia Marwick of Shelter has one: she recalls that a former Minister,
Sir George Young, once memorably described the homeless sleeping on
London's streets as the people you stepped over on your way home from
the opera: ''There are around 1000 people sleeping rough in Scotland
every night -- #55m would pay for an initiative to find every one of
them shelter in a hostel, similar to the Government's Rough Sleepers'
Initiative. It was after all, all those bodies huddled in the doorways
of Covent Garden which sparked the original scheme.''
Quality child-care costs #100 a week: One Parent Family Scotland
points out that #55m would go a long way to helping 55,000 deprived
children get a better start in life. It would also let the parents it
helps fulfil their aim to get out of the benefit trap and into education
or find work.
But the group's not greedy. And, says Ian Maxwell, its dreams of
hitting the Lottery jackpot are more modest than wishing for a
multi-million pound windfall. In fact #25,000 would do fine. That would
buy the caravan it is frantically fundraising for. It will allow 100
families a holiday every year. Then there's the cost of the After School
Care project, offering places for 73 children from 48 families, a mere
snip at #70,000 a year.
Sue Ramsden at Age Concern Scotland wondered how many home-helps at
#4.50 an hour would go into a figure of #55m? At say 10 hours per frail
elderly person per week? Let's call it #1m a week, with #10m over to pay
for such essentials as television licences for a few thousand
pensioners.
A day-centre for rural towns and villages comes in at #500,000 for
building costs and the same for staff and care costs. Sue knows. Age
Concern has just opened one in Caithness: ''That kind of money means Age
Concern could build another 55.''
You don't have to go far to tot up the value of #55m to an
overstretched health service. Try the out-patients department of any
hospital with a waiting-list for cardiac surgery: with coronary by-pass
surgery coming in at around #5800 per op', and heart transplants
#41,500, you would dent the waiting time fairly substantially. And how
many hip replacements, at #2500, would gobble up #55m? 22,000, actually.
Then, at the other end of the age scale, are the 1,000,000 young
people aged between 16 and 24 who are not in jobs or in education. The
Commission on Social Justice reckons it would cost around #50 a week to
allow each of them to spend three months working on community projects,
such as respite care for the elderly, school clubs for youngsters. And
that still leaves you with #5m to play with . . .
Or how about 50 community swimming pools? 11,000,000 new school
textbooks? 2000 extra primary school teachers? Then again you could
always use it to buy 250,000 lottery punters a ticket to the opera at
the Royal Opera House, which is still optimistic that the remaining #28m
it wants to refurbish its fabric will come in the next tranche of
Lottery funds. It has not, of course, been included in our calculations.
We're saving it up to buy the Skye Bridge for the nation.

ON the evidence of the first half of last night's recital by
unfamiliar American pianist Tony Caramia (isn't that what Gomez use to
call Morticia?), American academics should have left ragtime well alone.
Or at least left it as it was. Some of them did, but the composers whose
work was performed by Caramia developed what they called ''Contemporary
Ragtime''. They'd say it was a homage to the original music. I'd say,
based on what Caramia played, it was more of a pastiche.
To make matters worse, Caramia's interpretations of such
over-derivative pieces as Glenn Jenks's Gymnoraggy (the composer has so
little shame he's even nicked part of Satie's title) and the Joplinesque
Brass Knuckles (by the Williams Albright and Bolcom) were schmaltzy,
laboured, and downright flashy.
There was no doubting the pianist's technical abilities, but when it
came to creating an atmosphere, he blew it almost every time. The only
exceptions being a trio of pieces by the Fats Waller-influenced Robin
Frost, whose music had enough charm to withstand the battering it
received from Caramia's heavy-handedness.
The post-interval selection of ''jazz'' fared no better. Probably
worse, in fact. Ellington's C Jam Blues was forced and
uncomfortable-sounding -- totally lacking in swing -- while Beauty and
the Beast was over-worked and over-florid. All in all, pianistic
purgatory.

WHEN you see Noel Coward performed well he fairly sizzles with comic
energy. The trick is for actors not to be seduced by his decadent, upper
middle-class world, which can all too easily send them towards a languid
inertia in which the precision of the comic language is exchanged for
the torpor of the laid-back lifestyle.
Happily it's a trap avoided in Kenny Ireland's production of Private
Lives -- the one about a divorced couple who accidentally arrange their
second honeymoons at the same time and place, whereupon they decide they
preferred each other all along. It sets off at a cracking pace that gets
maximum mileage from Coward's lightning turns of phrase which the actors
hit squarely every time.
That they deliver the gags with great timing and understanding is
certainly true, but there's also evidence of a good deal of work having
been done beyond the immediate requirements of the text. David Robb and
Briony McRoberts as the old newly-weds are masters of deadpan cool,
which offsets the manic facial contortions of the excellent Katy
Brittain and the gawky lack of physical control of Angus Wright all the
more hilariously.
Designed by Russell Craig, who is inspired by the period setting
rather than held down by it, Ireland's production is full of witty
detail (exploding pillows, off-kilter body-language, and Harley Loudon's
scene-stealing French maid), which only occasionally interrupts the
natural flow of the comedy.
The best, it has to be said, is all in the first act, when both energy
levels and Coward's writing are at their peak, but despite some slower
moments there are big laughs throughout.

The man who is doing the unthinkable: Julia Langdon reviews the
irresistible rise of Tony Blair who has shown no hesitation in shocking
the trades unions.
IN the spring of this year, Bill Morris, the leader of the Transport
and General Workers' Union, sought a private meeting with Tony Blair,
the leader of the Labour Party, to talk about relations between the
union movement and the party. He was surprised, shocked and even rather
hurt to find, however, that Blair was, quite simply, uninterested in
what he had to say.
The unspoken message from Tony Blair was: ''Get lost.'' What he
actually said was: ''If Labour loses the next election it will be your
fault -- yours, and John Edmonds' and Rodney Bickerstaffe's.'' It was
still not clear to Morris then, nor to Edmonds, the general secretary of
the giant GMB union, nor to Bickerstaffe of Unison, that Tony Blair's
''new'' Labour Party had not and would not have the time for bothering
much what the unions -- the old unions, the silly old unions? -- thought
about anything.
Edmonds was muttering darkly at this time about a ''hidden agenda.''
He wrote that he would be prepared to discuss the issue of ending the
link between the unions and the party with any politician, yet
complained: ''But you don't find anybody who's saying it. So it's a bit
difficult to engage with this talk if it's going on.''
Earlier this month Tony Blair spoke to the TGWU conference and told
it, bluntly, that the union's influence over the party he leads was now
limited and would become more so. So now they all know.
This shift in relations tells us more than anything about what has
happened in the Labour Party in the last year. It is to many people,
unthinkable, unimaginable, that a Labour leader should tell the union
movement which gave birth to it nearly a century ago that he has little
further interest in maintaining this historic relationship. But then
that essentially is what Tony Blair has done over the year since his
election: he has made the political world address the unimaginable,
think the unthinkable.
It would be wrong to describe the vast array of change that Blair has
wrought as revisionism. Certainly he has been charged with this in party
circles, if only whispered behind hands privately. Revisionism is one of
the dirty words in the old Labour lexicon, but not only has Tony Blair
thrown away that book, he has re-invented the Labour Party. As he said
last weekend: ''By the next election over half our members will have
joined since the last election. It is literally a new party.'' And where
else to say this, where better, but in the lion's den?
Those words were part of his controversial speech in Australia to
Rupert Murdoch's media executives, the speech in which he dared to stake
a claim to inherit the radical tradition instituted by Margaret
Thatcher. A few months ago it made the newspapers that Murdoch and Blair
had even met; now here was the Labour leader travelling to the other
side of the world to star as the key speaker at a News International
conference, to be introduced by Murdoch as one of the ''most outstanding
political leaders in the world today''.
The world has perceptibly shifted on its axis. The degree of change
within a year is extraordinary. Can it really only be 12 months since
Tony Blair took on the Labour Party, still grieving after the untimely
death of John Smith, its lost leader, and also taking on, to everyone's
surprise, all the party's vested interests? And now, here he is, as if
that was not enough, taking on the Establishment. These are the actions
of a bold man with a bold agenda. The odd thing is how little criticism
he has yet met from any quarter: the Labour Party, the Tories or, even,
the Establishment.
The Establishment in fact seems to like Blair and what he says more
almost than anyone else. He has been endorsed by the anti-Major right
among the chattering classes. They like his honesty -- for example his
decision to send his own child to a grant-maintained school -- and his
daring -- again for example his preparedness to adapt Labour's education
policy to the realities facing ''people like him'' and revoke the
party's previous commitment to restore all grant-maintained schools to
local authority control.
They recognise the truth of his acknowledgment that Margaret Thatcher
introduced to British politics in the 1980s a radicalism that was not
necessarily Tory. She was brave and fearless. Blair wishes to be seen as
the same. Yes, he says, unashamedly, he admires her determination and
her sense of purpose. And she, too, has had her twopennyworth by
extolling his courage -- in unspoken contrast to the pussyfooting
passivity of her successor.
The mainstream of the Conservative Party is worried, as it should be,
by the success of Tony Blair's appeal to Middle England. In one of the
innumerable relaunches of itself that John Major's Government has
attempted in the course of a troubled last five years, there was earlier
this year a specific appeal to ''Middle England''. (It should really
have been ''Middle Britain'', but whatever the Tories say, they have
rather given up on improving their electoral chances in Scotland.) It
was an endorsement of Tony Blair's success.
And that, of course, is something that is troubling to the Labour
Party, the old or ancient Labour Party, whose members are not just
uneasy, but uncomfortable with what has happened in the last 12 months.
The common charge is that Blair has stolen the Conservative Party's
clothes, that he has moved Labour so far to the Right that Labour is now
indistinguishable from John Major's meritocratic ''classless'' Tory
Party, designed famously to represent ''a nation at ease with itself''.
Tony Blair himself answers this cogently, as he did yesterday in
interviews to mark the anniversary of his election, by defining the
difference between his own agenda ''staking out the radical centre
ground'', in his terminology, and that of the Tories, caught up as they
are with paying for the social consequences of their own economic
failure in the course of the last 16 years. But that is not altogether
enough.
The reality is that by myriad means, in a hundred different ways,
Blair has not just changed the Labour Party, superficially beyond
recognition, he has indeed re-invented it. Something had to be done. The
years of failure had taken their toll on party morale as well as much
else. It is worth noting, too, that Neil Kinnock is said to be
considerably resentful about the claims of ''new'' Labour. The failed,
unsuccessful, former leader is said to feel that he deserves more
recognition than he has been awarded as the agent of change in the
party, and is said to mind being cast in the list of the failures of
recent Labour history.
He used to say, when first elected to the Labour leadership in 1983,
that if Labour lost the next election it would not be his fault. It did
and it wasn't. It was partly his bad luck that his name became
associated with failure, and although he could not see it at the time,
his was to be a period of transition.
But the Labour Party that is now emerging is unrecognisable to many,
including its own members. It is hard for some to accept that a new
policy committee should be established without a single MP among its
members, but with others who have returned to the Labour Party after
flirting with the Social Democrats -- and, in some cases, standing for
parliamentary seats, splitting the vote and denying Labour candidates a
victory.
But Labour is cowed from its years in Opposition, from the memory of
its factional in-fighting, from the legacy of losing. Its members are
prepared to try anything. That is why the party meekly accepted the
change in Clause 4 of its constitution earlier this year.
This was probably the most symbolic democratic change so far
introduced. It was not in itself far-reaching. Any member of the Labour
Party would confirm that they were not expecting the next Labour
Government to secure by hand or by brain the full fruits of anybody's
industry in the next five minutes. The fact that Tony Blair decided he
wanted to abolish this commitment, as a signal, was accepted and, albeit
somewhat resentfully, understood.
The vote, though, was meaningful at one level -- for Tony Blair's
audience -- and meaningless at another. Party members voted for change
but there was still a degree of resentment there that they had been
asked to make a change which they and the leadership regarded as
symbolic, but for different reasons.
The uniting factor is the need to win the next General Election. Those
who still hold up their hands for Labour give the forgotten sweet taste
of victory priority over everything, even over principle. They want that
more than they want anything else. Until then, until that victory which
Tony Blair, whatever you may think of him, seems likely to pull in, the
''old'' Labour membership will remain sullenly submissive, the old
unions will do their best to come to terms with their new roles, and the
MPs will just have to continue doing what they are told to and no
argument.
It is an awesome achievement to have knocked that lot into behaving.It
is after the Labour Party has won the next General Election that the air
will be thick with the beating wings of chickens coming home to roost.

It's a
sign of
a sick
society
when the
viewer
is turned
into an
armchair
voyeur
Tasteless television is a magnet for exhibitionists and weirdos,
believes Jimmy Reid
Saturday night is the loneliest night of the week, for that's the
night that my baby and I used to dance cheek to cheek
THE words though English are really American. World-weary,
street-wise, hard-bitten, soft-hearted, shades of Sam Spade and Philip
Marlowe, renowned private eyes of Hammett and Chandler. Their fictional
characters came to celluloid life in Bogart, Greenstreet, Lorre, and a
gaggle of sultry blondes.
Punters started talking tough-guy Hollywoodese with a Glasgow accent,
''Giez a five spot'' (fiver or Sam Molver). ''Button yer lip or Ah'll
blooter ye.'' They dreamed of ''gettin' ma hauns on a few grand''. All
from the side of the mouth. There were a million teenage Sam Spades in
Govan feigning worldly weariness, which ain't easy.
To such lyrics as ''Saturday night is the loneliest . . .'' and softly
swinging melodies, the young men and women, of times not so yore, danced
the night away in halls that were designed to look like the night clubs
in Hollywood movies. The dimmed lights were kind. Young ladies looked
like Doris Day and Ava Gardner, particularly to those young men
fortified with a few pints.
The crowded floor didn't leave much space for the Come Dancing stuff.
A smoochy shuffle was more practical and had another advantage. It
created an intimacy for ''chatting up the birds'' as it was called in
the days before political correctness clobbered our vernaculars. It was
kind of like a trade union branch meeting. You got up, stated your case,
if your motion was approved, you had a lumber.
The dance halls closed before midnight, disgorging the starry-eyed on
to the pavements. If the girl lived in the back of beyond, in housing
schemes like Blackhill or Bearsden, then couples sought a nearby dark
corner where they could winch, but these were in great demand and often
already occupied by cheats who had left before the last waltz. Could
they have been Germans rehearsing their takeover of Mediterranean sun
beds in years to come?
Then to the rescue came the planning wonders of Victorian Glasgow
where magnificent office blocks were crisscrossed by a network of lanes
wherein couples canoodled to their hearts' content, though young women
were usually content with less than the young men, leading to plaintive
cries of ''you don't really love me or . . .''
That apart, a locus in the lane was a bit of all right except for
dratted disturbers of passionate embraces and disrupters of towering,
but seldom realised, expectations. These were DOMs, dirty old men,
lurking in dark places in hope of seeing a couple in flagrante delicto.
But where have all the DOMs gone? Have they seen the light and hung up
their dirty raincoats? Yes, but the light they saw was the glow of a
television set. Why go on lonely vigils and risk getting your nose
punched when you can sit at home, sip cocoa, and watch flagrante delicto
on television. Peeping Toms are now ratings fodder. Their ''custom''
sought by television moguls. They've been renamed voyeurs.
Now don't get me wrong. Let the poor sods have their kicks. Sex, one
of life's more pleasant dramas, is for them a passive spectator
activity. And they aren't even viewing the real thing but a crude
pastiche. More a review of biological plumbing than romantic copulation.
Much more disturbing is that television in general has become
increasingly voyeuristic, and therefore a magnet for exhibitionists and
weirdos. Some time ago there was a series on the telly under the generic
title The Red Light Zone   or something like that. I started to watch
one movie and found it unwatchable, and not for naughtiness. It was
boring, which, I suspect is true of all porn.
I later switched back to the same channel for a studio discussion on
sexuality. About a dozen people sprawling about telling how they did
things unto others and what they wanted others to do unto them. With the
exception of a prostitute, who looked rather nice, the rest looked as if
they had lived for the past 10 years in subterranean vaults and had
complexions like yellowing whitewash. I started worrying lest they
couldn't get back to whence they came before sunrise.
One young man was introduced as straight, which in terms of the
perpendicular seemed unlikely, as he enthused about his sexual
proclivities. He reminded me of a fellow apprentice who used to regale
us during the morning tea break with stories of his gorged sexual
appetite.
We expected him to go blind (according to the folklore of the times
there was a direct connection between teenage sex and the optic nerves),
but he never did, which to our minds was conclusive proof that he wasn't
doing what he claimed, or not as frequently. In other words he was
bumming his load. So was this lad on television. He was bumming,
posturing as a womaniser. It was rather sad.
Then there was a married couple. The wife did the talking, which is
like saying  Niagara Falls flows gently on its way. They appeared to
have no interests other than sex. It wasn't clear whether they worked,
maybe they couldn't spare the time. He occasionally grunted agreement
when asked by his spouse to do so. His sunken eyes looked fearfully at
the world as if afraid of her suggesting another variation. While she
boasted of his hanky panky athleticism he slouched further down the
sofa, like a clapped-out chronically undernourished Woody Allen.
There were gays and lesbians, camp and butch, who tried their best to
validate that awful stereotyping of homosexuals which panders to the
worst prejudices of the homophobic. It was an awful programme. The
participants had been dredged from God knows where. How many watch these
programmes? Half a million, one million, more? That's the worry.
Television voyeurism is creeping in everywhere, and it's sick.
Peak-time Blind Date is the sort of programme which gives
straightforward pornography a good name. The hostess Cilla Black in an
earlier incarnation was a skinny pop singer with two backs and two
voices. One voice was little girlish, the other a clap of thunder which
sent canaries hurtling to the bottom of cages, frightened the life out
of Rottweilers, and brought relief to the constipated.
Now she has stopped singing and has shoulders like Frank Tyson, on top
of which sits a head. Her programme is nudge nudge, wink wink, smut, and
worse than anything you would see in The Red Light Zone.
Cilla stands with a young man, giving matronly chuckles as he flexes
his libido. Behind a partition sitting on high bar stools are three very
attractive young women. The young man has to ask the young women the
same three questions. The questions are full of single entendres and so
are the answers.
He has to decide on the basis of their answers which he will take on
an all-expenses-paid holiday. The answers pledge that they can light his
fire and give him a real good time, and the studio is knee deep in
euphemisms for the sexual act. The sort of things sailors are supposed
to hear when they come through harbour gates.
Then there is a reversal of roles with young men doing the answering.
They boast of sexual prowess with promises of what they can do for her.
The language is even less coded. It sounds like a knocking shop without
the cash. Sex is degradingly implicit.
Yet those who get anger spasms when Billy Connolly uses an Anglo-Saxon
four-letter word beloved by Chaucer, are totally uncomplaining when
confronted with this crap. Sexual voyeurism at its mealy-mouthed worst
has become mass entertainment on British television.
Television voyeurism goes well beyond sex. The Oprah Winfrey Show
started off talking about issues, and she was an ideal presenter. The
compelling need for more and more shows and higher or sustainable
ratings has turned it into a voyeurs' paradise. People's souls are
bared, their tragedies, heartbreaks, humiliations, put on parade in an
atmosphere of recrimination, or suffocating emotions, including hatred.
People in the audience vent their opposition or support. It's a circus
and at the centre people with real problems. What harm it does them,
we'll never know.
We have had programmes about the treatment of mentally sick people,
intruding into therapy sessions. Camera crews have followed the
day-to-day life of a family and made public horrendous aspects of
certain members of that family. Cameras followed Graham Taylor, the
English manager, to the World Cup and we had ringside seats when the man
nearly had a nervous breakdown. I'm surely not the only one who finds
this kind of television repulsive.
Then there is the Jeremy Beadle type show. You may have noticed that
he doesn't stitch up the Queen Mother or the wife of the Archbishop of
Canterbury or a stockbroker from Hampstead. Oh no, it's often some old
working-class         woman.
They dump tons of manure in her front garden, knock down her garage,
or something just as diabolical. The old woman remonstrates, loses her
temper, swears, gets into a state of near hysteria, what a giggle, if
she had a heart attack it would bring the house down. Then Jeremy
appears and the victim holds her head in embarrassment and relief. I'll
send a bottle of malt whisky to the first victim that batters the swine
with a baseball bat.
Then there is the fly-on-the-wall documentaries which promise
television insights into the lives of ordinary people who will be as
open and frank as if the only extraneous creature in their home was a
fly on the wall. Some fly. They're surrounded by a crew. Cables all over
the place. Most intimidating of all, the baleful eye of the camera lens
whose brooding presence has changed the equation.
Camera starts to run. The director asks everyone to be quiet.
''Action.''  All dead natural, as natural as a bird with three wings. To
a lesser or greater degree people tend to over respond or under respond,
dry up or bluster. The most you can do is to minimise the camera's
presence, which isn't technical but a matter of human contact. That
takes time and costs money. In our deregulated television, however, the
name of the game is cost cutting and maximising profits.
Studio-based programmes are relatively dirt cheap. Studio audiences
cost nothing and seem happy to be manipulated by floor managers. They
laugh and cheer to instructions. The quiz shows worst of all. Lights
flashing. People jumping up and down in a pervasively moronic
atmosphere.
You can do half-a-dozen for the cost of one hour of drama. The days of
Brideshead and Jewel In The Crown are gone. The ITV companies want to
cut back on ITN News presumably to make room for more quiz shows. No
more Hancocks or Till Death Us Do Part. We'll get more Blind Dates. The
lowest common denominator whose tastes television wants to serve is
probably a DOM/Peeping Tom! Sorry, voyeur.
Are we becoming a nation of voyeurs? I simply remind you that putting
on public display mentally crippled exhibitionists for the titillation
of the supposed mentally healthy, has, down through the ages, been a
sign of a sick society.

Robert Hardy may appear quintessentially English, says Aileen Little,
but an ambitious new role has brought him north. As tenant of Penicuik's
seventeenth-century Newhall House, the actor aims to recreate its former
glory.
AT first sight, Robert Hardy seems the archetypal Englishman. There's
the rather plummy voice, doubtless inherited from his father, a major,
and later honed at Rugby. There are the gentlemanly pursuits -- hunting,
fishing, horsemanship. Let us not forget the Churchillian connections
(he starred in The Wilderness Years in 1981). All in all -- and despite
the Black Watch tartan shirt he is sporting when we meet -- the actor's
image is that of a man as English as Jane Austen, one of whose novels he
has recently finished filming.
An Englishman's home, they say, is his castle. So perhaps it is no
surprise that the actor -- in his 70th year -- has just moved into a
magnificent, castellated mansion. But here the illusion ends. Hardy's
new, permanent home is north of the Border. He claims Scottish
connections. And the fact he plans to open his house to the public, and
highlight its unique literary associations, reveals there is more to
Timothy Sidney Robert Hardy CBE than meets the eye.
''People elect to think of you as x, y or z because it seems
convenient,'' concedes the star of TV's All Creatures Great and Small.
''I've got some Welsh blood and some Scottish -- if I could find it
among the packing cases, I'd bring out a great sheet of parchment to
prove it. After all, when the Scots invaded England, few English girls
can have got away chaste.'' His proudest link is with former
brother-in-law and one-time Secretary of State Michael Noble.
There is no doubt Hardy has sacrificed a lot for his new, 30-roomed
home, seventeenth-century Newhall House near Penicuik. His long love
affair with the building justifies, he believes, the sale of his house
of 30 years in Henley. It justifies the fact that the #800,000 proceeds
of the sale are to be ploughed straight into restoration. It even
justifies the fact that ownership of Newhall is not strictly his at all.
As a child, he sometimes accompanied his aunts when they journeyed to
stay with two old school chums, the Maclagan sisters -- twins and
chatelaines of Newhall. One sister died eight years ago; the other, one
assumes to be too elderly to manage the 160-acre property. But the
surviving Miss Maclagan has established a trust -- and Hardy has taken
it over for a peppercorn rent. ''Over the past few years, the move
became a point of discussion. Some of my family think I'm mad. The house
(which is in need of substantial redecoration) demands one's
concentration and input. But I do believe it's worth doing because of my
affection for the place -- a piece of conservation and perpetuation. I
aim to give it my best shot.''
Hardy's enthusiasm is tempered by sadness, however: the surviving Miss
Maclagan has found leaving the house ''a terrible wrench. I've hated
that part. But a cottage is being done up for her in the grounds.''
There is apprehension, too, about a condition of the tenancy. To
preserve its charitable status, the trust proposes to resume the
practice of opening the grounds to the public, along with certain rooms
in the house. ''I feel split about it,'' he admits frankly. ''It's a
price to pay, but I feel honour bound to implement it.''
As an English graduate (Magdalen College, Oxford, student of C S
Lewis), Hardy will take pleasure in sharing Newhall's literary heritage.
It was here the eighteenth-century Scots poet Allan Ramsay was given the
plot and scenery for his pastoral comedy The Gentle Shepherd. The owner
at the time (Newhall's history goes back to the Crichtouns and to a
monastery before that), poet and physician Dr Alexander Pennicuik, was a
friend.
One of Newhall's splendid sundials is a monument to Ramsay, each panel
on its square, tapering shaft referring to the play. The library ceiling
(complete with painting of eighteenth-century Scottish literati) carries
plaster motifs of a shepherd's crook and panpipes -- a rural image
repeated also on exterior stonework.
Reinforcing the pastoral idyll, subsequent owners landscaped the
grounds to match the play -- a case of life imitating art after art has
imitated life. Hardy is a Ramsay fan: after all, the inn at Carlops
which bears the writer's name is his local. ''The Gentle Shepherd hit a
particular nerve with its vernacular and rural felicity. Its tremendous
success at the time meant people learned a lot about the area and I hope
they can again.''
Notwithstanding love of the written word (Hardy's youngest daughter,
Justine, published a travel book this year), one suspects this
grandfather of three is really a historian manque. Newhall suits him. He
is a much respected consultant to the Mary Rose Trust, and is a member
of the board of trustees of the Royal Armouries.
HE is also a world expert on the longbow. ''I've got 30 bows and
eventually I'll have a bow room here,'' he says. Bowyery has long been a
fascination and he has often shot competitively against Scotland's Royal
Company of Archers. Our traditions in this field, he explains, are
honourable. ''Flowers of the Forest is about the bowmen of Ettrick
Forest. And the Scots Guards were originally bowmen/bodyguards to the
French king. It has always puzzled me why Scots bowmen didn't do better
in the wars -- I put it down to clan organisation.''
Hardy is a man in a hurry. He is writing a history of military
archery. Always in demand for work, he has just finished filming
Gulliver's Travels; new offers are ''being discussed'' (he yearns to
play Falstaff in a Branagh production). And now he has a property to
restore. In the absence of a wife (both marriages ''to splendid women
and excellent mothers'' are dissolved), will the refurbishment of
Newhall lack a woman's touch? ''I shall take lots of advice,'' the new
squire responds cautiously, ''and some of it will be female.''
Come October, Hardy will also fit in a 70th birthday celebration.
Astonishingly unlined and fit for his years, he plans to host the
occasion at Newhall -- filming permitting. He abominates the whole
business of ''luvvie-dom'' in his profession (''Some of it is media envy
looking in from the outside''); his unpretentious, practical qualities
should go down very well with Scots.
Newhall's Ramsay sundial bears some lines, attributed to Burns, which
seem very apt for a man approaching three score years and ten. The Bard
wrote:
Observe how fast, Time hurries past,
Then use each hour, while in your power,
For comes the sun, but time flies on.
Proceeding ever, returning never.
Hardy concurs with the sentiments. ''I've always believed that,'' he
nods, his peacocks mewing on the lawns outside his drawing room. ''My
motto is to live every day as if it's my last. But I'm not ready to
depart yet.''

Elizabeth Westcott finds the Dorothy Perkins' image transformed
through an advertising campaign fronted by supermodel Helena
Christiansen.
THE competition between British high street clothes retailers is
fierce. With little to choose between their affordable interpretations
of the latest looks, it comes down to a question of marketing. As one
retailer recently discovered, the female clothes-buying public is
responding to an extra injection of glamour.
Last year Dorothy Perkins transformed itself from another ordinary
high street store by using a far-from-ordinary model to promote its
clothes: supermodel Helena Christiansen.
As part of a general overhaul of the shop's image, including a new
range of contemporary clothing and major shop refits, Christiansen was
imported as the new face of Dorothy Perkins. And what a face; glossy
brown skin stretched over the flawless bulbs of her cheekbones, the
voluptuous mouth, enigmatic green eyes . . . but of course it's not
simply how good she looks. It's who she is.
Managing director of Dorothy Perkins, Stephen Sunnucks, says that this
marketing masterstroke was the result of comprehensive customer
research.
''We wanted to show off our product to the very best effect,'' he
said. ''Our research showed that our customers wanted a model who was
friendly and approachable, and Christiansen fitted in with a lot of
that.
''Also, she's at the top of her profession as is Dorothy Perkins.''
While pre- and post-Christiansen sales figures are not available,
there is no doubt that the advertising campaign has been hugely
successful. Only recently, Dorothy Perkins completed negotiations for a
third season, autumn 1995, with the model.
''I am delighted at the way she's been received by our customers,''
says Sunnucks. ''I don't think our image has really changed, but
Christiansen seems to have captured people's imagination.
''I think what attracts them is the way she is portrayed, simple and
uncluttered, which can be very impactful.''
Sunnucks is reticent to attribute Dorothy Perkins' success entirely to
Christiansen. Updated in-store environments (complete with prize-winning
changing-rooms), and the quality of the product itself are also
important. Whether Christiansen's supermodel status or the whole culture
of the supermodel has anything to do with it is not, he says, for him to
comment on.
However, the word from the street is that the supermodel has
everything to do with it. According to Dorothy Perkins shopper Carol
Muir, Christiansen has made the clothes more fashionable: ''I would say
that if Dorothy Perkins is more popular, it's because Helena
Christiansen is a supermodel. And supermodels are the height of
fashion.''
Student Alison Daly, who regularly shops at Dorothy Perkins, is more
expansive: ''The thing about Helena Christiansen is how high-profile she
is -- you see her everywhere. Especially the women's magazines. She's on
the cover, then inside you see photos of her on the catwalk wearing all
the designer clothes. Or else she's in adverts for really expensive
stuff like Istante or Sonia Rykiel.
''To be honest, I started noticing Dorothy Perkins more once I'd seen
all the posters of her wearing their clothes. I think because she's so
high-fashion she sort of elevates the clothes.''
Australian Julie Inglis says that since Dorothy Perkins started using
Christiansen as a model the whole image of the store has changed.
''I remember when I first came here two years ago it was really daggy,
old-fashioned. I remember going in there and walking straight out
again,'' she said. ''I think she influences you -- if she's wearing it
then it's cool enough to wear. The whole thing about supermodels is a
bit of a joke but you can't help but be interested, it's like gossip. We
know their names and who their boyfriends are.''
All three women agree that while Christiansen caught their eye, the
fact that the clothes themselves are stylish is what makes them go back
to the store. Dorothy Perkins caters for a broad cross-section of the
market; women aged 20-44, from single working-women to pregnant
mothers-to-be. As Stephen Sunnucks points out, there's no point in
spending money to promote a product which isn't worth the attention.
And it is spending the money, although Dorothy Perkins remains
close-lipped as to the exact amount. However, Sunnucks believes
Christiansen is worth every penny of her huge fee:
''Definitely -- in life if you want the best that's what you go for,
and Christiansen's definitely the best.''

THREE more convicted terrorists were transferred to jails in Northern
Ireland today, the Prison Service announced.
The decision to move Sean Cruickshank, Gerard Mackin, and Eamonn
O'Donnell was made as a ''dirty'' protest by Irish terrorists demanding
transfers from English jails spread.
The three moved today were not involved in the protests.
O'Donnell and Cruickshank, both members of the Irish National
Liberation Army, were jailed for 20 years in 1993 for a fire bombing
campaign in Leeds. They were serving their sentences at Full Sutton jail
near York.
Mackin was jailed for 25 years in October last year for his part in an
IRA bombing campaign in London in 1993.
The transfers bring to 18 the number of terrorists moved to Northern
Ireland from English jails since the IRA ceasefire.
Sinn Fein has been campaigning to win the transfer of all Republican
terrorists in jails in England.
However, the party was critical of the way today's transfers were
handled.
The party's prison spokesman Pat McGeown said: ''The prisoners moved
today were informed 12 weeks ago that they were to be transferred
immediately.
''The delay in implementing this move was both unnecessary and
provocative.''

<RECORDNO>977289443</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR doctor, who was sacked after the conviction of killer nurse
Beverley Allitt, has won an appeal against his dismissal, it was
announced yesterday.
Dr Frederick Porter, one of two consultant paediatricians who claimed
they were made scapegoats in the aftermath of the affair, should be
reinstated, Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell has ruled.
However, Mr Dorrell disallowed a similar appeal by Dr Charith
Nanayakkara, who also was dismissed on technical grounds.
The two doctors were in charge of the special care baby unit at
Grantham Hospital, Lincolnshire, where Allitt murdered four children and
attempted to harm others in her care.
Both doctors were made redundant by Trent Regional Health Authority
two years ago after the unit was closed.
However, Allitt's crimes while under their charge were not given by
the authority as the official reason for making them redundant.
It is unlikely Dr Porter, who has been on full pay since lodging his
appeal to the Department of Health, will get his original job back
because of internal reorganisation.
A spokeswoman said the British Medical Association was seeking legal
advice as to whether it could take any further action on behalf of Dr
Nanayakkara.
His appeal was disallowed on the grounds he had already terminated his
contract with the Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, which ran the ward
at Grantham.

More than #280m will be invested in attracting tourists to Edinburgh
over the next five years in a plan which will include hotel
developments, enhancement of the Old Town, and improvements to the city
for the benefit of tourists.
The initiative, announced yesterday, has local authority, Scottish
Tourist Board, and Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise backing.
Mr Roger Carter, Edinburgh Tourist Board's chief executive, said #50m
a year could be injected into the economy by the year 2000, adding: ''We

THE man who will take over from the sacked chairman of Scottish
Nuclear said yesterday the removal of Mr James Hann was a
straightforward business decision.
Mr Robin Jeffrey, 56, was speaking in the wake of the political furore
which greeted the dismissal of Mr Hann, 62. Both Labour and the SNP
claimed the Government had settled a score with Mr Hann, who
unsuccessfully campaigned for the company to remain independent after
privatisation.
Mr Hann was asked to quit as the Government appointed executives to a
holding company which will lead Scottish Nuclear and its English
counterpart, Nuclear Electric, into privatisation as a joint concern
next year.
However, Mr Jeffrey, the chief executive of Scottish Nuclear, who will
take over as chairman of the company when Mr Hann steps down on October
1, said Mr Hann's removal was not a political issue.
He threw his weight behind Mr John Robb, the chairman designate of the
new holding company, who said on Wednesday that he had sought Mr Hann's
removal to bring more technical expertise and younger blood on to the
board.
Mr Jeffrey said: ''Mr Robb is looking to the longer term beyond
privatisation. He wanted a balance of skills and ages.''
The decision that he should replace Mr Hann, whom he described as a
chairman of vision, had come as a total surprise, Mr Jeffrey said.
Everyone at Scottish Nuclear had been deeply sorry to see Mr Hann go.
''It came as an enormous surprise to all of us.''
Mr Jeffrey denied there had been any erosion of commitment to
Scotland. The holding company, he said, would be based in Scotland,
while there would be an increase in the number of jobs.
Between 50 and 100 skilled engineering jobs would be transferred to
Peel Park in East Kilbride, while more new jobs would flow from the
holding company .
He said: ''It will be good for Scotland, good for nuclear, and good
for Scottish Nuclear.''
The new headquarters will be based in Edinburgh, although Mr Jeffrey
said no buildings had been bought as yet. ''We have looked at a number
of sites and hope to make an announcement reasonably soon. We are in the
middle of commercial negotiations and good progress has been made.''
Mr Jeffrey also sought to allay fears that the HQ in Edinburgh would
be little more than a brass plate with all the decisions taken down
south. ''The company will be run from Scotland,'' he said.
He also said he anticipated that senior staff would be based in
Scotland.
Meanwhile, Mr Hann said last night that he would be seeking a new job
after October. He said: ''The first I knew of my removal was at a
meeting with Mr Robb on Tuesday. I had no indication before the meeting
that there was any desire that I should leave the company. I was very
disappointed it happened.
''As from October, I will be looking for another job. I feel extremely
fit and have plenty to offer to the business sector and I hope that
another opportunity will come my way.''
* The World Association of Nuclear Operators -- comprising nuclear
utilities around the globe, which was set up six years ago to monitor
safety -- is due to visit Scottish Nuclear's power station at Torness
today.
WANO unites 130 operators of nuclear power plants throughout the world
and Remy Carle, who heads France's nuclear electricity utility, EDF, and
is chairman of the association's governing board, said: ''Our mission is
to maximise the safety and reliability of the operation of nuclear power
plants by exchanging information and encouraging communication,
comparison and peer emulation among our members.''
The WANO governing board members who will tour Torness include
chairmen and chief executives from nuclear power stations in China,
Japan, eastern Europe, and the US.
Mr Jeffrey said: ''Scottish Nuclear is delighted to welcome such a
knowledgeable group of business leaders from the nuclear industry, which
is truly international in scale.

THE Royal College of Midwives pulled back from an internal rift
yesterday when a motion of no confidence in its ruling council was
withdrawn at the last minute.
The motion was put down for debate at the college's annual conference
by members angered by the council's decision to break with other health
unions and accept a Government pay deal of a 1% national rise with local
deals on another 2% and gradings.
A second critical motion expressing resentment at the council decision
to accept the concept of local pay bargaining without prior consultation
with the membership, and demanding that the council account for its
actions, was defeated by 148 to 65, with 40 abstentions, after an often
heated debate.
Delegates also voted at the conference in Belfast against an amendment
that the 30,000 membership be balloted on the pay deal.
Council chairman Phyllis Watters said afterwards: ''We are please the
no-confidence motion was dropped but it does not mean we are not aware
there are concerns out there among members.''

ISRAEL said today that it would free up to 1000 imprisoned
Palestinians at the signing of an accord with the PLO on expanding
Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank, due next week.
The announcement followed statements by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
that the Jewish state and the PLO had reached ''very important
understandings'' towards an accord.
A PLO official said Peres was due to join Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators at a secluded Israeli hotel where they were meeting for the
fifth day to hammer out a deal by next Tuesday's signing deadline.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor told reporters earlier:
''There will be a massive release around the signing date.''
He said that between 600 and 1000 prisoners of the nearly 5500 Israel
still holds will be released. About 4000 were released when Gaza-Jericho
self-rule began in May last year.
The fate of Palestinian prisoners, who had gone on a hunger strike for
freedom, has been a sticking point in the talks on Palestinian elections
and Israeli army withdrawal from West Bank Arab population centres, the
second stage of a 1993 peace deal.
Peacemakers were grappling today with 19 points in dispute, PLO
officials said. The sides hope to initial an accord next week in Cairo
and sign it in Washington, they said.
Palestinian and Israeli officials said chief among the subjects in
contention was sharing scarce water resources.
Peres, who yesterday met PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat in Egypt, told
Israel Radio today: ''Very important understandings were reached. They
must now be formulated in writing and with caution.''
He cited progress on water sharing and an Israeli army pull-out from
West Bank Arab population centres.
Water is one of the toughest issues to be resolved. Experts say some
37% of the West Bank Palestinian population do not have running water.
They say Palestinians receive about one-fifth of West Bank water
resources while Israel takes the rest.
Senior Palestine Liberation Organisation negotiator Nabil Shaath said
that he doubted whether the sides could meet the July 25 target and that
talks might last for weeks longer.
However Major General Nasser Yousef, whose officials today toured the
West Bank town of Jenin whic is next in line for autonomy, predicted

''These moments are historic,'' he told a crowd in one village. ''In
the very near future we will celebrate the deployment of our national
troops in these towns and villages.''
Yousef, who last week toured the West Bank town of Qalqilya, plans to
deploy some 5000 Palestinian troops currently based throughout the Arab
world in the West Bank, in addition to about 3000 trained in Jericho and
Gaza.
In Jerusalem tonight, about 50 Jewish settler women took over a
hilltop near the al-Khader Palestinian village in protest against plans
to expand Palestinian self-rule.
''We have tents and a fire and are preparing to stay. We are setting

EXCLUSIVE
ALL SCOTTISH Government Ministers have been ordered by Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth to curtail their holidays and prepare for a
''summer offensive'' against Labour and the Nationalists.
The initiative is designed to wrongfoot their opponents during the
long parliamentary recess and set the agenda in Scotland during what is
known as the ''silly season'' in the media, when usually there are few
serious domestic stories to report.
The Ministers -- Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, George Kynoch, Raymond
Robertson and Lord Lindsay -- will be expected to carry out high-profile
visits to all corners of Scotland and ram home the Government's message.
There are expected to be a series of new policies unveiled to seize
newspaper headlines and ensure coverage on television and radio.
The policy initiatives currently are being formulated by Mr Forsyth,
who is keen to ensure additional exposure for his team, especially his
new Ministers, Mr Robertson and Lord Lindsay.
Lord James said: ''There is certainly a lot happening, it is going to
be a busy period.''
This latest move is designed to take the fight to his opponents, which
promises to be a feature of Mr Forsyth's term of office.
Unlike Ian Lang, now President of the Board of Trade, the new Scottish
Secretary intends to be pro-active. Many in the party believe that,
while Mr Lang was a safe pair of hands, his relaxed, laid-back manner
allowed Labour and the Nationalists to dictate issues, blunting the
thrust of Government policy.
''Our opponents will always bleat no matter what we do,'' said a
senior Scottish Conservative last night. ''What we have to do do is
demonstrate that is what it is -- bleating. It is not constructive nor
is it genuine.
''They have been allowed to paint a bleak picture of what is happening
in Scotland when the opposite is the case. Particularly on the economy.
I hope George Robertson (the Shadow Scottish Secretary) is not expecting
to tan himself on some foreign beach. If so, he should make sure he has
a plane ticket at the ready to get him home fast.''
The entire party in Scotland has rallied behind Mr Forsyth. The
warring factions which so disfigured his period as party chairman have
disappeared. He even held out an olive branch to the left-leaning Tory
reform group, and it was grasped.
He is being applauded for his realistic approach to the West Highland
sleeper issue and his mocking of the ''tartan tax'' to be imposed on the
Scots, a reference to Tony Blair's proposed tax-raising assembly in
Edinburgh.
However, it is his ''lateral thinking'' which they find particularly
impressive -- such as the appointment of Dick Douglas, a former Labour
MP and now member of the SNP's executive as chairman of the new watchdog
body, the Water and Sewerage Customers Council, and now his proposal to
''ambush'' the Opposition this summer.
''Michael is giving an edge to Conservative policies in Scotland and
questioning Labour's where there is a policy to question,'' the Tory
source said.
''There is a genuine feeling within the party that our current
standing in the opinion polls, 11%, is false. The presentation in the
past has not been all it should have been and it is important that we
get out there and argue for what we believe in. This will be the gist of
the summer campaign.''

CHARGES of attempting to pervert the course of justice after a road
accident were yesterday found not proven against a health board manager
and his wife.
Mr Derek Banks, 47, the Dumfries and Galloway board's general manager,
and his wife, Moira, 42, had denied pretending to police that Mrs Banks
had been driving the car involved in a crash on the Dalbeattie to
Gatehouse of Fleet road on November 27 last year. The charge alleged Mr
Banks had been driving.
Following the verdict at Kirkcudbright Sheriff Court, Mr Banks issued
a statement saying: ''We have said from the outset that we believed that
everyone was speaking the truth. We have said this is just a simple case
of mistaken identification.''
Sheriff James Smith, in a written judgment, said the six Crown
witnesses were all credible and reliable but he had not been satisfied
on the identification issue beyond a reasonable doubt.
Charges against Mr Banks of driving without due care and attention,
resulting in the collision with a car driven by Mr Vincent Kelly, of
High Street, Gatehouse of Fleet, were also found not proven.
Sheriff Smith said that both Mr and Mrs Banks, of Maxwell House,
Corsock, Castle Douglas, had maintained that Mrs Banks was driving. He
was fully satisfied they had given a materially incorrect account of how
the accident had happened.
He said: ''But the case can be determined without expressing a view as
to whether I accept or reject the evidence of either accused, or any
view about my view of their credibility, about which I say nothing. That
is by a verdict of not proven.''
During the trial, Mr Kelly and his wife, Florence, 51, both identified
Mr Banks as being the driver, although only Mr Kelly said he saw Mr
Banks get out of the driver's door.
Sheriff Smith said: ''Given the notorious difficulties of eye-witness
identification at night, when events happen in split seconds, I cannot
say in this present instance that I have been satisfied on the
identification issue beyond a reasonable doubt, however good the
evidence.
The sheriff said one last point which favoured the accused was that
Mrs Banks was a tall, thin-faced woman with close-cropped hair. Mr Banks
was of similar height, thin, with slightly longer than average hair for
a man. Apparently their appearance was broadly similar on the date of
the accident.

AN Italian prosecutor has asked that former Prime Minister Giulio
Andreotti, already indicted on Mafia charges, be ordered to stand trial
in connection with the 1979 murder of a journalist.
The written request also asked that former Foreign Trade Minister
Claudio Vitalone and Mafia bosses Michelangelo La Barbera, Pippo Calo,
and Gaetano Badalamenti be tried in the killing.
Andreotti and Vitalone have denied any wrongdoing.
Andreotti, 76, who was premier seven times, has already been ordered
to stand trial charged with being a full member of the Sicilian Mafia.
The trial opens in Palermo on September 26.
The case against Andreotti is based in part on testimony by Mafia
turncoats including Badalamenti, who is serving a 45-year sentence in
New Jersey for the ''Pizza Connection'' heroin trafficking operation
between Sicily and the United States.
He is believed to have told investigators that the dead journalist,
Mino Pecorelli, was close to stumbling on state secrets about the 1978
murder of former premier Aldo Moro.--Reuter.

A PELICAN crossing has migrated 40 metres along a road in Stornoway,
at a cost of about #2000, after complaints from a couple outside whose
house it was being installed.
The crossing is one of two being set up by the Western Isles Islands
Council in Matheson Road to cope with the increased heavy traffic due to
lorries carrying infill material for the new #7.5m ferry terminal at
Newton Basin in the town.
The pelicans, and other restrictions, are for a six-month period only,
but may become permanent.
When workmen began erecting the barriers for the crossing outside the
home of Mr Sardar Mohammed and his wife, Sabia, at 24 Matheson Road,
they received complaints.
Mrs Mohammed said yesterday: ''I cannot understand why our house was
picked. If it was meant for the benefit of the old people in the home
down the road and for children, the place to put it was nearer the road
junction with Westview Terrace.''
Local councillor Alasdair Macrae said it had been agreed at the last
meeting of the development services committee to install the crossings,
as well as waiting restrictions on Matheson Road.

NICOSIA: Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash warned today that his
breakaway state would unite with Turkey if the European Union accepted
Greek Cypriot membership.
''The problem is not resolved by unilateral entry into the European
Union. A divided Cyprus then becomes permanent, then the north
integrates and unites with Turkey,'' he told a ceremony marking the 21st
anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.
Cyprus has been divided since the Turkish invasion of the north in
1974.
The Cypriot Government signed an agreement with the EU last month
paving the way for possible Cypriot membership by the end of the decade.

THREE British soldiers charged with killing a Danish woman in Cyprus
sat with their heads firmly turned away today as the court studied
pictures of her battered corpse.
Gruesome pictures displayed in the Cyprus Criminal court showed tour
guide Louise Jensen, 23, apparently naked, lying on her front with her
hands above her head.
Blonde hair congealed in blood covered her face, which was distorted
by blows and decomposition.
Defendants Jeff Pernell, 23, Justin Fowler, 27 and Alan Ford, 26, all
serving with the Royal Greenjackets in Cyprus, pleaded not guilty this
week to abducting, conspiring to rape, and killing Jensen after a
drinking bout at the holiday resort of Ayia Napa last September.
If convicted, they could face life imprisonment.
All three stared stonily ahead as the court studied the photographs.
During the court hearing, which lasted three-and-a-half hours, the
soldiers did not speak to one another.
The case has shocked the island, where such violence is rare, and has
thrown a harsh spotlight on the behaviour of off-duty British soldiers.
Pernell, sitting next to his lawyer Antonis Andreou, glanced at the
booklets his lawyer was leafing through but quickly turned his head away
when Andreou turned to the pictures of Jensen's body.
Police allege that on September 13, 1994, the three soldiers drove
their buggy into a motorcycle driven by Jensen's boyfriend, waiter
Michalis Vassiliades, then 21.
Vassiliades, one of the main prosecution witnesses, was told today
that he would be summoned to testify next week.
He claimed the three defendants bludgeoned Jensen's head with a spade,
tossed her into the buggy, and drove off.
Fowler's yellow Mini Moke, the vehicle allegedly used in the
abduction, was shown in photographs to have drops of blood on the metal
panelling and bloodstains on the seats. A blue towel was heaped on the
back seat soaked in blood.
Each defendant was photographed after their arrest with what appeared
to be blood-stained clothes.
Tomorrow prosecutors are expected to submit a videotape of footage
taken by police experts from the search to locate Jensen, in which the
three defendants assisted.
Defence lawyers will see the film tomorrow and then say whether they
consent to the tape being used as evidence.

THE Conservative Party reshuffled its senior office-bearers both north
and south of the Border yesterday to ready itself for future General
Election campaigning.
In Scotland, backbench MP Phil Gallie (Ayr) was appointed a
vice-chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party, replacing Aberdeen
South MP Raymond Robertson who recently became a Scottish Office
Minister.
Nationally, new party chairman Brian Mawhinney let his presence be
felt by removing novelist Michael Dobbs and former Minister John Maples
as deputy chairmen and replacing them with MPs Michael Trend and Charles
Hendry. It is thought that he agrees with backbenchers that Tory Party
Central Office had to be closer to the party in Parliament -- and
neither Mr Dobbs nor Mr Maples is an MP.
There also is a role for controversial former Minister Michael Mates,
who resigned from the Northern Ireland Office after claims that he
injudiciously gave a present of a watch engraved with ''Don't Let the
Bastards Get You Down'' to businessman Asil Nadir, who fled the country
when facing fraud charges.
He becomes part of a campaign team of six MPs, who include Mr
Sebastian Coe and Sir Archibald Hamilton.
Mr Gallie's appointment in Scotland gives him an official role at a
time when many people felt he was too outspoken ever to be part of the
party's mainstream.
However, with six of the 10 Conservative MPs in Scotland holding
ministerial office, there was little room for manoeuvre if the party
wished to continue to have an MP as vice-chairman.
Joining Mr Gallie as a vice-chairman is car dealer Jackson Carlaw, who
will be responsible for campaigning in the run-up to the election. Miss
Annabel Goldie, vice-chairman since 1992, is appointed deputy chairman.
* Former Tory Party chairman Kenneth Baker has announced that he is to
stand down as an MP at the next General Election. Mr Baker, 60, said he
wanted to concentrate on his non-political interests, including writing.
Political observers say that Mr Baker's political judgment was not
always sound, but he survived in Cabinet and senior party posts far
longer than many would have dreamed possible by his easy ability to
adapt himself to serve and to please three separate Tory leaders of all
degrees of political moistness -- soaking wet, desert dry, or rising
damp.
Mr Baker, who is as highly polished in manner as he is sleek in
appearance, served as Home Secretary, Education Secretary, and party
chairman.

CRITICS of the new Scottish Environmental Protection Agency have
pledged to work to make it a success, although some retain misgivings,
now that the Environment Act 1995 has been given Royal Assent.
The World Wide Fund for Nature Scotland said yesterday it hoped that
the creation of the agency would offer ''a glimmer of hope for better
environmental protection''.
It also warned that the agency's success would rely on the creativity
of its staff, because the Government had ''insisted that, despite its
name, the agency's role will apparently be restricted to that of a
pollution regulator''.
The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, which last year
threatened to boycott the agency's advisory group, has nominated members
to serve on it, so that it can ensure some influence on issues of
policy.
The agency, which will start next April, will bring together the
functions of HM Industrial Pollution Inspectorate, the River
Purification Authorities, and the responsibilities of councils in
respect of waste regulation and some local air pollution controls.
Other provisions in the Act include:
* regulations to protect air quality;
* powers to enforce the cleaning of contaminated land;
* powers of access to land for pollution monitoring following an oil
spill;
* A new duty for the agency to advise local authorities on flood risk.
The Act also will enable local authorities to take stringent action
within their boundaries to clamp down on traffic pollution and improve
air quality.
It also requires the Government to publish a national strategy for
improving air quality, with standards and targets for the main
pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and low-level ozone.

<HEADLINE>Labour forced on to defensive over 'U-turn' on devolution</HEADLINE>

LABOUR was forced to defend its plans for Scottish devolution last
night in the face of a wave of criticism prompted by its decision to
abandon proposals for elected regional assemblies in England.
The decision was interpreted as evidence of unease within the party
outside Scotland at the implications of constitutional reform.
Labour officials insist the party's commitment to a tax-raising
Scottish parliament remains ''iron-clad.'' Shadow Scottish Secretary
George Robertson said: ''Labour is going to deliver a Scottish
parliament and that's that.''
However, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth decribed the move as a
''humiliating U-turn'' that left Labour's devolution policy in a
''shambles.'' The Scottish Nationalists and Liberal Democrats joined in
by accusing Labour of betraying Scotland's trust.
The uproar caused by the publication of the consultation document A
Choice for England -- on the anniversary of Mr Tony Blair's election as
party leader -- forced Mr Robertson to issue a statement clarifying his
position.
The policy reversal was prepared by Shadow Home Secretary Jack Straw,
who denied there had ever been a link between plans for a Scottish
parliament and English regional assemblies.
Instead of introducing directly-elected assemblies in every region of
England as originally offered, Mr Straw now proposes to create 10
unelected ''regional chambers.'' They would not have tax-raising powers.
Elected regional assemblies would be established ''only where there is
strong popular support for them,'' Mr Straw said.
Deputy party leader John Prescott said Labour always had wanted a
''step-by-step'' approach. ''It is not a U-turn in any way,'' he said.
Mr Forsyth, appearing at a news conference with party chairman Brian
Mawhinney and Environment Secretary John Gummer, said Labour's policy on
English regional assemblies had collapsed.
He accused Labour of holding out regional assemblies for England as
the solution to the West Lothian question, which asks why Scottish MPs
should continue to be able to vote on English affairs at Westminster,
when, under a Scottish parliament, English MPs would be unable to vote
on Scottish affairs.
''Now Labour have no answer at all,'' Mr Forsyth said.
However, Mr Robertson, who began the day by welcoming the policy with
a short statement, chose to respond to the attacks with a more detailed
rebuttal of the claim that devolution for Scotland was under threat.
He disinguished between the clear demand for constitutional change in
Scotland and Wales and its relative absence as an issue in England. He
challenged Mr Forsyth on the ''red herring'' of the West Lothian
question by raising the Irish example.
''What about the 'West Belfast question'? Is there going to be any
change in the voting rights of Northern Ireland MPs as a result of the
new Assembly planned for Northern Ireland?
''And if not, why should there be any change in the voting rights of
Scottish MPs?''
However, SNP leader Alex Salmond said the decision left Labour's
constitutional policies ''intellectually flawed and politically
untenable''.
He added: ''No-one in their right mind in Scotland can now trust
Labour to keep to their Scottish commitments when they have in the space
of six short months effectively kicked into touch any plans to establish
regional assemblies in England.''
The Liberal Democrats said the policy shift had damaged the prospect
of constitutional reform. Constitutional affairs spokesman Robert
Maclennan said: ''Labour's claim to favour radical reform of our system
of government looks pretty tattered after today's announcement.''

History is repeating itself in the Balkans, argues Dr Tom Gallagher,
lecturer at Bradford University
BRITAIN is unlikely to show willingness to abandon its dishonourable
course on Bosnia at today's London meeting. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the
Foreign Secretary, insists that little can be done as the rebel Serbs
clinch their war aims, other than to send food to refugees.
For three years, Britain has set the terms by which the international
community has viewed this conflict. The arms embargo on the Sarajevo
Government has been defended tenaciously, even at the cost of poisoning
relations with Washington.
The conflict is viewed as an ethnic civil war even though the Sarajevo
Government is committed to multi-culturalism and has the allegiance of
tens of thousands of Serbs. It was Britain's historic preference for
partitioning territories as a crude form of conflict management that lay
behind Lord Owen's 1993 peace plan which awarded to Radovan Karadzic
huge swathes of territory cleansed of its Muslim inhabitants.
Why has the British-led international response rewarded the guilty and
punished the innocent at every turn? The answer is less to do with Mr
John Major's parochial vision, Mr Rifkind's hard-nosed lawyer approach,
or Mr Douglas Hurd's chilly disdain for Europe's lesser breeds. It is
long-term Foreign Office responses towards Eastern Europe which have
shaped policy in the Balkans.
For more than a century, the accepted wisdom in Whitehall has been
that the disorderly eastern half of Europe needed stern regional
policemen who, in order to rule effectively, should be unfettered by any
democratic constraints.
This value-free policy towards Europe's Wild East had its genesis in
Britain's stubborn backing for the nineteenth century Ottoman Sultans.
It was seen at its most brazen when Chamberlain forced democratic
Czechoslovakia to surrender to Hitler at Munich in 1938.
It got another outing at Yalta in 1944 with the abandonment of Poland
and the Danubian states to Stalin.
Information trickling out of the Russian archives suggests that the
Kremlin's strength east of the Elbe was exaggerated and that tougher
Western action could have saved parts of the region from communism.
But not a few diplomatic mandarins (non-communist one and all) found
the Soviet Empire a tidier concept than a swarm of troublesome
post-Versailles states from the Baltic to the Black Sea.
Lord Owen will not relish being reminded that his time as British
Foreign Secretary witnessed an example of appeasing Eastern tyranny,
crass even by London standards. In 1978, he smoothed the way for a state
visit to Britain by Nicholae Ceausescu, dictator of Romania, who was
installed as a guest in Buckingham Palace and made a member of the
select Order of the Bath.
History shows that Britain is comfortable with Balkan tyranny and has
a long track-record of sustaining it in the erroneous belief that ''the
wild and fanatical'' Balkan tribes will respond only to arbitrary rule.
In his last three years as Foreign Secretary, Mr Hurd probably enjoyed
closer relations with Slobadan Milosevic, the Serbian despot, than with
any other figure in the region. He has even shielded the man who ordered
the shelling of Vukovar and Dubrovnik in 1991 from accusations of war
crimes.
Milosevic may have plunged his country into civil war in order to defy
the tide of democracy advancing across Eastern Europe after 1989. He may
have destroyed the idea of a multi-cultural Yugoslavia to create an
ethnic state where his soldiers and gunmen terrorised and expelled any
and all who did not fit into the new order.
However, when the chips were down, he still had the biggest army and
police force in the Balkans and the ruthlessness to deploy them where
necessary.
To the mandarins in London, convinced that states ought to pursue
their own self-interest as determined by their geopolitical situation,
it just went to show that the stability of the region needed a satisfied
Serbia.
Palmerston, Disraeli, and Sir Edward Gray subsidised the Balkan
despotism to protect Britain's route to India. Today, Mr Hurd and Mr
Rifkind have dusted off old Balkan position papers in Whitehall to
enable Britain ''to punch above its weight'', retain a seat on the UN
Security Council, and kill off any plans for a common EU foreign policy.
Meanwhile, key democratic principles are placed in jeopardy by
Britain's misconduct in the Balkans: protection of minorities, settling
disputes on the basis of justice, belief in the idea of a multi-ethnic
state.
World opinion is on the side of the Bosnian Government and wonders why
Nato's superior weaponry and trained forces cannot be used to save
defenceless civilians.
Arguably, Mr Major's Britain is a greater threat to Balkan stability
than even the unholy trio of Milosevic, Karadzic, and Mladic. Unless
those states tricked by Britain's allegedly superior knowledge of the
Balkans come quickly to their senses, a new world order based on terror
and lawlessness may be about to be born.

<HEADLINE>Tate &amp; Lyle plans end of 250-year Scots link with switch to London plant.  Bitter blow from sugar firm</HEADLINE>

THE West of Scotland was on the brink of losing another industrial
landmark last night with Tate &amp; Lyle announcing a proposal to shut its
sugar refinery at Greenock.
Its likely closure, in 1997, will mean redundancy for almost 170
workers and the end of Greenock as the town of ''sugar and ships''.
If Tate &amp; Lyle ratifies plans to transfer production to its factory in
London, the only other sugar refinery in Britain, a 250-year tradition
at the UK birthplace of sugar refining will end.
Shipbuilding has long since ceased to be a feature of the Greenock
docks, although Ferguson's yard at Port Glasgow nearby has been
relatively successful in recent years.
Tate &amp; Lyle blamed yesterday's announcement on the need to cut
operating costs, under pressure from refining competitors in Europe, and
from British Sugar, which processes sugar beet.
It said expansion at the Thames plant would require investment of #8m,
against #15m at Greenock, and said the proposed rationalisation would
save a further #3m in annual expenditure.
Mr John Walker, managing director of Tate &amp; Lyle Sugars, said in a
statement: ''I deeply regret the distress and anxiety this will cause
our employees and their families. We have begun full consultation and
will take a final decision only when this process is concluded.''
The company, which was part-founded by the Lyle family early this
century, closed its Walker refinery in Greenock in 1979, leaving only
the Westburn refinery in production. Acquired by the firm in 1976, the
latter will celebrate a century of near-continuous operation next year.
Tate &amp; Lyle said that, even if it closed the refinery, its United
Molasses import and distribution terminal, which employs nine people in
the town, would remain.
Ms Patricia Jamieson, raw sugar divisional director, admitted that the
announcement had caused ''shock and distress'' among the workforce but
said an exhaustive review by the company had identified no viable
options other than closure.
If that decision was finalised, she said, staff would be offered
''generous'' redundancy payments of four times the statutory minimum,
and opportunities for vocational retraining.
However, the news received a predictably angry response. MEP Hugh
McMahon said he was ''absolutely incensed'' at the decision which, he
forecast, would also undermine employment for hundreds of associated
workers in Greenock.
''Tate &amp; Lyle has taken good profits from the people of the town over
many years but it is now behaving like a typical multinational company.
This will have a knock-on effect in the local food and drinks
industry.''
The leader of Inverclyde district, Councillor Harry Mulholland, said:
''It's devastating and we are extremely disappointed, especially at a
time when we have been working hard to attract other companies to the
area.''
Mr Jim Elsby, Scottish secretary designate of the TGWU, which
represents most of the Greenock workforce, said the union would be
examining the company's financial figures and hoped to mount a campaign
to overturn the proposal.

ADNAN launched into an untidy swan dive just as the mortar round
smashed into a nearby house.
''I told you I didn't feel like coming this evening,'' he spluttered
to his brother as he pulled himself from the water on the safer bank of
the river Miljacka, which runs through the heart of shell-shattered
Sarajevo.
His brother Rusmir laughed: ''It's a crazy life. You come to have a
bath and they shell you.''
The five youths gathered near the city library to escape the
oppressive heat by swimming in a spot known sardonically by residents as
Sarajevo's ''beach''.
For most city dwellers, besieged for more than three years by the
Bosnian Serbs, the sea and the sand of the Adriatic coast 120 miles away
is a memory no more real to them than hopes for peace.
Even the little act of make-believe that allowed them last year to
transform a rocky river bank and the dirty water of the Miljacka into a
sun-soaked paradise has been spoiled by the return of daily violence to
the city.
A Nato ultimatum that protected Sarajevo last year is now ignored and
a Bosnian Government offensive to ease the siege has prompted deadly
random fire into the city by Bosnian Serbs.
''There are none of our friends here, no people at all, it was much
better last year,'' said Nermin, 18. ''We come here with a lot of
fear.''
Boredom, frustration, and the heat drove them to risk swimming in full
view of gun positions on the hills above, ignoring the danger with the
weary nonchalance Sarajevans affect to help them get through their daily
lives.
Nearby, a boy in swimming trunks hobbled away on his crutch towards
shelter. A girl picked up two small dogs, held them to her chest and
stood still, trying to decide which way to run if another shell fell
close.
Two mothers with babies scooped them from their prams and waited for a
moment. The dust settled and they continued their stroll with the
terrifying acceptance of risk which appears so insane to outsiders and
is the norm for city residents.
Adnan laughed when asked if his parents knew where he was.
''We sneak out here,'' said the dark-haired boy who looked younger
than his 17 years. ''We get scolded but we come anyway.
''It'll just happen that one morning our mothers will open the back
pages of Oslobodenje and see our pictures there,'' he said. His friends
guffawed at the thought of appearing in the obituary columns of the
daily newspaper.
Another shell fell, rattling the tiles on nearby roofs, and the boys
finally scattered, gathering up their clothes and running to a nearby
cave to change and go home. ''We'll tell our parents we were fetching
water,'' said one. -- Reuter

A GROOM charged with murdering millionaire racehorse trainer Alex
Scott yesterday returned to the scene of the shooting.
William O'Brien, 58, had elected to be present when the jury was shown
the spot in a stud farm barn where an alleged confrontation between the
two men happened.
The seven men and five women arrived by coach for what they had been
told was effectively the second day of the trial of Mr O'Brien, who is
charged with murdering Mr Scott, 34, on September 30 last year.
The judge, Mr Justice Blofeld, prosecuting counsel James Hunt, and
defence counsel Christopher Leigh, had arrived separately at the Glebe
Stud, Cheveley, near Newmarket, Suffolk.
When the trial opened at Norwich Crown Court on Wednesday, Mr O'Brien
denied the murder. Mr Hunt told the jury the defence would argue that he
was not guilty on the grounds of provocation.
Mr O'Brien also pled not guilty to threatening to kill a gardener at
the stud, Christopher Forster.
Yesterday Mr O'Brien arrived in a Ford Cortina minicab with a black
plastic bin-liner over his head, sitting between two prison officers.
Moments later the bin-liner had been removed and he looked relaxed and
smiling as he stood between the officers a few yards from the bungalow
he and his wife lived in until the night of the shooting.
Dressed in open-necked check shirt and green trousers, he watched as
the judge showed the jury around the group of buildings where Mr Scott
met his death.
The court heard on Wednesday that Mr Scott -- who trained horses owned
by the ruling Maktoum family of Dubai, including this year's Derby
winner Lammtarra -- had gone to see Mr O'Brien to arrange his departure
after a row.
During the argument a few days earlier, Mr O'Brien -- described as a
workaholic who had developed a deep resentment for Mr Scott -- had told
his employer to ''stuff his job''.
Mr Scott, a father of three young children, had written requesting
that Mr O'Brien confirm his resignation in writing. Having received no
reply, he went to see Mr O'Brien, accompanied by the gardener, Mr
Forster.
Yesterday the judge took the jury into the steel and breeze-block
barn, about 60ft by 20ft, used for the stabling of seven mares,
particularly at foaling time on the stud.
He showed them the ''sitting up room'', where Mr O'Brien -- who had
worked at the stud for 10 years -- would stay when mares were expected
to foal, to give them any necessary care.
Inside, most of the furniture used by Mr O'Brien had gone, but the
jury saw the large walk-in cupboard used for veterinary equipment and
where the jury was told he had allegedly put the single-barrelled
12-bore shotgun used to kill Mr Scott.
At one stage during the argument, Mr Scott appeared to have been
knocked to the floor and was then shot in the back, the prosecution
said.
The trial continues.

Are the Western allies ready to unleash their jets on the Bosnian
Serbs? James McKillop reports on a high-risk strategy
AT long last, the United Nations is talking tough and there was every
indication last night that this is no bluff.
Any attempt by the Bosnian Serbs to take the Gorazde safe haven will
put the UN on a war footing and unleash what will certainly be the
biggest air offensive since the Gulf war.
A senior Royal Air Force officer yesterday did not attempt to play
down the growing crisis in former Yugoslavia.
''We are talking about serious air power now,'' I was told. ''The
Bosnian Serbs cannot possibly imagine what they are likely to face if
they continue their offensive towards Gorazde.
''Up until now, aircraft have hardly been used on ground attack
missions in Bosnia. All that will change if the politicians give the
go-ahead at the London conference.''
For the first time in this conflict, aircraft will be called upon to
fulfil their proper role.
It will be a high-risk strategy. Nobody has any doubt about that.
Minor attacks on ammunition dumps in the past led to UN troops being
held hostage.
With the air attacks of the kind now envisaged, the Serbs can be
expected to attempt further hostage taking, at least. They are more
likely to go further.
It is more likely that from the first bombardment they will regard the
UN as a legitimate enemy and the Serbs will take every opportunity to
shoot at blue helmets, particularly in vulnerable areas.
The allies are well aware that the stakes are high but last night
there was every indication that if the Serb advance continues political
leaders will be prepared to take it on the chin. Casualties could be
high.
If the politicians put their money where there mouths are at today's
London conference and the Bosnians push on towards Gorazde, wave after
wave of aircraft will take off from airfields in Italy and from carriers
in the Adriatic under orders to attack specific targets.
Up until now, their major role has been to mount operation Deny Flight
-- a spurious attempt to halt combatants in theatre flying aircraft.
During the Gulf war, enemy positions were pounded round the clock day
after day, week after week.
A similar strategy can be expected in Bosnia Herzegovina, albeit on a
much smaller scale.
From the outset, Nato commanders will draw a line on the map around
the Gorazde pocket which the Serbs will be warned they dare not cross.
Military chiefs know they will face no opposition from enemy aircraft.
Their primary targets in the initial stages therefore will be the
Bosnian air defences.
The lesson of US fighter pilot Scott O'Grady, rescued last month after
being shot down by the Serbs, will not go unheeded. The American pilot
stayed too long in an area after his sensors had picked up the message
that enemy radar had locked on to his aircraft.
Allied commanders will want to minimise the risk of a recurrence of
that incident by taking out enemy air defences at the outset.
Unquestionably, the UN has accurate detailed intelligence as to their
whereabouts.
Even though many of them may be situated close to populated areas,
this need not be an insurmountable problem. The allied commanders will
be sufficiently confident that smart bombs can take out specific targets
without causing serious civilian casualties, or in military speak
without causing collateral damage.
Similarly, any Serb command and control centre identified by the
allies will be attacked in the early stages. The UN will also attempt to
disrupt communications by attacking power stations and telephone
exchanges.
The aircraft would then turn their attention to troops advancing on
Gorazde and it would not be a question of taking out one or two tanks.
There are few routes into the Gorazde pocket, and the town itself.
At an early stage, the UN air forces would take out bridges. Almost
certainly this would result in a huge pile-up of tanks which would then
become easy targets. It is unlikely that there would be any friendly
forces or too many civilians in the vicinity of such attacks.
In these circumstances, the Serbs would face the prospect of
horrendous losses.
''It will certainly be a proper use of aircraft,'' the RAF source
said. ''The pilots will know their targets before they take off and they
will be supremely confident that will be able to do the job.''
The UN already has more than sufficient assets in the area to instil
confidence.
In a scenario of the kind envisaged, it is impossible to say exactly
which aircraft would be involved. Everything would be up for grabs.
The United Kingdom alone has six Tornado fighters, seven Jaguar ground
attack, and two Jaguar reconnaissance based at Gioia del Colle in Italy.
The Jaguars are to be replaced within days by GR7 Harriers from Germany
-- the RAF's most modern planes. In addition, Sea Harriers from HMS
Illustrious in the Adriatic would be involved.
British aircraft are supported by two Tristar air-to-air refuelling
tankers which are based in Palermo, Sicily.
The Americans have a huge range of fighters and dual-role aircraft,
including F-16s and ground attack aircraft such as the A-10 based at
Aviano in Italy. They also have F/A-18C dual-role aircraft and F-14
aircraft on their carrier in the Adriatic.
The French have Mirage fighter aircraft, Jaguars, the Super Entendard
fighter-bomber, and ground attack planes based at Istrana and Cervia air
bases in Italy. They too have an aircraft carrier, the Foch in the
Adriatic.
The Dutch have fighters at Villafranca, as do the Turks at Ghedi, and
the Spanish at Vicenza. All these bases are in Italy.
In short, the military has more than sufficient aircraft to achieve
whatever objective may be decided by their political masters in London
today.
The mood of the chiefs of staff in the UK, America, and France was
uncompromising.
The Serbs have called the bluff of the United Nations once too often.
They are demanding that whatever happens at today's conference, the
Bosnian Serbs should be left in no doubt that if they continue their
offensive with an attack against Gorazde then they will come under
terrifying UN air fire. It could be of such ferocity as to change the
whole course of the war.

Brussels
A FRESH row between the European Commission and the British Government
broke out yesterday when UK Ministers were accused of blocking EU aid
payments to increase employment.
Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner, said part of the UK's
entitlement of #1200m over six years was being held up by the Government
because it was changing the conditions on how the money would be spent.
A spokesman for Mr Flynn's office said yesterday: ''We cannot allow
the United Kingdom to act unilaterally in this way.''
The commission's anger at Britain was made known in a memorandum
circulated to members of the European Parliament but not otherwise
published. It referred to UK organisations contacting the commission
because their payments -- made through UK agencies, including Scottish
Enterprise and local enterprise companies -- were late.
Organisations involved include many in the voluntary sector working
under the aegis of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations.
Mr Hugh McMahon, Labour's social affairs spokesman in the European
Parliament, said that the SCVO was #5m down on its entitlements because
of payment delays caused by the Department of Employment.
''It is an absolute scandal and a disgrace that the Government is
behaving like this,'' Mr McMahon said.
''They are robbing the people these funds are intended for by keeping
the money in the bank and creaming off the interest.'' Mr Flynn's
comments follow reports last month that Mr Michael Portillo, Employment
Secretary until the recent Cabinet reshuffle, had blocked #40m from the
European Social Fund.
Unity Enterprise, a charitable company run by churches in Scotland,
was reported to be another of the victims of the delays after the
Department of Employment sought late changes to eligibility rules for
funding.

<HEADLINE>'Hire a lawyer' memo over Skye ferry withdrawal</HEADLINE>

THE Government has told its own Scottish transport watchdog body to
hire a lawyer to tell it whether it has the legal right to call a public
inquiry into the withdrawal of the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry to Skye
when the new bridge opens this autumn.
The issue could end in court action. Local opponents of the bridge
said last night they would consider mounting a legal challenge if the
Government insists the service is withdrawn without the public being
consulted as they would be over a rail closure.
Mr Charles Kennedy, the Ross, Cromarty, and Skye MP, is backing the
move and called on the Rail Users Consultative Committee for Scotland to
defend its powers by taking the matter to the Court of Session.
Mrs Kathleen MacRae, treasurer of the Skye Bridge Appeal Group, said
yesterday: ''If the legislation which purports to safeguard the
travelling public's interests does not extend to ferry passengers the
same rights of redress as it does to rail passengers, then clearly it is
seriously flawed and has to be challenged.
''Obviously it would be very difficult financially for a group like
ours to take legal action but we would have to consider it.
''Withdrawing a rail service is bad enough but ferries provide
lifelines to islands and, if anything, should be the more carefully
protected.
''If the right is conceded in Skye it could be very serious for other
communities in the future.''
Herald sources have indicated that, earlier this year, the Scottish
Office accepted that the RUCCS, established by the 1993 Railways Act,
did have the right to call ferry inquiries.
However, Mr John Watts, Transport Minister, believes it does not have
the right, and that its predecessor bodies never had it either, despite
having exercised it unchallenged for more than 30 years.
That right apparently refers only to the rail element in the
committee's work.
Nevertheless, Mr Watts does not appear completely confident about the
exact legal position: ''You will appreciate that this represents the
Department's (of Transport) view and is not offered as an authoritative
interpretation of the law. It is for the committee to obtain such legal
advice as it considers necessary in order that it may be fully informed
of the position.''

AS THE housing officer peered through the letterbox, he could manage a
partial sighting of the bedroom; then thought he could see a leg.
Alarmed, he contacted the police. With the help of an emergency
joiner, they broke down the door of the eighth-floor flat in the
Anderston district of Glasgow and found the body of 75-year-old Malcolm
Boyes. He had been dead for eight months.
His Christmas mail bore poignant testimony to the fact that some
people at one stage had cared, even just a little.
The news shocked a warm-hearted city yesterday. How could it have
happened? Where were the caring agencies? Where was his family? As
answers to these questions were being sought, a son who had not seen his
father for 10 years contacted the housing department.
A police spokesperson said: ''The deceased does have a family but it
does not appear as if they were very close. I don't think they've been
in contact for a long time. They have been notified.''
A post-mortem examination is expected to take place today or early
next week but there are thought to be no suspicious circumstances.
The dead man lived in a 14-storey block with a concierge service.
Staff are on hand to provide round-the-clock help and assistance to
tenants on request.
In some cases, particularly where tenants are elderly or vulnerable,
staff are in regular contact, either at the request of the tenant or at
the request of social workers or health visitors.
An official of Glasgow District Council said: ''A lot of the tenants
aren't known to concierge staff. If the tenants want to keep themselves
to themselves then they are allowed to do so.
''Some tenants request that the concierge staff keep an eye on them,
others don't. Mr Boyes seemed to be a very quiet gentleman who went
about his own business. We don't want to interfere with tenants'
privacy.''
The director of housing, Mr David Comley, said: ''We very much regret
Mr Boyes's death and the fact that it has taken so long for his body to
be found, but we do not accept any blame.''
Strathclyde's social work department had allocated him a home help
after a fall more than a year ago, but on his recovery he terminated the
service. An official said: ''He appeared to be an independent gentleman
who liked to do things for himself.''
Neighbours and friends in the local Pot Black bar thought he might
have moved away or been admitted to hospital. Even when his pension was
not cashed, it failed to alert society that something had gone wrong
with Mr Boyes.
An official of the Benefits Agency said that many old people were
admitted to hospital or went on holiday for many months at a time --
visiting relatives abroad, for example. The fact they they had not
cashed pension vouchers for serveral months would not trigger any alarm
bells.
The discovery shocked local people. Mr Stephen Malloy, a barman at the
Pot Black where Mr Boyes used to be a regular, said: ''We have a free
pensioners' party at Christmas and we put a note through his door, but
he has not been seen for a while. We thought he had gone away or moved,
and we think he was supposed to have had a home help.
''But everybody is annoyed with themselves that we did not go round
and double-check. We were all shocked when we heard about this from one
of the neighbours.''
For the senior Glasgow Conservative, Bailie John Young, the Boyes case
highlighted the desocialising effect of multi-storey living. He said:
''I think this tragedy highlights what often happens in tower blocks.
While several hundred people may be in close proximity, in actual fact
it can be a very lonely situation for people on their own.''

TIME is being called on pubs in Edinburgh under a major
re-organisation of closing times which also includes discotheques.
Later this month, the city's licensing board will hear recommendations
that pubs should close at 1am, with discos shutting their doors at 3am.
It follows representations from a consultative group involving the
district council, the licensed trade, and a report from the Chief
Constable of Lothian and Borders Police who last year expressed disquiet
about the increase in violence in Edinburgh involving early morning
revellers.
A similar programme in Glasgow, which led to the imposition of the
so-called ''curfew'', is now said to have reduced violence considerably.
In Edinburgh, police have had to provide extra patrols in certain
areas of the city. A Lothian and Borders Police spokesman said
yesterday: ''It is significant that the chief constable commented in his
report that while crime had decreased there was an increase in violence
and the licensing hours were thought to have played a part in that.
Consequently, we were party to being involved in the consultative
report.''

THE bookmakers Ladbroke yesterday announced 200 job losses and blamed
them on the success of the national lottery and instant scratch-cards.
Nine workers from the company's Scottish headquarters at Grangemouth
are among those to be made redundant. Most of the other cutbacks will
affect Ladbroke's head office staff.
The announcement came two days after predictions by an independent
forecaster that the lottery's spectacular entrance could force the
closure of 2000 British betting shops, with the loss of 6500 jobs.
Ladbroke Racing's managing director, Mr Christopher Bell, said
yesterday: ''It is extremely unfortunate that we have had to take this
action, but the impact of the national lottery, particularly since the
launch of the instants scratch-cards in March, has created difficult
trading conditions.''
The gambling-to-hotels parent group said that turnover this year had
fallen 8% short of its forecasts, around three-quarters of which could
be blamed on the lottery.
Ladbroke Racing, which has nearly 14,000 people in its betting
operations, takes around a quarter of the #6000m staked annually in
Britain's 9300 betting shops.

<HEADLINE>MPs' report highlights overstretched system. 7000 cases dropped by court</HEADLINE>

MORE than 7000 criminal cases, which would normally be prosecuted,
were dropped because Glasgow District Court had insufficient capacity to
deal with them in a reasonable time.
Among the charges abandoned at the court last year by the
procurator-fiscal because of time delays were 365 assault cases, 1646
breach of the peace charges, 985 thefts, five vandalism cases, and two
cases of indecent behaviour. Around 3592 road traffic and parking
offences were also dropped. The lost revenue in fines alone is believed
to total around #250,000.
In Scotland, 290,091 reports were received by procurators-fiscal
covering 49 areas of the country and no proceedings were marked on
44,974 of them, around 15.5% of the total.
The figures for Glasgow District Court, revealed in a House of Commons
Public Accounts Committee report, were condemned last night by leading
politicians, lawyers, and victim support groups.
Mrs Alison Paterson, director of Victim Support Scotland, whose
organisation help more than 40,000 people a year, said the news was a
real ''kick in the teeth'' to the innocent victims of crime. She said
the court system was clogged up, under-resourced, over-stretched, and
showed a lack of care and concern for the victim.
The accounts committee looked into the whole issue of the Scottish
courts and prosecution service. It revealed thousands of criminal cases
were dropped because courts could not cope with them.
It also showed ''inefficiencies'' in the sheriff courts which meant
seven out of nine trials did not go ahead on the date originally
planned.
The average waiting time for cases coming to court is still three
weeks above the target of around 12 weeks set down by the Scottish
Courts Administration six years ago. At Glasgow Sheriff Court, the
busiest in Scotland, the time delay can be as long as 26 weeks.
The cost to the police of such delays is running at between #7m and
#9m, not including juries, witnesses, and lawyers. The committee said it
was ''concerned'' at the 15.5% of cases which had no proceedings marked
against them.
In Glasgow, the fiscal received 69,451 reports and 18,938 had no
proceedings marked against them. In the district court, 7089 cases which
would normally have been prosecuted were delayed to such an extent that
the procurator-fiscal considered it was no longer in the public interest
to proceed. The committee said that situation was ''unsatisfactory''.
The report stated: ''It cannot be right that alleged offences are not
prosecuted for reasons unconnected with the circumstances of the cases
or the quality of the evidence.''
Labour MP Mike Watson, who is on the accounts committee, criticised
the figures, particularly the situation at Glasgow District Court, and
said they undermined the whole legal system.
Mr Watson said he would be monitoring the situation at the district
court and wanted firm evidence things were improving. He accepted the
number of cases not being proceeded with in Glasgow had since fallen but
said the problem had to be eradicated completely.
''I want firm evidence that the situation is in hand,'' said Mr
Watson. ''The cases at Glasgow District Court may have dropped over the
last two months but that is not good enough. One case being dropped
because of insufficient capacity at the court is one too many.''
His committee colleague, Liberal Democrat MP Robert Maclennan, said
Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth must take urgent action to remedy the
problems.
''We are seeing unacceptable delays and failures to use the courts
effectively,'' said Mr Maclennan. ''This is a serious failure of
administration and the Scottish people are entitled to a court system
which brings people to trial promptly.''
Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond said he had been given
details of the frustrations of the court system from his constituents,
particularly those involved at Peterhead Sheriff Court. He was very
concerned at the high levels of cases not going ahead.
Lawyer Cameron Fyfe of Ross Harper and Murphy said the figures were
shocking and if they got any worse there would be a crisis in the court
system in Glasgow.
Mr Fyfe said: ''The police will concede it is difficult enough to
catch criminals on crimes like housebreaking. To hear those involved
have a chance of not going to court because of delays is an incentive to
criminals to go out and commit a crime, as many will think they have a
chance the case may never come to court.''
The Crown Office said last night it had been aware of the difficulties
at Glasgow District Court and had put a new structure into place. There
had been no cases dropped because of insufficient capacity during May
and June.

THE Glasgow Development Agency has been accused of taking undue credit
for a major new hotel initiative.
The directors of the Tower Hotel Group, developers of the 282-bedroom
Charing Cross Tower Hotel project, are furious at the wording of a
passage in the GDA's annual report.
The paragraph reads: ''The Budget Hotel Initiative aimed to encourage
the private sector to provide 650 beds in budget hotels by July 1995. So
far, 592 beds have been, or are being, provided . . .''
Mr Hugh Deans, hotel company director, said almost half of the 592
beds referred to were in the #4.8m Charing Cross hotel, where rooms cost
#38.50.
Fellow director Bill Forbes said: ''The final insult was GDA claiming
credit for something it did not do.'' He has written to GDA chief
executive Stuart Gulliver, asking him to explain the ''exaggerated
claim''.
A GDA spokesman said the annual report clearly stated that the hotel
initiative was aimed at encouraging the private sector to provide beds,
which it succeeded in doing.
He added: ''GDA financed research, which was made available to private
companies, demonstrated there was a gap in that particular market.''

A COUPLE, who claim that their 19-year-old brain damaged daughter was
raped by a man in a residential respite home, are set to take legal
action against Fife Regional Council.
The family, who live in the St Andrews area, have accused staff at the
council-run complex of being negligent and say the incident has left
their teenage daughter ''devastated''.
The girl's father said the girl, who has a mental age of 10, had
suffered increasingly from epileptic fits since her ordeal and was now
upset ''very easily''. He said: ''We are all in no doubt that she was
raped by this man. She keeps talking about 'that bad man' and is
convinced she is going to have a baby.''
The family are furious that staff bathed their daughter after the
alleged incident, destroying any possible evidence, and sent her off to
a council-run training centre for the day.
They also claim staff gave their daughter a ''morning-after''
contraceptive pill and have expressed concern that they were not
notified of the alleged early-morning attack until some hours later.
An internal inquiry has already been held by senior officials of the
region's social work department but has failed to satisfy the family,
who say its findings leave many questions unanswered. The girl's father
said yesterday: ''No-one has officially apologised to us. It is a
disgrace and we are now taking legal advice.''
The girl's parents have stressed that they declined to have the police
involved because it would have caused their daughter more trauma.
Fife's social work department has apologised for not contacting the
girl's parents earlier and the confusion surrounding the whole issue. It
said there was to be a review of internal procedures.
It is understood that staff at the centre have been issued with new
guidelines to advise parents and carers immediately of any incidents.
A Fife Police spokesman said: ''We are aware of such an alleged
incident at the home and a report has been submitted to the
procurator-fiscal.''

SCOTS aid worker Nikkie du Preez left Edinburgh in her car yesterday
personally to deliver #5000 in cash to Bosnia.
Ms du Preez chose to travel alone in her Citreon with the money in a
suitcase as she felt it was the easiest, quickest, and safest way to get
the money to the people who needed it most.
When she arrives in five days, the money will be handed over to the
President of the Independent Association of Trade Unions in Tuzla,
Fikreta, andSijercic. It will be spent on providing aid for refugees
from Srebrenica.
Ms du Preez, of aid group Bosnia Now, explained she felt it was easier
to take the cash personally in her car rather than getting it there in
other ways.
She said: ''I decided to travel alone because in Bosnia and Croatia,
women don't really matter and they can travel more freely.
''In Bosnia, the international currency is Deutschmark and I have
around #5000 worth in my car. Men get stopped a lot in Bosnia but women
don't. I decided not to take a companion because travelling alone I will
not attract much attention.''
Meanwhile, Scottish European Aid director, Ms Liz McLaughlin, has
flown to Bosnia to help with the relief effort. Scot Murray Butchard
from Edinburgh is in Tuzla helping the water and sanitation efforts
there.
Oxfam yesterday made an impassioned plea to the Government to take
immediate and ''robust'' steps to protect the people of Bosnia in the
remaining ''safe areas''.
Deputy director John Whitaker, who has just returned from Tuzla,
handed a letter to No 10 while accompanied by a group of colleagues
holding placards which read ''Don't break your promise to Bosnia''.
In the letter, also signed by two other Oxfam officials, Mr Whitaker
said the plight of the refugees from Srebrenica made a mockery of the
term ''safe area''.
He wrote: ''Oxfam firmly believes that all civilians have a right to
protection from violence.
''It is not too late to save tens of thousands of people from murder
and ethnic cleansing by taking robust steps to protect the people
remaining in the safe areas and to ensure that we can continue to supply
aid to those people.''
Mr Whitaker, speaking outside Downing Street, described the situation
in Tuzla where thousands of refugees are camped as ''pretty bloody''.
He added: ''It is not life-threatening but there is quite a high risk
of disease and sickness. Resources are very stretched.''
In Sarajevo, Bosnian Serbs yesterday agreed to allow humanitarian aid
into the city but a UN official said the concession was a ploy to defuse
international pressure to use force to secure an alternative aid route.
Two convoys with 540 tonnes of food are planned for the route today in
a test of the new policy.
A UN official, who asked not to be named, said the Serbs had relented
to deflect growing international pressure to use military force to
secure an alternate aid route that passes through government territory
but comes under Serb fire.
''Essentially they (Bosnian Serbs) are trying to pull the plug on
efforts to open any other routes into Sarajevo and hoping to defuse
tension,'' said the official.
''There remains the question whether they are going to allow 6000
tonnes a month into Sarajevo.''
Separatist Serb forces surrounding Sarajevo have blocked most
humanitarian aid into the city ever since they closed the airport to
relief flights more than three months ago.
Serb authorities placed impossible conditions on use of the
traditional land route for convoys into the city, including a ban on UN
military escorts for the trucks.

AFTER more than 10 years, Radio Clyde has lost the exclusive rights to
broadcast live Scottish League football on a Saturday afternoon.
Arch-rivals Scot FM yesterday announced a deal for the Bell's League
Championship and the Coca-Cola Cup during the forthcoming season.
The deal, which will not affect BBC Radio Scotland's live football
coverage, cost the fledgling station little more than #150,000 a season
for the next two years. It is regarded as a cornerstone of Scot FM's
fight for improved listening figures.
At its height, Radio Clyde's Super Scoreboard attracted more than
350,000 listeners -- by far its most popular programme -- and, more
importantly, brought in high revenue from advertising as well as a top
sponsorship deal from Tennents, the brewers.
Scot FM is now looking for sponsorship for its live Saturday sports
coverage, which could mean Tennents moving its involvement to the new
programme. The arrangement will involve a substantial investment in both
personnel and live-broadcast equipment.
Despite Scot FM's announcement, Radio Clyde maintained yesterday that
it was continuing to negotiate with the Scottish football authorities
''for some realism in their charges''. Still up for grabs, after all, is
radio coverage of the Tennents Scottish Cup. But Clyde seems unlikely to
match Scot FM's #150,000a-season fee.
Clyde's programme director, Mr Alex Dickson, said: ''What (the League)
is selling is not the same product which was the fixture card of last
season but a card with at least 23 games moved from Saturdays at the
behest of television.
''Radio suffers as a consequence. The Saturday afternoon bill of fare
will not be as attractive but, for some reason beyond understanding, the
Scottish football authorities want to charge more money than ever
before. The logic and the fairness of this, never mind the good business
sense, escapes us.''
Scot FM's managing director, Mr Tom Hunter, described the deal as
''the biggest thing to happen to us since our launch last September''.
The new deal will clearly be a massive blow to Radio Clyde which,
until now, has been the leading commercial player in live football
coverage. Clyde Super Scoreboard was a huge moneyspinner for the
station, syndicated to commercial stations up and down the country. But
it is a blow which Clyde appears to be prepared to sustain.
The new deal, which is initially for two years, gives Scot FM
commercial rights to live second-half commentary for 41 Bell's League or
Coca-Cola Cup matches, full commentary for the Coca-Cola Cup Final, and
live updates from Bell's League Championship matches in each of the four
divisions.
Mr Yule Craig, president of the Scottish Football League, said: ''We
were impressed with Scot FM's enthusiastic approach to the game and the
coverage they plan for an important new season in Scotland.''

Sarajevo
SURVIVORS of the Muslim flight from Srebrenica yesterday accused
separatist Serb soldiers of wearing UN uniforms and blue helmets and
luring refugees to their deaths along the way.
The accounts, which could not be confirmed independently, said the
Serbs called the unsuspecting refugees out of the woods where they were
hiding, lined them up, and shot them.
UN aid offical Kris Janowski in Sarajevo recounted the allegations by
a group of refugees who fled through the forest in a desperate bid for
safety from advancing Serb troops.
''They tell us about being ambushed by Bosnian Serb soldiers. . .
wearing blue helmets, UN uniforms, using a bull horn to tell them to get
out of the woods and come out in the open and then lining them up on the
road and shooting them,'' Janowski said.
There have been persistent reports of atrocities committed against
refugees from Srebrenica, a UN ''safe area'' in eastern Bosnia which
Bosnian Serb forces captured last week.
As many as 15,000 soldiers and civilians may have fled on foot and
many are still missing.
Janowski said the reports gathered by staff for the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had heightened concern for the safety
of the 17,000 refugees who are expected to be evacuated from the ''safe
area'' of Zepa.
Janowski distributed a two-page summary of accounts received from
refugees who made the trip from Potocari to government-held Kladanj by
bus:
* ''A 60-year old man and his wife say that in their bus four young
women were taken out into the woods. An hour later only three of the
women returned to the bus. The fourth woman showed up in Kladanj naked
with only a blanket wrapped around her.''
* ''Dead Bosnian men in civilian and military clothes were seen
scattered along the route to Kladanj. Groups of hundreds of captured
Bosnian soldiers, their hands behind the back of their head, were all
along the route.''
Four soldiers interviewed by the UNHCR said they were among a column
of 15,000 people, including 6000 woman and children, who struck out
through Serb territory after Srebrenica fell.
They were reported to have walked through 45 miles of forests and
faced heavy shelling, land mines, and ambushes. The soldiers said
hundreds were killed and hundreds more were captured.
One soldier told UNHCR staff the first Serb ambush killed 60 people at
Jaglici the day after the column left Srebrenica.
He said Serb soldiers with UN uniforms and vehicles reportedly were
operating in the vicinity of Konjevic Polje, where they lured about 20
to 30 Bosnians, mostly women and children, out of the woods, lined them
up on the road, and shot them.

<HEADLINE>Critics condemn lottery for opera's #55m high note</HEADLINE>

THE Royal Opera House yesterday was handed the largest award from the
National Lottery grant, a #55m windfall. It then immediately ran into a
row over backing for ''elitist'' arts.
The Arts Council announced a total of #62,384,462 had been awarded to
41 organisations nationwide but chairman Lord Gowrie denied it was
supporting entertainment for ''rich toffs''.
He said: ''I do not accept the premise under which the criticism is
made but I respect the anxieties which underlie it. I am sensitive to
and understand the criticism.
''I do not like the crudity of the words rich and poor.
''Opera audiences I have seen are very often quite struggling
middle-class professional people and not rich toffs.''
He added: ''I had hoped to announce a #65m grant with the extra #10m
for lower ticket prices.''
Mr Jeremy Isaacs, general director of the Royal Opera House, welcomed
the grant and said: ''I think Britain should have a great international
opera house.''
The English National Opera received only #1.3m but said: ''We are
delighted for them.''
However, spokeswoman for the Cancer Research Campaign, Ms Susan
Osborne, described it as ''an obscene amount of money to give to one
organisation. This leaves causes like us out in the cold.''
Labour MP Tony Banks said: ''It really is amazing to see the way
middle-class people are so quick and willing to look after essentially
their own pet project, before looking around to see where the money is
being raised in the lottery, and perhaps looking at more local
projects.''
The Covent Garden Community Association condemned the payout, saying
distributors of lottery money should not give grants to organisations
with which they were involved. The Arts Council, which distributes the
lottery cash, is involved with the ROH.
''Such action lays it open to legal challenge,'' the association
added.
The ROH had applied for #78m to go towards a #213m refit for the grade
1 listed Victorian opera house in Covent Garden, and Lord Gowrie said it
may get more to match this original bid.
He said the balance of #23.5m would be subject to receipt of
satisfactory proposals but he was confident they would be forthcoming
and a further grant would be awarded.
Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley said: ''The Royal Opera House
presents opera and ballet to the highest standards. The building itself
is a valuable part of our built heritage.
''The Arts Council's decision to give this grant to the Royal Opera
House will unlock a big partnership contribution from private donors.''
Lord Gowrie said the public had to accept that the arts in this
country generated a huge contribution to the economy and in addition
large amounts of lottery money had been spent on sport as well.
Other much smaller grants were made to arts organisations all over the
country but Lord Gowrie was adamant the Royal Opera House deserved its
lion's share.
* Dunoon is to bid for lottery funding to create its own ''Gateway to
the Highlands'' -- twin 1000ft-high steel towers.
The aim of the futuristic project by Cowal businessmen is to give this
part of Argyll a major Scottish tourist attraction, according to
enterprise trust officials.
The idea is the creation of local designer Robert Gilmour, who also
runs a cinema in Dunoon. He has presented his project to members of the
Cowal Millennium Steering Group which is now considering various schemes
to mark the year 2000.
The centrepiece of the structure will be two vertical towers which
will dominate the East Bay area of the town and be visible for miles.

<HEADLINE>Fighting flares around besieged enclave as commander's deadline for surrender passes.  The final flight begins at Zepa</HEADLINE>

FIGHTING flared around Zepa last night after a Serb deadline expired
for the Bosnian enclave to surrender.
Bosnian Serbs began shelling the town as the deadline passed and
Bosnian Government troops then apparently opened fire on a Ukrainian
peacekeepers' base north of the town with machine guns and mortars.
''Upon the expiry of the deadline the Bosnian Serb army resumed heavy
weapons fire into Zepa town,'' said UN spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Gary
Coward.
''The Bosnian army then began firing machine guns and heavy weapons
into the area of the Ukrainian compound, whether in response to the Serb
attack we do not know.'' He said there was some damage at the Ukrainian
base but no casualties. The Serb bombardment later stopped.
Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko Mladic announced on Wednesday
that Zepa had surrendered but the town's defenders refused throughout
yesterday to accept his terms for the evacuation of civilians, which
involved the Serbs keeping most of the men as prisoners of war.
The United Nations said the town was still in Bosnian Government
hands.
Bosnian Serb troops surround the Zepa enclave, a so-called UN ''safe
area'' where 17,000 Muslims are huddled in fear of being overrun.
Mladic had set the deadline for talks on the surrender of Zepa and
evacuation of women, children, elderly and the wounded.
UN sources said both the hardline general and 60 buses to be used to
ship out the Muslims were kept waiting all day as Government forces
pondered the surrender terms.
The sticking point in the talks may have been Mladic's demands that
all males between 18 and 55 years of age had to surrender to the Bosnian
Serbs as prisoners of war.
International relief agencies report that some Muslim males who
surrendered under similar terms when the neighbouring safe area of
Srebrenica fell to Serbs last week were executed.
The Bosnian Serbs have said they will transport women, children,
elderly and wounded to Government lines.
Colonel Coward said the Bosnian government had asked for a meeting
mediated by a senior UN officer to negotiate a settlement.
Observers speculated that the government side was trying to buy time
for most of the area's males to escape into surrounding mountains to try
to reach government territory.
UN officials were on their way to Zepa last night to see what was
happening.
Zepa's mayor issued an impassioned plea for international assistance
through a local amateur radio operator last night.
''Zepa is still in the hands of its people -- free, but never in a
worse moment,'' he said over the crackling airwaves.
''Completely surrounded, attacked from all sides and exhausted. This
is a last appeal to the world media. Help us. Help these suffering
people. Do not let the Srebrenica tragedy happen again.''
The Serb plan to remove Zepa's 17,000 Muslims follows the capture of
the nearby ''safe area'' of Srebrenica last week and the mass exodus of
over 30,000 Muslim refugees.
The UN called it a ''callous policy of ethnic cleansing which is an
affront to the values of all civilised people''.
As the United Nations yesterday called for heavy air strikes against
the Serbs if they keep up their attacks on the UN ''safe areas'',
observers reported a large new assault by Croatian Serbs on the Bihac
enclave.
Up to 1200 Muslim refugees were said to be fleeing the town of
Sturlic.
UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali matched the American call
for military strikes with a plea for more diplomatic efforts to end the
war.
But soon after a Serb shell slammed into the Bosnian presidency in
Sarajevo as EU peace envoy Carl Bildt was inside negotiating with
President Alija Izetbegovic.
A second shell landed nearby. No-one was hurt.
Bildt shrugged off the danger: ''I've been to Sarajevo before. Shells
are always falling. This is a city where this happens.
''I don't think there is any particular significance or drama because
I'm here. Shells fall every day. My concern is with policy issues, what
we can do (to end the war).''
Bildt described his two-hour meeting with Izetbegovic as ''wide
ranging and soul-searching''.
Meanwhile, rebel Croatian Serbs punching into the Bosnian Muslim
enclave of Bihac appear to have seized the gateway community of Sturlic
and up to 1200 inhabitants have fled.
Krajina Serb tanks and artillery were pummelling the north-central
portion of Bihac, a Government enclave in north-west Bosnia, after
backing an infantry assault over the mountainous border from Serb-held
Croatia.
The Krajina Serbs are ethnic allies of Bosnian Serbs.
Bihac town, at the south end of the enclave of the same name, is also
a UN haven but has not been targeted in the assault by Krajina Serbs,
who hold 20% of Croatia.
But analysts believe the attack may be the harbinger of a pincer
offensive on the entire enclave, joined by Bosnian Serbs from the east
once they have mopped up in eastern Bosnia.
Colonel Jasper Helsoe of the small UN Protection Force contingent in
Bihac enclave said Krajina Serb tanks, artillery and 1000 or more
infantry had advanced up to two miles along a front three miles long.
The Krajina Serbs carved a bridgehead, apparently absorbing the large
village of Sturlic on the road entering the enclave from the north-west
in rebel-controlled Croatia.
Some 800 to 1200 refugees from Sturlic reportedly streamed into
Coralici and Cazin in the heart of the enclave.

HARD-PRESSED Scottish Customs officers last night were ruing the day
they missed uncovering a #60m cache of illegal drugs from South America
because of a shortage of manpower.
As a full team of officers was preparing to search the 13,593-tonne
Polish vessel Krakow II, which had been tied up for more than three days
in Invergordon, Easter Ross, some of the officers were called away to
search another suspicious vessel which had docked at Ullapool. As a
result, neither search was as comprehensive as normal and nothing was
found on either ship.
However, the Customs officers at Invergordon were unhappy that they
had been unable to mount a full search and relayed their suspicions to
their opposite numbers in Norway.
As the vessel reached Stavanger, Norwegian officers swung into action
and uncovered 20 tonnes of cannabis -- one of the biggest cannabis
seizures in Europe this year.
Last night, union officials and MPs demanded an investigation into the
circumstances which had led to Scottish Customs staff missing the boat.
The National Union of Civil and Public Servants already is fighting
the Government over drastic cutback plans which will see 542
anti-smuggling staff made redundant in Britain, with the most severe
cutbacks in more remote parts of the country.
Seven Scottish Customs and Excise offices in Scotland are due to be
closed, with a further eight earmarked for closure. Over the next four
years, Scotland's force of 1650 is to fall by between 350 and 400.
At the NUCPS headquarters in London, union official Frank McLaughlin
said: ''We are particularly concerned that if the imminent cuts go
through, these kinds of incidents will become more commonplace.''
Last night, SNP leader Alex Salmond said: ''This kind of case
vindicates the stance we have taken on these Customs cutbacks. I am
demanding a probe because I fear that the kind of nonsense proposed by
the Government for reducing the Customs cover in Scotland will
dangerously increase the evil trade of international drugs supply
here.''
Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat MP for Ross, Cromarty, and Skye,
also demanded an immediate inquiry. He said: ''This incident confirms
our worst fears about the Customs cuts.
''If any good comes of this dramatic development then it must be that
Government Ministers start heeding the warnings which have been forcibly
expressed by MPs and senior police officers.
''Our Customs presence must be upped and there has to be an urgent
review to ensure that this scale of illegal material is detected and
seized within Scottish shores in future. I am raising all this directly
and urgently with the Paymaster General and the Secretary of State for
Scotland.''
Mr Kennedy yesterday received a letter from the Paymaster General, Mr
David Heathcoat-Amory, which assured him that ''there is no question of
Customs in Scotland being left with insufficient anti-smuggling
resources.''
The MP described the letter as ''badly timed and indeed a classic
howler''.
Mr Lindsay Freck, 39, senior Customs officer at the Invergordon office
which is earmarked for closure, said: ''Normally we would have completed
the search here but, in the circumstances, we decided on an alternative
course of action. We are pleased to have been part of a big, successful
international drug-busting operation. We understand the street value of
the drugs seized is around #60m.''
He said they had told the Norwegians about their suspicions and asked
them to give the Krakow II a thorough search when she docked after
sailing from the Cromarty Firth on July 12.
Norwegian Customs found the cannabis the day after she berthed in
Stavanger. It was concealed in 3ft high sealed plastic drums containing
chemicals, which were in turn hidden in two 40ft-long metal containers.
A spokeswoman for Stavanger police said yesterday: ''We can confirm
that 20 tonnes of cannabis were seized from the Krakow II in harbour
here. No-one has yet been arrested but our investigations are
continuing.''
The vessel, owned by the Polish Oceanic Line, of Gdynia, had sailed
from South America with a cargo of fish meal and called at Rotterdam,
Holland, before berthing at Scotland's deep-water east coast port. Her
load went to a factory in Invergordon which makes feed pellets for
salmon farmers.

THE United Nations human rights committee has called on the Government
to explain why its report to delegates has ignored support for
self-determination in Scotland, but includes backing for a referendum
for the people of Northern Ireland.
Following an initiative by the Scottish Council for Civil Liberties,
delegates from Germany, Australia, Egypt, and Chile have asked Britain
to provide ''clear and precise'' answers as to why it has not accorded
the same rights to Scottish people as it has to people in Northern
Ireland.
A member of the British delegation will today be called upon to give
oral evidence relating to its written report, which was prepared last
year.
The chairman of the SCCL, Mr Alan Miller, said: ''It is very
significant as it is the first time that I am aware of in a human rights
context that the question of Scotland's right to self-determination has
been received by the UN. The UN has considered it appropriate to ask the
UK why it is not according Scotland the same rights as another part of
its territory -- Northern Ireland.''
The UN human rights committee is currently holding hearings on the
application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(ICCPR), which Britain signed in 1976. Britain is obliged to report
periodically on how much it has done to implement civil and political
rights.
Britain's written report to the ICCPR, its fourth, which was published
last October, prompted the SCCL to write a counter-report, protesting
that the Government's version ignored civil and political rights in
Scotland.
The director of the SCCL, Ms Carole Ewart, said: ''In relation to the
Scottish jurisdiction, the Government has failed to comment sufficiently
or give adequate information to allow a proper evaluation of its respect
for the ICCPR in Scotland.
''This lack of information is startling given that we have a distinct
legal system, a separate education system, a different local government
structure, and a strong cultural identity.''
Ms Ewart said she feared the SCCL's points would be ignored because
the UK had never included a Scottish Office member in its delegation.
However, this year, Mrs Gillian Stewart, under-secretary in the criminal
justice department, is representing Scottish Office interests in the
delegation.
A spokeswoman for the Scottish Office said: ''Attempts to compare the
constitutional position in Scotland with Northern Ireland trivialise the
depths of the problems which have prevailed in the province for
generations.
''Government proposals for Northern Ireland seek to reconcile the
interests of a deeply divided community flowing from the existence of
conflicting traditions. There is no comparable situation in Scotland.''
The UN human rights committee will also challenge Britain today as to
why there it has no Bill of Rights giving people in Britain a domestic
remedy if there is a breach of their fundamental human rights.
The SCCL report is concerned about alleged attacks on trade union
rights, restrictions on political freedoms, infringements of privacy,
and the need to reform the criminal justice system.
Dr Allan Macartney, the deputy leader and foreign affairs spokesman of
the Scottish National Party, said: ''The SCCL is to be congratulated for
this initiative. There is a massive anomaly in the Government
facilitating the principle of self-determination in the province of
Northern Ireland with a referendum pledge, while frustrating it for the
nation of Scotland.
''The Government are now obliged to defend the indefensible in front
of the international community. They should take the opportunity to
announce a constitutional referendum for Scotland.''
A spokesman for the Scottish Liberal Democrats said: ''It is clearly
right that the Scottish people should have the right to determine their
own political future and that should be a constitutional feature. Only
the Conservative Party denies this. We believe that there should be a
referendum giving Scotland the choice and it will be interesting to hear
what the Government says at this committee in response to these
questions.''

SIR Richard Greenbury -- the man who led the inquiry into ''fat cats''
pay -- yesterday dramatically told Chancellor Kenneth Clarke to drop tax
changes on share options.
He admitted the committee he chaired ''did not think through'' a
recommendation which resulted in thousands of modestly paid workers
facing increased taxes.
As the Greenbury committee made public its findings on Monday, the
Chancellor swooped in a ''dawn raid'' on Monday to replace capital gains
tax on share options with income tax.
However, Sir Richard made the extraordinary claim that Mr Clarke acted
before he had even seen a copy of the report.
The move was greeted with a chorus of criticism as it emerged that it
would hit employees of small companies who received small payments from
share option far harder than top-ranking executives.
Sir Richard yesterday admitted the recommendation for a tax change was
pushed through against his will and told MPs on the Commons Employment
Select Committee it was a mistake.
''Immediately we had reviewed the position and I had brought to my
attention . . . the effect we were going to have on thousands of
modestly paid people in smaller plcs, I spoke to two tax experts, and I
today have written to the Chancellor saying that that was not the
intention of the committee and I hope he will re-examine it,'' he said.
''As I know him to be a reasonable man, I hope and believe he will do
so. If he chooses not to, I can't do any more. I am not in the business
of legislation.''
Labour's Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said: ''All Kenneth Clarke's
tax decisions are based on chaos and confusion.
''He seems to have made a major tax change even before he had been
given a copy of the Greenbury report.''
Sir Richard said it was no secret that he had ''considerable
reservations'' about his committee's recommendations but was in a
minority of two.
He called on the Inland Revenue to use the old system on gains of
between #8000 and #10,000 a year.
Sir Richard, the #800,000-a-year chairman of Marks and Spencer, left
no doubt about the pressure he has faced personally as chairman of a
committee originally set up by the Confederation of British Industry.
His personal life had been affected ''to an unbelievable degree'' by
the press attention and members of his close family had been harassed.
''I have been subjected to a personal campaign against my salary as a
fat cat,'' he said.
Asked if his committee would continue its work, he exploded: ''I have
not been asked to do so -- and if I was, I can tell you after the last
six months I would have to say no. I've had enough.
''I don't like being in a crossfire between politicians, in a
crossfire between industrialists, in a crossfire between shareholders,
in a crossfire between the members of the press.
''What's been in it for us except an enormous amount of hard work and
a great deal of slagging off?''
The Treasury said Mr Clarke would take note of Sir Richard's comments
and reply to him in due course.
However, officials said there were no plans for him to reverse his
decision.
They pointed out that Mr Clarke made it clear on Wednesday in an
interview on BBC Television that if firms were concerned about lower
paid employees being hit by levying income tax on share options they
could get round it by using other schemes such as profit-related pay and
save as you earn.
Asda, which wrote to Mr Clarke earlier this week to protest about the
measure, welcomed Sir Richard's comments.
A company spokesman said: ''We are pleased that Greenbury has spoken
up about this issue. We will be campaigning to get the Chancellor to
change his mind.''
Mr Clarke's decision to end the tax loophole without providing
safeguards for employees also caused widespread anger at Wednesday's
meeting of the CBI's ruling council.
All other aspects of the Greenbury committee's report were welcomed
but the CBI's taxation committee has been asked to discuss the issue
with a view to present possible remedies to the Government.
CBI president Sir Bryan Nicholson said last night: ''Clearly a lot of
CBI members share the same concern as Sir Richard.
''We have been bowled a fast ball and we are trying to short circuit
our consultation process to satisfy members' concerns.''
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director-general of the Institute of Directors,
described the Chancellor's decision as a ''bit of a knee-jerk
reaction''.
Speaking on BBC Radio's The Financial World Tonight, Mr Melville-Ross,
who also sat on the Greenbury committee, said Mr Clarke had
''misinterpreted'' the committee's recommendations.
He said: ''To announce on the same day the report was published that
tax concessions were to be removed was going a bit far.''
He said the committee had called for tax changes but not on schemes
available to employees generally, while small unlisted companies should
have been immune to change.
The committee's proposals were complicated, Mr Melville-Ross said, and
urged the Chancellor to reconsider his proposals before the Finance Bill
became law.
However, former Cabinet Minister Tim Yeo told BBC Radio's PM programme
that Sir Richard had acted ''unprofessionally'' in going back on his
committee's recommendation to tax executive share options.
Mr Yeo, a member of the all-party Employment Select Committee, said:
''Now, there has been a bit of an outcry about that because the
Government acted on it, instead of saying he welcomed the Chancellor's
prompt response to his report he has apparently abandoned his position
of only three days ago. I find that extraordinary.''
In a letter to Sir Richard last night, the Chancellor said: ''I was
surprised to receive your letter of today's date. You had given a great
deal of careful thought to your report with the help of tax experts.
''You kindly gave me advance notice of it. I considered it and agreed
with it. You have now apparantly changed your mind.
''You agree that executive share options should be given income tax
treatment. That is what I have done. Your concern seems to be with those
employees whose company has chosen to use executive share options to
reward the more junior staff. One has to ask why have they chosen to do
so.
''Is it really to provide rewards linked to performance or is it to
take advantage of a tax break? I do not believe that the tax system
should determine the choice of remuneration. Good corporate practice
should do that.''
''If a company does not want to provide options for all its employees
it can use approved SAYE option schemes or a profit-sharing scheme.''
Last night, a group of Tory back benchers also launched a campaign
against the new rules.
Mr David Shaw (Dover) has tabled a Commons motion backed by five other
MPs asking for the tax changes to be scrapped.

AN American-style priority response system to life-threatening
emergencies would provide the model for a faster and more effective
Scottish Ambulance Service, it was claimed yesterday.
A report due out within the next two months will provide the way
forward for the service on the basis of a Criteria Based Despatch (CBD)
system to quicken response times to genuine emergencies, even in the
most rural areas.
The promise of a high-tech and faster service came from the chief
executive of the Scottish Ambulance Service as a Government inquiry into
the English system found that thousands of lives could be saved every
year if emergency calls for an ambulance are given priority according to
their urgency.
According to an interim report drawn up by an independent working
party for the Department of Health, two or three minutes can mean the
difference between life and death for heart- attack victims.
The study, the findings of which were released yesterday, claims
around 3000 lives a year in England could be saved if nine in 10
patients with life-threatening conditions were seen within eight minutes
of a call being made.
At present, ambulances on both sides of the border respond to all
calls without any attempt to separate life-threatening cases from less
urgent ones.
Under the new plans, a controller would separate urgent calls after
seeking advice from paramedics -- a system which operates in many parts
of the US.
Ambulances would go first to heart-attack patients and those whose
lives were at stake.
Guidelines for current ambulance response times state that95% of all
cases should be seen within 14 minutes in urban areas and 19 minutes in
rural areas. Half of all cases should be seen within eight minutes of
the call being taken.
Conditions seen as immediately life-threatening would include adults
with chest pain and difficulty breathing, anyone unconscious or having a
fit.
Others include people with severe breathing problems, unable to speak
whole sentences; people with head or body injuries; or people in severe
shock with breathing problems.
Around 15% of all 999 calls are estimated to fall in this category.
Other conditions which may be life threatening but which did not
depend on treatment within minutes, would be treated as emergencies
under the current system. These might include gastro-intestinal bleeding
or a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.
Mr Andrew Freemantle, the chief executive of the Scottish Ambulance
Service, welcomed the recommendations of the English study and said many
of them would be replicated in a parallel Scottish report due out within
the next two months.
However, due to the geographical complexity of the country, the same
level of response times would vary between the central belt and the
Highlands and Islands.
''I agree that an eight-minute response time may not be applicable to
certain parts of say Grampian and Highland region but a criteria- based
discipline could certainly work in urban areas,'' he said.

SCOTLAND'S first children's hospice yesterday received a delivery
worth #100,000.
The Post Office donated #50,000 to the Children's Hospice Association
Scotland to transform a derelict cottage at the Clackmannanshire hospice
site into an information centre and fund-raising shop.
To add to the gift, Royal Mail staff are giving up their evenings and
weekends to carry out the refurbishment work free of charge, saving CHAS
#50,000 in labour costs. The hospice is currently under construction at
Kinross.
The information centre, to be run by volunteers, will explain about
the children's hospice, known as Rachel's House, and will contain a shop
to raise cash.
Mr John Rea, CHAS's director of fund raising, said they have raised
nearly #9m, ''but we are still short of our #10m target and therafter
require #1m every year to run Rachel House. We need the support of
Scottish business and the public as much now as before.''

A TREE-cutter was carried for more than one mile dangling from a
helicopter after becoming entangled in ropes while harvesting Christmas
trees, Fort William Sheriff Court heard yesterday.
Mr Allan Thomson, 29, of Fort William, who suffers from vertigo, was
stiff with shock after his experience in Ardnamurchan last December.
Helicopter pilot Ian Durston, 49, from Cawdor, pled guilty to
negligently causing or permitting his aircraft to endanger Mr Thomson
and was fined #500 by Sheriff David Noble.
Sheriff Noble said it was imperative that a foolproof system of
communication be established between aircraft and ground personnel
during tree-felling operations.
The court heard that Durston was employed by Dollar Air Services, of
Uxbridge, to transport trees off the hillside to waiting lorries.
Procurator-fiscal Ms Agnes Neizer said Durston had been responsible
for ensuring tree cutters were aware of hand signals to indicate when
trees was ready to be uplifted. Radios had also been issued.
However, a solicitor for Durston admitted his client had received no
signal indicating it was safe to take off. He had ''exercised his own
judgment'', unaware Mr Thomson had been caught in the trees.

AN initiative calling for urgent action to redress inequalities
between men and women is launched today by organisations representing
nearly eight million women throughout the UK.
The National Agenda for Action calls for equality in all areas of life
concerning social, political, economic, and health issues by way of
simplified laws to prevent discrimination, equal access to education and
training, action to encourage family responsibilites, and additional
measures to improve women's participation in decision-making.
It is being launched by the UK's two statutory equality bodies, the
Equal Opportunities Commissions for Great Britain (the EOC) and for
Northern Ireland (the EOCNI) and the Women's National Commission which
is responsible for representing women's views to government.
Publication of the agenda has been timed to coincide with the run-up
to the Fourth UN World Conference on Women in Beijing and is designed to
ensure that commitments made by the British Government on equality
issues at the UN conference are put into action here. It will also be
used to influence government policy and the General Election manifestos
of all the political parties.

GRAMPIAN Television has been snubbed by the network over plans to
broadcast a prestigous historical documentary, narrated by Sean Connery,
in a prime weekend viewing slot.
Though the Scottish station's executives were putting a brave face on
it yesterday, it is understood they are angry over the London Network
Centre's last- minute decision to relegate Highlanders, a bold and
ambitious programme marking the 250th anniversary of the start of the
Jacobite Uprising, to a late-night showing. Instead, England will watch
a repeat of a Jimmy Tarbuck show.
The decision is particularly galling for Grampian because it had
originally intended for the one-hour documentary to be broadcast on
Sunday, July 23, 250 years to the day Bonnie Prince Charlie landed on
Eriskay. The network, however, persuaded them to accept July 30 as a
more acceptable date, promising the programme would be broadcast
nationwide at the key 10pm slot on a Sunday evening.
Then, only days before the publicity launch for Highlanders, the
network centre informed Grampian that the show would be put back to
11.15pm, a move which could cost millions of viewers. Only Scottish,
Border, and Grampian itself have had the gumption to stick with the
original 10pm timing.
Ironically, the weekend scheduling of the documentary brings it within
the sphere of London Weekend Television -- a company whose managing
director, chief executive, and director of programmes are all Scots.
However, to be fair to LWT, it has little or no influence over the
network centre's decisions.
Highlanders is an important documentary which has as much of a
significance to British history as it does to Scottish. In addition to
Connery's incisive narration, which he helped to write, it is visually
stunning and expensively produced.
A London Network Centre spokesman dismissed the matter as ''a simple
scheduling decision'' and declined to make further comment. However,
from a Scottish perspective, it would appear to be far from simple.
Highlanders has become a casualty of the ratings war. Viewing figures
are supremely important to ITV and, unfortunately, a repeat of a Jimmy
Tarbuck show is regarded as a better bet in England than a new Scottish
documentary.
The network's decision was criticised strongly by Mr Paul Scott, the
Scottish National Party's spokesman on arts and broadcasting. He said:
''This is, of course, typical of the attitude of the media tycoons in
London who think that something Scottish will not interest those in
England. It is the kind of decision which is being made too often in
London and it is quite wrong.''

THE Queen Mother, who will be 95 next month, left hospital yesterday
looking fit and well after an operation to remove a cataract from her
left eye.
She went into London's King Edward VII Hospital on Wednesday for the
operation, which was performed that evening and was described by doctors
as ''routine''.
Wearing a green floral outfit and matching hat, the Queen Mother
walked to a waiting Daimler as she left hospital for the short journey
from Marylebone to Clarence House, her London home.
The Queen Mother's sight has been deteriorating for some time but it
is not clear whether her other eye will also need cataract surgery. Last
Christmas, the Duke of York took the precaution of sticking white tape
on the front edge of stairs at Sandringham so that they could be more
easily seen by his grandmother.
Public attention has centred more on the Queen Mother's injured right
leg, which makes walking difficult. The leg, which is believed to be
ulcerated after an injury last summer in Scotland, is now kept heavily
bandaged. The Queen Mother often relies on a walking stick and is
reported to have resorted recently on occasions to a wheelchair.
Yesterday, she looked remarkably well, although her left eye appeared
to be slightly swollen. A hospital spokeswoman said: ''She is in very
good health. It was a very satisfactory operation.''
The Queen Mother is expected to make a full recovery, hosting her
usual birthday family lunch party on August 4

A #5m DEAL which will secure golfing times for debentured business
clients at St Andrews has been condemned as ''the thin end of a wedge''
that will deprive ordinary players of the chance of playing golf on
Scotland's most famous course.
The St Andrews Links Trust, the organisation which administers the
club's six courses, is facing widespread opposition over a 10-year
contract worth #5m with the London-based hospitality company, the Keith
Prowse Agency, to sell starting times on the championship course.
It is a deal which it claims will secure the financial future of golf
facilities at St Andrews into the next century.
The times purchased -- amounting to approximately 7% of the starting
times on the famous links course -- will all be taken from existing
visitor times.
Yesterday, key figures in golf and tourism concerns, who may be
affected by the contract, expressed their anger.
The Scottish Incoming Golf Tour Operators -- SIGTO -- is to hold an
emergency meeting in St Andrews this weekend and has written to the
trust seeking more details.
The body, which comprises nine leading Scottish golf tour operators,
has also lobbied the Royal and Ancient Golf Club. The R&amp;A is also to
hold discussions into its implications.
Local golf clubs, with 3000 members both at home and abroad, have also
expressed concern about the long-term effect of the deal.
Mr Denis McDonald, the secretary of the St Andrews Golf Heritage
Society, claimed the deal was akin to Keith Prowse running the course.
''The course doesn't need to be booked five years ahead,'' he said.
''Something will have to give, and as the local golfers pay least to use
the course, I fear it will be them.''
Mr Jim Hastie, a member of St Andrews golf club, also fears that local
tee-off times -- currently restricted to one hour every morning on the
Old Course -- could be cut.
''This is the thin end of the wedge,'' he claimed. ''The Links Trust
is handing golf at the Old Course into the hands of big business
interests . . . and there is nothing we can do to stop them.''
The managing director of the Old Course Hotel, Mr Jonathan Thornton,
said he had been ''taken by surprise'' by the deal and was treating it
as ''an extremely serious issue''.

AN investigation into a Paisley community business caught up in
allegations of drug dealing and money laundering was ordered by the
Scottish Office yesterday.
Housing Minister Raymond Robertson announced an independent audit into
the use of Urban Aid Programme funds by Ferguslie Park Community
Holdings Ltd. It follows controversy over the running of a subsidiary
company, FCB Enterprise Security Ltd.
Mr Robertson's decision was outlined in a letter to the Paisley North
MP, Mrs Irene Adams. It is also understood that Mrs Adams met Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth on Wednesday night to discuss the issue.
In a statement, Mr Robertson said: ''Mrs Adams made serious
allegations. In view of this, I have announced an independent
investigation.'' The exact terms of reference of the inquiry, or who
will carry it out, have not been made public. FCB Enterprise Security
Ltd is currently being investigated by Strathclyde Police and a working
party of Renfrew district councillors.
Mrs Adams welcomed the decision yesterday and said she had responded
to allegations over the misuse of public funds at FCB voiced by
constituents.
''I raised this after a meeting with police when they named a number
of people involved in the drugs war. For the past few months, people in
my constituency had raised concerns about the security company. When I
discussed the drugs problem in Paisley with the police, the names they
gave me were the same names. The police said they were investigating the
company but could not get an audit on the books.''
Mrs Adams tabled 14 parliamentary questions in April, demanding
answers on FCB's operation. She also called on the then Scottish
Secretary, Mr Ian Lang, to answer questions about the supervision of the
company, its holding company, and its external auditors. The requests
were refused on the grounds, said Mrs Adams, that responsibility for
monitoring Urban Aid lay with the local authorities.
''Clearly this is a complete U-turn by the Scottish Office,'' she
said. ''When I first laid these questions in April, they said it was not
the responsibility of the Scottish Office. I then asked whose
responsibility it had been for the past 20 years.
''I am happy that the Secretary of State has accepted responsibility
for this and hope he puts the results of all these inquiries together.''
The allegations have been denied strenously by FCB Security Ltd, the
largest employer in Ferguslie Park. It was set up with #195,000 of
public money as part of a #47m project to revitalise Ferguslie Park.
Ferguslie Park Community Holdings is one of Scotland's oldest community
businesses.
Two local councillors, directors of both companies, welcomed the
investigation, saying it would clear the air.
Local Strathclyde regional councillor Harry Revie, chairman of the
holding company, said: ''I'm absoloutely delighted at the news. In fact,
I would go further and say I welcome it enthusiastically. It will put to
an end once and for all any rumours and innuendo. It is high time that
this was all brought to a conclusion.''
Councillor Olga Clayton, of Renfrew District Council, said: ''I said
at the outset that if the company was involved in something illegal, as
a director of the company I wouldn't wish to be involved. I would want
it to be resolved so the company can get on with its work which is
employing people in Ferguslie Park who can't get work.''
Both councillors, as is normal practice across Scotland, were
automatically appointed to the board of the local companies by the
district council.

KILLER Ian Kay began a life sentence at Broadmoor last night as the
parents of his final victim asked why prison officials had given home
leave to the self-confessed psychopath.
He was already in jail for a chillingly similar attack on a teenage
shop assistant when he was allowed out of jail last year and went on a
violent robbery spree, targeting Woolworth's stores.
It ended within weeks with trainee manager John Penfold, 21, dead
after Kay -- described by one senior police officer as ''calculating,
devious and cunning'' -- stabbed him during a confrontation in a
Woolworth's store in Teddington, south-west London.
An Old Bailey jury took just over an hour yesterday to reject defence
claims that Kay's personality disorder made him guilty only of
manslaughter, not murder.
Jailing him for life, Recorder of London Judge Lawrence Verney told
Kay, 28: ''You are an extremely dangerous man . . . who showed an
utterly ruthless approach.
''We now hear that there has been similar conduct in the past and the
risk for the future remains indefinite.''
Mr Penfold's father, Michael, a Sainsbury's store manager, said
outside the court: ''We are relieved that Kay has been convicted of
murder, but his sentence will not bring back our son.''
There was fierce criticism of the way Kay had been given home leave
despite his convictions and the fact that he had carried out a robbery
during a previous home leave a few months earlier.
The mother of one of his previous victims summed up the bewilderment
at the way he was given home leave from Maidstone Prison in Kent.
Jenni Boston, whose son Richard lost six pints of blood and at one
point ''died'' before being resuscitated, said: ''Thanks to the quick
actions of the public and the skill and expertise of the medical
profession, I still have my son.
''Mr and Mrs Penfold need never have lost theirs.''
Detective Superintendent Chris Burke, who led the hunt for Kay,
described home leave as a ''an environmentally unfriendly scam'' which
simply ''recycles nasty criminals''.
''After nearly 27 years as a police officer, it is one of the saddest
cases I have come across.
''Surely we must learn from this that people of Kay's ilk must not be
allowed to go on (home) leave. Somebody has to review that situation.''
It also emerged last night that another violent criminal had been
charged with murder after walking out of Maidstone Prison on home leave
only days after Kay.
Like Kay, the 33-year-old man, who was jailed for attempted murder
after stabbing his girlfriend 12 times, was given the leave despite
absconding before.
The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been charged with
murdering the wife he met while on the run from jail two years earlier.
It was only after French-born Kay killed Mr Penfold last November that
Home Secretary Michael Howard moved to tighten up the home leave system.
Two days after Kay's arrest, the Prison Service announced that a
stricter system was being introduced.
But many police officers believe the Government should have moved much
sooner to clamp down on a system which had led to numerous cases of
prisoners stealing, raping, and even killing while on leave from jail.
To Kay's twisted mind, both Mr Penfold and 17-year-old Richard Boston
were have-a-go heroes ''stupid enough'' to try to stop him, ''who got
what they deserved''.
Kay was jailed for a total of eight years in 1991 for the attack on
the youth in a newsagents in Kew, west London, and a string of other
robberies.
Just over two years later, in January 1994, he was granted home leave
from Maidstone Prison and within two hours had robbed a post office at
knife-point.
Kay, who smiled yesterday when he heard the jury's verdict, had
attempted to convince them he was not responsible for his actions.
He claimed he was half devil, half angel, that he heard voices,
fantasised about torture and killing -- and that he followed the occult
and read violent cult literature.
Kay told police that Mr Penfold ''lunged at me to stop me taking the
money from the till. I stabbed him in the chest. I knew the blade had
gone right in up to the handle''.

SCOTLAND'S daily prison population, which reached a record total of
nearly 5900 last November, could rise beyond 6000 in the next three
years, according to estimates in the corporate plan of the Scottish
Prison Service, published today.
The plan says that the average daily prisoner population in 1994-95
was 5630, which continued the upward trend through the 1990s.
Projections are given that the daily population in 1995-96 will be 5750,
in 1996-97 it will be 5900, and in 1997-98 it will rise to 6100.
The plan says that use of private finance is being considered for the
design, construction, management and financing of a new prison for 500
prisoners. A business case is being prepared for approval by the
Scottish Secretary, and work is in progress to identify a suitable site.
Among intended initiatives, the service says Castle Huntly in Tayside,
an open establishment for young offenders, has been under-used and there
will a change of use to house short-category D adults.
At Cornton Vale, spare capacity will be used for category D male young
offenders, in areas separated from the female blocks.
A 60-place houseblock is being built at Greenock Prison for occupation
by the end this year.

THE Bosnian Serbs will be sent a clear message from London tonight:
attack Gorazde, and face massive UN retaliation.
One US official said Defence Ministers meeting last night agreed ''in
principle'' that this time they should not be deterred by any further
taking of UN hostages. This would not stop attacks by Nato warplanes.
US Defence Secretary William Perry said: ''You cannot allow your
policies to be taken hostage with your hostages.''
The White House said last night President Clinton, in telephone calls,
had won British and French support for a plan to unleash US-led air
strikes, and frantic diplomatic efforts were being made on the final
details for a unanimous announcement from the emergency London
conference.
Britain, France, and America are concerting the action which will
bring into play for the first time the full air power at the command of
the UN forces. Gorazde, a town of 65,000 and a garrison of 300 UN
troops, including 200 Britons, is to be defended.
The cumbersome UN procedural process is to be sidelined. UN commanders
on the ground will be able to call in instant action against the Serbs.
The London conference will also declare that similar action will apply
if the Serbs continue to block humanitarian relief to the Sarajevo.
The will to act hardened last night as Serbs put the pressure on
Muslims to evacuate the ''safe haven'' of Zepa, shelled the town, and
the UN Ukrainian compound came under fire from the Bosnian army.
The Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, plus their
military men, expect no difficulty from Russia or any of the other 12
nations attending the conference on the new determined strategy agreed
with the Americans and French.
French sources indicated that a new security line could be drawn
around Gorazde and the Serbs will be told they would be attacked from
the air if they crossed it. British troops with the Rapid Reaction Force
may take part in an operation to secure the supply route over Mount
Igman into Sarajevo.
Mr Major also had a 40-minute talk with UN Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, where it was agreed on the more powerful role for the UN
commanders.
Earlier, Mr Major chaired a meeting of his overseas and defence policy
Cabinet Committee which thrashed out the details of the British position
and its military implications. This was followed immediately by a full
Cabinet which endorsed the decisions taken.
The details of the proposed military action remain secret. When Mr
Rifkind winds up the conference today, he will make public only the
nature of the strategy and the new political determination of all the
nations involved to tell the Serbs: ''Thus far and no farther.''
Reinforcement of the Gorazde garrison of 200 Royal Welch Fusiliers and
100 Ukrainians appears to have been ruled out. The Americans are
unwilling to provide the necessary air transport to deliver a force of
around 3000 troops to the beleaguered ''safe haven''. They do not want
to endanger their helicopters and pilots unless the UN agrees to an air
strike against all the SAM missile sites throughout Serbia.
Massive air strikes against Serbian positions are therefore to be
endorsed.
The hope is the Serbs this time will take the Unprofor seriously. If
they do not, the plan is to destroy all the heavy weaponry that is so
far denied to the Bosnian Muslims by the UN arms embargo. This could
leave the Serbs facing an attack by the 5000-strong Bosnian force around
Gorazde on more equal terms.
A determined statement from the London conference may also forestall
efforts in the US Congress to declare unilaterally a lifting of the arms
embargo on Bosnia.
The EU peace negotiator, Mr Carl Bildt, is expected to leave London
immediately for Belgrade to emphasise that this time Unprofor is not
bluffing.
Today's conference will be attended by all the foreign ministers,
defence ministers, and military chiefs-of-staff of the nations that are
providing troops for the UN force in former Yugoslavia. Also attending
are UN and Nato officials.
There was some relief in Downing Street from intelligence reports
indicating there was no sign yet of Serb forces preparing to take
Gorazde. Military experts estimate they would need about 10,000 men to
overrun it because of the presence in the area of the 5000
battle-hardened Bosnian army troops.
Labour leader Tony Blair said he is standing ''four square'' with Mr
Major in his attempts to arrange concerted action.
