CANNES OPEN
COLIN Montgomerie, the seventh best golfer in the world, did something
which a 28-handicap hacker would have been embarrassed about in the Air
France Cannes Open yesterday. He putted into a lake.
The 31-year-old Scot came to the 563-yard final hole at Royal Mougins
four under par, and after two great shots was left with a 60-foot eagle
chance.
If it had gone in, Montgomerie would have finished the opening round
of the #300,000 event just one stroke behind France's Jean Van de Velde
and Swede Mathias Gronberg. Instead, the ball picked up speed going down
two big tiers in the green and sped past the hole into the waiting water
20 feet further on.
Europe's leading money-winner for the last two seasons walked off with
a bogey 6 and a three-under-par 68. ''I've never done that before and I
hope I never will again,'' reflected Montgomerie, who even managed to
smile. ''These things happen. No they don't -- what am I saying?''
He had been five under with three to play, but hit his tee shot into a
hazard at the 419-yard sixteenth and dropped a shot there as well.
''Twice in the water in three holes. Once with a driver, once with a
putter. Apart from that I'm playing great.''
Defending champion and tournament favourite Ian Woosnam avoided the
eight lakes, streams, and waterfalls on the new course and came in with
a five-birdie 67.
The Welshman, making his first European Tour appearance of the season,
continued with the left-hand-below-right putting method used by Nick
Faldo, but said: ''I've not decided whether I like it yet -- it feels
uncomfortable.''
Best rounds of the day were the seven-under-par 64s of Van de Velde
and Gronberg.
Van de Velde's score included a penalty drop after going into the
water at the long fourth. The 28-year-old saved par with a 30-foot putt
there, reached the turn in a three-under 32, and then had four more
birdies coming home.
In February, Van de Velde went on a skiing holiday to Colorado, but
before he even made the slopes fell down some stairs wearing his ski
boots, snapped ligaments in a knee, and could not resume his golf career
until the middle of last month. The course-record round equalled his
lowest on the European Tour.
Gronberg was out in 30, had further birdies on the fifteenth and
sixteenth, and from virtually the same spot as Montgomerie at the last,
he three-putted for a par 5.
The pair finished one in front of Swiss player Andre Bossert, who
birdied seven of the last 11 holes, and two in front of a group which
includes Scot Andrew Coltart, runner-up to Philip Walton in the Catalan
Open on Monday, and Swede Ove Sellberg, one of two players to have a
hole-in-one.
Sellberg's came with a No.6 iron to the 196-yard eighth. The ball
kicked off a bank into the cup. South African Ian Palmer used a No.9
iron at the 137-yard tenth in his 68.
Irishman Walton managed only a 74. Leading scores (British or Irish
unless stated):
64 -- J Van de Velde (France), M Gronberg (Sweden).
65 -- A Bossert (Switzerland).
66 -- D Hospital (Spain), O Sellberg (Sweden), J Bland (S Africa), A
Coltart, M Besanceney (France).
67 -- J Lomas, R Boxall, I Woosnam, J Robson, A Binaghi (Italy), N
Fasth (Sweden), O Rojahn (Norway), M Roberts, E Darcy.
68 -- R Chapman, I Palmer (S Africa), A Hunter, S McAllister, E Giraud
(France), D Robertson, P Moloney (Australia), C Montgomerie, P-U
Johansson (Sweden), M Harwood (Australia), J Haeggman (Sweden).
Other scores included: 70 -- D Gilford, S Torrance, R Drummond, M
Miller. 71 -- G Orr. 74 -- A Oldcorn. 75 -- C Cassells. 80 -- G Brand
Jr.

<HEADLINE>Era ends as Hastings makes last appearance at Murrayfield Farewell to the rock of Scottish rugby</HEADLINE>

THE Scotland rugby captain Gavin Hastings has ended all the
speculation over the timing of his retirement with an announcement that
he is to go after the World Cup in South Africa this summer.
Tomorrow against Romania at Murrayfield, Hastings, 33, will make his
fifth-seventh appearance in Scottish colours and it also will be his
last appearance on home territory.
He has captained Scotland 15 times, is his nation's top international
points scorer with 544 to date, is Scotland's most capped player, and,
with 56 this season, holds the record for the largest number of points
scored in a Five Nations' series.
Hastings also has captained the British Lions, Cambridge University,
and London Scottish. He has participated in two Lions' tours -- in 1989
to Australia, where the Test series was won, and to New Zealand in 1993,
when the tourists lost the series 2-1.
A sports marketing executive with Carnegie International, he will
continue to play for Watsonians, but after the summer will not
participate in top-grade representative rugby.
He succeeded David Sole as Scotland captain in 1992 and came through a
baptism of fire as the Scottish side suffered a series of nine games
without a win. Last season's wooden spoon was followed by a miraculous
about-turn as the Hastings-led Scots fought their way to a Grand Slam
showdown against England last month.
Likely contenders for his full-back berth next season are Kenny Logan
of Stirling County, who would switch from the wing, Rowen Shepherd of
Edinburgh Academicals, or Mike Dods of Gala. As for the captaincy, Rob
Wainwright, the West Hartlepool flanker, is generally reckoned to be
made of the right stuff.
The entire Scottish high command will have a new look next term. Team
manager Duncan Paterson and coach Dougie Morgan have also indicated that
the World Cup will represent their swan-song at the sharp end of the
Scottish game.
At a civic reception for the Scotland World Cup squad last night,
Hastings and brother Scott were presented with Edinburgh crystal
decanters and glasses by the City of Edinburgh in recognition of both
having topped the 50-cap mark.
Hastings' international debut was, like so much that was to follow, a
heady mixture from the pages of Boys' Own paper and cartoon capers.
With his first touch of the ball, against France at Murrayfield in
1986, Hastings rifled the kick-off straight into touch. The French took
the Scots by surprise and, instead of opting for a scrummage at the
centre spot, took a quick throw-in from touch and Pierre Berbezier ran
in for one of the fastest, and softest, tries on international record.
Hastings observed: ''I thought, oh dear, the forwards are not going to
be very pleased with me. Then I saw about seven Frenchmen running
towards me, and I thought, the backs aren't going to be terribly
chuffed, either!''
By the end, though, Hastings had redressed the balance in spectacular
fashion, with six successful penalty kicks that handed Scotland an 18-17
win.
A star had been born, and in the nine years which were to follow
Hastings would, time and again, defy what passes for rugby convention
with a series of performances which read like a Roy of the Rovers
storyline.
Scotland coach Morgan, during a break yesterday from preparation for
the game against Romania, was effusive in his praise. ''Gavin has been
the rock of Scottish rugby for 10 seasons now. He is a huge figure both
on and off the field and a gentleman of the game. People wrote him off
before the start of this season's Five Nations' Championship, but he
came back with an impressive display of character and skill that enabled
him to contribute even more points to Scotland's cause. His efforts and
productivity for Scottish rugby have been quite phenomenal.''
Hastings has rewritten the Scottish record books but Ian McGeechan,
Scotland's 1990 Grand Slam coach, and coach to the Hastings-led 1993
British Lions, maintains that the player would be remembered for his
all-round rugby ability.
McGeechan, who also coached the 1989 Lions to victory in Australia --
a campaign on which Hastings was instrumentally involved -- observed, a
propos the 1993 sojourn to New Zealand: ''Gavin is widely respected and
admired in New Zealand. The All Blacks' respect has to be earned by
deeds on the pitch and they do not praise opposition players lightly.''
England manager Jack Rowell, whose side wrecked Hastings' dream of
Grand Slam glory last month, confined himself to the simple statement:
''Gavin is a real man in a man's game.''
Now, as widely expected, Hastings will bow out at the World Cup. For
the past nine years he has strutted his stuff on the world stage, a
Cavalier among Roundheads. It will be his third World Cup tournament
and, for one of the few genuine superstars that the world game has to
offer, there could have been no better arena in which to bid the
international game a cheery farewell.

RISING newsprint costs may force News International to call an end to
the newspaper price war, according to Mirror Group chief executive David
Montgomery.
He said that the rising price caused by shortage would cost Rupert
Murdoch's organisation about #60m in a full year whereas the supplies
for Mirror Group are more secure.
Pre-tax profits rose by 43.5% to #189m last year although the figure
is graced by a net #105m of exceptional items largely relating to the
clawback of #111m pension provisions made necessary after the Maxwell
fraud.
The underlying improvement was some 15% to #84.7m with turnover
effectively little changed at #463m after allowing for the extra week in
1993.
Year-on-year circulations improved for three of the five titles
although the Daily Record has fallen quite substantially from its summer
peak, by around 50,000 to 748,000, with a net gain on the year of just
7000 daily copies.
During the year, the then 28%-owned Newspaper Publishing, publishers
of the Independent, ran up losses of almost #42m. Mirror took a direct
hit of #4.9m as a trading item -- the Independent and Independent on
Sunday lost #12.5m in the second six months -- while there was an
additional exceptional charge of #6.8m to Mirror arising from the
reorganisation of the associate including the cost of moving to Canary
Wharf. Mirror and Tony Reilly's Independent Newpapers, based in Dublin,
each now own 43%.
Mr Montgomery said yesterday that he expects breakeven this year,
helped in part by an increase in the cover price. That is expected by
analysts to be in the autumn although Mr Montgomery said that there are
purchasers happy to pay an economic price for The Independent in the
near future.
He added that he will not allow Rupert Murdoch and News International
to set the agenda -- The Times has ''demeaned itself by charging 20p and
attracting the wrong sort of reader''.
The question of Mirror having board representation at Scottish
Television is ''not an issue''. The 20% holding costs #50.7m and is
currently showing a book loss of #7.4m with STV now at 444p compared
with the 520p purchase price last autumn. The board position will not be
decided upon until Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell makes clear the
Government's attitude on cross-media holdings probably late next month.
The two companies may team up for Live TV for cable networking in
Scotland with the Daily Record staff providing local news input.
Former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie is heading the Mirror investment in
programme supply to the cable companies and expects breakeven in three
years with some five million subscriptions by the year 2000.
Group operating margins improved from 24.3% to 25.1% compared with the
13.3% achieved at News International, 13.4% at the Daily Mail group,
10.2% at United Newspapers and 7.9% at The Telegraph.
Staff numbers fell 22% to 2785.
Mirror shares slid 5p to 135p despite the increase in the dividend
total to 3.5p with a 2.5p final for a 3.2% yield.

Ross Finlay witnesses circuit training for 4x4s
MUDDY tracks, to demonstrate their rough-country abilities, as well as
main and minor roads to show what they are like in everyday conditions,
are normal locations on the launch exercises of 4x4 vehicles. Putting
one on a racing circuit is, you might think, the kind of thing which
would happen only in Ireland, and it did. Vauxhall introduced the latest
uprated Fronteras on the Ards peninsula in County Down, and a local
rallycross ace was brought along to hurl one, with journalists in
passenger role, round the circuit at Kirkistown.
Both Vauxhall 4x4s -- the Frontera and the Monterey -- are essentially
Isuzu designs. The Frontera is built at Luton by IBC Vehicles, a
joint-venture company created by General Motors and Isuzu. To underline
the connection, GM is a substantial shareholder in Isuzu. Vauxhall
provides the petrol engines, Isuzu the diesels. Production at IBC
stuttered a while ago because of a door-sealing fault, but is back to
normal.
From the outside, you see only minor alterations to the
short-wheelbase Sport and the longer, five-door Estate. A less clumsy
rear-door spare wheel mounting is obvious on closer examination. But
there are substantial improvements to the mechanical specification, with
a new engine line-up, revised suspension and brakes.
At the same time, as the 4x4 market is holding up better than some of
us had been expecting, Vauxhall has trimmed Frontera prices. The
two-litre petrol-engined Sport now costs from #14,295, a new 2.2-litre
petrol Estate comes at #18,075, and there are three turbo diesels from
#16,245 to #19,325.
While interior trim has been perked up a little, the cabins of both
models remain very much the same, complete with antique switchgear. Some
4x4s are pretty cramped for passenger space in the rear, but it is still
curious that the short-wheelbase Sport seems to offer more room there
than the Estate, although rear passengers in the Sport sit very high,
and the smaller version has less in the way of luggage volume.
On ordinary roads the longer-travel front suspension, new coil-sprung
rear axle and gas-filled shock absorbers all seemed to contribute to
enhanced ride quality and responsive handling. Within the limits of 4x4
design generally, the Frontera has always appealed to me as one of the
most pleasant vehicles of its type on main-road runs. It seems to sit
more four-square on the road, especially in Sport form where the track
is reassuringly wide, and the overall stance of the car is less like a
galleon in full sail than some of its rivals.
Vauxhall now fits disc brakes all round instead of the original
disc/drum system. I think a 4x4 ought to have anti-lock brakes, and the
Frontera offers them on all models as a #700 option.
Best of the engines now is the 113bhp 2.8-litre turbo diesel,
available in both the Sport and the Estate, whereas the earlier 2.3 unit
came only in the Estate. As well as stronger road performance -- in the
Estate the 0-60mph time has tumbled from 19 seconds to around 15.5 --
the 2.8 offers far better low and mid-range pull, and would be the
choice of customers who do a fair amount of towing.
A mild if muddy estate-ground course showed that the Frontera, while
by no means the most businesslike of off-roaders, cuts its way through
the glaur. The usual high and low-ratio transfer box is fitted.
Two-wheel drive is normal on the road, 4WD off it. Free-wheeling hubs
are standard, but the kind of hub locks you have to get out and set
manually are an extra-cost option. There is no centre locking diff.
And at Kirkistown? Well, despite some sniffy comments from one of my
purist race-driving colleagues about rallycross man John Haffey's
cornering lines, his demonstration proved that the petrol-engined
Frontera Sport is a quick, lively and controllable performer in a
situation very few owners will ever experience.

LAWYERS paid tribute yesterday to retired Ayr Sheriff Douglas Grant,
who died in a road accident on Wednesday night.
Sheriff Grant, 78, died when the Vauxhall Astra in which he was a
passenger was involved in a collision as it turned into the private road
leading to his home at Drumellan House, a mile north of Maybole,
Ayrshire.
After the accident his wife, who was driving the car, was taken to Ayr
Hospital suffering from chest injuries, but was released yesterday.
Mr John Walker, 25, of Crossraguel View, Maybole, and 61-year-old Mr
Ernest Walker, the driver and passenger, in the other car, a Honda
Civic, were also taken to the hospital on Wednesday night but released
after treatment for minor bruising.
Mr Roy Penny, now vice Dean of the Ayr Faculty of Solicitors, said
yesterday of Sheriff Grant: ''He was a gentleman. It was always a
pleasure to appear before him you knew that he was caring about what he
did, and was applying his mind very carefully to it.
''He was someone you could put your case to, and at the end of the
day, whether he was for you or against you, you knew that he had done it
properly.''
Ayr solicitor Mr Peter Lockhart said: ''Sheriff Grant was a fine man
blessed with a great gift of understanding and compassion.''
Fellow Sheriff Neil Gow, QC, said that Sheriff Grant had occupied the
bench at Ayr for more than 20 years with a great sense of fairness. He
said: ''Over two decades he made an important contribution to the
maintenance of law and order in Ayrshire.''
Sheriff Grant was educated at Rugby and Cambridge and entered the
colonial service in Uganda in 1939. After war service he was called to
the English Bar in 1945 and served in the judicial and legal department
in Malaya from 1946 until 1957.
He was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates and the Scottish Bar in
1959 and was appointed Sheriff at Ayr in 1966.

FORMER Rangers and Liverpool manager Graeme Souness announced
yesterday that he will not go back into football management.
The man who was sacked by Liverpool last season will make his farewell
appearance as a team manager on May 1 at Ibrox when he will take command
of a Rangers International Select in the Testimonial Match for Scott
Nisbet.
The Rangers defender had his career cut short because of injury and
this game between the current Ibrox side and their former stars has been
arranged as a tribute to him.
Souness will look after a team which will include Terry Butcher, Chris
Woods, Graham Roberts, Terry Hurlock, Maurice Johnston, and Ray Wilkins
-- some of the men who helped set the Ibrox revolution in motion when
Souness was there as manager.
Now, though, it will be a swansong for Souness who, despite winning
the FA Cup for the Anfield team during his reign there, was eventually
sacked.
Yesterday, as it was announced that he would be in charge of the
International Select, he admitted: ''This will be a one-off for me. It
will be the first time I have been back at Ibrox, in this role since I
left the club.
''It is in a good cause, doing it all for Nissy who has had his career
end so early, and I'm happy to do it obviously. But, at the same time,
there is no likelihood of my going back into football as a manager. I
have not taken any great interest in the game this season and I don't
see that changing.
''I really don't have a lot of interest in the game any longer and
managing a club does not hold any particular appeal for me.''
Souness revolutionised Scottish soccer when he arrived as
player-manager at Ibrox in l986. He brought top English names to Ibrox,
some of whom he will be re-united with next month.
He set the Ibrox bandwagon in motion before suddenly walking out on
the club in l991 to go back to Anfield, where he had been club captain
in the days when Liverpool were conquering Europe.
But the move went tragically wrong for the man who had known almost
limitless success with Rangers. His time at Anfield was scarred with
controversy and, while he delivered the FA Cup -- the one trophy he had
not won as a player with the Merseyside club -- it was not enough.
He spent millions and could not deliver the championship -- and he was
axed even though he had suffered a heart by-pass operation.
Rumours have linked him with various clubs throughout this season but,
now, Souness has declared himself. His management career is over.
While it lasted it was mercurial and constantly controversial. But
while he may have been judged a failure at Liverpool there is no
doubting what he and his then assistant and now Ibrox manager, Walter
Smith, achieved with Rangers.
The pair of them transformed the Scottish game. If the Souness era had
not arrived then who is to say what kind of state the domestic game
would be in?
He had his critics, but anyone who examines his record and who can
look at the growth of Rangers since the time of his appointment must see
just how the aggressive, arrogant, prickly man from Edinburgh laid the
foundations for what has happened out Govan way.
The Ibrox legions will, no doubt, let him know that as he makes this
nostalgic farewell from the game.
In the meantime, Scotland have problems with the squad for the game in
San Marino next week. As well as Paul McStay's injury, Motherwell
defender Brian Martin has a calf injury which could keep him at home.
If that happens, then his Fir Park team-mate Rob McKinnon could be
called in. Manager Craig Brown will check both players when the team
gets together on Saturday.
In the Under-21 squad, Dundee United's David Hannah has been withdrawn
and Dundee striker Jim Hamilton has been called in.

HEARTS striker Kevin Thomas was determined last night that he would
return to action with the Tynecastle club within a year.
The Scotland under-21 internationalist had exploratory surgery on a
knee ligament injury yesterday, and the operation proper will follow in
a fortnight. Hearts manager Tommy McLean described the injury as
''career threatening,'' but also hinted at the player's determination.
Thomas took the original knock in last month's Scottish Cup
quarter-final tie against Dundee United, when he over-stretched his
knee.
After the pain had eased, he played again against Partick Thistle in
the league, but then snapped two parts of the cruciate ligament in the
Scottish Cup semi-final against Airdrie.
''I basically tried to play the ball away quickly in case I was
tackled,'' explained Thomas. ''But I tried to turn swiftly once and knew
right away that something was badly wrong and now at least we know the
damage.
''I'm determined to be positive and will be in at Tynecastle today to
do as much work as I can to build up the muscles around the knee.
''I've been told that it is the same injury as Ian Durrant had at
Rangers, but Ian had a cartilage problem in addition. The approach that
I will adopt is that I have a broken leg, but it will take longer to
heal.''
The 20-year-old striker is one of the brightest talents in the
Scottish game, having been introduced to the first team last season.
Under McLean, he has developed into a regular and has scored seven times
during what has been a difficult season for the Edinburgh club.
He'll be joined shortly under the surgeon's knife by midfield player
Scott Leitch, who is due to have a hernia operation.
But there was good news as well for Hearts yesterday, when they
announced the renewal of their shirt sponsorship deal with Strongbow --
worth #500,000 over two years.

LABOUR MP Tony Worthington has been re-appointed to the party's Front
Bench, little more than a year after being sacked for travelling abroad
without permission.
Mr Worthington, MP for Clydebank and Milngavie, is one of six MPs to
be promoted or moved by Labour leader Tony Blair yesterday in a
mini-reshuffle. He joins the Shadow Northern Ireland team headed by Dr
Marjorie Mowlam.
Mr Worthington, 53, hit the headlines when he was kidnapped by
Somalian gunmen in February 1994. Party whips claimed his visit to the
country had not been authorised, and he was dismissed from his post.
He disputes this, and his reinstatement is evidence that the Labour
leadership does not bear a grudge. Earlier this month, the Welsh Labour
MP Ann Clwyd was sacked from the Foreign Affairs team for visiting
Kurdistan without permission.
The other appointments are:
Foreign Affairs -- Mr Paul Murphy and Mr Tony Lloyd.
Environment -- Mr Eric Illsley.
Health -- Ms Tessa Jowell.
Whips' office -- Mr Bob Ainsworth.

Blackburn Rovers 2, Crystal Palace 1
KEVIN Gallacher's fairytale comeback goal cast away the clouds of
doubt which had hung over Ewood Park as Blackburn took another step
towards the Premiership title last night.
Jeff Kenna's first goal since his #1.5m move from Southampton began to
banish the nerves after Blackburn had struggled to find any openings in
the first half. And when Gallacher turned home from six yards soon
afterwards, everything looked simple for Kenny Dalglish's men.
But the Scottish striker's dream return after 14 months out since
breaking his leg against Arsenal last season almost turned into a
nightmare after he was carried off injured again following a dreadful
foul from John Humphrey.
When Ray Houghton pulled one back, all the fears returned, and Iain
Dowie was just the thickness of Tim Flowers' right-hand post from
silencing the home fans eight minutes from time.
As it is, Dalglish's men now need just five points from three matches
to claim the crown.
In the absence of the suspended Colin Hendry and Tim Sherwood,
Blackburn also had David Batty back after 12 months out.
Rovers had all the possession in the opening period, and in 23 minutes
Shearer looked to have put them ahead when he connected with meet Stuart
Ripley's only for Houghton to head off the line.
But all the nerves dissipated in 48 minutes. Ripley crossed from the
right, Sutton rose above two defenders, and Kenna was perfectly placed
to lash home.
Three minutes later Sutton poked the ball forward, Shearer's pace took
him to the dead-ball line, and when he pulled back Gallacher had the
simplest of tasks to convert.
But Dowie crossed from the left 19 minutes from time and the ball
rebounded for Houghton to ram home left-footed.
When Dowie's 22-yard drive came back off the post with Flowers beaten,
the anxiety rose until the joyous relief of the whistle.

Kilmarnock 0, Rangers 1
KILMARNOCK last night celebrated the opening of their new Chadwick
stand which now gives Rugby Park an all-seated capacity of 18,300.
Jimmy Knapp, General Secretary of the National Union of Rail,
Maritime, and Transport Workers presented the club chairman, Bob
Fleeting, with a cheque for #2m from the Football Trust. But the
champions, Rangers were in much less generous mood.
Those who thought Walter Smith's men would begin to relax after having
clinched their seventh successive title at the weekend, couldn't have
been more wrong.
Despite a strange line-up, the Ibrox side went out to entertain, as
did Kilmarnock, and with Laudrup strutting his stuff in flashes it was a
busy night for the home defence in which Whitworth and Anderson were
immense.
Rangers were again hit by a spate of injuries, so much so that only
four of last Sunday's starting line-up for the match against Hibs --
Cleland, Gough, McLaren, and Laudrup -- began last night.
And it was Laudrup as he has done so often this season who carved out
the only goal of the match before half-time. He made a strong run into
the box and unselfishly passed to the unmarked Mikhailichenko to score
from a couple of yards.
It was thrilling stuff and just before half-time Maskrey almost
grabbed an equaliser with a low drive which flashed past Maxwell but
bounced off the foot of a post.
It wasn't surprising that the pace dropped somewhat in the second-half
and when Kilmarnock still hadn't broken through after 75 minutes Brown
replaced Maskray.
Two minutes later, Rangers made a change with Robertson coming on for
Ferguson, and shortly afterwards the best chance of the half fell to
Durrant who lofted the ball over from close range. The player almost
made up for that in the final minute when he thumped a shot off the bar
with the keeper beaten.
Credit to Kilmarnock who never gave up the fight but when they did get
near the Rangers penalty area they found Gough and McLaren quite
unshakable at the heart of the defence.
Kilmarnock had three men booked as they tried for the points which
would have ensured premier division safety -- Whitworth, Anderson, and
Connor.
KILMARNOCK -- Lekovic, MacPherson, Black, Skilling, Whitworth,
Anderson, Mitchell, Findlay, Wright, Connor, Maskrey. Substitutes --
Reilly, Brown, Geddes.
RANGERS -- Maxwell, Moore, Bollan, Gough, McLaren, Murray, Cleland,
Ferguson, Durrant, Mikhailichenko, Laudrup. Substitutes -- Reid,
Robertson, Inglis.
Referee -- H Williamson (Renfrew).

ALLY McCoist and Gordon Durie were shut out when they turned up to see
their Rangers colleagues play at Rugby Park -- and ended up in the
Chadwick Stand among their own fans, writes Jim Reynolds. The official
explanation was that complimentary tickets had not been left for the
injured pair and they could not take their places in the main stand.
Instead, they bought tickets to join the Rangers fans behind one of the
goals and obliged at half-time by signing hundreds of autographs.

I AM amused by the nit-picking over the BBC's psephological
performance at the Scottish local elections. Indeed, I am reminded of a
story about the celebrated referee, Peter Craigmyle.
''That was never an expletive-deleted goal,'' protested an aggrieved
defender. ''Do you think not, son?'' said Craigmyle. ''Well read
tomorrow's papers.''
Apart from a few Nats, who may also believe that Scotland won the
Grand Slam and the Battle of Flodden, the rest of the country read the
next day's papers and reached fairly obvious conclusions, even without
the aid of the good Professor Curtice.
In my own new council area, North Ayrshire, the Nats lost the three
seats they had previously held on the same boundaries to Labour. This
was confirmed in the next day's papers, along with the results from West
Lothian (Labour gain), Glasgow (one Nat), and Edinburgh (no Nats at a',
man).
Whether or not the BBC's computer got it exactly right, in an exercise
confused by numbers of candidates and new council boundaries, is of
continuing concern only to political pedants with a vested interest in
presenting failure as success.
It is true that the SNP are big in Brechin and flying-high in
Fochabers. Equally, it is understandable that when the Tory vote slumps
to 11%, some of it has to find a temporary home which is least likely to
be Labour. But to carry on arguing that this represents a triumph or
reflects inexorable progress is tediously perverse.
The fundamental problem for the SNP is that the great majority of
Scots, including many who vote for them in local elections, do not share
their basic aim of a separate Scottish state. That is not Professor
Curtice's fault, nor the BBC's, nor even mine.
Scottish voters have had plenty of time to think about it, have
suffered the same aggressive barrage of advice to change their mind for
many years, have been called everything from fearties to Quislings --
and still come up with the same answer, which arguing about decimal
shares of the vote does not alter.
If a psephological debate is wanted, then it might more sensibly be
conducted round the detailed findings of the System Three poll taken for
The Herald last month in Perth and Kinross, scene of the forthcoming
by-election, where the SNP start as favourites to win because they came
second last time.
By far the most interesting set of responses in that survey was not to
the superficial question: ''How do you intend to vote?'' It was the one
about ''preferred options for governing Scotland''.
This showed that of the 1022 voters polled in Perth and Kinross, just
25% evinced support for ''a completely independent Scottish
parliament'', compared to the 48% who said they were going to vote SNP.
The break-down of the intending Nationalist vote becomes even more
curious. Less than half of it -- 46% -- wants independence. Virtually
the same number, 45%, want devolution as offered by Labour and the Lib
Dems, while 8% of Nationalist support comes from those who want ''no
change from the present system''!
Instead of arguing with the BBC, I would have thought that the more
serious problem facing a party whose whole raison d'etre is the creation
of ''a completely independent Scottish parliament'' is that more than
half of the people who say they will vote for the party do not agree
with that aim!
It is abundantly clear that the Nationalists go into the campaign with
a substantial lead because they are seen as the party best placed to
beat the Tories, which is what the great majority of any electorate
currently wants to do. That is not about the constitution; it's about
tactical voting.
System Three proves that any attempt to present Perth and Kinross as a
showdown on the constitution will simply be rubbish -- though this will
not stop the attempt being made and hyped, with votes cast for entirely
different reasons claimed subsequently as statements of constitutional
intent.
According to System Three, just 11% of the Perth and Kinross
electorate nominates the constitutional position of Scotland as one of
the ''main issues'' which will influence the way it votes. Even among
intending Nationalist voters, only 18% listed independence or the
constitution as one of their main concerns.
In contrast, 27% of the electorate put jobs -- or the lack of them --
at the top of their agenda, and 31% nominated the National Health
Service. The real question is whether these concerns can be ''poached''
by a plea for tactical voting, and then claimed retrospectively as votes
for a separate Scotland.
It is by no means certain that they can. The recruiting sergeant for
the SNP in Perth and Kinross is the claim that only they can beat the
Tories. Nobody now needs to believe that. The question is not whether
the Tories will lose, but who will beat them.
For all the inflated claims made about the local election results in
Perth and Kinross, the reality was that -- within the parliamentary
constituency -- the Labour vote went up 8% compared to the General
Election while the SNP vote went down by 3%. The trend is in the right
direction.
At the General Election, there was good reason to believe that ''only
the SNP could beat the Tories'' in Perth and Kinross. They failed. If
the 53% of intending Nationalist voters who don't want a separate
Scotland now feel liberated to vote accordingly, we could be in for an
interesting by-election.
Over to you, Professor Curtice!

DAVID Seaman pulled off a three penalty saves as Arsenal reached the
European Cup-winners' Cup final for a second successive season in
nerve-shredding fashion.
England No.1 Seaman worked the oracle for the second time in his
career on a damp but ultimately delirious night in Genoa. Three years
ago he also produced three saves in a penalty shoot-out in a Coca-Cola
Cup tie against Millwall at the old Den.
On this much more spectacular stage in Northern Italy, the big
Yorkshireman repeated his heroics to continue Arsenal's rampage through
Europe when they appeared to have thrown their ticket away.
Seaman, who played through two broken ribs in the quarter-finals
against Auxerre last month, dived to stop spot-kicks from Sinisa
Mihailovic, Vladimir Jugovic, and Attilio Lombardo.
Arsenal finished the 90 minutes on aggregate level terms only because
Swedish international Stefan Schwarz blasted home a 25-yard free-kick
just when all seemed lost.
Ian Wright had dragged Arsenal back into contention on the hour to
cancel out a lucky thirteenth-minute strike by Sampdoria's Roberto
Mancini, who scored when Arsenal were screaming for an off-side flag
against Lombardo.
Sampdoria substitute Claudio Bellucci had struck twice in 82 and 84
minutes.
Meanwhile, Chelsea failed against Real Zaragoza, but salvaged their
pride with a 3-1 victory on the night. A bizarre goal from Paul Furlong
and a second from Frank Sinclair repaired some of the first-leg damage.
In between, Santiago Aragon's away goal left the Londoners needing to
score five. Mark Stein got the third in 86 minutes.
Glenn Hoddle, the 37-year-old player-manager, sent himself on as
substitute. Afterwards he said he would hang up his boots at the end of
the season.

MAYBE it was an unkind comparison, but it was impossible not to draw
some conclusions when confronted with senior professional football
played in two countries on the same evening. After 90 minutes at
Hampden, where Celtic lost to Hearts on Wednesday night, it was very
difficult to believe that Ajax of Amsterdam played the same game, and
that was only in TV highlights of their 5-2 win over Bayern Munich.
The Dutch club's comprehensive drubbing of the Germans in their
semi-final of the Champions' Cup confirmed that all the rumours coming
out of Amsterdam for the past couple of years have been correct. Ajax
are building another team of the seventies, a side that might well match
the era of Cruyff, Neeskens, et al.
Perhaps even more important, they are fashioning a side in the total
football concept, where the old principle that if you score more than
the opposition, 5-3 is as good as 2-0, and a heck of a lot more
entertaining.
This is not to say that their coach, Louis van Gaal, is a disciple of
the naive approach. Far from it. He is said to be a stickler for
self-discipline on the field, but happens to be unearthing players of
such natural flair that it is well nigh impossible to get them to stick
to the game plan.
The prowess of the side, which included three teenagers in the squad,
two of them on from the start and the other as a substitute, has
fascinated and excited the population so much that there was even a
sizeable audience to watch them training this week.
Van Gaal took them to the seaside resort of Callansoog in the north of
the country, where the local schoolchildren, on Easter holidays, turned
out in great numbers to see their heroes.
What they saw was a typically innovative piece of van Gaal plotting.
He had decided that Bayern would make no serious attempt to attack
normally, that they would simply try to counter-attack when Ajax lost
the ball.
The training stint therefore comprised seven men, including a
goalkeeper on one side, and six attack-minded players without a goalie
on the other. The six had to keep the ball at all times, otherwise the
opponents would be able to loft the ball into the net almost at will.
Anybody who gave the ball away was substituted immediately.
The idea was to teach the forwards not to lose the ball but, like all
the best laid plans, this one went agley occasionally on the night. The
young Nigerians in the side, Finidi George and Kanu, are inclined to get
excited about their own skills and once they were in front and
apparently cruising, went into showboat mode, allowing the Germans to
entertain come-back notions.
However, the carelessness of exuberant, brilliant youth is something
even van Gaal has to live with.
They are now gearing up to face the magnficent tactical awareness of
AC Milan in the final. It promises to be a classic confrontation between
the old and new orders.
Some of the uninhibited football Ajax played against Bayern was not
only reminiscent of their seventies predecessors, but of the might Real
Madrid of the sixties.
Maybe that is why comparison with Hampden, where Real enjoyed their
finest hour, was specially unkind.

GRAND National winner Royal Athlete will definitely run in Saturday's
#60,000 Stakis Casinos Scottish Grand National at Ayr, it was confirmed
yesterday.
The 7-1 ante-post favourite will be ridden by his Aintree partner,
Jason Titley.
Royal Athlete will be attempting to emulate the feat of Red Rum in
1974 -- the last Grand National winner to achieve the Aintree-Ayr
double.
Assistant trainer Mark Pitman, confirming that Royal Athlete would
run, said: ''He has done everything we wanted him to do since the
National.''
Tartan Tyrant, who was 10-1 ante-post second favourite, is unlikely to
run unless there is considerable rain and the going becomes soft, said
his trainer Gordon Richards.
The Langholm-based Mackinnon Mills are unlikely to be represented as
their other entry, Tartan Tradewinds, has been withdrawn.
Ceilidh Boy, who was consided the best Scottish-trained propect in the
race, has bruised a foot during his preparations and will not take part,
his trainer Mrs Goodfellow said.
* RANGERS and Scotland striker Ally McCoist was part of a winning team
at Ayr yesterday when Sarmatian (11-2) was successful.
McCoist is a member of a syndicate of five headed by Stuart Brankin
who own the smart juvenile hurdler. He won first time out at Edinburgh
in December and came a close second over a mile on the Flat at Hamilton
Park two weeks ago.
Driven out by ''Stormin'' Norman Williamson, Sarmatian took the
Ruinart champion novices hurdle by three-quarters of a length from

* HAMILTON manager Iain Munro has been fined #200 and warned about his
future conduct by the SFA.
The general purposes committee were perturbed at his criticism after
the game against Stranraer in January and his view that the referee had
not taken strong enough action.
Rangers manager Walter Smith was censured for his critical comments
after the league match against Dundee United in February.
The then United manager Ivan Golac, who criticised Ibrox defender
David Robertson, was also censured and told that he must remember his
responsibilities if he returns to Scottish football.

PORTSMOUTH striker Gerry Creaney has been fined but has escaped the
sack after he was accused of putting himself at risk when he was beaten
up outside a night-club hours before a vital match.
Creaney, 25, Pompey's record signing, has been ruled out for the rest
of the season after having suffered a fractured cheekbone when he was
attacked while waiting for a taxi with former England winger Mark
Chamberlain.
The former Celtic striker, who has scored 22 goals this season, has
been fined a maximum two weeks' wages -- believed to be #2500.
Portsmouth manager Terry Fenwick was angry that Creaney breached a
club curfew banning players from entering licensed premises 48 hours
before a game when he went out to celebrate his twenty-fifth birthday
last week.
Creaney needed surgery to repair his fractured cheekbone and will have
to return to hospital for another operation.
Chamberlain's wife, Wendy, accused Fenwick of being ''insensitive''
following the assault on Creaney and her husband, who suffered minor
facial injuries. ''These two have been through enough without him going
on at Gerry. He has suffered a terrible ordeal and you would expect the
club to support him instead of giving him a hard time,'' she said.
Police are still hunting the thugs who attacked the players.

All three major divisions had contributed to what chief executive Jan

A DISAPPOINTING #1300m overshoot in the 1994-95 Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement is not expected to tie Chancellor Clarke's hands
if he decides to embark on tax cuts in his November Budget, though there
may be other constraints on his room for manoeuvre.
Last month the PSBR amounted to a hefty #10.4bn after privatisation
proceeds of #1850m, mainly from the sale of the Government's remaining
stake in National Power and PowerGen.
March is the month in which Government departments go on a spending
spree to use up their funding allocations. The outcome for the fiscal
year was a PSBR of #35.6bn, against a Budget forecast of #34.3bn. The
deficit was #45.4bn in the previous year.
The overshoot was small by normal margins of error in forecasting the
PSBR. The average discrepancy has been #4500m, according to the
Treasury, which shrugged off the greater-than-expected PSBR.
For much of the fiscal year the monthly PSBR figures had fed hopes of
an undershoot of about #2000m, but in the event both spending and tax
receipts were lower than the Treasury expected at the time of the
Budget.
Total central government receipts were #3000m short of the Budget
forecast and total central government outlays were #1200m below
expectations. Local authorities and public corporations both repaid
slightly more debt than expected.
Inland Revenue receipts were #1800m below forecast. Customs and Excise
receipts undershot by #900m and National Insurance contributions were
#300m lower. Net departmental outlays were about #1000m below the Budget
projection. A major factor in the discrepancies on both spending and
revenue was lower-than-expected inflation.
The Treasury's forecast for the PSBR in the current fiscal year is
#21.5bn, equal to 3% of gross domestic product, the target set out in
the Maastricht Treaty for monetary union.
James Capel's Adam Cole said the undershoot did little to change the
outlook for the public finances in the current year. ''Nor are the
mildly disappointing figures likely to do anything to silence the siren
voices on the Tory right demanding tax cuts in the November Budget.''
Cole's own view is that the Treasury projections -- particularly those
for corporation tax -- still look a little cautious. ''A PSBR undershoot
this year is more likely than an overshoot, further fuelling speculation
over tax reductions.''
Corporation tax is paid a year in arrears, and so booming 1994 company
profits will boost corporation tax receipts in the current year.
Clarke's scope for tax cuts in November will be dictated by
projections for the PSBR in 1996-97. The latest Treasury forecast
postulates a deficit of #13bn, equal to just 1.75% of GDP.
But the Chancellor has to be careful that he does not repeat Nigel
Lawson's error of cutting taxes when the economy was set to boom.
Another constraint could be slippage on public spending allocations as
it becomes increasingly difficult to hold the line on public sector pay.
However, he should be able to relax the tight fiscal squeeze of the
last two years, though the price might be a compensatory rise in
interest rates.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke

SECURITIES Trust of Scotland increased its payout for the first time
in three years to reassure its many private investors that the recent
restructuring of its UK portfolio was paying off. Tim Hall, who runs the
Martin Currie investment trust, admitted that it had perhaps been
overgenerous in its distribution at the start of the nineties.
Having held its total dividend at 3.25p for the years to end-March
1993 and 1994, the #300m Securities Trust yesterday announced a 3.7%
increase in total dividend to 3.37p, after a final payout of 2.29p.
In the year to end-March this year, net asset value fell 6.4% to
84.3p, compared with a fall of only 1.5% in the trust's benchmark
All-Share index.
Mr Hall attributed the underperformance to exposure to bonds and to
the Far East, which accounted for 6.9% of total holdings at the
year-end. Fixed interest investments, mainly UK gilts and debentures,
made up 13%.
Three years ago, the trust found itself with a substantial UK
convertibles position, which cushioned it during the recession but
offered only a static yield.
It had to switch into Ordinary shares and borrow money for fixed
interest investments, in order to achieve its objective of income
growth. The UK accounted for 75.8% of the total portfolio at the
year-end.
In the year to end-March, Securities Trust's gross revenues rose 2.6%
to #19.4m.
Having increased gearing from 13% to 18% towards the end of 1994, Mr
Hall believes the trust can now take advantage of a recovering gilt
market.
Securities Trust is currently focusing on a return to Japan, as well
as opportunities in India, Taiwan and Korea.

THREE of the best break-builders in the game had chances to compile a
maximum 147 at Sheffield yesterday, but the cheque for #147,000 on offer
remained unclaimed.
English teenager Ronnie O'Sullivan missed the tenth red in the third
frame of his match against Darren Morgan but world champion Stephen
Hendry and his opponent, Malta's Tony Drago, both went closer yesterday
afternoon in the second session of their match, which Hendry leads 11-5
when they resume this morning.
Drago had a chance to compile a 147 of his own during the second
session of his clash with Stephen Hendry.
In a quick-fire session, Hendry dropped only two of the eight frames
to extend his 5-3 overnight lead, and made breaks of 41, 54, 81, 99, and
80. In the eleventh frame, the four-times world champion took 11 reds
and 10 blacks but then covered the black with a red, and he finished on
81.
Just 20 minutes later, Drago sank 11 reds and 11 blacks but slumped on
the table when the twelfth red wobbled in the jaws of a top pocket.
''In my heart of hearts I knew I probably would not make the
maximum,'' said the Maltese star. ''The balls were all over the table
and it would have needed a miracle.''
O'Sullivan went on to share the opening eight frames against world
No.8 Morgan but the teenager totalled just 18 points in the last three
frames as Welshman Morgan pulled level from 1-4.
He also won the first four frames last night to take an 8-4 lead, but
then it was the turn of O'Sullivan to hit a run as reeled off four
frames in a row to level it at 8-8 before their final session this
afternoon.
The teenager produced three breaks of 50 or more in his fightback last
night but so far it is Morgan who leads in half-centuries by seven to
five.
Welsh veteran Terry Griffiths faces more overtime tonight after an
ominously slow start to yesterday's second-round encounter with former
World Matchplay champion Gary Wilkinson. They failed to complete their
allotted eight-frame session, and Wilkinson leads 5-2.
Peter Ebdon became the first player into the last eight after a 13-7
victory over Sussex stable-mate Mark Davis.
After having survived a first session in which he had not played well,
Ebdon began yesterday morning locked at 4-4 but he soon took charge
after a break of 79 to put him in front at 5-4 for the first time since
the first frame of the match.
Davis' only successes came in the eleventh and a low-scoring fifteenth
frame, before Ebdon clinched the next with runs of 41 and 30 to end the
session 10-6 ahead.
He won the first two frames last night to stand one away from victory,
which he duly sealed just before the scheduled interval.

GREATER GREENSBORO OPEN
FIJI'S Vijay Singh, aided by a long putter, returned to form to tie
for the lead after the opening round at the $1.5m Kmart Greater
Greensboro Open in North Carolina yesterday.
Using a 42-inch long putter, he carded a flawless seven-under-par 65
in ideal, calm conditions on the Forest Oaks course to tie the lead with
Americans Brad Faxon and Steve Lowery, one shot ahead of Masters
runner-up Davis Love.
Ulsterman David Feherty, the only British player in the field, shot a
three-under 69 after three successive birdies starting at his eleventh
hole.
Singh was so frustrated with his putting at the Masters, where he
missed the cut, that he put a longer shaft on his putter-head for last
week's Heritage Classic. He again missed the cut but was much happier
with his putting, and yesterday compiled five birdies and an eagle.
Leading scores (US players unless stated):
65 -- Vijay Singh (Fiji), Brad Faxon, Steve Lowery.
66 -- Davis Love.
67 -- David Edwards, Mike Heinen, Hal Sutton, Scott Simpson.
Europeans: 69 -- David Feherty (Northern Ireland). 70 -- Jesper
Parnevik (Sweden).

BIRMINGHAM'S Gavin Brettell was the only new name among the list of
winners at the European championship trials in Sheffield.
With a powerful surge over the final 10 metres, the 18-year-old, who
has yet to earn an English cap, won in 1min 03.93sec.
The other events went with form, and Paul Palmer and Marie Hardiman
made certain of a chance to improve on their silver and bronze medals at
the last European Championships with wins in the 200m free-style and
200m breast-stroke.
The Scots had to settle for appearances in finals -- although Kirsty
Hope and Paul Latimer had the satisfaction of personal bests.
But,in the junior events, Reading-based Scot, Ian Edmond, won the 100m
breast-stroke to make sure of retaining his place in the British side
for the European Junior Championships.
Hope, a former British youth cap, lowered her fastest time to 58.79sec
in the heats of the 100m free-style, and then went 58.47 to finish sixth
in an event won by Karen Pickering. Results:
Men: 200m free-style: 1, P Palmer (City of Lincoln) 1min 50.65sec; 2,
J Salter (City of Birmingham) 1-50.68; A Clayton (City of Leeds)

A WIND of change has been threatening to sweep through Scottish
women's hockey for a few years now without really gathering any great
velocity, but all that could change this weekend.
Normally at this time of the year, Western Klick Photopoint have
secured their place in the European Club championship and are looking
forward to the cup final with the pressure off.
Well, this year it's a different story. Defeats by the 'Young
Pretenders,' Edinburgh Ladies and Bonagrass Grove, have put the
championship aspirations on hold, while Sunday's cup final at Peffermill
against Grove is unlikely to be a picnic.
The key to Western's season may well hinge on tomorrow's confrontation
with Edinburgh Ladies in the national league at Millerston. Should they
fail to win, then the trophy could be beyond their reach for the first
time in 13 seasons.
In the event of this happening, then the cup final will for a change
become a meaningful contest with the prospect of Western being frozen
out of Europe for the first time since 1978.
0  However, Grove's inexperience may go against them, while Western
have trodden this route for the past seven years, taking the title in
the last six.

<HEADLINE>Chambers survey shows slowdown in UK recovery</HEADLINE>

THERE has been a significant slowdown in the rate of UK economic
activity both at home and abroad in the first quarter of 1995, according
to the latest quarterly survey from the British Chambers of Commerce,
raising a question mark over next month's anticipated rise in interest
rates.
Many economists expect interest rates to be lifted after the next
meeting between the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England
on May 5 because of worries expressed about the weakness of the pound
and its inflationary implications at an earlier get-together.
A rise is still thought likely but the CBI April Quarterly Industrial
Trends Survey to be released on Tuesday could be crucial if it follows
the BCC pattern.
The findings of the BCC survey, which also showed Scotland still
lagging the rest of the UK in both the manufacturing and services growth
league though improved on the preceding quarter, should dampen any
worries about overheating.
The BCC concludes that the domestic economy is quickly sensitive to
changes in monetary and fiscal conditions. Continued expansion in the
medium term looks assured, but at a less dramatic pace than in the
previous two years.
Introducing the survey, the BCC's president, Robin Geldard, spoke
against any hike in base rates. He said: ''There's nothing in these
figures which leads us to believe that a raising of interest rates for
inflationary reasons would be either necessary or wise and I would hope
very much that despite the currency markets' problems that the
Chancellor and Bank of England will not raise interest rates merely in
order to support the pound.''
On the domestic market the survey shows that although still exhibiting
solid levels, the rate of growth has slowed. There has been a
substantial decrease in the number of manufacturers reporting increasing
orders, while the number of service firms reporting growth in orders has
remained broadly steady for a year now.
As foreshadowed in the previous quarter the dampening effects of
successive interest rate rises, and the gradual introduction of
increases in taxation, are ensuring that the lid is being kept on
expansion in the domestic economy.
UK exporters in both the manufacturing and service sectors have been
unable to sustain the high levels of growth enjoyed in the previous
quarter. The balance of firms in both sectors enjoying growing levels of
export has fallen, although it does remain higher than six months ago,
and is within the overall upward trend seen since 1991.
Overall export growth levels therefore remain strong, and the export
sector continues to outperform the domestic market by a wide margin.
The survey also shows that both manufacturers and service sector firms
are now less convinced than they were that turnover will improve, and
manufacturers have again downgraded their expectations for improved
profitability.
In Scotland, the declining sales and orders in the service sector
recorded in the last quarter has been halted, with both indicators now
showing growth. Manufacturers' sales in both export and home markets are
growing, but at a lower rate than in previous quarters.
BCC said that in the Scottish home market the performance of both
sectors is the direct opposite of each other. An 11% balance of service
sector firms report growing sales in this quarter, represent quite a
change in form from the previous quarter when there was a negative
balance of 17% reporting declining sales.
In contrast, while manufacturers' home sales are continuing to grow,
the rate is down nine percentage points from a positive 12% in the
previous quarter to 3% this time. Notably, a balance of small firms
report further declines in orders, worsening from a negative 2% to 5%.
Scottish manufacturers' exports are at a lower balance than in the
previous quarter but prospects for future growth of sales look
optimistic with the balance of firms reporting increased orders, up from
a positve 15% to 29%.
So far as Scottish business confidence is concerned, this is well up
in terms of turnover and profits in the service sector, a marked
turnaround from the previous quarter, perhaps reflecting increased
growth in home sales.
In manufacturing, confidence in turnover remains growing at around the
same rate. However, in both sectors confidence is considerably lower
than in the rest of the UK.

THE inquiry into irregular betting patterns reported after Jimmy
White's first-round victory over Peter Francisco will reconvene in
Manchester next month.
The WPBSA, the game's governing body, had accepted in Sheffield on
Wednesday that White had no case to answer, but continued its inquiry in
respect of Francisco's part in his 10-2 defeat.
The three-man disciplinary panel, which is headed by WPBSA
vice-chairman Geoff Foulds, heard evidence from the two players as well
as from match referee Alan Chamberlain, and John Spencer, the WPBSA
chairman.
It was later revealed that Francisco's prize money of #8750 as a
first-round loser has been withheld pending the results of the WPBSA
probe.

EDINBURGH-based Miller Group returned to profit last year, helped by a
better performance in property development and housing, but continued to
be dogged by heavy losses in its civil engineering division.
Miller Group reported a #3.1m pre-tax profit on turnover of #359.6m
after an #11.9m loss on sales of #343.4m in 1993.
Chief executive Keith Miller said he expected an even better
peformance this year, but he predicted that the depressed civil
engineering business would remain in the doldrums.
''We are certainly looking for a substantial improvement on 1994,''
said Mr Miller, who took over as chief executive of the privately-owned
group in October last year.
He noted that the group made a loss of #12.7m last year on its #282.7m
contracting business, which includes civil engineering, and said it
would be difficult to turn a profit on civil engineering in 1995.
''The business is very competitive and margins are going to remain
tight,'' he added.
Miller Group's main profit centre last year was property development,
where sales totalled nearly #26m and all investment properties were
fully let.
Housing was another bright spot, with sales growing at nearly 17%,
almost twice the market average of 8%.
Mr Miller said the group was planning to use its year-end cash surplus
of #27.3m to fund a series of land purchases for housing and commercial
development in 1995.
The group would also invest in new plant, especially for its
profitable open-cast coal mining activities, he added.
The chief executive said the group had avoided land purchases for the
last 18 months due to high prices, but the market now looked more
favourable.
''Land is available at reasonable prices. We have identified a lot of
opportunities which we will be developing during the course of the
year,'' he said, identifying the main target areas for land purchases as
central Scotland, southern England and the Manchester area.
Mr Miller said the group aimed to increase its involvement in Private
Finance Initiative housing schemes, where a private developer builds
low-cost housing on land owned by local authorities in a
Government-sponsored initiative.
The group was also looking for more ''design-and-build'' commercial
contracts, where the builder is involved right from the design stage.
''That way we are much more in control of difficulties when they arise
on the job. It's much more a teamwork approach that we are adopting,''
he said.
The chief executive said the Miller Group would maintain its open-cast
coal mine production at around the 1994 level of 1.6 million tonnes this
year.
But he said the group, which has so far operated mines on contract to
private owners, would open two of its own coal mines in England this
year and these would eventually produce a further 200,000 tonnes of coal
per year.
Mr Miller expressed satisfaction with the group's involvement in the
construction of a controversial toll bridge that will link Skye to the
Scottish mainland and largely replace existing ferries.
Miller Group and the German construction and design firm Dywidag are
building the bridge, which is due to open this autumn, as a joint
venture. ''That project is going very well,'' he said.
The chief executive said Miller Group, which turns 61 this year, had
no immediate plans to seek a stock exchange quotation, but did not rule
out such a move completely.
''Obviously it is something that is an option at any time, but it's
not on the agenda at the moment,'' he said.
''What is more important to us is to build the business up and show a
strong profitable expansion. With the balance sheet the way ours is
there is no need to raise new money,'' he said referring to the group's
healthy cash balance and #70.6m of net assets at the end of 1994.

SCOTLAND, still disrupted by the absence of Sarah Gourlay, whose wrist
is still not strong enough to allow her to play, had another bad day at
the Atlantic Rim women's outdoor championships yesterday at Durban.

KEY batsman, handy medium pace bowler, and brilliant fieldsman Mark
Waugh is poised to add another string to his bow for Australia in the
third Test against West Indies which starts today in Port of Spain,
Trinidad.
At the urging of his captain, Waugh has been polishing his form as an
off-spinner with a view to providing back-up for leg-spinner Shane
Warne.
Waugh tweaked a few during the West Indies second innings as the
second Test faded to a draw, but his role at Queen's Park Oval promises
to be more than a mere novelty act.
An unusually green pitch virtually guaranteed Australia would take
three fast bowlers into the match and abandon any plan to include
off-spin specialist Tim May in the XI.
However, skipper Mark Taylor expected the well-grassed strip would
eventually offer more turn than the second Test pitch in Antigua and he
wanted Waugh to be on call.
West Indies are likley to retain their standard, four-pronged pace
attack.

* A 20% CUT in capacity is planned by the Dutch cattle slaughter
sector. Funds are available to abattoirs with an annual capacity of 3000
units or more.
Thirty plants which between them slaughter 1.1 million animals fall
into that category. Under the plan six guilders (equal to #2.22) will be
collected for each animal slaughtered. The money will be used to buy up
abattoirs which will then stop operation completely.
The owners will be barred from re-starting an abattoir business
throughout the European Union.

<HEADLINE>Bureaucracy difficult to handle. Problem of European aid</HEADLINE>

THE bureaucracy which often accompanies aid programmes from Europe
should be eradicated, Iain Robertson, chief executive of Highlands and
Islands Enterprise, told United Farmers at a dinner following their
annual general meeting in Edinburgh.
Mr Robertson said that European assistance, while very welcome, was
not without its problems. The accompanying bureaucracy was sometimes
difficult to handle. ''We have got to find ways to simplify European
programmes.
Other countries seem to be able to do it on a more simple basis and we
should be able to do that too, without the huge amount of form-filling
and double-guessing that seems to go on,'' he said.
European Objective One status, which will bring in funding of #240m to
the Highlands over a six-year period, should not be regarded as a source
of long-term support, Mr Robertson continued.
For the Highlands and Islands, Objective One status was double-edged
sword. ''It means we are recognised as one of the poorest areas in
Europe. Our aim should be to raise the Highlands and Islands so that we
do not qualify for Objective One assistance in five years time -- and
not to remain subsidy junkies for ever.''
Under the Highlands and Islands Agricultural Programme, one of the
Objective One initiatives, there would be an investment of #2.5m in
marketing schemes designed to boost sales of Scottish produce. He urged
farmers throughout Scotland to join quality assurance schemes so that
they could realise their full potential.
There was great concern from consumers and retailers regarding animal
welfare and the processing of animal products, he said. ''Such demands
are likely to increase. Quality programmes and marketing schemes are
vital to help inform customers about ways in which animals are looked
after and food is processed. These programmes can play a long-term role
-- but they must be supported by the industry.''
United Farmers -- a co-operative of farmers' co-ops -- reported a
successful year, with a 9% increase in turnover. Ian Weir, managing
director, said that the combined strength of co-operatives, operating
through UF could bring significant benefits. One large supplier of
fertilisers had recently indicated that UF members' presence had forced
them to reduce their selling prices by about #7 a tonne throughout the
whole Scottish area.
''Farmers need to recognise the power that their co-ops have when
working together,'' he said. ''It is important that they maintain a
significant countervailing force in the market, a market which could so
easily be dominated by the multi-nationals -- a position which would
certainly not be in the farmers' long-term interests.''

DENNIS Andries, the British cruiserweight champion from Hackney in
London and a boxer who claims to be nearing the 50 mark, although he
could be aged anything between 41 and 48, was in Glasgow yesterday to
appeal to the city's fight fans to help him achieve his dream.
Andries is certainly the oldest British champion since the
introduction of the Queensberry Rules, and in a career spanning 61
contests he has held the World Boxing Council light-heavyweight title
three times.
Now he is chasing a fourth world crown, and wants to win it in
Glasgow. ''I've had my last two fights in Scotland, and I now regard it
as my home turf,'' he said.
''I've fought all over the world, but I have never experienced
anything like the enthusiasm I have here. The Scottish fans respect me,
and I love them. I'm not a showman, I'm a fighter, and the people here
appreciate that. When I go for that fourth world title I want the
Scottish fans behind me. They will probably scare the daylights out of
my opponent.''
Promoter Frank Warren is confident he can tempt WBC cruiserweight
champion Anaclet Wamba, of France, to defend in Glasgow.
First, however, Andries defends his British title at the Kelvin Hall
on May 13. He meets Hackney rival Terry Dunstan in the chief supporting
bout to the Frank Bruno-Ray Anis fight.
Meantime, Katherine and Alex Morrison promote a show at the
Hospitality Inn tonight, with bantamweight Donnie Hood, of Glasgow,
continuing his comeback against Shaun Anderson, of Maybole.
Also at bantamweight, Scottish champion James Murray, of Newmains,
takes on the heavy-hitting Ady Benton, from Dewsbury. Benton lost in a
challenge for the British title against Condorrat's Drew Docherty at
Irvine last November and sees a victory tonight as his way back to
another challenge. Tonight's two bantam winners will meet on the
Bruno-Anis bill next month.
Lightweight Jim Montgomerie, younger brother of Kilmarnock defender
Ray, takes on Huddersfield's Chris Aston, while at light-welter Rocky
Ferrari, from Glasgow, meets Dane Jhij Vierela.

THE Personal Investment Authority (PIA) has issued its guidelines over
how insurance companies and financial advisers should review cases of
possible pensions mis-selling. They will have to identify priority
cases, which are people who are coming up to retirement, have retired or
have since died leaving beneficiaries of their pension plans.
The industry estimates that some 350,000 people may fall into this
category and the aim is to compensate them by the end of the year.
The PIA's guidance relates to past pension opt-out business, whereby
members of company pension schemes were persuaded to leave in favour of
starting a personal pension plan or were persuaded not to join the
company scheme.
PIA members are expected to gather information about the investor,
their circumstances at the time of the opt-out and details of the scheme
they opted out of. Then they will have to carry out a compliance
assessment to determine the suitability of advice given.
Finally, any actual or potential loss will be calculated, though it is
envisaged that not every case will lead to an award as some customers
will have been responsible in whole or in part.
The authority will issue similar guidelines in relation to pension
transfer business in a few weeks time. It has set up an investor
helpline on 0171 417 7001.

HOUSEBUILDER and construction group Henry Boot has lifted profits by
7% from #7.59m to #8.16m before tax for 1994, its ninth successive year
of growth. Turnover advanced 12% from #165m to #184m. The dividend total
is hiked from 6.5p to 7.1p, maintaining the 9% half-year dividend
increase on earnings per share up from 20p to 21.8p.
The company's construction activities suffered in the second half, not
least from late and non-payment by clients, but housebuilding, property
development and investment, and plant hire performed exceptionally well.
The number of house sale completions, including those of the company's
joint venture activities, comfortably exceeded the 400 mark in the year
and Boot remains on course to meet its objective of gaining greater
share of the new-build housing market.
On the outlook, the company says that much will depend on Government
fiscal policies and the extent to which excess capacity and resultant
competition continues in the construction industry.
Above all, the degree to which confidence returns to the economy will
be guided by public perceptions of job security, interest rates and
taxation.
In the meantime, the balance sheet has continued to strengthen with
net assets increased by 7% to #48.5m, net current assets by 33% to
#23.7m and net cash in hand by 26% to #17.3m. Net assets per share have
advanced 6% from 173p to 184p per share.

TROUBLED Poundstretcher discount stores group Brown &amp; Jackson is to be
rescued by a #30m lifeboat launched by its leading shareholder.Pepkor, a
South African investment firm, has agreed to finance the Leeds-based
retailer with #20m in cash and is backing a rights issue of new shares
to raise a further #9.6m.
After the cash-call on terms of 17 shares for every three already
held, and a share consolidation, Pepkor will end up with at least 65.4%
of Brown &amp; Jackson.
The group also announced that it lost #16.3m during 1994, compared
with a pre-tax loss of #12.7m in the previous year. Again no dividend is
payable on losses per share of 2.5p against 2.4p.
''There is still a great amount to be done and a degree of uncertainty
still remains due to the tough retail conditions that prevail,'' it
said.
''The board is, however, optimistic about the future potential of the
business, although the outcome for the year will once again be heavily
dependent on Christmas trading.''

GLASGOW-based WEW Group, which is giving a new more sophisticated look
to its chain of discount stores, yesterday announced a 12.4% increase in
pre-tax profits for the half-year to January 31, despite the generally
depressed state of retail sales.
WEW said turnover at its stores, which sell everything from clothing
and footwear to household goods, rose 9.5% to #72.7m from #66.4m in the
first half of the previous financial year.
But this improvement was entirely due to the opening of new stores and
brisker business at a handful of existing ones that were refurbished.
Turnover at existing stores which had not been given a face-lift
slumped by 7.3%. Even after allowing for the impact of WEW's purchase of
Sega Games a year earlier, there was still a fall of 2%.
WEW's pre-tax profits rose to #5.8m during the six-month period from
#5.2m and the group maintained its interim dividend at 0.35p per share.
Adjusted earnings per Ordinary share fell to 2.41p from 2.72p.
WEW chairman Peter Carr, who began a reorganisation of the group in
late 1993, said that although sales at existing stores fell during the
first six months of the current financial year, which ends on July 31,
overall turnover was boosted by the opening of 12 new stores during the
period.
Some of these, including one opened at Clydebank in November, have
abandoned WEW's old ''pile it high, sell it cheap'' style of goods
presentation for a new more sophisticated layout similar to that used by
more up-market department stores such as British Home Stores and Marks &amp;
Spencer.
What Everyone Wants, the catchphrase that gave WEW its name, appears
to be a little more class as well as good value at the discount counter.
WEW aims to open 17 new stores by the end of the current financial
year, bringing its total to 78. A company spokesman said that by then a
quarter of all stores would be decked out with new more up-market
interiors and the refurbishment programme would continue in 1995-96.
WEW said overall sales in its core stores -- existing outlets which
had not yet been refurbished -- fell 7.3% in the six months to January
as a result of the weak state of the retail trade throughout the autumn.
But a company spokesman said there was a marked upturn of trade in the
first quarter of this year.
''Since January the like-for-like sales in core stores have recovered
and are now ahead,'' he said without giving details.

<HEADLINE>Retailers find it tough as chill wind blows through the High Street. House of Fraser profits dip despite increase in sales</HEADLINE>

THE High Street remains a difficult place for retailers the latest
casualty being the women's fashionwear chain Susan Woolf which is due to
cease trading next month.
House of Fraser occupies large chunks of Britain's major high streets
with flagship stores throughout the country, including Frasers in
Glasgow and Dickins &amp; Jones in Regent Street, London.
However, its size has not inured it to the chill winds blowing through
retailing as consumer confidence fails to show any significant uplift.
Trading in the second half of last year was badly affected by the
unseasonally warm autumn which meant that greater-than-anticipated
markdowns had to be made to shift stock.
This together with costs associated with the ongoing refurbishment
programme adversely impacted gross margins and the department store
group reported a #6.5m drop in annual pre-tax profits to #28m after
paying #8.5m in flotation costs.
Its maiden annual shareholders' payment is in line with earlier
forecasts at 5.5p after the payment of a final dividend of 3.8p.
Underlying sales grew by 8.4% last year although the rate of growth
slowed from 10% in the first half. There was little discernible
geographic difference in terms of trading although trading in its stores
in shopping centres and out- of-town locations was better than in the
High Steet stores.
House of Fraser has earmarked three underperforming stores for closure
which is expected to occur this year.
A few more stores are likely to go during the course of its five-year
revitalisation programme which started last year, its first as a public
company. However, Frasers sees scope for new store openings particularly
in new retail developments and in geographic locations where it is
currently absent.
As part of the refurbishment programme, the group's three largest
stores in Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham were upgraded in addition
to the first #4m phase of the four-year development to establish Dickins
&amp; Jones as one of the world's major department stores.
The aim of the total programme is to create an upmarket department
store group which is a key destination for shoppers seeking particular
brands. Greater emphasis is being placed on offering a core of
international brands which the management hopes will prove attractive to
its target age 35-plus audience.
The proportion of sales from concessions rose from 27% to 29% and is
expected to increase further in the current year. However, Frasers is
not abandoning its own-label merchandise indeed it intends to improve
the quality of the products on offer.
The FraserCard is seen as a key marketing took and the company is
hoping to further build on the 235,000 new accounts opened last year.
The average transaction on a FraserCard is #50 compared with #30 for
other customers. Just under a third of the group's total sales are done
via the FraserCard.
In line with the group's policy of reducing its merchandise range,
three stores, including Arnotts in Inverness, were converted into
speciality stores during the year. Further stores are earmarked for
conversion this year.
The movement to limited assortment or speciality stores in certain
locations involves a reduction in the levels of furniture, electrical
appliances and childrenswear. Better margins can be achieved in
womenswear, menswear, fashion accessories, cosmetics and homewares.
These days there is no point in any retailer having attractive
merchandise if it has not got modern efficient back-up away from the
shop floor. As part of its investment plans Frasers is upgrading its
information technology in areas such as purchasing. Initiatives have
been taken to reduce the supplier base and Christian Salvesen has been
taken on as a third-party distributor.
Capital expenditure was #29.4m last year and is expected to be around
#35m in the current year with the stores in Edinburgh and Perth among
those earmarked for refurbishment.
The recent tightening of the rules governing the growth of out-of-town
retail developments provides an opportunity for High Street retailers to
make themselves more attractive to shoppers. Frasers has a clear vision
of where it wants to be and what it wants to provide but it is likely to
be the 1996-97 financial year before tangible evidence is seen on the
bottom line.
Although the City was disappointed by the lacklustre trading
performance last year some retail analysts share the House of Fraser
management's faith in its long-term strategy.
John Richards of NatWest Securities said that now was an opportunity
to buy the shares. Analysts believe that the shares could rise from
current levels of 144p, down 8p, to over 160p in the medium term.

FIFE-based store-fitting group Havelock Europa, which is giving a new
look to High Street banks in Scotland, yesterday reported a 76% hike in
1994 pre-tax profits to #4.01m.
Havelock, whose biggest customers include Boots The Chemists, Marks &amp;
Spencer and House of Fraser, raised its total dividend by 50% to 3.0p,
after a final payout of 2.0p.
The group, whose head office and main factory is at Dalgety Bay, said
its order book at the end of March was ''materially ahead'' of its
position a year earlier. Turnover in the year to end-December was up 12%
at #39.6m.
Havelock's 1994 result was in line with its best-ever performance in
1988.
About 74% of Havelock's business was with the non-food retail sector
last year, but the design, manufacture and installation of interiors for
banks is developing into an important part of the business.
Havelock lined up a #3m contract to refurbish 40 branches of the Bank
of Scotland last autumn and has already fitted out new branches in
Greenock, Linlithgow, Falkirk, Dalkeith, Carnoustie and Dunbar. It is
likely that it will do significantly more work for the bank.
The store-fitter also did work for the TSB, National Westminster and
Co-operative banks and was involved in pilot projects with AT&amp;T Global
Information Solutions.
Together, Havelock and AT&amp;T did work for the First National Bank of
Southern Africa in Johannesburg and for Standard Chartered Bank in Hong
Kong.
Chief executive Hew Balfour said: ''We see opportunities to extend
work in the banking sector significantly this year.
''I expect to see an expansion both in the UK and overseas.''
In 1994, work for the financial services sector accounted for only 16%
of turnover, but during the first quarter of this year 49% of new orders
were in this area, a traditionally slack period for shop fit-outs.
With traditional retailers finding life relatively tough, and
store-fitters consequently having to fight for business, Havelock's move
into retail banking work appears wise.
Havelock laid down a strategy to penetrate new markets, particularly
banking, three years ago. It also opted for major investment in
manufacturing and design, coupled with tight cost control.
The group's broker, Allied Provincial Securities in Glasgow, is
forecasting a 30% increase in 1995 pre-tax profits to #5.2m. Putting
Havelock on a prospective price-earnings ratio of more than 15, the
stock is not cheap but Allied Provincial believes in the group's growth
potential.
Havelock shares put on 2p to 212p yesterday to yield 1.8%.

THE first signs were the blue tarpaulins. Here and there a roof was
covered in one, like the sheets which shrouded many a Glasgow tenement
after the great January gales of 1969.
As the Shinkansen -- the bullet train -- sped across the countryside,
those tarpaulins became more frequent. Then we rifled our way into a
long tunnel beneath Mount Rokko and they disappeared. At the station at
the other end all seemed busy and normal.
The ground in the tiny park in front of the station was covered in
tents. Some surrounding buildings were hidden behind scaffolding, but
the cherry blossom was out and the sense of a normal, sunny spring day
persisted.
The first real clue was a public phone booth, frozen at a lurching
angle, closed against use by official-looking tape. Then some buckled
kerbstones. And, over there, some cladding missing from the facade of a
building.
As the taxi crawled downhill in the heavy traffic towards the centre
of town, the signs of damage multiplied. A concrete column, shattered
halfway up, had its steel reinforcing rods bellied out grotesquely, as
if some giant had been pogoing on it until it gave way under his weight.
At the busy junction at Sannomiya railway station, the full horror of
what had befallen Kobe exactly three months before revealed itself. The
back of the Sogo department store was a yawning gash, counters and
display cases still hanging perilously from shattered floors above a
great mountain of rubble.
All around mechanical diggers were picking at shattered buildings like
noisy insects. Overhead a whole section of the platform at Sannomiya had
simply disappeared. But already the trains were running again. And
around the corner in the Pachinko parlour -- one of thousands of
Japanese pinball arcades whose annual turnover, I'm told, now rivals
that of the entire Japanese car industry -- it was almost business as
usual.
We are headed for City Hall, just beyond the junction. The first
offices are deserted. Just before six o'clock on the morning of January
17, when what they now call the Great Hanshin Earthquake struck, the
entire sixth floor of City Hall 1 collapsed. The floors above moved a
couple of metres to the right and now sit drunkenly on the lower five.
Next door, the more modern 30-something storeys of City Hall 2 stand
erect and undamaged apart from a few dislodged marble tiles in the
foyer.
Homeless people are now living here, some 50 of them, in makeshift
cardboard-partitioned corners. Upstairs Mr Sakurai spreads a map and
enumerates the price the earth extracted when it moved under Awaji
Island and sent its convulsive tremors rippling along Kobe's narrow
coastal plane.
Five thousand, three hundred and fifty-seven people died. One more is
still missing. A further 14,679 were injured. Fifty-four thousand nine
hundred and forty-nine buildings were totally destroyed. A further
31,783 were badly damaged. The overhead motorways collapsed at 10
different points. The total economic cost is officially put at 10
trillion yen (#80bn). It could, says Mr Sakurai with a shrug, turn out
to be two or three times that.
Kobe was Japan's major container port. All 116 kilometres of wharves
-- 239 berths in all -- were destroyed or damaged, including those on
two man-made islands. Other local businesses, from steel and
ship-building to synthetic shoe and sake production, have been badly
disrupted.
The arithmetic of destruction is awesome. But Kobe is determindly
clawing its way back to normal. Thirty per cent of the port is working
again. Electricity and phone lines were back within days. Water supplies
are back everywhere. All but a few isolated areas have had gas restored.
''Our greatest concern is that Tokyo's interest in Kobe is waning,''
says Mr Sakurai. ''There are so many other things going on, like the
subway gas attack and the high appreciation of the yen. Interest in our
plight may be wearing thin, perhaps.''
Certainly government officials I had talked to in Tokyo earlier were
keen to play down the overall economic significance of what happened in
Kobe. ''I was astonished when I read in your Financial Times a report
that the Kansai economy is equivalent to the entire Italian economy,''
said one. ''The area of the Kansai which is damaged is so small, I
almost wrote in with a correction.''
By February, he continued, overall Japanese industrial production was
back to normal levels . So were exports. The Toyota car plants had lost
only four shifts when key parts-suppliers in Kobe were hit. ''Of course
there has been an effect on private consumption. But when relatives in
the Kobe area are facing such difficulties, it is only natural that
people don't go out and spend money for a while,'' he went on, quickly
pointing out that personal expenditure in that region was back to normal
by March.
Three trillion yen has already been earmarked in two supplementary
government budgets to help finance the Kobe reconstruction.
''Remember,'' said my Tokyo bureaucrat, ''the initial estimate of the
total damage at Kobe is only two per cent of Japan's nominal gross
domestic product for one year.''
As we left Kobe to return to Kyoto by a local train, the route took us
along the main path of the tremors that night in January, the path
traced by Mr Sakurai's finger on his map. Even then I was not prepared
for the sustained scale of the destruction.
It was as if some giant invisible hand had swept across that hapless
littoral, sweeping blue and brown glazed roof tiles from house after
house after house, reducing the fragile wooden structures beneath to
matchwood and stubbing out life after life in the process.
0 Kobe will rebuild itself. Of that I have no doubt. Perhaps, on a
part of the earth's crust where natural disasters are an ever-present
danger, the will to overcome nature depends as much on the clinical
detachment of seasoned bureaucrats hundreds of miles away as on the grit
of those who suffer so calamitously.
They say housing reconstruction will be completed within three years,
if sites on this densely populated land fringed by mountains can be
found. The highway rebuilding programme, too, may take three years. The
port should be fully back in service by the end of 1996.
Strange, is it not that it takes us up to three or four times as long
to attempt to regenerate much smaller areas hit, not by earthquakes, but
by industrial decline, poverty and urban dereliction.

LISTEN to this mince: ''Once upon a time, nurseries were places
decorated in the palest pastels. Babies and children, it seemed, were
destined to spend their earliest years exposed to nothing stronger than
anaemic yellows, pink, and blues''. A horror that really.
I remember my nursery. It was painted in the clearest iron grey and
called an air-raid shelter. Later my nursery was the room we all lived
in but there was a nice wee patterned curtain in front of us. This was
the other bedroom.
It was in fact the bed recess and whatever passions my mama and papa
indulged in the wee box behind the drapes, I suspect, on Sunday
afternoons when we children had gone off to sing By Cool Siloam's Shady
Rill of an afternoon after morning service at the United Free
Presbyterian Church across the way.
My daddy was, in fact, deeply agnostic but horribly religious on a
Sunday when it came to giving my pretty mother what was after all her,
as well as his, conjugal rights. His rights, in short, were more
important than his children's rites and quite right, (rite) too. Anyway
we didn't have much of a nursery at all. There's a wee dose of working
class credentials to be going on with.
But the mince gets even more of a slurry of words. Talking of pale
pastels and the like does not our writer go on to state that: ''All that
is long past. Today's tinies have visual stimulation from every quarter:
vibrant colours, bright interesting patterns on wall coverings and
fabrics, all joining forces to create truly imaginative rooms.''
Sweet God, a journalist wrote that but the other week in this very
blatt. And it is up to your Urban Voltaire to comment upon this drivel.
Truly imaginative rooms? The very start of that much-reviled novel No
Mean City has sibling sexual abuse, right in the opening chapter because
back then when the book was written boys and girls shared one room,
along with, as I have intimated above, parents.
The only imagination given rein then was sexual. Or maybe about food.
Not for us the bedroom of wur ain. Eventually of course, (one of the
brothers pissed off, smartish, to London), I had my own room. I can just
imagine my daddy suggesting that he should make the cell I snored and
farted in of a night into something truly imaginative.
But once upon a time nurseries, if our author is to be believed were
decorated in palest pastels. Well of course they were. Once upon a time
children went to their bed early with Ovaltine before it and a lullaby
from your daddy and a kiss and hug from your mother and went gently off
to sleep. Their were no vibrant colours and no vibrant television shows
first thing in the morning.
Even when I was older as a child the last thing I heard was Sailing
By from the BBC, the end of the Home Service. I slept like a baby. Back
then the vibrancy of vibrancy was considered not conducive to bringing
up children, and it isn't now either.
For today's children are led into hyperactivity by television and
bright colours dancing like fire in their minds. Every parent out there
knows what I mean. From the moment the children open their eyes till the
moment, exhausted by vitality, they are assaulted by visual vim and
vigour, especially vim, the scouring powder of information. Everything
the modern child retains when it comes to knowledge is cleared away,
ready for a new onslaught of mince.
It is very expensive mince though and the parents pay for it. Here I
am telling you how to bring up weans. I should know: I don't have any.
Has it occurred to you that perhaps the best people to tell you with any
authority at all about how bring up children as we bleed into the next
century are those of us without them?
The parents are too sodding busy painting their brats rooms with a
view to visual stimulation -- visual stimulation might just be thought
of as books or trips round art galleries -- to have the slightest sense
about to turn weans into citizens.
Virtually every wee visigoth I ever taught was brought up with enough
vibrancy to make them mentally ill. Virtually every nice child I met was
brought up with what might be considered an old fashioned lack of it.
Cut down on the vibrancy, the vitality, the vim and the vigour when it
comes to time for your little ones to go to bed.
Perhaps this is sentimentality: I damn well know it is. But I rather
liked that slow gentleness when you disapeared into the land of
counterpane, and dusk lowered the lashes and it became quiet enough for
childhood to repair itself. I'll bet the parents out there with the
vibrant nurseries agree with me.

WE don't know much about art but were quite taken by the catalogue for
Triple Vision, an exhibition which opens this weekend at the Glasgow
Print Studio. The works by the three artists -- James McDonald, Neil
MacPherson, and Douglas Thomson -- are of course brilliant, and we would
have said so without the artists clubbing together to buy the Diary a
pint.
Even more entertaining is the quality of the essays which have been
penned about each artist. Robert Maclennan, the Liberal Democrat MP,
contributes the essay on MacPherson, a fellow Caithness person.
He writes: ''The imaginative world of Neil MacPherson must be entered
with caution. All is not what it seems. The eye must accommodate to the
immediate brilliance of colour before the mind can absorb the delicate
chiaroscuro of feeling. The solidity of the architectonic forms is
belied by a falling leaf.
''The spectacle of a couple bonded in statuesque immobility dislimns
and is replaced by awareness of their guarded, tense separateness. The
foolish sheep is anthropomorphically transformed into a knowing, patient
companion . . .''
Mr Maclennan, whose day job is president of the Liberal Democrats, is
a very sober sort of person so it's not a case of can we have a
half-pint of what he had before he wrote about the anthropomorphic sheep
and the delicate chiaroscuro. We have to conclude that Oor Bob is a
serious and very heavyweight art critic.
No less a literary figure than Auberon Waugh has penned the essay on
James McDonald. Waugh has a number of the Glasgow artist's works in his
London home. He writes: ''The soft embrace of fashion, like the flimsy
knickers which worry McDonald so much, would prove the kiss of death to
his fine, angry genius . . .
''One only has to see an apple painted by McDonald to recognise the
skill of an Old Master. A rarer gift, which he discovered early on, was
to discover beauty in rusty old pieces of machinery, tatteed books, tin
cans, test tubes and flasks, bottles of poison, hypodermic syringes.
''Even in the least overtly erotic trompes l'oiel or still lifes there
is often a sense of eeriness, as if the artist's clarity of perception
carries an element of sexual voyeurism. This may be less obvious in the
apples than in the grapes and plums; by the time he advances to
knickers, it can be uncomfortable.''
Peter McDougall's contribution on Douglas Thomson majors on the
violent and threatening nature of the paintings. (Well, both boys are
from Greenock.) McDougall writes: ''I'm in the privileged position of
having a few of his paintings and couldn't escape their haunting
presence if I tried . . . And I have . . . I've seen me duck under them
to get myself from one room to another, safely . . . those
three-dimensional penetrating eyes that dance between humour and
violence and disturbingly track to you to the acutest of angles, makes
his figures vibrantly and menacingly alive.'' Foolish sheep, knickers,
and violence. What more could you want from an art exhibition?

GREAT Juxtapositions of Our Time: The back page of the Daily Mirror
yesterday carried the football scoreline Celtic 0, Hearts 1 immediately
adjacent to an advert placed by the RC church headed ''Why Be A
Catholic?''
Ducking questions
THE spate of gun violence in the Paisley area was reflected in the
list of parliamentary written questions and answers in Hansard this
week. Paisley South MP Gordon McMaster asked the Scottish Secretary ''if
he will make a statement on the protection available to witnesses and
informants who pass on to the police information relating to the
protection of drug dealers''.
Tommy Graham, MP for neighbouring West Renfrewshire, is also worried
about guns. He put down seven questions to the Secretary of State on the
subject of the shooting of eider ducks in the vicinity of shellfish
farms. Including: ''To ask the Secretary of State what advice he has
received from Scottish Natural Heritage on the issuing of licences to
kill eider ducks during 1994.''
Mr Graham's concern is not limited to the eider duck. He also asked
about the shooting of barnacle geese in Orkney. Perhaps they speak of
little else in Linwood.
Don't blink
THE Royal Scottish National Orchestra sets out next month on its
series of prom concerts in the cities of Dundee, Aberdeen, Edinburgh,
and Glasgow. We notice that the last night of the proms in Dundee is on
May 20. Which last night seems to follow on awfy quickly from the first
night on May 19.
THE leafy calm of the Scots College in Rome, where generations of
Tartan Tims have gone to learn their priestly trade, has been disturbed
of late. The college is situated in Via Cassia in an upmarket suburb of
the Eternal City.
Unfortunately the Via Cassia was chosen by an advertising company as
just the perfect site for one of their hoardings. Thus the view of the
college is now disfigured by a billboard. Even worse, the billboard
advertises an establishment called Sexy Shops Cobra.
There is nothing the Scots College can do about the offending advert
since the Italian planning laws allow the company to place their
advertisements more or less where they want.
There being no court of appeal on this earth, the folk at Scots
College have been putting their case to a higher authority.

WATER? Let them drink champagne. My word, if you saw them sprinkling
the courts at the Club de Tenis Manolo Santana, in Marbella, you
wouldn't believe there was drought on the Costa del Sol. And a river
runs through it; or at least, an underground stream, which bubbles forth
to water the sub-tropical gardens of the Hotel Puente Romano.
''You see?'' said the lively lady from press and public relations.
''There is plenty of water for those who have dug their own wells. We
have no problem in the hotel.'' None the less, even private reservoirs
must be topped up from somewhere, and as visitors from the land of rain
and plenty, we thought it only fair to go easy on the faucets.
My friend the magazine editor and I have been working in Marbella. She
was checking out locations for fashion shoots, I was garnering material
for travel features; but it being the Easter holidays we took our
daughters with us -- one 11 and the other 12. I won't pretend their
presence didn't turn our trip into something of a holiday.
The night we arrived, like pups off the leash, they disappeared into
the hotel gardens for a moonlight swim; and when I say gardens I'm
talking 10 acres of landscaped jungle. We working mothers were already
late for dinner with the general manager ''and some of our town's
leading residents'', but spent 40 minutes trying and failing to find
them.
Distraught, the maternal imagination in overdrive (''Girls Abducted
While Mothers Dine With Marbella Glitterati'') we stumbled into our
party of guests and commanded a young man, who seemed to be an
undermanager, to search for our daughters.
He soon returned, to report charmingly that they were back inside,
ordering supper on room service. ''They are perfectly safe here,'' he
assured us. ''We have excellent security.'' His manners were unusually
elegant, even by the standards of smart hotel functionaries. Later we
learned that we'd tersely dispatched the nephew of Prince Alfonso von
Hohenlohe to round up our children.
Prince Alfonso, who is still big on the coast, was the man who
''made'' Marbella when he settled there after the war, built the
Marbella Club and eventually turned it into a hotel. I'm not clued up on
the noble families of Europe, or the noble families of anywhere, but my
pal's magazine has a famous social column, and she knows these things.
''Don't you remember that amazing wedding on the Grand Canal in
Venice? He married Princess Ira von Furstenberg when she was only 15.''
Relaxed at last, we turned our attention to the dinner party, and saw
we were seriously undercapitalised in the wardrobe department. It being
only spring, Marbella woman was dressed as if for Christmas cocktails at
Claridges.
We were wearing crumpled cotton (the travelling iron wouldn't work),
and the editor's footwear drew glances: she'd kicked off her office
shoes at the airport, handed them to her husband and replaced them with
plimsoles -- forgetting she'd packed nothing niftier for the feet.
On my left was a friendly blonde, coutured by Versace and uplifted by
Wonderbra. She introduced herself as Gunilla von Bismarck (''Countess!''
hissed my well-informed chum) and I said the name sounded familiar. As
we chatted, I realised I was talking to a founder member of the Marbella
jet set. She said she lived ''next door'' to the club; she mentioned an
apartment in Monte Carlo; ski-ing at St Moritz; carnival in Rio; Ascot
in June.
Fatigue and wine released my sense of the ridiculous and made me
daring. ''Why!'' I exclaimed. ''You're an authentic jet-setter! A career
socialite! One of a dying breed!'' Gunilla laughed merrily, unoffended.
''Yes, but these days I have to earn my living, too. I bring people
together, help them make contacts. I'm a facilitator.'' (Later we saw
her facilitating at the Marbella Club, clutching a clipboard to her
designer denims, tete-a-tete with three men in suits.
The talk turned to Gunilla's Scottish neighbour. ''How is Sean?'' she
asked. ''We haven't seen him for a while; or Micheline, who is such
fun.'' I was enjoying this sport, and said with authority: ''They're in
America at the moment. They have a house in Malibu, too, you know,'' as
if I were intimate with the domestic arrangements of the world's
greatest living Scotsman and his wife.
Big Tam's presence on ''the Golden Mile'' is signalled only by a dish
called Spaghetti Connery, served in a pizzeria in Puerto Banus. He has
always been reclusive, but in any case his celebrity has been overtaken
by Marbella's new superstar: Jesus Gil y Gil, local mayor and national
megalomaniac.
Gil's eccentric style of civic leadership has cleaned up Marbella,
cleared out its 80s population of minor drug dealers and petty
criminals, and invented for the office of mayor of this middle-ranking
coastal town, population 70-odd thousand, a status more comparable to
that of big-city boss.
Gil has both heavy hand and light touch. He's made the local police
force taller, burlier and more numerous, and he's pulled some
spectacularly theatrical stunts, like marching through the marina
shouting ''Scum!'' at the drunks. His latest wheeze takes place this
Sunday, when he will supply the limos for the ceremonies of the first 10
Marbella couples to be married under a new Spanish law, permitting civil
weddings.
He is, we were told, a little ''bruto'' in manner; large, loud,
vulgarly dressed (the old English idiom ''common as muck'' popped into
our heads); a self-made property developer from the province of Leon,
who spent time in prison after a restaurant built by his company fatally
collapsed on its customers. And he's wildly popular in Marbella; less so
in Estepona, where he has pushed some of Marbella's erstwhile problems.
Still, Jesus Gil y Gil can do something about that, too. The local
elections are about to take place, and he has installed his son as
mayoral candidate in Estepona. A Gil dynasty is in the making; a Gil
national party, acronymically called Grupo Independiente Liberal
(policies liberally to the right), has already been founded, its profile
helped by the fact that he's chairman of Atletico Madrid.
After five days of listening to the lore, we longed to see the legend.
On our penultimate day, while we were lunching with the general manager
of the Marbella Club, the maitre d' sidled up to whisper something in
his ear. Gil was on his way! A posse of dark-suited men swept into the
beach restaurant: minders, bodyguards, acolytes, associates; at their
hub a tall, paunchy figure in bright green jacket and splashy tie,
cuddling a mobile to his ear, his face a caricaturist's commission.
City bosses never lunch alone, or even a deux. They lunch to be seen,
and we did our share of staring. It was hard not to burst into applause
when the mayor and his retinue presented their tableaux vivant of
fast-track power and all sat down.

THIRTY years before the M77 protesters were chaining themselves to the
Pollok trees the New Glasgow Society was expressing its concern at the
effect upon the city of a #485m, 285-mile motorway plan for Glasgow.
Today, with only one-tenth of that plan completed, the society is
still pressing for an alternative integrated public-transport system.
Almost forgotten are past battles to restore tenements, modernise the
subway, stoneclean buildings, stop a downstream oil refinery, or save
Great Western Road from a six-lane expressway.
Needless to say, derision greeted such ideas as city tourist and
public relations units, riverside walkways, pedestrian streets, and an
exhibition centre for the redundant Queen's Dock. Today they all feature
prominently in Glasgow's promotional material.
Next week (April 23-30) the New Glasgow Society celebrates 30 years of
successes -- and failures -- with a series of events ranging from the
inaugural Victorian Walk to a Glasgow film night and a civic reception
culminating in a ''Winners-and-Losers'' bus tour of 38 past campaigns.
However this week the society has objected to the demolition of eight
listed buildings for the proposed #200m M74 extension into the city, and
is asking Parliament to intervene in the controversial CrossRail scheme
which plans to resite its stations at High Street and Glasgow Cross
further away from busy traffic areas.
The 30-year-old fight ''to encourage high standards of architecture
and town planning in the Glasgow region'' continues.

I AM pleased to note that at last it has been publicised (April 12)
that not only chairmen and managing directors, eg British Gas, but other
senior executives, as in Rolls-Royce, have been prepared to feather
their personal nests without any apparent concern for the workforce in
terms of salary or security of employment.
Each time another massive salary increase to a notable senior
executive has been broadcast I have wondered about the rest of the board
who voted this and how far down the salary ladder such inflated
increases extend before striking the 3%-4% awarded to the workforce.
Although not apparently so newsworthy, other higher grades presumably
get a slice of the cake.
The board of R-R as a whole are reported to have awarded themselves
27% on average, so there must have been awards of even more than that of
the chairman Sir Ralph Robins, a mere 18%.
You report that the RR profits were ''boosted by plant closures and a
fall in Research and Development spending''. Apparently the directors
have claimed credit for this while ignoring that for a company of RR's
status this is equivalent to not only selling off the family silver but
also the future seedcorn.
The favoured self-justification of high executive salary increases is
a need to prevent the loss of personnel to even higher-paid posts
clamouring for their services. If this is the case, why did these
executives remain in such relatively poorly paid positions in most cases
for many years?
This general malaise of high boardroom increases, relative to rewards
to the workforce, and the questionable justification is being allowed to
continue with minimal comment from the Government in contrast with their
outrage in the 1970-80s over union-backed industrial wage claims based
on comparisons with similar workers in the UK or Europe.
Whatever happened to the Prime Minister's target of a fair society?
Robert Machin,

THE car bomb in Oklahoma City, the heart of rural America, spells an
end to the false sense of security the United States has enjoyed long
after the rest of the world has come to terms with terrorism. It is an
end to innocence, the possible beginning of a nightmare. The guilty must
be brought to account, as President Clinton has pledged, because this is
a crime against the world, not just America. The United States has
plenty of experience of terrorism overseas -- its embassies, notably in
Beirut, have been lethally attacked -- but at home it is another matter.
Had the bomb exploded in London, Paris, Rome, Jerusalem, or Buenos Aires
people would have reacted with equal horror to the carnage, but in the
knowledge that such outrages happen, often as part of the continuing war
Islamic fundamentalists are waging against the rest of society. The
United States has not completely escaped the terrorist threat. A bomb
planted by Islamic terrorists at the World Trade Centre in New York
three years ago killed six people and injured nearly a thousand, but
that was in New York, a cosmopolitan city where violence and the need
for security are understood. In heartland America such atrocities do not
occur. Disasters in Oklahoma tend to be natural, caused by the weather,
something to be thankful for since it meant much of the rescue equipment
and some of the expertise required was available.
The bombing will cause panic and dismay across the United States
because it brings Americans face to face with the unknown. One need only
recall how they stayed away from Europe when terrorists were bombing our
cities to realise the impact on the American psyche. Never glad
confident morning again. America is vast. For many of its citizens,
especially in its heartlands, the outside world barely exists. They have
no need to know. Everything they require is within their own borders.
The shock waves from this bomb mean nobody in the United States can ever
feel safe again. That could have two effects. The tendency to
inward-looking isolationism could be halted in its tracks, or it could
be strengthened. One can only hope it is the former; that a better
understanding of both the world at large and the need to be part of it
results, not a pulling down of shutters. When one is a citizen of the
greatest power on earth the temptation for the ordinary man or woman to
feel invulnerable, to behave ostrich-like, to get on with life
regardless, is overwhelming. The Oklahoma bomb has shattered that
illusion.
So far nobody has made a convincing claim to be responsible, and
nobody has been blamed. On the face of it, however, this is the work of
Islamic fundamentalists. Which group is anybody's guess, although the
bomb is said to be similar to the World Trade Centre bomb. Israeli
intelligence apparently warned Washington an attack was imminent, which
may have prompted the choice of target because security there and in New
York was stepped up. The Alfred P Murrah building was not an obvious
target, although several important federal operations are based there,
including the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, which was responsible for the
disastrous Waco seige two years ago. Members of the Davidian cult have,
however, denied responsibility.
Political terrorists, invariably inspired by misguided nationalism,
are containable in that their acts have a logical purpose -- to
influence political decisions by violence. If the enemy is identified,
counter intelligence can infiltrate their ranks. Religious fanatics are
another matter. Their groups are not concerned with changing public
opinion, but with ending the existence of their enemies by any means.
Wanting nothing they can be given, they cannot be negotiated with. The
IRA and the PLO, both of which have waged terrorist campaigns, are cases
in point. Their bombings were part of a calculated strategy to shift
public opinion by violence. They could be negotiated with.
Americans now have to come to terms with the time-consuming and
frustrating demands of security -- checks at airports, at the entrances
to public buildings, restricted on-street parking, and so on. The world
will have to come to terms with the fact that even the greatest power is
vulnerable. Terrorists have taken it one more step down the road to
anarchy.

A NATURAL suspicion attaches itself to good linguists. We envy their
ability to cope with Paris taxi-drivers, perhaps, or to understand the
sports headlines in La Stampa. Nevertheless, it does suggest the
existence, perhaps generations removed, of foreign blood. When nations
have a long history of being overrun, it is understandable that they
should gain a facility in other tongues. If, like Great Britain, a
country builds empires, conquers dictators, etc, the need is not so
pressing. We expect other people to learn English, not merely because it
is a superior language, but because it is the easiest solution. There
seems little reason to doubt that all the world will one day speak
English, if only to cope with computer programs. Of the world's existing
6000 languages, it is said that between 20% and 50% are no longer being
learned by children. The latest to become extinct was Pomo, a language
from the Californian mountains, where the last person to speak it, Mrs
Edna Guerro, has just died at the age of 90.
It is unlikely, given the present vigilance, that the same fate will
ever overtake French or German. The French National Assembly has even
introduced a system of fines, going up to 20,000 francs, for the public
use of English when a French phrase is available. The Academie Francaise
deems that many words, like ''le bookmaker'', ''le bulldozer'', and ''le
clergyman'', have become French by adoption.
Britain has an educational interest in the matter, because the loss of
French, German, Italian, etc, would threaten the jobs of British
academics. Interpreting the works of Racine or Goethe may have little
relevance to everyday life, its purpose being almost entirely to
instruct others how to do the same thing, but if children are not taught
foreign languages, subjects far more harmful could take their place.
The satisfactory nature of the present situation was indicated in a
business survey this week which reported that when leading British firms
received calls in a foreign language, 74% of telephonists hung up. It is
an entirely natural reaction, even if it loses a few exports. As the
switchboard operators explained, there is no telling what the callers
might have been saying.

ROBBIE Dinwoodie's contribution to reducing ''testosterone in the body
politic'' needs to be considered in the light of a cool shower of
political fact (April 18).
He argues that his preferred system would give ''proportional
representation by transferable vote''. This is not the case. Having a
pair of MPs for each constituency is simply a variant on the present
first-past-the-post electoral system, with its characteristically unjust
results.
In his zeal for gender balance, Robbie Dinwoodie fails to see that a
fair and democratic Parliament needs to be proportionately
representative of the nation's political preferences as well as of its
gender balance.
Robbie Dinwoodie recognises that Liberal Democrats object on principle
to 50:50 membership of the Scottish parliament; yet he mis-states the
principle. Liberal Democrats believe in leaving maximum power in the
hands of the electorate in choosing their representative, and maximum
power in the hands of party members in choosing their candidates.
He rightly notes that there are already certain disbarments on
standing for Parliament: insanity, bankruptcy, military service, and
membership of the Upper House. There are good reasons for all these: if
this is the basis of his argument it is weak indeed.
Nor does our excellent (though by no means perfect) record in
promoting women make our position ''a curious one''. On the contrary,
Scottish Liberal Democrat experience shows that where there is the
political will gender equality can be advanced without the coercive
application of statute.
The plan for an ''electoral contract'' between the Scottish Liberal
Democrats and the Scottish Labour Party -- to be debated at our
conference next week -- is indeed a historic achievement.
The contract commits both parties to fielding equal numbers of male
and female candidates for the first elections to the Scottish parliament
only. The contract also takes into account the winability of seats, so
that gender equality will extend into the Scottish parliament.
The first Scottish parliament provides us with a historic opportunity
to create a radically different and new political institution. It is an
opportunity not to be missed. That is why we want to see an equal number
of women elected at the start, and why we are prepared to enter into
this contract to see it achieved.

I WOULD regard it as adding insult to injury should a Scottish Office
Minister perform the official opening of the Skye road bridge.
It is bad enough that this privately-funded crossing brings with it
the costliest toll charges in Europe. The project ought to have been
funded entirely by the Scottish Office in due recognition of the
exceptional circumstances of geographical location and fragile island
economy.
It might have been an entirely different tale had political careers
been there to bargain with.

FROM time to time I ponder how it is that my perceptions of Germany,
France, and other neighbouring nation states have changed over the past
few decades.
In the 1950s and 1960s I, and subsequently my family, used to derive
so much pleasure from visits to such countries; use of their languages,
consumption of their wines and foods, and most of all the sights and
sounds of their villages.
The scent of their tobacco and the experience of their countryside as
it were of one, splendid herb garden.
Wartime tensions had somehow receded and the political deployment of
those countries in that era was so very unimportant. Many people from
the UK gained considerable enjoyment and registered a fair degree of
Euro-affection as a result of these vacations in Western Europe.
How is it, then, that the evocative, sensual apprehensions of sojourns
in these European countries have been supplanted by (for example) such
unhappy, discordant images involving common agricultural and fisheries
policies and suspect political figures?
In all probability Hamlet best expresses the change: ''The time is out
of joint''.

FOR those of us who had been brought up in the immediate aftermath of
the Second World War, life was primary schooldays, sweets still on
ration-book coupons, and those long summer holidays in the sunshine of
Glasgow's parks.
We had been mostly unaware of what happened during the grim years.
Until one day in 1955, on an outing to the children's matinee at a
cinema near us, we wept as we watched, uncomprehending, violence and
horror in a Pathe News compilation documentary called Ten Years After.
It was not the loveliest of wars, although some may have found it more
tolerable than others. In his essential book, Glasgow -- the Making of a
City, Andrew Gibb tells how our heavy engineering and shipbuilding were
already facing post-industrial decline by the turn of the century. Those
two world wars reprieved Clydeside's manufacturing base, and brought
full employment -- the benefits of which were to last until the late
1950s. There also began that post-war municipal and private-sector
housing boom; the first green shoots of today's relative prosperity.
With the 1960s came a new era. Cinema audiences gasped at Hitchcock's
Psycho; and then there was napalm. When they appeared later, the guns
and the Semtex of Northern Ireland seemed almost humane in comparison
with the Vietnam War. Berlin, and Europe, had become politically,
ideologically, and physically divided.
During those 45 years of cold war the threat of nuclear annihilation
hung over the world like a dark cloud. Even so, British youth of our
generation were never to be called-up for compulsory military service.
In March of 1985, a new man assumed the presidency of the Soviet Union.
Thus our apocalyptic nightmare of a nuclear holocaust never
materialised. Mushroom clouds did not, after all, burgeon over Great
Britain; Argyle Street was not consumed in the unimaginable temperature
of a nuclear fireball. And, except for the scrapped bridge section that
disappeared under the burner's torch, Glasgow Central Station's steel
girders remain unmelted. But the Warsaw Pact and Berlin's infamous wall
are no more. Fifty years of peace in our time.
And so what must the collective ''we'' remember in May 1995? It is
victory in Europe. But it is also mind-numbing statistics. It is the few
in that summer of 1940, to whom so many owed so much. And it is the
many, to whom we will always owe a debt of gratitude; a generation of
youth destroyed in the prime of life.
It is those who rest in unknown graves. It is our finest, and still
our most fearful hour during the Blitz. It is the civilians, those
innocent victims on the home front of the combatants. It is inspired
speeches, the courage, and the unfaltering faith of Britain's wartime
leader -- the Churchillian legend that will last for 1000 years.
And it is -- that which can for all time symbolise the heart-rending
inhumanity of war through the ages, from antiquity to this present day
-- the hysterical Auschwitz mother who realises that she will never see
her children again in this life.
In May of 1995 we shall, by our own diverse means and in some
inexplicable sense, reach back through these past five decades and
across to the opposite bank of the Mythological River, and say to those
who wait there: we know, we understand, we will remember you.

OH dear, John Macleod has been taking the Orange pills again. This
time, he is really hallucinating (April 18).
I can accept his ignorance of Irish history. After all it is not his
country, although he should know -- to correct just two errors in his
ill-informed diatribe -- that Irish Republicanism was founded by
Protestants and that Sinn Fein took 75% of the seats in the 1918
all-Ireland election.
I can accept, too, that blind bigotry might cause a man to say that
Irish nationalism is a folk myth, although with over eight centuries of
resistance to foreign domination on the clock it must be a remarkably
potent one. (And if it is a myth, who are these Irish nationalists he
keeps referring to?)
But I will not allow this slur on the memory of James Connolly to go
unchallenged. This Edinburgh-born socialist is respected the world over,
not just because of his part in the Easter Rising, but through the
pioneering trade union work which he carried out in America, Britain,
and Ireland (for Catholic and Protestant workers).
Even his opponents were hard put to say anything against the character
of Connolly. The British Army surgeon who treated him in the wake of the
Dublin fighting described him as ''the bravest man I ever saw''.
If he is in hell, I would not want to go to heaven: it would probably
be full of people like John Macleod.

DURING my hospitalisation recently I began reading Enid Blyton, a
biography by Barbara Stoney, so I read with interest the article,
Japanese give the nod to Big Ears (April 14).
How sad that people today, with all the dreadful immoral, violent,
pornographic books and films available, have to find fault and read
devious motives into innocent stories which have survived decades.
Enid Blyton (whose books I read when I was 12) may not have been
perfect and who herself had difficulties in her life, wrote stories with
good, wholesome moral tales which captivated the hearts of many
children.  Reading her books certainly didn't prevent me from reading
other literature. I read Enid Blyton stories to our children (two of
whom are at university) and if I'm blessed with grandchildren I shall
certainly read her stories to them and I shall not be ashamed to mention
Big Ears or the fact that he had a gay time with Noddy in the woods!

LOOKING over my file of relevant press cuttings I find an article
written by Jack Webster (Perspective, February 15, 1993). It is as
relevant today as it was on the day he put pen to paper.
He was in Derby interviewing Stewart Miller, a favourite son of
Kirkcaldy, and boss of the entire Aerospace Group of Rolls-Royce, on the
winning of the contract to supply engines for the European Fighter
Aircraft.
Webster wrote: ''Mr Miller knows better than most what cancellation
would have meant to British industry, not least his own company's
commitment to places like Hillington and East Kilbride.''
He develops the theme that Rolls-Royce success leaves the way ''still
open for the young graduate with talent and ambition''.
As an ex-employee, the loyal servant of the company, my breast swelled
with pride as I read these remarks.
He quotes Stewart Miller as saying, ''We have made a vast investment
in Hillington and East Kilbride and the long-term future is good. There
will be growth in the engines business for commercial airlines. As far
as I can see, on the military side, there will also be a continuing need
for countries to defend themselves.''
It now seems to me that the people who need to defend themselves from
the present Rolls-Royce management are the highly skilled, highly
qualified engineers facing the sack at East Kilbride, contrary to all
the expectations of Mr Miller.

GOLFER Nick Faldo has been asked to back the fight to save two
closure-threatened factories which make Pringle pullovers.
Faldo is said to have earned more than #1m by wearing the famous
knitwear at tournaments around the world.
Leaders of the GMB and T &amp; G unions in Scotland who represent the
Pringle workers facing the sack in Arbroath and Kilwinning have faxed a
letter to the golfer from the STUC seeking his support.
It follows delegates backing an emergency motion calling on Dawson
International to reconsider its closure proposals.
Union officials tell the golfer in their letter that the highly
skilled textile workers take great pride in the quality of the produce
and are angry that Dawson's have treated their skill, commitment and
loyalty with such contempt.
''Just as you are proud to wear Pringle sweaters, the Scottish
workforce is proud that its skills have helped make Pringle products
such sought-after top-of-the-range clotheswear,'' it states. ''The
workforce and communities have asked Dawson to reconsider.''
It concludes that ''we respecfully seek your support in our campaign
to defend the Pringle jobs and protect the Scottish communities. A
combination of one of the world's greatest golfers and one of the
world's most expert workforces may make Dawson International think
again.''

THE result of a ballot for industrial action by postal workers in
Scotland will be declared on Monday.
The workers are angry that the Royal Mail is dropping May Day as a
public holiday for its employees.
A vote in favour of action is likely, and the union is contemplating a
one-day stoppage or a rolling programme of stoppages in different areas.
The row came to a head because the Post Office did not want to give
the 50th anniversary celebration of VE Day as an extra holiday.
Instead, it announced the cancellation of May Day and moving the
holiday to May 8.
Unlike other parts of the UK, the May 1 bank holiday is fixed by
statute for Scotland. Employers have the power to grant VE Day in
addition to May 1, and most have.

THE SNP's Perth and Kinross by-election candidate, Mrs Roseanna
Cunningham, yesterday backed plans for a national minimum wage.
She said that no-one in Scotland should earn less than #4 an hour.
''Our ambition for Scotland is for a high-wage, high-skilled and
highly-competitive economy. A national minimum wage is an important part
of that ambition,'' she told an SNP fringe meeting at the STUC.
She also took a swipe at the Labour Party, stating that it was
impossible to have a debate about the national minimum wage without
putting a figure on it.
She claimed this would strike a chord with many trade unionists who
are becoming impatient at Labour's delay in saying what minimum wage it
would introduce if it won the next election.

FOLKLORE and fairy tales, childhood fancies and mature whimsicality --
these are all essential parts of Jonathan Burnett's dance-theatre
material. At times it's as if he wants to remind us of the serious
values of playfulness, especially when the topic is tinged with tragedy
-- but then, all wise fools know that, and Burnett has a flair for
playing the clever jester.
Take, for instance, Alphabet Impromptu (one of his Trascendental
Studies). The joke here is like one of Escher's visual tricks -- quite
simply it depends on what you see first. It could be a man going through
a series of stretches and flexes -- arms arcing, body folding -- to a
set of Mozart variations. What Burnett himself describes as a
''choreographic compendium''.
Hold on though -- some of the shapes look strangely like . . . letters
of the alphabet! Which is what they are. If, however, you spot it
straight away that his limbs were spelling out A-Z, the joke lies in how
nicely the moves string together as a piece of abstract contemporary
dance of the kind particularly beloved by minimalists!
This programme of short works is full of sly humour but Burnett's
caprices have a romantic element too. His solo mime, Birthday of the
Infanta -- based on Oscar Wilde's fairy story -- portrays both the
swagger and the pathos of the infatuated dwarf who mistakes a princess's
cruel amusement for true love. Here, as elsewhere, the quirks of
imagination are underpinned by his dapper technique -- splendidly neat,
nimble footwork, versatile characterisation, an engaging jauntiness
undiminished by the sadly sparse audience on Wednesday night. The show
is repeated tonight with matinee and evening performances tomorrow.

Ramblin' Jack Elliot the stuff of legend. McLEAN talks the real man.
IWAS a wee boy when I first discovered country and western music:
guitars and such and fiddle-playing which wasn't Scottish traditional.
When I was a wee boy I heard it on Radio Home Service and there were the
Sons of the Pioneers, and Roy Rogers and Gene Autrey and Cowboy Copas.
There wasn't much C&amp;W about or blues or anything at all except dance
bands or jazz and the jazz was mainly danceband or popular music.
Nothing wrong with that save that the music of the next four decades was
rooted in what we weren't allowed to hear all those years: redneck
music.
The redneck music came from communities such as we lived in ourselves.
The difference was that in Scotland we were still going daft to Guy
Mitchell and his hoolie-hoolie hat. And back in the late fifties and
early sixties we had a folk revival. Most of it was nonsense of course.
But in the midst of all this sudden ethnicity came a wheen of real
folk-singers, from America. Some were for real.
It was a shock back in the late 1950s when Leadbelly strode across a
stage and betrayed the simple fact that, far from being clad in denim
dungarees, he wore a zoot suit and a tie which could have been designed
by Wassily Kandinsky. Huddie Ledbetter wasn't even illiterate: he could
speak enough to set European intellectuals on their heels.
But the lovely myth of American peasantry was too much for the folk
movement, especially in Europe. The fact that the entire folk movement
and their ''hootenannies'' were ersatz and the heroes were but reheated
coffee didn't matter much more than truth about the cowboy music I heard
on the wireless. For a start I was hearing more C&amp;W on Luxembourg, a
European-based station. And back then I heard a lot of Ramblin' Jack
Elliott.
He was on a bill in Glasgow with the late Alex Campbell. Alex wore a
denim workshirt and jeans and cowboy boots and his hair long, though
with a Presley quiff and a wee beard which would today be horribly
fashionable. He was known abroad as ''Le Cowboy Ecossais'', but Ramblin'
Jack Elliott was the real thing. He was a cowboy, boots and denims,
fringed jacket, curled hat and home-spun philosophy: we should have
known better.
In fact Ramblin' Jack's real name is Elliott Charles Adnopoz, and he
is no more cowboy than I am.
Jack Elliott sounded as if he had spent his entire life picking
cotton: in fact he was the son of a wealthy dentist in Flatbush, a
moderately well-off district of New York. At an early age he became
enamoured of cowboy singers and still a teenager he encountered a
dude-ranch cowboy called Todd Fletcher, who taught him guitar. Later
Elliott met Woody Guthrie and became a fine impersonator of the folk
legend. Woody once said of Jack that he ''sounds more like me than I
do''.
Elliott was to spend nearly six years in Europe, the first American
folk/western star to do so. When he returned to the States in the early
sixties he was a seasoned performer, and became one of the biggest
influences in the folk and later folk-rock boom. The grand old man he
remains.
Grand old Man? Hell, he is still here, still in the boots and Stetson.
Still topping the bill. He tops the Glasgow International Folk Festival.
There's a lot of major figures like Ravi Shankar of India and a
reconstituted Gallagher and Lyle of Scotland. The Clancy Brothers, after
all these years, are performing. Dave Allison is playing his impeccable
guitar. But top of the bill, top of the lot is 62-year-old Ramblin' Jack
Elliott.
When I spoke to him at his clapboard house in upstate New York (well
his clapboard telephone really) he had the same voice I heard back in
the 1950s. Very soft, rather middle-class really, a bit too nice for a
man who has seen a lot more than I want to know about -- and if you have
ever read a lie that is it. God knows how much I'd have liked to have
been Ramblin' Jack. Well a bit.
''I'm looking forward to Scotland, Jack, haven't been there in a long
while. This boy Charlie Harrigan, (the folk festival director) well, he
seems a nice chap . . . met him in the States, bought me a drink ot two,
nice chap.''
Chap? Very British word that. ''Yeah,'' he drawled. ''Probably is
British. But I like Britain. I know the difference though -- Scotland is
a different country. A bit like my own,'' he said.
I said Scotland was a bit like his own country too if we get it right.
International. What folk festivals are all about.

Top-name performers are lined up for the Glasgow International Folk
Festival in June. Rob Adams sets the scene.
PEOPLE with long memories are both the bane of Glasgow International
Folk Festival director Charlie Harrigan's life, and part of his target
audience. There are those who harp on about the festival's dark hours in
the past, but since 1990's unqualified disaster, the festival has moved
into a new regular home, the Tron Theatre, and into profit -- albeit in
a small way.
By some hard bargaining, Harrigan has been able to expand this year's
programme to run over 11 days (Friday, June 23 to Sunday, July 2), with
two performances nightly in the Tron and supplementary concerts in
Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
There will also be a free entry festival club in the Tron's Victorian
Bar, and the community education programme, always a popular and
rewarding feature during festival week, is already under way, with a
series of fiddle workshops in schools and community centres leading up
to a performance at the festival (June 27), to give participants
something tangible to work towards.
With local government reorganisation imminent, Harrigan's aim this
year is to say: here we are, doing a great job, how about giving us some
real financial support? ''I refuse to accept,'' he says, ''that the jazz
festival, which gets eight or 10 times the amount we get from the local
authorities, attracts eight or 10 times as many visitors to this city,
or that it's eight or 10 times better than us.''
Not that he is taking a pop at the jazz festival. Indeed, he sees the
two events as complementary. The folk festival's closing weekend
coincides with the jazz festival opening, and Harrigan and jazz festival
director Derek Gorman are working together on marketing ideas.
The complementary effort extends to their respective programmes. On
the night violinist Stephane Grappelli plays the Theatre Royal for
Gorman (July 2), Belgian gypsy jazz guitarist Fapy Lafertin, formerly of
the band Waso, plays at the Tron for Harrigan.
Co-operation aside, there are three main threads running through the
folk festival programme: the history of Glasgow's folk scene,
internationalism, and families. The first is aimed at people with long
memories of the positive variety. Like last year's guest Derrol Adams,
Ramblin' Jack Elliott (Strathclyde Suite, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall,
June 23) is one of the true characters from the folk singing boom of the
late 1950s and early 1960s.
Ramblin' Jack, a formidable guitar picker and a persuasive singer,
worked with Woody Guthrie, and legend has it that he taught Bob Dylan to
play the harmonica (although this is not a statement one would want to
make in front of a pantomime audience).
The historical theme continues with Ireland's Clancy Brothers
(Strathclyde Suite, June 30) and Davey Arthur (Tron, same evening),
Gallagher &amp; Lyle (Strathclyde Suite, July 2) and Messing About On The
River (June 29), Danny Kyle's multi-media tribute to the late Josh
McRae, Glasgow's answer to Woody Guthrie. With Turning of the Century
(June 27) singer Arthur Johnstone celebrates industrial Glasgow from
John McLean to more recent times.
International attractions include Indian sitar master Ravi Shankar
(Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, July 2), the return of Flamenco ensemble
Jaleo (June 23), Donskaja Volnitea from Russia, and electric folk from
France's Le Gop (both June28).
Father and son acts, guitar legend Wizz Jones and saxophonist Simeon,
and classy singer/songwriter Allan Taylor and pianist Barnaby (June 26),
emphasise the family aspect, and as both sons are promising jazz
players, Harrigan sees another potential link with the jazz festival in
a post-concert jam session.
Scottish interests are well served by harpist/composer William Jackson
and Aberdeen's Old Blind Dogs (June 24); the youthful Tannas (June 29)
and the more experienced but lesser spotted Tannahill Weavers (July 1);
and a new band led by the brilliant guitarist Tony McManus and featuring
piper Fred Morrison.
Echoing his jazz counterpart's ''festival with something for
everyone'' message, Harrigan has two performances by Opera on a
Shoestring (June 25 and 26), two excellent groups to open and close the
festival -- Ireland's hard-driving Afterhours and Scotland's more
refined Smalltalk -- and a performer who can have you shaking with
laughter one minute and shaking in your shoes the next, England's Vin
Garbutt (June 25).
* Full programme details will appear in the festival tabloid, issued
free with The Herald on May 18.

THIS early play by Albert Camus, the French novelist, philosopher, and
resistance fighter, is like Arsenic and Old Lace without the laughs.
It is revived by Brushed Nylon Theatre, a young Edinburgh company
committed to performing work that is ''absurd, unsettling, or
innovative''. Seeing as it made its debut with Ionesco's The Bald Prima
Donna last year, I guess this must be the unsettling one.
Certainly it's a curious piece. A mother and daughter running a remote
boarding house have got into the habit of murdering their more wealthy
guests, pinching their money and dropping them in the river. When a long
lost son checks in unrecognised, the same thing happens to him.
It's possible you could build a well-paced thriller on top of this
idea, but Camus puts all his cards on the table pretty much from the
start, making the play more of a nihilistic wallow in despair than the
modern tragedy he intended.
And for much of Brushed Nylon's production, performed on a
good-looking naturalistic set designed by Peter Reid with a subtle
lighting and sound design by Rob Harris, it seems that Camus's
depressing vision has sucked the life out of the performance itself. The
speeches drone on with little development and much repetition, leaving
the actors seemingly powerless to prevent the mood of bad-tempered
dourness engulfing us all.
Eventually Norah Elwell-Sutton, playing Martha, the murderous
daughter, manages to break through with some impassioned acting, but it
comes as too late an indication that the company might really have
understood what the play was all about, leaving us neither moved by the
tragedy nor engaged in the philosophical debate.

THOSE of us familiar with the young company Opera on a Shoestring were
probably surprised last night when the group appeared at the Eastwood
Festival with reduced forces -- only a vocal quartet and pianist Julia
Lynch. The reason was that the rest of the team was in rehearsal with
Scottish Opera for a forthcoming production.
It did mean a big pressure on the group -- they were all singing
almost all the time, with a wee bit strain showing eventually in some of
the voices.
But it did mean that tenor Allan Adams got his hands on almost all of
the drink that seems to be an integral part of such a show, as well as
getting to do most of the compering -- brilliantly foiled by bass Graeme
Danby's earthy Tyneside humour, which had the audience (well, this
member anyway) in stitches.
And the quartet -- including Gillian Taylor (soprano) and Theresa
Goble (alto) -- put on a show jam-packed with entertaining operatic
excerpts. Well-staged and with subtle variations in lighting, this was a
real value-for-money show. Opening and closing with ensemble sections
from Die Fledermaus, the programme brimmed with choice cuts: from La
Traviata (a taster for their forthcoming Mayfest production), a gorgeous
Offenbach Barcarolle, a huge section from L'Elisir d'Amore -- in which
the effervescent collective personality of the group bubbled over --
extracts from Cosi and Magic Flute (Graeme Danby and his throttled
chickens) and a beautiful selection from The Merry Widow.
The four singers worked like Trojans, and the effort was worth it. The
pianist must have blistered fingers.
This is a compact company with tons of confidence, style, and panache.
They go from strength to strength.

WITH an Arctic blast and April snow showers to oblige, a Scots
energy-efficiency firm is launching a revolutionary electric heater that
won't burn a hole in the pocket. Typically, seven hours' continuous heat
costs just 20p. GlowZone has two radiant panels, hinged to shield and
enclose the user in a comfort zone -- ''like sitting in the sun on a
pleasant summer's day'', say Solas Insulation, of Dumbarton.
It's being aimed at pensioners, the infirm and people working from
home who need to keep a weather eye on their heating bills.
GlowZone costs #175 (delivered) but the makers say the radiant
elements last a lifetime, and it will immediately start paying for
itself in lower running costs. For information call the 24-hour hotline
-- 0800 374 483.
* HOW we won the war (continued). Yet more nostalgia is unleashed on a
bemused public in the run-up to VE-Day: Whittard, the Chelsea tea
specialists, launch a celebration tea to recapture the ''strong,
refreshing flavour'' of the Naafi char downed by millions of
ex-Servicemen and women.
Available from stockists at #2.99 a pack, or order on 0171-924 1888.
For a truly authentic touch, try it ''Sergeant Major'' style with the
teaspoon standing to attention in a sediment of sugar. Ideal for washing
down Safeway's Victory fruitcake, made with tea-soaked dried fruit (wot,
no eggs?) despite a frugal Ministry of Food provenance, the makers
promise it's delicious. At 95p, the cake comes in a cardboard box with a
raw potato and carrot sponge recipe and the slogan ''We'll Eat Again.''
* RE-VISTING the more recent past at Carlisle's Tullie House Museum
recalls flares, the Ford Capri, Harold Wilson, hot pants, punk,
platforms, Rubik's Cube, The Wombles, and Watergate. The Seventies
Revisited exhibition runs until May 8, but there's a free open day
tomorrow between 10am and 4pm with the chance to be photographed in
seventies' gear and has a Ziggy Stardust make-over. As long as they're

<HEADLINE>Congress told of leaked Government letters and horrific attack on union leader's wife    Criminal injuries cash could be cut</HEADLINE>

<FLAG>STUC ANNUAL CONGRESS</FLAG>

<TEXT>
TWO leaked Government letters show that the Scottish Secretary Ian
Lang is attempting to cut criminal injuries compensation by #1m a month,
it was claimed at the STUC annual congress in Perth yesterday.
Mr Michael McCann, Scottish Secretary of the Civil and Public Services
Association, said it was an absolute outrage that Mr Lang was more
interested in saving money than in the victims of crime.
''You should have defended the people of Scotland, not conspired to
swindle them out of their legal rights,'' he said.
One letter purports to be a record of a meeting involving, amongst
others, the Home Secretary, the Lord President, and the Scots Secretary,
in March. It was a discussion over what should be the next step when the
House of Lords upheld the Court of Appeal's decision to declare the Home
Secretary's new reduced scheme of criminal injuries compensation as
illegal.
It states that, if action was not taken, the ''previous, more generous
scheme'' would cost an extra #9m a month in England and Wales and #1m a
month in Scotland.
The meeting discussed the possibility of bringing in a Bill to correct
the position. The confidential letter allegedly states: ''The Secretary
of State for Scotland said that he supported the case which the Home
Secretary had made. The financial implications of not legislating if the
Lords found against the Government were very serious.''
A second letter to the Prime Minister from Mr Tony Newton, the Leader
of the House, allegedly mentions a further meeting involving Mr Lang and
Home Secretary Michael Howard about legislation to curb the compensation
scheme.
Mr McCann stated that the cheaper scheme would mean that there would
be little distinction between a victim of rape and someone with a broken
kneecap.
Delegates debating the plans to change the compensation scheme were
shocked yesterday by the harrowing story of a union leader's wife who
was dragged from her car and beaten up by two men.
Mr Ronnie Scott, president of the Fire Brigades Union, described to
the conference the attack in Paisley which changed the lives of himself
and his wife Ann.
Mrs Scott was driving home from work when the masked men appeared from
nowhere, dragged her by the hair out of the car, tearing her scalp in
the process, and proceeded to ''batter her black and blue''. They stole
her car and even tried to reverse over her, but she managed to roll away
despite her appalling injuries.
He said there was a man's footprint etched on her torn clothes, which
showed they had callously stamped on her as she lay dazed and bleeding
on the ground.
He explained that Mrs Scott was unable to return to work for six
months as she recovered. Eventually she had to take a job on a lower
salary. At the same time she changed from an outgoing fun-loving person
to an introvert who mistrusted every stranger.
Eventually, she was awarded criminal injuries compensation which
allowed them to carry on with their lives despite her reduced earnings.
Under the Government's new plans, he said, she would have been awarded
thousands of pounds less, and he did not know what they would have done.
Delegates voted unanimously to call on the Home Secretary to scrap the
new scheme entirely, and condemned any Government attempts to introduce
emergency legislation to overcome the House of Lords judgment.

Drummond Castle, near Crieff: reminiscent of Versailles, with huge
formal gardens -- laid out round a giant saltire defined in white
flowers.
Scottish Tourism Oscars: the decisions will be yours. Lesley Duncan
selects her own favourites to inspire a celebration of Scotland's
attractions
NO more hibernating -- at least till next winter. The whin is in
bloom. Blackbirds are singing. Hedges are green. Time to take to the
open road again (though not, of course, to display Toad of Toad Hall
tendencies behind the wheel of the car). Time, too, to start the search
for winners of this year's Scottish Tourism Oscars.
Each spring The Herald -- in conjunction with the Scottish Tourist
Board, Grampian Television and Caithness Glass -- seeks readers' help in
identifying the most worthy recipients of the annual ''Oscars'' for
Scotland's outstanding tourist attractions.
There are five prize-winning categories. Oscars will be awarded to the
best town and the best village, and in the general category of best
tourist attraction. Oscars are also being awarded this year in two new
categories -- ''on the water'' and ''glorious garden''.
Readers' local knowledge and expertise will be of crucial help (see
the coupon below). The main problem will surely be an embarrassment of
possibilities.
Take the general category. Already this spring has seen the reopening
to the public of a refurbished Holyroodhouse. Instead of approaching the
palace by side gates, visitors are now treated to the impressive frontal
view of Scotland's working royal residence. Like any visiting notables,
they can climb the great stair, admiring the restored frescoes as their
feet sink into luxurious blue carpeting.
Inside the throne room, no more corralling of the plebs in a narrow
cordoned-off walkway under the windows. The new red carpet (Stoddard
Templeton's finest) has been rolled out for the public to walk on. There
are endless artefacts, pictures and tapestries to admire in the state
salons.
Most interest is bound to focus, however, on the renovated rooms
associated with Mary Queen of Scots in the original James V tower.
Mementoes of Mary and later Stuarts have been returned to their natural
home from Windsor. A four-language guide (including Japanese) underlines
the perennial fascination of the Stuart queen and her melodramatic life.
Holyrood's gardens are opened to the public too. Their eight acres,
bounded by a haha, may not offer an overwhelming aesthetic experience.
But how pleasant to wander on paths once the preserve of royals and
moderators and their entourages.
The views of Arthur's Seat and the Salisbury Crags beyond the ruined
abbey are among Edinburgh's finest. A well-stocked shop in the palace
mews and seats in the concourse also reflect the visitor-friendliness of
the new regime.
Up north on the Moray Firth, a most ambitious project is nearing
completion. From next Wednesday, the public will have a chance to see
the transformation wrought in the William Adam mansion of Duff House,
Banff. This great eighteenth-century building, which would sit happily
in a French or Tuscan landscape, has been brought back to glorious life
by the combined efforts of Historic Scotland, the local authorities and
the National Galleries of Scotland.
Beautifully renovated internally, and stuffed with period furniture
and artefacts, it will serve as an outstation of the national galleries
-- a role already pioneered by Paxton House near Berwick.
Among the many delightful pictures on show in this sympathetic setting
are clutches of Ramsays and Raeburns and a St Jerome by El Greco. Public
use of the building is being encouraged in all sorts of imaginative
ways. An education suite, a restaurant, and a well-stocked shop (no
melamine table mats, vows the manager) are sure to draw interest from
far beyond the local hinterland.
The never-failing fascination of steam engines brings visitors of all
ages to the Bo'ness and Kinneil Railway, West Lothian. Small boys are
initiated in the intricacies of steam traction by dads and grand-dads.
Actual engines can be touched and wondered at. Steam-hauled hurls can be
taken through woodlands lush with bluebells in May. A fire-clay mine can
be visited.
These are only a few random suggestions for the general-attraction
Oscar. Your ideas will be welcome. But please don't say the Forth Rail
Bridge before it falls down! The Loch Ness monster wins outright if it
puts in an appearance outwith the silly season.
This could be Stirling's year for winning the Scottish town Oscar. It
has so much to engage the imagination of Scots as well as foreign
visitors. And it's looking its best these days with the spine of the old
town and castle silhouetted against the Perthshire mountains (still
positively alpine under late snows).
Think nationalistic thoughts at Bannockburn under the eyes of
Pilkington Jackson's great equestrian statue of Bruce. See the
continuing renovation of the castle's great hall and ponder Scotland's
past glories. Climb the Wallace Monument and view the huge sword the
patriot wielded (how will Mel Gibson play this giant of Scotland's past
in his forthcoming film?).
Other towns may not have the same concentration of history but have
their own attractions for tourists. Let us know your choice.
Villages also seek advocates. For a miniature hamlet of Cotswold
perfection, rose-girt Straiton, in South Ayrshire, takes some beating in
high summer. New Lanark is a monument to the enlightened
industrialisation of the past and enlightened renovation of the present.
And its proximity to the Falls of Clyde could also put it in the running
for the ''on the water'' award.
This new award has been deliberately worded to encompass a wide range
of possibilities. It might be given, for example, to the paddle steamer
Waverley, which still churns its way up and down the Firth of Clyde (and
further afield) -- a functioning reminder of the great days of coastal
cruising and the whole shipbuilding heritage of Clydeside.
The Waverley's inland-loch relative, The Sir Walter Scott, likewise
charms endless posses of foreigners and Scots as it plies Loch Katrine,
under the Trossachs heights of Ben Venue and Ben An.
Plockton might claim the ''on the watter'' award for its sheer
picturesqueness, not to mention its televisual role. You may know of an
unsung riverfront or waterfront which has been improved and prettified.
Again, ''on the watter'' could refer to some waterbound activity, such
as waterskiing or snorkelling.
The final Oscar category ''glorious garden'' reflects the number of
beautiful gardens -- whether in private or public hands -- open to the
public in Scotland. The choice is endless. You may opt for the opulent
terraced gardens at Culzean Castle and Country Park, with their palm
trees, orangerie, and views from the castle battlements of turquoise
waters lapping the cliff-foot.
The rhododendrons of Brodick Castle in the lee of Goatfell, or Crarae
on Loch Fyne, may have your vote. The rose and viola gardens beside the
River Ayr at Craigie Park are one of Ayr's pleasantest assets.
Or what about the astonishing gardens at Drummond Castle, near Crieff?
Reminiscent of Versailles, these huge formal gardens -- laid out round a
giant saltire defined in white flowers -- offer endless prospects of
rose beds and clipped shrubs, set among grottoes where white marble gods
and goddesses lurk and fountains plash. Look out for the peacocks. This
is gardening on a heroic scale. Incidentally, the castle is featured in
the new Hollywood epic Rob Roy.
The physic garden being imaginatively created round Glasgow's oldest
house, Provand's Lordship, is sure to draw many visitors already
attracted to the museum of religion and Glasgow Cathedral nearby.
These are just some initial suggestions. Over to you, the public.
Oscar and out!

Conference report
from KEN SMITH
A SCOTTISH parliament could end up with 145 MPs, as part of the latest
proposal being put forward to try to win the support of both the Labour
and Liberal Democrat parties.
Timing is now becoming acute, as the Lib Dems want some kind of
proposals to put before their conference a week tomorrow.
Labour leaders in Scotland will discuss the suggestion tomorrow. The
Labour Party is keen that its Scottish parliament scheme should have the
support of at least one other political party, in order to give it more
credence.
The latest suggestion is that there would be 73 constituencies -- the
present 72, with Shetland and Orkney split into two -- plus a further 70
members used to reflect the proportion of votes for each party as well
as making the number of male and female MPs as equal as possible.
The compromise, if accepted, will disappoint leaders of the STUC, who
have been backing a far larger Scottish parliament of 214 members.
It will also mean that the STUC's radical proposal that people elect
two MPs from every constituency -- one male, one female -- would be
ditched.
Supporters of the compromise say that the smaller number would,
nonetheless, be able to achieve gender equality.
Delegates at the STUC in Perth yesterday warned that there was no room
for complacency in the fight to achieve a parliament of equal
representation for women.
Ms Carol Peggie, vice-president of Unison, said: ''It took much time
and a lot of effort by many of us in this hall to win the debate about
ensuring fair representation for women in a future Scottish parliament.
Yet it has taken very little time for our policy to be put in jeopardy.
''Our proposal for ensuring equal representation was one of the most
radical taken into the last General Election campaign. And we must fight
to protect it as we go into the next.''
The STUC also fears that, if a Scottish parliament is set up by a
future Labour Party without equal numbers for women from the start, then
it will be very difficult to achieve in the future.
As STUC general secretary Campbell Christie pointed out: ''In five
years' time some of the bums on seats will be stuck to these seats and
will not be keen to be removed from these seats.''

At a special lectern because she could not get her wheelchair to the
normal one yesterday, and assisted by a translator for the deaf, teacher
Anne Begg of the EIS told the debate on disabilities of the problem she
faced when she arrived to vote for Labour in the recent elections. She
told congress that her polling station had steps which she could not
negotiate, and, despite wearing a red rosette, Tory supporters carried
her into the polling station. ''But never worry, for the sake of
political balance, I got the SNP to carry me out again,'' she explained.
On a more serious note, after Ms Begg had told delegates that the
present Government had refused to give disabled people rights which
would go some way in saving them from such indignities, congress backed
the motion, from her union, calling for legislation to stop
discrimination against disabled people.

Larnaca, Thursday
THREE British soldiers accused of killing a Danish woman in Cyprus
have been rowing and fighting in prison, and one is now to contest his
case alone in the latest twist to a legal drama that has dragged on
since September.
After a string of delays the whole trial is now due to start again
next month.
''I have nothing at all to do with the other two and I'm going to be
going the case alone,'' said 27-year-old Private Justin Fowler from
Falmouth, Cornwall.
''Distancing myself from the others may help my case,'' he added
during a break today in the latest court hearing in Larnaca.
The three men, who are charged with manslaughter, have yet to enter
pleas even though today saw their eighteenth appearance in court since
they were arrested on September 13.
They are accused of killing 23-year-old Danish tour guide Louise
Jensen after kidnapping her in the tourist resort of Ayia Napa.
Fowler said he had been moved from the top security wing of Nicosia's
Central Prison to a different cell. All three men have been held in the
prison since their arrest.
He said he had asked to be moved ''because we're not getting on''.
A prison guard said the three had been separated because Fowler and
Private Alan Ford, 26, from Birmingham, had been fighting.
Fowler sat apart from the other two today without saying anything
while they were held in a waiting room before entering the court.
Ford and the third accused soldier, Jeff Pernell, 23, from Oldbury,
West Midlands, chatted to each other, ignoring Fowler completely. In
previous court appearances all three appeared to be on good terms.
The trial has been delayed by a defence move for the men to be freed
on a legal technicality which has been referred to the Cyprus Supreme
Court.
Lawyers for Ford and Pernell argue that prison warders violated their
rights by confiscating notes the men wrote after they were detained and
that the case should be dismissed.
All three are members of the Royal Green Jackets regiment stationed at
the sovereign British base at Dhekelia, near Ayia Napa.
Today they appeared before a new three-member court, which ruled it
will start hearing the case all over again on May 15.
Police say the soldiers were arrested at a roadblock with bloodstains
on their clothes and a blood-covered shovel in their car a few hours
after Jensen's Cypriot boyfriend reported the kidnapping.
Her battered body was found in a shallow grave two days later.--AP.

Fanny to Floyd: Catherine Brown discusses the diverse personalities
who, over the years, have whetted the nation's appetite from the
television screen.
THOUGH Fanny Cradock became the most celebrated, Philip Harben was the
first of the TV cooks. An earnest, tubby, bearded little man who
appeared in a butcher's apron cooking and lecturing on the scientific
whys and wherefores of cooking.
He made his first filmed dish (a kipper omelette made with dried eggs)
in 1946. But it was during the fifties and sixties that millions
followed his programmes, learning the basics of his unfussy cooking
style which concentrated on teaching simple things like boiling eggs and
grilling steaks. In his 1960s series The Grammar of Cookery, the first
programme was on ''How heat is applied''.
Harben used his acting skills to put zest and urgency into cooking,
the gosh-factor playing a large part in the drama. He was also a
maverick who liked to tease professional chefs with the fact that he had
never had a cookery lesson in his life.
He scorned the use of ''correct'' names or ''classic'' garnishes,
seeing cooking as a living art form which should not be confined by
pretentious presentations.
He was the people's cook, a gifted amateur who had worked it out for
himself and he waged a long-running, and entertaining battle in the
media against the pompous element in the cooking world.
Fanny, on the other hand, liked to play out her storms and tantrums
during the programme. Johnny, her husband-in-evening-dress, was the
victim. Harangued by her grating voice and bossy style, he suffered in
silence and the viewers loved him for it. The sub-text which went on
between them was almost as important as the cooking, and yet Fanny came
to be regarded as the most trustworthy cooking teacher.
It had taken them almost 12 years to get on TV. During live
demonstrations which they gave, Fanny cooked and talked (often half in
French) too fast. She also did not like being ordered about by cameramen
and refused to follow the rules about holding dishes and pots at the
right angles for the camera.
The idea for their cooking programmes came when Fanny put an extra
''test'' cooker in their dining-room because there was no room for it in
the kitchen. Fanny -- being Fanny -- decided to make use of it by doing
a lot of last-minute cooking when they had guests for dinner.
On one occasion a film producer was among the guests, and as usual
Fanny was cooking in a smart cocktail dress without an apron. Why not
put her in a Hartnell evening gown and her husband in a dinner suit?
With one or two exceptions, the style of TV cooks since has followed
either the Harben or the Cradock formats: gifted educator or outrageous
entertainer.
Zena Skinner in the 60s was the first woman to take the motherly style
with her You're Never Too Late To Learn teaching plain food to old-age
pensioners. By the seventies her approach was seen as old-fashioned and
dull, though Marguerite Patten never went out of fashion despite her
mum-in-the-kitchen act.
While Skinner was first and foremost a cook, Patten also had a
theatrical angle. When she turned up for a guest slot on a cooking
programme I was presenting in the eighties she spent as long dressing
herself for the act as she spent getting her food organised. Shades of
Fanny, but without the tantrums.
There were also shades of Fanny in Australian Grahame Kerr's Galloping
Gourmet series, though he was never rude to anyone. Neither was Robert
Carrier in Wine, Food and Friends nor Michael Smith on Pebble Mill at
One, though these three men all went for sophisticated, elaborate food
based largely on the kind of rich sauces and elaborate garnishing of
French haute cuisine which Fanny loved.
Smith also had a feeling for the great traditional British dishes
which appeared to be going out of fashion. A cause taken up by Delia
Smith and the motherly Grace Mulligan in the Yorkshire Farmhouse Kitchen
series. The power of their attraction was as trustworthy educators,
their programmes were livened up by the content rather than by their
ability as entertainers.
Hitting this scene in the early eighties was Keith Floyd, first and
foremost an entertainer like Fanny who, for want of a compliant spouse,
was rude to the cameramen or the director.
He was also, like Fanny, spotted by a film producer while in action in
one of his restaurants. He started out with Floyd on Fish, encouraging
the more adventurous use of native fish in simpler rather than more
complicated dishes.
Taking up this cooking style, but dispensing with the TV cooking
personality, are new programmes such as Get Stuffed and Ready Steady
Cook where speed, zest, and simple cooking are the thing. Over 500
three-minute programmes of Get Stuffed have been filmed with groups of
young people starting in the shop, buying their ingredients, and then
rushing home to cook at speed. The camera catches the fun and enthusiasm

Supermarket shoppers may soon be responsible for totalling their own
bills.
TECHNOPHOBES beware -- if a trial in a Safeway in Solihull, England is
successful it looks as though you will have to adjust to yet another
piece of technology: hand-held scanners. The system involves supermarket
customers using a hand-held device with a laser beam which can read the
bar code and price of every purchase. According to Safeway spokesperson
Wendy Gerbert it is simple to use.
''The device is clipped on to a specially designed trolley. You run it
over the bar code of each item and it will actually come up on the
little computer screen, the price and what it is. You press the plus
button and it adds it up, then you can put it back in its holder and it
will print out the total.''
Customers will be able to keep a running tally of how much they are
spending, and the scanner can delete a product if the customer decides
to put it back on the shelf. The idea, says Gerbert, is to make shopping
more efficient, eliminating time wasted in long supermarket queues.
''Obviously it will make everything much quicker for the customer,''
she says.
With so much time saved, this seems likely to have an impact on
Safeway staff. While they will still be needed for customers to pay at
special ''express'' checkouts and to advise people on how to use the
scanners, the customer will be doing more of the work. So will this mean
less work for staff, and ultimately fewer jobs?
''No, we don't think so,'' says Gerbert. ''It's not a money-saver,
that's not the object. The object is hassle-free shopping for
customers.''
Patrick Kiernan, Safeway's managing director, was equally firm: ''This
is not a cost-cutting exercise. In fact, we foresee that contact between
our staff and customers will increase as more will be able to help and
advise customers.''
And then there's a more delicate issue, the possibility of customers
abusing their new responsibility. As shoppers trundle around with their
trolleys, dutifully scaning brocoli and canned tuna, will there be the
temptation to allow a bottle of wine to slip into the trolley unnoticed?
Perhaps, but like trying to avoid buying a train ticket, it wouldn't be
easy to carry out.
''The first time you use it, it will all be checked at the till,''
says Gerbert. ''After that there will be random spot checks. The better
you get at using it, then points will apply to your loyalty card.''
The loyalty card, also known as the ABC customer-reward card, is the
other way Safeway will keep track of self-scanner users. Shoppers are to
register by signing up for the card, which records personal details like
address and telephone number, and each time they come to the supermarket
they must swipe in a dispenser system which unlocks the scanner. It will
also allow Safeway to see what shoppers buy, so those products can be
the subjects of promotions and special offers.
Shoppers at the Byres Road Safeway in Glasgow were ambivalent about
the scheme. Most thought the potential efficiency of the system was
good, but some people had reservations. One woman pointed out that it
might be difficult trying to keep track of scanning items while also
keeping an eye on her two young children. Another felt it would be
awkward to keep deleting products on the scanner if she changed her mind
about purchases.
David Simonsen, while acknowledging that the system would be a
timesaver, isn't enthusiastic: ''I think it's ridiculous,'' he says.
''It's another stop towards impersonal transactions, like auto-tellers.
It's a foot in the door for the replacement of checkout staff by
technology. If this trend continues we won't have to talk to anyone or
see anyone when we do our shopping.''
Graham Gordon, another Safeway shoper, is much more positive. ''I
think it sounds like a really good idea,'' he says. ''The only worry
would be if people could somehow get around it, but I don't think they
could because you still have to go through the till.''
So when can we expect self-scanners in our local supermarket?
Nothing's definite at this early stage, according to Gerbert.
''It all depends on the trial. That will go on in Solihull until the
end of this year, so we won't know until after that.''

Washington,
OKLAHOMA is just about as Middle-American as it is possible to get.
People living on the great plains that sweep north from Mexico to Canada
know little of the wide world across the oceans and still less of the
murderous conflicts that agitate less happy lands.
New York was shocked profoundly by the bombing of the World Trade
Center two years ago, but that is a great and cosmopolitan city and is
constantly disturbed by echoes of distant disputes.
Oklahoma City is solely concerned with American affairs -- like Little
Rock, Arkansas, to the east, Kansas to the north or the Rocky Mountain
states to the west.
Now they have all learnt once again the old lesson that no man is an
island entire of itself. It is very painful.
Every comment by the people there, picked up by reporters or gathered
on the radio, is a variation on the theme: ''Why did it happen here? If
it could happen here, then nowhere is safe.''
True enough. There are scores of towns just like Oklahoma City, and
there must be hundreds of office buildings like the one blown to pieces
on Wednesday -- and thousands of smaller ones.
Oklahoma City is out on the prairies. The land is flat and monotonous
for hundreds of miles in every direction: the most striking feature is
often the oil pumps, like huge birds, endlessly bowing and rising every
few hundred yards. The Murrah Building, nine stories high, passes for a
skyscraper. Land is cheap in Oklahoma, so there is no need for high
buildings. The town spreads unconstrained.
Oklahoma is no longer a cowboy state, or even primarily a farm state
or an oil state. Hi-tech industries have arrived, there are many
military bases and installations, including nuclear facilities. But its
governing ethos remains small-town America, which is why the bombing has
hit it so hard.
The governor of the state, Frank Keating, was once a policeman. He
said last night that some of his former colleagues and close friends
were among the missing, people working in the various government
offices. The same observation applies to thousands of other people in
Oklahoma.
This was the sort of government building that everyone visits at one
time or another, so everyone in the town feels personally affected. The
most extreme feelings, of course, come from the fact that so many small
children were killed in the day care centre in the Murrah building, and
many others injured in the YMCA building across the street.
People were stunned to begin with, but as the enormity of the crime
sinks in, as there are more pictures of dead babies and grieving
parents, there will be enormous anger. Middle-America may be isolated
from the world and preoccupied with its own concerns, but its people
also believe in summary justice (Oklahomans all staunchly oppose every
measure of gun control) and will demand vengeance.
For the moment, though, the city has shut down. People are told to
keep away from the site of the disaster, and offices, shops and eating
places are all closed. People stay at home and watch television, which
plays the horrifying scenes from Wednesday over and over again.
It is much too early to draw any large conclusions from the event.
People from Belfast or London could tell Oklahomans that they will very
quickly get used to a very different sort of normality. But it does seem
fair to say, already, that a sort of American innocence has been
shattered.
It can happen here, it has.
*The victims of the Oklahoma bomb blast are likely to be more
traumatised than people in areas that have more experience of terrorism,
a psychologist said yesterday.
''The experience is totally new and unexpected for them,'' said Dr
Douglas Duckworth, a chartered pyschologist in Leeds.
''While people who may be victims of a terrorist act in, say London,
might still have thought it could never happen to them, in Oklahoma
there is no experience of it all. I think it will hit them much
harder.''
Dr Duckworth said emergency workers, who may be used to seeing the
carnage of road traffic accidents, would not be psychologically prepared
for the scale of the bombing.
''I would imagine that their contingency plans for disaster are not
very well-developed,'' he said.
''The effects can be pretty devastating, even in the long term. People
who have been caught unawares have been very seriously shocked.''

I'VE learned one thing from BBC Radio Scotland's Thought for the Day
over the years. What you least want to talk about is often what you
ought to talk about.
On Wednesday afternoon, when I was preparing a script, reflection had
brought me round to the notion that, on a thin day, I'd better say
something about a New York court's $19m award to a widow of the
Lockerbie bombing. There was a lesson, I thought, in the way wrangles
and recriminations drag on and conspiracy theories thrive. When the law
is frustrated in judging those who stand accused, we are tempted to seek
scapegoats.
I was therefore thinking about the long aftermath of one crime when
the news came of another and rewrote the script. What hit Oklahoma City
in the aftermath of Easter had only too many echoes of that awful
prelude to a Scottish Christmas. The suddenness, the wantonness, and (so
it seems as I write) the scale of massacre, all remind us only too much
of Lockerbie.
It is too early to speculate on how far there's a common factor in the
motives for the two monstrous crimes. The dark satantic forces of
terrorism -- I have to use words out of fashion in our pulpits -- wear
various colours and merge from different cultures of political or
pseudo-religious fanaticism.
The Oklahoma massacre pushed down the news running-order another
apparent gas attack on Japanese subway passengers. Further down, and
almost squeezed out, was a variation in Spain of the kind of political
terrorism we in the British Isles know only too well. Now an American
voice on my radio is reviving the idea of the Waco connection.
But we may find two common factors when we reflect on the implications
of the two crimes, one so unforgettably close to us and the other in
what seemed the peaceful heart of America.
First, there is a point about terrorist tactics too easily missed.
It's often missed in Britain even after our long recent experience of
terrorism and our partial success in standing up to it. It is not
unlikely to be instantly understood in the United States, which for all
its experience of violent crime, was, until recently, all but unscathed
by terrorism at home and is understandably naive about it.
Those who use terrorist tactics, and that means also their political
front-men and fellow-travellers, do not only measure their impact in
death, destruction, and the economic cost of security measures. Part of
their success lies in the bitterness which they cause, in the tensions
they create over security measures and civil liberties, and in the
recriminations -- sometimes legal, more often political -- which they
provoke among those they hurt.
Secondly, the fanatics hope that by testing the vulnerability of any
political system, or even a civilisation, they may terrify or weary it
into giving way, either by surrender on one point or by a social and
moral collapse. In Irish or Spanish or even some Middle Eastern cases
the goal may be relatively limited: an objective unattainable by orderly
political process and consent. Even this poltiical terrorism overlaps
with the fanaticism possessed by an evil spirit of chaos.
But how do we respond? We have to blend tactics and approaches which
don't go easily together. I see that on Thought for the Day I managed to
be Christian enough to say: ''We have to pray for those consumed by
hatred and madness as well as for their victims who bear the pain and
grief.'' I should have said we must love our enemies and do good to
those who hate us, but I couldn't summon up the sincerity to say so.
The most difficult thing (as we learned against the IRA) is to respond
effectively without even the slightest taint of the callous and violent
hatreds against which we must defend ourselves. We have to keep our
ideals and freedoms without becoming a soft touch.
We have to show that the apparent vulnerability of Western
civilisation to terror is deceptive. In face of new fanaticisms and
terrorist tactics the West has to achieve what, after a fashion, it did
in face of Hitler and Lenin's heir, Stalin. We have to discover for
ourselves and we then demonstrate to others that underneath its
softness, cynicism, and selfishness our civilisation is resilient,
adaptable, and capable both of moral and practical self-defence.

IT WAS supposed to happen in Belfast, Bosnia, Beirut, even London, but
not Oklahoma City, not anytown USA.
Twenty-four hours after the Alfred Murrah Federal Building
disintegrated under the force of a 1000lb car bomb, Americans were
waking to the realisation that they are no longer immune to terrorism in
their own backyard. The shock and disbelief so publicly displayed by
President Clinton and other senior government officials was being
replayed in countless homes and offices across the country.
Even the bombers who targeted the World Trade Center in New York two
years ago seemed largely unreal to many US citizens. Memories of that
blast have faded to grainy TV pictures of disorientated office workers,
sooty with smoke but not too visibly bloodied.
New York was an obvious target and so, too, is Oklahoma if you look at
a map. It's in the very heart of America, a home-grown, picket-fence
kind of place startling in its ordinariness. God's country. If we can
hit you here, the bombers were saying, we can hit you anywhere. It's a
message which has been picked up in cities across the nation.
Dallas is three hours drive south of Oklahoma City and is where three
possible suspects -- two said to be of Middle-Eastern appearance --
hired a brown pick-up truck. The Dallas Morning News carried a large
front-page photograph of the ragged building and one word, ''Terror.''
The Daily Oklahoman's front page was filled with the words ''Bombing
Terror.''
The media, network and local, have continued to give wall-to-wall
coverage of the event. Many of the network operations who relied on
local affiliates in Oklahoma immediately after the bomb went off had
their own people on the ground by late on Wednesday.
At the USA Today offices in Arlington, Virginia, reporters, who
regularly test opinions across the country for what is really the only
national newspaper in the States, said they were overwhelmed at the
thought of how Americans felt the day after. Normal vox pop questions
ask about sending troops overseas, dealing with the budget deficit, tax
hikes, gun laws, the school system, not full-scale terrorist attacks in
the continental US.
''It's total, total shock,'' said Andrea Mays of USA Today's news
team. ''There's a definite sense of uncertainty in the US now, no matter
where you are. It's opened up the vulnerability. It's made everybody
feel a little bit more vulnerable to this sort of attack. It's totally,
totally shocking.''
At National Public Radio in Washington DC, spokesman John Verdi said
they had watched sniffer digs being brought in to the neighbouring
headquarters of the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms after the
blast. The ATF was one of the government departments with an office in
the Alfred Murrah Building.
''That put a little bit of the heebie jeebies on us,'' said
Verdi.''Personally I took a little wider path around the building.''
Verdi said, however, that the bombing was not completely dominating
conversations in the capital.''You don't hear people talking about it
too much. It's all over the papers but it's not coming up in
conversation all the time.''
In New York, the tabloid New York Daily Post filled the front page
with what is turning out to be the defining image of the tragedy -- a
picture of a fireman cradling a limp and bloodied child, with the
headline Evil Cowards. The New York Times, which normally presents a
sober, understated image to the world, devoted its entire front page to
the bombing with a large headline and the same photograph as the Daily
Post.
Talk radio stations were inundated with calls from people shortly
after the disaster on Wednesday. Most were trying to keep abreast of
developments or express their shock and puzzlement. Yesterday staff were
expecting the anger to start showing through with calls concentrating
not so much on the tragedy as those responsible for it.

Washington, Thursday
BABY foods contain more water, thickeners and sugar than many parents
may suspect, a new study said today.
An American nutrition group, known for analysing the fat and
cholesterol content of cinema popcorn, lunchtime sandwiches, and popular
ethnic foods, said that parents had to read baby food labels extremely
carefully.
Better yet, the Centre for Science in the Public Interest group said,
parents should take advantage of modern appliances like blenders and
food processors, or even an old fashioned fork, to prepare baby food
themselves.
The group also urged authorities to require clearer labels on baby
foods, so that consumers know how much ''real food'' and how many
fillers the jar contains.
In the report Cheating Babies: Nutritional Quality and Cost of
Commercial Baby Food, the nutritionists say that some of the foods for
children over six months old contain more than two-thirds of water and
starchy fillers.
What's worse, they cost more than similar products without the
fillers, CSPI said. Baby foods and juices generally cost more than the
adult equivalents, even when the foods are basically the same, like
fruit juices or apple sauce.
''Parents may feel that there may be something especially good about
baby foods that justifies high prices. There is nothing magical about
baby foods,'' the report said.
''When you want convenience, prepared adult foods that are similar in
consistency to baby foods ar just as good, but cost much less.''
The report was particularly critical of Gerber and Heinz brands. It
found Beech-Nut, Growing Healthy, and Earth's Best preferable, and urged
supermarkets to sell their own house brands without many
fillers.--Reuter.

PAUL TAYLOR in Paris, Thursday.
A FURORE over blame for destabilising the franc dominated final
exchanges before Sunday's first round of the French presidential
election, but seemed unlikely to dent Paris mayor Jacques Chirac's
prospects of winning.
Chirac accused fellow conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of
taking the franc hostage in the election campaign, after the premier
said his opponent should stop unsettling currency markets with
''zig-zag'' economic statements.
Between two bouts of invective, the two Gaullist rivals were briefly
united with outgoing Socialist President Francois Mitterrand at a
ceremony for the reburial of scientists Pierre and Marie Curie in the
Paris Pantheon of French national heroes.
Beneath the giant columns of the neo-classical former church, the
three men exchanged small-talk and greeted Polish President Lech Walesa
out of earshot of journalists.
The row between the two ex-allies has forced the franc down in the
last week of campaigning before Sunday's first ballot.
However the currency edged up slightly today and the Bank of France
indirectly rebutted Chirac's criticism of governor Jean-Claude Trichet's
call for wage restraint.
A rare statement by the bank's monetary policy council said it would
fulfil its legal duty to guarantee price and currency stability,
independent of party politics.
The dispute gave Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin, long sidelined by
the duel between the Gaullists, a chance to act the statesman, deploring
damage to France's international standing.
All nine first-round candidates competing for the votes of 39.9
million electors were holding their last big rallies tonight. The
campaign ends tomorrow at midnight.
The top two contenders to succeed Mitterrand, stepping down after two
seven-year terms, will meet in a run-off on May 7.
A black-out on opinion polls has been in force since last Sunday, when
the last surveys showed Chirac comfortably ahead with about 26% of the
vote, Jospin second on 20%, and Balladur sinking in third place with
about 16%.
Jospin made clear he expected to reach the second round and face
Chirac for what he has called ''the real debate''.
Balladur, fighting for a place in the run-off, told a meeting in
Lons-le-Saulnier, eastern France: ''The French people want change but
they don't want an upheaval.''
Five fringe candidates are expected to draw about 35% of the vote
among them.
In a reminder of the corruption scandals that have rocked French
politics in the past two years, former Trade Minister Michel Noir, mayor
of France's second city Lyon, was today given a 15-month suspended
prison sentence and disqualified from standing for public office for
five years.
Noir, a Balladur supporter who served in government under Chirac, was
convicted of accepting gifts and money embezzled by his son-in-law,
Pierre Botton, who was jailed for two years and fined F2m (#266,000).
The mayor of the Riviera resort of Cannes, Michel Mouillot, and
France's most popular television newscaster Patrick Poivre d'Arvor each
received a 15-month suspended sentence and a F200,000 (#26,000)
fine.--Reuter.

A RUSSIAN seaman stopped by police at Regent Quay, Aberdeen Harbour,
just hours after buying a second hand car to take home, was fined #100
and banned from driving for a year, at the city's sheriff court
yesterday.
Mr Vladislav Selivanov, a 23-year-old electrician on the Podmajkovje,
was noticed by police driving without lights and, when stopped, was
smelling strongly of alcohol and did not have an insurance certificate.
Depute fiscal, Miss Sally Cullen, told the court that when he was
taken to police headquarters, Mr Selivanov refused to blow properly into
a breath-test machine.
He admitted driving without insurance and failing to give a proper
sample of breath.
Defence lawyer, Mr Dave Mollison, said his client, who earned about
#2.80 a day, had bought the car for #350.
He said that drivers in Russia did not need insurance, but he admitted
Mr Selivanov had been drinking.
Sheriff Graeme Warner said the circumstances were unusual and fined Mr
Selivanov #100 and banned him from driving for a year. He admonished him
on the insurance charge.

Islamabad, Thursday
PAKISTANI Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has ordered that compensation
be paid to the family of a murdered 12-year-old Christian campaigner
against child labour.
''It's an outrage,'' said Bhutto's foreign-affairs adviser Zafer
Hilaly. ''We don't know the motive for the killing but the Prime
Minister is very exercised about it.''
He said Bhutto had asked Population and Social Welfare Minister Julius
Salik to visit Iqbal Masih's family in the village of Muritke, near
Lahore, and tell them they would receive 200,000 rupees (#4300) in
compensation.
In Geneva, members of a UN Working Group on Contemporary Forms of
Slavery hailed the boy as a symbol of the fate awaiting many human
rights fighters around the world.
''This courageous former child slave's tragic fate highlights the
risks faced by those in many countries who reveal grave human rights
violations,'' said Professor Clare Palley, British representative on the
Working Group.
Ehsanullah Khan, the president of the Bonded Labour Liberation Front
of Pakistan, says Masih had been the target of feudal landlords and
carpet-industry owners and received death threats shortly before he was
killed on Sunday.
It was not clear if the murder was linked to Masih's activities for
the front, which freed him from his work as a bonded carpet weaver in
1992.
Two young relatives told police Iqbal had been murdered by a man they
discovered engaged in bestiality with a donkey. The man fled after
shooting Iqbal dead on the spot with a 12-bore shotgun, they claimed.
Iqbal Masih gave an account of his life as a bonded weaver at an
international labour conference in Stockholm in November and went to
Boston in December to receive a Reebok ''Youth in Action'' human-rights
award for his work against child labour.
Hilaly said Islamabad was very concerned about the problem of child
labour, which he said remained widespread in Pakistan even though it had
been legally abolished in 1991.
''In the social setting of Pakistan, child labour has existed for ever
and ending it has to be an evolutionary process,'' he said.
''We must create the realisation among parents that their children are
better off at school so they can earn more later.''--Reuter.

THE Kirk is to be asked to urge the Government to review the system of
cash support for students in full-time higher education.
Serious concern about the financial plight of students is expressed in
a report issued by the Church of Scotland's Education Committee.
The report -- which will go before the General Assembly next month --
says that there is evidence of financial hardship among students and it
is getting to the point where many may be forced to drop out of higher
education.
''The combination of reduced grants with the abolition of entitlement
to vacation payments and housing benefits is pushing many students over
the financial edge,'' it says.
The report was welcomed by Mr Douglas Traynor, president of the
National Union of Students in Scotland, who said: ''It is yet another
voice in the chorus of support from all quarters who agree with what we
have been saying. But will the Government listen?''.
He said that students were currently facing their biggest hardship for
years.
According to the report, it has been estimated that the average sixth
former entering higher education next year will finish up #8000 in debt.
Student bodies have claimed the average debt at Edinburgh University
is #1200 and that 15% of students at St Andrews are considering dropping
out for financial reasons.

Tokyo, Thursday
JAPANESE authorities, stung by failure to prevent or solve poison-gas
attacks, hinted today at a crackdown on fringe religious groups and
introduction of wiretapping.
As police ran into dead ends in the search for clues to yesterday's
gas attack on the Yokohama railway system, calls grew in newspapers and
Parliament for measures that would lift a reign of terror the nation has
lived under for a month.
Police frustration at the lack of progress was summed up by retraction
of an assessment that a First World War phosgene gas was used in the
attack in Yokohama, where more than 500 people needed hospital
treatment.
More detailed examination of victims showed that phosgene, or mustard
gas, was not involved, leaving police with witness descriptions
describing the fumes as either ammonia, sulphur, hydrochloric acid, or
chlorine acid.
''We don't know what we have,'' a police spokesman said.
The frustration spilled over into newspaper editorials and questions
in Parliament.
''This chain of terrorist acts must stop,'' the mass circulation
Yomiuri Shimbun said. ''The security of this nation must be defended by
all means, and this is a task not just for the police.''
In Parliament, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and other Ministers
were asked angry questions about whether the time had come to ban the
doomsday cult linked to the March 20 Tokyo subway attack, which set off
the present climate of fear.
Justice Minister Isao Maeda, whose department will prosecute those
involved in the gas attacks, said the time may have come for legislation
to deal with terrorism in Japan.
''We will start considering the introduction of telephone tapping and
decoy operations, which are basically not allowed under current laws,''
Maeda told a parliamentary panel.
Under present law, such covert operations are only allowed in serious
drug-trafficking cases and not in other kinds of criminal or espionage
cases.
Education Minister Kaoru Yosano told the same panel he might order Aum
Shinri Kyo (the Supreme Truth Sect) to disband if it was behind the
Tokyo sarin nerve-gas and Yokohama attacks.
Police raids on sect facilities since the March 20 Tokyo attack, which
killed 12 people and injured more than 5000, have revealed all the
chemicals needed to make sarin.
Sect spokesmen have denied responsibility for the attack and police
have made no charges or arrests directly connected to the attack.
Yosano said the government also needed to review legislation governing
religious groups in Japan, where religious organisations are under the
jurisdiction of the Education Ministry.
Twenty-four hours after the Yokohama attack, where gas was released in
a train and at two stations in the sister port city of Tokyo, at least
21 people remained in hospital complaining of nausea, burning eyes, and
painful coughing.
However, hospital authorities said they should all be able to leave
before the weekend.

United Nations, Thursday
AMERICA'S UN envoy Madeleine Albright called for tighter curbs on
Libya today, telling the Security Council that a direct flight to Jeddah
by a Libyan airliner carrying Muslim pilgrims violated UN sanctions.
A US official gave details of closed-door council consultations during
which the Libyan flight was briefly discussed. ''Albright told the
council members that, in the view of the United States, the flight from
Libya is a definite violation of the sanctions regime,'' he said.
''This is yet another demonstration of Libya's disregard for the
international community and the rules that countries are supposed to
live by,'' Albright was quoted as saying.
''She stated that the solution was to tighten the sanctions on Libya,
and it is those apologists for Libya who resist the existing sanctions
and/or resist tightening sanctions that encourage this type of flouting
of the international community.''
Albright also called on all countries in the region to see that
sanctions were enforced, the official said.
Libya has been subject to UN sanctions since 1992 for failing to
surrender for trial the two men indicted in the United States and
Britain over the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, which killed 270 people.
The United States has for some time been urging an extension of
sanctions to include an oil embargo, but has been unable to win enough
support. The sanctions now include an air embargo, an arms ban,
downgrading of diplomatic ties, and a ban on Libyan imports of oil
equipment.
The Security Council's sanctions committee yesterday authorised the
Egyptian airline, EgyptAir, to conduct 45 return flights ferrying some
6000 Libyans from Tripoli and Benghazi to Jeddah for the Muslim haj.
However, before those flights got under way, a Libyan airliner flew to
Jeddah with 150 pilgrims without UN authorisation.
Security Council President Karel Kovanda of the Czech republic, who is
also chairman of the sanctions committee, told reporters the flight by
the Libyan airliner was a ''flagrant violation of sanctions''.
Kovanda, chairman of the sanctions committee, said he would ''be
surprised if the Security Council would not want to consider further how
to react to this violations of sanctions''.
Kovanda said that Egypt's UN representative told him last night that
Egypt had suspended the start of its air shuttle in light of the
unauthorised Libyan flight. However today the Egyptian envoy said he
believed Libya would not repeat its action and that the EgyptAir flights
would proceed.
Today, Libyans in Tripoli and other cities demonstrated their approval
of the flight, seeing it as a welcome gesture of defiance against
international efforts to isolate their country.
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi thanked Saudi Arabian King Fahd for
taking ''the correct and brave stand'' in welcoming Libyan pilgrims to
attend the haj.
Today, Saudi Arabia issued its annual instruction for pilgrims not to
engage in political activity during the festival.
In another development, Algeria and Libya urged the Security Council
to conduct a new investigation into the Lockerbie bombing ''so that the
truth can be established'' and sanctions be lifted.
The call, which condemned terrorism that uses the Muslim religion for
political ends, came in a joint statement by Gaddafi and President
Liamine Zeroual after a two-day summit in Algeria.--Reuter/AP.

Johannesburg, Thursday
DOCTORS treating Winnie Mandela said today that the president's
estranged wife was suffering from a severe ailment affecting blood
pressure and other functions.
Mrs Mandela was in serious but stable condition tonight at
Johannesburg's Linksfield Park Clinic.
She had entered the clinic for tests on Tuesday, a day after ending
her dispute with President Nelson Mandela by resigning from his Cabinet.
Initial reports indicated her condition was related to stress and was
not serious.
Today, however, the clinic's managing director, Dr Peter Kalish, said
an examination and tests revealed ''a severe electrolyte imbalance
affecting her kidney function, blood pressure and blood sugar''.
Kalish added that Mrs Mandela's condition was ''in no way related to
stress or any other possible psychosomatic disorder.''
Mrs Mandela announced on Monday that she was resigning from President
Nelson Mandela's Cabinet, one day before her dismissal was to take
effect.
Mandela had sacked his wife as Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture,
Science, and technology on March 27, after her involvement in a string
of embarrassing incidents.
Mrs Mandela went to court to challenge her dismissal, prompting the
president to re-instate her just long enough to consult with other party
leaders, a constitutional requirement he had at first neglected.
The president, who has been separated from Mrs Mandela since 1992,
sacked her again last week, saying the action was in the interest of
discipline and good government.
Mrs Mandela is popular among grassroots members of Mandela's African
National Congress, but the organisation has strongly supported the
president in the tug-of-war over her Cabinet post. She has pledged to
continue working for the ANC.--AP.

Washington, Thursday
THE United States today pressed for more negotiations with North Korea
after talks in Berlin broke off, but warned that it will once again
pursue UN sanctions if Pyongyang resumes its nuclear programme.
''It's true that from our vantage point the United States and North
Korea had an unproductive meeting today in Berlin and that we have not
made the progress in this latest round in Berlin that we had hoped to
make,'' said State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.
''That said, we are prepared to continue meeting and discuss these
issues if the North Korean delegation is willing. Our delegation will
remain in Berlin until at least the weekend.''
Signs from Berlin were not encouraging, with North Korea's delegation
planning to return home tomorrow night.
The talks have focused on what type of light-water nuclear reactors
Pyongyang would receive as part of a #3000m deal with the US.
The stumbling block is the US demand that South Korea be the primary
supplier and fabricator of the reactors.
Pyongyang has rejected the idea of letting its arch-rival reorganise
its nuclear industry, but proposed allowing South Korea a subordinate
role.
Burns urged North Korea to maintain a freeze on its nuclear programme,
in place since the two sides signed their landmark nuclear accord in
Geneva last October.
Pyongyang has threatened to restart the programme if no agreement was
reached by tomorrow.--Reuter.

As the Nolan Inquiry wound up yesterday Government ministers were left
decidedly uneasy over indications that the committee's recommendations
could curb their future employment prospects
THERE are mutterings that some ministers will resign if the leaks
emanating from the Nolan Inquiry prove true. They are worried, not about
appointments to quangos or MPs' links with lobbyists nor even by the
prospect of further titillation scantily dressed up as sex scandal on a
Sunday. The agitation is over whether the inquiry will, as sources
indicated yesterday, suggest tight rules be imposed on what they can do
when they leave office.
Some called Lord Nolan's committee the most penetrating inquiry yet
into probity in public life. The tabloids termed him the Sleazebuster.
Those who stand and stare, dismayed, at the prospect of the life belts
being thrown overboard from the ship of state might have cause to be
less complimentary.
The Westminster pundits point out that the jitters are revealing that
many ministers believe they will be out of office in a couple of years
and want to be able to earn some money while in opposition.
There is also a real sense of personal grievance. Ministerial
salaries, they argue, have fallen sharply in real terms over the past 20
years. Many promising ministers point out that they have to accept a
substantial loss of salary when they accept office. They therefore
resent the suggestion that they should be prevented from taking up jobs
if they lose office, and possibly also their seat in the Commons.
The inquiry wound up yesterday with clear hints that ministers might
have to accept the same strictures on future employment as those imposed
on civil servants.
Any private sector posts taken up by senior civil servants when they
leave public service have to be reviewed by the Business Appointments
Committee and there is a waiting period of up to two years if the job is
related to their previous responsibilities.
Some mandarins have voiced resentment that the code does not apply to
their political masters -- as any cursory glance at the CVs of some
prominent former ministers clearly shows.
Ministers, however, argue that they are in an entirely different
position. Their departure from office is seldom planned. It is often
involuntary and sudden. They say it would be wrong to erect further
barriers which deter MPs from accepting ministerial posts.
In his evidence to Nolan, Public Service Minister David Hunt claimed
any such restrictions could be interpreted as a restraint on trade. He
argued hard that the guidelines in Questions of Procedure for Ministers
were sufficient in saying that former ministers should avoid ''any
course which would reflect adversely on their or the Government's
reputation for integrity''.
That is unlikely to have impressed Lord Nolan. He eloquently gave
voice to the public unease at the perceived tide of sleaze which
threatened to engulf the Government and prompted John Major to adopt a
Canute posture as the waves lapped around Parliament.
Lord Nolan stressed ''the depth of public worries about standards of
conduct in public life, coupled with damaging cynicism about the motives
of those who go into it''.
Hunt's insistence that former ministers who return to business careers
are comparable to those who go back to the law or journalism misses the
point. The concern is not over ex-ministers who become directors, but
those who join the boards of companies which they have had a hand in
privatising.
In his Lord Mayor's banquet speech last year, John Major condemned MPs
who use their position to pick up lucrative jobs outside politics. The
House of Commons he declared should not be a ''hiring fair''.
The neat irony of squaring those laudable sentiments with the public
perception of nest feathering by ex-ministers may not have been lost on
Lord Nolan's committee.
The key word a number of former ministers were hoping for from the
Nolan report is reassurance.
In its own evidence, the Government argued that there are no
fundamental problems, and some tidying up at the edges is all that is
needed. This will enable the public to believe all is well with the ship
of state and those who sail in her.
Such was the line given by Tony Newton, Leader of the House, in
evidence when he rejected any suggestion that the time had come to stop
politicians regulating themselves.
To many MPs all of this is about unsavoury tactics by an overmighty
media determined to discredit the entire political class. David Hunt, in
an angry outburst to the committee, said allegations about ministerial
''jobs for the boys'' were ''slurs, innuendo and downright lies'' or
political smear-mongering.
Yesterday Sir James Spicer, a Tory member of the Privileges Committee,
slapped down the suggestion that an outside body should investigate MPs'
behaviour. Criticising the Nolan committee, he said it had no knowledge
of the inner workings of the House of Commons.
''There can be no tougher jury out on anybody who commits any
malfeasance than a committee of one's peers. I think we have shown that
we will deal very toughly with those people who transgress,'' he said.
The difficulty for the Government is that the cumulative effect of a
year of unprecedented accusations and admissions of sleaze, sexual
impropriety, and dishonour among MPs is devastating to confidence in the
body politic. According to Lord Nolan himself it had caused the nation
to lose faith in its leaders.
No political party has a monopoly of morality. In the present climate
of public mistrust of politicans, whatever the scale of ethical
slackness currently undermining Parliament's authority, it is a safe bet
that many voters will conclude that one lot's as bad as the other.
Lord Nolan's response is expected to include reforms aimed at cleaning
up the grubby face of public affairs. It may involve an outside ethics
auditor as part of the package. And to the chagrin of those who see the
lifeboat being pushed out of their reach, it might cost them dear. Most
though are likely to conclude it would be self-defeating to jump ship
before they are pushed.

IN rugby jargon, it could be said that Gordon Kennedy had broken away
from the pack and made a touchdown between the posts. From being just a
familiar face he has gone on to the superleague of recognition -- and
all because of a 15-minute Saturday night television programme that
doesn't stretch his talents.
National Lottery Live, which he co-presents with Anthea Turner on
BBC1, means more than 20 million people now know what he looks like. And
at 6ft 2ins and 16 stone, he is the kind of guy who stands out in a
crowd.
The rugby analogy is appropriate as he devoted 10 years to playing the
game, mainly for Watsonians, as did his older brothers Euan and Bill.
He is possibly the most modest man on television, with a refreshingly
laid-back way of putting himself down. However, he is realist enough to
see his present five months of fame as a bankable commodity which will
pay dividends, such as the comedy pilot, Mac, on which he is
simultaneously working in Glasgow for BBC2 by way of BBC Scotland.
Kennedy ''sort of fell into showbusiness'', having taken part in
school entertainments at George Watson's College in his native
Edinburgh, as had the three others with whom he was eventually to set up
the comedy revue group The Bodgers.
At first he thought it was an architect's life for him. ''But I was a
crap architect, slung out of the Scott Sutherland School, Aberdeen,
after a year,'' he says.
Next he did the four-year teaching course at Jordanhill College,
Glasgow, but after he qualified there were no PE teaching jobs here, so
he taught in a school in London, and also got his foot in the door of
the comedy circuit venues.
He and his pals had admired the Edinburgh Fringe work of people like
Rowan Atkinson, Emma Thompson, Fry and Laurie and decided they might
make some money with their own show. That was how they came to be
Bodgering on the Fringe during the first half of the eighties,
collecting a couple of Perrier nominations.
They wanted to get into broadcasting but BBC Scotland was going strong
with Naked Radio, Naked Video shows that were to make stars of Robbie
Coltrane, Gregor Fisher, and others. ''Scottish Television didn't have a
comedy unit. So Scotland was full.''
The team was invited to London for its first Radio 4 series. And that
was about the time Kennedy was to go versatile in a big way, appearing
in everything from the Russ Abbott Show to Inspector Morse and Red
Dwarf. He played Eddie and Dr Scott in The Rocky Horror Show at the
Piccadilly Theatre, London, and was in a Scottish production of The
Taming of the Shrew. And ''because Robbie Coltrane and Craig Ferguson
were both busy'' he made his film debut with Julie Walters in Just Like
a Woman.
With a team of writers/performers he set up a company to do the
Absolutely series for Channel 4. And suddenly he was in demand from
television producers all over the country.
After the Mac pilot, the team will be writing another Absolutely
series. And Mystic Meg (who is not a member of the Royal Shakespeare
Company) has predicted that he will be appearing with Robbie Coltrane in
an episode of Cracker this year. At the age of 36 he is set for a new
phase in his career.

Cameron Fyfe: winning an arranged Asian marriage annulment launched
him into the media spotlight and led to a series of high profile cases.
Legal David seeks new Goliaths
Ruth Wishart talks to a lawyer whose appetite for unusual cases has
gained him a reputation to be envied
IT wasn't the sort of casual inquiry which the Citizen's Advice Bureau
dealt with on a day-to-day basis. What Nasreem Akman wanted to know was
how she went about obtaining an annulment of an arranged marriage, into
which she had been forced by her family when she was just 14.
The CAB decided to call in the cavalry in the shape of Glasgow law
firm Ross Harper Murphy, and the case landed on the desk of managing
partner, Cameron Fyfe.
It was never going to be just another case; it was clearly going to
establish some sort of precedent. But never for a moment, recalls Fyfe,
did he imagine that one bit of legal business was about to alter the
entire tenor of a hitherto successful but largely anonymous career.
In the event, the annulment didn't entail too much burning of the
midnight oil. There was no necessity for the court to be convinced about
family pressures, only to satisfy itself that whatever else her
circumstances, the bride had been two years under age in Scots law at
the time of the ceremony.
''The ones which came in after that were often much more complex; and
unlike Nasreem they specifically sought us out because of her case. So
in all we've dealt with about 30 similar cases. We haven't lost one
yet,'' said Fyfe.
The case didn't just catapult the 40-year-old Dumfries-born lawyer
into the media spotlight, it rekindled an appetite for legal drama he'd
developed during his years doing criminal work in Edinburgh.
''That was always very exciting, appearing before a jury, trying to
get a result. I always loved the High Court stuff, a 'good' murder or a
rape -- the drama of it all with so much at stake. You knew that if you
got it wrong, your client could be facing 20 years. You loved the chance
to get a good point in.
''But there's a saying in the law that you only have so many trials in
your soul, and I think that's right. After a while the sheer excitement
wore off and you found yourself asking the same old questions and
suggesting to the same old police officer that he might be telling less
than the truth.''
Fyfe moved to be in charge of the court department of his firm, which
dictated that even if he still hankered after the comparative drama of
the courtroom, life was literally too short to manage that and a staff
of 20. And latterly, when the civil and criminal operations at Ross
Harper Murphy were merged under one roof, he was given overall control.
It might have been more than enough to satisfy most ambitious young
men in his trade. It might have been enough for Fyfe, but for that first
annulment case and the extraordinary splash in the media when the facts
became public knowledge.
At first he was quite literally overwhelmed by the queue of
journalists round the door wanting to put some tabloid flesh on the dry
bones of the courtroom statement. Then, and not so very gradually
either, he found he rather liked performing for the media circus.
''Looking back, I can understand the fuss, given that the social
implications made it quite important. But at first the initial shock of
being the centre of so much attention was quite stunning. Then, when I
got used to having cameras facing me and having questions fired at me, I
found it all rather a nice change from the usual tedium. After all, it's
a lot easier managing a five-minute TV interview than conducting a case
lasting three weeks.
He didn't, he insists, go looking for any publicity, did not actively
seek out cases that might make similar causes celebre. What happened, he
suggests, is that having his name in the legal equivalent of lights for
so long attracted the attention of other people with difficult and
unusual cases to pursue.
Some came via other lawyers, some from the media. But now they were
asking for him by name. In Scottish terms, only a handful of lawyers
over the years have achieved household name status, and most of those
came under the heading of ''be sure to phone if guilty''. Fyfe's lately
developed celebrity status not only has different origins, but has led
to a series of high profile cases, each one of which is characterised by
its originality.
Perhaps the most important of these, in terms of its potential impact,
is the decision to proceed with an action raised by the widow of Alfred
McTear against the Imperial Tobacco company, despite her failure to win
legal aid. The case rests on whether or not it can be proved that
executives of that company continued to market their products without
proper warning, after they knew of its addictive properties.
''And I think we have a good chance of winning,'' declares Fyfe.
''After all, if a soft drink firm continued to market a product knowing
that it could kill children, there would be no confusion about their
liability. We're confident we can win, in which case Imperial Tobacco
will have to pay us, and that makes it a risk worth taking.''
The risk factor, after all, is relatively small. The firm do a lot of
hard graft for no money, but stand to gain massive publicity if they
succeed in a mission which has so far defeated the best legal brains in
America. The senior and junior counsel have agreed to waive their fees,
as have those contributing medical evidence; so it would be an unusually
public spirited victory, as well as a famous one for those other players
in the game.
For Mrs McTear, it has now become a piece of business she's determined
to finish, not only because of her own loss, but because she is
convinced only such a major courtroom precedent can stop tobacco
marketing in its well-heeled tracks. Fyfe, in contrast, views the issue
quite dispassionately.
''I never become emotionally involved in cases. Emotion makes you a
bad lawyer. But just the same it's an interesting case. Imperial Tobacco
and their lawyers trying to stop us at every turn, and this wee lady
from a Beith council house against this massive machine. It's classic
David and Goliath.''
The McTear action came via Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), who
were keen to process a test case, and if the Fyfe team win it, the queue
of litigants waiting to use the precedent will have formed before the
court rises.
At the moment, Fyfe reckons they're no more than a third of the way up
a very long haul, but the current tactics are such that if they are
successful in their application for a court order against Imperial
Tobacco, the US company's legal team would be obliged to produce the
required documentation at the Court of Session in Edinburgh. Not an
event liable to diminish Mr Fyfe's considerable visibility.
''Almost all the cases which have hit the press have been as a result
of either the Akmal or the McTear cases,'' he says. ''People either
heard my name or the firm's name, and it seems to have a sort of double
effect . . . people either thought they had something of a legal
landmark, or they thought it was the right kind of case for our firm.''
The right kind of case for Fyfe, by his own admission, is one with
some kind of novelty value, and he's now in the happy position of being
able to pick and choose his portfolios from the variety that cross the
RHM threshold.
''And I have to admit, they're much more fun than day-to-day
management, which can be fairly dreary. Also, the nature of the average
lawyer doesn't easily lend itself to cases which involve a lot of media
exposure. They're pretty cautious as a rule, and very wary of the
media.''
In contrast, and perhaps uniquely, Fyfe waxes enthusiastic about the
press, actively enjoys the company of journalists over lunches and
drinks, and claims never to have found himself misquoted or manipulated.
Then again, you suspect the quietly spoken exterior gives very little
clue to the sharp mind in operation within. Not only other lawyers might
have trouble getting men like Fyfe to say anything they didn't care to,
incriminating or not. Go on to the subject of his personal life, for
instance, and a discernible note of caution is sounded.
He cheerfully admits to getting married later this year for the first
time, but declines to name his bride, first or last name, explaining
that she enjoys privacy as much as he relishes publicity.
He thinks, perhaps, that his lengthy spell as a divorce lawyer might
have subconsciously affected his decision not to marry before, and
acknowledges that having met his wife-to-be over two years ago, he can't
be accused of sprinting to the altar, even when the right partner
emerged.
''I guess working in divorce cases makes you pretty wary . . . it
makes you think you want to be damned sure you can get the right one
yourself.'' Unlike one of his more memorable clients who wed in a coffee
break. Unsurprisingly, the man isnow divorced.
His leisure interests take him far from the legal fraternity, whom he
appears to think only just have the edge over accountants in the social
boredom stakes. Instead he golfs, plays tennis, and seeks solitude on
the tops of Scottish hills. The walls of friends are likely to boast his
amateur watercolours, and he enjoys both travel and a cosmopolitan
palate, while confessing to being a pretty dire chef in his own kitchen.
Marriage will take him from the leafy suburb of Bearsden, to the north
of Glasgow, to the leafy suburb of Newlands, in the south. Glaswegians
consider the divide psychologically important, but not many Scots from
elsewhere would notice the change, and it's clearly a matter of relative
indifference to the groom.
Over the horizon loom some more of Scotland's ''sexier'' cases . . . a
woman suffering from what's known as ''Gulf war syndrome'', and an
action being contemplated by the family of the woman killed by the blast
of a demolition team in the Glasgow Gorbals.
One rejected with regret was the intriguing case of the pools winners
whose regular collector had made off with the stake the week they won.
''If we had the funds we'd go to court, but none of the people involved
qualify for legal aid and we wouldn't do this one speculatively because
we don't have the same faith in it,'' said Fyfe.
''We think we could beat the pools company on every legal point, but
the problem, and it's a crazy one, is that you can't sue for a gambling
debt. So you have a national lottery run by the Government, and if you
won #13m and didn't get it, you couldn't sue. The law isn't an ass, but
there are examples where you enforce the rules to such an extent that it
does become a joke.''
His latest wheeze, however, is to try to engender a talent lost in his
school days, when his love of a good argument took him into law rather
than the arts. For what Mr Fyfe would most like to succeed at is
writing. His first published attempt, The Layman's Guide to Scotland's
Law, has just been published by Mainstream, and combines some pithy
anecdotes from his own cases with short, sharp, accessible answers to
the most common questions asked about our legal system.
All his own royalties are destined for research into leukaemia, the
disease to which he lost his mother when he was 20. Lawyers may not
always get a good press, but it doesn't mean they don't have a heart.

Family doctors feel they are being treated like all-night garages.
Medical Correspondent Alan MacDermid reports on the payments they seek
for being called out after hours
IT'S FIVE in the morning and the mother at the other end of the line
wants the GP to see her one-year-old with a headache. She also has a
child of 13 and makes no bones about it: ''When he was that age I would
have given him a paracetamol. Now it is meningitis until a doctor tells
me he is all right.''
This is one of the milder anecdotes family doctors are likely to swop
in their longstanding grievance over 24-hour cover, the latest chapter
of which was being played out yesterday by their negotiating body -- the
General Medical Services Committee -- and the Government.
Heightened sensitivity about health is just one of the factors that
have brought about a three-fold increase in night call-outs to family
doctors over the past 20 years.Even stronger feelings among family
doctors are likely to be aroused by the change in attitudes towards
themselves by many of their patients -- in particular the perception
that they are a round-the-clock service, like the all-night garage or
telephone banking.
Some of the dafter reasons for night calls are now legend in GP
circles -- running out of condoms is probably the classic.
''I think the feeling of the committee is that there are changes in
people's attitudes -- expecting to get service at all times of the day
or night, and lumping GPs into that category,'' said Balfron GP Dr Brian
Keighley, vice-chairman of the Scottish GP's committee.
''They have been encouraged by the Government through the Patients'
Charter to make these kinds of demands, and we feel the Government has a
responsibility to redress the effect of the Charter and get people to
take a bit more responsibility.
''That is why we want a TV campaign to reinforce the idea that the
service at night is not the same service as during the day. It really
must be for emergencies.
''I think we would support people's consciousness being raised about
the dangers of meningitis, for example, but it does not necessarily mean
people need a doctor's attendance for a headache or a temperature
without doing something themselves, like giving a painkiller or cool
spongeing.''
This dispute, the doctors emphasise, is not about money. At an average
salary of #41,000, a GP with a busy surgery ahead of him or her in the
morning would just as soon stay in bed all night, perhaps taking turns
to man one of the all-night primary care centres which were announced a
year ago.
Although, on the face of it, the offer from Health Minister Gerald
Malone appeared to be a major advance on the previous offer, the GPs are
still suspicious about some of the implications -- in particular where
the new money is coming from; hence the call for further negotiations
before the offer is put to a ballot.
To replace the current arrangements -- a straightforward fee of #47.85
for each visit -- the Government were offering a lump sum of #2000 a
year plus #9 per visit.
That was simply a re-working of the money being paid previously, and
obviously some GPs would benefit more than others. A GP who got no night
calls would have #2000 gratis, while someone at the other extreme,
coping with lots of night calls at #9 a time, might feel he was getting
a raw deal. In fact, what the GPs are looking for, more than money, is
an escape from the night-call trap.
So, in addition, the Government were putting up #15m to be dispensed
at the discretion of Family Health Service Authorities in England and
Wales to promote alternative schemes, like GP co-operatives, all-night
health centres, or help for rural doctors to hire locums.
When the General Medical Services Council met yesterday, they had a
fax from the Department of Health waiting for them with an improvement
on all this.The #2000 lump sum remains, but the fee per night visit goes
up from #9 to #20. And the #15m -- which covered only England Wales --
goes up to #45m, covering Scotland as well.
''Two years' negotiations have been reduced to a two-page fax, with
double-line spacing, so there is a lot of detail to be ironed out with
the department before we proceed to the ballot,'' said Dr Keighley.
''Mr Malone seemed to think it would be a simple yes or no, and the
rest would come out in the wash.
''They have now found this extra money from a pocket they apparently
didn't know they had. It would seem that the #20 fee is only payable for
face-to-face consultation with doctors who are attached to the practice;
it can't be passed on to deputising doctors, so if you use a deputising
service you have to pay them, and you don't get the fee. There is a
double jeopardy there.
''I don't think this is going to do anything to change the huge
increase in night calls we have had over the years. One of the things
the #45m is supposed to do is give the health boards discretion to
encourage ways of developing primary care emergency services, or helping
rural doctors recover locum costs.
''However, many rural doctors can't use locums and we would like to
see them being able to use that money more imaginative ways, like
equipping themselves with mobile phones or the other accessories that
make life a bit more bearable.''

SIX of 20 Russian skaters stranded in Oklahoma City since last autumn,
when the sponsor of their US tour left them high and dry, were injured
in the car bombing. The skaters were living in the YMCA across the
street from the Alfred Murrah Federal Building. Brenda McLean, general
manager for the Russian Ballet on Ice, said the skaters have found
another temporary home. ''This definitely wasn't what I planned for
their American experience,'' she said. The bad luck that has dogged the
skaters began when a California investor backed out on sponsoring a
35-city tour. They lost their hotel rooms on Thanksgiving Day when they
could not pay the bill and had moved seven times before Wednesday's
blast.

Oklahoma City, Thursday
DOWNTOWN Oklahoma City was all business today -- the ghastly business
of cleaning up after death and destruction.
National guardsmen closed off a 20-block area around the Alfred P.
Murrah Building, which was shattered by a car bomb yesterday. Now only
those with work to do -- doctors, police, construction teams -- were
getting through.
Dr Rick Nelson, a surgeon from Muskogee, Oklahoma, about 130 miles
away, swayed with fatigue after working nearly 24 hours as a volunteer
in the wreckage. ''I consider myself somewhat lucky because I work with
the dead and the dying every day,'' he said.
Then, looking back at the carnage, Dr Nelson appeared close to tears.
''In there, there is only the dead,'' he said.
At least three dozen people died in the explosion and officials are
certain many more will be found in the collapsed rubble of the building.
Police patrolled on horses, golf carts, bicycles, marked and unmarked
cars, keeping gawkers away. Even people who own businesses in the
20-square-block security zone could not get through.
''But my business is in there and nobody is watching it,'' complained
Roger Preston, operator of a car repair shop.
''Mister, I will guarantee you that the United States Army and the
Oklahoma Highway Patrol will not let any harm come to your property,''
said a grim-faced National Guard sergeant.
''Yeah, where were you guys yesterday?'' Preston shot back.
Occasionally the barricades were lifted so that dump trucks could
leave, carrying away debris from the US Government office building and
other property damaged by the force of the blast. Much of the wreckage
was taken to a guarded lot in case investigators needed to check it
further for evidence.
The American Red Cross, the Salvation Army and several Oklahoma
companies donated sandwiches, bottled water, doughnuts and coffee to the
workers and police. Empty Red Cross cups blew this way and that through
the piles of broken glass and between twisted and burned cars.
Agnes Morttin, a bystander holding hands with a crying little girl,
expressed the anger of many when she said she hoped whoever was
responsible for the bombing would be brought back to Oklahoma City to be
tried.
''Make no mistake, this means war,'' she said, clenching her jaw and
shaking her head.
Albert Carl, wearing a baseball cap with the words ''Gulf War
Veteran'' on it, was delivering another message to those responsible.
''This here is a battle scene -- right here in the heart of America,''
he said as he taped tiny dimestore American flags on parking meters all
over town.
''Whoever did this deed, they need to see these flags to see who we
are and what we believe in,'' he said.
Minutes after the explosion devastated the government office building,
volunteers were arriving on the scene, tearing at the ruins with their
bare hands in the frantic search for survivors, writes JAMES PIERPOINT
In the tradition of America's heartland, where almost everyone is
a neighbour, people from all walks of life piled in to help. Disc jockey
Kirk Reid, 26, one of the first volunteers on the scene, was quickly
drafted by officials to help in the search.
Down the street, Frances Jones of the Feed the Children charity
organisation was contacting restaurants and volunteers to co-ordinate
hot meals for hundreds of rescue workers, police and hospital staff
descending on the city following the first news reports of the tragedy.
Across the country, search and rescue crews from as far away as
Phoenix, Arizona, and Sacramento, California, were scrambling onto
airplanes headed to Oklahoma City, where they aided the rescue effort,
pulling survivors out of the wreckage almost as soon as their feet hit
the ground. A group of nurses from Kansas City, unbidden, piled into
their cars and drove more than 200 miles to help care for the injured.
''It's like everybody just came down here as fast as they could to see
what they could do,'' Sarah Atwood, a student at the University of
Central Oklahoma, said today.
What spurred many of the volunteers were reports about the children,
who accounted for six of the first eight people reported dead in the
first news accounts of the explosion.
''When the help really started pouring in is when they heard about the
children,'' said Robin Griffin, who had been shuttling rescue workers
between the scene of the disaster and local hotels, where they grabbed a
few hours of sleep before heading back to help in whatever ways they
could.
While trying to lend a helping hand to the victims, volunteers say
they too have been touched by the tragedy.
''I will not get any rest until they pull every survivor out of the
debris,'' said Salvation Army volunteer Fred Collins, 17, still shaken
by trips to take coffee and food to workers inside the gutted building.
Ms Jones said her Feed the Children charity was more accustomed to
dealing with tragedies outside the country, or at least outside
Oklahoma. ''This is a frightening and scary thing when it happens here
at home,'' she said.
She said the tragedy had also hit home across America. ''I think we've
reached a new place in history with the bombing of the World Trade
Center and now in Oklahoma City,'' Jones said. ''It's not going to be
the same any more.''
*As rescuers picked gingerly through the crumbling skeleton of the
wrecked building, Oklahoma City Fire Chief Gary Marrs said the searchers
faced ''a very, slow tedious process.''
They were using tiny cameras and teams of dogs in the painstaking hunt
for the missing, worried that the building could collapse if they used
heavy equipment.
Mr Marrs said the hunt could take up to six more days. He added that
by this morning, searchers were no longer hearing sounds of survivors
beneath the wreckage.--Reuter.

AN irreversible psychological threshold was crossed in America on
Wednesday when a car-bomb exploded outside a government office building
in Oklahoma City.
Previously, Americans thought terrorism was something that happened
elsewhere, a phenomenon confined to the already violent Middle East or
revolution-prone countries of Latin America.
Even when the Americans considered the possibility of terrorism within
their own borders it was regarded as a threat relevant only to the big
metropolises on either coast.
The bombing in Oklahoma City has shattered that illusion. While the
attack's motive remains unknown, its perpretrators likely sought to take
advantage of the city's generally lower security profile and lack of
preparedness to deal with so catastrophic a terrorist incident.
Thus Americans clearly can no longer believe themselves immune to such
violence anywhere within their own borders. The fatally-false sense of
security in which they have wrapped themselves has been dramatically
ripped away, not only by the heinous act itself, but by its totally
unsuspecting location as well.
The incident further underscores how dangerous a place the world --
and indeed America as well -- has become in the post-cold war era.
Americans once knew who and where their enemies were -- primarily the
former Soviet Union and its satellite states -- and where and how the
conflicts would be fought -- across the Central Front in Europe with
conventional and, in the worst case, nuclear, forces.
Today the threats confronting the United States are far more diffuse,
amorphous and engimatic, the struggle has become markedly unconventional
and its prosecution more a law enforcement than a military mission.
Moreover, the battlefield has seemingly been transformed from far away
war-zones to both the major urban centres and rural hinterland of
America.
Admittedly, the US has endured decades of mostly isolated or sporadic
campaigns of both ''homegrown'' and ''imported'' terrorism. Indigenous
terrorist organisations have included left-wing radicals opposed
initially to the Vietnam War and later to American military involvement
in Central America, as well as extremist right-wing/white supremacist
organisations espousing racism, anti-semitisms and tax resistance.
Terrorists motivated by specific, contentious domestic political
issues such as legalised abortion, animal rights, and the environment,
have also carried out attacks designed to draw attention to or further
their own, specific agendas.
Finally, individuals belonging to a variety of ethnic and emigre
groups residing in the US have used this country as a battleground in
which to prosecute historical, often centuries-old enmities against
rival ethnic or emigre peoples, internal dissidents or apostatesm and,
most often, against the diplomatic representatives of governments whom
these groups oppose.
The Oklahoma bombing, howoever, differs from these previous instances
of domestic terrorism in a number of respects. First, the sheer violence
and dimension of the attack dwarfs all previous terrorist acts that have
occurred in the United States. The World Trade Center blast -- which
killed six persons -- was the first terrorist incident in America since
1986 actually to kill anyone in that country; an astonishing statistic
given the staggering number of homicides that annually occur in the US:
an average that has rarely dropped below 20,000 during the past decade.
The Oklahoma incident, however, is likely to take its place among an
infamous pantheon of particularly lethal terrorist acts. Since the turn
of the century, for example, fewer than a dozen of all the terrorist
incidents committed worldwide have killed more than a 100 people. Scores
at the Murrah office building are already confirmed dead with the final
tally expected to rise to the hundreds. This potentially represents a
significant watershed in Americans' perceptions of their vulnerability
and suspectibility to future similarly grievious acts of violence.
Second, the carnage in Oklahoma city coupled with last month's less
lethal but more exotic terrorist attack involving the dispersal of sarin
nerve gas on the Tokyo underground have both arguably raised the stakes
for terrorists everywhere. Indeed, the pattern of terrorism over the
past three decades suggests that many groups are impelled by an inner
dynamic, an organisational imperative, towards escalation. Believing
that the public and media have become inured or de-sensitised to the
unending spiral of terrorist violence, these groups feel pushed to
undertake ever more spectacular and destructively lethal deeds today in
order to achieve the same effect a smaller action would have had ten or
15 years ago.
Accordingly, whomever struck in Oklahoma may have felt driven to
surpass the Tokyo incident in death and destruction. The implications of
this in-built escalatory trajectory are chilling. It is possible that
other terrorist groups throughout the world may now feel it necessary to
emulate or create their own versions of either the Tokyo or Oklahoma
City attacks in order to attract attention to themselves and their own
causes.
Third, the Oklahoma City incident does not appear to conform to the
traditional pattern of terrorist activity by known or even historically
familiar types of terrorist groups.
In the past, terrorist groups were recognisable primarily as
numerically small bands of individuals belonging to an organisation with
a defined set of political, social or economic objectives. However
disagreeable or distasteful the traditional terrorist group's aims and
motivations may have been, its ideology and intentions were at least
comprehensible and perhaps even understandable -- albeit politically
radical and personally fanatical.
These groups were trained at terrorist bases in countries known to
world intelligence agencies, their headquarters frequently issued
communiques claiming credit for their attacks -- and in some instances
even warning of impending operations -- and an identifiable leadership
with relevant connections to a foreign government or state were
discernible.
The Oklahoma City incident, however, thus far conforms to a new
pattern of terrorist activity, whereby responsibility not only is not
claimed by any identifiable terrorist group but identity of the act's
perpetrators and the nature of their grievance and cause remains for the
time being unannounced and therefore unknown.
This more amorphous and perhaps even transitory breed of terrorist
group is therefore all the more difficult for law enforcement
authorities to track and apprehend. As they will lack the ''footprints''
or modus operandi of an actual, existing terrorist organisation, it is
commensurately more difficult for law enforcement to get a firm idea or
build a complete picture of the dimensions of their intentions and
capabilities. Essentially, part-time terrorists, such loose groups of
individuals, may be indirectly influenced or remotely controlled by some
foreign government or non-governmental entity.
Accordingly, this type of ''amateur'' or enigmatic terrorist may
represeent even more of a threat than their predecessors. While less
control from some central command authority may indeed be exerted, this
may also result in fewer constraints on the terrorists' operations and
targets and fewer inhibitions on their desire to inflict indiscriminate
casualties -- such as Wednesday's incident suggests.
Given the Oklahoma City bombing, it is clear that the US faces a
threat of new and profoundly lethal dimensions. It is imperative,
therefore, if the US and other countries are to defend adequately
against these threats that their defences and attendant security
measures are dynamic: able to respond as effectively as possible under
the most difficult circumstances, keeping in mind all possibilities in
mind at all times, so as to avoid surprises and be prepared for all
contingencies. This is ineluctably an intelligence mission and should
now be a priority.
Dr Bruce Hoffman is Chairman of the International Relations Department
and Director of the Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political
Violence at St. Andrews University.

BRITAIN has offered the United States help in gathering intelligence
on those who carried out the Oklahoma attack, the Prime Minister told
MPs yesterday as it emerged that a suspect arriving in London on a
flight from Chicago was intercepted and returned to the US.
Mr Major told a sombre House of Commons that he had spoken to
President Clinton and offered assistance, as MPs set aside party
politics to condemn the bombing.
Although Mr Major and Opposition party leaders expressed their disgust
at the crime and their condolences for the bereaved, a number of Tory
MPs called on Mr Clinton to reconsider his support for Sinn Fein in the
wake of the bombing.
They warned that the US administration risked becoming an
''apologist'' for terrorists, after ignoring British advice not to grant
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams a visa last month.
Speaking in the Commons, Mr Major said: ''It is hard to convey the
depth of feeling I believe everyone will have in their hearts about the
hideous act of barbarism and terrorism in Oklahoma.
''I have been in touch with President Clinton. I have expressed our
profound sympathy to him and to the country, the bereaved and the
injured. I have told him that we are ready to help in any way we can and
as events will show, we are assisting.''
Sources said that the assistance was in the form of unspecified
intelligence, based on Britain's experience of dealing with terrorism,
and confirmed that the return of an American national arriving from the
US was part of the help.
Although no criticism of the US was made in the Commons yesterday, a
number of MPs suggested that America's support for Sinn Fein and its
overtures to Mr Adams were inconsistent with its condemnation of those
who bombed the Alfred Murrah building in Oklahoma City.
Mr David Wilshire, Tory MP for Spelthorne, wrote to the American
ambassador in London, Admiral William Crowe. In his letter he condemned
the attack but asks Admiral Crowe to explain the difference between
those who carried out the Oklahoma bombing and ''the foreign-funded and
equipped IRA killers who bomb London and maim innocent people in the
UK''.
Macclesfield MP Nicholas Winterton tabled a Commons motion expressing
''sorrow, horror, and anger'' at the attack but expressing regret that
''in recent months President Clinton has given credibility to terrorists
and their apologists in Sinn Fein.''

<HEADLINE>Three-year sentence for drunken stabbing</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AN under-age drinker who stabbed a man in the street was sent to a
young offenders' institution for three years yesterday at the High Court
in Edinburgh.
Unemployed Graham McBride had consumed up to 15 shots of the Italian
liqueur, Sambuca, and five pints of lager before stabbing his victim.
Lord Milligan pointed out to McBride that he had taken the equivalent
of the recommended weekly alcohol-intake for a healthy adult.
McBride was aged 17 when he stabbed Gary Flood in Dumbarton Road,
Clydebank, on November 25 last year.
McBride, of Invercanny Drive, Drumchapel, Glasgow, was originally
charged with attempting to murder Mr Flood, c/o Clydebank police.
But the Crown accepted his guilty plea to the reduced charge of
assault to severe injury and to the danger of life.
Mr Flood's liver was cut by the knife and he suffered six other
superficial wounds to his chest and abdomen. He was in hospital for four
days.
McBride first appeared at Glasgow High Court, but sentence was
deferred until yesterday for a psychologist's report.
It showed that McBride himself had earlier been the victim of an
assault and was suffering from post-traumatic stress.
Lord Milligan said that ''with some hesitation'' he was prepared to
impose a sentence at the lower end of the scale for such an offence.
McBride was given three-years' detention with a further month for
breaching bail.

A CALL for Scottish Homes to strengthen its ties with local enterprise
companies to help improve future regeneration projects was made
yesterday.
Launching the agency's three-year strategic programme in Edinburgh,
chief executive Mr Peter McKinlay said housing must be more closely
integrated with the activities of enterprise and financial networks.
''Housing investment and local economic development are essential
complementary elements in any regeneration strategy in our towns, cities
and rural areas,'' Mr McKinlay said.
It is a message he will be emphasising next week in Glasgow, when he
meets representatives of 13 local enterprise companies.
Mr McKinlay said there was no question of the agency's trying to
compete for enterprise funding. But it was vital that it worked more
closely with the LECs at strategic and operational levels. It must also
strengthen its links with other key partners, such as the new
single-tier councils.
Scottish Homes's planned #1000m investment programme would attract a
further #500m of finance from banks, building societies, and other
financial institutions over the three-year period. Around 25,000 new and
improved houses would be provided in urban and rural areas.
It was essential, Mr McKinlay said, that this substantial investment
brought about the maximum possible social, economic, and environmental
benefit to local communities.
The director of the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, Mr
David Orr, said his members agreed that housing should not be seen in
isolation and could act as an economic regenerator.
So far as Scottish Homes's three-year plan was concerned, there was
''considerable cause for concern'' over figures in it which showed its
development funding was expected to fall from #320m to #307m by 1997.
To do anything of lasting value that improved the quality of the
housing stock needed increased investment, not cutbacks, he said.

SCOTLAND is to appoint its first professor in gender relations, it was
announced yesterday.
The professor will have the task of discovering why the success of
women in education is not reflected in their posts in industry.
Dundee University is to make the appointment to research gender issues
in education and employment. The chair will be funded by AT&amp;T Global
Information Solutions (Scotland) Ltd who will provide #300,000 over five
years.
Topics to be tackled by the new chair, which is open to both male and
female applicants, include the decline in the proportion of women in
management and the predominance of men in science and technology.
AT&amp;T, which produces automated bank teller machines, hopes to benefit
from the research.
Dr Jim Adamson, vice-president of the firm, said: ''It is vital to our
business and our global competitiveness that we can draw on the best
human resources available and it would be folly if we were to ignore a
sector of the population.
''Our inability in the UK to draw women into engineering and
management careers is of particular concern and relevance to AT&amp;T's
business and the university's research work into this issue will be of
undoubted value to the company.''
The chair will be based in the Centre for Continuing Education, which
is headed by one of Dundee University's women professors, Mrs Elisabeth
Gerver.
She said: ''There are five chairs of women's studies and one chair of
gender studies in the UK. But, so far, research into gender relations
has lacked overall academic leadership in Scotland.''
She added: ''Amongst many important issues, I hope that the new
professor will help us to understand more fully why females in Scotland
now outperform males in many areas of education but remain seriously
under-represented in decision making.''
It is hoped the new position will be taken up by the autumn.
An apple tree was planted in the university grounds to mark
yesterday's announcement.
The appointment follows a long tradition of equal opportunities at the
university. One founder of the university Miss Mary Baxter, insisted on
equal education for both sexes in 1881 and women graduates of the
University College of Dundee were the first in Scotland to be granted
degrees.
The first woman professor to hold a chair in Scotland, Margaret
Fairlie, was apppointed to her position in obstetrics and gynaecology at
Dundee in 1940.

GRACE Rennick was something of a glittering pupil at Glasgow's
Hutcheson's Grammar School. Consequently, she was marked out as
university material and, in 1921, became a scholar of languages and
botany.
Yesterday, one of the University of Glasgow's oldest graduates was
back on campus recalling her student days as the university celebrates
the 100th anniversary of the graduation of its first female students.
With obvious pride, 92-year-old Mrs Rennick sat in one of the
university's courtyards and showed off her well-preserved collection of
hard-backed text books, each neatly dated and signed.
She told how, as a middle-class girl with a good academic record, she
had encountered some opposition to her higher education aspirations from
her father. Considerably older than her mother, he was, she said, of the
generation which saw little point in a woman acquiring a degree.
However, after he was cajoled by her headteacher, Mrs Rennick -- then
Grace Hill -- began her studies in French, Italian, English, and botany.
''In my first year we were not allowed to take English, as those who
had returned from the First World War had first choice.''
As for many other so-called ''blue stockings'' a degree led to a
career. But a career, in Mrs Rennick's case as a teacher, meant a woman
could not marry. In 1930, she became a wife and later a mother, and only
returned to teaching during the Second World War.
The university's deputy archivist, Ms Lesley Richmond, said that 51%
of the university's students were now women, a marked contrast to the 6%
enrolled 100 years ago. She said the two world wars gave women an
opportunity to study, but numbers fell to less than a quarter in the
1930s and 1950s.
The celebrations over the weekend include a Victorian market featuring
the craft work of local women artists, and an exhibition detailing the
history of women at the university.

<HEADLINE>Locals 'plotted to oust family'</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978780433</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A NEIGHBOUR of a family who have lost an appeal against eviction from
their home in the Loch Ness village of Foyers has organised a petition
claiming there was a plot against them.
Mrs Sandra Allan, 30, claimed the plot was organised by a group, who
are all related or long-term friends, in an bid to oust Mr Robert
Foster, 33, a gardener, his wife, Joan, 36, and their five children.
She will send the petition to Mr Peter Loutit, Housing Director of
Inverness District Council, and hopes he will not force the eviction of
the family from their semi-detached council house.
Mrs Allan, who lives four doors away from the Fosters in Riverside,
Foyers, said: ''That the Fosters did all the terrible things they are
meant to have done is more in doubt than the existence of Nessie in the
loch on our doorstep. They have been given a raw deal.''
She added: ''I was urged to join in the move to oust the Fosters by
complaining to the council but refused. I've never had any trouble from
them and neither have a lot of people in the village.
''This is not a wild place despite the picture painted of Foyers. The
Fosters younger kids are all in bed by 9pm. My own children play with
them as well as those of the complainers.''
When ordering the eviction, after hearing evidence from local
witnesses, Sheriff James Fraser at Inverness said that the village had
been a peaceful place until the Fosters moved there in 1991 ''then all
hell broke loose.''
He described the children as ''monsters'' after hearing claims that
they bullied and attacked other children, including a youngster they
knew had undergone open heart surgery.
They were also said to have dangled another child by his ankles from a
bridge.
The parents were also alleged to have brought a reign of terror to the
village with violent outbursts.
However, Elizabeth Fraser, who lives next door to the Fosters,
yesterday said: ''The kids are very tidy and don't even throw a sweetie
paper over the fence. I never hear a sound from them. Their dad cuts my
grass.
''It looks like there has been a bit of spite at work. A little give
and take would have sorted things out at the start.
''I feel sympathy for them, I wouldn't like it on my conscience them
being put out of their house.''
Local resident, Mr Angus MacGruer, of Clubfield House, Foyers, added:
''The bairns have never bothered me. I have never found then cheeky or
doing any harm. They stop for a blether on their way to fish.''
Another local man said: ''There is a fair bit of support for the
family. Many villagers don't want to see the kids losing their home.''
However, Mr Loutit, said: ''I'm not throwing the Fosters a lifeline
over this and I am not backtracking.
''But, given that we first started legal action against this family
away back in 1992, the circumstances will have to be re-examined. Maybe
they have changed, maybe they have not. I will need to discuss the
matter with the housing committee.''
Mr Foster said: ''My children are no worse behaved than any others in
the village. The children they are meant to have bullied are all older
than them.
''The ringleader of the move against us has a relative who wanted our
four-bedroom house but the council allocated it to us instead.
''I don't where we would go if we were evicted. It would be terrible
for us all.''

<TEXT>
A TEENAGE girl was terrified by a man, said to be infatuated with her,
who persistently shadowed her movements.
Paisley Sheriff Court heard that William Laing Shand, 30, had waited
on street corners for the 16-year-old to leave her home and workplace.
He would then follow her to work and loiter outside until she
re-appeared, then he would follow her back to her home.
Even when she changed her route, Shand continued to stalk the
teenager.
The court heard how Shand, who admitted previous convictions, had
earlier been sentenced to 100-hours of community service. The court was
told that Shand had been branded ''the beast'' by other offenders who
knew of his background, and had been assaulted by them.
The community service officer in charge of his case had then sent
Shand back to court to have the order revoked. Shand was then placed on
probation instead.
Shand, of Buchanan Street, Johnstone, Renfrewshire, pleaded guilty
yesterday to placing his victim in a state of fear and alarm by
persistently following her between February 21 and March 8 this year.
The girl was said to have been so frightened by his behaviour that she
decided to tell her grandmother and an aunt about it. The following
morning, as she went to work, she saw Shand staring at her again, and
again he followed her to her workplace. She was so distressed that
police were called in to question Shand.
When cautioned, Shand admitted following the teenager. He said: ''I
only wanted to ask her out on a date.''
The court was told Shand had behaved in a similar fashion in a number
of previous incidents involving other girls.
Defence agent, Mr John McElroy, said Shand regretted his actions which
had caused a great deal of concern. A psychiatric report ordered by the
court had shown no mental illness to explain Shand's conduct.
However the court was told that Shand had a drink problem, and
required counselling for this.
Sheriff Kenneth John Ross refused to alter the conditions of the
probation order to require Shand to attend alcohol abuse counselling,
but warned Shand that he would find himself in serious trouble if he did
not change his ways.
Fining Shand #200, payable at #10 per fortnight, Sheriff Ross told
him: ''You have been a persistent offender over the last few years with
a list of irritating offences which have upset the ladies involved
greatly.
''You had better sort yourself out.''

THE SCOTTISH Secondary Teachers' Association yesterday voiced its
concern over structural problems at a Central region school.
The SSTA said structural problems at Bo'ness Academy, which has 950
pupils, had been first noticed as far back as 1977, three years after
the school opened.
SSTA vice-president Barbara Clark, a teacher at Bo'ness, said: ''The
building is fundamentally unsafe and the problems have been allowed to
continue for far too long. Our pupils deserve to be taught in a building
which is safe and appropriate to a high standard of education.''
Details of the technical and structural difficulties at the
21-year-old school were outlined in a report by engineers Woolgar
Hunter, called in by Central region.
It showed concrete had lost up to 50% of its strength, floors could
not pass loading tests and supporting pillars were so thin that samples
could not be taken.
Next Wednesday the council's education committee will consider three
recommendations: to strengthen the existing building; build a new school
on the existing site; or build a new school nearby.
The council pointed out that there is no immediate danger. It is
likely to press for a new #4.6m school with Scottish Office backing.

''THE first casualty of war is truth,'' someone wisely said. Where
politics is concerned, truth is a perpetual victim.
Yesterday's exchanges between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the
Opposition somewhat resembled an argument between two schoolboys about
who had told the biggest lies or, as a Conservative Central Office
hand-out yesterday preferred to say, ''whoppers''.
As often happens in such youthful squabbles, there was some dispute
about ''who started it''. The Tories said it was the previous night's
Labour Party political broadcast. Labour said it was Mr Major's promise
just before the last election not to raise taxes. It simply had reminded
the nation that taxes had, in fact, gone up.
Mr David Evenett (Erith and Crayford -- Con.) invited the Prime
Minister to join him in condemning this ''deplorable use of television
to mislead the public'', appearing to indicate that prior to this
broadcast nothing but simple, undiluted truth had ever emerged from the
box.
Mr Major admitted he had been unable to settle down with Norma in
front of the Downing Street set to watch himself being called a liar to
the audience of masochists who had not switched to another channel. He
had been ''much better occupied meeting local authority health chairmen
to discuss the success of our health reforms''.
One had a second or so to wonder if that meeting had actually gone
quite as smoothly as Mr Major's words implied. ''Wonderful success,
Prime Minister. Don't know where all these stories about patients on
trolleys come from. We must have some more reforms. Virginia is
absolutely wonderful.'' The Sketch wasn't there, so we don't know. One
wondered though.
Mr Major said there were a number of ''inaccuracies'' in the
broadcast. In the course of his savage little clash with Mr Blair, he
moved through the gears and the ''inaccuracies'' became ''blatant
untruths'', ''peddling untruths'' and ''gutter politics''.
It is not for the Sketch to adjudicate; the voters can do that. But
one noticed that Mr Major preferred to attack the Labour claims on
council tax and whether the Government had made cuts in health,
education and law and order. Tory councils were cheaper band for band
and spending had gone up, not down.
Mr Blair preferred to ask about tax increases. Was not the average
family now #800 a year worse off? ''True or false? Yes or no?'' he
barked.
Mr Major replied: ''What we really saw last night was that behind the
high-flown language of New Labour lies the gutter politics of Old
Labour. Now, was that a Yes or a No? The Sketch thought it was a Yes
dressed up to sound like a No.
What about, said Mr Blair, the specific pledge days before the
election that VAT would not be extended only for it to be extended to
domestic fuel in the very next Budget?
Labour had warned it would happen. Who told the truth then?
Mr Major replied that on matters of fact -- one felt these might be
about education, health etc -- Mr Blair and his colleagues had told
''untruths''. He had set out before the last election that he wanted to
see taxes reduced. He still did and ''when it is prudent to do so we
will return to tax- cutting.''
This also had to be marked as a disguised Yes especially as what he
did actually say to an election press conference was: ''We will be able
to make a series of reductions in direct taxation'' and, before Central
Office write, we know there is still time. The words were hardly
calculated though, to apprise the careless listener of the possibilty
that before coming down they might have to go up.
Assuming that Labour got some of its spending statistics wrong, are we
to take this spat as another illustration of the truth of the popular
belief that politicians are liars anyway?
Bearing in mind that one should not necessarily believe everything one
reads in newspapers, the Sketch is reluctant to reach so stark a
conclusion. Someone wrote ''a wise scepticism is the first attribute of
a good critic.'' It is also a useful attribute for a canny voter.

<HEADLINE>Risk of rock falls forces nursery move. Fears for children at Wallace Monument</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>DUNCAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978780437</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A CHILDREN'S nursery in Stirling is to be relocated because of the
risk of rock falls from the 300ft-high Abbey Craig on which the Wallace
Monument stands.
There is no danger, however, to the monument itself.
Consultants were called in by Stirling District Council after some
boulders broke free in November last year.
The council has now received an initial report which warns of ''very
serious consequences'' if a similar rock fall were to happen in the area
behind the private Acre Wood nursery in the town's Alloa Road. It also
discovered 33 dangerous areas on the Craig.
Proprietor and manager, Mrs Catherine Ritchie, yesterday held
discussions with council officials about relocating the nursery
temporarily while steps were taken to stabilise the rock.
Mr Bob Calvert, the council's leisure manager, said the first part of
the consultants' report ''identifies a number of areas on the Craig
which may be susceptible to further rock falls in the future.
''One of these areas is directly behind Acre Wood nursery and we have
asked our consultants to concentrate on this and find out what effective
stabilising measures can be taken. They will be reporting back to us on
this in the middle of May.''
The risk of further rock falls was no greater that it had been in the
past, he added. But if the nursery management decided it would be best
to move until the area had been stabilised, the council would do all it
could to help find temporary accommodation.
Mrs Ritchie said later: ''No responsible person could run a nursery
for 68 children beneath a hillside now classed as a potential high-risk
hazard.''
The council commissioned the consultants' report after two large
boulders broke free. One flattened a bus stop, narrowly missing a woman,
and the other bounced across the main Alloa-Stirling road before
crashing through a garden wall. The incident took place several hundred
yards from the nursery.
Mrs Ritchie said yesterday that when she had made inquiries after that
incident, she had been told that the area close to the nursery was
low-risk. But she had informed parents at the time that the council was
commissioning a report to assess the extent of the problem.
In their report, the consultants pinpointed 33 high-hazard areas on
the Craig which presented a danger to road users, children in the
nursery, property, and people using the woods beneath the monument.
''If a failure of the scale occurring in November, 1994, were to occur
behind the nursery, then the consequences could be very serious,'' said
the consultants.
They added that it was almost impossible to be precise regarding the
timing of a given failure or how many would occur in a given year.
''What is certain is that failures will occur . . . They do represent a
serious hazard to life and property.''
Parents had been informed immediately of the developments, Mrs Ritchie
said. ''Everyone agreed it would be better to relocate the nursery until
the remedial works were completed and the council gave some assurance
that the hazards were sorted.
''A new building has been located and the appropriate bodies have
given provisional acceptance and we will be moving into the building
shortly. All the authorities have been extremely helpful, including the
council who are doing everything in their powers to assist.''
She hoped the long-term future of the nursery on its present location
would be assured with the works planned by the council.
''We are, of course, very upset at having this move thrust upon us at
such short notice and hope it will be only a couple of months before we
can return to our nursery. However, the safety of the children in our
care is paramount and we must avoid any potential chance, no matter how
slight it may be perceived.''
She thanked parents for their understanding and support, and added
that only one parent had removed their child until the move.
Council officials said there was no threat to the future of the
220ft-high Wallace Monument, built in 1859-69 in memory of Scots hero
Sir William Wallace.
A spokesman said: ''There is no risk to the monument. We are talking
about loose rock, not the structure of the Craig itself.''
The land around the Craig is leased by the council from the
landowners, the Cowane's Trust.

THE ORDEAL for an engineer from Lewis, captured six months ago by
rebels in Sierra Leone, ended yesterday when he was one of 16 hostages
released.
There are hopes that he may be reunited with his family this weekend.
Mr Calum Murray was working as a road-builder for Voluntary Services
Overseas when he was taken with another British VSO volunteer last
November.
He was among six Britons freed with the help of the Red Cross. The
other hostages were Swiss, German, and Sierra Leone nationals.
Mr Murray's brother Iain, 27, a teacher, said last night: ''Everyone
is delighted that Calum will be home soon, safe and well, and that he is
coming in one piece. We first heard about 3.15pm from VSO that the
hostages had been released by the Revolutionary United Front.
He added: ''Calum is being taken to the capital in neighbouring
Guinea. We do not know when he will be home but we hope it will be this
weekend. If he gets a plane on Saturday he could be back in the UK right
away, but if that does not happen it could be Monday before he gets
away.
''I plan to meet him in London. I think there will be a big party when
he and his companion, Robert D'Cruz, get back to the UK. Our family
would like to thank everyone for their prayers and support during the
past six months. But Calum is very shy and I would be very surprised if
he wants any publicity.''
VSO Director David Green said he was delighted Mr Murray and Mr
D'Cruz, a Londoner, were now safe. ''I know that their families and
friends are overjoyed that their ordeal is over. Everyone has worked so
hard to bring the hostages home. This is the very best of news,'' he
said.
Mr Tony Baldry, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affiars, said: ''We are extremely grateful to the
International Committee of the Red Cross for using their humanitarian
influence to help achieve their release and also to the Government of
Sierra Leone and Guinea for their assistance.''
Mr Murray is from Gress, Lewis, where his mother, Mrs Katie Ann
Murray, is the local postmistress. He has two brothers, Iain and Norman,
and a sister Karen. His father, Norman, died more than a year ago.
Mr Murray and Mr D'Cruz were seized on November 7 in an attack on the
northern town of Kabala. Two other Britons, James Westwood and Ross
Milne, were seized in an attack on a mine site on January 18. A further
two Britons, Peter White and Andrew Young, were captured in an attack on
another mine.
At the time of his capture, Iain Murray said of his brother: ''He is
quiet but has an inner strength. I think he will manage.''
The rebels had threatened to begin killing hostages unless foreign
governments stopped providing aid to Sierra Leone's military government.
An estimated 5000 people have died in Sierra Leone's war and in recent
months several foreigners working on engineering projects or in mines in
the country have been abducted.
During his captivity, Mr Murray was allowed to speak to VSO officials
by radio. He told them he missed his family, but was otherwise bearing
up well.
Mr Murray joined the VSO last August and Sierra Leone was his first
posting.
He became a civil engineer after graduating from Strathclyde
University in 1990 and worked for Shanks and McEwan in Dundee and
Kirkcaldy before joining VSO -- ''something he always wanted to do, use
his skills to help others,'' according to his brother Iain.
The decision by the rebels to release the hostages came after ''a
long, drawn out process'', according to a Red Cross spokesman.
In Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, a military spokesman said
the hostages had been released in the Kailahun district, which is near
the border with Guinea. They were being taken overland to Conakry in
Guinea by the Red Cross.
A number of Sierra Leoneans are still thought to be captive, but all
foreigners have been freed.

THE Cabinet yesterday accepted that the Government should not try to
overturn a Lords vote which would ensure that war widows who lose their
second husband through death or divorce have their #140-a-week pension
restored.
Commons Leader Tony Newton told an MP who backed the Lords decision
that he expected a statement by Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley
on Monday --when the Bill comes before the Commons -- would be welcome
to him.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke argued that the #40m cost of the concession
would narrow his scope for tax cuts in future Budgets.
However, the Prime Minister supported those Ministers who believed
that in the run-up to next month's VE Day celebrations it would be
difficult to try to prevent the pension reinstatement.
The Cabinet also was told that a number of Tory back benchers probably
would refuse to support the Government if it did, making defeat likely.
The pension lapses when a war widow remarries or her husband dies, and
under current rules is not resinstated if she is again on her own.
The Department of Social Security estimates that 90,000 war widows
have remarried since 1939, about 80% before 1955. With most of the
widows over 70, the cost will be a declining burden on the Treasury..
More than 240 MPs of all parties have signed a Commons motion calling
for war widows to receive a pension for life regardless of whether they
remarry or not.

MYSTERY still surrounds the death of a seaman who disappeared from his
vessel at Aberdeen harbour after celebrating New Year.
Wladyslaw Demiczew, 47, of Lowestoft, Suffolk, was the leading hand
onthe offshore supply vessel Jane Viking, berthed at Seabase, Waterloo
Quay, and went missing while acting as nightwatchman on January 1.
His body was found a month later in the water at nearby Albert Quay, a
fatal accident inquiry at Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard yesterday.
The precise cause of death could not be established, but it was
presumed that he had drowned.
He had earlier been escorted across the gangway in a ''very drunk
state'' on to his vessel after celebrating New Year with colleagues.
But as Sheriff David Kelbie returned a formal verdict, he said it was
not possible to say with any confidence that drink had been a
contributing factor to Mr Demiczew's death.
A search of the vessel after she sailed revealed that he was missing.
Mr Demiczew, described as a ''model employee'', was identified through
dental records and from tattoos.
A post-mortem examination revealed that he had been substantially
under the influence of alcohol and would have been unsteady on his feet
and once in the water would have been vulnerable to drowning.
Chief Officer Mr Christopher Brakenberry, 40, from Yorkshire, told the
inquiry that he had been duty officer on the night in question and had
told Mr Demiczew he could have a drink.
He said he had seen him drinking with others in the second mate's
cabin that night and when he later found him in the messroom of the
adjacent vessel drinking with other, he told him to return to his own
boat.
Mr Brakenberry said that when he had later seen Mr Demiczew at about
4.45am, he seemed all right.

<TEXT>
HOME Secretary Michael Howard yesterday voiced approval for a
tough-regime project in Scotland run by former paratroopers and marines
aimed at stopping young criminals from reoffending.
The scheme, Airborne Initiative at West Linton, Peebleshire, showed
signs ''of being a promising development in the treatment of young
offenders'', Mr Howard told the Commons.
His comments came as the Home Office considers introducing US-style
''boot camps'' for young offenders.
Tory Anthony Coombs (Wyre Forest) told the Home Secretary: ''What most
people want to see in this country for young offenders is not only
rehabilitation but appropriate punishment which acts as a deterrent.''
Mr Coombs urged him to look at the Airborne Initiative scheme ''which
is handled by former special forces people and former marines and
paratroopers, which has a 100% record of ensuring that people don't
reoffend, of those who who successfully complete that course''.
Mr Howard replied: ''I entirely agree with you.''
He said Home Office Minister of State Michael Forsyth was examining
the scheme very closely.
Mr George Howarth, for Labour, said Mr Howard was ''talking tough but
acting ineffectively.''
To Tory cheers, Mr Howard retorted: ''It's certainly not. But it's not
surprising to anyone on this side of the House that any mention of any
discipline for young offenders has those on the other side running a
mile, as we have just seen from you.''

TWO Tory MPs last night were suspended from the Commons over the
so-called ''cash-for-questions'' affair.
In the toughest action for decades, MPs backed -- without a vote -- a
Privileges Committee report recommending the suspension of Mr David
Tredinnick (Bosworth) for 20 days and Mr Mr Graham Riddick (Colne
Valley) for 10.
The two MPs earlier had apologised for their actions and left the
Chamber for the Commons to decide their fate.
It is understood Mr Tredinnick will lose about #1800 in pay and Mr
Ridddick about #900. Both men already have been forced to resign their
positions as unpaid Parliamentary Private Secretaries.
The suspensions deal a new blow to John Major's already weak hold on
the Commons.
The Government is now in a minority of seven in the House with the
temporary loss of the two MPs added to the toll taken by the expulsion
of eight Euro rebels, the resignation from the party whip of a ninth and
the death of Sir Nicholas Fairbairn (Perth and Kinross).
Labour has indicated that it intends to exploit the situation with a
debate on London hospital closures -- which have angered many Tories
with seats in the capital -- in the hope of inflicting a defeat.
The Commons acted amid mounting disquiet about sleaze and ahead of the
Nolan committee's report and recommendations on maintaining standards in
public life.
The allegation against the MPs was that they had been prepared to take
#1000 for tabling Commons questions when approached by undercover
reporters from the Sunday Times.
In his statement to the House, Mr Tredinnick said: ''I fully accept
that I did not evaluate fully or correctly the proposition that was made
to me. It is a matter of very considerable regret to me that I should
have done anything that could have damaged the reputation of this House
or caused concern in my constituency, which I am proud to represent.
''I hope all members of this House recognise that I very much regret
my error and I hope Members will be able to accept my sincere
apologies.''
Mr Riddick said: ''The committee of priveleges has criticised me for
making a serious error of judgement. Last July I accepted that I had
made an error of judgement and I apologised to the House. I willingly
repeat that apology once again to the Commons this afternoon.''
He said he had tried to behave according to the standards expected by
deciding within 24 hours not to accept any payment and apologising
immediately to the Commons.
Mr Riddick said: ''If the House feels those endeavours failed in any
respect, I can do no more than express my deep regrets to the House.''
He promised to re-dedicate himself to the service of his constituents in
the years ahead.
After an investigation behind closed doors, the Privileges Committee
report judged the MPs' conduct to have fallen ''below the standards of
the House''.However, the Sunday Times also was reprimanded by the
committee.
Leader of the House and chairman of the Privileges Committee Mr Tony
Newton said: ''The reputation of the House has inescapably been damaged.
''We all want to do what we can to help restore it. I believe the most
effective step we can take today towards restoring it is for the House
to accept, without variation, the unanimous report which the committee
has produced.''
Labour's Shadow Leader of the House Mrs Ann Taylor, said: ''It is
essential if standards of propriety are to be maintained -- and in the
current climate some would say re-established -- that we make it clear
not only to Members of this House but also the public outside, that
certain types of behaviour are unacceptable and such behaviour must and
will carry sanctions by this House.
''The action of a couple of Members has undermined the reputation of
us all.''
Some Labour back benchers criticised the penalty as too lenient and
called for the expulsion of both MPs, but some Tory MPs said the action
being taken was too harsh,
There was in particular sympathy for Mr Riddick, with 158 Tory MPs,
including a number of Ministers, signing a letter to his constituency
chairman expressing confidence in his reputation for honesty and
integrity.
Mr Riddick said later: ''I am deeply grateful to those friends of mine
who have organised this letter and to my colleagues for having signed
it.''
Tory MPs were also critical of the Sunday Times's methods.
Mr Michael Alison (Selby) said the newspaper undertook ''an elaborate,
deliberate and technically adroit conspiracy to deceive Mr Tredinnick,''
Senior backbencher Sir Cranley Onslow said: ''I find it regrettable to
a degree that this respectable newspaper should have brought a stinking
mess to the door of the House of Commons and refused to help the
Privileges Committee to clear it up.''
Veteran Labour leftwinger Tony Benn -- who was removed from the
Privileges Committee because he insisted on publishing accounts of its
private sessions on the cash-for-questions affair -- dismissed the
proceedings as the ''most ghastly whitewash and cover-up of the real
question,'' which was what standards should be imposed on MPs.
Mr Kevin Barron (Rother Valley -- Lab.) said both MPs should be
expelled to face the judgment of their voters.
Mr David Evans (Welwyn and Hatfield -- Con.) said Mr Riddick had
returned the cheque on the day he received it.
To Tory cheers, Mr Evans declared: ''In my opinion he acted as
honourably as he could after he discovered he had made an error of
judgment.''
Mr Dale Campbell-Savours (Workington) said: ''If it had not have been
for the Sunday Times, the truth would not have come out. Let there be no
doubt about that.
''What we are talking about here is conduct by Members common to
perhaps over 100 other Members of the House of Commons.''

QUEEN'S Awards have been won by 16 Scottish companies producing a wide
range of goods, including the kitchen sink.
They are among the recipients of 163 awards for Environmental,
Technological and Export Achievement for 1995, announced today.
United Distillers, based in Edinburgh, wins an Award for Environmental
Achievement, of only six announced, for its part in the development of a
lightweight bottle which uses between 20 and 25% less glass. Less energy
is used in its manufacture and it requires less packaging material.
The company gains the award jointly with Hertfordshire firm United
Glass, one of its major suppliers, which has a base at Alloa.
An Award for Technological Achievement goes to Underwater Excavation
of Portlethen, near Aberdeen, for a sensitive underwater excavation
system.
The 14 Scottish companies receiving export awards include Carron
Phoenix of Falkirk, which manufactures stainless steel and synthetic
sink tops. Part of a Swiss multinational, its exports have grown from
30% to 60% of its overall production in the past two years.
Another Falkirk-based operation, Carron Bathrooms, has also won an
export award. It manufactures acrylic baths, shower trays and sinks.
There is also recognition for export achievements in Scotland's
financial sector with Baillie Gifford Overseas, an Edinburgh-based
investment manager, being rewarded for its success in attracting clients
outside the UK.
Another export success is Caledonian Paper, of Irvine. Part of a
Finnish group, it exports 100,000 tonnes of its Clydecote
lightweight-coated magazine paper every year to the US, EU, and South
and East Asia.
Winning its sixth export award is Ethicon, the Edinburgh-based
manufacturer of surgical sutures and specialist wound repair products. A
subsidiary of the US Johnson and Johnson company, Ethicon increased
exports by 50% in the three years to September, 1994.
The Queen has this year granted a total of six environmental, 17
technological and a record 140 export awards.
Mr Ian Lang, Secretary of State for Scotland, commented: ''I am
delighted that Scottish companies are continuing to sustain a committed
and professional attitude to exporting. The winners of this year's
Export Achievement Awards are to be commended on an excellent
performance and for helping to ensure that Scottish industry continues
to break export records.''
Other Scottish-based companies winning export awards are:
* AT &amp; T Global Information Solutions (Scotland), of Dundee. The
American-owned company designs and manufactures automated teller
machines and other self-service terminals. Its exports have more than
doubled in the past three years.
* Prestwick-based Aviall, trading as Aviall Caledonian Engine
Services. Its export earnings, which account for a very significant and
growing proportion of turnover, derive from the repair and overhaul of
gas turbine aero engines.
* The Chivas and Glenlivet Group, of Paisley, is the operating
division of the Canadian-owned Seagram Distillers and exports mainly
Scotch but also gin and rum. Its exports have increased 70% over the
past six years.
* Sausage skin manufacturers Devro, whose huge empire has its HQ at
Moodiesburn, Glasgow.
* Diamond Power Speciality, of Dumbarton, now a subsidiary of
McDermott International of the US. It makes cleaning systems for boilers
and heat exchangers.
* Motorola's European Cellular Subscriber Division, based at Bathgate.
It exports cellular telephones to more than 60 countries and has
expanded from greenfield site to plant employing 2300 workers in less
than five years.
* Polaroid (UK), of Dumbarton.
* Shield Diagnostics, of Dundee, manufactures in vitro medical
diagnostic kits for auto-immune infectious diseases, microbiology and
cardiovascular diseases. Quadrupled its exports in the period 1991-94.
* TRAK Microwave, of Dundee, a small subsidiary of the Tech-Sym
Corporation of the US, produces a wide range of ferrite microwave
components and subsystems used by the telecommunications, aerospace, and
industrial and medical electronics industries.

ONE of Scotland's best known mountaineers said last night he was
''saddened'' to hear of the professional difficulties of a climbing
colleague.
Mr Hamish MacInnes said architect James R Marshall -- who The Herald
yesterday revealed had been expelled from the Royal Incorporation of
Architects in Scotland, following a 19-month investigation -- was one of
the greatest mountaineers of his generation.
He added that he had been rescued by Mr Marshall after he had become
trapped on Raven's Gully on Buachaill Etive Mor.
On hearing the news Mr MacInnes said that he was saddened as he knew
Mr Marshall had been a competent architect.
Mr McInnes said: ''Jimmy is one of the true great climbers. He was up
there with people like Robin Smith and John Cunningham. He never went
for publicity for his climbing but, among us, he was always looked on as
one of the greats.
''I remember when I was trying the first ascent of Raven's Gully in
February, 1953. I got stuck close to the top and was dangling from my
ice-axe. Jimmy and a few of his friends came over from another part of
the mountain and pulled me to safety.
''I will always be indebted to him for that. I always knew he was a
competent architect, and it makes me unhappy to hear of his problem.''
Mr Marshall's climbing exploits were renowned all over the country. In
1960, he made six new routes up Ben Nevis in six days.

MINISTERS are working on the final details of controversial proposals
to sell off the nuclear power industry.
However, a firm decision to go ahead with the #2bn privatisation will
not go before the full Cabinet until a series of safety and regulatory
hurdles have been overcome.
Sources in Whitehall confirmed that a Cabinet sub-committee on
Wednesday set in motion technical preparations to pave the way for the
sale of Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear.
Labour yesterday expressed outrage at the move, which, it said, flew
in the face of public opinion.
Shadow Industry Minister Brian Wilson said: ''Nuclear privatisation is
unwanted and will be seen as the makings of another massive rip-off of
taxpayers, who will be left with the bill for decommissioning all the
outdated Magnox reactors.
''The overwhelming majority in this country would recognise public
ownership rather than the private profit motive as being the best
guarantee of the safest possible operation of nuclear power stations.''

ABERDEEN District seems set to give a major financial boost to
employees who cycle to their work.
The personnel committee is recommending that the cyclists' mileage
allowance should be raised by 30%, in a bold move that could cost the
council as much as an additional 9p a year.
Only one of the council's 3000 workers has claimed a cyclist's mileage
allowance in the past two years -- and he averages three miles per
annum.
''Last year I claimed for a trip to Kittybrewster,'' said accounts
assistant Mr Michael Scroggie. ''One-and-a-half miles there and
one-and-a-half miles back.
''Maybe I am the only person with enough brass neck to claim, but I do
so on a point of principle. I am delighted that the rate is being
raised.
''I cycle for health and fitness and for environmental reasons and I
think that, if the rate were raised to the same as car-users receive
(between 50.2p and 72.9p depending on the car's cc) instead of a measly
10p, it would encourage more people to cycle.''
Mr Scroggie, 30, cycles to work every day, rain or shine, but
confessed that in inclement weather he takes the bus to business
meetings. ''It doesn't really look very good if you turn up at a meeting
with black blobs all over your face or a wet bottom,'' he said.
* Meanwhile, members of the new Edinburgh City Council will not be
flying first class on overseas trips, the authority's new leader
pledged, writes Lynne Robertson.
Councillor Keith Geddes, the Labour leader of the new shadow
authority, made the promise at a meeting of the council's executive
committee.
A row had flared earlier this week when it was revealed a report
prepared by officials had recommended first-class travel for rail and
air trips, which could have tripled travel costs on some journeys
abroad.
The report led to a complaint by the administration's Conservative
Leader, Councillor Daphne Sleigh, who claimed it was improper for
councillors to travel first class at a time of budget cuts.
Committee members yesterday approved an amended report, which said
members must travel by the cheapest route available.
The committee also agreed that the basic allowance for city
councillors would be #5915 per year.

PRINCE Charles was caught in the crossfire of a local dispute
yesterday as he arrived in Glasgow to open a leisure centre.
Children singing and waving placards lined streets outside the #6.5m
Scotstoun Leisure Centre, and one of Scotland's most senior Labour
members, Councillor Jean McFadden, boycotted the event in protest.
The furore was over a decision by Glasgow District Council's parks and
recreation department to cut training hours for the Whiteinch Amateur
Swimming Club.
The club, which is one of Glasgow's oldest and provides lessons solely
for children, will move to the new leisure centre in two weeks when
Whiteinch Pool closes. However, parks department officials have
allocated only three hours a week for training, and two of those are
after 9pm.
Club president Mr David Heppell criticised the council's ''broken
promises'' and said his members had been left high and dry. ''Late-night
slots are totally inappropriate for a club with swimmers as young as
six,'' he said.
Mr Heppell added that the demonstration was aimed not at the Prince
but at Mr Bernard Connolly, the council's parks director. ''He is well
aware of the feeling in the community about the way the club has been
treated. It has been very shabby.''
Councillor McFadden, a former leader of Glasgow District Council and
member for Scotstoun, said she was furious that Mr Connolly had ignored
her letters on the issue.
''I'm really very disappointed in the way the local swimming club has
been treated. I fought very hard to get the new leisure centre built in
Scotstoun, but I didn't think local clubs would be penalised. I intended
to attend the opening, but I decided I wasn't going to walk through a
picket of my own people.''
Mr Connolly could not be contacted for comment yesterday, but
Glasgow's convener of parks and recreation, Councillor Colin McNicol,
said the swimming club's situation would be reviewed in a few months.
''I didn't see any protesters and I have no idea why Mrs McFadden
didn't come,'' he said. ''The swimming club know the situation and have
been given all the information. The club wanted the same hours as they
had at Whiteinch, and that's not possible at the moment.''
Prince Charles waved at the protesters as he arrived and toured the
leisure complex, which houses Scotland's largest indoor tennis centre.
During yesterday's visit to the city the Prince also played a role
normally associated with his wife, as he laughed and joked with patients
in the hospice that was Glasgow's wedding gift to the couple.
His visit to the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice was to say
farewell to Dr Anne Gilmore, the outgoing chief executive and founder,
but he found time to chat with terminally-ill patients.
He laughed as great-grandmother Mrs Flora Groat, 89, told him: ''I'm
saving up all my pain until after you've gone.'' Mrs Groat, from
Clarkston, told the Prince of her delight at the birth of her
great-grandaughter, Lucy Anne Cook, two weeks ago.
The Prince also discussed poetry with another patient, Mrs Philomena
Macdonald, 62. As she showed him a book of her poems, Song Unbroken, he
told her of how impressed he had been by a Dylan Thomas exhibition he
had recently visited in Wales.
Mrs Macdonald's poetry, written after she contracted motor neurone
disease, was published on her behalf by friends, with proceeds going to
charity. It has just gone into a second print.
The hospice, Glasgow's first, was founded in 1980 by Dr Gilmore and
moved to its present site at Carlton Place in 1983. After 15 years as
chief executive Dr Gilmore is stepping down to pursue a new career as a
psychoanalyst. The Prince presented her with a portrait of herself at a
reception of more than 200 supporters and benefactors of the hospice.
Dr Gilmore said: ''The hospice has been a large part of my life for 15
years, but it is time to move on. I am, however, delighted to be given
this opportunity to welcome the prince back to the hospice and say my
farewells directly.''
Dr Gilmore's efforts and the work of all the hospice staff were
praised by the prince, who said: ''I know how much loving care and
attention is expended on all the patients.''

<RECORDNO>978780460</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
THE ending of national pay bargaining in the NHS will leave health
workers in rural parts of Scotland worse off, Scottish Nationalist
parliamentary leader Margaret Ewing warned last night.
However, Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton called
on nurses, midwives and health visitors to take part in the local
negotiations ''to secure pay settlements which are both entirely fair to
them and affordable to their employers''.
During a short Commons debate on the issue, Mrs Ewing condemned the
Government policy of leaving local NHS trusts to make their own pay
deals, insisting health workers were equally valuable wherever they
worked.
''This policy will pit trust against trust and nurse against nurse,''
she warned.
Mrs Ewing claimed the policy was not working, with only four of the 46
trusts in Scotland making pay awards so far, two of them conditionally.
She said rural constituencies like her Moray seat would lose out if
national pay bargaining ceased.
''We cannot have a situation where low wages are paid in rural
areas.''
Demanding the trusts should make clear what they were offering staff,
Mrs Ewing said: ''People involved in the health service are more
interested in knowing the colour of the money that is to be offered by a
trust than the colour of the BMWs which are driven by the administrators
and all the managers that are not involved in the delivery of its
service.''
Replying, Lord James said responsibility for pay arrangements wherever
possible should be delegated to those reponsible for the delivery of
services.
For this reason, the Government had submitted evidence to the health
services review body not to recommend an across-the-board increase.
''By providing for a degree of local negotiation, the review body has
endorsed and encouraged the aim of introducing local pay into the NHS.
''I hope therefore that nurses, midwives and health visitors will
participate fully in the local negotiations to secure pay settlements
which are both entirely fair to them and affordable to their
employers.''
Lord James said he fully expected employers to approach negotiations
''in a responsible manner''.
He added: ''The local pay increase must be seen to be fair. Local pay
is not about delivering very low pay awards -- that would be regarded
rightly by staff and the public as unfair.''

<TEXT>
DOCTORS in the US believe they have halted the spread of an incurable
type of blood cancer by treating a woman with a vaccine created by the
immune reaction her brother achieved after being given molecules from
her malignant cells.
The revolutionary technique -- reported yesterday in The Lancet -- has
been found to destroy the malignant cells in the 43-year-old woman, who
first had signs of myeloma in 1989.
Doctors used molecules from the woman's malignant cells to produce an
immune reaction in her 47-year-old brother, and then transferred this
immunity to her via an infusion of his bone marrow.
Within three months of an infusion of the ''primed'' marrow, the
multiplication of malignant cells had stopped.
Tests showed that the woman, who lives in the US, had a new
immune-cell line derived from her brother, and she is now clinically
well with a normal blood count.
Although her long-term outlook is unknown, doctors believe their
results will encourage clinical studies.
Meanwhile, also in The Lancet, it was revealed that doctors hope
immunisation against malaria, the scourge of many developing tropical
countries, may not be too far away.
A potential vaccine has been designed by UK scientists to make the
immune system produce ''killer cells'' that will attack and destroy the
malaria parasite before it can cause any symptoms.
The disease currently kills more than 1,000,000 children each year in
Africa.
Scientists at the Institute of Molecular Medicine in Oxford, and in
the Gambia, hope their work will be a key part of the battle against the
disease caused by mosquito-borne parasites.
They have now found parts of the parasite -- known as peptides --
against which most people can develop killer cells. The peptides have
been made into a potential vaccine that will target the parasite at an
early stage of infection.
Dr Adrian Hill, a Wellcome Trust Senior Clinical Fellow, who led the
Oxford team, said he was optimistic a vaccine based on peptides would be
useful in the fight against malaria.
''What is very encouraging is that almost all of these components are
the same in all the strains of parasite that have been tested. So,
differences between parasite strains should not be a problem,'' he said.

EDINBURGH has no right to change the law on prostitution ''by the back
door'' through licensing sauna parlours, a court was told yesterday.
Mr Andrew Hajducki, QC, claimed it was clear that licensing policy was
being used to control the city's sex industry.
It did not matter, he told Edinburgh Sheriff Court, if this was
socially desirable or for safety and public health reasons. It was
illegal, and changing the law was a task for Parliament.
''It is not a case whether Edinburgh District Council has an
enlightened view on the subject or not. That is irrelevant.
''It is not up to a district council to decide it is going to change
the law on its own,'' Mr Hajducki said.
He represents Mrs Debra Scanlon, an unemployed book-keeper, of Iona
Street, Leith, in an appeal against the granting of an entertainment
licence to the Gemini Sauna, owned by Mr Ian Haig, near her home.
Mr Hajducki told Sheriff Nigel Thomson that it was disingenuous for
the council to deny the policy since its existence had been publicly
acknowledged by both councillors and senior police.
However, Mr Gordon Steele, advocate for the council, said the policy
on entertainment licences covered activities ranging from go-karting to
concerts at the Usher Hall.
Mr Steele said that planning permission for change of use of the
premises to a health studio had not attracted a single objection. The
sauna could have opened straight away but for the council's insistence
on an entertainment licence.
He said the council could have been challenged by the applicant, Mr
Haig, if it rejected his application on the basis of mere assertions. He
claimed the appeal raised entirely new material.
''It is now too late to come up with new objections which were not
raised at the appropriate time,'' he added.
The hearing on whether the appeal can proceed continues.

AN Asian-born social worker was unfairly dismissed and discriminated
against on racial grounds by Strathclyde region, an industrial tribunal
found yesterday.
It has taken six years for Mr Abdul Rashid Zafar, 59, of Baliol
Street, Glasgow, to win the judgment.
0 However, the tribunal rejected five other complaints lodged by Mr
Zafar that he had been passed over on several occasions for promotion on
racial grounds. It also rejected his claim that he had been the victim
of a sustained vendetta carried out by members of the region's social
work department.
The judgment declined to draw the inference of victimisation and
stated that his dismissal was unfair because of procedural errors.
He was dismissed in 1989 following alleged incidents of sexual
harassment involving three social work clients and two former
colleagues. No action was taken to investigate these incidents at the
time.
A further hearing will now be held to decide whether or not to order
the region to reinstate Mr Zafar to his position as a senior social
worker and to ascertain what compensation should be paid.
Mr Zafar, 59, said: ''I'm absolutely delighted the tribunal found in
my favour. These people have ruined my career. No-one should have to go
through the six years of agony I have suffered. I was forced to live on
social security which I hated.''
The social worker, who has three adult children, claims he also lost
three jobs with English social work departments because of hostile
references provided by the region.
Mr Zafar, who arrived in Britain from Pakistan in 1965, had joined
Glasgow Corporation in 1969.
Mr Zafar, who was backed by the Commission for Racial Equality, now
hopes the region will be ordered to reinstate him. He also wants the
tribunal to order compensation of more than #100,000 to cover his lost
salary, pension rights and injury to his feelings during his six years
of unemployment.
The CRE's head of litigation, Mr Khurshid Drabu, said: ''It has taken
many years for Mr Zafar to prove that he received unfair treatment at
the hands of the largest local authority in the country. The commission
is pleased with the result and urges Strathclyde Regional Council to
revise its practices and procedures so as to ensure that the evil of any
racial discrimination is eliminated from them.''
Legal costs incurred by the commission, who first became involved with
Mr Zafar's fight two years ago, came to between #5OOO and #6000, with
the region's legal bill thought to be around #30,000.
A spokesman for Strathclyde Regional Council said: ''It would be
inappropriate to comment at this stage since the case has been continued
for a hearing of remedy. But it should be noted that although the
tribunal decided to uphold Mr Zafar's claim of unfair dismissal, it
refused the remaining five cases.''
The tribunal's written judgment, which was 83 pages long, referred to
the delay involved in the case. It said this was ''gross''. ''The
failure to inform the applicant of what was going on fell far below the
standards of the reasonable employer.''
The tribunal's findings also noted that some incidents cited by the
region as evidence for Mr Zafar's dismissal had been ''resurrected after
the passage of time'' and smacked ''more of revenge than justice''.
A special inquiry team was set up to investigate Mr Zafar's conduct
after concerns were voiced by colleagues and other agencies as to his
attitude while on intake duty, which apparently resulted in clients
refusing to be interviewed by him.
The inquiry team's report was sent to Mr Zafar's superior, Mr George
Irving, who then suspended the social worker. Mr Zafar was asked to
attend a disciplinary hearing, which was postponed after he reported
sick. Mr Irving eventually decided to proceed in his absence and dismiss
him.
The tribunal was critical of the council's failure to take any action
at the time when complaints were made of Mr Zafar's conduct, and he was
not advised of the details of the case against him until almost a year
after the first alleged incident. But there was no conspiracy against
him, the tribunal found.
The hearing for remedy is expected to take place some time in June.

Marine biologist Ben Wilson, of Aberdeen University's dolphin research

that the bottle-nosed dolphins were responsible for the deaths of
porpoises washed up on the coast.
He said: ''The next stage is to find out why they are doing it.''

<TEXT>
POLITICIANS who break the rules could for the first time face close
outside scrutiny under proposals being drawn up by the committee
investigating standards in public life.
Sources close to Lord Nolan's committee also confirm it is considering
tough new controls on former Ministers taking up jobs in the private
sector.
Finishing touches were put to Lord Nolan's report at a private meeting
yesterdy.
Lord Nolan's inquiry was set up under a personal initiative of the
Prime Minister, who is keen to tackle the image of ''sleaze''
bedevilling his Government and public life in general.
The main proposals are believed to be that an independent scrutineer,
and not just the Privileges Committee, should consider cases where MPs
allegedly break the rules.
Secondly, a separate committee which already monitors the business
appointments of senior civil servants should extend its remit to cover
former Ministers wishing to take up jobs in the private sector.
Backbench MPs would be advised not to act as paid lobbyists, but would
be free to represent particular interests.
The Prime Minister will see the proposals next month, but Labour
protested yesterday that they do not go far enough and the Liberal
Democrats insisted that, whatever the report contained, it was vital to
rebuild trust between the Government and the governed.
LABOUR threatened last night to withdraw from a committee
investigating former Tory Minister Neil Hamilton's alleged
non-disclosure of a stay at the Ritz Hotel in Paris.
Opposition spokesman Jeff Rooker warned of possible non-co-operation
if the Members' Interests Select Committee came up with a ''whitewash''.
His threat came just before MPs backed a Government move to allow
Commons select committees to ban MPs who are not members from private
meetings if they are obstructive.
This followed disruption of the Members' Interests committee private
hearings by Labour MP Mr Dale Campbell-Savours (Workington).
Mr Rooker backed the motion, saying: ''I see no case for disruption of
procedures in a committee of this House.''However, he condemned the
committee as a ''classic example of the failure of self-regulation''.
Mr Rooker added: ''It's a bent and twisted Government that seeks to
manipulate investigative committees of this House.''
Mr Campbell-Savours said a committee should not be given the power to
direct an MP to withdraw and that the floor of the House ''must
crucially remain the forum for appeal for a Member who feels a committee
is conducting its affairs contrary to the interests of Parliament''.

THE first meeting of the new Renfrewshire council ended in uproar last
night as the SNP tried to force the Labour group to debate a motion
about alleged improprieties in the Ferguslie Community Business and its
associate companies.
The meeting was held to make appointments for the new council. But the
SNP group leader, Councillor Bruce McFee, tried to introduce an
emergency motion near the end of the proceedings.
He started to read the motion, saying: ''This council is appalled by
the continuing scandalous behaviour of the Labour Party in Renfrewshire,
which has already brought this new council into disrepute. This council
supports initiatives for a full and public investigation into the
allegations surrounding Ferguslie Community Business and associate
companies.''
But he was interrupted by the council convener, Councillor Nancy
Allison, who refused to allow the motion. She said the item was not on
the agenda and would not be accepted.
SNP councillors then began to heckle from the back of the council
chambers. Councillor McFee shouted that the new council should be set up
with a clean bill of health and there should be no question of improper
practices.
As a number of SNP councillors continued to demonstrate loudly, the
new deputy leader, Councillor Jim Mitchell, walked from the back of the
hall and approached Councillor Allison in the convener's chair. He
demanded that nothing should be brushed under the carpet and the motion
should be allowed.
But Councillor Allison called the meeting to order and added: ''I will
not be threatened, go and sit down. I apologise for this appalling
behaviour by the SNP to all the new councillors.''
At that point Councillor McFee led the 11 SNP councillors from the
hall. He was still claiming there should be a full investigation into
the company.
After the meeting he told The Herald: ''It was a simple request to
support a full investigation, but they did not take the opportunity to
bring it out in the open.''
He said the SNP had challenged the Labour Party to investigate FCB
Enterprise Security Ltd around 18 months ago. He claimed there had been
a series of breaches of council rules and guidelines.
Councillor McFee said he now challenged the Scottish Labour Party
general secretary, Mr Jack McConnell, and Paisley North Labour MP Mrs
Irene Adams to state publicly when they were aware of allegations about
FCB.
He claimed an inquiry had been postponed until after the local
elections earlier this month.
He added: ''We'll carry on shouting and screaming if they don't enter
into a debate. We put forward a properly-constituted motion on the
agenda and they refused to debate it. We had no option but to make our
point forcibly in the chamber.''
After the meeting, Renfrewshire Labour leader Councillor Hugh Henry
said: ''What we had tonight from the SNP was a disgraceful attempt to
introduce petty party politics into the first meeting of this authority.
We have no responsibility for services yet and are not in a position to
take decisions about what the SNP were trying to raise.
''Any allegations of malpractice should be directed to Strathclyde
Regional Council and Renfrew District Council, who are responsible
authorities in that area. If there are any allegations of illegal
activities then evidence should be provided to the police.''

A BUST sculpted from 2500 wire coathangers by Scots artist, Mr David
Mach, is among the exhibits at an exhibition opening today at the Royal
Scottish Academy in Edinburgh, writes GRAEME MURRAY.
The 7ft high work, valued at #47,000 and titled Likeness Guaranteed,
was completed in April last year. It is a portrait of television
presenter Richard Jobson, at one time the lead singer with rock group
The Skids.
Mr Mach, whose recent works include the tyre temple and Sumo wrestlers
at Leith Docks, modelled the sculpture in clay before shaping the
coathangers to fit the bust.
President of the Royal Scottish Academy, Mr William Baillie, pictured
beside the bust, described the work as a ''very entertaining''
sculpture.
The exhibition, also featuring works by George Wyllie, is sponsored by
Maclay, Murray and Spens, solicitors and runs until July 24.

A MULTINATIONAL fish-processing company must pay the #11,000 maximum
compensation to a former manager it sacked while on maternity leave.
The Western Isles Seafood Company, which yesterday opened a #1.5m
factory near Stornoway, has lost an appeal against the decision of an
industrial tribunal.
The tribunal had unanimously found that Miss Fiona Cowan, of
Newvalley, Lewis, was unfairly dismissed. She was a marketing and
administration manager at its Maaruig, Harris, factory.
Miss Cowan's job was being transferred to Bruges, in Belgium, but the
tribunal found there had been no warning and no consultation.
Belgian-owned WISCO appealed on two grounds. It claimed that the
tribunal should have considered the likelihood of whether Miss Cowan
would have returned to work if the redundancy procedure had been
correct.
The firm also argued that, as the only alternative job was a part-time
bookkeeper's post at #5000 per annum, compensation should have been
based on that figure.
However, Lord Coulsfield, presiding over an employment appeals
tribunal, said: ''In our view that argument is unfounded.
''The industrial tribunal plainly did not limit themselves to that
particular alternative employment in reaching the view that consultation
would not have been useless, and that alternative employment was a real
possibility.''
The judge said: ''The tribunal was entitled to assess compensation in
the way it did.''
Miss Cowan, who is separated from her husband and still unemployed,
was ''absolutely delighted'' yesterday.
She said: ''Too often these companies take advantage of the poor jobs
situation, particularly here in the islands, and pay too little regard
to people's rights.''
There was no-one available at WISCO to comment yesterday.

A KIRK minister has enraged one of his town's most respected families
by refusing to baptise their newest addition.
The Rev Ian Hamilton of Nairn Old Parish Church has made the stand
because three-month-old baby Fionn's parents, Ross and Merlin Corbett,
live away from the town and cannot attend his church.
Now Mr Corbett's uncle, Mr Alex Mackay has resigned his senior elder's
post at the church in protest over the minister's refusal.
Mr Mackay said: ''The family were devastated by Mr Hamilton's refusal.
Ross was deeply involved in church activities as a young man in Nairn,
but now his work means he has to live in England. It was his wish that
his daughter should be baptised in the church he attended as a
youngster.''
He added: ''Membership of the church is falling and this kind of
attitude does nothing to bring people back into the fold.''
Mr Corbett's mother, Mairi, said she found the decision very
disappointing. ''I always thought I could call it my family church. We
were all baptised in it and we had weddings there, and I was a Sunday
School teacher for years.''
Mr Hamilton said he has the full support of the Kirk Session and
claims it was Mr and Mrs Corbett who prevented the baptism, by refusing
to become members of the church.
He said: ''I am perfectly satisfied that I did all I could in relation
to this matter. For me to have proceeded would have contravened the law
of our national church which states that baptism may only proceed where
the parents are church members, bona fide adherents, or desire to seek
admission to full membership of the church. In this particular case none
of the above criteria were relevant.''
When asked about Mr Mackay's protest he said: ''For an ordained elder
to ask his minister to break his Vows of Ordination ''to oblige' in this
kind of situation is beyond credibility.''
Baby Fionn was eventually christened by neighbouring minister, the Rev
Tom Heggie at the town's Congregational Church.

THE procedures for choosing chief executives for the new single-tier
councils could be open to legal challenge, councillors were warned
yesterday.
A paper by local government experts at Strathclyde University
criticises the advice given by the Local Government Staff Commission
over the filling of the top posts.
The commission, whose members were selected by Scottish Secretary Ian
Lang, advised existing councils that the chief executives' jobs for the
29 new authorities need only be advertised internally.
The new authorities could decide to throw the jobs open to wider
competition if they wished at a later stage.
Richard Kerley and Sarah Gadsden of the Scottish Local Authorities
Management Centre at the university, however, claim that the decision
not to advertise publicly the appointments has breached common practice
in many councils and might be argued to be discriminatory.
The approach of restricting applications to existing local government
staff and those of associated bodies was ''weak in both principle and
practice,'' said the academics.
They also claim that this internal advertising could be seen as
discriminatory towards women and members of ethnic minority groups who
are particularly under-represented among Scottish council chiefs.
The paper warns that, in the circumstances, any aggrieved person will
be in a strong position to take legal action against a council where
procedures might be considered unfair or discriminatory.
It says: ''Even where there is no evidence of direct discrimination,
very poor appointment procedures may give grounds for complaint and
legal challenge.''
However, the chairman of the staff commission, Mr Robert Peggie,
strongly defended the commission's actions.
Addressing the annual conference of the Scottish branch of the
Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, at Gleneagles
Hotel, Mr Peggie said he made no apology for the decision to restrict
applications for the chief executives' jobs to those in local government
and new town staff which had been unanimously agreed by the commission.
To have thrown them open to outside applicants, he claimed, would not
have been consistent with the commission's remit to safeguard the
interests of those who were currently employed in Scottish local
government.
Mr Peggie said the reorganisation was not about shedding jobs but was
about retaining the existing skills within local government.

TROUBLED flared at Rolls-Royce in East Kilbride yesterday on the first
full day of strike action at the plant.
Two pickets were treated for minor injuries after apparently being hit
by a car trying to enter the plant.
Later union leaders claimed the senior manager driving the car had
''speeded up'' on the approach to the gates.
But last night police said no charges are to be made in connection
with the incident.
More than 500 workers walked out of the aero-engine design unit on
Wednesday over management plans to axe 600 jobs and transfer production
to two plants in England.
Union leaders were said to be angry over the incident. One of the
pickets is said to have required hospital treatment for an ankle injury.
The manager involved, who has not been identified, is understood to
have been questioned by police who were called to investigate the
incident.
Inspector Alan Robinson said: ''A road accident occurred in that a car
had run over someone's foot.
''We were called in by the ambulance services and interviewed all who
were at the scene.
''A road accident report has been filed, but we do not anticipate that
anyone will be charged in connection with this.''
A Rolls-Royce spokesman said: ''We are aware that an incident took
place. But the fact that the police are not blaming anyone speaks for
itself.
''The incident was unfortunate, but we are pleased the police have
concluded their investigation without deeming it necessary to charge
anyone.''

FOUR police officers, one a woman, suffered eye injuries, and 13
protesters were arrested yesterday, following violent protests yesterday
against live animal exports at Brightlingsea.
Police and vehicles came under a hail of missiles, including bottles,
beer cans, coins, stones -- and eggs apparently injected with paint or a
purple chemical. Two officers were treated in hospital then allowed
home.
Two coachloads of demonstrators from Shoreham, Kent, swelled the crowd
to more than 500 as seven lorries -- four carrying calves and three
sheep -- escorted by 200 police, took 40 minutes to push through the
throng to the Essex port.
Meanwhile, in Kent, where live animal shipments resumed at Dover
police have targeted known animal rights activists to warn them they
could be arrested if they protest against the cargoes.
Letters were sent to former members of Dover Against Live Exports and
Compassion in World Farming several days ago, warning they faced charges
under the 1986 Public Order Act. Similar letters were sent to people in
Brightlingsea.
Yesterday, Mr Mark Bahler, 28, from Hildenborough, Kent, was arrested
under the provisions of the Act. He was alleged to have driven his car
on to a roundabout near the Dover dock entrance, chained himself to the
steering wheel, and blocked traffic for several minutes.
Police said later that a hypodermic syringe had been used to inject
the eggs. Several police cars and the animal lorries were spattered with
various colours.
Protester Ms Sue Wheeler said: ''I saw a can of paint, or thinners,
come from the crowd and hit a policeman in the eye. I and a couple of
others went in and pulled him out. He was treated by their own medics.
He looked pretty bad.''
However, six trailers containing 1200 sheep and 600 calves bound for
Dunkirk, had swept into the docks 30 minutes before Mr Bahler acted. The
shipments were the first there since the High Court ruled last week that
ports like Dover and Plymouth must take animal cargoes because they are
a legal trade.
Exporter Mr Peter Gilder, who launched the High Court action, said:
''People have a right to protest, but they do not have a right to smash
the windows of our lorries and stop us going about our lawful
business.''
More lorries are expected in Dover today. Mr Gilder has the use of a
berth for the next 10 days, after which it goes up for auction to other
exporters.
Dr Gavin Strang, Shadow Agriculture Minister, called for a licensing
scheme for all livestock transporters, with draconian measures for those
who breach standards.
''Animals should be leaving these islands on the hook rather than on
the hoof. Animals should be slaughtered as close as possible to the
point of production,'' he added.

A BUILDER who has spent almost five years pursuing damages against a
solicitors' firm yesterday abandoned his claim at Paisley Sheriff Court.
However, Mr Iain McIntyre, who says his business, health, and personal
life have been wrecked by the incompetence of solicitors and the
ruthless attitude of insurance companies, pledged to raise a fresh
action in the Court of Session.
Mr McIntyre's problems began in 1985 when he consulted Wright and
Crawford over a housing project he was developing in Paisley. Phase one
was successful and to develop phase two it was essential to build an
access road through a plot on the first development.
However, a partner in Wright and Crawford made a conveyancing error
when he failed to reserve a right to construct the access road and phase
two never went ahead. The solicitors' firm admitted negligence after two
years, but the firm and its professional indemnity insurers Sun Alliance
continue to dispute the extent of Mr McIntyre's loss.
Subsequently, he claimed that the advice he received from a Glasgow
firm was also negligent. He then employed a third firm, which now no
longer works for him.
He is highly critical of the Law Society of Scotland, to whom he
turned for help, and the solicitors' insurance scheme.
Yesterday, Mr McIntyre applied to Sheriff Alexander McIlwain in
Paisley Sheriff Court to grant a ''sisting'' or continuation of his
motion for abandonment as he was still unrepresented.
When Sheriff McIlwain refused that motion, he put forward a motion of
''forum non conveniens,'' in essence that Paisley Sheriff Court was not
a legitimate court for his action to be heard.
Sheriff McIlwain said he had no option but to dismiss the action.
Mr McIntyre said he planned to lodge an appeal against the decision
not to allow a continuation or allow him to make submissions in support
of his motion of ''forum non conveniens''.
The abandonment of his case against Wright and Crawford, the firm's
partners, and their insurers, Sun Alliance International, meant Mr
McIntyre had to pay Wright and Crawford's #21,966.58 expenses.
He now plans to raise fresh proceedings claiming damages for
professional negligence in the Court of Session against Wright and
Crawford and the second firm he engaged.

Washington
AS the hunt for the Oklahoma bombers spread, a man was detained at
Heathrow airport and sent back to the US: his luggage, found at Rome
airport, contained possible bomb-making equipment.
The man, a Jordanian with a US passport, is reported to have been in
Oklahoma City the day before the bombing of the federal building, in
which 200 were still missing last night. He tried to fly from Chicago to
Rome on his way to Amman on Wednesday night but was delayed by airport
police and missed his flight.
He was allowed to leave later, on a flight to London. His luggage went
on to Rome where it was opened by police who said that it contained
equipment that could be used to make explosives.
The contents included several kitchen knives, two reels of electrical
wire, silicone, a hammer, tweezers, a video recorder and photographs of
military missiles and tanks, airport sources said.
They said the three suitcases had been carried on an American Airlines
flight from Oklahoma City to Chicago and then to Rome on an Alitalia
flight which arrived at 7.40am. The luggage had been due to travel on to
Amman, the sources said.
Washington described the man as a ''witness''. Early reports from
London said he was a suspect. One source at Heathrow said he was put on
board the flight to the US in handcuffs. Escorted by federal agents, he
arrived back in Washington last night.
His detention appeared connected with a pledge by Mr Major. He told
MPs he had spoken to President Clinton and offered assistance. ''I have
told him that we are ready to help in any way we can and as events will
show, we are assisting.'' Later the man was held.
President Clinton warned that there would be ''nowhere to hide'' for
the bombers. His determination was reinforced by Attorney-General Janet
Reno, who said a $2m reward was being offered.
At almost the same time, the FBI issued warrants for the arrest of two
men who rented a truck which they believe was linked with the attack.
Special agent Weldon Kennedy said: ''Both of these men should be
considered armed and extremely dangerous. Citizens should not attempt to
take any action against them.''
Both men are white. One is described as having a tattoo on his left
arm.
Mr Kennedy said investigators had identified the vehicle used in
connection with the attack and that the men were ''associated with this
vehicle''.
CNN said it was a rented Ryder truck. A rented Ryder truck was also
used in the 1993 bombing of the New York World Trade Centre. Ryder is a
major truck rental company in the US.
The New York bombing was solved when fragments of a van were
discovered, which led to the place where it had been rented, and the
arrest of the man who rented it.
Police in New York had the good fortune to recover a fragment of the
van's chassis, with a registration number. Their colleagues in Oklahoma
City hope to find a similar clue, and there was a report that an axle
from the vehicle used by the bombers was found 200 yards from the bomb
crater.
Meanwhile, there were conflicting reports on others reportedly held by
police. Mr Kennedy denied that the authorities had already arrested some
people.
However, there were reports that three men had been picked up, in
Texas and Oklahoma, and were being held on immigration charges.
The death toll officially reached 52 yesterday, but rescue workers
reported they had seen many bodies in the ruins and about 200 of the
people who may have been inside have not been accounted for. There were
432 treated for injuries, of whom about 50 were still in hospital, some
of them seriously injured.
Rescue work continued through the night, but was suspended at mid-day
yesterday while the ruins were shored up. Engineers feared that the
remains of the building were about to collapse.
One woman, 20-year-old Dana Bradley, was rescued after her leg was
amputated by surgeon Andy Sullivan working on his stomach in a foot of
water. Her four-month-old son, three-year-old daughter and her mother
were missing.
The America's Kids day-care centre was on the first floor, just above
the spot where the car containing the bomb was parked. The police say
the centre was licensed for 32 children, but could not say how many were
inside.
It was completely crushed under the seven collapsed floors above.
Those parts of the centre that were accessible to rescue workers were
described as scenes of carnage: many more dead children will be found
there in the next few days.
There was still hope that there might be survivors buried under the
slabs of concrete and the heavy beams, or trapped in the parking garage
below ground. Dogs, listening devices and television cameras threaded
into the wreckage were all being used in the hunt.
The workers tell each other that survivors were dug out of the ruins
of the Kobe and Mexico City earthquakes days after the event.
Mr Clinton declared that the bombing was an attack on the United
States and warned those responsible that ''there is no place to hide''
in America or abroad.
He left the door open to possible US military retaliation if it were
discovered another government was behind the attack, but stressed he was
making no accusations.
At the same time, he urged Americans not to ''jump to conclusions''
about the identity of the bombers or let stereotyped notions of
terrorists affect their thinking.
''This is not a question of anyone's country of origin. This is not a
question of anybody's religion. This was was murder, this was evil, this
was wrong,'' Mr Clinton said.

THREE teenagers who broke out of a young offenders' institution were
caught after a 100mph car chase, Perth Sheriff Court was told yesterday.
Kenneth MacLeod, 18, Steven Gibson, 17, and Alan Neil, 19, escaped
from Castle Huntly, by Dundee, on March 21.
They admitted attempting to pervert the course of justice by escaping.
MacLeod also admitted resetting a stolen Vauxhall Astra, near the
institution and driving it dangerously and while disqualified for over
20 miles in Perthshire and Fife.
Gibson also admitted endangering the lives of pursuing policemen by
throwing objects through the sunroof into their path.
Depute-fiscal Sandy Mitchell said after MacLeod had raced through four
villages a patrol car overtook him. It was then rammed by the stolen car
and MacLeod crashed to a halt.
An agent said that the trio had escaped while window bars were removed
during renovations at Castle Huntly.
Sheriff John McInnes sentenced MacLeod to four-months' detention and
Gibson to three-months', to be served at the end of their current terms.
MacLeod was also banned for three years. Sentence was deferred on Neil
for reports.

A DETECTIVE yesterday told the High Court in Glasgow how a criminal
put out a contract on his life.
Detective Inspector Derek Ingram, 41, named Mr Paul Ferris as the man
who wanted him and other officers dead.
Asked by solicitor advocate Mr Michael McSherry what a contract was,
the detective replied: ''A price is paid to take someone's life away.''
Mr Ingram told the court that nobody took up the contract, and it was
subsequently decided by criminals to try to entrap him. They planned to
catch him on camera handing over heroin to another man.
He added: ''I met the person who it was alleged I was going to plant
drugs on, but I did not fall victim to the operation.''
Asked about the purpose of the 1986 plot against him, he said it was
revenge for him arresting, along with other officers, an individual.
Mr Ingram was giving evidence at the trial of Mr Thomas Bagan, 39, of
Station Road, Blantyre, Mr Gordon McLeod, 39, of Jacks Road, Uddingston,
and Mr James Scougall, 34, of Angus Walk, Viewpark.
They deny hijacking a security van at gunpoint outside the Bank of
Scotland in Hamilton, and robbing three guards of #283,000.
Mr Bagan has lodged a special defence of incrimination, naming Mr Paul
Ferris, Mr Thomas McGraw, and Mr Donald McMillan.
Mr Bagan told the court that he was a bodyguard for former 'Glasgow
Godfather' Mr Arthur Thompson, who became involved in a power struggle
with Mr McGraw, whom he named as the new 'Godfather' in the city.
He said that after he went to work for McGraw, the late Mr Thomson
twice confronted him with a gun.
Yesterday, Mr Bagan told the court that his lawyers had tried to trace
Mr Ferris and McGraw to bring them to court to give evidence, but had
failed to find them.
He said that the night before the robbery, Mr Ferris wanted to borrow
a white van that he and the two co-accused used in their double glazing
business.
Later, he was told Mr Ferris wanted to meet him at a tower block in
Motherwell, to discuss a newspaper article he was involved in.
He and his two co-accused waited for Mr Ferris and Mr McMillan, who
arrived in the white van and then drove off in a car.
Mr Bagan said as he, Mr McLeod, and Mr Scougall drove off in the van
they noticed a shotgun in the back and a number of sacks, and then
discovered they were being followed by police, who then arrested them.
He said the reason he was ''framed'' for the robbery was that,
following the newspaper story, Mr McGraw and Mr Ferris wanted him in
jail.
Daily Record crime reporter, Mr Stephen Wilkie, 29, told the court
that last year he did several stories about the power struggle for
control of crime in Glasgow.
He then learned that Mr Bagan's name was on a ''hit list'', and he was
to be killed. He said he was contacted by Mr Bagan and when they met
told him of the list.
Asked by Mr McSherry if the accused seemed afraid, he replied: ''No,
but he was very wary.''
Questioned by Mr James Scott, for the prosecution, Mr Wilkie said he
had learned from underworld contacts and senior police officers that
there was more than one hit list which included Mr Bagan's name.
Mr Donald McMillan, 42, of Kintra Street, Govan, Glasgow, the third
man blamed for the robbery by Mr Bagan was told by Temporary Judge
Alexander Wilkinson, QC, that he need not answer any question which
would suggest he was guilty of a criminal offence.
Asked by Mr McSherry if he had taken part in the armed robbery, he
replied: ''I don't want to answer that question.''
The trial continues.

A MAN who successfully pleaded not guilty to murder in the ''wheelie
bin trial'' found himself being accused again yesterday -- by one of the
people in the dock.
Mr Raymond Henfry, 28, was named by Mr Kenneth McGuire, 35, at the
High Court in Glasgow when he lodged a special defence of incrimination
blaming Henfry and two others.
Mr McGuire and Mr Michael Fay, 28, deny murdering Mr Kenneth Syme, 48,
on January 1 by throwing him repeatedly from the fourth floor window of
a flat in Watchmeal Crescent, Faifley, Clydebank.
Mr McGuire also denies binding Mr Syme's head and ankles with plastic
bags and concealing his body in a wheelie bin in a bid to destroy
evidence and avoid arrest.
And he has pleaded not guilty to a charge of threatening to throw
another man, Mr Ian Reid, out of a window in the same flat, and
assaulting a third man, Mr John Slevin, to his severe injury and
permanent disfigurement.
Mr McGuire blames Mr Reid, his co-accused Mr Fay, and Mr Henfry for
the alleged murder.
The trial before Lord Osborne was adjourned until today after the jury
heard just one witness.
Twenty four hours earlier, Mr Henfry, of Kinclaven Avenue, Drumchapel,
was freed when the prosecution accepted his plea of not guilty to the
murder.
Mr Henfry, however, admitted moving the wheelie bin containing Mr
Syme's body to lock-up garages in nearby Faifley Road with intent to
defeat the ends of justice.
He is now to be a prosecution witness.

A LABOUR candidate elected to Highland Council by 254 votes only to be
told 40 minutes later that his opponent had beaten him by 165 votes, has
refused to accepts an official explanation of the mix-up.
Mr James MacKay, who stood in the Lochaber ward of Caol, insists that
the only fair way to proceed is to invite the Electoral Reform Society
to adjudicate on the result.
Mr MacKay made his comments last night after receiving the official
explanation from the returning officer, Highland region's chief
executive Mr Ron Stevenson, as to why Mrs Olwyn Macdonald had been
finally declared the victor in the election.
Mr MacKay said: ''I do not accept his explanation. At one point he
says that both candidates were contacted as soon as it was apparent
there was something wrong. Well, I wasn't contacted. Neither was Olwyn.
''He says that there was a recount. There wasn't a recount. Only the
candidates can demand a recount and a recount means you start counting
all over again. That never happened.
''Why on earth didn't he ask us both to go up to Inverness and go
through the ballot papers again with whatever representation we wanted?
I wrote suggesting that.''
He added: ''If he had done that I would have accepted the outcome
without question. As it is I do not accept the result.''
Mr MacKay, sitting Labour district councillor for Caol, was selected
to fight the ward ahead of Mrs Macdonald, the Labour regional councillor
for the area. She promptly resigned from the party and stood as an
independent.
Originally, a 682-428 result was declared in Mr MacKay's favour. Then
a recount was held and Mrs Macdonald was said to have gained 657 votes
to Mr MacKay's 492.
The inquiry into the mistake discovered two ''major errors''.
A cardboard ballot box of postal votes was not included in the first
count after being moved under a table and missed by election staff, then
figures for counted ballot papers were written in the wrong columns.
Mr Stevenson said last night: ''As returning officer for the overall
Highland Council election, I clearly have to accept that there were
major failings on the part of the system and of individuals in relation
to the ward.''
He also unreservedly apologised to the two candidates.

FOOTBALLER Ian Redford could be prosecuted after demolishing part of a
decaying listed building he claims was putting his children in danger.
The former Rangers player, now with Raith Rovers, tackled the
crumbling ruin in the back garden of his home.
But he had not been granted planning permission to touch it.
Mr Redford knocked down part of the building, which was damaged by
floods and gales earlier this year, after being told by council
officials to make it safe.
But after being given seven days to act, he was then told he had not
been given the planning permission -- an act which could lead to him
being charged with a criminal offence.
Yesterday, Mr Redford, who has children aged five and two, said that
when he and his family moved into the house near Newburgh, Fife, last
September, the ruin, called the Old House of Carpow, was in a state of
decay and had been for decades.
He said: ''It acted like a magnet for my kids and also with three dogs
running around it was unsafe.
''I phoned the council who said I had to make it safe within seven
days, but then a few weeks ago they told me I had not had planning
permission and had to apply for retrospective permission.
''This has been done but takes 12 weeks so we will have to wait to see
the outcome.''
A spokesman for North East Fife Council said: ''Technically when
someone does some work on a listed building without planning permission
they are open to prosecution.
''But when public safety is involved, that takes preference and is
seen as a hugely mitigating factor, especially if they were told to make
it safe.

THE girlfriend of a man shot dead while leaving a Glasgow public house
yesterday pleaded for witnesses to come forward.
Mr James McHugh, 45, of Broadholm Street, Parkhouse, Glasgow was shot
three times in the foyer of the Ashfield Bar, Hawthorn Street at around
10.45pm on Sunday, April 9.
Miss Karen Kennedy, 35, said there was no reason for the attack:
''It's a coward that did it. He was a very kind and caring man. No-one
disliked him. He was nice to everybody and great to my two kids.''
The killer, using a handgun, opened fire from the car park about 20ft
away. The weapon has not yet been recovered. About an hour earlier Mr
McHugh had been involved in a fight in the Morven bar in Edgefauld Road.
Apart from the earlier fight, police can offer no possible motives for
the killing.
Miss Kennedy strongly denied any suggestion that he might have been
involved in drugs.
Mr McHugh worked occasionally as a taxi-driver. He had divorced from
his long-estranged wife four months ago and had a 15 year-old daughter.
There has been little public response to police appeals for witnesses.
Detective Chief Inspector Eric Pile, who is leading the investigation,
described the killing as ''senseless and mindless'' and appealed to
people in the local communities to contact the police with any
information.
''People may be frightened to come forward but I can assure them that
we have ample resources and protection methods in hand,'' he said.
A blonde woman about 20-years-old was seen getting into a black
taxi-cab about five minutes earlier. Police would also like to hear from
three or four youths who had been standing outside the bar at the same
time.
A blue Astra-type car and a possible silver-grey Jaguar had been in
the vicinity.

A THIRD bidder has appeared on the scene in the contest for ownership
of Ferguson, the Port Glasgow shipbuilder, it was revealed yesterday.
It was expected that the fate of the Clyde yard would be decided next
week when the board meets to discuss two rival proposals.
Millionaire Frank Dunnett, is believed to have tabled a cash bid of
just over #4 a share for each of the company's 1.2 million shares, while
Altnacraig has indicated it is prepared to table an offer of #3 cash
plus several Altnacraig shares.
Mr Richard Deane, finance director of Ferguson, said yesterday that he
could not confirm the price attached to each offer but confirmed the
directors intended to make their decision when they meet next Wednesday.
The chief executive of the yard, Mr Bill Scott, is at present on a
four-week holiday but will be in contact with the board and will cast
his vote by telephone
However, if the third inquiry, which is believed to be from a Scottish
company, is confirmed then a final decision could be delayed.
The issue is complicated by the fact that Ferguson was originally
purchased under Business Enterprise rules which has tax advantages for
shareholders who retain their investment for the full BES period --
which in the case of Ferguson expires in March 1996.
There is also discussion as to what precise value can be placed on the
Altnacraig shares -- they have a face value of #1 but the company has
incurred losses since it was launched.
Sir Ross Belch, chairman of Ferguson Shipbuilders, also heads
Altnacraig and because of this will not be able to take part in the
boardroom decision.
Altnacraig has said it will only make a firm offer for the shipyard,
which has a full order book, if the directors indicate they favour its
proposal. This is because Altnacraig does not wish to become involved in
an auction-type situation.

A BID to break the legal impasse over the two Libyans accused of the
Lockerbie bombing was yesterday rejected by the Government.
The Tory MP and former Scottish Office Minister Allan Stewart put
forward a proposal that under the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill a
trial could be held outwith Scotland.
He said his proposal was supported by the relatives of those who had
died, that the Government of Libya had accepted it, and that, in the
House, the Linlithgow Labour MP Tam Dalyell -- who has taken a special
interest in the Lockerbie case -- had said he supported it.
Mr Stewart told the Commons committee considering the Bill: ''This
gives the Government an option, not currently available, to hold a judge
and jury trial outside Scotland.
''I put it to both front benches that currently we have a complete
impasse. There is no way out, there appears to be complete deadlock, so
the new clause provides for the option of a judge and jury trial for the
two suspected Libyan citizens outside Scotland.
''Their perception that their citizens would be faced with an unfair
trial because the jury would be biased against them is no longer a valid
criticism. As time passes, there are more and more doubts being
expressed about the evidence against the two Libyan citizens, but there
are still worries in the Libyan mind.''
He accepted that there were technical difficulties about his proposal,
but he said these were ''not insuperable''.
Mr Dalyell described Mr Stewart's plans as a ''serious proposal for
justice in action,'' but the clause found no favour with either Labour's
front bench spokesman, Mr John McFall, or Government Minister Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton.
Mr McFall said that, while he sympathised with the spirit of what Mr
Stewart was trying to achieve, the new clause was not the answer.
He said: ''It would go no way towards contributing to a solution to
the impasse. It would give rise to many practical problems and at the
end of the day would serve no practical purpose.
''It is only a half-way house and a recipe for prolonging the issue.
If there is a trial, it should take place in Edinburgh. If it is good
enough for the citizens of Scotland, it is good enough for the alleged
Lockerbie bombers.''
Lord James took a similar line. He said that the Lockerbie bombing
remained ''one of the greatest and most atrocious crimes committed this
century''.
He also complemented Mr Stewart on his efforts to find a solution to
the ''current difficult situation''. He added, however, that the
Government took the view that there was no need for the Scottish courts
to sit abroad.
He said: ''I must disagree fundamentally with the unspoken proposition
behind the clause, which I take to be that the protection given by the
Scottish courts, and the Scottish criminal justice system, would not be
sufficient to ensure that the suspects in this case received a fair
trial, unless it were held furth of Scotland.''
Lord James said that a dangerous precedent could be set, which could
be interpreted as an insult to the Scottish judiciary system.
The accused, he said, should not be allowed to choose the form of
trial, and he added: ''The Scottish criminal justice system is at least
as good as any in the world and no-one need fear that the accused would
not receive a fair trial.''
There was a host of procedural and jurisdictional problems attached to
Mr Stewart's proposal, and if any country had to change its legal system
it was the Libyans, who should immediately hand over the two suspects
for trial either in Scotland or the United States, he said.
''The reality is that the amendment would not advance the position in
the Lockerbie case but will lead only to confusion about our position
when it should be and has been clearly understood.
''It is up to the Libyans to make the accused available for trial. The
international community has demaded that. Colonel Gaddafi has in the
past made it clear that they could change their law to enable them to
surrender the accused for trial and I take this opportunity to urge them
yet again to do so.''
At the end of the debate, Mr Stewart withdrew his proposal.

FAMILY doctors are to seek clarification from the Government before
voting on an improved offer to settle a long-standing grievance over
night visits.
The Department of Health yesterday tabled an improved offer,
increasing from #9 to #20 the fee for each home visit between 10pm and
8am, on top of an annual lump sump of #2000.
The whole package would replace the current flat fee of #47.85 per
visit.
In addition, an offer of #15m to develop alternative ways of providing
out-of-hours cover is being increased to #45m -- this would be spent on
support for GP co-operative services and arrangements for doctors in
rural areas who need reimbursement for locum cover.
However, GMC member Dr Brian Keighley, deputy chairman of the Scottish
GPs committee, said doctors were still suspicious about some of the
implications of the offer -- for example, where the #45m would come from
and what would be lost as a result.
He said: ''The #2000 plus #20 package is a straight swop, though they
have found some extra money for it. We have been told the #45m will not
come out of the existing GP budget but will come from the current NHS
budget -- it is not new money.''
Out-of-hours calls to GPs have tripled over the past 20 years from
81,614 to 245,158 in 1993-94, often for what GPs regard as trivial
reasons.
Dr Keighley said: ''This is about a service which is in danger of
collapsing if it continues to be abused the way it has been.''
''We have agreed to send out the ballot on the basis of accept or
reject, together with a briefing paper pointing out the pros and cons.
If it is rejected, we have to go back to the GMC to discuss sanctions.
But we are not proceeding to the ballot until some important matters
have been ironed out.''
Meanwhile, Labour said that switching to local wage bargaining in the
NHS as proposed by the Government could cost #26m, writes Roy Rogers,
Industrial Correspondent.
Thousands of health workers yesterday lobbied MPs over their pay
campaign.
Shadow health secretary, Mrs Margaret Beckett, said each of the 500
NHS trusts might have to employ two staff to administer
locally-negotiated pay rises, which would take money away from patient
care.
Labour also complained about the ''huge sums of money'' being diverted
from front-line services, such as the #155m start-up costs of NHS
trusts.
However, Health Minister, Mr Gerard Malone, said the #26m had been
''plucked out of thin air'' with no evidence to support it.
He said: ''The infrastructure for supporting local pay is already in
place and 40% of Unison members are already on local pay. There are real
benefits from local pay for staff and for the efficient running of the
NHS.''
Mr Bob Abberley, head of health at Unison, said Labour's allegations
added weight to yesterday's lobby of MPs by nurses, ambulance drivers,
ancillary workers, and other NHS staff by urging the Government to step
back from the ''disastrous move to local pay''.
Coaches were laid on to ferry NHS workers from across the country to
the protest, which is the latest stage in the unions' campaign for
''fair pay'' following a proposed 1% central pay offer backed up by
possible local negotiations for up to an additional 2% in return for
efficiency measures.

MANAGERS at one of Scotland's top hospital trusts have been working
out a package of cuts and increased productivity aimed at heading off a
#3m financial crisis.
According to documents passed to The Herald, Glasgow Royal Infirmary
needs to find savings of 3% on its budget -- #115m last year -- and
increase activity by 2% at ''no extra cost''.
Last night the trust claimed the documents were out-of-date and that
some contracts for this year remained to be settled, with the prospect
of a surplus rather than a deficit.
''They are part of regular financial reviews which take place -- they
no longer apply,'' said a spokesman.
However, the documents -- labelled 1995/96 expenditure analysis --
appear to be recent in origin and indicate that hospital chiefs were
budgeting for a sharp downturn in income.
The biggest gap indicated was from their principal purchaser, Greater
Glasgow Health Board, whose own budget has been hit by the Share formula
imposed by the Government to bring big city health budgets
proportionately in line with others that historically had fared worse.
It has meant the screw turning more and more on Glasgow's teaching
hospitals as the city's population declined. The crisis came as no
surprise to Mr Danny Crawford, the secretary of the local health
council.
He said: ''The board have made it clear that the Royal and the Western
Infirmary will suffer financially. The only way a hospital like the
Royal can make an immediate saving is by leaving vacancies unfilled,
which will put more pressure on the rest of the staff. There is
certainly no evidence that the Royal is over-staffed as it is.''
According to the document, the projected income from Greater Glasgow
for 1995/96 is #77.9m, compared with #80.3m last year. Projected income
from every other health board and agency served by the Royal is either
frozen or down. In all, the Royal's projected income is #111.8m,
compared with #115m last year.
Mr Jim Devine, leader of the Unison union, said the Royal would not be
the only major hospital in this situation.
''Clearly the crucial issue in the NHS is underfunding -- here is a
trust in major financial difficulties before it is even in a position to
consider the question of local pay to staff,'' he said.
''There are going to be major reductions in service, in order to
accommodate the reduction in cash. Staff and patients are going to be
asked to pick up the tab. Fewer staff will be asked to care for more
patients.''

A BOMB explosion rocked the legislature building in Charlottetown on
Prince Edward Island yesterday, injuring one man and raising fears of
copycat attacks after the Oklahoma blast.
The legislature was in session at the time of the blast, which hurled
glass and debris for at least three blocks.
''It was a pipe-bomb placed under the wheelchair ramp leading up to
the legislature building,'' said Gail MacDonald, assistant administrator
with the Charlottetown Police Department.
One man who had been sitting nearby when the bomb exploded was treated
for cuts on his legs.
Police said they had no suspects, nor was there any warning before the
blast outside Province House, a historic sandstone landmark on the
island between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, where the Canadian
Confederation was negotiated in 1864.
Witnesses who were inside the legislature of Canada's smallest
province said the noise of the explosion was deafening. It could be
heard throughout the town and shook nearby buildings.

STRATHCLYDE Police have been called in by the National Lottery
organisers Camelot to investigate an alleged lottery ticket fraud in the
South Side of Glasgow.
The fraud is said to have involved cancelling the tickets before
handing them to the customer so as to keep the stake money. It came to
light when security checks by Camelot revealed an unusually high
incidence of void tickets.
A Camelot spokeswoman said: ''There were a lot of cancellations
happening that shouldn't have been. The retailer was suspended
immediately and the police contacted.''
The computer allows 15 minutes cancellation time for customers to
change their numbers.
The incident was described as isolated and Camelot insisted that
no-one would have lost any money.

<TEXT>
COD liver oil and the orange juice used to be considered a healthy
item.
But while there are no worries with the juice, the oil is under attack
from a Swiss scientist.
Professor Michael Oehme, speaking in Shetland at an international
conference on marine pollution, said that cod liver oil was dangerous
unless it had been treated to remove poisons which are slowly polluting
the northern oceans. He also said people should probably avoid eating
too much seal and whale meat.
Professor Oehme said toxic metals and long-lived chemicals like
organo-chlorine pesticides, PCBs and dioxins were building up in the
North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.
Man-made poisons were concentrated in fish which were eaten by seals
and whales. They in turn were eaten by coastal people who were at the
top of the marine food chain. There was increasing evidence that human
health was affected.
Professor Oehme said: ''It's a global time-bomb.''
Speaking on the first day of a meeting on North Atlantic Marine
Mammals, he said prevailing winds carried pesticides and other poisons
into the Arctic from industrialised Europe and North America.
Even pesticides such as toxaphenes, now only used in sub-tropical
countries, were found at high levels north of the Arctic Circle. Lindane
and DDT, long banned in Europe and the USA, were still used in the Third
World and finding their way into the Arctic.
''The atmosphere is the driving force,'' he said. The ''Arctic haze''
seen from airliners flying between Europe and the west coast of North
America was a ''sink'' of toxic compounds which lasted for hundreds of
years.
Professor Oehme said Inuit women living around Hudson's Bay had the
world's highest levels of chlorinated hydrocarbons in their breast milk,
although they had never used pesticides. The poisons had got into seals
and bears which they ate and could affect the Inuit's immune systems --
making them more likely to suffer illness. Reproductive organs were also
affected, particularly in men.
Professor Oehme was ''very pessimistic'' about the future, unless the
world's population was reduced to about a fifth of present levels:
''Most of the pollution problems we can reduce,'' he said, ''but if we
don't voluntarily reduce our numbers then nature will do it for us.''

SHEFFIELD United travel to first-division leaders Middlesbrough today
with manager Dave Bassett conceding they have all but blown their
play-off chances.
The Blades' 2-2 home draw with struggling Swindon yesterday meant they
have collected just six points from their past seven games.
Bassett, who watched in dismay as his side squandered a clutch of
second-half chances, moaned: ''The crowd was booing at half-time and so
was I.''
'Boro' extended their lead to two points -- although second-placed
Tranmere have a game in hand -- courtesy of the late Uwe Fuchs goal that
earned them a point at Notts County.
Manager Bryan Robson, whose side visit Prenton Park on the final day
of the Endsleigh League season, feels the race will not be decided until
May 7.
''It looks like it's going right to the wire, but I feel we're still
in the strongest position.''

I WOULDN'T tell you this were it not for the fact that the whole of
Aberdeenshire knows already, but I have had my first serious breakout of
the year.
The 15 heifers I had been looking forward to offering to an expectant
public managed to get out and were two miles away before anyone noticed.
The day I wasted getting them back really brought it home to me how
things have changed for the farmer with 250 acres and a bad memory.
Had this happened in my father's day his grieve would have taken his
five other men, two of whom had reasonable working dogs, and any
children that were available and brought them back, while my father
worried about the affairs of state as reported in the columns of the
Glasgow Herald.
Along the way the folk who worked on the other farms would know
immediately what was up and move seamlessly to block their road ends and
see the cattle through any nasty crossroads.
Cattle on the road were nothing when I was a boy. We used to walk our
Canadian Holstein steers from the railway station five miles away, with
only minor hiccoughs.
It was quite different last Thursday.
I went out at a quarter-past-seven to find the gate open. Now this has
happened before with that gate. It is held by a bolt and there is a
catch to keep the bolt shot. The plan is that it should stay that way
all winter and so it does if you tie the catch with wire.
There was no handy bit of wire last November when I shut that gate and
I well remember deciding string would do. When there was more time I
would find a bit of wire.
So the 15 ladies, with very little to do all winter, had worked away
at the string until it burst. Then with persistence they had eventually
managed to unshoot the bolt and escape.
Usually vagrant cattle make straight for either their mothers or their
brothers and The Farmer is wakened by the delighted roaring, kicking
over of bags and trampling of feed that ensues.
But in this case they just vanished. There were none of the usual
signs, not even a trail of dung. I would have thought that someone had
come with a lorry and loaded them up had it not been for the fact that
there was one heifer left in the court. She must have been asleep, when
they had sped away.
With no staff to call on, I went on Honda, the four-wheeled dog, in
search of my heifers. I found three in our last field of rape and I was
able to open a gate and let them on to our hill.
After searching in ever-increasing circles, I found four more only two
farms away looking bemused in a ploughed field. I do not know what I was
thinking about but I tried to get them to submit by chasing them round
and round the field while my poor old bones were practically shaken to
bits by the roughness of the terrain. When I did get them out I ran slap
into one of the sad facts of modern Aberdeenshire.
Now that most fields are down to permanent cropping very few of them
have gates and none is kept shut. My heifers just walked straight into a
field of spring barley. In half-an-hour I had got them one field nearer
home.
I went home for the Wasting Asset who was up despite it being no more
than nine o'clock. The Breadwinner said that the remaining seven heifers
had been located. They were at the Salmon Inn.
My hope was that the heifers would recognise me and a yellow feed bag
and follow me home with the Wasting Asset, in the car, encouraging them
from the rear. This worked well for two fields until we came across
another hazard of the modern countryside; a clueless canine. When my
heifers saw their first yappie dog they were off.
There was no way they were going for the feed bag gag twice so we
would try to drive them home. Now we were joined by two youths, so the
team was up to four but driving cattle is virtually impossible along
country roads nowadays.
As well as the gates being non-existent the fences are also
negligible. As soon as they tired of the hard road (which was very soon)
they just scattered over the fence into whatever field was next.
To cut a horrendous story short we eventually got them home and on to
our braes having been on six different farms. They and we and Honda the
dog had charged about on all their fine new crops, and created a
spectacular mess. That included the final desperate pursuit involving
seven herders on foot and me, as Colonel in chief on the dog, in a
high-speed, cross-country chase which gave me my first insight into what
fox hunting must be like.
When I shut the gate on the last four heifers I had been chasing
cattle without a break for almost five hours.
They were now among our hill cows and when they came in for their cake
the next morning the heifers came too. I was able to shut the door, wile
them and return them to their court. When I sell them in a fortnight's
time I'll be able to say truthfully: ''Been outside.''
When I was telling the boys at the discussion group most of them made
quite a good show of being sorry for me. Even Mossie refrained from
calling me a damned fool. ''It's nae for me to say,'' he said almost
kindly, ''but should you nae have shut the gate right in the first
place?''

MY Lords, ladies and gentlemen, it's Showtime. Whether it's Las Vegas
or the Kelvin Hall, many of today's big boxing matches seem to kick off
with the nauseous drawl of a fresh-faced American MC. If I were a boxer,
I'd be more inclined to punch his obsequious, grinning face into
submission rather than that of my opponent.
Of course, he has only a bit-part in the production, but the amount of
time given to hype, build-up, and the belittling of opponents in boxing
nowadays seems to be very much in inverse proportion to the time spent
in the ring.
Everyone seems to have to make an entrance to top their opponent's,
whether it's Chris Eubank and his Simply The Best theme tune and the
extravagant jump over the ropes into the ring, or Nigel Benn, who has
gone through many metamorphoses from Dark Destroyer to serious good guy.
The hype reached a peak last month with the release of Mike Tyson from
prison in Indiana after three years. There were probably more members of
the press outside the jail that day to see a rapist released than there
were when Nelson Mandela was freed in South Africa.
On Saturday, a grandfather will go into the ring to defend a world
heavyweight title against a German 19 years younger than him. And the
hype goes on.
Years ago, everybody knew who the heavyweight champion of the world
was without having to think about it. But now there are four heavyweight
titles. Of course, that's all down to greed, TV rights, and dire
mismatches.
In the build-up to Saturday's contretemps, George Foreman doesn't have
much to say about his opponent, Axel Schulz. Hardly surprising, as the
German isn't even ranked in the IBF top 12. But grandpa George does have
plenty to say about Tyson.
He has issued a public challenge, accusing Tyson of ''hiding from a
46-year-old man.'' The IBF champion says: ''The word now is come and
fight.''
FOREMAN says he contacted Tyson in prison to set up a $100m fight, but
Tyson had refused to consider it. Once described by ''The Greatest'' --
Muhammad Ali -- as the baddest man alive, Foreman says this is going to
be his last year in the ring and he wants to end his career with a
contest against Tyson. So the offer still stands.
Ole George has had a fairly topsy-turvy career. He became the oldest
man to win a world title in any division last November by knocking out
Michael Moorer, 20 years younger than him, in their IBF and WBA title
fight.
That must rank as one of the biggest upsets in boxing history, and
apparently came as somewhat of a surprise to the Foreman family.
George's younger brother, Roy, passed out in the ring after the
tenth-round knockdown.
''I've exorcised the ghost of Ali once and for all,'' said Foreman
after his victory, 20 years after having lost to Ali in the Rumble in
the Jungle in Zaire.
Three years later he retired before making a comeback in 1987. His
character has gone through as many changes. As a youth he was an
alcoholic and a mugger. He says he was ''the rottenest of God's people''
but since then he has become a God-fearing, dog-loving family man.
However, the preacher with a new-found compassion for his fellow man
can still be as mean-spirited as anyone once he's inside the ring.
Foreman's fight in Las Vegas on Saturday will be for only the IBF
title. He was stripped of the WBA title because he refused to fight the
No.1 contender, Tony Tucker.
Instead, he chose to set up the match with Schulz, carefully selected,
like many of Frank Bruno's opponents. After all, why should Foreman pick
an opponent to whom he's likely to lose?
In a bid to promote the fight, Foreman makes much of the amount of
training he has been doing in isolation in Texas.
''No steaks, no hamburgers, so I'm in good shape. I'm going to have to
fight this thing to the end. It's going to be a tough fight.''
In reality, the plodding, deliberate Schulz must have little chance of
being Germany's first world heavyweight champion since Max Schmeling in
the 1930s.
Foreman's record of 73 wins and only four losses is impressive,
especially against a tailor-made challenger, the chance of a match with
Tyson, and the enormous purse involved; all too appealing for Foreman to
show any compassion to his European opponent.
Perhaps, in future, the MC should begin with: ''My Lords, ladies, and
gentleman, it's hype time again.''

<HEADLINE>Hendry ready to face the boy wonder Scotland's world champion warns John Higgins: 'The Crucible is my place'</HEADLINE>

THE lunchtime trade were milling around the bar, ordering drink and
snacks. A group of women who looked as though they were taking a break
from the day's shopping stood off to the right. They were chatting about
an absent friend and planning a reunion.
Away from all of them, Stephen Hendry MBE sat in a corner keeping his
own counsel. Occasionally he would flick over a page of his newspaper.
The bar area of the John Spencer Snooker Club in Stirling, which has
been Hendry's base since the beginning of his rise to fame, seemed an
incongruous setting to find him in the days before launching his attempt
to become the first player to win four successive snooker championships
of the world. Surely he should have been locked away in a large, quiet
room with one bright light suspended over a snooker table.
However, Hendry remained untroubled by the steady flow of customers
who seemed to be unaware of his presence. He was allowed to remain
untroubled, and no-one approached holding out pen and paper and saying:
''Stephen, if you could. It's not for me, you understand, it's for
little Johnny.''
Even as he left his corner and strolled back to work, he wasn't given
a second glance. Some things never change, it seems.
Hendry, who is still only 26, has been going to work at the same
tables in the same club for the past 11 years and he was well known in
that little domain long before his skill and determination made him a
sporting hero. His assault on every title is refined in Spencer's, which
is also home to Team SweaterShop, which has six of its 11 members
competing in the world championship in Sheffield.
As defending champion, Hendry was first into action at the Crucible
Theatre, which by the end of the next fortnight will have become a place
of intense pressure. Practice sessions, up to six hours long, can
prepare a snooker player like Hendry for most of the shots he will be
required to execute, but nothing can ever hone a person for the unique
atmosphere of the Crucible.
Few sporting arenas can test the resolve of men more severely than the
theatre in which Hendry has already triumphed four times.
Another long and demanding journey towards glory began with a 10-3
first-round victory over Stefan Mazrocis on Friday and then he was able
to check on the young pretender to his title.
John Higgins, who has won more ranking points then Hendry this year,
was drawn against another Scot, Alan McManus, whose immense promise of a
couple of years ago has diminished at an alarming rate, and they will
complete their first-round match this afternoon.
Hendry will continue to watch for any signs of weakness. A suspect
temperament might show in a hint of a twitch, a bead of sweat, or it
could be detected in the way a player might chew ever so slightly on his
bottom lip.
Like a disciple of Desmond Morris, the champion's eyes will scrutinise
Higgins' body language as much as his table manners. Hendry is adept at
reading the signs and is aware that Higgins -- who is in the opposite
half of the draw and could meet Hendry only if both survive to final --
is no longer the young, wide-eyed hopeful.
It seems to be bordering on the ridiculous to suggest that a
19-year-old is one of the favourites for a title which often is won by
steely nerve and experience as much as talent, but Higgins' abilities
are such that he is a genuine threat to Hendry's six-year dominance.
Between them, Steve Davis and Hendry have topped the rankings for the
past 15 years, but the new kid is splitting that power pact. The Wishaw
player exhibits an astonishing degree of maturity in his game and, apart
from being a prolific potter, he has an excellent safety game.
He is also regarded as one of the quickest thinkers on the circuit,
but to win the title he may have to beat perhaps the greatest
break-builder the sport has ever seen, and, when it comes to
temperament, Hendry has been solid. His is the way of the stoic. He
never flinches, he rarely smiles. Emotions will be denied for the next
fortnight.
Hendry's temperament and the strength of his desire to win have driven
him to famous triumphs at the Crucible, and even injury and pain can be
set aside.
During a break in a first-round match last year Hendry slipped in his
hotel room and broke a bone in an arm, but with almost constant medical
care he managed to go on and win his third successive world title, and
his fourth in all.
''I don't know how to explain it fully, but the Crucible is my place,
it's where I perform,'' he said. ''It's where snooker players are tested
to their limits and not all of them are up to the challenge.
''When you are standing behind the curtain waiting to go out and play
in a final at the Crucible, it is then that you become acquainted with
real pressure. In fact, there is no point in trying to explain it to
you, because you really have to be in that position. You really have to
be standing there. Waiting.
''It will be interesting to see how John (Higgins) reacts if he gets
that far (it won't be a simple matter to get beyond McManus). There is
no doubt John has the talent to become a world champion, but he should
know I intend to have a say in whether or not he achieves that ambition.
''There are dangers ahead for John and also for me because this
tournament takes so much out of a person, and it is pointless in looking
beyond the next match. Doing so only gives you a sore head. So many
things can go wrong.''
Higgins, who was a team-mate of Hendry for a short spell, has seen his
earnings grow dramatically this year, but apart from the shiny, new
Mercedes parked in the driveway of his parents' home in Wishaw there is
not a lot to suggest fame is a threat to his challenge. John and
Josephine Higgins act like an anchor and so far have done a good job of
keeping their son focused as he attempts to win the world championship
at the first time of asking.
Terry Griffiths, who won the title in 1979, is the only player to have
gone the distance in his Crucible debut, but Higgins has much more
promise than the Welshman. He is in possession of much more self-belief
also and when he says he can go all the way and take over from Hendry as
the youngest winner of the championship, there is never loud
disagreement.
Davis, who lost to Higgins in the final of the SweaterShop
International Open at Bournemouth in February, is full of admiration for
the new kid. ''He has a tremendous all-round game for one so young,''
the six-times world champion said.
Higgins himself says: ''It's my turn. Hand on heart, I believe I can
win the world title.''
It was typical of Higgins, a no-nonsense individual who knows what he
wants and how to get it. He wants Hendry's crown and world No.1 ranking,
which is calculated over a two-year period, and it will be a special
occasion if the Crucible stages its first ever all-Scottish final.
That would please Hendry, who lost 10-8 to Willie Thorne on his
Crucible debut in 1986, but was applauded off the table by his opponent;
especially because he has heard it suggested he has been unable to
impose himself on fellow Scots during competition. ''The two of us
standing waiting to be introduced for the 1995 final? Now that would be
something to relish. That would be a test of ability and nerve, wouldn't
it?''
Hendry left that final question hanging in the air as he returned to
the table. There was a glint in his eye as he potted what had seemed
like an impossible red, but that is what Hendry does. He tackles the
impossible and makes it look easy.
As Higgins himself said, now it's his turn to prove whether or not he
can do the same.

EASTER Saturday is never a time to celebrate success too
enthusiastically; pride comes too easily before a possible fall in the
next round of matches only 48 hours later. That is why numerous teams at
both ends of the table, believing they have made a great step forward,
should beware, lest by tonight they find themselves right back where
they started.
Fragmentation of the Easter programme makes assessment of league
positions all the more difficult. Increasingly reluctant to play twice
in three days -- it used to be three in one weekend with a full Good
Friday programme -- clubs move one fixture or another, with the result
that Saturday was the eighth day in succession of Premiership football.
Happily, however, Blackburn and Manchester United are back in sync at
the top, having played 37 games each and, happily for all neutrals,
United were able on Saturday to pull back two of the eight points by
which they trailed, breathing a little life back into the race just when
they seemed ready to expire.
Alex Ferguson's team are relying on favours from old foes, but you
know what is said about beggars and choosers. It was Leeds United and
Brian Deane who came to their aid with a last-minute equaliser after
Colin Hendry -- increasingly being spoken of as a serious rival to Alan
Shearer and Jurgen Klinsmann in the Footballer of the Year poll -- had
put Blackburn ahead.
United themselves had the luxury of a fixture against Leicester, which
did their goal difference no harm in a 4-0 win (two goals to Andy Cole).
Today they must see off Chelsea, which most manage these days, and hope
for help from neighbours Manchester City, who visit Ewood Park.
The relegation picture has been cleared only to the extent that
Ipswich and Leicester are mathematically down, while failure to win last
week has left Norwich and Crystal Palace as the new favourites to
accompany them. After the traumas of the FA Cup semi-final, Palace
needed the uplift of victory over Tottenham on Friday, which Klinsmann's
late goal denied them. A visit to QPR this afternoon offers little
comfort.
Tottenham is not the place that Norwich would choose to go today,
either, in an attempt to halt their dizzy slide down the table which
manager John Deehan's resignation last Monday has not yet averted.
Remarkably, Arsenal, Manchester City, Coventry, Southampton, Chelsea,
Everton and West Ham all won, their motivation proving greater in many
cases than that of better-placed opponents. Yet because of their fellow
strugglers' success, even Arsenal, who visit Aston Villa this afternoon,
are not yet safe to be able to turn their thoughts to Thursday's
European Cup-winners' Cup semi-final, when they take a precarious 3-2
lead to Italy to meet Sampdoria. Ian Wright scored a hat trick in nine
minutes during their 4-1 demolition of Ipswich.
Gordon Strachan, taken to Coventry to be Ron Atkinson's eventual
successor, showed there is life in his little legs yet by lasting the
full 90 minutes against Sheffield Wednesday.
Most of those in danger at the wrong end of the table (which means the
whole of the bottom half) must travel today -- another reason why they
should not take anything for granted.

AJAX have received an overwhelming vote of confidence from their
players in their attempt to become champions of Europe.
Every player at the Amsterdam club had the opportunity in recent weeks
to move abroad, and every one elected to remain in Holland.
Such a unified front before the Champions' League semi-final return
against Bayern Munich this week says much for their prospects of going
all the way to recapture the dominance the club exerted in the
seventies.
The directors at Ajax, renowned for their foresight and ingenuity,
have been quick to reward this show of loyalty by the players who have
emerged from their own unique coaching system.
Bonuses of #100,000 have already been paid for their endeavours in the
Champions' League. This will be augmented by a further #30,000 if they
win the final.
In addition, #75,000 has been pledged for winning the domestic
championship, which will bring average earnings to around #400,000 this
season.
These financial incentives, Ajax believe, will halt the annual drain
of talent to foreign lands.
The one star they are sadly resigned to losing at the end of this
season is Frank Rijkaard. He, too, had the opportunity to return to
Italy, with Fiorentina, but will retire to concentrate on his mens'
underwear business.
Rijkaard said: ''My last challenge will be to win in Europe with these
wonderfully talented youngsters.
''I have been playing at the highest level for 15 years and that is
long enough. When I leave, I am confident I will have fulfilled all my
ambitions.''
Their new ground, the Ajax Arena, the first in Europe to have a
cantilever roof, will also be completed by next summer.
By contrast, Bayern Munich are so seriously affected by injuries that
they have had to press one of their former players into service from
their club souvenir shop.
Hans Pflugler has been recalled because captain Lothar Matthaeus and
German international defender Thomas Helmer are unavailable.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni insisted: ''Pflugler can still perform as
required. This is no game for youngsters.''
* NAC Breda have filled the void left by Pierre van Hooydonk's
departure for Celtic without spending even a guilder.
The Dutch club, who acquired Graham Arnold on a loan deal from
Charleroi in Belgium, have been rewarded by the Australian striker
scoring 10 goals in as many games.
It will cost NAC #90,000 if they want to secure Arnold on a permanent
basis. This would still leave a handsome profit on the transfer to the
Parkhead club.
* RUUD Gullit will quit Sampdoria for good at the end of this season
and one of his options will be to continue his career in Brazil. Romario
has approached Holland's former captain to join him at Flamengo and help
build his dream team.
The controversial striker, in the middle of a highly publicised
divorce, revealed: ''I said when I returned home that I was not here to
play out my career but to capture another highlight.
''I want to make Flamengo the best team in the world but this can only
be done by importing players from Europe. Gullit is top of my list and
money will not be a problem.
''He is a player I greatly admire, and the people of Rio will be
dancing in the streets if he accepts my offer. His great skill and
charisma will ensure his popularity extends, and Ruud still has so much
to offer football.
''But he must have the motivation to make a fresh start in his career
in Brazil. The fact that he has been approached shows how determined I
am in my ambitions for Flamengo.''
Gullit, who also has offers to play in the J's League in Japan, said:
''I will decide where my future lies at the end of Serie A, and it could
surprise many people.''
* ONE of Europe's most-wanted players, the Slav midfielder Pedrag
Mijatovic, has been offered an improved contract to remain with Valencia
until 2002, and the indications are that he will accept.
* THE thirty-seventh Copa America will be staged in Uruguay from July
5 to 23 and will include USA and Mexico, as well as the 10 countries
which form the South American Confederation.

STENHOUSEMUIR manager Terry Christie recently instructed his players
to keep Derek McInnes quiet, and the importance of that was demonstrated
on Saturday when the midfielder was involved in two of the goals, as
well as most of Morton's pretty football, in their 3-1 win over Clyde at
Broadwood.
But first, some praise for both elements in the crowd of 2338. The
Clyde fans turned out in decent numbers to cheer on their team for what
turned out to be their last meaningful match of the season; and the
large Greenock contingent put their hands together for Jim Brown's
35-yard rocket which gave the home side a glimmer of hope 12 minutes
from time.
The damage was done in the space of six minutes around the half-hour
mark. McInnes robbed defender Jim Thomson, who had a nightmare of a
game, and slipped the ball through for Scott McArthur to run on and pick
his spot. The midfielder then curled in a corner from the left for 2-0.
Clyde had second-half pressure without much threat of penetration and
Morton broke away 15 minutes from time, Derek Lilley setting up Derek
Laing to run through and effectively to end Clyde's season, as all the
other promotion contenders won.
A Martin Mooney penalty gave Dumbarton an early lead against East
Fife, although they had to wait until the final minute before substitute
Colin McKinnon made sure with No.2. The Fifers had Dougie Hope sent off
and David Beaton red-carded in the tunnel.
Stirling Albion had Willie Watters to thank for an early goal and a
superb solo effort for the 2-0 victory that ensured Brechin's
relegation, and there was a double also for Berwick's Paul Forrester in
their 3-0 win at Meadowbank, after a rebound off Graeme Fraser had given
them the lead.
John Clark and Tom Steel punished errors in Stenhousemuir's 2-1 win
away to Queen of the South, whose Colin Campbell was sent off before
Neil Orr's 25-yard consolation.

THE setting was right, with an attendance of 2500 at Victoria Park,
even if the result was wrong for the Dingwall crowd. Ross County lost
1-0 to the leaders, Forfar, who thereby clinched the championship, but
the home side still are well in the hunt for that second promotion
place.
It was close to half-time that a free kick almost 30 yards out allowed
Forfar defender Bobby Mann to crash in the only goal of the game. After
years of near-misses Forfar at last have a reward -- a title to go with
the old second-division championship which they collected with style on
1983-84.
Manager Tommy Campbell revealed the secret of his players' success has
been fitness -- and learning to pass the ball accurately.
However, after the Dingwall fans had allowed Forfar their moment of
glory at the end, came the good news: no other promotion contenders had
gained more than one point. Alloa's visit to Montrose finished goalless,
which was less disastrous for the home side.
It was a day of misbehaviour on a grand scale, with five red cards in
the division. Montrose's Derek Grant was sent off for a foul after an
hour and Alloa substitute Peter Lamont joined him for an early bath.
There was a red card also at Hampden, where Queen's Park did East
Stirlingshire's promotion chances no good by beating them 1-0. It was a
bad day particularly for two 'Shire men. Scott Sneddon -- a former
Spider -- had the misfortune to have a blocked clearance rebound off him
for the only goal, and Peter Dwyer was sent off for an off-the-ball
incident midway in the second half.
Cowdenbeath had two men sent off as they lost 3-1 at home to Caley
Thistle. Scotland's top scorer, Mark Yardley, having cut the deficit to
1-2, followed team-mate Eddie Petrie to the dressing-room. A similar
crowd of about 200 souls with nothing else to do saw headers by
Arbroath's Tom McMillan and David Pew, followed by a John Lindsay
strike, go into Albion Rovers' net at Coatbridge.

THE pre-match talk in the Rothes dressing room at Lossiemouth was of
the revitalisation of Everton and Partick Thistle as the Speysiders
attempted to escape the foot of the table.
Manager Graeme Scott reminded his players how those clubs had reacted
to the threat of relegation and, even though there is nowhere for the
club to drop, Rothes responded with a battling performance which
surprised Lossiemouth. Scott said: ''We rolled our sleeves up and it was
great to beat a team like Lossie.''
Ricky Thomson and Alan MacLean scored to give Rothes only their second
league win of the season, but it was enough to lift them above Nairn
County, who have completed their season.
Lossiemouth got a late consolation from Gary Clark, while manager
Fraser Kellas came off the bench for the last few minutes. It looked
suspiciously like a ''going-away'' gesture prior to an expected midweek
move to take charge of Elgin City.
Unlucky Huntly youngster Stuart Inverarity suffered a broken nose in
an accidental clash with Forres's Sammy Leonce. Martin Stewart and Craig
Yeats netted as the champions cantered to a comfortable win.
Andy Lavelle hit a double as Keith won 2-0 at Fort William and Ronnie
Smith got the winner for Buckie at Brora.

Raith Rovers 0, Airdrie 1
SOME would say that a guy had to be a sandwich short of a picnic to
wish to become a football referee. All of those scurrilous accusations
about eyesight and general appearance, not to mention having no idea as
to the identity of one's parents.
Of course, the performances of some match officials do leave many
neutrals who attend games on a regular basis with the feeling of
disbelief as to how some decision or other has been arrived at. But they
say little, thinking the referee probably had a better view of what was
going on.
However, when a referee is escorted to his car by two burly policemen
long after the action has ceased, it can be taken as read the official
has upset the natives more than somewhat.
Jim O'Hare had the whistle in his hand at Stark's Park on Saturday,
and such was the referee's performance, he actually rendered Raith's
Jimmy Nicholl speechless.
Nicholl is normally eloquent in after-match chats, but the Irishman
dispatched assistant Martin Harvey to answer the questions of the media
people regarding the action.
But wait, slow down. Could it not be, as Nicholl's team had just been
passed at the head of the first division, he was just using the referee
as a get-out? No. O'Hare seemed to stumble from one clanger to another,
but he kept the best until last.
After having dispatched Raith's Ally Graham indoors for two minor
infringements, young Jim then suffered a bout of partial sight failure
when, with almost the last attack of the proceedings, Airdrie's Graham
Hay stuck out a hand to deflect the ball away from his side's danger
zone.
The word ''penalty'' went up, perhaps startling some shoppers in the
town centre a mile away, while the Airdrie players' heads sank into
their chests. However, remembering the 89 other minutes which O'Hare had
just turned in, it was not such a shock to witness him galloping away
from the scene of Hay's dastardly deed having seen nothing untoward.
Harvey looked a little shocked as he slouched back in the manager's
chair. ''You cannot legislate for some of the decisions that are being
made at the moment,'' he said. ''But we will get on about our
business.''
Of course, the Airdrie success puts them right back into the promotion
picture, a point not lost on their manager, Alex MacDonald.
''It's getting exciting now at the top,'' he said. ''I'm just glad
that we're now back in it instead of going out of it.''
He had a good view of Steve Cooper's winner right on half-time, but
MacDonald claimed to suffer the same afflication as Mr O'Hare in the
same penalty area 45 minutes later when his man handled. ''I never saw
it,'' said the manager, battling well to keep a straight face.
It would be unfortunate -- not to say expensive -- if Saturday's
result was enough to knock Raith Rovers out of their stride at such a
crucial stage of the league campaign.
Perhaps the powers that be within the sport's hierarchy should take a
little more care when dispatching officials to games that can have
far-reaching effects on sides, choosing only the best for such
afternoons.
But will there be enough good men to go around?

Falkirk 3, Motherwell 0
FIRST there was the fairy-tale entry of Raith Rovers into Europe by
virtue of their Coca-Cola Cup win over Celtic; then, just nine days ago,
the prospect of Airdrie joining them became a possibility when they beat
Hearts in the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup; now Falkirk are knocking
loudly on the door for a place in next season's UEFA Cup.
Less than two months ago, Jim Jefferies' side looked more like
candidates for the drop, but new signings such as Steve Kirk, Paul
McGrillen, and Maurice Johnston have helped build a run in which they
are unbeaten in seven matches. When they overpowered Motherwell at
Brockville on Saturday for their fourth successive win, they jumped into
third spot in the table.
A first appearance in Europe is certainly not beyond them, and there
is a strong belief in the camp that they will not lose a match between
now and the end of the season.
Johnston, rescued by Falkirk last month from an indefinite
''sentence'' in Hearts' reserve side, is enjoying his football once more
and said: ''We are working hard in every department and the way we are
playing I don't think anybody can stop us. The atmosphere in the
dressing room is amazing -- the best I have experienced since my days
with Partick Thistle.
''You come here in the morning and get a good laugh with the lads.
Everyone gets on with one another and that attitude carries on to the
pitch.''
Jefferies also believes that Europe is now a genuine target after
victory over Motherwell. He said: ''Even though we won 3-0, it was the
back four who won the match for us. They gave nothing away and
Motherwell were allowed only a few chances.
''We are coming with a late run and could grab that European place.
There are people around here who do believe that we won't lose again
this season, and we still have two big matches against Hibs and Celtic
to come.''
Falkirk got off to the best possible start on Saturday when Kirk,
signed from Motherwell last month, was allowed a free header in the box
after seven minutes and put the home side ahead. David Weir grabbed the
second six minutes after half-time after Motherwell had again boobed at
a high cross, and substitute Steve Fulton scored a goal of class in the
final minute when Motherwell goalkeeper Steve Woods gifted the ball to
Johnston.
The Fir Park side, who only a few weeks ago looked long odds on to
finish second in the title race, have now won only one match in their
past seven and Europe is stretching further away from them. Saturday's
performance was dismal and manager Alex McLeish kept them locked in the
dressing room for 75 minutes after the final whistle.
As Brockville staff wondered if they would make it home in time to see
the nine o'clock news, one said: ''Just throw the keys into the dressing
room and tell them to lock up when they're finished.''
When people with white coats began to move along the corridor in the
direction of the away dressing room, we thought it was all a bit much.
It turned out, however, that the white-coat brigade were catering staff
and not about to distribute straitjackets.
When McLeish emerged, he looked remarkably calm. ''We just tried to
have a sensible chat about it all,'' he said. ''After that talk they
should be desperate to play again and show what they are capable of.
They know they are better than that.
''Falkirk scored in their first move into our box -- Stevie Kirk came
back to haunt me -- and that set the tone. We just didn't handle high
balls into our penalty area, which is a pretty basic thing. I actually
considered playing myself, but I lack match fitness. Now they will have
to learn how to combat teams who bombard us in the air. It was Partick
Thistle last week, and now Falkirk.
''Apart from that, our players had an end-of-the-season look about
them. They were so flat. If we don't qualify for Europe, I want to go
out with a bang, not a whimper. I will not accept them running up a
white flag.''

WITH just over a week to the semi-finals of the OVD Cup, the
contenders continued their build-up with varied fortunes. Only Glenafton
registered an outright victory with a 4-0 win over Kello Rovers thanks
to goals from Archer, Millar, Moore and new signing from Largs Thistle
Steven Quigg.
Camelon were held to a 1-1 draw in their Whyte and MacKay Cup tie.
Leading 1-0 through a David Flynn goal they lost an 86th-minute
equaliser to Arniston Rangers.
Whitburn desperate for points to close the gap on league leaders
Camelon could only manage a 0-0 draw against Bonnyrigg Rose and Lochee
United defeated Scone Thistle in the Cream of the Barley Cup 4-1 on
penalty kicks after drawing 2-2.
In the Ayrshire Region, Auchinleck bounced back from their shock 2-1
midweek defeat by Darvel to beat Irvine Vics 2-1 and draw level on
points with Kilwinning Rangers at the top of the Western Stagecoach
League. Leaders Kilwinning led Irvine Meadow courtesy of of ex-Clydebank
player Kenny Wilson but Meadow levelled through Milton Thompson goal.
Two goals from striker Scott McKernan and another from centre half Barry
McCorriston gave Beith a convincing 3-1 win over Kilbirnie in the
Cunningham Cup.
Largs Thistle continued their good run since the arrival of new team
manager David McKellar with a 1-0 victory over fellow relegation
candidates Darvel. An 85th-minute headed goal from Martin Gray gave them
the points and a fighting chance of staying up.
Pollok, with only one defeat in the Reebok Premier Division this
season continued on their winning way on Saturday with a 3-0 win over
Shotts Bon Accord. Despite having the better of the first half, Shotts
lost two goals -- a Benny Rooney header and a Danny O'Halloren tap in --
in a five minute period just before half-time. Substitute McGrogan
completed the scoring five minutes from time.
